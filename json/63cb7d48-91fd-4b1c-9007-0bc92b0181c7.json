We\u2019ll have to work through dinner,\u201d Dante Damaso commanded as he tugged off his tie with one hand and poured himself a brandy with the other.</p><p>Cleopatra Pandora Knight stared at her boss with a simmering resentment that she hid behind a mask of impassivity. She was exhausted. They had landed at Narita airport that afternoon and had hit the ground running, with one meeting after the next, as they attempted to deal with the bureaucratic red tape that had delayed the start of construction on Dante\u2019s new hotel. All she wanted was a hot shower and a good night\u2019s sleep since she knew that she had to face more of the same frenetic pace tomorrow.</p><p>Sadly, that was not to be; the boss wasn\u2019t done working, and that meant no sleep for Cleo until he said so.</p> <p>\u201cYes, Mr. Damaso,\u201d she said demurely, keeping her voice low and emotionless. He didn\u2019t acknowledge her response, picking up a newspaper and perusing the headlines with the intense focus he gave whatever activity he happened to be engaged in at any given moment. Recognizing the dismissal, Cleo turned and headed for her room.</p><p>When Cleo realized that she would be sharing the penthouse suite of one of the most exclusive hotels in Tokyo with her boss, she had a moment of panic. Until she\u2019d seen the suite. Her entire apartment back in Cape Town could fit into this place several times over. It had three huge bedrooms, two full bathrooms, and a living room. Nothing but the best for Dante Damaso. Until his hotel was built, he would stay in what would soon be the second best hotel in Tokyo.</p><p>Cleo rolled her head on her shoulders and listened to her neck creak with the movement. God, she felt like she could sleep for a week, whereas the boss barely looked winded. It was a little infuriating how indefatigable he was, especially since it impacted Cleo directly. She sighed and allowed herself a moment of self-pity before rummaging through her suitcase for a change of clothing, and padding to the bathroom.</p><p>She was back in the living room exactly forty minutes later, dressed in a modest blue slip dress in which she felt a lot more comfortable than the suits she was required to wear for this job. Her short bob was still damp from the shower, and she hadn\u2019t bothered with makeup. She hoped that the boss wouldn\u2019t mind her lack of formality and was relieved to note that he\u2019d removed his tie, unbuttoned the top two buttons of his white shirt, and folded back his shirtsleeves to reveal extremely masculine forearms. Her favorite kind\u2014strong, lightly dusted with hair, with raised veins mapping a path to his capable-looking hands.</p><p>He looked up and grunted when she entered the room.</p> <p>\u201cGood, you\u2019re back. We have to go through today\u2019s minutes and compile a list of the most pertinent facts. Then take care of the day\u2019s correspondence. You get started on that; I have to make a few phone calls.\u201d</p><p>He turned away from her and lifted his phone to his ear. Cleo stared at his broad back for a moment before trudging over to the laptop with a muffled sigh. She wondered if he\u2019d ordered room service yet; she was starving. She glanced around the room and gasped in outrage when she saw the room-service cart standing off to the side of the room, with the uncovered empty plates precariously stacked one on top of the other. Another quick look around the room told her that there was definitely no other food around. Had he actually forgotten to order something for her? Was the man wholly incapable of thinking of anybody but himself? She picked up the room telephone to order her own meal, but he had finished his call and cast her a sharp look.</p><p>\u201cStop wasting time, Knight,\u201d he growled, tapping away at the screen of his phone. \u201cWe have a lot of work to do. I didn\u2019t bring you along to sit around looking pretty and doing nothing.\u201d</p><p>The injustice of that statement left her fuming, and she bit back a sarcastic retort, knowing that she had no alternative but to swallow down the anger she felt toward him. Cleo knew that\u2014due to the last-minute nature of this trip\u2014she\u2019d been his only choice as assistant. And since the man had avoided testing her full potential in the office up until now, he didn\u2019t trust her to get anything done competently. Still, Cleo had jumped at the opportunity to join him. The heady excitement of a trip to Japan combined with the desire to prove herself capable of doing this job to both Dante Damaso and to herself had proved hard to resist. Yet now, feeling completely overwhelmed, all she wanted was to run back home with her tail between her legs.</p><p>All because her boss was doing his level best to be an ass.</p><p>Don\u2019t respond! Don\u2019t respond! She repeated the two words over and over to herself. No mouthing off at the boss, no matter how much he deserved it.</p> <p>An hour and a half later, after they had powered their way through a series of e-mails and memos and had pored over her notes from the day\u2019s many meetings, Cleo was starting to feel cross-eyed from staring at the computer screen too long. Her brain was scrambled, and she was practically drooping with exhaustion. Even though she hadn\u2019t eaten since the flight\u2014a decade ago\u2014she was too damned tired even to think about her stomach.</p><p>Dante Damaso peered at her when she stopped tapping at the keys and frowned over the top of his black-rimmed glasses.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a five-minute break,\u201d he suggested, and Cleo almost melted into a puddle of gratitude. She stretched lavishly and enjoyed a jaw-popping yawn at the same time. A quick look at her boss told her that while he had suggested a break, he wasn\u2019t taking one himself\u2014his head was once more bent over zoning ordinances and blueprints. The man really was tireless, a trait that she found both admirable and frustrating at the moment. She supposed years of international travel and frantic work schedules had inured him somewhat to the effects of a forty-eight-hour-long day, one that had started on a completely different continent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She padded over to the huge floor-to-ceiling window that overlooked Tokyo in all its sparkling glory. She had never seen anything remotely close to this spectacular view. The city was vast, and its lights sprawled as far as the eye could see. Despite being forty floors removed from the heaving excitement of the city, Cleo could feel it calling to her like a seductive siren.</p><p>She turned away from the allure and found herself inadvertently appreciating a spectacular view of a different kind. Big, sexy Dante Damaso as she had never seen him before, ruffled, stubbled, and completely disheveled. The look suited him and gave him an edge that the normally smooth, urbane man kept hidden beneath layers of intimidating sophistication and flawless tailoring. It was an image of the man she really preferred not to have in her head, because it made him seem a lot more human\u2014more approachable\u2014than he usually was.</p><p>He looked up and happened to catch her eye, and even from across the room, she could see something spark and smolder in his gaze. It was gone in a flash, and she wondered if her tired brain had tricked her into seeing things. She wandered over to the exquisite coffee table where she had left her cell phone to charge and checked her messages. A couple from her brother, Luc, and her best friend, Cal, and one informing her that she could very well have won five hundred grand already! Fantastic. She allowed herself a moment of pure whimsy\u2014with her \u201cwinnings\u201d there\u2019d be no further need to spend her mornings making coffee, watering Dante Damaso\u2019s precious ficus, or sending the polite equivalent of \u201cThanks for the sex. Let\u2019s never see each other again\u201d notes with flowers to her boss\u2019s random lady friends. In the nearly four months that she\u2019d been working for him, she\u2019d already sent five notes accompanying equally polite, pretty floral tributes. It was sickening.</p><p>Her nose wrinkled at the thought, and she jumped guiltily when the object of her thoughts called her name curtly.</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady to get back to work?\u201d</p><p>Not really.</p><p>\u201cOf course, sir,\u201d she said, proud that she managed to keep her voice relatively emotionless.</p><p>She sat down at the antique secretary that she had claimed as her workstation and tried to hide her wince when her butt and back hit the hard, unforgiving surface of the ornate high-back chair. She rolled her shoulders and sighed quietly as she closed her eyes and kneaded the tightly knotted muscles in the back of her neck.</p> <p>\u201cTired?\u201d</p><p>She jumped when Damaso\u2019s voice came from behind her, and she looked up over her shoulder to meet his dark, enigmatic gaze. He\u2019d come up to within half a yard of the back of her chair and had his hands shoved into his trouser pockets. He was staring down at her, his eyes narrowed and intent.</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>He nodded, never taking his eyes off hers, and seemed to weigh his next words before speaking.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a neck rub?\u201d</p><p>Cleo blinked, shocked by both the question and the heat that flared in his eyes. She knew very well what that neck rub would entail, where it would lead, and he meant for her to know that. Until that very moment, she would never have guessed that the man had even noticed her as a female, yet the way he was looking at her right now told her that he very much appreciated what he was seeing. He kept his hands to himself and his expression\u2014despite everything going on in his eyes\u2014impassive. If she refused his offer and all it entailed, she imagined he would simply shrug it off, and they would carry on as if this crazy moment had never happened.</p> <p>The question was . . . did she want to refuse him? She was tired, frustrated, and his offer could be a fantastic way to let off steam and unwind after a hard day. Who would it harm? They were both consenting adults. There was no romance or love or hearts and flowers here. She might dislike him, but she\u2019d be lying to herself if she didn\u2019t admit to feeling sexually curious about him. Maybe just this once? Just a taste. This was sex, plain and simple, and sometimes that\u2019s really all anybody needed.</p><p>Dante Damaso watched the play of emotions on his assistant\u2019s ridiculously expressive face. Shock and confusion, followed by intrigue, trepidation, and definite interest. He couldn\u2019t have surprised himself more with that damned question. She was a tempting little thing, which he\u2019d been trying damned hard to overlook in light of their personal connection through her brother. To that end, he limited the amount of time he spent with her as much as possible. But right now he was as human as the next guy. He was irritated by the way his day had gone, and his frustration built as the hours wore on with little progress being made. Now, after seeing this woman in her distracting blue dress, he was also horny as hell. He could do something about at least one of those things, but if she wasn\u2019t interested, they\u2019d move on. It would probably be for the best anyway, considering the spur-of-the-moment nature of his proposition. He should withdraw his offer and leave it at that. After all, he couldn\u2019t think of a more inappropriate\u2014</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d Her whispered words brought his commonsense train of thought to a screeching halt, and his jaw dropped as he watched her dip her head, allowing the sharply defined points of her sleek bob to swing forward and hide her face. His throat went bone-dry, and all sound judgment fled as he watched his hands reach for that vulnerable nape. He hesitated just shy of touching her and inhaled deeply, catching a whiff of the fresh, floral scent that had tantalized his senses all evening. When his fingers finally made contact with her soft, exposed flesh, his breath shuddered out of his chest in tandem with hers.</p><p>He was instantly, painfully, and immutably hard, and he allowed himself to deepen his touch, even though every instinct in him was screaming that this was a mistake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This is a mistake. The thought\u2014which had been buzzing around in Cleo\u2019s head from the moment of initial contact between them, through their first stunning kiss, into the shedding of her clothing, and then when his mouth latched onto her breast for the first time\u2014was getting ever more insistent. But Cleo had more interesting things to focus on, like the way his large, assertive hand was making its way down her body to . . .</p><p>\u201cOh God!\u201d she moaned as that hand did magical, sinful, unimaginable things. Her back arched, and his smoldering gaze fell to the beaded tips of her breasts. She uttered another breathless little cry when his hot mouth fixed on one hypersensitive nub. Her fingers curled into his silky hair as she tried to keep him there.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t . . .\u201d Her voice tapered off into a high-pitched whine when his supremely talented mouth left her breast only to lavish the same treatment on the other mound.</p><p>She could feel his hot hardness poised at her entrance, and her hands left his hair to claw at his back and tight buttocks, trying to pull him toward her. He lifted his head to stare down at her, his eyes feverish as they pinned her with single-minded concentration.</p><p>\u201cYou want me?\u201d</p><p>God, his sexy voice, roughened with desire and strain, nearly made her come right on the spot. She couldn\u2019t quite believe how much he was making her feel, how very much she wanted him inside her. She couldn\u2019t remember wanting any other man half as much as she did this one. And yet . . .</p><p>This is a mistake!</p><p>The words had grown shrill and insistent, but Cleo pushed them away as she reached up for another one of those drugging kisses.</p><p>He complied, but only for the very briefest of seconds. Her frustration reached new heights when he took himself in hand and deliberately ran his blunt, sheathed tip down her slick, sensitive channel. From the tight bundle of nerves at the apex, slowly back down to her entrance, where he came to rest for a long, aching moment.</p><p>\u201cYou want this? Yes?\u201d He pressed forward slowly, and she hissed when she felt him breach her, so much thicker and harder than she had ever had before.</p><p>MISTAKE! The clamoring was incessant, but she ignored it again and arched toward him.</p><p>He refused to comply, remaining still, not even breathing, giving her just that one small taste of what was to come.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed? Yes?\u201d His voice remained annoyingly steady, but the fevered gleam in his eyes told her he wasn\u2019t as indifferent as he seemed.</p><p>\u201cYes! Damn you.\u201d She truly hated him in that moment, and a bit of venom seeped into her voice. \u201cYes, I want you. I crave this. I need . . . oh.\u201d This last as he inched forward with such slowness and care that it felt like forever before he was buried from tip to hilt. He was almost uncomfortably large, and it took her out of the moment for a brief second. Sensing her discomfort, he rested there and gave her time to adjust to his size while he lowered his head and focused his lavish attentions on her breasts again. He braced one of his hands on the bed beside her head, keeping his weight off her, and allowed his other hand to go roaming. When that hand finally dawdled its way down to where they were joined, Cleo was already arching her hips toward his. He grinned and slid his free hand under her to palm her butt and adjust her position. He sat upright, knelt between her spread thighs, and dragged her even closer.</p><p>It was a seriously sexy position, sprawled flat on her back while he feasted his eyes on her uninhibited nakedness. He lifted her higher, forcing himself even deeper inside, and then, with a wicked grin, finally began to move again.</p><p>\u201cPlay with your breasts!\u201d he commanded, his voice sounding a little breathless. She complied, rolling the distended nipples between her thumbs and fingertips, then flicking at them. He grunted in approval and moved his hands to her hips, angling her upward while he continued his assertive thrusting. God, he is magnificent. Sweat beaded on his forehead, dampened his hair, and added a fine sheen to his bronzed skin. He kept his focus on where they were joined, watching intently as he plowed into her tightness. His brow furrowed and his chest heaved, the first real signs that he was as affected as she was.</p><p>\u201cGive me your hand,\u201d he growled, and she reluctantly released one taut nipple and lifted her right hand toward him. He didn\u2019t release her hips. Instead, he leaned down, captured her middle finger in his hot mouth, and sucked it inside. After one final seductive lick, he released her finger.</p><p>\u201cTouch yourself,\u201d he said, and she groaned before obediently doing as he had commanded. \u201cGood.\u201d The word was so gruff it was barely recognizable.</p><p>Cleo was unbelievably turned on by the picture she presented to his lascivious gaze. She had never been sexually shy, but this was . . . this was way beyond anything she\u2019d ever experienced. Her back arched off the bed, her thighs lay sprawled across his, and she was quite unashamedly pleasuring herself for his\u2014and her own\u2014gratification. This was complete abandonment with the least likely man in the world, and she wasn\u2019t at all sure how she\u2019d gotten here.</p><p>She was well past the point of no return and the inevitable was but a heartbeat away, and then . . . it was there and so cataclysmic that her whole body simply clenched. The sharp cry that she uttered died in her throat as every single atom of her being focused inward on an explosion of pleasure so powerful it tore her apart and left her feeling vulnerable and emotionally raw.</p><p>His orgasm finally took him. She watched in fascination as his eyes slid shut, his head flew back, and every cord in his neck stood out in stark relief. He gritted his teeth, preventing even the faintest of sounds from emerging. Only the sharp catch and gradual release of his breath gave any indication of how much the climax had affected him. She resented his control. Hated how she had given herself so completely while he, for all intents and purposes, had kept a cool head from that first kiss to this last lazy thrust. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His grip on her thighs finally loosened, and she imagined she\u2019d have bruises in the shape of his fingertips on her butt and thighs by morning. She could barely move as he smoothly extricated himself from her, tugged off the condom, and fell flat on his face on the bed beside her, his long, muscular legs still entangled with hers.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Chloe. I needed that.\u201d His voice was slurred. He sounded like a very drunk or very tired man, and the gentle snore that followed a mere second later confirmed the latter fact. Cleo sighed, trying not to be completely demoralized by the fact that this man, whom she had known for nearly four frickin\u2019 months, had just called her by the wrong name. She maneuvered her way completely out from beneath him, sat on the side of the bed, and pushed herself up onto unsteady legs, feeling like a newborn calf. She knew she should probably get back to her own room, because she very much doubted that he would appreciate waking up with her still beside him.</p><p>She hunted around the room for her dress and underwear but couldn\u2019t find her panties. Why did it have to be her panties? She dressed hastily and was thankful that her walk of shame would span only the length of his room to the connecting door that led to her room. Nobody else would see her.</p><p>When she had the door firmly shut behind her, she wobbled over to the bed, where most of the contents of her suitcase were chaotically strewn all over the duvet cover, and sank down in relief. Her entire body still shook in the aftermath of the best sex\u2014and the biggest mistake\u2014of her life.</p> <p>She buried her face in her hands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just sex,\u201d she told herself, and was embarrassed by the unsteady pitch of her voice. And by the lie. She was definitely embarrassed by the blatant lie, even if the only person she was trying to deceive was herself. That wasn\u2019t just sex. That had been the most mind-numbing, bone-melting, awe-inspiring forty-five minutes of her life, and there was no getting around that. The irritating man certainly knew his way around a woman\u2019s body. Her nipples ached just thinking about it, and to be frank, everything else was still tightening and convulsing in the aftermath of the soul-shattering orgasm she\u2019d just had.</p><p>But to sleep with Dante Damaso? She shuddered in a way that had nothing to do with the microexplosions still tingling all over her body and everything to do with the fact that she could barely stand the man. So what if he was mouth-wateringly gorgeous? He was still an obnoxious, misogynistic jerk with a smug self-assurance that rubbed her the wrong way every time he spoke. Then there was the way he practically sneered every time he said Miss Knight, or the way he couldn\u2019t seem to look at her when he talked to her, or seemed incapable of a single please or thank-you. And\u2014horribly\u2014after one stupid mistake on her very first day of work, he now insisted on painstakingly checking every single letter she typed for him before she was allowed to e-mail it. It was humiliating, and while the mistake hadn\u2019t been repeated since then, he made it absolutely clear that he did not trust her to do anything more challenging than make coffee, water the plant, and send his kiss-off notes. Of course, he didn\u2019t micromanage the rest of his staff the way he did Cleo, and she knew if he weren\u2019t one of her brother\u2019s buddies, Dante would probably have fired her within the first week. But she was damned if she\u2019d quit, the way he obviously expected\u2014wanted?\u2014her to.</p><p>And she had slept with him. She couldn\u2019t even blame alcohol, exhaustion, or temporary insanity . . . hold on. Maybe she could blame temporary insanity. She must have lost her mind. Why else would she have slept with the condescending, arrogant bastard?</p><p>She headed toward the en suite bathroom, tugging off her hopelessly wrinkled dress as she went. She fumbled with the complicated bells and whistles in the shower cubicle. It\u2019s a shower; why is it so damned difficult anyway? She finally got the water going and gratefully stepped beneath the powerful spray before swearing and fumbling with the knobs and buttons to set it to a temperature less than scalding.</p> <p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d The words were mild but heartfelt. She didn\u2019t know if she was sophisticated enough to be cool about a one-night stand. With her boss. Whom she despised.</p><p>She rested her forehead on the cool tiles before thumping it softly and rhythmically against the unforgiving surface. This was a disaster. She enjoyed sex, but she had never previously indulged outside at least a semicommitted relationship. This was uncharted territory for her. Where did they go from here?</p><p>Of all the stupid . . . She shook herself. She wasn\u2019t achieving anything with the self-recriminations. It had happened. Now she needed to figure out how the hell she was going to get through the rest of their time here and what she would do if she had to find a new job once they got back to Cape Town.</p><p>It would suck if it came to that, because she really enjoyed the challenge of this job. Back in South Africa, Dante regularly swapped her for other executive assistants in the upper echelons of his global, multi-billion-dollar leisure industry conglomerate, and it was on those days Cleo truly liked her new job. None of the other executives seemed to doubt her competence and rarely gave her the mind-numbingly boring and simplistic tasks Dante liked to saddle her with.</p><p>Cleo finished her shower and wrapped herself in the warm terry-cloth robe provided by the hotel. She sauntered over to the huge floor-to-ceiling window and stared out at the sprawling nightscape. She had always dreamed of visiting Japan\u2014had hoped to dance here someday. She allowed herself a small, wistful smile and a momentary pang at the thought of all she\u2019d lost before shoving the memory of what she\u2019d once been able to do\u2014what she still yearned to do\u2014back into a box and placing it into a mental drawer. She could never fully shut that damned drawer; it was always slightly open, and every so often something\u2014the dream of a different life\u2014would escape from it and haunt her reality. She drew in a long breath and released it shakily. She had way too much else going on right now. She couldn\u2019t allow the coulda/shoulda beens to intrude on what was already an emotionally impactful night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She tried to empty her mind of everything and focus only on the view. From her fortieth-floor vantage point, the shimmering lights looked as pretty as a Christmas tree, but she wondered at the constant frenetic activity in this crazy city that didn\u2019t seem to have slowed down at all, despite the lateness of the hour. She knew she should try to get some sleep. It was after three in the morning, and Dante Damaso would undoubtedly be up, dressed, and disgustingly alert by seven. She crawled into the king-size bed, which was positioned so she could still see the skyline. She curled up on her side and stared down at the blinking lights of the traffic far, far below before drifting into a restless sleep.</p><p>Dante woke as he usually did, fully aware of his surroundings and not the slightest bit groggy despite the lack of sleep and jet lag. For once that ability wasn\u2019t a blessing, not when he was immediately bombarded by the memory of the colossal error in judgment he had made the night before.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he hissed beneath his breath, wasting a brief moment of his very precious time on a twinge of regret before shrugging that smidgen of conscience away. Instead he attempted to focus his attention on a solution to what could definitely become a problem. The sex had been quite good, really, and just what he\u2019d needed to blow off the frustrations of the day. But the girl was his employee, a very junior employee\u2014and Dante hardly ever went there. Plus, she was his friend\u2019s sister, and Dante for damned sure never went there. And yet he\u2019d gone there last night and had no one to blame but himself.</p><p>To give Chloe her due, she had never looked at him in that way, never hinted at wanting any form of sexual relationship with him. If anything, until last night, she had been indifferent toward him and even seemed to dislike him at times. He snorted at that last thought, dismissing it as unlikely. When women pretended indifference, they were usually playing hard to get, and she was definitely the type to play ridiculous games like that. Look how easily she\u2019d fallen into his bed last night. Surely that was proof she\u2019d been harboring some sort of attraction for him all along.</p> <p>He just hoped she didn\u2019t think it would be the start of something; he really didn\u2019t need the complication of breaking Luc\u2019s sister\u2019s heart. He liked the guy and they had been friends for a long time\u2014and even though Dante had known of her existence, he had never actually met Luc\u2019s sister until she applied for this job. He hadn\u2019t been too enthused by the idea of giving her the position\u2014especially in light of his unexpected physical response to her presence. But he wasn\u2019t about to offend one of his few real friends by refusing to give the man\u2019s precious sister a job\u2014no matter how woefully underqualified she was on paper.</p><p>He shook himself impatiently, irritated that he had already wasted this much time on the incident when he had to figure out how to approach the precarious situation with the Shinjuku metropolitan government. He resented having to devote any of his time to considering the possible ramifications of his ill-advised sexual encounter with a woman. Not when he had so many other pressing issues to deal with.</p><p>He shook his head as he rose from bed and crossed to the bathroom for a quick shower. He had the utmost confidence he would handle this incident in the best way possible; it was just sex, after all. By the time he was dressed and ready to face the day, he had already dismissed the episode and was focused on other, far more important matters.</p><p>When Cleo joined Dante in the living room, he greeted her with his usual morning grunt, keeping his focus on his laptop.</p><p>\u201cMiss Knight, I need you to send an urgent e-mail to Miles Kinross for the Phase One original blueprints,\u201d he said without looking up.</p> <p>\u201cRight now?\u201d she asked, and he lifted his gaze from the computer screen to frown at her.</p><p>\u201cYes, right now. I wouldn\u2019t use the word \u2018urgent\u2019\u201d\u2014he used mocking air quotes\u2014\u201cif I didn\u2019t want it right now.\u201d</p><p>Cleo gritted her teeth, bit back the sarcastic retort hovering on the tip of her tongue, and settled for saccharine sweetness instead.</p><p>\u201cWell, I only ask, sir, because it\u2019s midnight in South Africa, and Mr. Kinross may not be checking his e-mails. I thought you might prefer the direct approach of a phone call instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen make yourself useful and get him on the line. Be proactive for a change.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her brows and picked up her company phone. She really wished she hadn\u2019t fallen into bed with this man so easily. But having regrets now\u2014while she still sported patches of stubble burn on her inner thighs and her breasts tingled tantalizingly\u2014was a waste of energy. His sultry mouth had trailed over every inch of her skin, and his heavy stubble had left a pale pink trail in some of the places he had lingered. There was even a faint sting in the small of her back, telling her she probably wore the same naughty stubble burn just above her butt.</p> <p>Cleo endeavored not to dwell too much on the unwelcome and intimate physical reminders of her lapse in judgment last night. But that wasn\u2019t an easy thing to do when she could barely suppress a shiver as she recalled how masterfully he had flipped her onto her stomach and dragged his wicked lips down from the nape of her neck to\u2014</p><p>\u201cMiss Knight?\u201d</p><p>Whoa. She snapped out of the raunchy daze and stared blankly into his impatient face.</p><p>\u201cThe phone call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d she sputtered, feeling foolish as she dialed the number.</p><p>Miles Kinross, as she had suspected, had already retired for the night and not alone, if the sultry feminine voice in the background was anything to go by. Kinross was a handsome man and\u2014if office gossip was to be believed\u2014like Dante Damaso, he rarely dated the same woman for longer than a month or two. Cleo was in the middle of explaining what they needed when the phone was yanked rudely from her hand and Dante took over the conversation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She straightened her shoulders, determined to ignore his boorish behavior, and headed over to the lavish buffet breakfast he must have ordered from room service. At least he\u2019d remembered to order enough for two this time.</p><p>She allowed herself another flash of aggravation at the memory of how he had completely overlooked her need for a meal last night. Inconsiderate bastard. No wonder she\u2019d been so susceptible to his dubious charms; she\u2019d been suffering from impaired judgment due to starvation. Dying of hunger now, she heaped her plate with scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, and toast before sitting down to dig in.</p><p>She barely managed more than a mouthful before he concluded his call.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no time for breakfast. We\u2019re running late as it is. Our first meeting is in forty minutes, and the driver has informed me that it\u2019ll take at least half an hour to get there in rush-hour traffic. I don\u2019t want to be late. It\u2019s unprofessional and considered extremely rude in Japan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, but . . .\u201d She stared longingly down at her still-full plate.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d been up earlier, you would have had more time to eat,\u201d he pointed out as he picked up his briefcase.</p><p>Yeah, right. Cleo had dawdled over her morning prep, gathering her courage to face him. She had tried to anticipate every possible scenario: he\u2019d sweep her up into his arms and propose a torrid affair, he\u2019d be unable to meet her eyes and unsure of what to say to her, he\u2019d explain how their indiscretion had been only a passing thing, never to be repeated.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t expected this. This complete lack of acknowledgment of what had been a huge breach of office conduct. In fact, he was so completely normal and unaffected she wondered if he even remembered their little oopsie.</p><p>She shoveled down one last forkful of eggs before getting up with a resigned sigh. She smoothed her black, pin-striped pencil skirt down over her thighs and glanced up in time to catch a smoldering look in his dark eyes.</p> <p>Oh . . . my.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he growled, stepping aside and allowing her to precede him.</p><p>For one glorious moment, that look helped her push aside her insecurities and made her feel powerful and feminine enough to add a deliberate little shimmy to her walk as she sidled past him.</p><p>Dante bit back the stream of profanity threatening to escape his lips and focused instead on internalizing his annoyance. A resurgence of sexual tension was the last thing he needed right now. He\u2019d believed he had successfully put the whole incident firmly behind him, but the way that no-nonsense skirt clung to her pert little ass was more than a little distracting. Especially now that he knew she was probably wearing cute little cotton cartoon-character panties\u2014similar to the ones she\u2019d worn last night\u2014beneath the pin-striped twill. He ground his teeth as he followed her out, forcing his eyes up from the tight curve of her butt to her narrow back, and tried to regain his focus. He was only marginally successful, distracted by the light, fresh scent of her shampoo as it wafted back toward him, and the sassy bounce of her silky hair.</p><p>He battled with his hormones all the way down to the car, where the stifling humidity and heat outside displaced his infuriating horniness with discomfort of a different kind.</p><p>\u201cWow, this humidity is crazy,\u201d his distracting little assistant said as they settled into the air-conditioned black luxury sedan.</p> <p>Dante grunted noncommittally and yanked out his tablet to check his notes for the meeting.</p><p>\u201cIs it always like this in Tokyo?\u201d</p><p>Why the hell was she still prattling on? She rarely made small talk with him, and he preferred it that way. When they did speak, it was strictly work related.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been to Japan before, so I didn\u2019t know what to expect. Weatherwise, I mean. I knew it was summer and knew it would be hot, but I really wasn\u2019t expecting this humidity. I mean, it\u2019s like a sauna out there.\u201d</p><p>He sighed before putting his tablet aside. \u201cChloe,\u201d he said, keeping his voice low so the driver couldn\u2019t hear them. \u201cLast night was just to relieve some of the stress of the day; you know that, right? I don\u2019t usually fuck my employees. Too damned messy.\u201d And quite frankly, he didn\u2019t relish the potential sexual-harassment lawsuits from disgruntled sexual partners in the workplace, but he didn\u2019t tell her that. God knows he didn\u2019t need to plant that idea in her head. And then, of course, there was the fact this had happened so unexpectedly he hadn\u2019t gone to the usual legal lengths to protect himself. He was generally a hell of a lot more careful and more discreet when it came to choosing his sexual partners. He cleared his throat before continuing.</p><p>\u201cWe were both tense and in need of some stress relief. It\u2019s not necessary to make this awkward.\u201d</p><p>She muttered something beneath her breath, and he frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCleo. It\u2019s Cleo,\u201d she said, meeting his gaze head-on, her ridiculously beautiful green eyes brimming with defiance. \u201cMy name\u2019s Cleo, not Chloe.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cRight. Of course.\u201d He cleared his throat. Of course he knew her name was Cleo. He even remembered thinking Cleopatra Pandora Knight was a damned stupid name. But for some reason, after months of calling her nothing but Miss Knight, that pertinent fact had completely slipped his mind. He felt his cheeks heat up as he recalled using \u201cChloe\u201d during and immediately after sex the night before. What kind of asshole forgets a woman\u2019s name while he\u2019s naked in bed with her?</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t worry, I wouldn\u2019t dream of making anything awkward for you. I\u2019m just curious about the country. I\u2019m not fantasizing about some happily-ever-after love affair with you or anything. The thought of that is as distasteful to me as it probably is to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Distasteful? Who the hell did she think she was? Better women than she would kill for the chance of a love affair with him . . . and why the hell was he even offended? She was nothing more than his employee. His very annoying and very temporary employee. So they\u2019d had a little lapse in judgment. So what? Shit like that happened all the time. Not to him, but there was a first time for everything.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just keep our focus on work,\u201d he stipulated. \u201cThe sooner we get this delay sorted out, the sooner we get out of here and on with our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen to that.\u201d</p><p>Cleo was proud of herself. Proud that she had managed to keep her temper in check and her mouth shut. And definitely proud that she had managed to curb the impulse to slap the stupid man right across his handsome, smug face.</p> <p>Just do the job, Cleo. Keep doing the job, and when something more interesting comes along, you can move on with your head held high.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t going to be another one of her failures. Another lost opportunity because she couldn\u2019t hold her tongue or restrain her impulsive nature and uncertain temper. Working for Dante Damaso had tested her to her limits, even though\u2014thankfully\u2014she\u2019d rarely had to deal directly with him until this trip. She wasn\u2019t going to let him ruin this career opportunity for her. The potential for growth in this company was huge; Dante had hired her as a temporary replacement for his pregnant assistant, with the assurance that after Donna returned, they would find a permanent position for Cleo within the company. And while Cleo still wasn\u2019t entirely sure this was the kind of work she wanted to do for the rest of her life, it was what she\u2019d fallen back on when her true vocation had slipped beyond her reach. It didn\u2019t light up all the empty spaces in her soul the way dance did, didn\u2019t inspire her or make her want to leap out of bed in the mornings even when every muscle in her body protested the slightest of movements, but it was something. And she was relatively good at it. So it would have to do.</p><p>Up until this job she\u2019d been drifting from one temp position to the next, but this was the first one offering job security, benefits, and all the other good stuff grown-ups aspired to. Cleo, who had felt like a total failure up until that point, had jumped at the opportunity. God knows she had to stop depending on her big brother to help her out every time she failed at something.</p><p>Luc was getting married soon, and while his fianc\u00e9e, Blue, was a sweetheart, Cleo couldn\u2019t keep staying with him every time she lost an apartment because she was unable to pay the rent. Luc had never minded; he insisted that the house, which had once belonged to their grandparents, was half hers anyway and she had as much right to stay there as he did. But with Luc probably starting a family soon, Cleo just wouldn\u2019t feel right running to him every time life dumped an obstacle on her path. She already felt like a loser. And sleeping with the boss\u2014just another thing in a long line of really bad decisions\u2014intensified that feeling times infinity.</p><p>Cleo had been good at only one thing in her life: dancing. And after years of hard work and countless personal and physical sacrifices, she had been well on her way to establishing herself as a talent of note before an accident just after her twenty-fourth birthday had robbed her of that career path. Doctors told her she would never dance professionally again, and it was a fact Cleo had difficulty accepting. She still felt like she could dance; it was still there in her heart and soul. How could they tell her she couldn\u2019t do the one thing she loved above all else? Without dance in her life, she had found herself rudderless and devastatingly average. Now all she had left were her brain and a sharp tongue that kept getting her into trouble at the worst possible times. That tongue had been responsible for most of her past workplace failures, but her intelligence was what kept her constantly employed, even if she couldn\u2019t quite keep the jobs.</p> <p>She glanced at Dante, who was poring over his iPad again, and managed, barely, to keep from rolling her eyes in derision. She watched him covertly and tried to keep her appraisal objective. He was sickeningly good-looking. Dante Damaso was all gorgeous golden skin, topped with black-as-night wavy hair he kept clipped ruthlessly short and combed back with a conservative side part. There was barely enough of the luxurious, thick and silky mass for a woman to run her fingers through. His honey-brown eyes were framed by lush, long lashes that curled slightly at the ends and stern, straight eyebrows. His mouth had a full, curved bottom lip and a thin, perfectly bow-shaped upper lip, and it would have been beautiful if not for the cynical sneer perpetually twisting his lips whenever she was in his general vicinity. And, of course, he had the straight nose and high cheekbones to go with his perfect looks.</p><p>It was nauseating, really; a crooked nose would have made him more approachable, more human. It was almost obnoxious for him to be this good-looking! And now that she knew what he looked like beneath his expensive, bespoke dark-gray suit, it was even worse. At thirty-three he was in his prime. He had washboard abs, a butt you could bounce a coin off, gorgeously muscled arms, and\u2014her personal weakness\u2014killer thighs and calves. And he certainly knew exactly how to use that perfect body to please a woman. No wonder his gorgeous lady friends were always hanging around even after he ended things with them\u2014mind-blowing sex and multiple orgasms could become dangerously addicting.</p><p>While Cleo could definitely empathize with those women, amazing sex wasn\u2019t enough to make her moon over a guy or she\u2019d be in serious trouble right now. Dante Damaso epitomized masculine perfection; it was a damned crying shame such good looks were wasted on a nasty specimen like him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To distract herself from the awkward situation with her boss, Cleo turned her attention to the city just a window\u2019s breadth away. She couldn\u2019t remember ever seeing this many pedestrians in one place, hustling and bustling and going about their daily lives. She craned her neck and couldn\u2019t prevent a giggle from escaping when she spotted a guy in a panda suit crossing the intersection in front of their car. She scrambled for her phone and managed to catch his back as he walked away, his gigantic panda head towering above the other, completely unconcerned pedestrians. Nobody even stared. She absently started taking a few more pics and then several selfies, trying to get as much of the city in the background as possible and adding the really good ones to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. She positioned herself with her back to the window and took a few duckface selfies while they were stopped at a particularly busy intersection.</p><p>Dante was so engrossed in his reading that it took a while before the annoying clicking sound penetrated the heavy fog of statistics eddying in his brain. When he finally became aware of it, the click that followed was almost jarring as it jerked him fully aware of his surroundings. He looked over to where Chl\u2014Cleo\u2014was sitting on the far end of the backseat and blinked when he saw her sucking in her cheeks, plumping up her lips, and lowering her chin as she held her phone slightly above face level and snapped a photograph. Well, that explained the annoying clicking. She shifted her chin slightly to the left and took another picture. Then another and another.</p><p>\u201cI hate to interrupt this narcissistic little lovefest you\u2019ve got going on with your phone, Miss Knight, but surely you have something a little more productive to do with your time?\u201d</p><p>She jumped and dropped her phone, which bounced off the seat and landed right between his shoes. She swore beneath her breath and bent over to retrieve it. He gaped as she squirmed her way between the front passenger seat and his knee, her round butt sticking up and wriggling temptingly right within cupping range of his hands. He held said hands up and away from her body in case they were tempted to do something stupid, like explore the silky smooth skin of her thighs, which was being revealed one tantalizing millimeter at a time as she maneuvered her way a little farther down.</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t quite sure what to do with the provocative, twisting bundle of femininity half draped over his lap, but when one sharp little elbow missed his groin by just an inch, he cursed and took hold of that same elbow and dragged her up onto the seat beside him.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the ever-loving hell are you doing?\u201d he asked, sounding livid even to himself.</p><p>\u201cMy phone . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I know. And I would have retrieved it for you. You didn\u2019t have to drape yourself all over me to get to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d God, her cheeks were flushed, her usually sleek hair was a mess, and two of her mother-of-pearl blouse buttons had come undone to reveal the pretty blue-lace edge of her bra. She looked like a woman who had just been soundly kissed, and because it aroused him to the point of pain, it brought his suspicious nature to bear.</p> <p>\u201cAre you coming on to me?\u201d he hissed. \u201cWasn\u2019t one night enough for you? If you want more than that, you need but say it. But don\u2019t expect anything other than sex from me. Just because you\u2019re Luc\u2019s sister doesn\u2019t automatically entitle you to more than that. Once we get this deal out of the way, we can fuck again if that\u2019s what you want, but it will never be more than that. Entender? Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I entender,\u201d she said, her voice trembling slightly, making him wonder at the extreme emotion he could sense just beneath the surface. \u201cI entender that you\u2019re a smug, arrogant butthole who thinks the sun revolves around him. I don\u2019t like you. But then I don\u2019t have to like you; you\u2019re just my boss. And while I may have had a moment\u2019s weakness last night, it just makes me human. And trust me, one night was enough to last a lifetime. It was great, but I\u2019m not looking for an encore.\u201d</p><p>Cleo let her words sink in, knowing she had just kissed any future with this company good-bye. She allowed herself a moment\u2019s regret before clearing her throat and pointing to the floor between his feet.</p><p>\u201cNow, would you mind fetching my phone for me please, sir? I\u2019d hate for you to get the wrong idea if I went fishing for it again.\u201d</p><p>He kept his gaze level with hers, and the grim set of his mouth told her he wasn\u2019t at all impressed with her. Well, to hell with him. His opinion mattered not at all.</p><p>\u201cJust because we have shared some level of intimacy does not give you the right to speak to me so,\u201d he said after a long and unnerving moment of silence. His voice teemed with barely restrained menace. \u201cWe are not contemporaries, we are not friends, and we are certainly not lovers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re employee\u201d\u2014she touched her chest and then lifted the same hand to point at him\u2014\u201cand employer. You\u2019re my boss, and as I very much doubt I\u2019ll have a job after this anyway, I should probably voice my opinions now, while I have you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you not have a job after this? You think I am so lacking in morals I would fire you because we spent a mutually pleasurable night together? That was last night, and we were done with work. In this car, right now, I am your employer, and I will be spoken to with respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, does that mean I get to call you an arrogant butthole after hours?\u201d She watched his face tighten and knew she was pushing every single danger button he possessed.</p><p>\u201cWhat you call me in the privacy of your thoughts is of no concern to me. Just keep those thoughts to yourself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re basically placing a gag order on me,\u201d she clarified.</p><p>\u201cIf that is how you wish to perceive it, then so be it.\u201d</p><p>He reached down to retrieve her phone\u2014a clear indicator he considered the conversation closed\u2014and glanced at the screen before handing it over.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t exactly what I would call professional behavior,\u201d he said, nodding down at the ridiculous pouting picture of her on the screen.</p> <p>Embarrassed, she cast her eyes down, hating to feel so completely wrong-footed.</p><p>\u201cIt was meant to be ironic,\u201d she attempted to explain even while she knew he would never understand the intended humor behind the picture.</p><p>\u201cI trust you will conduct yourself appropriately at this meeting?\u201d</p><p>Damn it. So much for trying to impress the man with her professionalism and ability to do the job. She tried her best to keep her reply humble.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. I apologize if my earlier lack of professionalism caused you to think otherwise, sir,\u201d she said in her best no-nonsense voice, although she couldn\u2019t quite disguise the sarcasm dripping all over that last word. He raised his eyebrows, indicating he hadn\u2019t missed the acerbity, then raked her body from top to toe with his gaze.</p> <p>\u201cYou might want to run a comb through your hair,\u201d he said, the words dripping with disdain. \u201cMaybe reapply your lipstick while you\u2019re at it. Oh, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019d like to adjust your skirt and button your blouse before we get there as well.\u201d</p><p>Bastard.</p><p>She scooted back to her end of the seat and quickly straightened her skirt and fumblingly fixed her blouse, flushing a little when she noticed her bra was showing. A quick check of her hair and makeup confirmed the former was sticking up a bit and her lipstick was smudged at one corner of her mouth. Wait, how on earth had she managed to smudge her lipstick while trying to pick up her phone? Who did that? This day just got worse and worse and it wasn\u2019t even eight o\u2019clock yet. She reapplied it and quite pointedly turned her back on him to stare out the window.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to let him dampen her excitement of being here, and if this was all she got to see of the city, then she was damned well going to soak it in while she could. She heard him snort softly behind her but ignored it, willing him to go back to his oh-so-critical preparation. He only needed her here to take notes, write his correspondence, and do all the other menial crap that required little to no thinking.</p><p>She knew Donna, his executive assistant, had a very challenging and intellectually stimulating job\u2014she handled projects, ran the office in his absence, and had all manner of other important and interesting duties. But Dante didn\u2019t trust Cleo to do even a small percentage of what his precious Donna did, and she didn\u2019t expect him to. She was nowhere near as qualified. He gave her the basic secretarial stuff to do while designating the more important tasks to other personal and executive assistants. The little he did entrust to her was always gone over by the man himself with a fine-tooth comb.</p><p>Naturally the other assistants were already swamped with their own regular duties and were starting to resent Cleo for not doing the job she was being so handsomely paid for. They knew Luc and Dante were friends because Cleo had foolishly mentioned it to one of the younger admin assistants in an aborted attempt to make friends. The woman had wasted no time spreading rumors that Cleo had been hired because of the relationship between the two men. Nobody would ever accuse Dante of nepotism to his face, of course, so Cleo bore the brunt of their hostility. After that, Cleo had been a lot pickier about whom she spoke to at work. Luckily there were a number of other people who didn\u2019t give the rumors any credence. People like Florence, the lovely tea lady; Solomon, the cheerful company driver; Dante\u2019s personal protection guys; and some of the junior staff members who didn\u2019t get saddled with her extra work. Despite the short time she\u2019d been working there, she had no shortage of new friends.</p> <p>But the irony was that Cleo hadn\u2019t for even a second realized the Dante Damaso of Damaso International, Inc., was the same \u201cDan\u201d whose name Luc casually dropped into conversation on occasion. Luc and Dante had met in college and had become friends but were hardly the type of guys to invite each other to family gatherings, so Cleo had never had the opportunity to meet the man. She had also been way too involved with her own life and her dancing\u2014too wrapped up in herself\u2014to care about Lucius and his boring friends. So it had come as a shock to learn Luc\u2019s \u201cDan\u201d was the Dante Damaso of the renowned Damaso International chain of five-star hotels and resorts.</p><p>Only after Luc had gone all stern and disapproving big brother on her for using his relationship with Dante to get a job, did the penny drop. That\u2019s when she\u2019d understood that she\u2019d probably gotten the job because she was Luc\u2019s sister. A favor neither Luc nor Cleo had actually asked for. By that time it had been too late to back out, and Cleo had been determined to make the best of the chance she\u2019d been given. Of course, if she had actually met Dante Damaso during the interview process, she may very well have told him to shove his job. But his minions had conducted the recorded interviews, and Dante had\u2014supposedly\u2014made his decision after watching the recordings.</p><p>Cleo didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d expected of Dante Damaso, but from the very first day he had made it clear he merely suffered her presence, and just half an hour into her first day\u2014after asking her to make him a cup of coffee, photocopy some documents, send two e-mails (one of which she had messed up by leaving off a zero in a seriously huge number), and water his frickin\u2019 ficus\u2014he had sent her downstairs to a junior executive. Once there, the junior exec\u2019s assistant had patronizingly ushered Cleo to a desk and instructed her to answer the phone if it rang, before the woman checked her makeup and swanned off with a breezy \u201cMr. Damaso needs me to assist him today.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The memory still made Cleo seethe\u2014four months later\u2014and she clenched her teeth when she thought of how consistently after that first encounter the same thing had happened. She began every day in Damaso\u2019s office suite, and after half an hour\u2014during which she had the dubious privilege of making his coffee and watering that stupid ficus, or sometimes sending one of those loathsome little \u201cThanks for the sex\u201d notes\u2014she got shipped off to a different exec. Luckily the other executives had stopped giving her mundane tasks to do, and she\u2019d started enjoying her daily little soirees away from the boss\u2019s office. Still, the half hours in the mornings had become almost unbearable. Dante was scathing, brutally frank in his dismissal of her skills, and almost unbearably rude. He never greeted her, never used common courtesies like \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you\u201d when he spoke with her, and Cleo was convinced a smile would crack his perfect face.</p><p>Dante was still grimly focused on his iPad, and Cleo went back to greedily watching the passing scenery, trying to commit as much of it to memory as she could while longing to be out there exploring the wonderful mix of old and new. She loved the wooden buildings that looked as if they\u2019d been around since the Middle Ages, tucked away down alleys and overshadowed by aggressively modern monolithic skyscrapers. Nothing escaped her attention, and she tried to file away the interesting bits, wanting to research and read up on buildings, museums, and shops that captured her interest. All of which helped keep her mind off Dante\u2019s disturbing presence.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>Praise Jesus! They had doughnuts! Cleo barely noticed all the bowing and talking around her as her senses homed in on that single, all-important fact. By now she was so hungry she actually felt faint, and if she could only get her hands on one of those gorgeous hoops of sugary goodness, all would be right with her world. She nodded dazedly at the half circle of somber-looking businessmen in dark suits bowing to her and was barely aware of the tall, dark presence looming beside her as her eyes drifted again and again to the tempting display of coffee and pastries set up over to the side.</p> <p>The painfully prolonged polite greetings finally over, she stealthily drifted over to the table of goodies. She was just a finger\u2019s length away from a chocolate-glazed precious with her name written all over it when a firm hand clamped down on her elbow. Her empty stomach sank to the bottom of her sensible shoes, and she stared up at her boss with what she knew was the most effectively pathetic hangdog expression in her arsenal. But he was having none of it; his jaw was clenched so tightly she was amazed his teeth didn\u2019t crack. She gave one final forlorn look at the doughnuts before he led her to the long conference table in the center of the room.</p><p>\u201cTry to pay attention,\u201d he muttered in her ear as he planted her into a seat that, cruelly, faced the delicious spread just a table\u2019s breadth away from her.</p><p>What followed was the longest, most boring and torturous three hours of Cleo\u2019s life. The meeting was conducted entirely in Japanese, which Cleo didn\u2019t speak but Dante most certainly did, and quite fluently too from what she could tell. She didn\u2019t know why she was there. He had a Dictaphone recording the meeting, so even if she\u2019d been able to understand what was going on, she wouldn\u2019t have had to take notes anyway. All she could do was stare at the doughnuts and other delicious goodies in front of her and imagine how they tasted. At one point a fly landed on her doughnut. It took everything she had not to jump up with a primal scream and chase it away. Instead, she watched in revulsion as it crawled over every inch of her beautiful doughnut. She nearly sobbed in disappointment, gave up on the chocolate one, and shifted her attention to a gorgeous \u00e9clair on a different platter. But when that bastard fly, which she had now named Damaso Jr., landed on her \u00e9clair as well, she slumped back in her chair and stared glumly down at the blank notebook in front of her.</p><p>She picked up her pen and started scribbling. Hoping to at least look busy, she composed truly awful haiku and observations about the people seated around the table.</p><p>Her attempt at describing Dante:</p> <p>Hard of abs he is</p><p>Beautiful to look at sure</p><p>My God what a dick</p><p>Okay, maybe that last line was a little ambiguous. Was it an insult or a compliment? Even Cleo wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>After several even worse attempts, Cleo gave up on the haiku. She segued into doodling, occasionally looking up and nodding to make it seem like she was listening to every incomprehensible word being spoken. She glanced over at Dante and was delighted to note that he\u2019d perched his dark-rimmed spectacles on the tip of his nose. She\u2019d seen them before, of course, but loved how truly nerdy they made him look. Sexy-nerdy, but it was a flaw and she\u2019d take it.</p><p>The only other woman present, Ms. Inokawa, also slanted surreptitious glances at Dante and smiled demurely every time he spoke with her. If not for the calculating gleam in her pretty eyes, Cleo would have thought the woman sweet and slightly shy, but beneath all that saccharine sweetness beat the heart of a scheming seductress. And she had her sights on Dante.</p> <p>Well, she was welcome to him. All Cleo wanted was a doughnut. Maybe that caramel one, it looked like the fly had skipped\u2014damn it. Sure enough, as if drawn to it by her thoughts, the fly landed on that one too. By the time the meeting was over, the damned thing would have\u2014</p><p>\u201cMiss Knight?\u201d She jerked upright, realizing Dante had been trying to get her attention.</p><p>\u201cUh . . . yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked if you got that?\u201d</p><p>That? What? Wait, had they finally said something in English and she\u2019d missed it? Damn it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes. Yes, I did.\u201d She tapped the page of her open notebook as if to confirm her words, and when his eyes followed the movement, she hastily closed the book, not wanting him to see her scribbles. His brow lifted and his head tilted as his eyes burned into hers, and she smiled breezily up at him. She\u2019d just check his Dictaphone later to figure out what it was she\u2019d missed. No problem.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he asked. Crap. Now what?</p><p>\u201cYes, I got it,\u201d she repeated slowly, as if to an inattentive child. His eyes narrowed dangerously. God, he was scary when he did that. Okay, so maybe this was something he wanted done right away. That wasn\u2019t good at all. She\u2019d have to cop to the truth. She leaned in toward him and was a little offended when he leaned in the opposite direction.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t quite get the last bit,\u201d she confessed, and his eyes flared with what looked like disgust. How was she supposed to know they\u2019d suddenly switch to English? Okay, so she should probably have been paying closer attention, but after three hours of nothing but Japanese, she was bound to have zoned out at some point.</p> <p>\u201cI want you to arrange a meeting with Craig, Josh, Ryan, Tanaka-san, Inokawa-san, Watanabe-san, and myself for three thirty this afternoon.\u201d Cleo ducked her head as she quickly scribbled the information on a blank sheet in her notebook.</p><p>\u201cYou may use this conference room for the meeting, Knight-san,\u201d Ms. Inokawa said in her breathy little voice, shocking the hell out of Cleo with her English. Could they all speak English? If so, how rude of them to not once acknowledge her lack of Japanese. Then again, she was just the assistant, who couldn\u2019t even do the only thing that had been required of her at this meeting efficiently.</p><p>The meeting was apparently adjourned, because the men bowed and shook hands, Ms. Inokawa was speaking in that charmingly girlish voice, all the while smiling sweetly, while Cleo was left to her own devices, alone at the table. She got up\u2014ostensibly to stretch\u2014and finally made her way over to the fly-tainted, stale-looking pastries.</p><p>\u201cKnight, get on those phone calls,\u201d Dante growled from the other end of the room. Cleo swallowed down her resentment before fishing out the company phone to contact the architect, the contractor, and Ryan Blake\u2014the company\u2019s legal representative\u2014all of whom were staying at the same hotel as Cleo and Dante. After a series of meetings with the three men the previous day, the boss had wanted to meet with the Japanese alone this morning in order to straighten out the mess he believed the other men had created. So if he was calling them back in, it must mean he\u2019d made some headway in that morning\u2019s meeting.</p><p>The speed at which they all answered their phones attested to the fact that they\u2019d probably been anxiously awaiting her call, and Cleo set up the meeting within minutes. Dante was still amicably chatting with the Japanese trio, but the moment she disconnected the second call, he looked at her with a raised brow. She nodded in response to the question she could see in his eyes, and he went back to his conversation without acknowledging her affirmation. Stifling her irritation at his rudeness, she started compiling a list of all the documentation they would need for the second meeting. She was well engrossed in that task when Dante\u2019s voice, coming from directly behind her, startled her back into the present.</p> <p>\u201cAre you coming? Inokawa-san has arranged lunch for us,\u201d he informed her, and Cleo bit back a groan of relief. She jumped up quickly before he could revoke the invitation, and swayed slightly as the lack of food and jet lag hit her. His hand caught her elbow and steadied her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you?\u201d he hissed.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t eaten much of anything since the in-flight meal yesterday morning,\u201d she hissed back. \u201cSo excuse me for feeling a little light-headed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. You had dinner last night and breakfast this morning.\u201d He waved his hand dismissively, refuting her claims with innate arrogance.</p><p>\u201cNo, you had dinner and breakfast. You told me we\u2019d have a dinner meeting and ordered only enough for yourself, and if you consider that one piece of bacon and mouthful of eggs I gobbled down this morning breakfast, then you and I have seriously different ideas of what constitutes a healthy meal.\u201d</p><p>His brow lowered as he considered her words; then he tilted his head toward the pastries on the nearby table.</p> <p>\u201cAnd this is why you\u2019ve been staring at that table like an addict eyeing her next fix?\u201d Okay, is that a glint of laughter in his normally enigmatic gaze? That was . . . different.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d she said flatly, unamused by his amusement.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll remedy that immediately,\u201d he assured her, squeezing her elbow briefly before letting her go completely.</p><p>Cleo tried not to cry while she stared down at the minuscule serving of sushi in front of her. Ms. Inokawa had reserved a trendy sushi restaurant for lunch, and though Cleo wasn\u2019t a huge fan of Japanese food, she\u2019d eat it if she was desperate enough. However, she hadn\u2019t been expecting a child-size portion of food. She wasn\u2019t the biggest of women\u2014dancing kept her lean, and her frame was ideally petite for a dancer\u2014but she had a healthy appetite, and the prettily decorated plate in front of her barely contained enough food to feed a gnat.</p><p>She was about to dig in when a hand clamped down on her thigh and squeezed painfully. Her shocked gaze flew to Dante\u2019s impassive face, and he turned his head to glare at her before nodding toward Mr. Watanabe, who was speaking. She belatedly recalled the cultural etiquette booklet she had speedily read through on the plane, and remembered eating or drinking before your hosts was considered extremely rude. Apparently Mr. Watanabe was going to ramble on for a while before giving the go-ahead to eat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stared at her sushi glumly and took solace in the fact that at least it wouldn\u2019t get cold, and her little friend Damaso Jr. was probably still back in that stuffy boardroom gorging himself on stale doughnuts and \u00e9clairs and therefore unable to ruin this meal for her. Mr. Watanabe finally stopped talking, and everybody picked up his or her chopsticks and proceeded to eat with great gusto.</p><p>\u201cDamaso-san, you use chopsticks very proficiently,\u201d Cleo heard Ms. Inokawa, seated on Dante\u2019s left, say in her breathy voice. Seriously? Like the man wasn\u2019t arrogant enough, she was going to stare at him with those big brown eyes and fawn over him because he could use chopsticks? He modestly thanked her for her compliment, and Cleo choked down her sushi, trying very hard not to be sick.</p><p>A few minutes later she nearly was sick when she stared in horror at the plate of sashimi that had just been placed in front of her. Her hand fluttered to her mouth as she swallowed back her nausea.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d Dante warned, leaning toward her and keeping a pleasant smile on his face to disguise the warning.</p> <p>\u201cBut they\u2019re alive,\u201d she practically wept in reply. The sashimi shrimp on her plate were writhing weakly and had quite effectively killed her previously ravenous appetite.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like odori ebi, Knight-san?\u201d Mr. Tanaka, who had been chatting shyly with her in broken English, noticed her reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s very fresh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fresh,\u201d she said from behind her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Mr. Tanaka nodded, smiling encouragingly as he made an eager go-ahead gesture with his hands. \u201cFresh. Taste. Taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think . . .\u201d She was on the verge of tears, horrified at the thought of the shrimp dying in her mouth. It was hypocritical, sure, but if they\u2019d died even just seconds before being served to her, she would happily have eaten them. But the thought of them dying between her teeth or on her tongue or as they slid down her throat totally grossed her out. She turned pleading eyes on Dante, whose face was completely expressionless. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He turned to their companions, said something in Japanese, and they all roared with laughter.</p><p>\u201cOh, Damaso-san, you are so funny,\u201d Ms. Inokawa chortled.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Hilarious,\u201d Cleo muttered beneath her breath. A slanted glance from him confirmed that he\u2019d heard her. She directed another distressed look down at her plate, and a pair of chopsticks swooped into her line of vision and grabbed one of the poor creatures.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Miss Knight, I\u2019ll save you from these creepy crustaceans,\u201d he mocked, before dipping the poor thing in soy sauce, hopefully drowning it, and popping it into his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re just prolonging their suffering by letting them writhe like that.\u201d</p><p>She was ridiculously grateful to him for handling the situation even though he had made her the butt of the joke to do so. The incident was soon forgotten, but as the dishes grew progressively more unappetizing\u2014gah! sea urchin\u2014her queasiness and exhaustion made her feel more ill with every passing moment. Lunch stretched on for ages, and when it finally ended, Cleo, who had barely touched a morsel, had a huge headache and felt a little punch-drunk.</p><p>\u201cMiss Knight, contact the driver and head back to the hotel to draft those e-mails we discussed earlier,\u201d Dante said as the group got up from the booth. She stared up at him blankly, wondering what she\u2019d missed this time. He waved the other three ahead of them, and Cleo tried to focus on his face and what he was saying, which was difficult when she felt like a zombie.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t recall the e-mails you\u2019re referring to,\u201d she said, hating to reinforce his already low opinion of her.</p><p>\u201cThere are no e-mails, Knight. Go back to the hotel, take a shower, order room service, and get some sleep. The jet lag, combined with the busy evening and\u201d\u2014his eyes darkened and his voice lowered sexily\u2014\u201cexhausting night you had yesterday, has taken a toll on you. Rest up. I need you to be more alert tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Oh, thank God.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d she whispered, for once feeling something akin to affection and gratitude toward the man.</p><p>\u201cGo on now, Knight,\u201d he said, the words brusque and the tone businesslike. \u201cBefore I change my mind.\u201d</p><p>She resisted the impish urge to salute, and after he\u2019d followed the other three people out onto the humid, bustling sidewalk, she got out her cell phone to contact the driver.</p><p>Half an hour later, she was back in the air-conditioned splendor of the car and happily chatting with the driver, Daisuke. He spoke fluent English and very sweetly pointed out a few of the interesting sights to her, giving her a brief history lesson while he was at it. Cleo was disappointed when they arrived back at the hotel. She was tempted to venture out on her own, since she had this unexpected free time, but hunger and exhaustion had really taken their toll on her, and by the time she got back to her room, she was dragging so badly that eating didn\u2019t even occur to her. She discarded her clothes on her way to the bed and fell facedown onto the covers. She was asleep seconds later.</p><p>\u201cMiss Knight?\u201d The regrettably familiar masculine voice resonated through Cleo\u2019s pleasant dream. She frowned and turned away from it, happily rejoining the cotton-candy sheep she\u2019d been frolicking with just moments before. The sheep were cute, friendly, and delicious . . . she took a bite out of a particularly friendly fellow\u2019s sugary-pink fleece and relished the sweetness. The sheep baaed and\u2014\u201cMiss Knight!\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSheep can\u2019t talk,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d the voice asked impatiently. Cleo sighed and reluctantly opened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh. It\u2019s you,\u201d she groused when she met her boss\u2019s intense gaze. She blew her hair out of her face and pushed herself up, only to realize she was wearing just a pair of panties and no bra and didn\u2019t have so much as a sheet covering her. She squeaked and grabbed a pillow to cover her front. She scampered back against the headboard and pulled her knees up to her chest, sandwiching the pillow between her lap and torso. She glared at Dante, who stared back at her impassively from his position at the foot of her bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen it all in exquisite detail before,\u201d he reminded her, and she blushed.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in my room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe concierge told me you didn\u2019t order any room service, and Daisuke informed me that you didn\u2019t stop for food en route to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d she asked belligerently, despite the fact that his words brought her hunger screaming painfully back.</p><p>\u201cI ordered you a late dinner. I figured you might want to freshen up or something before it got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA late dinner?\u201d she repeated, trying hard not to be charmed by that sweet gesture. It was the least he could do, after all, since he was the reason she was starving in the first place. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust after midnight. I got in about half an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe meeting ran that late?\u201d she asked, surprised.</p><p>\u201cNo, but we got a lot done, and the Japanese wanted to celebrate with a night on the town followed by some . . .\u201d He grimaced and then shook his head. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>Intrigued by the slight flush darkening his cheekbones, she leaned forward, forgetting momentarily that only a pillow shielded her from his view.</p><p>\u201cFollowed by some what?\u201d She pictured strip clubs or those hostess bars she\u2019d read up on, maybe something even kinkier. What else could make him look so uncomfortable?</p><p>\u201cNothing. It\u2019s none of your business,\u201d he dismissed rudely, but sitting there nearly completely nude, groggy from hours of sleep, and with the room only half-lit, Cleo lost all inhibition and sense of self-preservation and refused to heed the warning in his voice.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be that bad. I mean, everybody knows about the hostess bars and stuff over here. Was it something like that? Did you have some pretty young thing sitting on your lap all evening telling you how handsome and strong you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to pay a woman to tell me I\u2019m handsome and strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, I\u2019m sure Ms. Inokawa was happy to do that for you,\u201d she said snidely.</p><p>\u201cJealous, Knight?\u201d</p><p>She laughed incredulously at the question and waved a hand, the pillow slipping dangerously low.</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re having a bit of a\u2014how do you say this?\u2014wardrobe malfunction?\u201d</p><p>She gasped when a quick look down confirmed one of her nipples was indeed peeking up above the pillow. She hastily adjusted before looking back up to meet his avid gaze.</p> <p>\u201cStop staring at me like that,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you\u2019re hoping it\u2019ll happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am hoping it\u2019ll happen again.\u201d She gasped again, sounding, even to herself, like some outraged Victorian maiden.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a highly inappropriate thing to say,\u201d she pointed out, and he covered his mouth with his fist and coughed slightly, making her wonder if he was hiding a laugh behind the cough.</p><p>\u201cAnd me standing here in your bedroom while you lounge around in only your panties isn\u2019t inappropriate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are levels of inappropriate behavior,\u201d she informed him primly, not even sure herself what the hell she was talking about. How could she be rattling on about appropriate behavior after everything they\u2019d done the night before?</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d He sat down at the foot of her bed. \u201cPlease do educate me. Sitting on your bed, how inappropriate is this? On a scale of one to ten? Ten being highly inappropriate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Five . . . maybe?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I moved a little closer?\u201d He shifted up until his butt rested beside her feet.</p><p>\u201cFive and a half.\u201d The words were barely audible, but he nodded before running the back of his large hand over her feet, then her slender shins, before turning his hand over so his palm did the downward stroke back to her feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat about that?\u201d he rasped as his breathing got a little heavier. He cupped her small feet in his hand, his thumb caressing the instep of the top foot. She fought to gather her scattered thoughts so she could respond.</p><p>\u201cSix and a half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA full point up?\u201d he mused. \u201cImpressive.\u201d</p><p>He shifted even closer, and before she knew it, he tugged the pillow away, leaving her without the precious barrier. She yelped in protest, but he paid her no heed, and Cleo\u2019s heart slammed into her rib cage as he slid his broad chest into the space that had just been occupied by the pillow. And he was nowhere near as soft and comfortable. He was hard and hot and smelled much too good. Suddenly all Cleo could think about was last night and how fantastic he had felt above her, inside her, all around her . . . and all she wanted was more of the same.</p><p>He dropped his head and nuzzled the sensitive spot on her neck, just below her ear, his lips grazing against the rapid pulse there. He sucked lightly, then bit, and when she groaned, he licked away the sting.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like doing things by half measure,\u201d he muttered into her ear, his hot breath sending goose bumps careening across every inch of her skin and tightening her nipples painfully. \u201cI want a perfect score.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With that he lifted his head and planted a deep, hungry kiss on her lips, and Cleo happily opened up for him, drinking him in, wanting him desperately. Every hot, hard, sexy, arrogant, unlikeable part of him.</p><p>She whimpered, once again fighting with that reasonable part of her that kept trying to insert itself into her business. She dragged her lips from his, a little shocked she could get this turned on from just one kiss.</p><p>\u201cI thought we weren\u2019t going to do this again,\u201d she whispered, and for a moment, while he continued to nuzzle and suck on her neck, she thought he hadn\u2019t heard her.</p><p>\u201cBut that would be a waste of some perfectly good sex, dulzura.\u201d He ran his large hand down her naked back as he said the words, and Cleo found herself purring like a kitten in response to the caress.</p><p>\u201cIt was pretty good, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d She hummed, doing a bit of her own nuzzling. She loved the feel of his expensive silk shirt against her pebbled breasts and lost all inhibition, blatantly rubbing them against his chest, wanting him to start focusing on the important stuff now. He complied, shifting until she was flat on her back and he was sitting on the side of the bed, with the upper half of his body bent over hers. His hot gaze traveled from her face down to her breasts, and with a shaky groan he lifted his hands to cup and caress the pretty little mounds. He plumped one up to receive his mouth, and when he tugged at the aching nipple with his lips, Cleo nearly came out of her skin. She\u2019d always had unbearably sensitive breasts, which Dante hadn\u2019t paid much attention to the night before but seemed to be taking great delight in now.</p><p>\u201cCan you come from just this?\u201d he asked huskily. \u201cFrom someone playing with your breasts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t yet,\u201d she managed to wheeze out, and he gave her a rakish little smirk.</p><p>\u201cAh. Another challenge,\u201d he said, before bending back down to her breasts. \u201cWell, dulzura, allow me . . .\u201d</p><p>More than an hour later, Cleo lay on her back, chest still heaving, body still shuddering, and an arm draped across her eyes to block out her embarrassment at how completely uninhibited she had been with the man snoring gently beside her. She could now check the whole \u201corgasming from just breast play\u201d thing off her bucket list. He had certainly risen to the challenge there. He hadn\u2019t cheated once, no sneaky hands drifting south, and when she\u2019d attempted to hasten things along with her own hands, he had firmly moved them back up to his chest.</p><p>After all that delicious foreplay, she had been more than ready for him to move on to the main event, but nope, he had made it his duty to find as many of her erogenous zones as possible before finally claiming her body. As before, once he finished, he simply rolled off her and fell asleep. This time in her bed, which was a little annoying and meant she would have to retreat to the spare room. She got up and tugged on the huge, white fluffy robe the hotel provided and padded toward the door. She didn\u2019t really know what the protocol was in this situation, but knew he wasn\u2019t the type to sleep through the night with a woman.</p><p>She threw a resentful look back at the inconsiderate ass sprawled across her bed and then sighed a little at what a fine ass he actually had. He lay in absolute naked magnificence, facedown, one leg bent at the knee and the other straight. His arms were up above his head, and his face was buried in a marshmallowy pillow. As she watched, he turned his head toward her so he could breathe easier. She paused, riveted by how vulnerable he looked in his sleep, how much younger.</p><p>She reluctantly admitted to herself that he was a remarkable man. To take his family\u2019s ailing hotel brand and turn it into this multi-billion-dollar corporation in less than ten years was an almost unheard of feat. He was only thirty-three, and to achieve so much at such a young age, he would have had to be ruthless and cutthroat.</p><p>\u201cPlay hard, work harder\u201d was his motto, or at least that\u2019s what the newspapers and tabloids often quoted him as saying. Even if she wanted more from him, Cleo knew she didn\u2019t stand a chance of being much more than a lay to this powerful, handsome man. But that was fine; she didn\u2019t want more from him since he was nothing more than a fantastic lay to her. As long as they both understood that, everything would be fine.</p><p>She turned away from him and slipped into the huge, elegantly furnished living room that spanned the distance between their rooms. Her eyes immediately fell on the service cart standing in the middle of the floor. She moaned, her appetite roaring to life with such ferocity that she almost swayed with hunger. She lifted the domed lids off each dish and almost cried at the congealed mess that was all that remained of what had once been a beautiful dinner. She padded over to one of the ornate sideboards and reached for the telephone to call room service and order another meal.</p><p>It was nearly one thirty, and she felt invigorated after all that glorious sex\u2014not tired in the least\u2014and as she stood at the floor-to-ceiling window and stared down at the sparkling city lights below, she wondered what adventures were to be had out there. A reckless desire to go exploring surged to life and she tamped it down, knowing that wandering around in a huge city like this on her own, in the middle of the night, would be stupid. She sank into one of the massive Bakokko armchairs angled toward the window and folded her legs up in front of her, wrapping her arms around them and resting her chin on her knees.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in here?\u201d A few minutes later, Dante\u2019s sleep-roughened voice startled her, and she squeaked slightly before turning her head to watch him enter the room.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were the type of guy who liked to wake up next to the night\u2019s casual shag, so I retreated. Since you were passed out in my room, I thought I\u2019d take the spare room tonight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStill doesn\u2019t tell me why you\u2019re in here,\u201d he pointed out, a sweeping arm indicating that he meant the living room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting for room service,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you dare distract me again! I can\u2019t go much longer without food.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked and he sat down in one of the other chairs, angling his body toward her. She averted her eyes when she comprehended that he was still naked. How had she not noticed that immediately?</p><p>\u201cDo you mind covering up?\u201d she asked, not as comfortable with his nudity as he clearly was.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Is it inappropriate for me to walk around like this?\u201d he asked, and she clenched her teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou know it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut after last night and what we just did in the other room, I think we have probably gone way off the scale by now. This can\u2019t be much more than a four, surely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing this game with you again,\u201d she gritted out. \u201cJust put on some clothes before room service gets here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this is about room service, I think you find me . . . irresistible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet over yourself,\u201d she muttered, hating that damned smug look on his face.</p><p>He yanked one of the chair cushions out from behind his back and placed it neatly over his crotch, folding his hands over the top of the embroidered pillow.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He challenged at her dubious look. \u201cThis worked for you earlier.\u201d</p><p>It hadn\u2019t really worked that well, considering the events that followed, but Cleo wasn\u2019t about to bring that up now.</p><p>The doorbell chimed and she jumped up, grateful for the distrac-tion. She could have hugged the waiter when he pushed the cart into the room.</p><p>\u201cTip him,\u201d she ordered Dante, already lifting the lids off the bowls and dishes, her knees almost buckling at the divine smells.</p><p>\u201cBossy little thing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he murmured directly into her ear as he came to stand behind her, close enough for his body heat to penetrate the thickness of her robe. The waiter kept his eyes averted as Dante signed for the meal and added a generous tip. The waiter thanked them and beat a hasty retreat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re naked again, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Cleo asked without turning her head. He didn\u2019t respond immediately. Instead, his hands dropped to her shoulders and kneaded gently. He was pressed to her body, and his growing erection started to make its presence known against her back, even through the thickness of the robe.</p><p>\u201cNot naked again,\u201d he denied. \u201cMore like . . . still.\u201d</p><p>His lips dropped to her earlobe and he sucked it into his mouth, giving it a little nip in the process. Cleo moaned, and as he ground his substantial erection against her, she pushed back until he groaned appreciatively. His hand reached around and slid into the front of her robe, finding her breast with unerring accuracy. Cleo allowed him a squeeze before looking down at the food in front of her and stepping away from him.</p><p>She turned around to face him and dropped a quick glance down at his huge, straining penis, which had her salivating for a completely different reason.</p><p>\u201cPut that thing away,\u201d she said softly, nodding down at it decisively. \u201cYou and your insatiable penis will not be distracting me from my food this time.\u201d</p><p>He turned away from her and she could have sworn she heard a chuckle, which just about melted her heart because Dante Damaso was not prone to humor.</p><p>\u201cEat your food, florecita; you\u2019ll need the energy for later.\u201d</p> <p>He really was a cocky sonofabitch. But Cleo was beyond caring about that right now, and she carried her food\u2014a salad, penne carbonara, and cheesecake for dessert\u2014over to the expensive-looking coffee table in front of her chair by the window. Dante followed her and sat down, with his pillow thankfully shielding his impressive package from her again. His eyes were intent as he watched her eat, and after satisfying her immediate hunger by scarfing down the first half of her meal with great gusto, Cleo grew more and more self-conscious beneath that relentless gaze.</p><p>\u201cPlease stop staring at me,\u201d she finally said around a mouthful of penne.</p><p>\u201cI like looking at you.\u201d Well, that was completely out of left field. She felt her mouth gaping, knowing that with the half-masticated pasta in there, she probably looked like a drooling idiot. She recovered quickly and shut her mouth, barely bothering to chew the rest of the mouthful before swallowing.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like looking at you,\u201d he repeated. \u201cYou\u2019re interesting.\u201d</p><p>Well, at least he hadn\u2019t lied and called her pretty. She knew she had a weird face. For one thing, her lips were too big in a too-narrow face. Her schoolmates had nastily called her \u201cJuicy Lips\u201d throughout primary school, and in high school the boys had started making all kinds of offensive suggestions about the things she should be doing with those \u201cjuicy lips.\u201d Then there was her crooked nose, broken when she\u2019d fallen during a dance rehearsal years ago. It wasn\u2019t horrendous, and after the surgery to fix the damage had failed, Cleo resigned herself to accepting her slightly off-center nose. And finally there were her ridiculously big green eyes, which had people likening her to a baby doll for most of her life. Cleo hated her bug eyes; she thought they made her look continually surprised.</p><p>Her ridiculous face, combined with the petite body, often led people to underestimate her. That had been an asset while she was pursuing her dance career; she had wanted to be underestimated before \u201cwowing\u201d her competitors and choreographers with her talent. Choreographers and directors loved that unexpected quality about her, had raved about her \u201cfreshness\u201d and her \u201cquirkiness.\u201d But now, in the real world, being underestimated led to fewer opportunities and greater frustrations. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in that head of yours?\u201d Dante\u2019s voice intruded upon her troubling thoughts, and she focused her attention back on him.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking . . .\u201d She cleared her throat before affecting a cocky grin and reaching for her dessert. \u201cI was thinking you still haven\u2019t told me what you did after dinner tonight. Did you go to one of those onsen places?\u201d She was referring to the public hot spas that were so popular in Japan. \u201cDid you have to get naked with Mr. Tanaka and Mr. Watanabe?\u201d</p><p>He winced at the question.</p><p>\u201cDios, no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen it really can\u2019t be that bad, can it?\u201d She enjoyed needling him; his embarrassment made him seem a little more approachable. \u201cAnything my imagination dredges up will probably be a lot worse than reality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe went to karaoke,\u201d he said, finally relenting, and Cleo choked on her first bite of cheesecake.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being overly dramatic,\u201d he scoffed as she waved her hand in front of her face to cool her skin after her coughing fit.</p><p>\u201cKaraoke?\u201d she finally managed on a wheeze, and he nodded. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Can I have some of that cheesecake?\u201d he asked casually.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied equally casually, deliberately sticking another forkful in her mouth and chewing slowly before asking her next question. \u201cDid you actually sing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed.\u201d His eyes dropped to the remaining cheesecake on her plate. \u201cJust a bite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said as she took another teasing forkful. \u201cWhat did you sing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit of Queen, some Rolling Stones, a little Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Blondie . . .\u201d he recited. \u201cYou don\u2019t seriously mean to eat that entire piece of cake, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she affirmed. \u201cBlondie? Seriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Cyndi Lauper.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cMs. Inokawa really likes their songs but can\u2019t sing them because the English is a bit too fast-paced for her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut they\u2019re so high-pitched.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>\u201cI know. Can we stop talking about this now? And I warn you, this remains between us. Now give me some of that cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s my cake. Get your own dessert!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, what are you doing?\u201d she asked seconds later when he knelt in front of her chair and ran his hands from her knees to her thighs, parting her robe as he did so. She hurriedly put her cake aside as she stared down at him in shock.</p><p>\u201cGetting my dessert,\u201d he mumbled, moving his hands beneath her butt and dragging her to the edge of the chair until he had her spread wide open in front of him. The corners of his lips quirked upward before he hummed in contentment, bent his head, and feasted.</p><p>Cleo, her own dessert forgotten, stared down at the top of his dark head in disbelief until his very talented tongue started to work its magic on her. She arched back in the chair and entangled her fingers in his hair as her eyes drifted shut.</p><p>\u201cOh. My God . . .\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>The rest of their time in Tokyo sped by. Dante didn\u2019t micromanage Cleo as much as before, solely because he didn\u2019t have the time to oversee her every little move. She did her work efficiently and gave him no cause for complaint.</p><p>Their nights were equally busy. They never spoke about it, never gave what was happening between them a name, but they spent every night together having mind-blowing sex. And when it was over, Cleo always retreated to her room, and Dante never made any attempt to call her back. And if she ever had any doubts as to the nature of their \u201crelationship,\u201d his indifference and distance during the day when he was focused on work certainly made things clear. He never, by word or by deed, let on that theirs was anything more than a working relationship. Yet he had a chocolate-glazed doughnut waiting for her at whatever conference room they happened to find themselves in on any given day, and he always ensured that her plate was full at lunchtime and that the menu would be palatable for her. When they headed back to the hotel in the evenings, Daisuke always took a different route so she got to see a bit of the city, which she suspected was Dante\u2019s doing as well. It was all so sweet, Cleo didn\u2019t know how to respond to it.</p><p>By their last day, the zoning problem had been completely ironed out, and everybody was in a celebratory mood. They would break ground on the new hotel in less than a month.</p><p>\u201cTonight, we will have an enkai to celebrate this wonderful occasion,\u201d Ms. Inokawa stated happily. \u201cThis is a very formal Japanese event, so there will be many speeches, but after that we will all enjoy drinking together and have many after-parties.\u201d</p><p>Her pretty eyes slid to Dante in clear invitation, and Cleo pretended not to see the smile he slanted the woman in return. Of course she wasn\u2019t jealous. Dante Damaso meant nothing to her. Just a bit of fun. A casual fling.</p><p>So that evening as they were preparing to leave the hotel, Cleo suggested she stay behind. After all, she told herself magnanimously, he might feel a bit awkward flirting with Ms. Inokawa while Cleo was hanging about.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not staying behind. You\u2019ve read enough of those etiquette books to know that it\u2019s damned bad manners,\u201d he snapped. He\u2019d been in a pretty foul mood most of the day, despite the news that his new hotel had gotten the green light.</p><p>Cleo sighed and checked her appearance in the mirror one final time. She was wearing yet another variation of the same boring skirt, jacket, and blouse combo that she had rocked the entire week. She truly hated her work wardrobe; it wasn\u2019t at all to her taste. She was more at home in torn jeans and T-shirts, or slip dresses with long bohemian skirts, than in these horrendous suits that made her feel like a trussed-up pigeon. She didn\u2019t know who she was when she wore these clothes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Because this was a work-related enkai, everyone would be dressed in business suits. Dante looked his usual dashing self in a three-piece, pin-striped, navy-blue, bespoke Desmond Merrion suit with a white shirt, red tie, and Tanino Crisci Lilian shoes, all of which she knew were ridiculously expensive because she had seen his personal bills. The man looked gorgeous and smelled luxurious. Cleo, on the other hand, just felt frumpy in her department-store knockoff gray pencil skirt, matching blazer, and pink cotton blouse. Ugh, and the sensible black pumps she was wearing were completely hideous too.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Dante ushered her out of the suite and to the elevator, and Cleo tried to drum up some enthusiasm for the event. At least she would get to see someplace other than a boring conference room in a bleak building.</p><p>\u201cI hope the food\u2019s good,\u201d she said once they were in the elevator. He stood beside her, close enough for her to feel his body heat without physically touching him. His hands were clasped in front of him, and his feet were braced shoulder-width apart. He looked like a soldier ready for battle.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he merely grunted, and she raised her eyebrows. So it was going to be like that, was it?</p> <p>Right, then.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say another word until they were seated in the car. Daisuke greeted them enthusiastically, like he hadn\u2019t seen them just hours before, and Cleo smiled warmly at him before continuing the fascinating conversation about Japanese pop culture that they\u2019d been having earlier. He was entertaining and genuinely funny, and it wasn\u2019t long before Cleo was laughing at some of his anecdotes.</p><p>\u201cMy girlfriend loves purikura, and she has many hundreds of tiny pictures of herself and her friends.\u201d He told Cleo about something called \u201cprint club\u201d\u2014specialized photo booths found in most malls\u2014that took tiny airbrushed pictures, which could be Photoshopped before being printed.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any pictures, Dai?\u201d Cleo asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cI only go to purikura with Miki,\u201d he explained. Miki was his girlfriend. He flipped down the sun visor and retrieved the pictures he had stashed behind the mirror. He handed them back to her, and Cleo exclaimed in delight over the colorful, brightly decorated little photographs of Daisuke and a pretty girl. She turned toward Dante to share the images with him, but he was staring out the window, ignoring them, his jaw tightly clenched as he glared at the passing scenery. Her smile slipped a little as she stared at the back of his head, wondering what was going on with him.</p> <p>She handed the pictures back to Daisuke.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re really cute. I wish I\u2019d had time to take a few myself.\u201d She could hear the wistful note in her voice and told herself to snap out of it. She was here for work, not vacation. \u201cMiki is really pretty, Dai. How long have you guys been dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo years.\u201d He beamed proudly. \u201cShe is studying to be a teacher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFabulous. What will she teach?\u201d He looked stumped for a moment as he considered her question.</p><p>\u201cUh . . . she will be a shodo no sensei. A penmanship teacher?\u201d He looked uncertain. \u201cShe will teach the art of Japanese writing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Cleo was not quite sure what he meant but didn\u2019t want to embarrass him.</p> <p>\u201cEvery stroke must be correct. It is almost artistic. Very difficult.\u201d He glanced around before pointing to an incomprehensible sign written in bold black Japanese. \u201cLike this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean like in cursive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Dante suddenly said beneath his breath. \u201cHe means Japanese calligraphy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she breathed, feeling like a complete idiot for not realizing that immediately.</p><p>\u201cYou know it?\u201d Daisuke asked eagerly, and Cleo nodded.</p><p>\u201cYes, I read about it. I should have known when you said artistic writing,\u201d she said apologetically.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. My English is very bad,\u201d he said with a diffident grin. That was such a staggering untruth that Cleo\u2019s mouth dropped open.</p><p>\u201cYour English is great, Daisuke,\u201d she said firmly, and he waved a hand in front of his face.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, very bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . it\u2019s not bad at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Thank you,\u201d he said so abruptly she blinked.</p><p>What?</p><p>The whole exchange left her feeling a little confused and flustered. She hoped she hadn\u2019t offended him by implying his English was bad.</p><p>\u201cLet it go, Knight,\u201d Dante muttered, clearly not as oblivious to their conversation as he had appeared to be earlier.</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Japanese way to be self-effacing. Just leave it.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, even though it went against every instinct she had to just comply with what could only be described as a command. She changed the subject, asking Dai a question about the relatively new Tokyo Sky Tree. It was obviously a subject he took great pride and passion in, and by the time they reached their destination five minutes later, Cleo knew exactly how tall the building was, how long it had taken to construct, how many men had worked on it, and how people from all over Japan flocked to come and visit the tallest tower in the world\u2014a point of pride for most Japanese people.</p><p>Cleo was still thinking about how much she would have loved to see the views from the observation deck of the Sky Tree while they were being ushered into the restaurant by Ms. Inokawa, who\u2019d been waiting for them at the entrance. Their party was being held in an extremely traditional Japanese room. It had straw mats called tatami on the floor, and rice paper\u2014or shoji\u2014doors and panels. The d\u00e9cor was very minimalist, featuring only one long, very low table in the center of the room, with flat cushions known as zabuton on the floor beside each place setting. There were no chairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cleo immediately felt intimidated by the room, not sure what would be expected of her and not wanting to offend in her ignorance.</p><p>\u201cKnight-san, please.\u201d Ms. Inokawa gestured toward a spot close to the end of the long table before she ushered Dante up to the pride of place, dead center of the table. She bowed, left him there on his own, and rejoined Cleo.</p><p>Other somber-suited people filed into the room, while Ms. Inokawa gestured for Cleo to sit down beside her. Wondering if there was any graceful way to sit on the floor in a tight skirt, Cleo clumsily sank down flat on her butt with her legs folded to the side.</p><p>\u201cKnight-san.\u201d Ms. Inokawa leaned over to whisper abashedly. \u201cBecause this is a formal party, we will sit in seiza.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this.\u201d Ms. Inokawa sat beside Cleo, folding herself up delicately on the way down. Cleo grimaced, already dreading what was to come because there was no way in hell she could sit like that. The other woman was on her knees with her legs folded beneath her thighs and her feet tucked neatly beneath her bum.</p><p>\u201cHow long will we have to sit like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is usually proper for women to sit this way for the entire party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? And the men?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey too will sit in seiza, but after a while they will probably cross their legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sit like that,\u201d Cleo whispered urgently. Ms. Inokawa\u2019s perfect brow furrowed ever so slightly, and she affected a lovely look of helpless distress. Dante, who could see everything from his central position on the opposite side of the table, got to his feet and ambled around to their end of the table.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem here?\u201d he asked, and Ms. Inokawa bowed gracefully before shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cThere is no problem, Damaso-san.\u201d Rather surprised that the other woman didn\u2019t rat her out, Cleo slanted her a shocked glance before meeting Dante\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sit like this.\u201d She gestured to where Ms. Inokawa sat like the perfect epitome of modesty and beauty.</p><p>\u201cEverybody will be sitting in seiza,\u201d Dante pointed out. Cleo nodded and tried very hard not to react to his impatience.</p> <p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard,\u201d she said. Dante sighed and glanced up as several important-looking men\u2014some of whom she\u2019d never seen before\u2014entered the room.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time for this, Knight. Stop playing childish and attention-seeking games and don\u2019t embarrass me,\u201d he growled, before striding away, leaving Cleo humiliated. She was absolutely\u2014and unexpectedly\u2014shattered that he had spoken to her like that in front of Ms. Inokawa, who was very discreetly keeping her gaze focused on her place setting. Cleo blinked hard when she realized that her eyes had actually gone misty, and she was annoyed with herself for letting him get to her. Still, after a week of sexing her up, surely he\u2019d noticed the extensive scarring on her right knee. Surely he\u2019d wondered about it. She knew every single detail of his body, every little imperfection\u2014of which there were few\u2014every nook and crevice, and he hadn\u2019t noticed the huge and ugly vertical scar on her knee? Well, wasn\u2019t that just a much-needed reality check for Cleo? She had to be careful around this man; she had to guard her heart, because while she had started to soften toward him, he hadn\u2019t ever seen her as more than a casual hookup.</p><p>\u201cWe can start in seiza,\u201d Ms. Inokawa leaned over to whisper conspiratorially, \u201cbut after everybody has had a few drinks, no one will notice if we move our legs to the side and sit on our behinds.\u201d</p><p>Surprised by the sympathy and camaraderie in the other woman\u2019s voice, Cleo looked up and saw genuine warmth in her eyes. Great. As if the whole situation with Dante wasn\u2019t bad enough, she\u2019d gone and completely misjudged Ms. Inokawa as well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d she said with a watery smile. \u201cI have a bad knee. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019ll hold up if I were to sit like that for too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Ms. Inokawa said with a swift pat on Cleo\u2019s hand. \u201cIt won\u2019t be long before the beers start to take effect.\u201d</p><p>Cleo giggled when the other woman winked dramatically, and started to think that maybe this entire evening wouldn\u2019t be too much of an ordeal after all.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later her knee was screaming in agony, she could no longer feel her lower legs, and yet another man had started yet another long-winded speech. She suppressed a moan and wished there was some discreet way to shift her legs out from beneath her thighs without drawing everybody\u2019s attention to the movement. She was very much aware of the glances Dante was throwing in her direction and fought to keep her face impassive even while she felt like weeping.</p> <p>Finally, everybody raised their small glasses of beer and held them aloft. The speaker said a few more things before ending with a word Cleo was happily familiar with.</p><p>\u201cKanpai!\u201d He yelled the Japanese version of \u201cCheers,\u201d and everybody followed suit.</p><p>\u201cKanpai!\u201d There was loud and manly laughter\u2014Cleo and Ms. Inokawa being the only women present\u2014as everybody clinked glasses and started drinking.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay for you to move your legs to the side now,\u201d Ms. Inokawa whispered, obviously sensing her distress.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can move my legs,\u201d Cleo whispered back, while she painfully tried to shift her position without crying out.</p><p>\u201cDaijoubu?\u201d the woman asked, and Cleo recognized the question\u2014which she\u2019d heard often over the course of the week\u2014as \u201cAre you okay?\u201d She shrugged miserably. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll probably be okay once I get the feeling back in my legs. They\u2019ve fallen asleep.\u201d Although her knee was a different matter entirely, she wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d done some damage to it, but it definitely didn\u2019t feel all right. She tried to placate the woman with a smile and picked up the bottle of beer placed in front of her and held it up to Ms. Inokawa. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>It was traditional to pour for the people seated closest to you and considered poor form to allow your neighbor\u2019s glass to run dry. The guy on her right, whom she didn\u2019t know at all, was holding a bottle up and smiling expectantly, and even though she pretty much hated beer, she managed a smile and a nod while he added the drop of beer that would be needed to fill the glass to the brim again. If she didn\u2019t stay alert, she would probably wind up extremely drunk, because it was almost impossible to monitor one\u2019s alcohol intake in a situation like this.</p><p>Things got rowdy quite quickly, and it was a little shocking to watch the previously somber Japanese businessmen get wasted and exceptionally loud and cheerful in pretty short order. Nobody remained seated\u2014pouring etiquette went out the window\u2014and soon people were crawling about on the floor from one person to the next, chatting and topping up each other\u2019s beers. She noticed that quite a few of the men had immediately moved toward Dante and were all vying to pour his drinks. He took the time to chat amicably with each and every man, looking sober as a judge but cultivating a jovial manner that Cleo didn\u2019t believe for a second was genuine.</p><p>A few of the younger men made a point of talking with her, some in great English, others a little less fluently. Cleo forced aside her pain, kept smiling, and delighted the men when she butchered a few of the standard Japanese phrases she\u2019d learned over the course of the week. They were ridiculously flattering of her bad Japanese, and remembering Daisuke\u2019s reaction in the car earlier, she modestly waved off their compliments.</p> <p>She turned to say something to Ms. Inokawa, but the woman was gone. Cleo cast her gaze toward Dante, expecting to see the woman fawning over him, but she wasn\u2019t there. Dante, however, met and held her eyes for a few long moments. His face was completely inscrutable, almost grim. Cleo frowned and wondered if he was pissed off with her yet again. She was the first to break eye contact, still looking for Ms. Inokawa, and she was surprised to see the other woman blatantly flirting with Craig Templeton, the contractor for the hotel build. The handsome older man was smiling and flirting back.</p><p>Well, that was new.</p><p>Cleo turned her gaze back to Dante to see if Ms. Inokawa\u2019s shift in romantic attentions bothered him, but he was still watching Cleo intently. His complete focus was starting to make her a little hot under the collar, and she shifted restlessly. Unfortunately, the inadvertent movement caused a shaft of pain to shoot through her knee, and she flinched. Dante\u2019s entire body went still, and his head tilted slightly to the left as he watched her quizzically. In that moment he reminded her of a wild animal on the scent trail of something small and wounded, and Cleo desperately tried to throw him off that trail with a casual grin and a careless wiggle of her fingers. As expected, the frivolous and flirtatious wave did the trick, and he gave her a frown before returning his attention to one of the many sycophants huddling around him. Cleo heaved a relieved sigh and gave her knee a surreptitious little massage before focusing on one of the earnest young men trying to have a conversation with her.</p><p>It was going to be a long night.</p><p>At around two the following morning, Cleo was more than ready to call it quits. The merry group had dragged Cleo and Dante from one night spot to another and was now insisting on karaoke.</p> <p>\u201cI have to get back to the hotel,\u201d she whispered to Dante, who didn\u2019t look as drunk as the rest of their loud group. In fact, he looked much too sober for a man who\u2019d been drinking all night, and she wondered about that for a few moments before he distracted her with a glare.</p><p>\u201cYou have to do no such thing,\u201d he snapped, keeping his voice low. By now her knee was radiating almost constant pain, and all Cleo wanted was a hot bath, pain medication, and a long, long sleep.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need me here. This isn\u2019t part of my job description, and you can\u2019t force me to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of your unofficial duties is to accompany me to business lunches and dinners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnofficial as in not contracted,\u201d she pointed out, and he rubbed the nape of his neck before switching tactics.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then, what about coming along in a personal capacity, as my . . .\u201d He struggled to find a definition, and she raised a brow and folded her arms across her chest.</p> <p>\u201cGirlfriend?\u201d she supplied, and he blanched.</p><p>\u201cGod, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMistress?\u201d If possible, he went even paler.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d He hesitated a few moments longer before shrugging and continuing, \u201cAs my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf a sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, be a pal and let me go to bed. I\u2019m tired and in pain.\u201d Okay, she hadn\u2019t meant to reveal that last bit; it just slipped out. His eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cIn pain?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. My knee hurts,\u201d she confessed.</p><p>\u201cThis is why you have been limping since we left the first restaurant?\u201d He had noticed that? She had tried very hard to disguise the slight limp.</p><p>\u201cDamaso-san,\u201d one of the other men called from a few meters away, \u201cyou are coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChotto matte,\u201d Dante snapped back. \u201cGive me a moment!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cleo still stood with her arms crossed and her bad knee bent so that her other leg was taking most of her weight.</p><p>\u201cExplain!\u201d he commanded, pointing to her knee.</p><p>\u201cI have a weak knee, and sitting in seiza made it flare up a bit.\u201d</p><p>He swore colorfully in about three different languages before running an agitated hand through his hair.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your knee?\u201d he asked after a moment, and she huffed impatiently.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen every inch of my body,\u201d she said. \u201cI assumed that, over the course of the week, you\u2019d have noticed the great, ugly scar on my knee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did,\u201d he admitted. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been meaning to ask you about it. Only\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly you\u2019ve never had the time?\u201d she completed. Where would he find the time? At night he was fully occupied with seducing her, and his days were dominated by back-to-back meetings required to get his precious hotel built. And then there was the obvious fact that he simply didn\u2019t care enough to delve into personal details. They didn\u2019t speak about anything other than superficial nonsense when they were alone at night, and once the sex started, the conversation dwindled down to what felt good and where.</p><p>\u201cI was aware of the scar. I just never really appreciated that your knee might have been weakened by it. Which was foolish considering the extent of the scarring. But in my defense, it never seems to bother you, you usually walk without impediment, and you\u2019re quite limber\u2014as I can personally attest.\u201d</p> <p>His comment flashed her back to two nights before, when they\u2019d had sex in the middle of his room, his hands supporting her butt and her legs wrapped around his waist, without even a wall to bolster them. It had been quite a testament to his strength and her flexibility. Only their mutual orgasms had finally sent them sinking down to the carpeted floor. She flushed at the memory and felt uncomfortably hot as she remembered how intense that session had been, the fear of falling combined with the excitement of maintaining rhythm and balance.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d she said, hoping to divert them both back to the point at hand, \u201cthe knee doesn\u2019t really bother me unless I\u2019m testing it, and, trust me, that seiza thing tested it sorely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is the injury?\u201d he asked, looking deeply uncomfortable with the question, and she knew it was because he felt compelled to ask her a personal question to make himself look\u2014and possibly feel\u2014like less of an uncaring dick.</p><p>\u201cI injured it about three years ago,\u201d she recalled, her lips twisting as she remembered the catastrophic fall that had killed all of her dreams.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Again, the question sounded torn from him. He clearly hated asking and probably had no real interest in the answer.</p><p>\u201cI had an accident and needed knee surgery. The end. You don\u2019t have to ask me any more questions, sir. You\u2019ve shown an interest. Noted.\u201d</p> <p>He said nothing, merely watched her for a very long moment, that handsome face maddeningly blank.</p><p>\u201cSo be it.\u201d He shrugged dismissively. \u201cWe will return to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go back. I can make it back on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndoubtedly,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut I find myself rather tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d she asked on a whisper, and his lips quirked in that sexy, dreadful cat-that-got-the-cream grin.</p><p>\u201c\u2014ish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, although she knew exactly what he meant by that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired-ish,\u201d he clarified, even though the expression on his face suggested he knew he didn\u2019t really have to. \u201cI may find my second wind by the time we return to the hotel.\u201d</p> <p>Of course he would.</p><p>And did.</p><p>Breakfast felt different. Usually the meal, which was always delivered to their suite, was eaten in a rush while Dante rapid-fired a list of the day\u2019s requirements at Cleo. Today, with the urgency of the week behind them and the memory of the previous night\u2019s fantastic sex still throbbing between them, everything felt odd. Different. Wrong.</p><p>They would leave for the airport in under an hour, and they were in this weird space of nothingness where everything had been arranged and there was no more to be done other than enjoy the rare moment of peace and quiet.</p><p>Only it wasn\u2019t peaceful and it was much too quiet.</p><p>Cleo swallowed a piece of toast that felt like sandpaper as it slid down her dry throat. She chased it down with some acidic orange juice and wondered at her nervousness.</p><p>She got up and restlessly made her way over to the huge picture windows beside the Bakokko armchairs, which now had some pretty raunchy memories attached to them. There was a layer of smog hanging over the city that did nothing to detract from Tokyo\u2019s vibrancy. She had voraciously read her guidebook from beginning to end, diligently folding over the pages dedicated to places that she had longed to see, promising herself she would come back and visit someday. She knew that it was unlikely to happen and considered herself lucky to have seen this much of it at least, from way up in her glass tower and the claustrophobic confines of the car.</p><p>\u201cMiss Knight.\u201d Dante\u2019s quiet voice intruded upon her thoughts, and she couldn\u2019t help but wonder if he\u2019d called her Miss Knight because he\u2019d forgotten her name again. The absolute ludicrousness of a man who knew her body better than she did addressing her so formally caused a tiny burble of hysterical laughter to rise in her chest. She swallowed it back down, instinct telling her he wouldn\u2019t appreciate her humor right now.</p><p>She turned to face him, hiding a grimace when her still-sore knee twinged in response to the movement. Sure enough, the grim set of his jaw and the tense line of his mouth confirmed that he was ready to have a Serious Discussion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWait.\u201d She held up a hand and he paused. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me. Let me guess. It was fun while it lasted but now it\u2014whatever it was\u2014is over, and we will never speak of it again. How did I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will require you to sign a nondisclosure agreement,\u201d he said stiffly, and the words stole the breath right out of her. She felt so outraged, insulted, and\u2014shockingly\u2014hurt.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if I don\u2019t sign it?\u201d she asked through stiff lips. \u201cI mean, aren\u2019t you supposed to sign those things before we do the stuff we\u2019re not supposed to disclose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually, yes, but we were in bed together before I had a chance to consider the possibility that something sexual might happen between us. We don\u2019t suit. You\u2019re not my usual . . .\u201d His voice petered off as he grasped that his next words would be in bad taste. Still, he might not have said them, but they hovered between them like an offensive odor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your usual type,\u201d she finished for him. \u201cAnd because of that, you never thought we\u2019d wind up screwing each other\u2019s brains out. So you didn\u2019t protect yourself the way you normally would have.</p><p>\u201cDo you make all of your lovers sign nondisclosure agreements before you sleep with them?\u201d she asked combatively, and his jaw clenched.</p><p>\u201cUsually.\u201d The tight one-word answer surprised her.</p><p>\u201cYou do? All of them?\u201d</p><p>He seemed to have no shortage of female companions, and the thought of him going through this same distasteful scene with all of them was a little revolting.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust many people,\u201d he admitted, and his broad shoulders shifted uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a very romantic way to start a relationship,\u201d she noted absently, still a bit taken aback by his admission.</p><p>\u201cThe women I usually associate with understand the need for privacy. Nobody wants their private lives smeared all over the papers for the titillation of the masses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think that\u2019s something I would do?\u201d she asked, stung.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know you, Miss Knight. I don\u2019t want to know you. We enjoyed each other and that\u2019s the end of it. What you are or aren\u2019t capable of doesn\u2019t interest me. I want you to sign the agreement so that I no longer have to consider the possibility that you may one day decide to do a cheeky little sexpos\u00e9 on your \u2018tryst with Dante Damaso.\u2019\u201d Tryst was such an un-Dante-like word for him to use that for a moment she could only gape at him before his words sank in properly.</p><p>\u201cHow do I know that you won\u2019t be the one to brag to your mates about screwing your secretary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, you\u2019re not my secretary, and secondly, this agreement would protect you from such an eventuality. It works both ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what happens if I don\u2019t sign your agreement?\u201d she asked again, trying very hard to disguise the tremble in her voice. \u201cDo I lose my job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour job has never been, and will never be, at stake because of our personal association,\u201d he said, the answer coming so quickly that she didn\u2019t doubt its veracity. \u201cBut this gesture would go a long way toward convincing me of your integrity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet it does nothing for yours.\u201d She could see that he didn\u2019t like the idea of his integrity being called into question. He tugged at his cuffs and straightened his already immaculate tie before launching another volley at her.</p><p>\u201cYou sign it and you have the comfort of knowing that none of this ever gets out. That your brother and friends never discover how very quickly you fell into bed with me.\u201d He played dirty, and for a second she almost fell for his bluff.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you tell anybody about this when you just admitted that you don\u2019t want it to come out?\u201d she asked skeptically. \u201cAlso I\u2019m a consenting adult, and you\u2019re not my first sexual partner. I\u2019m pretty sure my brother and friends don\u2019t have any misconceptions about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they don\u2019t think you\u2019re an easy little slut either, do they?\u201d</p><p>She could feel the blood draining from her face at the question. She struggled to breathe as the emotional impact of that sucker punch nearly caused her to double over in shock and pain. Why did this hurt? It shouldn\u2019t hurt. He meant nothing to her. He didn\u2019t have the power to hurt her. And yet . . . there was pain. An awful lot of pain.</p> <p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m a slut?\u201d For a fleeting instant, she saw an expression almost like regret flash across his face.</p><p>\u201cI could make it look like you are.\u201d He didn\u2019t answer her question, not really, but the failure to give her a yes or no was more of an indictment than an actual reply. \u201cI could make you look like a scheming, manipulative, money-grubbing little tramp, while I come out smelling like a rose. But if you sign this agreement, you\u2019d be protected from that. We could both go back to our lives none the worse for wear. Failure to sign would force me to play dirty. To go on the offensive, and neither of us wants that.\u201d</p><p>She hated him so much in that instant that she was shaking with it. He had to know how she felt, had to see it in her eyes, but he didn\u2019t even flinch, merely held the document out with a steady hand until she took it from him. Cleo tried to read it, but her eyes were blurred with tears she hadn\u2019t even known were there. She took the pen from him and signed in the allotted space beside his sprawling signature.</p><p>She handed both pen and paper back to him with violently shaking hands, wanting nothing more than to get out of his presence and take another shower. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is for the best, Cleo,\u201d he murmured gently, almost regretfully, and she laughed bitterly as she turned away from him.</p><p>\u201cI would rather you didn\u2019t talk to me unless it\u2019s work related, sir. I don\u2019t think I could stomach your empty platitudes right now.\u201d She retreated to her own room without a backward glance.</p><p>The return journey to Cape Town felt endless. Dante and Cleo barely exchanged a word between Narita airport and Cape Town International. They separated in Dubai for much-needed showers in the first-class lounge, and Cleo picked listlessly at some fruit while waiting for the boarding call of their next flight. She didn\u2019t see Dante at all between disembarking and boarding in Dubai, and she preferred it that way. The privacy of their first-class suites, which had been new and exciting to Cleo on the way to Tokyo, had merely made the flight back to Cape Town tolerable because she didn\u2019t have to see him and could actually manage to squeeze in a few hours of sleep.</p><p>The cold, windy, and gray weather of Cape Town suited Cleo\u2019s mood perfectly. She was moody, exhausted, her knee still hurt, and she just wanted to get home. Dante caught up with her after they had both cleared customs and baggage claim, just before they stepped into the arrivals lounge. He grabbed hold of her elbow and turned her toward him.</p> <p>\u201cThe car will take you home first. I\u2019m sure you must be tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy driver, James, will be picking us up. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assumed I would have to find my own way home from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. We\u2019ll drop you off first.\u201d He steered her toward the door to the arrivals lounge, and she jerked her arm from his grip before coming to a standstill. The other first- and business-class passengers gave them curious looks as they streamed by.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that. I\u2019ve made alternative arrangements.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>He looked like he wanted to argue, but after a brief hesitation, he shrugged and strode away from her without another word. She watched him go, hating how conflicted she felt. She should feel relief that their messy little interlude was over and that he was gone, not regret and longing and pain.</p><p>She followed him out into the arrivals lounge and saw her best friend almost immediately. Cal\u2014her ex\u2013dance partner\u2014was easy to spot because, aside from Dante, he was one of the tallest men she knew. He stood head and shoulders above everyone else in the crowd. She saw his tousled blond hair before he saw her five-foot-one frame and black hair, which wasn\u2019t as easy to spot in a crowd of people. When he did finally see her, his handsome face broke into a huge grin, and he waved enthusiastically. Cleo fought her way past the jostling mass of people and flung herself at him. She was just so relieved to see a friendly face that she couldn\u2019t help herself. He lifted her clear off the floor\u2014it had always been so easy for him to pick her up\u2014and hugged her warmly, enfolding her completely in his arms. Cal was the best hugger.</p><p>She clung to him, feeling safe and cocooned in his embrace, and her urgency and desperation must have been obvious because his arms tightened.</p> <p>\u201cHey, sweetheart,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and kept her nose buried in his neck. She loved the familiar smell of him. He put her down and gently removed her arms from his neck, wanting to see her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d Damn him, he knew her too well. And everything she felt was still too fresh to hide from him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it right now.\u201d A surreptitious glance around informed her that they\u2019d attracted a bit of attention from passersby, and she knew that Dante was probably close by as well.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Bless him, he was always so understanding. He looked around for her bag\u2014a single medium-size roller suitcase\u2014and raised a dubious brow when he saw it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a miserly little packer. How did you survive a week in Tokyo with just that little bag?\u201d he asked as he grabbed her elbow with one hand and the suitcase handle with the other.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t exactly have time to socialize. This was sufficient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would need a bag that size for hair product alone,\u201d he said dismissively, and she giggled, surprising herself.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t I know it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagnificence like this\u201d\u2014he tossed his hair for emphasis\u2014\u201cdoesn\u2019t come easily.\u201d</p><p>Another giggle. Cal was exactly what she needed right now. She hooked her arm through his and rested her head on his shoulder and let his nonsense chatter wash over her like a soothing balm as he led her toward where he\u2019d parked.</p><p>Dante watched Cleo leave with that blond behemoth; she was clinging to the man\u2019s arm and staring up at him adoringly as they walked away. So much for thinking he\u2019d hurt her back in Tokyo. He\u2019d had an uncharacteristic flash of conscience when he\u2019d said the things necessary to get her to sign that nondisclosure agreement. It had been dirty and unfair, but it had gotten the job done. Still, Dante wasn\u2019t a complete monster. He felt moved by her tears and even a little guilty in the face of her obvious distress. But to see her now with that guy was like watching an entirely different person, and he was glad he hadn\u2019t been completely taken in by her little-girl-lost act back in Tokyo. He always protected himself: condoms and nondisclosure agreements without exception. No unwanted pregnancies and no unwanted scandals. It kept things clean and uncomplicated, which was exactly the way he preferred his life. Women served a purpose, and until Cleo they had all known exactly what they were getting into with him. He was on shaky legal ground getting her to sign it the way he had, but without it he felt naked and vulnerable. Feelings he would never admit to out loud. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Still, despite the fact that his bullying tactics had left a bad taste in his mouth, he couldn\u2019t regret the fact that he had stooped to them. It was over now. The document was safely signed and would be notarized as soon as possible.</p><p>He had a very brief flash of regret that he wouldn\u2019t experience Cleo Knight in his bed again before he put her firmly out of his mind.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever actually hated someone before,\u201d Cleo confessed as she licked the salt off the rim of her margarita. She paused for a moment and thought about what she\u2019d just said. \u201cBut God, I hate that man so much. The thought of seeing him again on Monday turns my stomach, and I\u2019m so tempted to quit this job.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t quit, hon.\u201d Cal tut-tutted. \u201cWho\u2019ll pay the rent or buy the food? Until I find a job, you\u2019re the only one keeping this boat afloat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find something soon, Cal.\u201d She patted his broad shoulder a little drunkenly before going back to contemplate her curiously unsatisfying frozen margarita again. \u201cNow, can we please focus on my predicament?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so the guy is a world-class asshole,\u201d Cal recapped. \u201cHe treated you shabbily, which would earn him a well-deserved punch in the face if he were here right now, and you hate him but still have to work with him.\u201d</p><p>Cleo nodded morosely, the pit in her stomach increasing with every word. She put aside her half-finished drink \u0327 wishing she actually felt like getting rip-roaring drunk. It might have helped a little.</p><p>\u201cNow, what I really want to know\u201d\u2014Cal leaned forward conspiratorially\u2014\u201cis he any good in the sack?\u201d</p> <p>Cleo sighed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fantastic, and that just makes me hate him more. Should I even be telling you all of this? I mean, I feel like I\u2019m breaking that stupid contract with every syllable I utter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably are.\u201d Cal shrugged. \u201cBut if I can trust you to keep all my sordid secrets\u2014you could sink me if you wanted to and you know it\u2014then you can trust me with this.\u201d</p><p>And she did trust Cal; he was like a second brother to her. Her dance partner for years, he had seen her through all her trials and tribulations. He felt responsible for her fall and had been her emotional support while she\u2019d tried to come to terms with everything she\u2019d lost after the accident. He was the only one who truly understood. Luc didn\u2019t get it \u0327 her nondancing friends didn\u2019t get it, but Cal got it. Cal knew what it was like to feel alive only when you were dancing, and he recognized that she felt like the most important part of her had died after the accident. He was the one who\u2019d gotten her out of bed in the mornings, had taken her to physical therapy, had bossed her into dancing again, even though she was just a shadow of her former self. He had helped her understand that while she would never again be the supremely talented dancer who had once had dance companies vying for her attention, she could still dance. It was in her blood, a part of her physical makeup, and she would never lose it completely.</p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019m saying is that the man is seriously hot,\u201d Cal said. \u201cAnd if he wasn\u2019t so obviously and uncompromisingly hetero, I would happily make a play for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re way too good for the likes of him,\u201d Cleo said.</p> <p>\u201cAs are you,\u201d he said, completely serious.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best, Cal.\u201d She sighed and leaned in for a hug. He complied and she sagged against him, letting him support her slight weight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad we\u2019re roomies,\u201d she crooned, and when he laughed, the sound had a bitter edge to it.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly roomies,\u201d he corrected. \u201cMore like freeloader and working stiff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a freeloader, Cal. We\u2019ve all been through rough spots, and you\u2019ve done so much for me . . .\u201d She had difficulty talking around the lump in her throat. \u201cSo don\u2019t you dare denigrate yourself like that in front of me again, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, miss,\u201d he teased, making an effort to shake off his obvious depression, even though she could tell that it lingered just beneath the surface. \u201cNow tell me more. I want to know everything\u2014length, girth, angle. Pointing downward, straight ahead, or kissing the navel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d She choked back a laugh.</p><p>\u201cWell, if that thing points down, it just looks flaccid and . . . I dunno, incapable somehow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not discussing this with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You told me all about Frank Whatsisface\u2019s, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not. This is the first time I can recall us discussing the angle of any guy\u2019s erection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he conceded, after some thought. \u201cBut that Frank guy was really boring. I wasn\u2019t interested in hearing about his antics in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, he was nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was always really sweet to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd super boring.\u201d</p><p>Cleo sighed. She really couldn\u2019t argue with him. Frank Sharp, whom she\u2019d dated for two months and slept with twice\u2014in the same night\u2014had been a regular snoozefest. Both in bed and out of it. Cleo had actually fallen asleep during the sex act, both times. Not her finest moment. She had broken it off with him immediately after that and hadn\u2019t dated anyone else in more than a year. Dante was the first man she\u2019d slept with since then, and poor Frank couldn\u2019t compete with that. Most men would have difficulty competing with a guy like Dante Damaso.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss the matter any further,\u201d Cleo said decisively. \u201cI\u2019ve probably broken a dozen of his stupid nondisclosure rules just by telling you about it. Best to let the matter rest and pretend it never happened.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cal gave her a long, level look and she dodged his gaze. He could look as skeptical as he liked, but Cleo was going to pretend it never happened if it killed her!</p><p>Cleo had all weekend to think about what she would say and how she would act when she saw Dante again on Monday. She practiced her cool, slightly disdainful looks in the mirror, and her professional \u201cGood morning, sir,\u201d \u201cYes, sir,\u201d \u201cNo, sir,\u201d and \u201cAs you wish, sir\u201d out loud every morning and evening. Yet, she was still a bundle of nerves when she walked into the office Monday morning. He must have come to the office at some point over the weekend, because even though he clearly hadn\u2019t arrived yet, there was a Dictaphone full of e-mails she had to get ready, and two A4-size manila envelopes with her name sitting in the middle of her desk. She frowned at the envelopes before picking up the flatter one. She took a deep breath and stuck her finger beneath the flap to open it. The sheaf of papers inside was exactly what she\u2019d been expecting to see: her copy of the nondisclosure agreement, officially notarized. She shook her head and shoved it back into the envelope and then into her desk drawer. Well, so much for being cool, calm, and collected this morning. One stupid envelope and she was feeling anxious and angry at the same time. Her gaze shifted to the other envelope, which was slightly bulkier than the first. She picked it up cautiously, having absolutely no clue what could be inside it. It was ridiculously light, lighter than the first envelope, and Cleo ripped it open with less care than she had the first one. She upended it and watched as a piece of paper fluttered to the desk, followed by a scrap of white cotton. She blinked at it uncomprehendingly for a few seconds before her eyes widened in recognition.</p><p>She gasped, blushed, and grabbed up the Hello Kitty boy shorts in a lightning-fast move, terrified that someone would see them. Only after they were safely tucked away in her bag did she shift her attention to the paper that had accompanied the panties.</p><p>Sure enough, Dante\u2019s bold, masculine writing was scrawled across the small square of paper. All it said was:</p> <p>These got mixed in with my stuff. \u2014DD</p><p>Cleo crumpled the paper up in her fist and tossed it in the wastepaper basket. Lovely. Just when she\u2019d resolved to never again think of their encounter in Japan, he had to bring it all back in graphic detail without even having to be physically present.</p><p>She sat down behind her desk after getting the fancy coffee machine up and running, and watering her old enemy, the ficus. She was well into the e-mails when Dante finally sauntered in, nearly an hour later.</p><p>Completely focused on her work up until that moment, Cleo was aware of his presence almost immediately. She tensed, all her practice and preparation instantly forgotten in the face of his overwhelming presence.</p><p>\u201cUh . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood morning, Miss Knight,\u201d he inserted smoothly, before she could get a single word out. \u201cI trust the jet lag isn\u2019t too bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s . . .\u201d Damn. Why couldn\u2019t she speak? He waited for a moment, but when it became clear that she had nothing to offer other than that one strangled word, he cleared his throat and gestured toward the computer.</p><p>\u201cAre you nearly done with those?\u201d</p><p>She nodded mutely.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He shoved his hands into his trouser pockets and rocked back slightly on his heels. \u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>Why was he just standing there, staring at her? Why didn\u2019t he say something? Or leave? Or tell her to go to so-and-so\u2019s office for the rest of the day?</p> <p>\u201cPeter Whitman\u2019s secretary has resigned,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cAnd I feel that the position would be more in keeping with your skill set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a slight dip in salary, but you knew that you\u2019d eventually have to take a step down, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d she said, finally finding her voice. She stared down at her hands, spread on the keyboard in front of her, like they were the most fascinating things in the world.</p><p>\u201cRight, then. That\u2019s settled,\u201d he said a little hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure who Peter Whitman is,\u201d she admitted. \u201cAnd when do I start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll spend the rest of the week here, but you\u2019ll start with him next Monday. He\u2019s the head of HR. I was vacillating between HR and accounting, but I thought that, since you seem to be such a people person, you\u2019d find HR more interesting.\u201d</p><p>The comment astonished her, and she raised her eyes to meet his surprisingly intense gaze head-on. His penetrating stare was a little unnerving, but she was quite touched that he had considered her personality before making his decision.</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, you know that this job is way beyond your actual capabilities, right?\u201d Why was he still talking about this? He sounded like a man who was determined to justify himself.</p><p>\u201cWell, if I didn\u2019t before, I certainly know it now,\u201d she said dryly, and his frown told her that he didn\u2019t appreciate her flippant comment.</p><p>\u201cThis transfer has nothing to do with what happened between us in Tokyo.\u201d Ooh, he went there. She hadn\u2019t expected him to actually go there. \u201cIt was inevitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it was,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s rather sudden. After all, Donna is still on maternity leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019ll be gone for another six months. I can\u2019t have you here for another six months. You\u2019ve proven yourself quite capable, but I need someone who can actually handle every aspect of the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Weirdly, it felt like she actually had him on the back foot, and that made her feel a little more in control. \u201cWould you like your coffee now, sir?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t reply for the longest time, before nodding curtly and swiveling on his heel to head to his office. After the door shut behind him, she dropped her head to where her hands still rested on the keyboard and just sat there for a few minutes, trying to recover her poise.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said to herself as she pushed away from the desk and started to go slowly about organizing his urgent mail and pouring the extremely bitter dark-roast coffee he preferred.</p><p>She gave a perfunctory knock on the intimidating double doors that led to his massive office before pushing her way inside. Dante sat behind his exquisitely crafted bird\u2019s-eye maple-and-walnut antique desk and stared broodingly at his huge computer screen. He had his elbows on the desk and his hands steepled in front of him, the tips of his forefingers pressed against his lips. Her entry drew his gaze from the computer, and he stared at her over the top of his fingers.</p><p>She rounded the desk, placed the coffee mug beside his right elbow, and centered the mail in front of him. He didn\u2019t say a word while she was doing that, and she was acutely aware of his closeness, of the scent of him, the heat of him, and couldn\u2019t get back to the other side of the desk fast enough. She stood there, her hands clasped in front of her and her eyes downcast, waiting to hear where he would parcel her off to this morning, but when he said nothing for the longest time, she dared a glance up at him. He still stared at her, his eyes narrowed and his lips pursed. He was slowly moving his mouth back and forth across his fingertips, looking lost in thought at he watched her.</p> <p>\u201cWill that be all, sir?\u201d she asked expectantly. Maybe he\u2019d send her to HR to meet her future boss. It would do her good to apprentice with his current secretary. Frankly, she couldn\u2019t wait to get away from the top floor and its high-powered, frenetic pace.</p><p>\u201cDid you get my package?\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat and shifted restlessly at the unexpected question.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Thank you, sir. I\u2019ll have a proper read-through later, since I didn\u2019t get a chance to check the finer details on Thursday before I signed it.\u201d She couldn\u2019t resist the dig, and she watched him closely for his reaction. But he revealed nothing, keeping his face completely passive, even while his gaze darkened.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the package I meant,\u201d he said after a few minutes of awkward silence. His deep, husky voice sent shock waves reverberating through her body as the words registered, and she felt a blush starting from her breasts and sweeping right up to the top of her head. She clamped her mouth shut and glared at him, refusing to respond to his words.</p> <p>\u201cI meant, did you get your panties?\u201d he prompted perversely when she said nothing. \u201cThey were sweet. Not my favorites, mind you. That honor belongs to the blue Daisy Duck pair with the little white-heart polka dots all over them. Do you know which ones I mean?\u201d</p><p>Of course she knew which ones he meant; he\u2019d removed them with his teeth that last night in Tokyo. He\u2019d been so absorbed with what was being revealed beneath the underwear that she hadn\u2019t for one second considered that the design would register with him.</p><p>\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t talk like this,\u201d she said shakily. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cInappropriate,\u201d he completed. \u201cI know. The problem is that when I\u2019m around you, all thought of appropriate behavior completely flees my mind. Now why the hell do you suppose that is?\u201d He sounded angry as he said the words, and Cleo shared his frustration. He was like an addictive drug that she couldn\u2019t flush out of her system. Every time she got in his general vicinity, she turned into mush and her brain stopped functioning.</p><p>He got up and rounded the desk until he stood behind her, close enough that she could feel the heat emanating off him in waves and his breath in her hair.</p><p>\u201cI took one look at you behind that desk this morning, all\u2014how do you say\u2014prim and proper? And I wanted this,\u201d he said, his voice low. He didn\u2019t have to explain what this was; they both knew and they both accepted it even though they both hated the inexplicable need.</p> <p>He moved, wrapping one strong arm around her torso and gripping her jaw with his hand as he tugged her back against his hard body. She could feel his iron-hard erection grinding into the small of her back. He sucked her earlobe into his mouth for the briefest of moments before moving down to nuzzle the sensitive area just below her ear.</p><p>Her knees buckled, and his other hand came up to cup the nape of her neck and gently but inexorably exert enough pressure to let her know exactly what he wanted. She complied, bracing herself on her elbows as she bent over his desk.</p><p>His hands went roaming, tugging her blouse from her skirt and burrowing their way beneath the silk chiffon until they found and cupped her small breasts through the lace of her demi bra. The slightest of tugs and he had the bra tucked beneath her breasts and his thumbs flicking away at her sensitive nipples. He played there for a while, knowing that very little more than that was required to get her going, before his hands trailed down over her flat stomach and then around to the small of her back, his fingertips skirting along the sensitive skin above the waistband of her skirt. When his thumbs met in the center of her back just above the slight swell of her behind, he shifted the position of his hands until he had her backside cupped in his palms. Cleo whimpered, unbelievably turned on by being spread out on his desk in his office in broad daylight.</p><p>His hands grabbed a couple of fistfuls of twill and dragged her skirt up, up, ever so slowly up, until\u2014after an excruciatingly long time\u2014she felt cool air on the backs of her thighs. Dante\u2014who\u2019d been silent up until this point\u2014groaned when he finally had her skirt up over her back and her panties revealed to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHell, yes, I want some honey,\u201d he ground out, and Cleo dimly apprehended that he was responding to Winnie the Pooh\u2019s \u201cHunny?\u201d question on the back of her boy shorts. He hooked a thumb into each side of the shorts and dragged them down to her knees, before kneeling behind her. Cleo held her breath, hoping his intention was what she was anticipating, and sure enough . . .</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she moaned when his tongue immediately went to work. She\u2019d gotten so used to him doing this for her that she no longer felt self-conscious about the act, which had always embarrassed her with other guys. She curled her fingers against the surface of his desk and blindly stared at the rapidly cooling mug of coffee about a foot in front of her. She moved her upper body lower and lower until her torso and chest were flat against the desk and her cheek was pressed to the coolness of the surface. She spread her arms out on either side of her and just surrendered herself completely to him. She was on the verge of coming when he stopped, and she cried out in frustration until she felt him step between her thighs. She heard the sound of his zipper, the crinkle of a condom wrapper, and then . . . dear God\u2014complete bliss when he finally penetrated her. He had her so primed that he barely had the tip in before she went up onto her toes, her back arching like a cat\u2019s, as her orgasm took her.</p><p>His hands on her hips held her still, and he waited until her climax had waned before resuming his slow and thorough conquest of her very willing body. She was building up to her third orgasm when the phone rang, adding a reckless sense of exhibitionism to their excitement that had only been hinted at before. The complete and utter inappropriateness of the setting added a titillating edge to the sex that rushed her headlong into another climax so intense that she actually blacked out for a couple of seconds. She came to moments later, in time to hear him groan, the first time she\u2019d ever heard a sound from him during one of his climaxes. He was usually completely silent, just a catch of the breath followed by a long exhale. This soft groan was new, as was the whispered expletive that accompanied it. He went completely limp, his full weight descending onto her back for a few short moments before he stepped back and removed himself from her both physically and emotionally in one smooth movement. He gently pulled her panties back up and lowered her skirt, covering her up with such care that Cleo felt almost cherished. The feeling disappeared when he moved away hastily, leaving Cleo to push herself up with arms that felt like jelly. Her entire body felt wobbly, and she sank into the chair opposite his desk, not sure how to cope with this.</p><p>Dante staggered back to his side of the desk, lowered himself into his chair, and immediately swiveled it around until he faced the window. She stared at the back of his head, feeling wounded and completely rejected by the unmistakably dismissive gesture. If he wanted her to leave, he\u2019d have to wait a few moments until she got her breath and motor functions back.</p><p>Neither of them said a word as their breathing gradually returned to normal. Cleo, her body still feeling like it could go back up in flames any second, moved gingerly in her chair, wondering if she would ever be capable of leaving the room again.</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re going to need another nondisclosure agreement.\u201d She quickly grasped the horrific consequences of their stupidity. His shoulders tensed and he shook his head, still not turning to look at her.</p><p>\u201cThe other one has it covered. Past and future sexual encounters, if I remember the wording correctly.\u201d</p><p>How terribly optimistic of him, she thought caustically.</p><p>\u201cNot optimistic,\u201d he countered, and she grimaced when she realized that she\u2019d spoken aloud. \u201cRealistic. We have some crazy chemistry. A bit of backsliding was inevitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more after this, though,\u201d she said adamantly, and she watched his shoulders rise and fall in a sigh.</p><p>\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t mean for this to happen. It\u2019s probably just a remnant of our . . .\u201d He paused, unable to find the correct word.</p><p>\u201cAffair?\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cNo. Our . . .\u201d Another pause.</p><p>\u201cRelationship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, will you stop trying to complete my sentences?\u201d He sounded wholly exasperated, and he spun his chair around to glare at her. \u201cOur thing in Tokyo.\u201d</p><p>Cleo was too busy taking in the state of him to harangue him for his weak choice of words. How had his hair gotten so messy when she hadn\u2019t run her fingers through it? And his tie was undone, another thing he must have done himself. His shirttails were out and . . . God, he had another impressive hard-on. The damned thing was tireless.</p><p>\u201cI think you should transfer me to Peter Whitman\u2019s office tomorrow. I could apprentice with his current secretary and learn the ropes from him or her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should I do in the meantime? I don\u2019t have a replacement for you.\u201d He sounded annoyed and put out by her suggestion.</p><p>\u201cAll I ever do is water your plant, make your coffee, and send your e-mails. Any idiot can do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want any other idiot, I want you, until I find a more qualified person for the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this because of my special uh . . . skill set?\u201d</p><p>He looked confused by her question.</p><p>\u201cWe have already established that your skill set is not suited to the job,\u201d he reminded her.</p> <p>\u201cNot that . . .\u201d She leaned forward and waved a hand back and forth. \u201cThis. Us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, sure . . . but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCleo, if you\u2019re suggesting that I\u2019m trying to keep you here so that I can have you around to fuck on demand, then I have to tell you, you\u2019re mistaken.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood, because that\u2019s not even an option for you.\u201d</p><p>He snorted scornfully and gave her a pointed and scathing once-over, not missing a single detail of her dishevelment.</p><p>\u201cThis was different,\u201d she said defensively. \u201cYou didn\u2019t demand anything I wasn\u2019t willing to give.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never ask for anything you\u2019re not willing to give, because, fortunately, I know exactly what you want.\u201d The arrogant proclamation was so typically Dante that it took everything she had not to chuck something at him.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think either of us tried very hard to resist temptation today,\u201d she said, and he nodded his agreement. \u201cBut I want you to know that as of this very moment, this thing between us is over, and if I\u2019m really not here to simply service you while it\u2019s convenient, then prove it by allowing me to start at Mr. Whitman\u2019s office tomorrow, sir.\u201d</p><p>He took an excruciatingly long moment to respond. He straightened his tie and ran a hand through his hair, making it worse. He reached for his desk phone and dialed.</p><p>\u201cWhitman,\u201d he barked into the mouthpiece after a moment, keeping his eyes glued to hers. \u201cMiss Knight will be starting in your office tomorrow morning. Have your current secretary show her the ropes.\u201d</p><p>He hung up without so much as a good-bye, still holding her gaze captive.</p><p>\u201cHappy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rest of your day will be spent finding an adequate replacement for Donna, someone who will last the entire six months. Look in-house, but if that doesn\u2019t work, call a temp agency. You do not leave this office today until you have someone to replace you tomorrow. Entender? If she\u2019s incompetent, you\u2019ll be answerable for that.\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow at his staccato commands.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>She finally managed to lever herself out of the chair, their conversation having killed any residual desire she might have felt toward him. It wasn\u2019t exactly sexy to go from the most intense and intimate lovemaking experience of her life directly back to discussions about nondisclosure agreements, office dynamics, and displays of colossal male ego. Thankfully, it seemed to have had the same effect on him. She had just reached the door when his voice stopped her.</p><p>\u201cMiss Knight.\u201d</p> <p>She paused, her hand on the doorknob. She didn\u2019t turn to face him, merely waited for him to say whatever was left to say.</p><p>\u201cI would prefer someone older. Someone less like you.\u201d</p><p>Now what the hell did that mean? Someone less like her?</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he said lamely when she turned to face him quizzically. To his credit he looked as confused as she felt.</p><p>\u201cNope. Don\u2019t have a clue.\u201d Her voice was so icy that her words practically froze as they left her lips.</p><p>\u201cSomeone with more experience. With less personality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talk too much,\u201d he said pointedly. \u201cYour attitude is too familiar and too sarcastic.\u201d</p> <p>She opened her mouth to say something, and he held up a finger to stop her.</p><p>\u201cAnd that was before everything that happened in Tokyo. You\u2019re completely irreverent and have a bizarre sense of humor. I also have no wish to hear about reality television shows, pop music, manicures, Brangelina, Star Trek, or anything that\u2019s trending on Twitter\u2014not even secondhand through whispered telephone conversations when my assistant thinks I\u2019m not paying attention.\u201d</p><p>Well, he\u2019d certainly been a lot more attentive during those half hours in the mornings than she\u2019d given him credit for. But one thing struck her as odd.</p><p>\u201cStar Trek?\u201d she repeated. She loved the new movies but hardly ever publicly discussed them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re constantly talking about how sick you are of the Cardassians,\u201d he elaborated uncomfortably. Her eyes widened and she stifled a laugh.</p><p>\u201cDifferent kind of Kardashian,\u201d she corrected. It would be hopeless to explain it to a man who clearly had no interest in pop culture\u2014even while every model or actress he was publicly photographed with inserted him into the very scene he was so scornful of. Quite frankly, she was impressed that he even knew about the Cardassians in Star Trek, which attested to a level of geekdom that she would never have suspected of him.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re looking for the anti-me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be so hard to find the complete opposite of you. You are quite . . .\u201d His brow lowered as he tried to find the correct word. \u201cSingular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, ridiculously flattered until a closer glance at his straight face told her that it hadn\u2019t been a compliment. Her fledgling smile died, and she once again\u2014as she often did in his presence\u2014fought the urge to roll her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so you\u2019re looking for an old, boring, and competent assistant,\u201d she itemized, and his lips thinned but he said nothing. \u201cI\u2019ll get on that right away, sir.\u201d</p><p>The hot sex of earlier was all but forgotten beneath the surge of dislike and irritation she currently felt. She was determined to find him the best assistant she could because she would be perfectly happy never to see him again.</p><p>Dante watched her leave, waiting for the door to swing shut behind that tight little ass before throwing his head back against the chair and groaning. What the hell had he been thinking? Fucking her in the office was completely unacceptable and\u2014for him\u2014completely unprecedented. He had been so cool and collected when she\u2019d walked into his office that morning, but all the excruciatingly polite sirs had started to annoy him, and then when she\u2019d brought his coffee and mail around the desk, she\u2019d smelled fantastic\u2014her shampoo, soap, perfume, and her unique musk had combined into an irresistible cocktail designed to lead a man straight into temptation. Added to that, her skirt clung to her every curve, and that soft blouse draped over the barely there mounds of her breasts\u2014he had gone from zero to rock hard in less than thirty seconds. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Impulse control had gone straight out the window, and he had bent her over his desk and had lost complete control right there in a place that should have been sacrosanct. No personal complications had ever dared intrude in here before. Now he would never again look at his desk without picturing her bent over it, legs spread, skirt up over her back and adorable little panties down around her knees. He groaned again and stared down at his ridiculously keen cock, which once again stood at attention, begging for more.</p><p>\u201cNever going to happen again,\u201d he said out loud. Asking her to find an assistant by the end of the day was nearly an impossible request, considering his exacting standards, but really anybody would be better than Cleo right now. He just didn\u2019t trust his ability to stick to his resolve not to touch her again if she was working in close proximity to him. He knew this weakness was only because he hadn\u2019t gotten her out of his system yet, and they should probably allow this thing to run its course between them\u2014but he also knew that if he went cold turkey, it wouldn\u2019t take long to forget about her. She wasn\u2019t irresistible, just the flavor du jour, so to speak. She was there, he was horny, and they were good together . . . when they weren\u2019t forced to make conversation.</p><p>But it was over now. Time to move on.</p><p>Cleo found Dante\u2019s \u201cold, boring, and competent\u201d new executive assistant with time to spare that day. Mrs. Clarke was a kind middle-aged woman with a sharp intellect and frighteningly exacting standards. Cleo unashamedly lured her to the Dark Side from her nice, safe position as personal assistant to the accounts manager with the promise of a flattering introduction to the middle-aged and supposed lifelong bachelor Mr. Peter Whitman, to whom, it seemed, the widowed Mrs. Clarke had taken a shine. After that it had just been a matter of stepping back and watching Mrs. Clarke do her thing. The woman very quickly arranged a competent replacement to fill her own position for the next six months, managed her own immediate superior beautifully (the man seemed a little frightened of her, to be honest), and then all that was left was introducing her to Dante.</p> <p>Dante, however, proved to be frustratingly elusive for the rest of the day. He had left the office soon after their ill-advised little liaison that morning and hadn\u2019t returned. His phone kept going to voice mail, and he wasn\u2019t responding to any of his messages. By the end of the day, she shrugged, leaving him a succinct memo detailing the pertinent facts regarding Mrs. Clarke\u2019s temporary transfer from accounts to his office.</p><p>A quick glance around confirmed that she hadn\u2019t forgotten anything, and with not even a twinge of regret, she powered down her computer, gathered up her things, and left.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>\u201cDante, my man, you\u2019ve been scarce. I figured you were probably busy after your trip to Tokyo last month.\u201d Dante grimaced, keeping the phone pinned to his ear and grateful that his longtime friend couldn\u2019t see the guilt on his face. Being busy had nothing to do with the reason Dante had been scarce.</p><p>\u201cLucius, great to hear your voice. I\u2019ve been thinking about you.\u201d Not a lie. He had been thinking of the man, wondering if Cleo had let anything slip about what had happened between them. In truth, he\u2019d been a little reluctant to call his friend because he\u2019d feared that the other man\u2019s reception would be cool or hostile. And that would have been . . . disappointing. He enjoyed Luc\u2019s companionship. He didn\u2019t have many other friends to do \u201cguy\u201d things with, and even though he and Luc came from completely disparate backgrounds, they\u2019d become fast friends.</p> <p>While they rarely saw each other these days, Dante still valued the friendship they\u2019d forged in college when Dante had been new to the country. Most of the other so-called new friends he\u2019d made in that first year had started hitting him up for loans, making him pay for drinks and food almost immediately upon discovering that his family was one of the wealthiest old families in Spain, and if not for Luc\u2019s undemanding, steady friendship, Dante would probably have become a complete recluse.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Have you been thinking about that beer you owe me?\u201d Luc asked, his voice alive with humor. Dante\u2019s brow lowered.</p><p>\u201cBeer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRugby match, two months ago?\u201d Luc prompted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re actually serious? I know nothing about rugby. I never stood a chance of winning that bet, and you knew it,\u201d Dante protested, grinning like a kid. He was just so damned relieved everything seemed normal with Luc, and if Cleo kept her end of their agreement, it would remain that way.</p><p>\u201cEasy pickings,\u201d Luc agreed smugly. \u201cBut you should never have taken me up on it. Look, come over for dinner tonight, and we can watch the La Liga game afterward. Barcelona versus Real Madrid. You bring the beer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBlue doing the cooking?\u201d The woman was a fantastic cook.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s a deal.\u201d Football, food, beer, and a good friend with whom to enjoy it all. Dante couldn\u2019t think of a better way to spend the evening.</p><p>\u201cSo, do you enjoy life in the HR department?\u201d Blue asked Cleo, efficiently chopping up onions and peppers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been a month, but I\u2019m finding it quite rewarding. I\u2019m learning a lot.\u201d Cleo sat at the ancient kitchen table as she watched her brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e slice and dice her way through the dinner preparations. Blue was incredibly efficient at cooking. She was efficient at a lot of things, but Cleo\u2014who was useless at cooking\u2014particularly envied the other woman\u2019s prowess in the kitchen. She had popped into the ramshackle, sprawling old Knight family home in Hout Bay after work, hoping to score an invitation to dinner. She\u2019d been feeling a bit under the weather lately and hoped that some of Blue\u2019s good home cooking would help her feel better. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had timed it just right. Luc wasn\u2019t home from work yet, and Blue had just started with the dinner preparation.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you could build a career out of it?\u201d Blue asked as she scraped the diced onions, peppers, and garlic into a pot. They immediately sizzled as they hit the hot oil at the bottom of the pot, filling the kitchen with a delicious aroma.</p><p>Cleo fiddled with the handle of the coffee mug in front of her while contemplating the hot chocolate swirling around inside.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I was hoping . . .\u201d</p> <p>Blue glanced at her sharply when her voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cCleo,\u201d she said softly, ever perceptive, \u201cit\u2019s been three years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but every time I go to the dance studio and put on my pointe shoes, I feel like it\u2019s still in there, like I can still dance the way I used to. I keep thinking if I stay fit and keep dancing, keep doing my pointe routines, just keep going, I\u2019ll wake up one morning and just know that it\u2019s back. But with this job . . . there\u2019s not enough time to spend on my dancing. I have to devote my attention to either the job or dancing. I can\u2019t do both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can dance in your spare time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a hobby, you mean?\u201d</p> <p>Blue hesitated, before nodding, and Cleo ignored the stab of pain in her chest as she thought about what her friend had said.</p><p>\u201cThat would mean giving up on the only real dream I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Blue said nothing for a long time, keeping her hands busy and her eyes averted as she began meticulously peeling potatoes. \u201cCleo, maybe it\u2019s time to find another dream?\u201d Blue finally whispered, and Cleo\u2019s heart stuttered in her chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d Cleo asked, changing the subject clumsily.</p><p>\u201cNothing fancy, just beef stew and mashed potatoes, with bread pudding and custard for dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, perfect for a cold, rainy day,\u201d Cleo enthused, eyeing the buckets collecting water in the corner. The damned roof leaked like a sieve, and Luc had already set aside some money to have it fixed when the rain eventually stopped, which didn\u2019t seem like it would be anytime soon. The old house was right on the beach and had a rustic charm that could possibly have passed for shabby chic, if things were a little less shabby and a lot more chic. Its location made it prime property, but the fact that it had been in their family for generations turned it into a burden that desperately needed fixing up. Cleo was a lot less sentimental than Luc and had urged him to sell it, since he couldn\u2019t afford to get married with the damned thing hanging around his neck like an albatross\u2014but her brother had a little more respect for familial obligations than Cleo did.</p> <p>\u201cAre you staying for dinner?\u201d Blue asked, and Cleo brightened at the invitation she\u2019d been hoping for.</p><p>\u201cFor your gorgeous beef stew and pud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really plain fare. If I\u2019d known Luc was going to be asking Dante around for dinner, I would have planned something with a little more flair. He\u2019s not exactly the type of guy you serve beef stew to. Although, he\u2019s not at all a snob, is he? The last time he came around to dinner, he schooled your brother in proper manners and cleaned up the kitchen after we ate. He even helped me fix dessert. Seemed to enjoy it, really.\u201d</p><p>Cleo hadn\u2019t heard anything beyond the revelation that Dante Damaso was coming around for dinner and was immediately thankful that she hadn\u2019t already agreed to stay for the meal.</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks for the invitation, Blue, but\u2014much as I\u2019d love to\u2014I really can\u2019t stay. I\u2019ve been feeling a little under the weather lately. I\u2019m worried I\u2019m coming down with something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you drove all this way. I thought . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in the area for . . . uh.\u201d She ground to a halt as she comprehended that there really was no good reason for her to be so far out of her way. \u201cWell, I wanted to see you. I haven\u2019t seen much of you since getting back from Tokyo, what with the job change and all. But I underestimated how ill I was feeling. I should go home and get into bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are your symptoms? Maybe I have something here that can help with them?\u201d Blue was a nurse and had first met Luc eight years before, while he\u2019d still been taking care of their ailing grandparents. Blue had been one of the junior nurses in the oncology ward, and while nothing romantic had flared between them at the time\u2014what with Luc being so preoccupied with the stress of having two extremely ill, elderly people to take care of\u2014he had appreciated the young nurse\u2019s kindness and concern. Their relationship had bloomed after the elderly couple had passed away.</p> <p>Luc was completely smitten with the tall, doe-eyed, caramel-skinned, brown-haired woman and had asked her to marry him a few years after they\u2019d started dating. But he wanted her to have a fantastic wedding, so the wedding date kept getting pushed back due to financial reasons. They\u2019d been engaged way too long, and while Blue was infinitely patient and understanding, Cleo sometimes wanted to give her brother a swift kick in the butt for being so stubborn on the matter of the house.</p><p>\u201cSome tummy issues and just general listlessness. Cal was sick last week, and I think I probably caught this from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then stay hydrated and eat as much broth as you can manage. And get a decent night\u2019s sleep tonight,\u201d Blue said, stepping into her caregiving role with complete ease. Cleo smiled warmly at the woman before nodding toward the pot sizzling away behind Blue.</p><p>\u201cYour onions are burning,\u201d she pointed out, and laughed when Blue swore and dashed for the pot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGive my brother a hug from me, and tell him I\u2019ll see him soon,\u201d Cleo instructed as she got up from the table, eager to leave before Dante and Luc showed up. How weird was it that after years of friendship between the two men, she\u2019d nearly run into him in their family home for the first time ever? Then again, before her accident, Cleo had hardly been a regular visitor to the house. She\u2019d always been miserable here. She hated how strict her grandparents had been, how she and Luc were never allowed out past seven on a weeknight and nine on a weekend, even when they were in their late teens. Luc had been the ever-obedient good boy, while Cleo had been a rebel\u2014receiving constant censure from their grandparents.</p><p>Cleo had left home as soon as she was eighteen and had moved in with a small commune of fellow dancers while attending the University of Cape Town School of Dance, earning the elderly couple\u2019s disapproval. Every time she visited home\u2014usually at Luc\u2019s behest\u2014she had always wound up arguing with her grandparents, so she regularly made excuses not to visit. Which was something she would regret for the rest of her life.</p><p>Cleo moved to hug Blue, who was still cursing over her charred onions, and made her escape before the other woman could offer any further protest.</p><p>Dante parked his Jaguar in front of his friend\u2019s huge, rather creepy old house at exactly the same time as Luc drove up in his serviceable old Ford sedan. He felt his lips settle into a relaxed grin as he caught the other man\u2019s eye. Luc\u2019s face lit up with a huge smile as he got out of his car and rounded the trunk to greet Dante as he leisurely climbed out of his own car.</p> <p>\u201cHey, howzit?\u201d Luc called, and grabbed Dante\u2019s hand for a brief shake before tugging him in for a one-armed hug. \u201cGood to see you, Dan. Ready for tonight\u2019s match? Barcelona\u2019s going to wipe the floor with Real Madrid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, amigo, stick to rugby; you clearly know nothing about soccer.\u201d Dante laughed dismissively at Luc\u2019s\u2014frankly ludicrous\u2014prediction, and just like that it was as if they\u2019d seen each other only yesterday.</p><p>Their banter continued all the way into the house and then into the kitchen, where Luc greeted his gorgeous fianc\u00e9e with a sweeping kiss, and Dante followed it up with an only slightly less sweeping kiss. This was the closest thing he had to a proper home in this country, and he\u2019d always guarded these relationships jealously. The knowledge that he\u2019d nearly completely fucked it up with everything that had happened with Cleo was chilling, and he considered himself lucky that he\u2019d managed to get through that entire sordid situation with this important friendship still intact.</p><p>Beer in hand, he settled back, ready to enjoy his meal and the companionship for the rest of the evening.</p><p>\u201cSo what the hell has been going on with you lately?\u201d Luc demanded of Cleo a month after she had narrowly escaped running into Dante Damaso in this very house. Thankfully she hadn\u2019t seen the man at all since then. \u201cWe\u2019ve hardly seen you since your return from Tokyo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy with work, and I can\u2019t seem to shake this damned bug. I feel like I\u2019ve been sick forever,\u201d she groused. They were having dinner around the kitchen table, and delicious though it was, Cleo was having a hard time keeping it down.</p><p>\u201cYou do look a little paler than usual,\u201d Luc said, concerned.</p><p>\u201cDo you have to say \u2018than usual\u2019? You make me sound like Morticia or a zombie or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s definitely looking a bit vampirical, isn\u2019t she, babe?\u201d he asked Blue, who nodded somberly despite the laughter dancing in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIs \u2018vampirical\u2019 even a word?\u201d Cleo scoffed.</p><p>\u201cIf it isn\u2019t, then it should be.\u201d Luc shrugged.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just tired and a little depressed because it just never stops raining.\u201d They all simultaneously glanced at the ever-present bucket in one corner of the room, which was rapidly filling with water. It had been raining almost nonstop for nearly a week now, and aside from being depressing and cold, it had caused floods, accidents, and illness. Cleo couldn\u2019t remember any other winter being this desperately grim before.</p><p>\u201cIs this still the same bug as last month?\u201d Blue asked, her pretty brown eyes warming with concern, and Cleo nodded.</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s so irritating. It\u2019s nothing serious, just a dodgy stomach and a bit of dizziness. It comes and goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a stomach bug going around,\u201d Blue said. \u201cYou can consider yourself lucky if all you\u2019re suffering from is dizziness and a bit of nausea. We\u2019ve practically been swimming in vomit at the office this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Blue.\u201d Luc grimaced, and she grinned unrepentantly. She\u2019d left the hospital a couple of years before and now worked for a private practitioner. The job offered better hours and a much better salary.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Blue grinned, and Luc rolled his eyes, unable to even pretend to be mad at her when she flashed those dimples at him.</p><p>\u201cWell you have lost some weight over this past month.\u201d Blue was all seriousness again as she gave Cleo a critical once-over. \u201cWeight that you can\u2019t really afford to lose. Have you been throwing up a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, I\u2019m done.\u201d Luc tossed aside his napkin and got up, collecting his and Blue\u2019s empty plates along the way and dumping them in the sink.</p> <p>\u201cNot that much,\u201d Cleo said, ignoring her brother, who was pointedly clearing the table and piling more dishes in the sink. \u201cJust a couple of times a day, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeadaches? Fever?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cleo shook her head. Blue gave her a speculative look before glancing over at Luc, who was now doing the dishes.</p><p>\u201cHey, I wanted your opinion on this dress I bought the other day.\u201d Blue changed the subject abruptly, and Cleo raised her eyebrows in surprise. Luc glanced up.</p><p>\u201cWhat dress?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise. You don\u2019t get to see it until our anniversary dinner next week.\u201d She gave him a sexy little look over her shoulder, and he practically frothed at the mouth in response. Which was an exchange Cleo would rather not have witnessed. Blue grabbed Cleo\u2019s hand and dragged her from the kitchen, up the creaking staircase, only to let go once they were in her and Luc\u2019s huge bedroom, which was also filled with brimming buckets and pots. She shut the door firmly behind them.</p> <p>\u201cThis better be one hell of a dress, Blue,\u201d Cleo warned, rubbing at her shoulder. \u201cI think you\u2019ve just about dislocated my shoulder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind the dress.\u201d Blue waved her hand dismissively. \u201cHow do you feel after the dinner we just had? Any nausea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot right now,\u201d she replied, still massaging her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAny other tummy issues? Maybe down at the other end?</p><p>\u201cGross. No.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo fever, no headaches, just nausea and dizziness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, is there some delayed echo in here?\u201d Cleo asked sarcastically, and Blue glared at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working up to something here, okay?\u201d she hissed. \u201cLet me do my thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet to the point, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine! But don\u2019t snap my head off when I ask my next question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you\u2019re so dramatic,\u201d Cleo teased. \u201cHow did my practical brother wind up with such a drama queen? Just ask the question.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen was your last period?\u201d</p><p>All thought fled Cleo\u2019s mind as her knees buckled and she sank down onto the bed. Blue\u2019s question hit her like a ton of bricks, and she finally understood what her friend was leading up to.</p><p>She did some frantic calculations and came to the realization that she couldn\u2019t even remember when she\u2019d last had her period! She\u2019d been so preoccupied with the new job, her weird illness, and the fact that she stupidly missed seeing Dante Damaso more than she had ever expected. Dante bloody Damaso, who may well have knocked her up!</p><p>\u201cCleo? Is it possible that you\u2019re pregnant?\u201d Blue asked quietly, and Cleo raised a hand to her mouth, her eyes wide with absolute fear.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut not likely. I mean, we used condoms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not a hundred percent effective,\u201d Blue murmured, and sat down beside Cleo to wrap an arm around her narrow shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s just a theory. You could still just have a stomach bug.\u201d</p><p>No, now that Blue had raised the possibility, Cleo didn\u2019t see it being anything else.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had my period in a while,\u201d she confessed.</p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking . . .\u201d Oh, Cleo knew what was coming next and braced herself for it. \u201cIf you are pregnant, who\u2019s the father? You haven\u2019t been dating anyone. Have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not important,\u201d she whispered. God, she felt completely sick. \u201cIf I am . . . if there is\u2014\u201d She shook her head, unable to formulate the words. \u201cHe won\u2019t be involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Blue said after a moment, \u201cbefore we get ahead of ourselves, we should probably confirm that you\u2019re actually pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Cleo whispered. She felt . . . numb, with an underlying sense of dread and confusion. How was she supposed to cope with this? She would make a terrible mother. She would be a complete failure at it, just like her own mother had been. And to do it on her own, without a partner to support her . . . she would totally mess up the kid.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Blue,\u201d she finally said, a sob escaping from behind the hand over her mouth. \u201cHow can I be a mother? How do I support a baby? What if I forget to feed it? Or if it gets sick and I can\u2019t tell that something\u2019s wrong? My salary only barely covers the rent and food for the month. How will I afford nappies and clothes and other baby stuff? Babies need a lot of stuff, don\u2019t they?\u201d She could hear her voice rising hysterically with each question, and Blue\u2019s other arm came up to enclose her in a warm and comforting hug.</p><p>\u201cSsh, Cleo. Let\u2019s get you to a doctor first and confirm the pregnancy, then we\u2019ll start worrying about everything else. You have options, but you don\u2019t have to think about them right now, okay? For now, just take a deep breath and relax. Everything will be fine.\u201d</p><p>Cleo buried her face in Blue\u2019s neck and wept, desperately wanting to believe that comforting bit of fiction despite knowing that nothing would ever be fine again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell Luc, okay?\u201d she requested in a small, shuddery voice. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Blue promised. \u201cIt\u2019s not my place to tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going to have to buy a dress for your anniversary dinner now,\u201d she apologized miserably.</p><p>\u201cSince when is it a hardship to buy a new dress?\u201d Blue quipped, but Cleo knew that Blue and Luc were both pinching pennies to save for the wedding. She gave Blue a look, not wanting to state the obvious, but Blue merely smiled and hugged her again.</p><p>\u201cGo and wash your face so that your brother won\u2019t see that you\u2019ve been crying, okay? And for my own peace of mind, I\u2019d prefer it if you slept over here tonight. I don\u2019t want you driving in the state you\u2019re in. Not when it\u2019s pouring outside and the roads are like rivers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cleo nodded, allowing her future sister-in-law to boss her into the bathroom and into a warm shower. She was waiting when Cleo stepped out of the bathroom fifteen minutes\u2014and a good cry\u2014later, with warm, fuzzy pajamas that were too large for Cleo.</p><p>\u201cI told Luc you\u2019re staying because you aren\u2019t feeling too well and that you were headed straight to bed, so you don\u2019t have to face him again tonight.\u201d Cleo hugged the other woman tightly, overwhelmed with love and gratitude.</p><p>\u201cI love you, sis,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish my brother would hurry up and marry you already.\u201d</p><p>Blue planted a kiss on Cleo\u2019s head.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll happen,\u201d she said with a sweet smile. \u201cNow off to bed with you.\u201d</p><p>Cleo had difficulty sleeping that night. Her mind was racing with a million and one different scenarios. There was absolutely no doubt in her mind that she was pregnant, and like Blue said, she had options: she could give the baby up for adoption or she could terminate the pregnancy or she could work throughout her pregnancy and save enough money to help her during the first few months of motherhood until she was ready to go back to work. She could move in with Blue and Luc, who would undoubtedly welcome her with open arms. Then there was that other possibility . . .</p><p>She could tell Dante.</p><p>She would rather eat worms than tell Dante Damaso.</p><p>But since this baby was half his, surely he had a right to know about it? And it wasn\u2019t her fault his stupid condoms had failed and he happened to have champion swimmers, was it? Why should she be the only one worrying about this? Why should she give up her baby? Or get rid of her baby or beg her brother for help when its father was more than capable of supporting it?</p> <p>But seriously . . . she would rather eat worms than tell Dante.</p><p>It was on that troubled note that she finally fell into a fitful sleep.</p><p>Cleo called in sick the following day and drifted listlessly around the empty house for part of the morning, battling the familiar nausea she now dreaded. Once she\u2019d managed to get the vomiting under control, she climbed into her battered old Volkswagen hatchback and headed home for a shower and change of clothes. She would be meeting Blue in Three Anchor Bay\u2014close to where the other woman worked\u2014later in the afternoon, where they would be going to an OB/GYN.</p><p>When she stepped into the tiny flat she shared with Cal in Newlands, her slender shoulders drooped beneath the crushing weight of depression. A quick glance around was enough to nearly send her to her knees in despair. How could she bring a baby into this place? It was a tiny one-bedroom flat with an open-plan kitchen and living room. Cal slept in the living room, but he never bothered to put away the bedding, and the sleeper couch was strewn with his clothing. There were empty takeout cartons scattered about; the half-eaten bowl of popcorn she\u2019d made for a movie three nights ago still stood on the coffee table where she\u2019d left it. The sink was piled high with dishes, and the place smelled stale and a little damp.</p><p>Cal wasn\u2019t home and she hoped he was out job hunting if he wasn\u2019t auditioning somewhere. She knew an audition was probably highly unlikely because, knowing Cal, he would have been talking about it for days before it actually happened. But Cal had developed a reputation within their small dancing community of being problematic. It was getting harder and harder for him to dance with independent groups because word had gotten around about him. He\u2019d once had a position with a contemporary dance troupe and blew it when, after one lead, he started making impossible demands. Cleo wished that he would stop sabotaging himself, but it was difficult to talk to him about the situation. He got ridiculously defensive and would storm off in a sulk for hours\u2014sometimes days\u2014on end.</p><p>Cleo sighed, not in the mood to further speculate about her roommate\u2019s possible whereabouts, and wearily made her way into her tiny bedroom. It was a total wreck. The bed was unmade and buried beneath a mound of clothing; her wardrobe was open, with even more clothes spilling out of it. At least there were no weeks-old cartons of food in here; Cleo never ate in her bedroom.</p> <p>She pushed some of the clothing aside and sank down into the space she\u2019d just created, buried her face in her hands, and cried for what seemed like the hundredth time in the past twenty-four hours. After getting it out of her system, she trudged to the bathroom for her shower, determined to be a little less mopey. She probably wasn\u2019t pregnant and her period was just late, due any day now, which would explain the mood swings and the weird bouts of crying.</p><p>Just PMS, that was all.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re definitely pregnant.\u201d Cleo stared at the OB/GYN in dismay, her hand gripping Blue\u2019s so tightly it actually hurt. \u201cEarly days yet, just heading into the eighth week, I\u2019d say. That would place the delivery date somewhere in March. Sound about right to you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded dumbly, her eyes blurring, and Dr. Klein\u2019s gaze sharpened.</p><p>\u201cI take it this news is . . . unexpected?\u201d When Cleo nodded again, the doctor reached into her desk drawer, removed a few colorful pamphlets, and handed them over to Cleo. \u201cThen you undoubtedly have a great deal to consider. You have options ranging from adoption to termination. Should you decide to keep the baby, there are single-mother support groups, which would help you feel less alone. In the meantime, until you decide what to do, you have to take care of yourself. Prenatal vitamins are essential, and so is the correct diet. You\u2019re quite small and definitely underweight. I want you to start eating three meals a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would if I didn\u2019t keep throwing up at random times,\u201d Cleo muttered bitterly, and the doctor smiled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMorning sickness can be exceedingly draining,\u201d the doctor said sympathetically. \u201cEat slowly. A few crackers can work wonders. There are a few effective methods to reduce the nausea, which are covered in one of the pamphlets I gave you. If natural remedies don\u2019t work to alleviate the symptoms and the nausea is persistent throughout the day, come back and I\u2019ll prescribe a safe antiemetic. Don\u2019t purchase over-the-counter medicines, as they can be harmful to the baby.\u201d The doctor rambled on for a bit longer, talking about the changes Cleo could expect in her body, suggesting reading material, and finally warning that if she opted for termination of the pregnancy, she shouldn\u2019t wait too long.</p><p>The doctor eventually stopped talking long enough to give Cleo a very thorough physical exam, with a urine check, blood test, a PAP smear, and so many other invasive little pokes and prods that Cleo eventually stopped listening to the doctor\u2019s explanations about what she was doing and why. She just wanted to go home and pretend this day had never happened.</p><p>When the lengthy prenatal exam ended, the doctor sat them down once again.</p><p>\u201cVivian, my receptionist, will schedule your next appointment\u2014we\u2019ll do a dating ultrasound just to make sure we have an accurate idea of the baby\u2019s due date. After that ultrasound, I\u2019ll expect to see you once a month,\u201d she said. \u201cBut once you\u2019ve recovered a little from the shock, please consider contacting one of those single-mother groups I spoke about earlier. It could help you with your decision making.\u201d</p> <p>Cleo kept her eyes on her plate throughout the late lunch Blue had dragged her to. She was vaguely aware of Blue calling her boss to say that she would be late back to the office, and Cleo felt a pang of guilt for keeping the woman away from her work. But at the same time she felt wholly incapable of functioning in any normal capacity.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d she whispered, after half an hour of staring at her healthy green salad going limp in its bowl. Blue reached across the table and gave her hand a reassuring squeeze.</p><p>\u201cLuc and I will always be here for you, Cleo,\u201d she said, and Cleo groaned.</p><p>\u201cLuc is going to be so disappointed.\u201d Her brother loved her and would support her through whatever decision she made, but he would want more for her than this. Twenty-seven years old and accidentally pregnant? This was what they would have expected from her during her rebellious teen phase, not now that she was finally getting her life sorted out. Despite still desperately clinging to her dancing, she did enjoy her new job\u2014she found it challenging and interesting. Mr. Whitman was worlds away from Dante as a boss, and he was happy to train her as they went along. He was also exceedingly grateful for the introduction to Mrs. Clarke. The two had now been on three dates and were already talking about the next one.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t seen or heard from Dante Damaso since that last day in his office. Well . . . she had seen and heard of him. Seen him in magazines and newspapers with a different leggy beauty on his arm in every picture, and heard chatter about him around the office. But it was like she had never really known him, never spent hours in his bed, never experienced absolute sexual bliss in his arms. It had started to take on a fairy-tale, dreamlike quality in her mind, like it hadn\u2019t really happened, but now this baby proved it had happened and it had very real consequences.</p> <p>\u201cSo the dad is definitely out of the picture?\u201d Blue asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cVery much so,\u201d Cleo responded in a voice that encouraged no further questions. But Blue had known her too long to be put off.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell him about the baby?\u201d she pushed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It depends on whether I decide to keep it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you don\u2019t want it, he might,\u201d Blue pointed out. Cleo considered that for a moment before thinking about Dante\u2019s jet-setting lifestyle and the constant stream of women parading through his life, and knew that the last thing he would want was a baby to cramp his style.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t want it,\u201d Cleo said definitively.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, he and I may not have been serious, but I know him better than you do, Blue. He won\u2019t want this baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo which decision are you leaning toward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Cleo admitted miserably. \u201cI just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still have some time to think about it, Cleo,\u201d Blue murmured. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to decide right at this moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel so stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was an accident. These things happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo teenagers, not to grown women who should have their crap together by now. I\u2019ve failed at everything else, Blue. Imagine how spectacularly I\u2019d fail at motherhood. This poor baby doesn\u2019t stand a chance with me as its mother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s nonsense,\u201d Blue dismissed, showing rare signs of anger. \u201cYou\u2019re kind, considerate, loving, generous with your affection, and while things haven\u2019t always gone your way, you found ways to cope. You have always bounced back and found a way forward. You\u2019ll do the same this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been completely directionless since I stopped dancing,\u201d Cleo confessed quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve felt so lost and I\u2019ve tried to hide it, but even though it has been years, I still haven\u2019t found anything to fill the void it left in my life. I\u2019ve even considered becoming a dance instructor, but I don\u2019t know if I can stand to teach others to do what I no longer can. How pathetic is that? To think that I could be jealous or resentful of some talented young dancer just because I lost my opportunity to be the best at it. It makes me feel petty and small and ugly. How could I ever be a good teacher if I don\u2019t want my students to soar higher than I did?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCleo, I love you, but sometimes you frustrate me so much,\u201d Blue said. \u201cI can\u2019t talk to you when you\u2019re in this mood. I can\u2019t listen to you beat yourself up over things that are completely beyond your control. Eat your lunch and tell me how the living situation with Cal is going.\u201d</p><p>Cleo grimaced, the change in subject adding to her depression.</p><p>\u201cThat bad, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes it\u2019s so draining to have him around.\u201d And it would be worse now with all this on her plate. His self-centeredness was so frustrating. He hadn\u2019t even noticed how ill she\u2019d been feeling recently. Cleo knew that she had once been as egocentric as Cal and was grateful that she had developed enough self-awareness to appreciate that the world did not revolve around her. Cal, at thirty-two, had still not come to that realization, and Cleo doubted he ever would.</p> <p>\u201cHave you considered asking him to move out?\u201d Blue asked tactfully.</p><p>\u201cHe has nowhere else to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCleo, sometimes you have to think of your own needs,\u201d Blue pointed out, and Cleo scoffed.</p><p>\u201cI spent most of my life being selfish and thinking of my own needs, to the detriment of others. When I look back on how I was, how much I took my grandparents and Luc and everything they sacrificed for me for granted, I\u2019m so ashamed. When you met Luc, he was taking care of my grandparents 24-7, he only ever took time for his studies. He used to beg me to come home, to come and visit my grandparents.\u201d Cleo kept her eyes downcast as she spoke. She knew that Blue had probably heard all of this from Luc, but knowing her brother, he had sugarcoated the facts, and right now, Cleo wanted her friend to hear the ugly, unadorned truth about her. \u201cAnd I never did. I was always too busy, having too much fun, practicing too hard. I made excuses not to visit because I didn\u2019t want to deal with their constant disapproval. I always felt like nothing I did was right.</p><p>\u201cSo I stayed away and left Luc to deal with it all, and only toward the end did I finally relent and visit them.\u201d She choked back a sob. \u201cAnd they were so old and so obviously dying, but they were so grateful.\u201d Her voice broke on the word as tears seeped down her cheeks and dripped into her salad. \u201cJust so grateful and happy that I\u2019d come to visit them. There were no recriminations, only warmth and love and pure happiness. And I felt like such an imposter: their beautiful little ballerina who was so ugly on the inside. All those years I spent resenting them when all they ever wanted was my happiness. I can\u2019t go back to being that awful person. Cal did a lot for me after my accident, and I won\u2019t turn my back on him when he needs me.\u201d</p> <p>Blue reached out to squeeze Cleo\u2019s hands. They were silent for a while, Blue patiently waiting for Cleo to gather herself before changing the subject to her and Luc\u2019s upcoming anniversary, and about the dress she was thinking of buying. It was a welcome change in topic, but it didn\u2019t take Cleo\u2019s mind completely off her problems.</p><p>After Cleo returned home, she went into her bedroom, pushed the pile of clothing off the bed, and curled up in the center of it, trying to make herself as small as possible. She placed her palm over the flat expanse of her abdomen and gently applied pressure, trying to feel this tiny presence, which had made such a huge impact on her life. She felt nothing and it was hard to imagine anything in there, yet it was there. It existed.</p><p>At nearly eight weeks\u2014according to the literature Dr. Klein had given her\u2014it was smaller than a kidney bean but was developing tiny little webbed fingers and toes and eyelids. It was alive and moving even if she couldn\u2019t feel it. She lifted her hands to her face and found it wet with tears. Her baby was alive and it needed her. It depended on her for food, for oxygen, for its very existence, and she couldn\u2019t make the decision to snuff out that tiny life.</p><p>And just like that, terminating the pregnancy was no longer an option.</p><p>If she were younger, who knows what her decision would have been. But she was twenty-seven and\u2014despite all her dreams to the contrary\u2014realistically speaking, she didn\u2019t have a dance career to think of anymore, and she was no longer the same selfish Cleo she had been years ago. She still didn\u2019t know if she would keep it or put it up for adoption, but now that the immediate decision of having or terminating had been taken care of, the pressure of making any other urgent decisions had been relieved a bit. She had time to figure that out. She still didn\u2019t think she would make a good mother, but there were so many other women out there who would die for the opportunity to have a baby to love and take care of.</p><p>Cleo fell asleep clinging to that positive thought.</p> <p>When she woke up a couple of hours later, it was early evening, and the light was starting to go. Cleo immediately called Blue and told her that she planned to have the baby.</p><p>\u201cI know it couldn\u2019t have been an easy decision to make, but Luc, your friends, and I are all here for you.\u201d Blue\u2019s warm voice washed over her, soothing her and making her feel so much better about the choice she\u2019d made.</p><p>\u201cHow do I tell Luc?\u201d Cleo wondered miserably.</p><p>\u201cYour brother will understand. He\u2019s not entirely unreasonable, you know?\u201d the other woman teased, and Cleo made a sound that was half laugh and half sob.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be gutted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming to see you guys; I think it\u2019s best to get this over and done with,\u201d Cleo decided.</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019ll come to you. I\u2019d just feel better if you weren\u2019t driving in these conditions while you\u2019re so distracted,\u201d Blue said firmly, and hung up before Cleo could protest.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She got up from bed slowly, alarmed when her head spun and her stomach roiled in protest at the movement.</p><p>\u201cMorning sickness, my butt,\u201d she muttered beneath her breath. The term was a complete misnomer. She sat quietly and breathed deeply to try and regain her equilibrium. When she felt steadier, she made her way to the door and peeked into the living room. Cal was sitting on the couch, making out with some guy Cleo had never seen before.</p><p>They didn\u2019t even notice when Cleo stepped into the room and only\u2014leisurely\u2014ended their kiss when she cleared her throat pointedly.</p><p>\u201cHi, hon,\u201d Cal greeted cheerfully. \u201cThis is the guy I told you about. Greg.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Greg, yes. Cal never stops talking about you,\u201d she lied. Greg\u2014a good-looking guy about ten years Cal\u2019s junior\u2014smiled sweetly. He had stars in his eyes as he looked at Cal. Poor kid.</p><p>Cleo turned toward the kitchen and was gratified to note that Cal had tidied up a bit while she was asleep, probably in anticipation of Greg\u2019s visit. Cal left Greg on the couch and joined Cleo in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHey, hon, I hope you don\u2019t mind us chilling here for the evening,\u201d he said casually, clearly not really concerned with Cleo\u2019s response. \u201cBut Greg still lives at home, so we couldn\u2019t hook up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lives at home? How old is he?\u201d She looked at Greg again and reevaluated her initial assessment of his age.</p><p>\u201cNineteen? Twenty? Something like that.\u201d Cal waved a dismissive hand. \u201cIsn\u2019t he adorable, though?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCal, he\u2019s a baby,\u201d Cleo hissed impatiently. She was getting a little fed up with her friend\u2019s casual hookups. \u201cWhen are you going to stop messing around with these little toy boys and find a decent\u2014age-appropriate\u2014guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAge-appropriate guys aren\u2019t fun and lack stamina,\u201d he whispered smugly. \u201cWhat Greg lacks in experience, he makes up for in enthusiasm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, you and young Greg are going to have to go someplace else tonight. I\u2019m expecting guests,\u201d she said, and Cal\u2019s eyebrows rose.</p><p>\u201cGuests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuc and Blue are coming,\u201d she explained, and Cal rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re hardly guests. They won\u2019t mind if Greg and I are hanging around.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCal, I have something really important to discuss with Luc; I just need a bit of privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when do you have secrets from me?\u201d he teased.</p><p>Cleo\u2019s patience just snapped. \u201cSince now, okay?\u201d</p><p>Cal took a step back and his face froze over.</p><p>\u201cNo need to lash out,\u201d he said icily. \u201cKeep your precious secrets. Greg, babe, we\u2019re going out. We\u2019re not welcome here.\u201d</p><p>The passive-aggressive comment was so typical of him.</p><p>\u201cCal,\u201d she said miserably, and he held up a hand, still not looking at her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Cleo. This is your flat, and you have every right to want it to yourself sometimes. I\u2019m sure Greg and I will find someplace to go in this weather. Right, babe?\u201d Greg\u2019s pretty blue eyes were wide and confused, but he nodded.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just for a couple of hours,\u201d she explained. \u201cI\u2019ll text you when they leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d He shrugged, grabbing his coat. She tried her best to shove aside the guilt as he and the hapless young Greg left. She really didn\u2019t need Cal\u2019s drama right now, but that\u2019s how he always was, and she continually made excuses for him.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the father?\u201d Luc asked. He had been grim and silent when Cleo told him about her pregnancy and had remained that way for nearly five minutes after she had stuttered to a halt. She had never seen her normally amicable brother so quiet and unreadable before. Blue had filled the silence with slightly nervous chatter about the weather and the new leaks they\u2019d discovered in the roof, all the while darting uncertain glances at Luc like he was a ticking time bomb about to go off. And now, when he finally spoke, his voice was cold enough to freeze the air around him.</p><p>\u201cHis identity is unimportant,\u201d Cleo said, trying to keep her voice from wobbling.</p><p>\u201cYou do know who the father is, right?\u201d The question was designed to wound, and Cleo felt the impact of it like a blow to her sternum. She gasped and folded in on herself defensively.</p><p>\u201cLucius Knight!\u201d Blue barked, angrier than Cleo had ever seen her before. \u201cYou should be ashamed of yourself.\u201d</p><p>To his credit, Luc looked immediately contrite.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cleo, that was unfair of me,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cI\u2019m just angry and frustrated. I hate to see you in a situation like this, with the loser who got you pregnant having zero accountability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my choice, Luc.\u201d</p><p>He nodded curtly, his jaw tight. He still looked angry and disappointed, and it killed her to have put that look on his face.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re having it but not sure if you\u2019re keeping it?\u201d he said after a long pause, during which he\u2019d done nothing but stare at her intently and stroke his thumbs restlessly across the back of her hands.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do you think you\u2019ll know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I have no feelings about this baby one way or another. I just feel trapped and confused and scared and so stupid right now.\u201d Her voice was thick with tears.</p><p>\u201cOh, Pattypan,\u201d Luc sighed, and dragged her into his arms for a comforting hug. The childhood nickname\u2014one he\u2019d come up with because she hated her full name\u2014brought tears to her eyes, and she sobbed into his chest, suddenly feeling years younger than her age. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure this out. I promise you that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cleo allowed herself to lean on him for a second longer, knowing that her big brother would always have her back. She had never loved or appreciated him more than in that moment.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>Cal was still pointedly ignoring her when he returned to the flat, sans Greg, much later that night.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Cleo greeted tentatively, even though she found his wounded air annoying.</p><p>\u201cOh. Hey,\u201d he replied, as if he\u2019d only just noticed her sitting on the lone chair in the living room, an overstuffed monstrosity that she\u2019d purchased at a thrift store.</p><p>\u201cSo . . . I\u2019m pregnant,\u201d she blurted, and he froze on his way to the bathroom. He turned to face her, his mouth gaping and his eyes just about popping out of his skull.</p><p>\u201cShut up. You\u2019re shitting me, right?\u201d He always got so American teen when he was surprised by something. It was equal parts endearing and exasperating. \u201cOh my God. No wonder you\u2019ve been such a bitch lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, thanks,\u201d she said with a grin. She couldn\u2019t help it; his irreverence and honesty always made her smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, you have.\u201d He forgot all about his need to go to the bathroom and sank down onto his sleeper couch opposite her chair. \u201cAre you keeping it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you thinking about terminating the pregnancy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about it, but decided against it. It\u2019s not a choice that sits well with me, not at this point in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d he said. \u201cSo adoption is still in the cards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you considered telling the da . . . Ohmygod, is Dante Damaso the father?\u201d His voice rose dramatically on the last syllable, and she winced.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should keep the kid and let baby daddy fork out loads to take care of you both,\u201d he said, as if she were crazy to even consider any other option.</p><p>\u201cYeah. No. I\u2019m not that mercenary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get pregnant deliberately?\u201d Cal asked pointedly.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. It was probably a stupid faulty condom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who, pray tell, took care of the condoms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you stressing about this? You didn\u2019t ask to get pregnant; this is as much his fault as it is yours\u2014more his than yours, in fact. You trusted him to take care of your protection. I mean, you could have caught all kinds of nasty diseases because of that one dodgy condom.\u201d Cal would be the one to think of gritty realities like that. But Cleo didn\u2019t think she\u2019d caught anything other than a bad case of pregnant from Dante\u2014the man was too fastidious.</p> <p>\u201cThe doctor tested for those today,\u201d she said listlessly, remembering Dr. Klein explaining what some of the blood draws were for. She wasn\u2019t particularly concerned that they would find anything untoward.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re going to be like those impractical chicks in the romance novels, all super strong and independent: \u2018I don\u2019t need no stinking man and his stinking money to take care of me and my stinking baby\u2019?\u201d Cal asked after a while. \u201cAnd while their men are rolling in dough, they\u2019re living in poverty\u2014because they\u2019re good girls and taking his money would seem greedy, right?\u201d</p><p>Cleo didn\u2019t respond. When Cal was off on a tangent, it was best to let it run its course.</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s just plain bollocks. The guy was there when this kid was made; he should damned well own up to that and help you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m keeping the baby,\u201d Cleo said weakly.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Just don\u2019t be a fool, Cleo. False pride never helped anybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I only learned about this pregnancy today, Cal,\u201d she said, exhausted. \u201cI need time to think about some things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and one of the things you need to think about is the fact that this baby\u2019s father isn\u2019t exactly impoverished, and if you wanted to keep it, there\u2019s no reason he couldn\u2019t support his child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d She held up a hand and rubbed her forehead with the other hand. She was developing a splitting headache. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed. Good night.\u201d</p><p>For the next couple of weeks, Cleo felt like someone who was swimming in ether. She couldn\u2019t get her head together. She felt like she was living in a weird otherworld where nothing made sense\u2014up was down, left was right, and she was carrying Dante Damaso\u2019s baby. She kept expecting to wake up and heave a huge sigh of relief because of the outrageous dream she\u2019d had, but that never happened. Every day she faced the same crazy reality. Worse, her pregnancy made itself felt in all the nastiest ways: constant morning sickness; a severe lack of energy; lack of sleep; bloating; tender, swollen breasts\u2014just about every symptom she\u2019d read about, she had. It was crazy, annoying, and more than a little unbearable.</p><p>Every Sunday night she picked up her secondhand copy of a handy week-to-week pregnancy guide she\u2019d bought at a bargain bookshop and read up on what she could expect over the next week. She found it fascinating how fast the baby was developing every week, but she found the changes in her body slightly less fascinating.</p><p>Cal was still pressuring her to tell Dante, while Blue and Luc\u2019s stoic refusal to ask about her decision had the opposite intended effect. She felt more pressured by their unwavering, silent support.</p><p>She put all of that out of her mind and focused on her book, wanting to see where the baby was this week. The most exciting news was that it should now have perfect little fingers with fingernails starting to grow in. Her hand rubbed her flat abdomen in wonder as she pictured those tiny fingers with their soft, brand-new little fingernails. If it was a girl, someday\u2014years from now\u2014she might take an interest in manicures and want pretty painted nails. If it was a boy, he might like working with his hands and getting dirt under those nails. Or maybe vice versa. Who knew? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cleo fell asleep thinking about those tiny perfect hands.</p><p>It was the fingernails that did it. Cleo could not stop thinking about them. She fell in love with those fingernails and their tiny fingers on their equally tiny hands. And over the course of the next week, she stopped thinking of it as \u201cthe baby.\u201d It had become \u201cmy baby.\u201d</p><p>It was a seemingly trifling change in thinking but it had major implications. The baby was now hers, and she couldn\u2019t imagine anyone else loving it or taking care of it. There was no longer a choice. She was keeping it.</p><p>And Dante was entitled to know about the baby.</p> <p>But first she would have to think about how she would go about this. She had to make it perfectly clear that his responsibility began and ended with the baby. She wanted what was best for her baby, and what was best was for the father to provide some kind of financial support. She wasn\u2019t looking for some huge payday, even though she knew he would think otherwise.</p><p>Two weeks later, during her twelfth week of pregnancy, Cleo was sitting in the waiting area of Dante\u2019s office, smiling nervously at Mrs. Clarke. The woman\u2014currently sporting a gigantic diamond on her ring finger courtesy of Mr. Whitman, who had proposed after just a month of \u201ccourting\u201d\u2014had happily agreed to help Cleo sneak in a visit with Dante. Cleo didn\u2019t want him to know she was coming, didn\u2019t want him to speculate about the purpose of her visit, so here she was . . . ready to turn his carefree bachelor existence upside down.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be done with that conference call in about ten minutes, dear,\u201d Mrs. Clarke informed her. \u201cWould you like a cup of coffee or tea while you wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you, Mrs. Clarke, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d As much as Cleo would have loved a cup of herbal tea to settle her nerves, her bladder had become ridiculously small over the last few weeks. She couldn\u2019t trust herself not to need a bathroom within minutes and miss her window of opportunity.</p><p>She was nervous about seeing Dante again, not just because of the news she had, but because she couldn\u2019t help wondering if that crazy chemistry would still sizzle between them. She didn\u2019t understand this attraction they had for each other. How could you want someone so desperately while disliking them so intensely? It was bizarre. Well, whether the chemistry still existed or not was a moot point; this baby would take care of any lingering desire soon enough. Dante was about to regret the day he\u2019d met her.</p> <p>She was nervously twiddling her thumbs when Mrs. Clarke looked up at her.</p><p>\u201cYou can go in now, Cleo. And please bring this to Mr. Damaso.\u201d She handed Cleo a folder. Cleo straightened her skirt before taking the folder with trembling fingers.</p><p>She halted outside of those intimidating walnut oak doors, straightened her shoulders, and, after a cursory knock, let herself in. His dark head was bent as he focused on his phone, and he didn\u2019t so much as glance up while she hovered awkwardly just inside the doors. She was so enthralled by the sight of him that when he spoke, she nearly jumped out of her skin.</p><p>\u201cJust leave the folder on my desk, Mrs. Clarke,\u201d he said irritably, head still down. When she made no move to obey him, completely unable to unstick her frozen feet from the floor, he glanced up with an imposing frown. The frown deepened into a scowl when he saw her. That scowl certainly didn\u2019t bode well for the future of this meeting. At first, he just stared at her, making her wonder if he\u2019d forgotten her name again, but after a few excruciatingly long moments, he finally spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, Knight? I\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that, but I need to speak with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time for idle chitchat,\u201d he said dismissively. \u201cAnd quite frankly, I don\u2019t care what this is about. If you have any grievances about Whitman or your new position, take them up with Whitman\u2019s second in HR. Just because we happened to have a thing at some point doesn\u2019t entitle you to special privileges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want special privileges,\u201d she said automatically and then hesitated because she kind of did want special privileges. That slight hesitation put her on the defensive, and she grappled desperately for a way to regain momentum. She walked toward his desk and sat down in the same chair she had once sunk down into in a postcoital blaze. The memory of that morning was enough to stain her cheeks red, and the dilation of his pupils and tightening of his jaw told her he knew exactly why she was blushing. They both took a moment to lose themselves in that raunchy memory before Dante snapped back to reality.</p><p>\u201cYou need to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot before I say what I came here to say,\u201d she maintained stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cI told you, I\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d she snapped, and then regretted her tone when he tensed and his eyes narrowed with temper. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry to intrude, but I really have something important to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think of anything you\u2019d have to say that could possibly be of interest to me,\u201d he growled, and settled back into his chair. He positioned his elbows on the armrests and steepled his hands just in front of his face. It made him look like a movie villain, which\u2014she supposed\u2014was the point. \u201cBut if you really think it\u2019s that important, make an appointment. My time is precious, and I have no room in my schedule for you today. That will be all. Good day.\u201d</p><p>She watched as he unfolded his tall frame and leaned forward to grab his phone and the folder she had dropped on the desk. She was so shocked by the rude dismissal that all she could do was gape at him as he got up and started to round the desk, clearly intending to leave the office.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She jumped up and moved into his path. When he casually stepped right past her, she did the only thing she could think of. She ran to the door before he could get there and pinned her back against it with her arms spread out. He stopped directly in front of her; there wasn\u2019t much more than a foot between them.</p><p>\u201cKnight, I won\u2019t hesitate to call security,\u201d he warned. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to get on my nerves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d she blurted, and the look of horror on his face would have been comical if Cleo wasn\u2019t so damned anxious about his response.</p><p>\u201cQu\u00e9?\u201d He exploded hoarsely. \u201cQu\u00e9 dijiste?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he repeated in English, his voice brittle.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me,\u201d she said, keeping her chin up and defiant. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish to know what you think you will gain from telling me this news. Is this some kind of joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no joke; I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery well. Let us play this game.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWho is the father of this child you carry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00e9 que mientes! Te conozco muy bien.\u201d The frigid outpouring of Spanish told her more than anything else how much she had rattled him and how angry he was. He turned away from her and strode back to his desk, probably in an effort to put as much distance as possible between them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying to me,\u201d he grated after he had the length of the office and a desk between them. \u201cI like being lied to even less than I like being blatantly manipulated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying.\u201d She tried to sound calm even though she felt far from it on the inside. This was exactly the reaction she\u2019d been expecting. She warily\u2014and on unsteady legs\u2014made her own way to the desk. She sank back into the chair simply because her legs could no longer support her.</p><p>\u201cThis is so much bullshit. I suggest you leave this office before I call security, and I want you to vacate the building in under an hour. You\u2019re fired.\u201d</p> <p>Her knees shook so badly they were practically knocking together, and her teeth were rattling in her head as shock caused her to quiver.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fire me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s completely unethical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as unethical as what you\u2019re trying to do right now. Don\u2019t bother to work out a month\u2019s notice either. We\u2019ll pay you a month\u2019s salary in lieu of notice. Using our past intimacy in this way is a complete betrayal. I no longer trust you to work for this company, I no longer believe that you are an ethical person, and I cannot have someone like you employed here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant, with your baby,\u201d she said adamantly, and he swore before picking up his phone and punching in a number.</p><p>\u201cSend security up to my office, immediately,\u201d he barked at whoever happened to be at the other end of the line.</p><p>\u201cYou need to hear me out, Dante,\u201d she said earnestly. This wasn\u2019t at all how she had expected this meeting to go. She\u2019d known he would be upset, but this reaction was extreme even for Dante.</p><p>\u201cI am Mr. Damaso to you,\u201d he flared arrogantly, and she snorted.</p><p>\u201cFine. Mr. Damaso, one of your condoms failed, and one of your overambitious little soldiers found its mark and left me knocked up.\u201d She spoke fast, aware that time was a limited commodity. He moved away from the desk and turned his back on her, staring out the window and refusing to acknowledge her words. But Cleo kept talking. \u201cI\u2019m keeping my baby. I don\u2019t want you to be a part of his life, and I don\u2019t want you to give me a huge amount of money.\u201d He swiveled back to face her at that pronouncement, his expression insultingly skeptical.</p> <p>\u201cNot a huge amount, but some, right?\u201d He mocked.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. Of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d There was a world of sarcasm in those two words.</p><p>\u201cNot a lot, a monthly allowance that will go only to this baby\u2019s health and well-being. I didn\u2019t ask for this, I didn\u2019t intend to get pregnant, but now that the baby is here, I can\u2019t do anything else but keep it and love it. But I can\u2019t afford to take care of a child without some sort of support from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t leave my office immediately, it will be rather embar-rassing for you when security drags you out,\u201d he said coldly.</p><p>\u201cDante . . . Mr. Damaso, look\u2014\u201d</p><p>He held up a palm, and it shut her up immediately.</p><p>\u201cMierda! Enough! Enough of this now, Miss Knight. It was a good attempt to fleece me but hardly very original. I suggest you go back to the real father of your child\u2014that blond giant, perhaps?\u2014and hit him up for some cash. Unless the two of you hatched this scheme up together?\u201d</p><p>He thought Cal was her baby\u2019s father? She would have laughed at that if this whole situation weren\u2019t so damned tragic.</p><p>She pulled an envelope from her shoulder bag and dropped it on his desk.</p><p>\u201cPlease read these documents I\u2019ve had drawn up when you have the time. I understand that this has come as a complete shock to you, but maybe after you\u2019ve calmed down, you\u2019ll be able to approach this situation in a more rational and calm manner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am more than rational and calm, Miss Knight. I can see quite clearly what\u2019s happening here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonetheless, I\u2019ll leave these here.\u201d</p><p>Two burly uniformed security guards finally stepped into his office, and he glared at them.</p><p>\u201cYour response time is appalling,\u201d he gritted. \u201cI could have been murdered up here while you dawdled over your coffee and doughnuts.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The two men apologized profusely, and he shut them up with a wave of his hand.</p><p>\u201cSee Miss Knight back to her desk, wait while she packs her personal items, and escort her out of the building. I want her gone within the hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d one huge guy responded curtly while the other slanted her a sympathetic sideways glance.</p><p>They approached her chair and flanked her, and one of them dropped a hand on her shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cDo not touch her.\u201d Dante surprised them all by snapping out the command.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d the security guard mumbled awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cYou need to come with us, miss,\u201d the other guy said, and Cleo nodded, feeling defeated and exhausted. Her hand dropped protectively to her flat abdomen; the gesture was unconscious and seemed to draw his eye and darken his expression even further. She pushed herself up tiredly and grabbed one brawny guard\u2019s arm for support as she swayed slightly. She held on to him as they both escorted her out of his office. She could feel Dante\u2019s eyes boring into her back as she left, but she refused to look back. If this was how he wanted it, then so be it. She would find a way to look after her baby without his help. Dante Damaso be damned.</p><p>Dante dragged both hands through his hair and gulped in a deep, semicalming breath. The nerve of her. The goddamned, absolute gall of her.</p><p>Who the hell did she think she was? Who did she think he was? Some na\u00efve fool who would fall for such a ridiculous and obvious ploy? He was absolutely livid. He wanted to wring her duplicitous little neck with both hands.</p> <p>He leaped into action, jumping out of his chair and striding determinedly toward the doors. Halfway there he turned back and grabbed the envelope she left on his desk. He didn\u2019t even want to look at it, but he\u2019d need to show it to Mike Grayson, his personal attorney.</p><p>He glared at Mrs. Clarke on his way out.</p><p>\u201cYou and I will have words later about the type of riffraff you allow into my office, Mrs. Clarke,\u201d he snapped, and the woman paled in response to his words. He was too furious to take even the mildest satisfaction in that reaction.</p><p>Two hours didn\u2019t do much to calm his temper. He found himself sitting across from Mike Grayson, still wearing the glare that felt like it had taken up permanent residence on his face. Mike had been startled to see his biggest client walk into his office earlier. Mike usually came to Dante, never vice versa. The fact that he had stormed into the man\u2019s office defying their usual protocol spoke to Dante\u2019s current frame of mind. He felt completely . . . discombobulated. He was annoyed with himself for not seeing this coming. Surely he should have sensed this mercenary streak in her? He usually had a better nose for these things. When she had signed that nondisclosure agreement without much protest, he had considered himself in the clear. But he had completely underestimated the lengths some women would go to for a little bit of his wealth.</p><p>\u201cI have to say, it\u2019s a pretty fair deal,\u201d the other man said. Exactly what Dante did not want to hear.</p><p>\u201cShe wants a monthly stipend from the baby\u2019s birth right up until its eighteenth birthday or until she marries, whichever comes first. She asks for only enough to take care of basic necessities: food, clothing, and medical bills\u2014for the child, not for her. She asks for an increase to cover school fees and other necessities when the child is old enough. There is, of course, interest applied commensurate to whatever changes take place in the economy. And she wants these only if a paternity test proves that you are indeed the child\u2019s father.\u201d</p> <p>Dante\u2019s jaw dropped. Why make that stipulation unless she was absolutely certain he was the child\u2019s father? Had she sabotaged his condoms somehow? He immediately discounted that possibility. They had never left his possession, and he was always the one to don them, without exception. Ever. He couldn\u2019t chance an accidental fingernail through the latex. He had learned that lesson the hard way, when he had caught one of his former lovers blatantly trying to break a condom while supposedly \u201cfumbling\u201d with it as she tried to sheathe him. Having escaped that particular trap, Dante had never allowed for the possibility again. No woman ever got her hands on his condoms.</p><p>Which meant, if this baby was his, it was because his method of protection had failed. He had always known condoms were not 100 percent foolproof, but he had considered the risk negligible. Until now.</p><p>He shook his head, disgusted with himself, with her, with the whole bloody world.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a dad,\u201d he growled. \u201cIs there any way to get her to . . .\u201d He couldn\u2019t verbalize it. It made him feel like a louse.</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s got you covered there too,\u201d Mike said, sounding almost admiring. \u201cAll you have to do is agree to these terms, sign this paper, and she\u2019s happy to forget you were even there at its conception. All financial transactions will be done through your attorney and hers. The baby will have her name, and the father shall remain undisclosed. And the existing nondisclosure agreement ensures that she will never speak of your relationship in Tokyo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, your sordid encounter, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful, Mike,\u201d Dante warned. He had known Mike for years and they had a fantastic professional and personal relationship, but Dante\u2019s mood was too uncertain at the moment to cope with the man\u2019s irreverent sense of humor.</p> <p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Mike hummed noncommittally. \u201cWell, I think this is all pretty aboveboard. She doesn\u2019t want a cent from you until you\u2019re satisfied that the baby is yours, and even then she won\u2019t expect payment to start until after the birth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Okay, so Dante was willing to concede that maybe she wasn\u2019t as mercenary as he\u2019d first thought, and he was also willing to accept his culpability in the matter if, indeed, she did turn out to be pregnant with his baby. But she\u2019d better be serious about not expecting anything more from him because he for damned sure wanted nothing to do with her or the baby. If he ever decided to have kids someday, the mother he chose for those children would be as far removed from Cleopatra Knight as night was from day. He would do his duty and pay whatever money she needed to raise her child. But that was it. No emotional commitments were required or expected of him, and he was satisfied with that.</p><p>Cleo sat at her kitchen table staring at the damp stain on the wall above the refrigerator with a tub of melting ice cream forgotten in front of her. The front door opened and Cal stepped in, bringing with him the fresh smell of wind and rain.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He removed his coat and tossed it carelessly over the back of the couch and grabbed a spoon from the drying rack on the sink before sitting down opposite her and helping himself to her softening chocolate-mint ice cream. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can eat this stuff in the middle of winter. It\u2019s freezing out there and you\u2019re sitting in here eating ice cream.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged listlessly, barely hearing him. She sat with her cheek resting in the palm of one hand, one foot tucked beneath her butt and the other swinging in circles above the floor. She looked like a cranky child.</p> <p>\u201cHow did it go?\u201d Cal asked softly, displaying more sensitivity than she would ever have given him credit for.</p><p>\u201cI got fired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d She shrugged again.</p><p>\u201cAw, man. Hon, I\u2019m so sorry to hear that. What a complete dick that guy is! How could he fire you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe thinks I\u2019m some . . .\u201d She heard her voice thicken with tears. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Some opportunistic, mercenary, money-hungry bitch or something.\u201d She shoved the ice cream aside and folded her arms on the table before burying her face in them and giving way to the tears that had been threatening all afternoon.</p><p>Cal rubbed a hand up and down her back as she cried, her sobs quiet and her tears plentiful.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she confessed after a few long moments of cathartic crying. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out, Cleo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no job, no savings . . . how can I take care of this baby? I can\u2019t move in with Luc and Blue. It would be so unfair. Just when they\u2019re starting to get their lives sorted out, along comes the family failure with another setback for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think like that,\u201d Cal said. \u201cThink solutions. Not problems.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell does that even mean?\u201d she asked, her voice seething with frustration. \u201cHow am I supposed to \u2018think solutions\u2019? What solutions? There are no solutions right now, Cal. So how about just letting me wallow for a few lousy moments?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d He sat back and took another spoonful of ice cream. \u201cI\u2019m going to assume that\u2019s the pregnancy talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the pregnancy,\u201d she denied, as even more tears threatened. Where was this endless supply coming from? Surely she should have run dry by now. \u201cIt\u2019s everything. You\u2019ve never really grown up, Cal. You don\u2019t know how to deal like an adult. So all you have are these preppy teen words of advice that don\u2019t mean squat in the real world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this is mature behavior?\u201d he fired back, waving his spoon up and down in her direction. \u201cThis crying-fest, while you lash out at someone who cares about you instead of at the real object of your frustration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how am I supposed to lash out at him? He had me kicked out of his office before I even had a chance to properly talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, like, literally kicked out?\u201d His eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cCalled security and had me escorted out of the building,\u201d she confirmed, and his jaw dropped.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. I felt so . . .\u201d The tears overflowed again as she remembered the mortifying moment she was marched out of his office and back to her own desk. \u201cHumiliated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat guy needs his ass kicked! Tell your brother about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She could hear the panic in her own voice. \u201cNo, Cal. Luc doesn\u2019t hear about this. He\u2019s not to know who the father of this child is.\u201d She was too embarrassed to let Luc know what a colossal mistake she\u2019d made with Dante, and she couldn\u2019t ruin a friendship he held dear.</p><p>\u201cBut what will you tell him about your job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him I quit or something. It\u2019ll be easy enough for him to believe of his loser sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, hon,\u201d Cal said. \u201cThat\u2019s hardly fair. This wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease just leave it for now.\u201d</p><p>Cal nodded reluctantly and Cleo reached over to squeeze his forearm gently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I snapped at you, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t grim enough to suit the occasion.\u201d</p><p>She giggled wetly at the lame joke, and Cal grimaced before reaching into his pocket for a handkerchief.</p><p>\u201cJesus, blow your nose,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at the state of you. You\u2019re such an ugly crier, Cleo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d she laughed, and blew her nose gustily. At that moment she just appreciated his presence so much that she couldn\u2019t hold back an impulsive hug. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you. Sometimes I just don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you.\u201d</p><p>By ten the following morning, Cleo was still lounging around in her robe and pajamas. She had no real desire to do much. She felt flat. She\u2019d spent the better part of the morning hugging the toilet bowl, vomiting, and now she felt completely wrung out. Her stomach still uncertain, she gingerly padded to the sleeper couch that Cal had, for once, made up before traipsing off to parts unknown earlier that morning. He always disappeared for hours on end doing God knows what, God knows where. Cleo had been relieved to see the back of him that morning because his relentless and oblivious good cheer was driving her up the wall.</p><p>She was thinking about attempting to eat some food when a knock sounded on the front door. She frowned, not used to being here during the day and not at all sure who it could be. They had an intercom security system, so knocks at the door without advance warning were extremely rare.</p><p>The knock sounded again, and she pushed herself up from the couch. She paused for an instant to get the nausea under control, before making her way to the front door. There was no peephole, so she\u2019d have to go the other route.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d she called through the door. There was a long moment of silence during which she wondered if the person had moved on to a different apartment.</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d The voice, only slightly muffled by the thin wood of the door, was instantly recognizable, and Cleo froze. When she didn\u2019t respond for a full minute, the knock sounded again, loud and authoritative and so damned like him she wondered how she hadn\u2019t guessed who it was from the sound of the knock alone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Damaso!\u201d he growled. \u201cOpen the damned door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>She could practically feel his incredulity through the wood.</p><p>\u201cI said no. Go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not leave until we have settled this matter.\u201d He sounded pretty adamant, and she chewed on her lip indecisively.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think there was anything to settle. You\u2019ve made your mind up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI refuse to discuss this through the door. If you do not open it, I will kick it down. I don\u2019t imagine it will take too much effort, the wood is so thin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t all have fancy walnut oak doors,\u201d she said with a sneer, and he was right: the wood was pretty thin if she could hear him sigh through the door.</p> <p>\u201cI will count to three. If you do not open the door, I will\u2014\u201d</p><p>She clicked her tongue irritably and snatched open the door. Only after she stood facing him in his bespoke-suited splendor did she remember that she wore fleecy, polka-dot pajamas with a fuzzy pink robe and pink-and-white bunny slippers. Her hair was a mess, and she probably looked pretty washed out after that morning\u2019s puking session. And the way he stared at her told her everything she needed to know about how truly awful she looked.</p><p>\u201cYour hair . . .\u201d</p><p>She stared at him in complete bewilderment. Why would her hair be the first thing he noticed about her? And then she remembered. She reached up a trembling hand to run a hand through her short, sleek bob, trying to recall if the pink she and Cal had applied to the bleached tips of her hair the night before was particularly vivid.</p><p>\u201cI figured I didn\u2019t have to look like a corporate drone anymore,\u201d she said, shrugging slightly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly the tips.\u201d</p><p>He finally dragged his horrified gaze from her hair down the rest of her body.</p> <p>\u201cDid I disturb your sleep?\u201d he asked, looking truly confused.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see the need to get dressed when I don\u2019t have a job to get ready for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you did not consider going out to look for a new job?\u201d</p><p>Jeez, rich people really had no clue how the real world worked. He sounded way too judgmental for her liking, and she bristled defensively.</p><p>\u201cI just got fired from my previous position yesterday. I haven\u2019t had time to sit down with the classifieds to job-hunt yet.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and shoved his hands into his coat pockets as his gaze roamed around the small, slightly dingy, and far-from-tidy interior of her apartment.</p><p>\u201cThis place has lousy security. A student type in baggy jeans and a Rastafarian cap simply let me in. Held the door open and waved me through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he might have been on something,\u201d he said, voice ripe with disapproval.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s who I\u2019m thinking of, then he was very definitely on something.\u201d Young Isaac from down the hall was always high. Cleo didn\u2019t know how he managed to get any studying done. Dante\u2019s brow furrowed in response to her words.</p><p>\u201cAnd you feel safe in this dump?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d she asked, refusing to answer any more of his questions.</p><p>\u201cMay I sit?\u201d After a brief hesitation, she nodded. He glanced around the room again before heading toward the kitchen table and turning to wait for her there. Once she joined him, he dragged out a chair, ushered her into it, and took his own seat. A little flustered by the gentlemanly gesture, she waited for him to speak. But he didn\u2019t say anything for a long time and merely stared at his loosely folded hands resting on the table in front of him.</p><p>She shifted uncomfortably before he lifted his eyes and trapped her with that intense gaze of his. She froze beneath that stare, feeling like a butterfly pinned to a board.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far along are you now?\u201d he asked. She couldn\u2019t help it; she allowed her hand to drop to her abdomen, still in awe that there was a life in there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTwelve weeks,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThis week her eyelids started to grow in properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Her\u2019?\u201d he asked gruffly, and she shook herself out of her reverie to focus on him again.</p><p>\u201cThe baby\u2019s a \u2018she\u2019 this week. Last week a \u2018he.\u2019 Last week was exciting; she\u2014or he\u2014started making fists. Can you imagine this little life, barely the size of a prune, with tiny hands that can make fists?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you feel it doing all that? Making fists and stuff?\u201d he sounded fascinated despite himself.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t. I\u2019ve been reading this week-by-week pregnancy book. It\u2019s really good.\u201d</p><p>There was another long, awkward silence as Cleo tried to figure out if she could say or do anything to convince him to leave. \u201cI wish I had security guards too,\u201d she said wistfully, and he glanced up at her in surprise.</p><p>\u201cSo that you can kick me out?\u201d He sounded amused rather than offended.</p><p>\u201cI want you to leave,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI don\u2019t like having you here in my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to tell you that I agree to your terms. I\u2019ve signed your documents. If I am the father of that baby, I will pay an amount toward its support.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t try to take her from me?\u201d Cleo verbalized her worst fear on a whisper.</p><p>\u201cNo. Your baby doesn\u2019t interest me. You don\u2019t interest me. I want you both out of my life as quickly and quietly as possible.\u201d</p><p>Well, she\u2019d always known that was how he would feel, but the rejection still stung. She felt the pain more for her baby than she did for herself. She\u2019d known the stakes going into this thing with Dante Damaso, but the baby was an innocent in all of this, and now would never have a father to love her and protect her. Still, he was cold and ruthless and would undoubtedly make a lousy father. She\u2019d grown up without a dad, and while she was a mess at times, she\u2019d turned out mostly all right. Luc barely remembered their father either; the man had stuck around for five years and had skipped out on his family less than a month after Cleo\u2019s birth. Their mother, never the most stable of creatures, had gone on a downward spiral after that, and five years later had dumped her children with their grandparents and swanned off to Asia. None of them had seen or heard from her again, and Luc and Cleo had received word of her death soon after their grandparents had passed. Luc flew to Nepal, where she died, and took care of the funeral arrangements. He returned with a few boxes of her personal items, and that had been that. A sad and lonely ending to a sad and lonely life.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you send your attorney to take care of the matter?\u201d she asked Dante. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to come in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make it perfectly clear that this is all there will ever be between us, just a financial agreement benefitting the child should it happen to be mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d she murmured. As if she needed that obvious fact spelled out to her.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I wanted to add that perhaps I was a little . . . hasty in firing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHasty? Try unfair,\u201d she corrected. \u201cAnd harsh. You treated me like a criminal. Do you have any idea how humiliating it was to be escorted out by your thugs? I didn\u2019t get to say good-bye to anybody, and I heard rumors that maybe I\u2019d been caught stealing.\u201d</p><p>He looked uncomfortable and his broad shoulders shifted restlessly.</p><p>\u201cIt was not my intention to humiliate you.\u201d</p><p>His words infuriated her and opened her eyes to the fact that she was a lot angrier about the embarrassing experience than she realized.</p><p>\u201cIs that an apology? Because if it is, it needs work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, this is not getting us anywhere,\u201d he deflected. \u201cI would like to offer you another position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack in HR?\u201d she asked, allowing the subject change. For now.</p> <p>\u201cNo, there would be too many uncomfortable questions. I want to move you to the Joburg office.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he wanted to move her to an unfamiliar office, in a strange city miles away from her family and friends, did he? And far, far away from him. Wouldn\u2019t that just make his life a whole lot easier? Not that Cleo was interested in making it difficult; she just wanted to move on with her own life and forget she even knew Dante Damaso.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t move to Johannesburg,\u201d she stated, her voice brooking no argument.</p><p>\u201cLook, be reasonable. You can hardly raise a kid without some form of employment to bolster the financial aid you\u2019ll be receiving from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou be reasonable. If I take you up on this offer, I may have the benefit of an added income, but I won\u2019t have the emotional support I would need from my family and friends. This is my first pregnancy, I\u2019ll be going it solo, and I\u2019ll want my brother, Blue, and my other close friends around. I\u2019ll want familiar surroundings. The last thing I want or need right now is to move to an unfamiliar city.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a long time before conceding the point with a very brief dip of his jaw.</p><p>\u201cGive me time and I\u2019ll try to arrange something else,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need any favors from you, Mr. Damaso.\u201d He looked almost embarrassed by the honorific he had insisted she use just the day before. \u201cJust child support. You are in no way responsible for any other part of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonetheless, I am the reason you no longer have a job. I acted hastily and would like to make amends for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA glowing reference would do just fine, thank you,\u201d she said, while the inner voice that had tried to warn her on that first night in Tokyo protested again. As before, she didn\u2019t listen to it, and Cleo hoped she wouldn\u2019t wind up\u2014once again\u2014paying for her refusal to heed her common sense. But she had some pride, and depending on him for child support was bad enough; she didn\u2019t want to depend on him for her very livelihood too, not after he had so unceremoniously fired her the day before. Yet another thing, she noted, that he had not yet apologized for. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo how does this paternity-test thing work?\u201d He changed the subject rather abruptly and looked remarkably uncomfortable with his own question.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re the one who wants proof that the baby is yours, so you\u2019re going to have to arrange for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have prenatal tests, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will accept only noninvasive testing. Anything else could potentially harm my baby.\u201d He grunted, a sound she assumed meant assent. \u201cAnd you\u2019re paying for it. I\u2019m not paying for some stupid test I already know the answer to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have to protect myself,\u201d he said almost defensively. \u201cYou\u2019re not the first woman to ever accuse me of fathering her baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, you mean you have other illegitimate kids running around out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not! Those other women weren\u2019t even pregnant.\u201d He looked so disgusted that Cleo almost felt sorry for him. It couldn\u2019t be easy to be the target of so many gold diggers\u2014no wonder he had them all sign nondisclosure agreements. Then again, how many good, decent women had he scared off with that stupid document? His personal life was crazy and a little messed up, and she was happy enough to stay well away from it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should consider limiting yourself to\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014one or two serious relationships a year, with nicer women. You may find life a lot easier in the long run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing with you wasn\u2019t a relationship and it wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d She held up a hand to shut him up. Surprisingly enough it worked.</p> <p>\u201cSpare me. I\u2019ve heard it all before. Blah, blah, \u2018you\u2019re not my usual type\u2019 blah, blah, \u2018it wasn\u2019t serious\u2019 blah, blah, blah. You\u2019re like a broken record, Mr. Damaso. It gets tedious after a while. Now would you please mind leaving me alone? I have stuff to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, call me Dante,\u201d he commanded, and she sighed before crossing her arms over her chest.</p><p>\u201cI prefer \u2018Mr. Damaso.\u2019 It keeps things businesslike and impersonal. Besides, I hope never to see you again after this, so does it matter what I call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose not.\u201d He levered himself up from the table and stood towering above her for a few long moments before she scrambled to her feet to feel less small. The hasty movement immediately sent her stomach into turmoil, and she clapped a hand over her mouth and pushed past him to the bathroom, where she was violently ill.</p><p>When she eventually came back to her miserable senses, it was to find Dante Damaso on his haunches beside where she was hunched wretchedly over the commode, one of his large hands stroking her back soothingly. Appalled that he had seen her like that, she shrugged off his touch and moved away from him shakily, ignoring him when he reached down to help her stand.</p><p>He allowed her that small, defiant move and stood back and watched while she splashed water on her face\u2014soaking the front of her robe in the process\u2014and gargled some mouthwash. She pretended he wasn\u2019t there and exited the bathroom to return to the living room with her spine straight and her chin up.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe you should lie down or something,\u201d he suggested, and she swallowed down her irritation as she glanced over her shoulder to find him watching her from the bathroom door.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you still here?\u201d She trudged the short distance to her room, shrugged out of her wet robe, and hung it from a hook on her wall to dry. Unfortunately, he followed her. Could the man not take a hint?</p><p>He shoved his hands into his trouser pockets and glanced around her bedroom, taking in the clothes that were draped over every surface, the posters of ballet and contemporary dancers that adorned her beige walls, and the ragged pointe shoes that were hanging from one of the posts of her gorgeous, antique, queen-size four-poster bed. She loved that bed, had brought it with her from her old bedroom in the house when she moved out. It cost the earth to transport it every time she moved, but she would never sell it or leave it behind.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t figure out if this room is a teen dream or nightmare,\u201d he mused, and leveled that killer gaze on her again. \u201cA bit juvenile, isn\u2019t it? Do you plan to move out of this dump before you have the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your damned business. Please leave,\u201d she demanded wearily. He sighed impatiently and turned to walk the short distance to her bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cMike Grayson, my attorney, will be in touch.\u201d He threw the words over his shoulder as he reached for the front door. She trailed him back into the living room and was startled when he unexpectedly turned around again to look at her. \u201cEat something. You look like hell.\u201d</p><p>And with that parting shot, he was gone, leaving Cleo feeling absolutely drained in his wake. Her legs turned to liquid as she finally allowed herself to relax, and she sank down onto the sleeper couch.</p><p>The door opened again seconds later and surprised the hell out of her. She jumped\u2014instantly back on alert\u2014when his head popped through the opening.</p> <p>\u201cAnd lock the damned door!\u201d he ordered before leaving again. She stared at the closed door in complete disbelief, before forcing herself up to do just as he\u2019d commanded. More as a deterrent against any more unwelcome visits from him than out of any real fear of an intruder.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>Ten days and one simple cheek swab later, Dante sat in his office and stared at the discreet, still-closed envelope he held in his hands. He knew what it would say; he\u2019d known since that first meeting with Mike. A mercenary woman would have demanded far more from him than Cleo had.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said aloud. And it didn\u2019t. It couldn\u2019t. This kid wouldn\u2019t be his in any way except biologically, and he could live with that. He could quite happily live with that. Why should he sacrifice his freedom for what amounted to a stupid mistake? Cleo chose to keep the baby, and Dante chose not to know the child. They could both live with that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And someday\u2014when it was old enough\u2014the kid would have to live with that too.</p><p>He would have to live with the knowledge that his father had chosen not to know him. Or love him.</p><p>Dante noticed, almost impassively, that his hands had started to shake, and he dropped the envelope onto his desk and clenched his fists to control the tremble. He picked it up again seconds later, took in a huge gulp of air, and tore it open\u2014the violence of the gesture akin to ripping a Band-Aid off a wound.</p><p>He unfolded the slip of paper carefully, reading through the scientific jargon before getting to the most relevant bit.</p> <p>Cannot be excluded as the father of the child . . . probability of paternity 99.9992%</p><p>Right.</p><p>He refolded the paper precisely along the original lines and noted that his hands were trembling again. He meticulously placed it back into its envelope and then smoothed it carefully flat on the desk\u2019s surface before tucking it away into the breast pocket of his jacket. Once there, it felt like it was burning a hole into his chest, so he removed it again and shoved it into his desk drawer. He locked the drawer and tucked the key into his breast pocket.</p><p>He had anticipated this; he had known it was coming, so now he could continue with his life as planned. This matter was already taken care of; Mike had only been waiting for confirmation of the child\u2019s paternity before he made the financial arrangements. It was out of Dante\u2019s hands now. He could get back to business. He could build more hotels; go out with gorgeous, glamorous women; and one day\u2014years from now\u2014even marry one of them. That woman would be the mother of his children. Simple and uncomplicated, that\u2019s how he liked his life. And the woman he chose to be his wife would have to be equally simple and uncomplicated. Someone who could make his life easier without needing constant attention and validation. Cleo and the baby were just obstacles to overcome before he could get back out onto the open, uncomplicated road of his life again. He need never think of them again.</p><p>Only . . .</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t help but recall the last time he\u2019d seen Cleo, and he wondered if she\u2019d found another job. And if she\u2019d moved into a better, more secure apartment yet. Were the tips of her glossy black hair still that horrendous shade of pink?</p><p>Did she still suffer from morning sickness?</p><p>What wonders did week fourteen hold?</p><p>Mierda!</p><p>He had to stop thinking about this. He picked up his phone and thumbed through his contacts before finding the name he was searching for.</p><p>\u201cNicki, querida, this is Dante. Do you want to meet for a drink later?\u201d</p> <p>He was going to get this situation out of his mind in a time-honored tradition. With booze, babes, and lots and lots of sex.</p><p>Cleo read the test results, laughed, then cried a little and laughed again before tearing the paper up and tossing the pieces in the bin. She would probably hear from Grantley Bingham, her grandparents\u2019 really ancient attorney, soon. Mr. Bingham had kindly offered to help her out for a fraction of his usual fee because he felt he owed it to her grandparents. He\u2019d been dealing directly with Dante\u2019s attorney and had informed her that things were going along swimmingly at the moment.</p><p>The old man was sweet, and despite knowing her for her entire life, had remained completely nonjudgmental and professional throughout their proceedings. He had merely congratulated her on her pregnancy and kept giving her unwanted advice on everything from morning sickness to baby names.</p><p>Cleo rested a hand on the still-flat surface of her abdomen. She still suffered from morning sickness, but luckily it wasn\u2019t too debilitating anymore. Even though her book told her that her energy should be returning, she continued to feel lethargic, which she put down to a mild case of depression. She didn\u2019t have a job yet, and once she started showing it would be even more difficult to find anything. Luc and Blue had been pressing her to move in with them, and it was becoming the likeliest scenario for her.</p><p>Luc had been seriously pissed off with her when she\u2019d told him that she\u2019d quit her job, and he\u2019d put it down to \u201cCleo being her usual irresponsible self.\u201d Cleo had said and done nothing to correct him.</p><p>Cleo was scared and felt alone and lonely, despite Cal\u2019s constant and overbearing presence and Luc and Blue\u2019s smothering. Most nights she woke up in an absolute panic, with cold sweat dripping down her body\u2014terrified of screwing up her baby\u2019s life\u2014and she had absolutely no one to talk to about that.</p><p>She had her first dating ultrasound coming up in a couple of days and hadn\u2019t even told Blue about it. The appointment was for midday, and she didn\u2019t want Blue to take off any more time from work to go with her. Luc managed a small IT company in a rundown industrial part of town, and the place always seemed to fall completely apart when he wasn\u2019t there. She could take Cal, but quite frankly, she\u2019d rather go alone; he tended to irritate her when she felt even remotely stressed.</p><p>She looked around her flat and sighed. She\u2019d been cooped up in here for too long. She hadn\u2019t ventured out much due to a lack of funds and a lack of desire to do anything remotely social. But she was unaccustomed to going so long without any form of exercise, and it was starting to give her a dose of cabin fever.</p> <p>She resolutely went about collecting her leotard, a gauzy crepe wrap skirt, tights, and pointe shoes and stuffed them into a tote bag. She tied her short hair up into a small, tight ponytail and grabbed up her coat on her way out the door.</p><p>It was midspring, but the air still had a bite, and it had been an unseasonably rainy October. A fine, misty rain fell outside, and as she walked the short distance to her favorite dance studio, the light precipitation frizzed her hair and dampened her face. The air smelled clean and she inhaled deeply. She would have to pay for her entry into the studio, and she couldn\u2019t really afford to spend the money, but she really needed this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCleo, we haven\u2019t seen you in months,\u201d Susan Killian, the owner of the studio, enthused when Cleo entered the place. She was all smiles and came around the reception desk to give Cleo a hug. The woman was short and comfortably plump, she had unnaturally brassy red hair\u2014always up in a messy bun\u2014wore too much makeup, and had glasses perched on the tip of her nose. She had a habit of staring over the top of them when she was speaking to someone, which made her look like an aging librarian. She was still hugging Cleo\u2014who was only an inch or two taller than the other woman\u2014to her ample chest, enveloping her in an overpowering cloud of Red Door by Elizabeth Arden. Susan had been a pretty decent dancer back in her heyday, before retiring and opening the dance studio. Now she taught ballet to girls ranging in age from just three to fifteen as well as an adult beginner\u2019s class in the evenings. She had often tried to enlist Cleo\u2019s help with a couple of the classes, but Cleo was resistant to the idea. She felt that taking the step toward teaching would be the final nail in her dancing dream\u2019s coffin, and as she\u2019d told Blue, she honestly didn\u2019t think she had it in her to genuinely want her students to succeed. Which just made her feel like a terrible person. Even though she hadn\u2019t danced professionally in more than three years, she\u2019d never felt like it was completely lost to her. Now with the pregnancy, she knew that she\u2019d have to finally face reality. Time to grow up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a few personal issues to deal with,\u201d Cleo said, explaining her absence. \u201cCan I book some time at the barre?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can.\u201d Susan waved a hand carelessly. \u201cI\u2019m between classes right now, and the studio\u2019s practically empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Susan.\u201d</p> <p>Ten minutes later, as she was going through her stretching routine, she could feel the stiffness working its way out of her joints and muscles. The familiar routine felt like a comfortable blanket settling over her, and she cleared her mind entirely and focused only on her body. She moved on to her barre routine soon afterward, her intention to do a slow, easy workout in deference to her pregnancy and the lethargy she still felt. She\u2019d brought her own CD along, and as the soothing strains of the piano solo flowed over her, she started slowly and gently and dropped into her demi-pli\u00e9s. Simple and smooth. This was home to her.</p><p>By the time she\u2019d progressed to her en pointe exercises, she was starting to feel a bit of strain in her knee, but she worked through it. She\u2019d definitely encourage her child to dance, and hopefully he or she would derive as much joy and freedom from it as Cleo did. If not, she hoped they found something they loved as passionately.</p><p>She released the barre and moved into a fluid, easy arabesque en pointe on the left leg and held it for a couple of seconds longer than she normally would have, just to prove to herself that she could do it. When she moved to do it on the right leg, her knee immediately buckled, and she fell out of the arabesque with a frustrated cry. She grabbed hold of the barre with both hands and bowed her head in defeat.</p><p>\u201cStupid, stupid, stupid!\u201d she admonished herself. And it had been stupid; she\u2019d known it would happen. It always did, and yet, even three years after her accident, she kept trying. She was too stubborn for her own good sometimes. And dumb, definitely dumb.</p><p>She regained her composure and started her cooldown exercises, cutting her routine short because she felt disheartened and seriously exhausted. A telling sign that, even though it wasn\u2019t showing yet, her pregnancy was already changing her body. She could usually push herself twice as hard at the barre.</p> <p>Susan was reading a romance novel behind the reception desk when Cleo limped her way out of the studio, and she frowned in concern.</p><p>\u201cHave you been silly again?\u201d she asked, giving Cleo a disapproving glare over the top of her glasses.</p><p>\u201cNo more than usual.\u201d Cleo shrugged and slung a towel around her neck. She hadn\u2019t bothered to change\u2014merely pulled on a sweat suit to keep her muscles warm. She could be at home and under the shower in less than ten minutes, the studio was so close to her apartment. That was one of the reasons she\u2019d found the apartment so appealing in the first place, despite its many other faults.</p><p>She walked home, thankful that the drizzle had stopped even though the wind had picked up and she was walking against it. She was huddled beneath her coat, hands in her pockets and head down as protection from the wind, and didn\u2019t see the huge figure looming ahead of her at the entrance of her building until she was almost on top of him.</p><p>She yelped in fright and jumped back with her hand on her chest, prepared to scream or run, when she looked up and saw Dante Damaso peering down at her as if he didn\u2019t recognize her.</p><p>\u201cMiss Knight?\u201d</p> <p>God, why did he still insist on calling her that?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to inform you that the paternity test result came today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I want to assure you that you and the child will be provided for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the child,\u201d she corrected, and his brow lowered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be providing for only the child. I don\u2019t want your money for myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut the medical costs alone will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a job yet?\u201d His critical gaze swept over her body, and Cleo recognized what a mess she was and had to use every ounce of willpower not to touch her untidy hair self-consciously.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe longer you remain unemployed, the less likely you are to find a job in your\u201d\u2014he made a vague gesture at her stomach region\u2014\u201cuh.

For a man who likes to keep his personal life clutter free, you\u2019re making a total nuisance of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing about me,\u201d he grated.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you know even less than nothing about me,\u201d she hissed, sticking her face right up to his until they were almost nose to nose.</p><p>\u201cI know that you\u2019re stubborn, pregnant, and unemployed. I know that you\u2019re living in a hovel and are financially ill equipped to deal with this pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, what\u2019s my name then, smart-ass? Why do you keep calling me Miss Knight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot because I\u2019ve forgotten your name, Cleopatra,\u201d he murmured, his voice dropping an octave as his eyes fell to her mouth. She cleared her throat, feeling hot and uncomfortable, and she stepped back, but her heel caught the edge of the next step and she lost her balance. She windmilled as she struggled to regain her footing, but his hands dropped to her elbows and steadied her. \u201cI\u2019ve got you. You\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>Her own hands dug into his forearms as she fought her shock and tried to regain her breath and her equilibrium. One of his hands released its grip and moved up to cup her cheek.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gone remarkably pale. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>She started shaking as her fear of falling subsided.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said through chattering teeth. \u201cJust a bit shocked, is all. I mean there wasn\u2019t even the slightest possibility of falling, was there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he agreed. \u201cAnd if there was, you would probably have landed on me. So you would have been fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thought of falling terrifies me a bit,\u201d she confessed. Something she did only because she still felt so off-kilter.</p><p>\u201cThe scar on your knee?\u201d he asked perceptively. She didn\u2019t respond, merely stared at him mutely.</p> <p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s not do this again sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I come up?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a disbelieving look.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! You cannot come up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I suppose we\u2019ll have this discussion out on the steps, in public?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo right ahead,\u201d she invited, calling his bluff. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who doesn\u2019t like his business aired in public. I\u2019m quite comfortable with public scenes. I was once a performer.\u201d</p><p>That made him pause, but not for the reason she would have thought.</p><p>\u201cYou were? What kind of performer?\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged, uncomfortable with his interest.</p><p>\u201cLook, I won\u2019t take up more than five minutes of your time.\u201d He took a step down to give her some space, as if sensing that his presence was making her feel claustrophobic. He held his hands palms up in a gesture of surrender. Cleo looked over his shoulder, noting for the first time that his massive black car was parked next to the curb and that one of his hulking personal protection guys\u2014who often doubled as drivers for him\u2014watched them silently from beside the car.</p><p>\u201cHey, James,\u201d she called, and waved at the huge, tattooed, dark-suited bald man. He wore sunglasses, despite the gloom of the day. He lifted one of his hands to wave back at her.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your new puppy?\u201d Cleo asked. \u201cStill leaving surprise puddles on the floor for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting better,\u201d James replied with a thumbs-up.</p><p>\u201cHave you decided on a name for him yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiddles.\u201d Cleo laughed, aware of Dante\u2019s incredulity at the bizarre exchange between his bodyguard and former assistant. He focused a glare on James, who refolded his hands loosely in front on him and shifted his stance slightly, until he stood with his legs shoulder-width apart. That quickly, James went from personable and friendly to forbidding and formidable.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind? I would like to have a serious conversation with you,\u201d Dante said through clenched teeth, and Cleo sighed.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you can come up for five minutes,\u201d she said begrudgingly. \u201cBut you\u2019re starting to make a nuisance of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoted.\u201d</p><p>Dante trailed behind Cleo as she led the way to her fourth-floor apartment. He kept his eyes on her narrow, straight back, once again noting her grace and elegant carriage. She really carried herself beautifully, and it was one of the things he\u2019d found so appealing about her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know why he was here, but despite arranging to see Nicki Unwin\u2014one of his regular on-again/off-again lovers\u2014later that evening, he hadn\u2019t been able to get Cleopatra Knight out of his mind today. He had found himself standing at her doorstep for reasons that remained completely unfathomable to him.</p><p>As he followed her upstairs, he started to take in his surroundings a bit more. The place was a complete mess. It reeked of mold and damp, the wallpaper was peeling, the light in the stairwell flickered, and the stairs themselves were old and rickety. He couldn\u2019t understand why she lived here. Why didn\u2019t she move in with Lucius? Her brother had that huge old house. It wasn\u2019t ideal, but it was better than this place.</p><p>\u201cWhy not use the elevator?\u201d he asked as he noticed her starting to limp. Her hand, which had previously glided over the banister with barely a touch, started to grip it with each step up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOut of order,\u201d she grunted.</p><p>\u201cOf course it is.\u201d He couldn\u2019t bite back the sarcasm and immediately regretted it when her back straightened. He had put her even more on the defensive than she had been before. When she finally reached her front door, she was slightly out of breath.</p><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t get easier, you know,\u201d he said, striving to sound gentle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business,\u201d she snapped. Her hair was starting to fall out of the absurd little ponytail she had it in, and he noted that the pink tips had been replaced by pale blue ones. A few of the blue strands were peppered through her bangs as well.</p> <p>She unlocked her door, and when she stepped aside to allow him entry, he waved her forward. He followed her in and immediately spotted the huge blond guy from the airport seated at the kitchen table, digging into a bowl of cereal.</p><p>Instantly beyond furious and feeling absolutely gullible, Dante\u2019s first thought was that she\u2019d duped him. This was, as he had initially suspected, an elaborate ploy to make him believe some other guy\u2019s kid was his, and he\u2019d caught her red-handed. How was she going to explain this guy away?</p><p>He turned to face her, ready to give it to her with both barrels, when the annoyed\u2014not guilty, not defensive, not even scared\u2014expression on her face gave him pause.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re eating my Frostees!\u201d Cleo screeched, and Cal dropped his spoon guiltily.</p><p>\u201cIt was just a taste, I swear, hon. You know I\u2019d never eat too much of the stuff; it\u2019s hugely calorific. Well, hello.\u201d His gaze drifted behind her, and Cleo became aware of the man standing so close by.</p> <p>\u201cCal, this is Dante Damaso, my ex-boss. Mr. Damaso, my roommate, Callum Faris.\u201d Cal got up and sauntered over to them where he presented his hand to Dante, who gave it a firm shake.</p><p>\u201cYou can call me Cal,\u201d her shamelessly flirting roommate invited. \u201cOr just call me anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCal,\u201d she hissed, and he rolled his eyes. \u201cDo you mind giving us some privacy? Mr. Damaso and I have a few things to discuss.\u201d</p><p>Cal pouted before grabbing up a denim jacket and heading toward the door.</p><p>\u201cBe good to my girl, Mr. D,\u201d he said on his way out. \u201cI know about five different forms of martial arts, and I\u2019m not afraid to use them.\u201d Cleo felt a spurt of affection for her friend who, while a flirtatious lech, still knew exactly where his loyalties lay.</p><p>They watched him leave, and silence reigned for a few seconds before Cleo darted a quick look at Dante. He had a bemused expression on his face. She grinned.</p> <p>\u201cYou totally thought he was my baby daddy,\u201d she said, and he had the grace to look completely uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cFor a moment there, I thought I\u2019d been . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cConned?\u201d she guessed, and when he flashed her an annoyed look, she remembered that he didn\u2019t like it when she finished his sentences.</p><p>\u201cDuped,\u201d he corrected, and she snorted.</p><p>\u201cCome on, you\u2019ve got to give me that one, they mean the same thing,\u201d she groused, and he cleared his throat but didn\u2019t respond. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m offended your sordid little mind went there immediately despite the paternity-test results you got today. You have a seriously low opinion of me.\u201d</p><p>He kept his gaze impassive.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No apology?\u201d she challenged, and his jaw clenched but he remained stoically silent. She shrugged, letting it go because the sooner he was out of here, the better for her.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you want to talk about that couldn\u2019t be handled by our attorneys?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to inform you that I would pay for your medical costs as well,\u201d he explained, and she started shaking her head before the words were even completely formed.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t need any medical care if you weren\u2019t pregnant, and you wouldn\u2019t be pregnant if not for me. Therefore, the medical bills should fall to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want anything from you,\u201d she said as she shrugged out of her jacket and unzipped her fleecy, gray hoodie.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d he asked angrily. \u201cEverybody else does. Why don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not everybody else,\u201d she said quietly. In that instant she felt her heart break a little for him. How did that feel? To know that people cultivated relationships or friendships with you solely because of what it might get them. She was starting to understand why he\u2019d become such firm friends with Luc. Her brother was one of the least materialistic people she knew. Sure, he wanted the finer things in life, like everybody else, but he would work his heart out to obtain those things and never expect them to be handed to him on a plate. \u201cAnd FYI, you seem to know some seriously shitty people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ll leave you alone if you let me do this one thing for you, okay?\u201d he promised. \u201cJust let me take care of the medical bills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I need any additional procedures that would cost more than I\u2019d anticipated, if I need to stay in the hospital, or if there are complications that require additional medical treatment, I will happily accept your financial assistance,\u201d she stipulated, but he still didn\u2019t look happy.</p><p>\u201cAll of it, Cleo,\u201d he maintained. \u201cGive your doctor\u2019s details to Mike, and he\u2019ll take care of everything. I\u2019ve already added the clause to our agreement. If you don\u2019t cooperate, I will make an educated guess as to the possible costs incurred and have Mike transfer the funds into your account on a monthly basis. Once transferred, it cannot be returned. You can then do whatever the hell you want to with the money.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She crossed her arms, drawing his attention to her chest, and sighed in defeat.</p><p>\u201cFine.

Now, maybe you can tell me what the hell you\u2019re wearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cleo glanced down at herself and realized that with the hoodie unzipped, he could see the top of her leotard. \u201cOh. It\u2019s a leotard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLeotard? For dancing or gymnastics?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat explains it,\u201d he murmured beneath his breath, and she tilted her head curiously.</p><p>\u201cExplains what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. It\u2019s nothing. What kind of dance?\u201d</p> <p>She hesitated as she debated whether to encourage this conversation any further.</p><p>\u201cBallet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d He sounded so shocked that she was a little affronted.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you expecting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, with your personality I was expecting something more modern and quirky, perhaps. Ballet is . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cRefined?\u201d she snapped, on the defensive again.</p> <p>\u201cNot what I was going to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElegant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Cleo!\u201d It was the first time her name had ever flowed from his lips so naturally, and it startled her into silence. He didn\u2019t seem aware that he\u2019d used it and was still glaring at her. \u201cI told you not to do that. I was going to say stuffy. Ballet is so stuffy. It\u2019s beautiful, but it has so many rigid lines and rules. It doesn\u2019t seem to match your personality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me, Mr. Damaso,\u201d she reminded again.</p><p>\u201cI know enough,\u201d he disagreed almost gently.</p><p>\u201cYour five minutes are up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed they are.\u201d He walked toward the door, and she watched him from the center of the room. Once at the door, he turned to face her.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering about week fourteen,\u201d he confessed, his voice so low she barely caught it. He kept his eyes downcast, as if embarrassed to meet her gaze.</p> <p>\u201cWeek fourteen?\u201d she repeated, buying time, not sure if she should answer him or not.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened after the fists and the eyelids?\u201d He sounded like a wistful little boy wanting to know the end of a fairy tale, and it would have taken a stronger person than Cleo to resist the appeal of that little boy.</p><p>\u201cLast week he started urinating,\u201d she said, wrinkling her nose, still a bit creeped out by the idea. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of gross to imagine him peeing away in there. Oh, and he has his own fingerprints now. This week he\u2019s starting to make little faces.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at the thought.</p><p>\u201cSquints and frowns,\u201d she giggled. \u201cHe\u2019s probably paying special attention to getting that frown just right, considering who his father is.\u201d The words gave her pause as she remembered that her baby wouldn\u2019t know who his father was. She kept her eyes averted as she tried to keep her sadness at bay. She\u2019d also grown up not knowing her father and had always wanted more for her children.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, this is all guesswork. We could be a week off. I\u2019ll know for sure on Wednesday when I go for an ultrasound. They\u2019ll be able to give me a more accurate estimate of when he was conceived and when his date of birth will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill they be able to tell you if it\u2019s a girl or boy?\u201d he asked, and she shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Some of the articles I\u2019ve read indicate that they can tell by twelve weeks, while other sources state that sixteen weeks is standard practice. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to know, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose Lucius will be going with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuc and Blue are working,\u201d she said unthinkingly, and his eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cCallum, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Cal will go,\u201d she said airily, and his eyes narrowed suspiciously. \u201cAnyway . . . I have some stuff to take care of. So I\u2019ll say good-bye now. I\u2019m sure Mr. Grayson has my lawyer\u2019s number.\u201d</p><p>She reached out a hand, and he enveloped it with his. She shook his hand in one decisive up-and-down movement, but he refused to release his grip afterward.</p><p>\u201cGood luck with your hotel in Tokyo. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be beautiful.\u201d She didn\u2019t really know what else to say and wished he\u2019d free her hand, but he didn\u2019t seem to have any inclination to do so.</p><p>\u201cDoes Lucius know the identity of your child\u2019s father?\u201d he asked unexpectedly.</p><p>\u201cNo. And I\u2019d rather he didn\u2019t know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he values your friendship, and even though I can\u2019t see what he finds so appealing about you, he doesn\u2019t have many friends, and I wouldn\u2019t want to deprive him of one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou once found me very appealing,\u201d he reminded huskily.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Dante?\u201d she asked in a helpless little voice, and he looked as confused as she felt. It was the most vulnerable she\u2019d ever seen him look.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted quietly. \u201cI have no clue what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer and tugged her toward him until her chest was flush against his torso. He finally released her hand, only to cup her face in his palms, as if she was the most precious thing he\u2019d ever beheld.</p><p>\u201cMaybe just a good-bye,\u201d he whispered. \u201cCan I say good-bye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word carried no weight and floated between them as light as a feather, and he caught it on her lips before it could properly float away. His kiss was gentle and felt alarmingly reverent, and Cleo was floored by it. He shouldn\u2019t be doing this, and she shouldn\u2019t be allowing it. It complicated things. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She captured his wrists in her hands, intending to tug his hands down, but she couldn\u2019t find the strength to do so.

Whatever this was.</p><p>Cleo finally found the strength to jerk her head back, breaking the contact between them. Her breath came in gasps, and her body was shaking badly. A quick glance at him confirmed that he was as shaken and shocked as she.</p><p>\u201cThat was . . . it was . . .\u201d She shook her head, frustrated with her inability to verbalize her thoughts. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Dante.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d He ran a shaky hand through his hair. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have happened.

After one slight hitch, his life was smoothly on track again.</p><p>Dante\u2019s phone buzzed as he stepped into his apartment, and he groaned when he saw the message\u2014in Spanish\u2014that had popped up onto his screen:</p> <p>Must Skype immediately, Papa</p><p>Great, just what he needed after an already difficult day. He headed up to his study and set up the Skype call. He had other, more efficient means of making face-time calls, but his father couldn\u2019t quite grasp the technology involved. This was the easiest method for the older man. Dante really only used this program to contact his father, and as such, the man was the only contact on his list. Which made it easy to spot that Enrique Damaso was already online. As soon as Dante was logged in, the familiar ringtone came up. His father really was in a rush to speak with him tonight. The last time they\u2019d Skyped had been months before.</p><p>\u201cAh, Dante. It\u2019s good to see you, son,\u201d his father said in Spanish as soon as they were connected. \u201cYou are good? You look good.\u201d</p><p>Dante was so far removed from good that it was actually quite funny, but he merely nodded.</p><p>\u201cAll good here, Papa,\u201d he lied. Their relationship wasn\u2019t one that encouraged confidences.</p><p>\u201cAh. Wonderful,\u201d the man said jovially. \u201cListen, Dante, I have someone I want you to meet.\u201d He ushered someone off-camera to join him, and a stunning young brunette stepped into view and sat down on his father\u2019s lap. Dante sighed inwardly, already knowing where this would lead.</p> <p>\u201cDante, this is Carmen, your new mama-to-be.\u201d Dante tried not to wince at the introduction; the girl looked a full decade younger than Dante\u2019s own thirty-two. \u201cCarmen, this is my boy, Dante.\u201d</p><p>He planted a kiss on the giggling woman\u2019s cheek and did something\u2014thankfully out of the camera\u2019s view\u2014to make her squeal.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting married,\u201d he announced unnecessarily. \u201cCarmen is the one, Dante. She makes your papa so happy.\u201d And the sixty-three-year-old man was probably going through shedloads of little blue pills and truckloads of pretty trinkets to keep her equally happy.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Dante said woodenly, knowing from experience that trying to talk his father out of making yet another colossal error would simply end in failure\u2014much like the marriage itself inevitably would. His father\u2019s marriages never ended amicably, and each divorce had involved protracted and ugly legal battles. But it was useless reminding his father of past mistakes; it was easier to just make polite noises, buy a gift, and stay the hell out of it.</p><p>The old man was both cynical and a hopeless romantic. He hated all his exes with a bitterness that had easily poisoned Dante\u2019s own mind against women, and yet he loved every new opportunistic bitch that flitted her way into his life with a passion that was borderline obsessive.</p><p>\u201cWill you come to the wedding?\u201d his father asked eagerly. \u201cCarmen and I are having a beach wedding in Tenerife. Carmen wanted the most romantic destination. And I will give my beautiful Carmen everything she wants. Also, I think it\u2019s closer to you, right? Off the African coast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s northwest Africa, Papa. I\u2019m in South Africa. Pretty far away.\u201d Dante tested his acting skills by pulling the most regretful expression he could muster out of the bag. Clearly, geography was not his father\u2019s strong suit. But the old man had never understood why his only son had chosen to move so far away, and because he was still waiting for Dante to \u201ccome to his senses,\u201d he hadn\u2019t really bothered to learn much about the place that had become Dante\u2019s adopted home.</p><p>\u201cI sometimes regret sending you to that university when you were a boy, Dante,\u201d his father said with a shake of his head. It was a familiar refrain. \u201cBut I thought, let the boy go, he can learn to be a man far away from his home and comfort. But then you had to go and live there.\u201d</p> <p>Enrique Damaso felt that Dante going to college in another country, far away from everything familiar to him, would be a good character-building experience. And the old man had happily handed over the reins of the company immediately after Dante received his MBA, but his father hadn\u2019t counted on Dante staying in that country and forging a completely new life. Worse, Dante had \u201crebooted\u201d the Damaso hotel brand in Cape Town and had completely distanced himself from his father\u2019s influence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow you\u2019re so far away you can\u2019t visit your old papa regularly. All because I wanted my boy to have a good education and some valuable life experience,\u201d he said despairingly, but Dante remained unmoved by the theatrics. It was a little act his father liked to put on for the benefit of his future brides. The old Look at how devoted I am to my ungrateful and uncaring only child shtick.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to make it to the wedding, Papa,\u201d Dante interrupted firmly, knowing his father could go on for ages about what an ungrateful son he had. Best to nip it in the bud now. \u201cI\u2019m completely swamped with work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know when it is,\u201d his father pointed out, and Dante suppressed a scowl at the rookie mistake. But he was happy to have diverted the conversation away from his own shortcomings, at least.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I assumed it was soon,\u201d he backpedaled quickly. \u201cI\u2019m tied up with the Tokyo build, and you know the Dubai project is starting to gain momentum. Now wouldn\u2019t be a great time to take a vacation. But, of course, if you\u2019re talking about months down the line, I\u2019d be happy to attend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAah, no . . . we\u2019re in love, we cannot wait months. The wedding will be in two weeks,\u201d his father said with a regretful sigh. \u201cI really wanted you there, son. I was hoping you could be my best man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Papa,\u201d he repeated. Carmen pouted prettily. \u201cAnd Carmen. I would come if I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Dante,\u201d she giggled, her voice painfully shrill. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be plenty of time to get to know each other in the future.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, right. Dante wouldn\u2019t bet on that. His father would be on to wife number next in no time. Dante had lost count of how many\u2014progressively younger\u2014stepmothers he\u2019d had so far, and he had no interest in even trying to keep track of them. His father never kept mistresses or lovers, he kept wives, and out of the many he\u2019d had after Dante\u2019s mother had died of leukemia, one had committed suicide, another had died of an accidental drug overdose, and the rest had all divorced him.</p><p>Thankfully, Dante didn\u2019t have dozens of half siblings scattered all over Europe, as his father had had a vasectomy after Dante\u2019s tenth birthday. Which was a mixed blessing, since Dante wouldn\u2019t have minded a brother or sister. It would have made his childhood a little less lonely.</p> <p>He watched his father neck with his child bride for a few minutes longer before deciding that he\u2019d done his familial duty.</p><p>\u201cWell, congratulations again. Please send me the wedding pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. It was great talking with you, son. We should touch base more often,\u201d his father said. The man ended every call with the same words, and Dante always agreed that they should, but they both knew they probably wouldn\u2019t talk again for months. They were both okay with that.</p><p>After ending the call, Dante wandered from room to room in his vast penthouse apartment, which overlooked the yacht basin at the V and A Waterfront in Cape Town. It was the perfect bachelor apartment and offered a less impersonal way of life than simply staying in one of his hotels, which was the way he\u2019d lived up until his thirtieth birthday. That was when he bought himself this multi-million-dollar gem just a stone\u2019s throw away from both his office and his flagship hotel in Cape Town.</p><p>But the Waterfront wasn\u2019t exactly a peaceful environment; it was trendy, noisy, and bustling with sightseers. The property values were through the roof, and it had been a sound investment to purchase this apartment. The glossy finishes, marble floors, slick glass walls, and minimalist interior were designed by the same team that did all of his hotels. The d\u00e9cor was beautiful but left the place feeling sterile and cold. He often felt as if he was still living in a hotel or one of those places they use for interior-design catalog shoots. It didn\u2019t feel like home. Not that he\u2019d ever known what one of those felt like.</p><p>When he\u2019d been a child living at home with his father, he\u2019d never felt a sense of permanence or place. Not with the interchangeable \u201cmamas\u201d traipsing through Dante\u2019s life from his sixth or seventh birthday onward.</p> <p>Because Enrique Damaso believed that each new wife was the Real Thing, he\u2019d never seen the necessity of a prenup. For a wealthy man, Dante\u2019s father could be incredibly stupid. He thought prenups were unromantic and set the wrong tone for a marriage, and with each ex-wife he lost sizable chunks of money. Only one of those ex-wives had remarried and no longer received alimony from him; the others still enjoyed their lavish lifestyles, thanks to his father\u2019s gullibility.</p><p>Dante had given up thinking that his father would ever learn his lesson, and had proceeded to protect himself against a similar fate. He\u2019d seen what loving a woman could lead to, and he wasn\u2019t going to allow himself to be used like that. He would choose his future wife with care; she would come from a background of wealth and privilege and would comport herself with grace and dignity in public. There would be no mad, passionate love involved in his choice. It would be an intellectual process, not an emotional one.</p><p>He wandered out onto the balcony and stared down at the yachts neatly lined up in the bay beneath his apartment, their masts pointing up at the purple-and-pink dusk sky like accusatory, skeletal middle fingers. His own fifty-foot sloop was berthed down there, but from this distance, in the fading light, it was difficult to spot the Arabella, which he\u2019d named after his first dog.</p><p>He could smell the faint scent of fried food drifting toward him on the breeze, hear distant laughter\u2014carried to him on the same breeze\u2014and see people wandering around on the dock. Just living their lives. Some happy, some not. Husbands and wives, lovers, families. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sighed, trying to shove aside the uncharacteristic surge of melancholia. He needed to shake this off. He needed a beer and time with a friend. The only person who sprang to mind was probably the last person he should contact. How the hell was he supposed to look Lucius in the eye after learning that Cleo was pregnant with his baby? She had inexplicably attempted to preserve his friendship with her brother, and Dante supposed he could be grateful for that. Still, facing Lucius on the same day he\u2019d received the paternity-test results wasn\u2019t something Dante was prepared to deal with just yet.</p><p>He mixed himself a strong drink, indulging himself with a couple of fingers of twenty-year-old single-malt scotch on the rocks. He carried his tumbler out onto the balcony and sat down in one of his comfortable patio chairs with his bare feet propped up against the railing. The sky had gone a deep, velvety blue, with just a few hints of magenta still bleeding into the ocean on the horizon.</p><p>He dug his phone from his pocket and scrolled through his messages and e-mails, and after replying to a few of the semi-important ones, he gave in to temptation and Googled week-by-week pregnancy guides.</p><p>He was fascinated to learn that peeing and making faces weren\u2019t all that week fourteen had to offer. The baby had also developed a pelt of hair all over its body. Dante couldn\u2019t help but visualize a weird simian-looking thing curled up in Cleo\u2019s womb. He shuddered and continued to read. He wondered if she could see any difference in her body yet? She still looked exactly the same to him, and the top of that leotard had been quite form-fitting, so surely he would have noticed any swelling in her midsection. Maybe her breasts had been a little bigger? He couldn\u2019t be sure; the leotard had unfortunately flattened them a bit too much for his liking.</p> <p>And why had he even been looking at her breasts in the first place? Why was he thinking about them now?</p><p>His thoughts drifted to her ultrasound and wondered what the baby would look like.</p><p>He tilted his head back and imagined a little girl with black hair and snapping emerald eyes like her mother\u2019s. He had no experience with kids, and for some reason he couldn\u2019t quite picture an infant. In his mind the child was a toddler, two or three, wearing a little pink tutu and white leggings. He could see her clumsily twirling until she got dizzy, and when she inevitably lost her balance, he was there to . . .</p><p>He sat up abruptly, feet hitting the deck and drink nearly spilling.</p><p>Mierda! What the hell was he doing fantasizing about some kid who would have no place in his life?</p> <p>He tossed back his drink and hurried inside to change into his loose training shorts. He needed a good workout. He needed to straighten his head out.</p><p>He padded, on bare feet, into his private gym and warmed up with a vigorous jump-rope session and a few stretches before dragging on his boxing gloves and proceeding to beat and kick the hell out of the heavy punching bag suspended from the ceiling. Less than half an hour later, he was too mentally and physically wrung out to think about anything other than the abuse he was putting his body through, and after his workout was complete, the only things on his mind were shower and sleep.</p><p>Not Cleo and her inconvenient pregnancy.</p><p>He was done with that.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>\u201cHeeey!\u201d A super chirpy voice screeched into Cleo\u2019s ear and she cringed slightly. \u201cGuess who\u2019s back in town?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHi, Coco,\u201d she said faintly, one eye still defensively squeezed shut as her brain tried to adjust to the sugar rush Coco\u2019s high-pitched, syrupy voice always sent screaming through her bloodstream. \u201cWhen did you get back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night! Did you miss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d And she meant it. Coco had been one of her best friends throughout dance school, and even though they\u2019d drifted apart after Cleo\u2019s accident, she always made a point of visiting whenever she was in town. She was a member of a well-known dance troupe and had even been doing a few solos on their international tours. Cleo had always been a better dancer than Coco, and they both knew it, so Cleo couldn\u2019t help feeling envious of her friend, which made things awkward between them, so it was probably a good thing they rarely saw each other these days.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m back, and so\u2019s Gigi,\u201d she squeaked, while Gigi\u2019s equally high-pitched voice screeched a hello in the background. Gigi was another former classmate of theirs, a ditzy girl who was happy just being in the corps de ballet. She simply wanted to dance and receive a regular paycheck. She was also one of the nicest people Cleo knew. \u201cWant to come out for a drinkie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will you guys be in town?\u201d Cleo asked, glancing at the clock. It was nearly eight in the evening, and she had her ultrasound in the morning. Not the best time to be going out.</p><p>\u201cFor a couple of weeks,\u201d Coco replied.</p><p>\u201cGreat, then can I take a rain check? I really can\u2019t make it tonight. I have an important appointment tomorrow,\u201d she said, genuine regret deepening her voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat about tomorrow night?\u201d Coco asked.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be cool. Sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay! I\u2019ll text you the deets! See you then!\u201d Coco always spoke in exclamations; it was a little draining chatting with her sometimes, especially without any forewarning.</p><p>Cleo headed into the living room, where Cal was stretched out on the sleeper couch. His glasses, which he was too vain to let anyone but her see him wear, were perched on his nose as he read one of the gory thrillers that he loved. He peered up at her over the top of his glasses as she went to the kitchen to get herself some juice.</p><p>\u201cCoco and Gigi are back in town,\u201d she said after sitting down at the kitchen table and taking a sip of her drink. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he muttered. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to take an insulin shot before you go out with the Saccharine Sisters.\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cStop it,\u201d she admonished, her laughter belying her words. Cal and Coco didn\u2019t get along, not since they\u2019d both fallen for the same guy a few years back. To make matters worse, the guy had gone for Coco despite the fact that Cal was still convinced\u2014all evidence to the contrary\u2014that the guy batted for his team.</p><p>Cleo\u2019s laughter faded as she continued to stare at her longtime friend. She had to tell him about her decision to move in with Luc and Blue; he would need time to make other arrangements.</p><p>\u201cCal?\u201d she whispered, hating the necessity of what she had to do but not seeing any other way. He dropped his book to his chest and smiled at her sadly.</p> <p>\u201cI know, hon.\u201d Her eyes flooded with tears at the understanding on his face, and she sat hunched at the table, silent sobs shaking her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I don\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to do what\u2019s best for you, Cleo. And right now, you can\u2019t afford to live here supporting my lazy ass and coping with a pregnancy too. But on the positive side, having to move out might light a fire under said lazy ass and get me motivated to find work again. I\u2019ve been getting a little too comfortable here, you see? Living a life of leisure, like the kept man that I am.\u201d</p><p>They both glanced around the tiny apartment and laughed at the thought of living any kind of \u201clife of leisure\u201d in the place.</p><p>\u201cHow long do we still have before we leave this pleasure palace?\u201d He got up and stretched lazily before sauntering over to give her a casual hug and hand her a sliver of paper towel, the last bit on the roll.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re out of paper towels,\u201d he noted, and she giggled messily as she blew her nose.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re not replacing this roll. Our life of lavish spending has come to an end, my friend. We can no longer afford luxuries like paper towels.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and sat down at the table opposite her.</p><p>\u201cJeez, girl, I\u2019m getting sick of seeing you cry. Cheer up, will you?\u201d She bravely presented him with her best smile. \u201cBetter. But not by much. Now when do we move out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be speaking with the landlord tomorrow. So probably thirty more days before we have to vacate the premises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot can happen in thirty days,\u201d he observed.</p> <p>\u201cNot that much.\u201d She traced a crease on the plastic tablecloth with her finger. \u201cDo you want to come with me to my ultrasound appointment tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well, two\u2019s company but three is most definitely a party,\u201d Cal observed the following morning as they climbed out of her car. Cleo was happy with the prime parking spot they\u2019d found directly outside Dr. Klein\u2019s office and was grinning like an idiot when she glanced up to see what Cal was talking about. The smile immediately dropped from her face when she saw what he was referring to.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d she whispered beneath her breath. \u201cWhy is he here? How is he here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a deep breath, Cleo,\u201d Cal advised softly. \u201cYou\u2019re never at your sharpest when you\u2019re pissed off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d She marched up to Dante and put her face right up to his. \u201cHow did you know where to find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sent your OB/GYN\u2019s details to Grayson, and with that information in hand it was easy finding out the time of your appointment,\u201d he revealed insouciantly. Her jaw dropped at that blatant invasion of her privacy. Those details should never have been used to spy on her! \u201cI thought I\u2019d come along and see what I\u2019m paying for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to pay for it,\u201d she reminded.</p> <p>\u201cLook, I know I was an arrogant asshole before,\u201d he said evenly.</p><p>\u201cWas?\u201d she asked, her eyebrows rising. He merely gave her one of those long, level looks that made her feel completely chastised. She hated that. \u201cDante, I don\u2019t see what else we need to discuss. We had an agreement. Two, in fact. Remember? I signed yours and you signed mine. That makes us even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve recently come to appreciate that our previous agreement might not be exactly what I want.\u201d</p><p>No, he was not doing this to her right now. Cleo tried not to panic as she kept her voice firm and her words succinct.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s what I want,\u201d she said curtly. \u201cDiscussion closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have to be so damned stubborn and difficult all the time?\u201d he seethed.</p><p>\u201cYes. Look where being easy got me. Knocked up and alone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be alone. I have decided that I would not mind sharing this experience with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough! We don\u2019t get convenient do-overs in life, Dante. This has been settled before, and just because you suddenly developed a latent paternal instinct doesn\u2019t mean I have to accept that. You have absolutely no right to insert yourself in here like you have some kind of stake in all of this. Stop stalking me and get the hell out of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d he growled, taking hold of her arm firmly. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. I said no. You\u2019ve been calling the shots from the beginning. You sprang this on me, and I barely had time to think about what it all meant before there were papers being shoved at me to sign. Sure, it all sounded great at the time\u2014just sign on the dotted line and for a small fee you and kid disappear as if neither of you had ever existed. No fuss, no mess.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLegal documents being shoved at you without warning?

He\u2019s not yours; he\u2019ll never be yours.\u201d Her hand dropped to her abdomen defensively, and his eyes darkened at the movement.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to take him from you, I just . . . I want to be there. I want to see him. I want to know him, and I want him to know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat changed? How could everything just change overnight?\u201d Her voice rose almost hysterically, and she felt Cal\u2019s arm curl around her shoulder protectively.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019d better get going, bud,\u201d Cal warned.</p><p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with you, Mr. Faris. It\u2019s between Cleo and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know what\u2019s changed!\u201d she screeched, demanding to be heard and uncaring of the bystanders who paused on the street to glance at the unfolding tableau. If Dante Damaso insisted on doing this in public, then he would damn well get a scene.</p><p>\u201cI have!\u201d he snapped. \u201cI\u2019ve changed. I can\u2019t stop thinking about this baby. In my head she\u2019s a dark-haired, green-eyed little princess in a pink tutu and white leggings, and she\u2019s been toddling in and out of my dreams since Monday.\u201d</p> <p>That made her pause and look at him. Really look.</p><p>His tie was crooked, she noted absently, one white cuff stuck out slightly longer than the other, one of his shirt buttons wasn\u2019t fastened, his hair looked like he\u2019d repeatedly run his fingers through it all morning, and he\u2019d cut himself shaving that morning. Dante Damaso looked . . . undone. He looked like a man who no longer had a handle on his life.</p><p>\u201cIn my mind he has dark hair, your golden eyes, as well as your mouth and jaw, and he\u2019s wearing the world\u2019s smallest little sheriff\u2019s uniform. He can\u2019t walk yet, but he\u2019s grinning a big, droolly, toothless grin.\u201d</p><p>They were both silent for a moment, and her shoulders dropped.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted, which was quite a confession for the usually self-assured Dante Damaso to make. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d be a great dad. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll be lousy at it.\u201d</p><p>It so closely resembled her own fears about the type of mother she\u2019d be that she was staggered by the lack of self-confidence from a man who always seemed to know exactly what to do.</p><p>\u201cBut I was hoping to be . . . someone she knows?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is such a huge change of heart, Dante, and it isn\u2019t at all what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. I\u2019m just asking that you allow me to properly take care of her, and that I get to see her sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does \u2018properly take care of her\u2019 entail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust fund, private schools, decent living conditions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re trying to dictate my life and the way I raise my child.\u201d</p><p>He just stared at her and kept his face frustratingly blank.</p><p>\u201cDoes this have to be done right now?\u201d Cal asked pointedly, and they both looked at him in surprise, having completely forgotten his presence. He rolled his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to rain. And you, miss, have an appointment that you\u2019re going to be late for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, crap,\u201d she muttered, before tossing a sideways glance at Dante, who stared back at her with an uncharacteristically hangdog expression.</p><p>\u201cDante, you can\u2019t show up here, tell me you\u2019ve had a change of heart, and expect me to just be okay with that,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you at my ultrasound. I don\u2019t think I want to share something so . . . intimate with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re having my kid, lady,\u201d he reminded, and Cal snorted. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get much more intimate than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCal\u2019s going in with me,\u201d she maintained.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to.\u201d Cal shrugged. He kept his eyes on his nails and ignored the murderous glare Cleo threw at him. \u201cI\u2019m squeamish. Blood makes me nauseous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood?\u201d Now Dante looked a tad green, and Cleo wanted to scream in frustration.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no blood involved. Cal, you\u2019re coming with me.\u201d She pointed an assertive finger at Dante. \u201cYou can wait for us, I\u2019ll . . . I\u2019ll see if they can make you a copy of the DVD or something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>What the hell am I doing here? Dante sat hunched in a small, uncomfortable plastic chair, surrounded by women in various stages of pregnancy. They were all openly staring at him, probably wondering why he was lurking about in an OB/GYN\u2019s reception room without a pregnant woman nearby. He didn\u2019t understand the thought process that had brought him here this morning. All he knew was that at random times over the past forty-eight hours, that tiny, toddling ballerina with the charming smile and sparkling green eyes had crept into his thoughts and had made him wonder, fantasize, and aspire to be more.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t sure how much more he could, or wanted to, be. He and Cleo were strangers now forever bonded by circumstance. He couldn\u2019t pretend that there was anything more than that between them. What he knew about the woman could fill a thimble, and he really had no wish to get to know her, but he had discovered a weird desire within himself to know that baby. As a result, he would have to find a way to work out an amicable arrangement with Cleo.</p> <p>He had closed more difficult deals than this in the past. Every problem had a solution, and he was confident he would find the solution for this problem too. He just had to find a way to convince Cleo that his way was the best course of action.</p><p>If only he knew what the hell his way was.</p><p>\u201cHe drives me crazy,\u201d Cleo complained to Cal as she lay down on the examination table as per the ultrasound technician\u2019s instructions.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think about him now,\u201d Cal said. \u201cYou\u2019re about to see your baby for the first time. Where\u2019s your sense of awe and occasion?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes misted over at Cal\u2019s words, and she felt guilty for her initial reluctance to have him join her for this. He sometimes said and did the perfect thing at the perfect time. She should be excited, she should be awed, she\u2019d been waiting for this moment since she\u2019d decided to keep her baby, and Dante Damaso was not going to ruin it for her.</p> <p>She reached for Cal\u2019s hand, offering him a watery smile as the technician applied the cold gel to her abdomen and stomach. She sucked in a breath at the unpleasant sensation.</p><p>\u201cThis is the transducer,\u201d the technician, Julia, explained as she held up the wand. \u201cI\u2019ll run it over your tummy to capture the images. I\u2019ll measure the fetus\u2019s size today so that we can more accurately estimate the due date. We\u2019ll check Baby\u2019s heartbeat, make sure everything\u2019s in order and . . . do you want to know the sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cleo said, decisively. \u201cI want to be surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Julia smiled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push down too hard with that thing, okay?\u201d Cleo warned, and the other woman chuckled. \u201cMy bladder\u2019s about to burst.\u201d She wasn\u2019t feeling very comfortable at all, thanks to all the water she\u2019d had to drink over the last hour in preparation for the test.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how often I get that warning,\u201d Julia replied. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Cleo nodded and watched as she lowered the wand. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>Julia\u2019s hand stopped its descent just an inch away from her belly, and Cleo sighed. She was such a sucker.</p><p>\u201cCal,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMaybe we should . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to fetch him?\u201d Cal asked.</p><p>\u201cWould it be okay if we got someone else in here?\u201d she asked Julia, whose eyebrows rose before she shrugged and nodded. \u201cCal, tell him he doesn\u2019t get to speak. He gets to stand quietly at the door while I pretend he\u2019s not there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMature,\u201d Cal muttered.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d she responded without heat. It didn\u2019t feel right to leave Dante sitting out there, even though she still didn\u2019t want him involved in her pregnancy. She was so confused and really just acting on a gut instinct right now. After all, her own reaction upon learning of her pregnancy had also been disbelief followed by a complete and utter rejection of the very idea of a baby, but she\u2019d changed her mind and nobody had judged her for it. Was it really so inconceivable that perhaps Dante also, after getting over the initial shock, now had similar feelings?</p><p>He had signed papers basically renouncing his right to this child, but would it be fair to enforce that document? It wasn\u2019t just Dante she had to consider. She had to do the mature thing and think about her baby as well. Surely having Dante around would do more good than harm?</p> <p>The door opened and Cal came in with Dante trailing meekly behind him. Cleo heard Julia\u2019s breath catch slightly at the sight of him and felt a little sorry for her. Dante Damaso\u2019s overwhelming physical presence was hard to take without advance warning. Just standing there, trying desperately to look timid and unassuming, he exuded sexual magnetism and supreme self-confidence. Seriously, it was like someone had set a leopard in among the house cats, and it turned Julia into a giggly girl.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Julia squeaked, self-consciously pushing a strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cAre we ready now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, go ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Julia was all business again, despite the flush highlighting her cheekbones. \u201cLet\u2019s see what we can see.\u201d</p><p>She shifted the wand about, pausing in some places, skirting over others, and Cleo, Cal, and Dante all stared at the monitor in fascination as the grainy image began to form right in front of their eyes.</p><p>\u201cAh, there we go, beautiful . . . Look at that little heart beating away.\u201d She pointed to a blurry, twitching smudge on the screen and smiled, taking a couple of notes before looking back up. \u201cThere\u2019s the forehead. And down here\u2019s where the nose is forming. Look at that little jaw and mouth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It looked like nothing human to Cleo, and much as she squinted and twisted her head this way and that, the picture made no sense to her.</p><p>\u201cLooks like an alien.\u201d Cal shrugged, unimpressed.</p><p>\u201cAre those arms and legs?\u201d He Who Should Have Remained Silent asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Julia pointed to a couple of white blobs on the monitor, and suddenly the image took shape and made sense to Cleo. She gasped and her hands flew to her mouth as she really saw her baby for the first time.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d The shaky exhalation came from Dante, who was staring at the monitor as an expression that could only be described as absolute wonder lit up his handsome features. His eyes drifted to Cleo\u2019s and held them. He seemed to be telling her something, and in the midst of all the joy and awe, a distinct chill settled in Cleo\u2019s chest. He looked determined. As if seeing the baby\u2019s image had served to strengthen an unknown resolve. And for the first time, Cleo knew that if Dante decided he wanted this child, no force in heaven or hell would stop him. All her precautions and cleverly worded legal documents meant nothing to a man with his resources.</p><p>She felt like a complete fool for allowing him back into her life again.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s moving,\u201d Dante was saying, his voice trembling slightly. \u201cJesus, look at her wriggle. I never imagined her moving around in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, look at the ribs! Are those ribs?\u201d Cal asked, sounding a little more enthused now that he could see more.</p><p>\u201cCristo,\u201d Dante swore shakily. \u201cIt\u2019s so much clearer than I\u2019d imagined.\u201d</p> <p>He had moved a lot closer and was standing right next to the bed, his eyes glued to the monitor and his face rapt.</p><p>\u201cCan you determine the gender from this scan?\u201d Really, for someone who should have stood silently in the corner, he was starting to take over the appointment a little, and the only reason Cleo didn\u2019t warn him to back off was because she was interested in the answer.</p><p>\u201cSometimes we can tell at this age,\u201d Julia said. \u201cBut with this one it\u2019s a little hard to tell for certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd everything\u2019s okay?\u201d he asked, his attention still riveted to the monitor. He barely bothered to glance at Julia while asking the questions.</p><p>\u201cPerfectly fine, from what I can tell. That right there is a beautiful, healthy, thirteen-and-a-half-week-old fetus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirteen and a half? Not fourteen?\u201d he asked, and Julia nodded.</p> <p>Which meant that the baby had likely been conceived on their last or next-to-last night in Japan. He glanced up at Cleo, who caught his eye and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSo maybe she hasn\u2019t been practicing her frowns yet. But she has all of next week to work on those.\u201d His lips tilted upward at her words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking if it\u2019s a girl, you may want to consider naming her Daisy,\u201d he said, his eyes sparking with mischief, and she went fiery red as she recalled those damned Daisy Duck boy shorts he\u2019d been so taken with that last night.</p><p>\u201cNo comment,\u201d she replied, and his lips quirked at the corners as he looked back up at the monitor. Cleo\u2019s eyes lingered on his profile for a few moments longer, charmed\u2014despite herself\u2014at how very entranced he was by the wriggling image on that screen.</p><p>They spent another ten minutes exclaiming and marveling over the various features and body parts they could identity, while Julia took down the fetus\u2019s vital statistics and answered the myriad questions Dante seemed to have for her. He asked questions that would never even have occurred to Cleo.</p><p>Julia had gotten over that first fluttery reaction pretty quickly and now treated him the way she probably did most expectant fathers, giving each question a measured and intelligent response and never once showing the slightest sign of impatience.</p><p>All three of them were a little woebegone when she finally switched the monitor off and the baby\u2019s image disappeared.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s tough to say good-bye,\u201d Julia sympathized. \u201cBut I\u2019ll have a DVD and stills made for you. Well, your baby seems to be happy and healthy, Miss Knight. You can arrange next month\u2019s appointment with Dr. Klein at the reception desk. How many copies of the DVD would you like?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTwo,\u201d Dante replied before Cleo could respond, and Julia nodded and happily made arrangements with Dante for the delivery of the DVDs. Cleo couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit sidelined. She might be carrying the baby, but her pregnancy was rapidly becoming a Dante Damaso Production, and she was petrified that if she wasn\u2019t careful, he would find a way to marginalize her completely.</p><p>\u201cI have to pee,\u201d she whispered to Cal after she\u2019d made her next appointment at the reception desk. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the car.\u201d She handed him her car keys so that he wouldn\u2019t have to wait in the rain, and turned to Dante, who\u2019d watched the whispered exchanged in interest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you later,\u201d she told him. \u201cWe have to make arrangements to meet with our attorneys present about modifying our previous agreement.\u201d</p><p>She turned away to rush to the closest ladies\u2019 room, not waiting for him to acknowledge her words.</p><p>She half expected him to still be waiting for her when she finished five minutes later, and she was relieved to see no sign of him in the reception area upon her return. She waved to Viv, the receptionist, as she dragged on her lightweight denim jacket on her way out the door. She was so preoccupied with fixing one of her jacket sleeves that it took her a while to notice her car was missing. She glanced up and stopped in the middle of the sidewalk, still absently trying to force her arm into the jacket sleeve while she stared blankly at the spot where her car should have been. She frowned in confusion before glancing up and down the road. Maybe she was mistaken about where she\u2019d left it. There was no sign of the nondescript, faded-blue hatchback. Maybe Cal had moved it. But why would he? The spot had been ideal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was still trying to figure it out when a hand descended on her shoulder. She nearly jumped out of her skin in fright, and if she hadn\u2019t just emptied her bladder she would have embarrassed herself even further. She swung around to confront her accoster and only marginally relaxed when\u2014predictably\u2014Dante Damaso stood behind her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to scare you,\u201d he said apologetically.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Then stop sneaking up on me,\u201d she griped. She was still furiously trying to get her arm into the damned jacket when he took hold of her wrist and gently guided it into the errant sleeve. Dressing her like he would a small child.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you have something to do with Cal\u2019s disappearance,\u201d she said, once she had her jacket on properly.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to make it sound so ominous,\u201d he replied. \u201cI just told him that we needed to talk and that I\u2019d drive you home. Don\u2019t worry, he issued all the warnings a dutiful friend would but recognized that you and I have a few unresolved issues to take care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I suppose we\u2019d better get this over with, then.\u201d Cleo couldn\u2019t help the surliness that crept into her voice. She felt defensive and had wanted time to mentally and emotionally prepare for this discussion. \u201cWhere are you parked?\u201d</p><p>Dante watched Cleo animatedly chatting and laughing with James, his driver. They were discussing James\u2019s grandmother\u2019s chocolate fudge cake, which was apparently \u201cto die for.\u201d Although how the hell Cleo knew that was anybody\u2019s guess. She didn\u2019t look at Dante once during the drive, didn\u2019t make any conversation, not even to ask where they were going. Not one stray smile or misplaced comment spilled over in his direction, and he wasn\u2019t sure why, but that bothered the hell out of him. It was as if he wasn\u2019t even present.</p><p>Dante was not used to being so comprehensively ignored, so he did what he always did when a situation became awkward: he took out his cell phone to check messages and make calls. When he was working, he was in charge; he was never uncomfortable and knew how to handle every scenario that was thrown at him. It was a handy way to ignore difficult social situations. Still, this time he couldn\u2019t shut them out as completely as he would have liked; part of him wanted to weigh in on the buttercream versus fondant debate. He had very definite views when it came to cake, but Cleo wouldn\u2019t know that because she thought he was boring, stuffy, and overbearing. And maybe he was, but he could damned well discuss cake with her\u2014and anybody else\u2014any day of the week.</p><p>He stifled his childish thoughts and managed to complete a couple of important phone calls before their short drive ended. James rolled the car to a stop in an underground parking lot, and Cleo stopped talking and peered at her surroundings curiously. She\u2019d been so busy proving that she could ignore Dante that she hadn\u2019t really absorbed the direction they were heading during the short trip from the doctor\u2019s office.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d she asked, before seeing a familiar sign on one of the nearby tourist maps. \u201cAre we at the Waterfront?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose,\u201d he said, gathering his briefcase and phone while James stepped out of the car and opened the door for Cleo. Dante didn\u2019t bother waiting for the man to do the same for him and was at Cleo\u2019s side before she had properly emerged from the car.</p><p>\u201cClose? How close is close?\u201d Her voice was suspicious, and he stifled a smile. He liked this prickly side of her, even though it also frustrated the hell out of him.</p><p>\u201cClose enough.\u201d He kept his responses short and cryptic, partly because he knew it would piss her off, and partly because he didn\u2019t want her freaking out before he got her where he wanted her. \u201cI thought we could have a late lunch and talk.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, and he sighed before gently taking hold of her elbow.</p><p>\u201cCleo, try to trust me, okay? What the hell do you think I\u2019m going to do to you? We need to have an uninterrupted talk, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p> <p>She just stared at him, and he sighed before steering her toward the express elevator to his penthouse apartment.</p><p>\u201cJames, I\u2019ll call you when I need you to take Miss Knight home,\u201d Dante said once he and Cleo were safely aboard the lift. James nodded, his expression serious and businesslike once again.</p><p>\u201cWhat restaurant are we going to?\u201d she asked, her voice alive with doubt, and Dante squeezed his eyes shut before confirming her suspicion.</p><p>\u201cNo restaurant. I brought you to my apartment. We can talk there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go to your apartment,\u201d she screeched, and he grimaced. \u201cLet me off at the next floor. Where are the buttons for the other floors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCleo, come on. Don\u2019t be silly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure, now you use my name, when you have me trapped in this creepy one-button elevator. Is that supposed to reassure me? Are you using my name to create a rapport with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d he asked, trying\u2014and failing\u2014to keep the exasperation out of his voice.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what kidnappers do, right? Try to create a rapport with their victims?\u201d They\u2019d reached the penthouse floor, and Dante shook his head and stepped into the elegant lobby, leaving her to frantically push at the single button in the elevator.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t work,\u201d he told her after her third desperate jab. \u201cIt\u2019s coded to accept only my fingerprint.\u201d</p><p>Of course it was. She was so pissed off. Bringing her to his place was a sneaky thing to do. She would really rather speak to him on neutral ground or on her own territory. And she had a feeling he knew that. This didn\u2019t bode well for future amicable relations. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She glared at him before reluctantly stepping out of the elevator.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t figure out if this is reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter\u2019s lair or James Bond\u2019s high-tech den,\u201d she muttered, and he tossed her a cynical little smile.</p><p>\u201cIs that a retinal scan?\u201d she asked, fascinated in spite herself as he stepped up to a discreet sensor next to the door frame. A green light switched on after the scan, and he followed it up by placing his palm on a panel below the sensor, and a second green light switched on. Just below the panel was a keypad, and he shielded it slightly with his body as he keyed in a number. There was a third green light followed by a slightly musical beep, and he opened his door and waved her in.</p><p>\u201cParanoid much?\u201d she asked as she swept by him.</p> <p>The place was huge, lavish, and seriously expensive, with panoramic views of the mountain, the waterfront, the yacht basin, and the ocean through floor-to-ceiling glass panes. There was gray-and-white marble everywhere, ugly stark furniture, and gigantic potted plants that looked like they belonged in a greenhouse or a rain forest. Then again, with all the glass, this place could easily pass for both greenhouse and goldfish bowl.</p><p>\u201cGuess you don\u2019t roam around naked much,\u201d she observed, stepping up to one of the windows and glancing down at the little people strolling around on the dock.</p><p>\u201cThe windows are tinted,\u201d he said, his gravelly voice sending unwelcome stirrings of desire shuddering up her spine. \u201cWe could do all manner of things in here, and nobody would ever know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you can see out.\u201d Ugh. That didn\u2019t sound sexy so much as creepy.</p><p>\u201cHmm, it tends to bring out the closet exhibitionist in some people,\u201d he murmured.</p> <p>She ignored his suggestive tone and continued to roam around the place, pausing every so often to stare out at the view or to look more closely at some grotesquely oversized vase or to gape in awe at his gigantic flat-screen TV and ridiculously complicated-looking entertainment system.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say a word, just watched as she flitted from one part of the huge living room to the next. She eventually paused at a sliding door that led out to the wooden deck with its deep blue rectangular infinity pool.</p><p>She was aware of his eyes on her as she slipped out onto the deck. The rain had stopped enough for the weak, watery spring sun to slip between the clouds and bless her with a glorious shaft of light. She lifted her face to the heat and just stood there, trying to gird herself for what was to come.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m putting a couple of T-bones on the grill.\u201d Dante\u2019s quiet voice came from behind her and startled her out of her reverie. Immediately back on the defensive, she stepped out of the sun and under the eaves. It was cold in the shadows, which kept her alert and ready for anything he had to throw at her. \u201cHow do you like your steak cooked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMedium,\u201d she said, and hugged her arms around her as she tried to ward off the chill.</p><p>\u201cCome in out of the cold,\u201d he told her as he turned to go back inside, and she followed. Once inside she wandered aimlessly from one end of the living room to the other. He was busy in the open-plan kitchen, his tie undone, jacket tossed aside, and shirtsleeves rolled up. It was the most relaxed she\u2019d ever seen him. His kitchen was a modern masterpiece of chrome and marble, and felt as frigid and unlived in as the rest of his home.</p> <p>That\u2019s what was wrong with this place! It didn\u2019t feel like anyone actually lived here. There were no personal effects lying around, no family pictures, no clothes scattered about. No remnants of any work he\u2019d been doing spread out, not even a book he might have been reading. It was eerie.</p><p>\u201cYou can have a look upstairs if you like,\u201d he invited, and she glanced over at him in surprise.</p><p>There was another floor?</p><p>\u201cThe staircase is tucked away over there.\u201d He nodded toward a spot opposite the patio door, and she saw that the staircase was situated inconspicuously in the far corner of the room.</p><p>She meandered over to it, and before she knew it, she had her hand on the highly polished banister and was making her way upstairs. Like the living area down below, the place was a marvel of d\u00e9cor and architecture and was as cold as ice. Cleo hated it. There were three bedrooms, each with its own attached bath and shower, complete with a king-size bed with matching bureaus, huge walk-in closets, and a wall of those nasty voyeuristic windows. There was also a spacious, very well-equipped gym with a treadmill, Airdyne bike, punching bags of various sizes, and weight-training equipment. Considering his hard body, she figured he probably spent a lot of time blowing off steam in here.</p><p>His study was the smallest room and the only one that bore any hint of personality. It was furnished with rich oak furniture, and gorgeous floor-to-ceiling bookshelves took up an entire wall of the room. It was also the only room with wooden floors, a fireplace, and cozy rugs. Comfy overstuffed chairs and a matching love seat were situated in front of the fireplace. His large oak desk took up an entire corner of the room, which was where she saw real signs of life. Papers, a laptop, a familiar-looking iPad, and . . . was that a ficus perched on his desk? She shuddered at the sight of it and focused instead on several framed photographs.</p><p>The one that held her attention was an old photo of a grinning dark-haired boy of about nine or ten hugging a scruffy dog. Of course, it could only be Dante. The eyes were the same, and the boyish features held a promise of the gorgeousness to come. There was another picture close by of an older man who bore a striking resemblance to Dante, with his arm around the teen version of Dante. A smile twitched at her lips as she took in the gawky frame that would eventually fill out so magnificently, the awkward hunched shoulders, and the glare. The glare was definitely Dante\u2019s. Then there was a picture of Dante and Luc beaming at the camera in their graduation robes, both looking young and carefree as they held up their degrees in triumph. Luc had a similar picture in his study. Cleo had missed Luc\u2019s graduation; she\u2019d been busy doing something she\u2019d undoubtedly considered vastly more important but couldn\u2019t even remember seven years later. She sighed and tore her eyes from the photograph. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There were a few other pictures scattered about of the dog, the older man with various women, and one of a yacht, but no more of Dante. In all there couldn\u2019t have been more than ten photographs, and she found that rather sad. She might have resented her grandparents, but every aspect of her childhood and teen years had been recorded for posterity. Every report card kept, every playbill from every dance recital she\u2019d ever been in had been meticulously filed away in a scrapbook. She had been loved, and it showed in every memento and photograph that they had kept of\u2014and for\u2014her.</p><p>Feeling like an intruder, she backed out of the room and headed downstairs. Dante was focused on whatever he was doing in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIt smells divine,\u201d she said, leaning on the butcher block in the middle of the kitchen as she watched him chop veggies for a salad.</p><p>\u201cI hope it tastes divine,\u201d he said, and shrugged a little awkwardly.</p> <p>\u201cDo you often cook?\u201d She would never have guessed it of him.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed. I enjoy it. I have never really cooked for anyone before now, though.\u201d The confession surprised her, and her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t bring women here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill you stop saying \u2018really\u2019? It\u2019s . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAggravating?\u201d she supplied without thinking.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s . . . ,\u201d he continued, ignoring her.</p><p>\u201cFrustrating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnoying.\u201d The word was gritted out between teeth so tightly clenched, Cleo actually feared he\u2019d break them.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Frustrating\u2019 and \u2018aggravating\u2019 are synonyms for \u2018annoying,\u2019\u201d she pointed out.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to use \u2018annoying.\u2019 Which is what you\u2019re being right now. In addition to being frustrating and aggravating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re being redundant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really difficult to talk to sometimes,\u201d he accused, his accent thickening with every word, and she shrugged a little shamefacedly.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she confessed. \u201cIt\u2019s a defense mechanism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to put you on the defensive, but it seems to be your natural state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my natural state around you.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and pointed to the kitchen cabinet.</p><p>\u201cCutlery, tableware, place mats.\u201d He pointed at the huge dining table a couple of yards away. \u201cTable. Make yourself useful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d she said snappily, and jumped to it.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>\u201cWhoa, this is great,\u201d Cleo enthused, after slicing off a sliver of tender, perfectly cooked steak. It was beautifully flavored and practically melted in her mouth. Dante had served it with a mushroom sauce, a baked potato with all the trimmings, and a healthy green salad. He had a glass of Pinotage to accompany his meal, and she had settled on grape soda\u2014she thought she could pretend it was red wine until she took a sip and the sweet fizziness made a liar out of her.</p><p>\u201cI never imagined you\u2019d be a good cook,\u201d she said as she dug into her potato.</p><p>\u201cI find it relaxing,\u201d he said. He seemed a little uncomfortable with her praise and quickly changed the subject. \u201cBy the way . . . kidnappers do not try to create a rapport with their victims. That would make them terrible kidnappers. Victims try to create the rapport. They want the kidnappers to see them as human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that what you said earlier was technically incorrect,\u201d he pointed out, and she laughed incredulously.</p><p>\u201cI was making a point,\u201d she said, and he shrugged. \u201cYou brought me here against my will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought you here for a reason,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYes, to talk. So talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually wanted you to see this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She didn\u2019t like the sound of that. Why would he bring her to see his home? And why was he now evading her eyes?</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d He sighed. \u201cThis pregnancy has taken us both by surprise, and considering how much you dislike me, I can\u2019t imagine you were too thrilled when you first learned about it. Were you?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated before shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you decided, despite your initial reservations, to keep the baby. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot because I wanted anything from you,\u201d she said, hating her own defensiveness.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t have a financial motive for keeping the baby,\u201d he admitted. \u201cAnd I apologize for initially implying that you did. I\u2019m just curious.\u201d</p><p>Implying? He had out and out accused her of trying to extort money from him.</p><p>\u201cAt first I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to terminate the pregnancy or not,\u201d she said, letting the whole implying thing slide for now. She pushed her half-eaten meal aside, appetite lost. He did the same with his meal, seemingly as disturbed by her confession as she had been to make it.</p><p>\u201cAnd then I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to keep him or not. But then he had fingers and fingernails.\u201d She wiped at her blurry eyes and was surprised to discover moisture there. \u201cI just felt so protective of him after that. And then I started to think of him as my baby. And that was it. I was going to be this baby\u2019s mother. But in order to take proper care of him, I\u2019d need financial support, and that\u2019s why I approached you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you ever have told me about the baby if you\u2019d decided to give him up for adoption?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. There was\u2014is\u2014nothing between us, so it just seemed like it would complicate things even more.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want you to know that I understand everything you\u2019ve done, all the decisions you\u2019ve made up till now, and I want you to recognize that I won\u2019t attempt to take this baby from you.

The baby won\u2019t be here for another six months; that\u2019s time enough to agree on some kind of joint-custody arrangement.\u201d The thought of sharing her baby\u2019s time with him wasn\u2019t at all appealing, but she did acknowledge that he had rights in this situation despite the documents he\u2019d signed. She could only hope that he changed his mind again before she gave birth.</p><p>\u201cThe baby is already here, and I want her to have the best possible care even before her birth,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cI can do it better.\u201d She gasped at that arrogant proclamation, which embodied everything she had feared about his involvement. This was Dante Damaso taking charge and railroading her.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you? I\u2019ve been taking care of myself quite fine up until now, with absolutely zero support from you. One little letter and suddenly you\u2019re ready to play dad? And what if you change your mind again next week? Or next month? Or years down the line? How do I deal with the fallout then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I wasn\u2019t really sure what I\u2019d like my actual role to be, but I do want to be a part of that child\u2019s life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs what?\u201d Frustration made her voice shrill. \u201cHis uncle? A friend of the family? Figure out what you want before you drag my baby into your life, Dante.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I want. All I know is that I would like an opportunity to work it out, and I still have six months within which to do that. In the meantime, you moving in here would help me make that decision while simultaneously solving the immediate predicament you have with your living arrangements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to live with you.\u201d She shook her head, still unable to believe he was suggesting such an outlandish notion. Yet his eyes were deadly serious.</p><p>\u201cYou know how much I travel. I\u2019m hardly ever here, so you\u2019d have the run of the place. You can make yourself at home, have friends over, live comfortably, and I can be sure that you\u2019re safe and well taken care of while you\u2019re pregnant with my kid.\u201d</p><p>It was a completely insane idea. She wasn\u2019t going to allow him to manipulate her like this. Not while she still had options.</p><p>\u201cAnd what happens after the baby\u2019s born?\u201d Her question seemed to stump him, and he ruminated over it for a few moments before replying.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll work something else out. Find a suitable home for you both. I\u2019ll help with that, and if you have reservations about me helping with property, I\u2019ll be more than happy to put it in the baby\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not just do that now?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cBy the time we find the right place and complete all the paperwork, your pregnancy would be too advanced. And where would you live in the meantime? With Blue and Luc? Do you think that\u2019s fair? Being a burden on them like that? Besides, there\u2019s no name to put on the papers yet.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he had all the answers today.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a good idea for me to live here, Dante.\u201d She pushed herself away from the table. \u201cI\u2019d like to leave now, please.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, the muscles bunching in his jaw as he fought to keep whatever emotion he was feeling under wraps. He tossed aside his napkin.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d He helped her shrug into her jacket and then lifted his phone up from one of the kitchen counters.</p><p>\u201cJames, we\u2019ll be down in a couple of minutes. Meet us at the elevator.\u201d He hung up without another word and waved her ahead of him. \u201cAfter you.\u201d</p><p>The sun was just starting to set half an hour later, when Dante walked Cleo up to the security gate of her building. An unsavory-looking young man was hanging out next to the gate. He was smoking something that smelled a little too aromatic to be a cigarette and jerked his chin at them when he saw them approach.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Sup?\u201d he muttered and then looked away from Dante\u2019s intimidating glare.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dante,\u201d she said firmly, hoping to send him back to the car, where James stood waiting. He was having none of that, though, and lifted an unimpressed brow at her words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m walking you to your door,\u201d he said, glancing at the lurking boy with palpable distaste. \u201cFor obvious reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d she protested. \u201cThey\u2019re all mostly students.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, that particular student\u201d\u2014he said with a nod toward the sinister-looking young man\u2014\u201cmust be putting himself through college by dealing dope. And those two over there . . .\u201d This time he nodded toward a giggling, swaying pair of young women in tight miniskirts and thigh-high boots. \u201cAre probably hooking to pay their tuition.\u201d</p><p>Cleo peered at the girls in the gloomy light and gasped when she recognized them. They saw her at the same time and screeched in delight at the sight of her.</p><p>\u201cOMG! Cleo!\u201d Coco screamed, and Cleo caught Dante involuntarily flinching at the sound of that high-pitched voice. \u201cIt\u2019s so weird to find you waiting down here for us. It\u2019s like you knew we were coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did know, remember?\u201d Gigi reminded her in an only slightly less shrill voice. And Cleo hadn\u2019t really known they were coming, since nothing definite had been arranged.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Dante muttered beneath his breath, and Cleo smiled at the consternation she could hear in his voice.</p><p>\u201cHi, girls,\u201d Cleo greeted, and the two scantily clad women fell all over her, showering her with hugs and kisses. Coco, predictably, was the first one to notice Dante.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi there. I\u2019m Coco Sibiya. Nice to meet you. Always happy to meet any friend of Cleo\u2019s.\u201d The staggeringly beautiful ebony-skinned woman grabbed his hand before he could offer it and shook it heartily. \u201cAnd this is Gigi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Petite and pretty blonde Gigi waved shyly but didn\u2019t try to take his hand.</p><p>Dante thrust his hands in his pockets and stared at the three of them thoughtfully. Cleo tried to picture them through his eyes and realized that they were all approximately the same height\u2014just slightly above five feet\u2014with similar body types. Gigi and Coco were a little slimmer than Cleo, since she\u2019d started to pick up some baby weight.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you all know one another?\u201d he asked curiously, momen-tarily diverted from the loitering wannabe thug, who was also watching them curiously.</p><p>\u201cWe went to dance school together. And Cleo and I danced with the same company for a year after we graduated,\u201d Coco explained. \u201cShe always was the most talented and going on to bigger and better things before Cal dropped her.\u201d</p><p>Cleo glared daggers at Coco for wording it like that. Cal still felt immense guilt over what had happened and had tried his damnedest to make it up to her. He\u2019d taken time off from his own career to help her recuperate, and in a way the incident had ruined his career too. Cleo suspected that he was unable to allow himself to succeed.</p><p>\u201cHe dropped you?\u201d There was a dangerous edge in Dante\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cIt was an accident.\u201d It was the first time\u2014since it had happened\u2014that Cleo could hear a ring of absolute truth and sincerity in her own voice. How could she have allowed one of her best friends to wallow in his own guilt for so long? How could she have steeped herself in such absolute self-pity that she\u2019d been blind to what she was doing to him? God, she was an awful person. Shallow, selfish, and weak. She shook her head, slightly dazed by the direction of her thoughts.</p><p>She looked up at Dante, whose eyes were narrowed in concern, and hated the doubt she now felt about him, about how she was dealing with her pregnancy and his need to be involved.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well, his career took a hit after that too,\u201d Coco cheerfully divulged.</p><p>\u201cThis is ancient history, Coco. I\u2019d rather not discuss it any longer,\u201d Cleo said pointedly, and Gigi, bless her soul, jumped right into the awkward breach.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re here to take Cleo out for a night on the town. Would you like to join us, Mr. . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamaso,\u201d he informed her, and held out a hand to Gigi, who shook it with enthusiasm. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure Cleo\u2019s feeling up to a night on the town.\u201d The last was said with a worried look at Cleo, who felt a little punch-drunk after her epiphany.</p><p>\u201cCleo?\u201d Coco waved a hand in front of her dazed eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you, girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . .\u201d Cleo blinked, finally coming back to the present. \u201cI\u2019m a little tired. Not up to a night of partying, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww, come on, don\u2019t be such a spoilsport, it\u2019ll be just like old times.\u201d Coco pouted and Cleo nearly giggled at that. \u201cOld times\u201d had included early bedtimes, brutally long rehearsals, tired minds and bodies, and disgustingly painful feet. The few nights they had gone out to \u201cparty\u201d had nearly always ended after only two or three drinks before midnight had effectively wiped her out. Not exactly halcyon party nights.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little pregnant,\u201d she admitted with a smile, happy at that moment to let that old life go and excited for whatever the future held. \u201cNo drinking for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Gigi\u2019s shriek was impressive and could rival anything Coco had in her bag of screeches. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome. I\u2019ll make a fantastic aunt, Cleo.\u201d She hugged Cleo tightly. Cleo laughed at her enthusiasm. Coco seemed a little shell-shocked but hugged her as well.</p><p>\u201cWow, this is unexpected news,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m making a few lifestyle changes. I have to leave this place, for one. Cleo pointed to the building behind her. \u201cI\u2019ll probably wind up moving in with the baby\u2019s dad.\u201d</p><p>She saw Dante\u2019s head swivel in her direction, and she met his shocked, questioning gaze with a shrug. After everything she\u2019d just learned about herself, she felt that maybe giving him the benefit of the doubt would be the best thing for her baby, for Dante, and for herself. She hoped this was the right course of action. Only time would tell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In the end, Coco and Gigi walked her up to her apartment, and Cleo managed to send Dante on his way after he extracted a promise from her that she would call him later. Cal wasn\u2019t home when the women reached the apartment, which was a blessing\u2014in that he absolutely hated Coco and, to a lesser extent, Gigi\u2014and a curse because Cleo was desperate to talk to him after her revelation. She figured he was probably uncertain of her mood and hiding out after \u201cabandoning\u201d her at the doctor\u2019s office that afternoon.</p><p>Coco and Gigi stayed for a couple of hours, eating forbidden chocolate truffles, chatting about the company\u2019s new production of Cinderella and Coco\u2019s role as one of the evil stepsisters, Cal, the weather, and eventually Dante.</p><p>\u201cSo, that man is gorgeous,\u201d Coco said, licking some melted chocolate off her fingertips.</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d Cleo asked evasively, and both Gigi and Coco threw her a dry look.</p> <p>\u201cDo we have to answer that?\u201d Coco asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine. Yeah, he\u2019s good-looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s the baby\u2019s dad?\u201d Coco prompted. With everything that had happened, was the nondisclosure agreement still valid? Cleo had no idea how things stood between her and Dante now.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my ex-boss,\u201d she hedged. \u201cWe were just going over some details involving my old job. He\u2019s a bit of a prick, actually.\u201d Most of that was technically true.</p><p>\u201cSo, who is the baby\u2019s dad?\u201d Gigi asked, falling for the subterfuge like the sweet, trusting soul she was. Coco\u2019s eyes told Cleo that she wasn\u2019t buying it at all, but thankfully she didn\u2019t pursue the matter.</p> <p>\u201cNobody you\u2019d know,\u201d Cleo said dismissively, before asking Coco another question about her new role. As a diversion, it was pretty effective, because there was nothing Coco loved more than talking about herself.</p><p>Cal wasn\u2019t back by the time they left, so Cleo bit the bullet and called Dante. Luckily she still had his number in her phone. He answered after the second ring.</p><p>\u201cDid you mean it?\u201d he asked without preamble.</p><p>\u201cYes, but there are a few caveats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course there are,\u201d he said drily.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t have my freedom curbed,\u201d she said, ignoring his sarcasm.</p> <p>\u201cHow the hell would I curb your freedom?\u201d He actually sounded offended. \u201cI won\u2019t shackle you to the kitchen sink or whatever the hell it is you\u2019re imagining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just mean that I\u2019ll come and go as I please. I still dance regularly at a studio in Newlands, and I\u2019m thinking of teaching a few classes to earn some money.\u201d She\u2019d been thinking about this option more and more after her last visit to Susan\u2019s studio. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so bad; maybe she could finally let go of her old ambitions and take pride in her students\u2019 achievements. It would help if said students were kids instead of teens or adults, though. She wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d be any good at it, but she was still excited at the thought of a fresh start.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to work,\u201d Dante said.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d There was a long silence after that firm proclamation before she heard him clear his throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMy life is my own, and where I go, what I do, and who I do it with are none of your concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean with men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean in general. But yeah, any relationships\u2014platonic or otherwise\u2014I happen to form with other men are not your business.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou intend to get involved with guys while you\u2019re pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows? Life is weird like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, and the same rule applies to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Like she cared. Okay, maybe she cared. A little. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll be looking for a small\u2014not huge, expensive, or ostentatious\u2014place for the baby and me to move into after he\u2019s born. The place will be in his name. It will never belong to me. Any money from you will go toward my medical bills and the baby\u2019s necessities, like clothes, medical bills, and education.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to set up a trust fund and a university fund.\u201d</p><p>She let him have that one, since the next one was so important to her.</p><p>\u201cThe baby\u2019s last name will be Knight, and while you will play a role in his or her life, you will never be named as this child\u2019s father.\u201d He was silent for so long that she feared they had lost the connection. When his voice eventually broke the silence, it was quiet and a little hoarse.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Cleo exhaled the breath she\u2019d been holding and allowed herself to relax.</p><p>\u201cI want all of that in writing and witnessed by both attorneys before I move in,\u201d she added shakily.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>After another achingly long silence, Cleo felt her eyes well up with tears. She hoped to God this was the right move for all of them. She didn\u2019t want to be unfair, but she didn\u2019t want to screw herself over either.</p><p>\u201cDante,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMi placer, cielo.\u201d The Spanish startled her. Dante\u2019s English was so good that, despite his accent, she sometimes forgot that Spanish was his first language. She was starting to learn that he only ever used it when he was under emotional duress.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll have to tell Luc about this now,\u201d she acknowledged, saddened by how the news would potentially affect her brother.</p><p>\u201cI should do it,\u201d Dante insisted. \u201cIt is the man\u2019s duty, and I should have told him long before now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDante, there\u2019s no need for this sexist BS,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s my brother. I know how to handle him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d She could hear him practically gritting his teeth as he said it, and she sighed, remaining silent to avoid an argument but already planning when and where to tell her brother about the thing with Dante. She just needed to get to Luc before Dante did, which would be easy since Dante was a slave to his schedule.</p><p>He seemed to take her silence for tacit agreement and changed the subject by asking her when she thought she\u2019d be ready to move in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to give notice here, sort out the teaching job with my friend at the studio, and figure out what I\u2019ll be bringing with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me know if you need help; I will arrange movers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do it myself,\u201d she protested, and he sighed loudly.</p><p>\u201cThere you go again, being needlessly difficult. It is a sincere offer of help, dulzura.\u201d She blinked at the endearment. She had Googled it after their return from Tokyo and discovered that it meant \u201csweetness.\u201d This was the first time he had used it outside of an intimate setting, and it took her by surprise.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she whispered, wondering how the hell this was going to work when every single offer he made to help her felt like charity and a blow to her pride. She needed to loosen up a bit.</p><p>They ended the call soon afterward, and after a quick shower, she slipped into a pair of fuzzy pajamas and sent a text message to Cal, asking where he was. It was nearly midnight when he responded.</p> <p>Out with Carl. Be home soon.</p><p>Cleo stared at the screen and wondered who the hell Carl was. Last time she checked, he was dating some guy named Bryan.</p><p>She went to the kitchen and made herself a cup of cocoa, trying not to see the dishes piled in the sink. Dante\u2019s cold marble-and-chrome masterpiece of an apartment wouldn\u2019t remain pristine for long. She wasn\u2019t the neatest of roommates, and she hoped for his sake he\u2019d meant it when he said he wouldn\u2019t be around much.</p><p>She was sitting at the kitchen table when Cal finally breezed in about ten minutes later, and she got up immediately to walk straight into his arms and hug him tightly. His arms closed around her in surprise.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s this? Are you okay, hon? I\u2019m sorry for deserting you at the doctor\u2019s office, but Damaso said he\u2019d get you home and that you guys needed to work some stuff out, which I definitely agreed with. Did he upset you? I\u2019m sorry. I should have foreseen that . . . I should have stayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she murmured into his chest. \u201cYou were right. We had some stuff to work out. I\u2019m not upset about that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen what\u2019s this about? Pregnancy hormones again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCal, we need to talk.\u201d She took his hand and led him to the kitchen table, where he sat down opposite her, his face etched with concern.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to say that I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAbout what? Moving? Hon, we\u2019ve been over this . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor never really forgiving you after the accident.\u201d His mouth snapped shut and his eyes burned into hers. He didn\u2019t say a word, and she reached over to touch one of his clenched fists where it rested on the table. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault, you know. But I needed someone to blame, and all these years I\u2019ve subconsciously blamed you, and worse, I allowed you to blame yourself. Which makes me a crappy friend and an even crappier person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dropped you,\u201d he said quietly, and he turned his hand over to clasp hers.</p><p>\u201cAnd my timing and balance were off,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cYou know that. How we both didn\u2019t get catastrophically injured is beyond me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, I should have held on. I was taller, stronger . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHon,\u201d she said, using his nickname for her, and he smiled through the tears that were starting to glitter in his gray eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re only human. When I lost my balance, you tried your damnedest to hold on to me, but you couldn\u2019t. In all this time I never really admitted that I was also to blame. I\u2019ve been so selfish. I\u2019ve sat back and watched you practically self-destruct, and I never once said anything. I just let you do it. And the worst is, in three years, I never even realized it until tonight. I\u2019ve felt sorry for myself long enough. My dancing career is over, and it has been for years. And my life is fine without dance, and, Cal, as your very best friend who wants nothing but wonderful things for you, I want you to go out there and be everything I no longer can. Your career isn\u2019t over; you\u2019re a damned fine dancer. Stop acting like a complete ass to make me feel better and get your career back on track.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s all this coming from?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be a mother, time for me to start behaving like an adult, don\u2019t you think? I love you, Cal, and I\u2019m going to miss you like crazy once you start working and touring, but let\u2019s face it, we do tend to drive each other crazy all the time anyway.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and just like that, everything felt lighter and better between them. Better than it had been for years.</p><p>\u201cDante, good to see you, man.\u201d Lucius grabbed hold of Dante\u2019s hand and gave him one of those manly half hugs. It was a familiarity that Dante only ever allowed with Lucius; most of his other male friends were a little more tightly wound and a little less likable. After his conversation with Cleo the night before, Dante suspected that she would try to see her brother before he could have the chance to. So he\u2019d canceled his early-morning meetings and come straight to Luc\u2019s office. Dante knew that he risked losing a friendship he valued very much. It was one of the reasons he\u2019d given the clearly unqualified Cleo a job in such a high-ranking position in the first place\u2014he\u2019d felt he owed it to Luc. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to spring this visit on you,\u201d Dante told Luc as the man ushered him into a seat in his dingy little office at the back of the store he managed. Dante glanced around the place. Luc had been brilliant at school, and it was inconceivable to Dante that he wasn\u2019t the business manager of some multi-million-dollar corporation somewhere. He shouldn\u2019t be working in such a tiny store in this industrial part of Cape Town.</p><p>Dante looked at his friend and saw\u2014for the first time\u2014the lines etched into his brow and next to his mouth. He looked older than his thirty-two years, and there was some early gray mixed into his thick black hair. He and Cleo bore a passing resemblance to each other, in the eyes and around the nose and mouth.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, amigo?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cAh, you know, same old same old. Nothing much has changed since we saw you last. Blue and I are still trying to get that wedding organized, but the house is taking up our spare funds at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>Dante had offered, years ago, to help out with the house, but Luc was as stubborn and proud as his sister. He could definitely see where Cleo got it from now.</p><p>\u201cAnd hey, man,\u201d Luc added, \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to apologize about the whole Cleo thing for a while now.\u201d</p><p>It was the opening Dante had been searching for, even though the man\u2019s words baffled him.</p><p>\u201cThe Cleo thing?\u201d Dante wasn\u2019t sure what to make of Luc\u2019s cryptic statement.</p><p>\u201cYeah, first, she didn\u2019t even know who you were when she applied for that job. I mean, I was a little irritated with her for applying, I didn\u2019t want you to think I had anything to do with it.\u201d Dante shook his head in disbelief. Unable to grasp that Cleo\u2019s job application had been sheer coincidence. But then knowing what he knew about both Cleo and Luc, how could it have been anything different? The siblings would rather chew off their own limbs before asking a friend for help. \u201cAnd then to just quit like that?\u201d</p> <p>Luc shook his head in disgust.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s always been so irresponsible, and now with the . . .\u201d He paused, even though Dante knew he\u2019d been about to mention the pregnancy. Luc shook his head again before continuing. \u201cAnyway, I just wanted to apologize about that. Her behavior was completely rash, as usual.\u201d</p><p>Something about the way Luc was denigrating Cleo rubbed Dante the wrong way, especially since it was completely unfair.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be so harsh on her,\u201d Dante said, and Luc did a double take.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be so hard on her. She didn\u2019t quit. I fired her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou did?\u201d Luc\u2019s brow furrowed, as he tried to process this new information. \u201cWhy? What did she do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should give your sister the benefit of the doubt once in a while,\u201d Dante said, and Luc\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cDante,\u201d he said, his voice going dangerously quiet. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is what I\u2019ve come here to discuss with you,\u201d Dante replied, clearing his throat awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cWhat? My sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And the baby.\u201d</p><p>Luc pushed himself up out of his chair and braced his clenched fists on the desk in front of him as he leaned forward to pin Dante with his fierce glare. Dante remained seated, allowing the man the position of power in this instance because, really, Dante was in the wrong.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know about the baby?\u201d Luc asked in an uneven voice, and Dante took a deep breath and met his friend\u2019s gaze head-on before bidding one of his longest-standing friendships a reluctant farewell.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the child\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>Luc moved so fast it took both of them by surprise. Dante was out of his chair and pinned against the thin prefab wall in seconds.</p><p>\u201cYou bastard,\u201d Luc hissed, his hands fisted in Dante\u2019s shirtfront. \u201cI trusted you with my family!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuc, take it easy.\u201d Dante tried to remain calm and nonconfrontational, but Luc dragged him forward and slammed him back against the wall, shaking it violently.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be marrying her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t,\u201d Dante corrected. \u201cNeither your sister nor I want that. I will, however, be taking care of her and of the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need anything from you,\u201d Luc said, the Knight pride once again coming to the surface. \u201cNot one bloody thing. If you won\u2019t do the right thing and marry her, then I\u2019ll take care of her and the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, Lucius. The baby is my responsibility. Cleo\u2014while she\u2019s pregnant\u2014is my responsibility. You have Blue and the house to take care of. Cleo will be moving in with me for the remainder of her pregnancy, and after that she\u2019ll be moving into a house that I will purchase in our child\u2019s name\u2014as per her wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, money buys you out of every undesirable situation, doesn\u2019t it? Must be nice,\u201d Luc said with a sneer, and the man\u2019s contemptuous words stung more than they should have. Dante tried not to let them affect him, but it was hard when Luc\u2019s opinion of him had just hit rock bottom. \u201cMy sister and her child are not for sale. You can take whatever the hell deals you have made with her and shove them up your ass. Get out of my office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe arrangements that Cleo and I have made have nothing to do with you. I only came to tell you about our plans out of respect for you and for our friendship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have so much respect for me that you used my sister like one of your little sluts? And then tossed her aside like rubbish when she turned up pregnant? And worse than that, you fired her? Why? Because your mistake would be staring you in the face every day as she grew bigger and bigger with your little bast\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Dante finally pushed back, releasing Luc\u2019s hold on him and preventing him from saying the horrible word he\u2019d been about to utter. To his credit, the other man looked shamefaced for a few moments, before the anger took over again.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out of my office,\u201d Luc seethed, and Dante, tempted though he was to leave, stood his ground.</p><p>\u201cLuc, Cleo will be moving in with me, and she\u2019s going to need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what the hell my sister needs; I know her better than you do,\u201d Luc retorted.</p> <p>Dante nodded. \u201cJust don\u2019t abandon her because you\u2019re pissed off with me,\u201d he said.</p><p>Luc seemed to consider his words before drawing back and punching him in the jaw.</p><p>Dante reeled, his hand going up to his throbbing face. His instinctive reaction was to punch back, but he knew that he owed Luc a free one and let it go. He opened and closed his jaw to test if it was broken, but luckily it was just stiff.</p><p>\u201cI deserved that,\u201d he acknowledged, and the words seemed to infuriate Luc even more. When the man drew back for another punch, Dante felt the need to warn him, \u201cBut the second one won\u2019t be free.\u201d</p><p>The warning made Luc hesitate.</p> <p>\u201cI hope you will come to understand that I never meant to disrespect you or your family, Luc,\u201d Dante explained. \u201cBut the solution to Cleo\u2019s pregnancy isn\u2019t marriage. We\u2019d both be miserable, and as a consequence, the child would suffer too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear any more of your pathetic excuses, Damaso.\u201d Luc refused to meet his eyes, which bothered Dante more than anything that had happened before. \u201cYou\u2019re not the man I thought you were.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>Cleo\u2014upon arrival at Luc\u2019s work\u2014spotted Dante\u2019s car immediately. She brought her car to a quick stop and jumped out to confront James, who, as usual, was a stoic sentinel beside the gleaming black car.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me he\u2019s in there,\u201d she said, dread pooling in her stomach. James removed his sunglasses and nodded. Cleo muttered something completely unladylike before tossing her keys at James and sprinting toward the entrance of the grubby little IT store her brother managed.</p><p>\u201cJames, I\u2019m sorry, please park that for me,\u201d she called over her shoulder, and because she wasn\u2019t looking where she was going, she ran full tilt into something hard and immovable.</p> <p>\u201cOof!\u201d She stared up at whatever it was she\u2019d just run into and then immediately scowled.</p><p>\u201cGod, are you okay?\u201d Dante\u2019s hands had come up to steady her, and he looked her over for potential damage.</p><p>\u201cYou just had to get here before me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d she hissed, ignoring his concern. She brushed away his hands impatiently. \u201cIs he here? Have you seen him?\u201d</p><p>Dante nodded, the grim set of his jaw and the blankness in his stare telling her everything she needed to know.</p><p>\u201cHow did he take it?\u201d she asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cNot well.\u201d His hand involuntarily moved up to his jaw, and she saw the bruise forming there.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, he hit you?\u201d Her brother was usually such a pacifist. Wouldn\u2019t even harm a fly\u2014well, okay, he\u2019d probably harm a fly, but he wouldn\u2019t harm a small fuzzy animal like a mouse\u2014so for him to up and hit Dante was beyond her imagination.</p><p>\u201cDid you hit him?\u201d she asked suspiciously, and a flicker of annoyance entered Dante\u2019s frighteningly blank eyes, which she much preferred to the shell-shocked expression there previously.</p> <p>\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t hit him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say so, yes.\u201d His dry rejoinder made her attempt to push past his bulk and get into the building, but he kept sidestepping to prevent her from passing him.</p><p>\u201cHey, get out of my way,\u201d she demanded, exasperation peppering her voice.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s extremely pissed off at the moment, Cleo. I think he might say something you\u2019d both regret, and it\u2019ll cause an unnecessary rift.\u201d The words showed more sensitivity than she\u2019d believed him capable of, and she wasn\u2019t sure how to take it.</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t think there\u2019s already a rift now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing that can\u2019t be fixed,\u201d Dante said. \u201cAt the moment all his anger is focused on me. If you walk in there now, it\u2019ll redirect to you . . . don\u2019t do that to yourself or to him.\u201d</p><p>She bit the inside of her cheek as she thought about his words and finally nodded. He took her arm and led her back to where their cars were parked. Or rather, where his car was parked. James was behind the wheel of her car, trying to slot it into the space next to Dante\u2019s sedan. The huge man looked ridiculous behind the wheel of her small hatchback, and they both paused to stare before Cleo sniggered, then chuckled, then burst into loud, uncontrollable laughter. Dante halted in midstride to stare at her, and the alarmed expression on his face made her laugh harder. Soon her laughter took on a desperate, hysterical edge, and before she knew it, tears were seeping from her eyes and slipping down her cheeks, and the howls became tearing sobs. Dante said something beneath his breath and dragged her into his arms and held her tenderly as she hunched into him and allowed herself to cry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered after the worst of the storm had abated, and he murmured gently in response, smoothing her hair back from her face and using his handkerchief to dab at her hot and swollen cheeks.</p><p>\u201cCome on, you need some rest,\u201d he said authoritatively, and she nodded, heading toward her car, but his hand on her elbow stopped her. \u201cNot what I meant. You\u2019re definitely not driving in this condition, and I for damned sure don\u2019t think you\u2019d get any rest in that apartment of yours. James will be following in your car, and I will be driving us to my place.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She opened her mouth to protest, but he placed a long finger on her lips to silence her. The skin-on-skin contact was so unexpected that Cleo found herself momentarily diverted. It was long enough for him to hastily bundle her into the passenger seat of his luxury car and climb in next to her.</p><p>\u201cDante, I don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCleo, try to be cooperative for once in your life, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s almost on par with me asking you to not be bossy for once in your life,\u201d she pointed out, and he grinned. An honest-to-God grin. She could get used to seeing that. It was such an open and boyish expression that it was quite breathtaking to witness.</p> <p>\u201cWe each have our weaknesses,\u201d he quipped.</p><p>\u201cStop smiling like that, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d she admonished. \u201cPeople might start mistaking you for a nice guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod forbid,\u201d he retorted, and she stared at him, wondering if there was a sense of humor hidden beneath that detached fa\u00e7ade he presented to the world.</p><p>The drive back to his place was short and silent, and when he parked his car, she made one last halfhearted protest.</p><p>\u201cJames could drive me back to my place,\u201d she suggested. \u201cI promise to rest when I get home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re already here. You might as well enjoy the quiet and take a nap. I\u2019ll be heading back to the office, so you\u2019ll have the place to yourself. Help yourself to anything, and if you need something, contact James. He\u2019ll see to it.\u201d</p><p>Cleo figured it was a good trial run for when she moved in and decided not to argue any further. She was genuinely tired. The emotional outburst of that morning, combined with the overall lethargy she still felt, resulted in a powerful urge to just sleep.</p><p>Dante escorted her back into his penthouse, going through all those high-tech security procedures before they found themselves facing each other in the middle of his living room. He dug a pen out of his breast pocket and scribbled a four-digit number on the edge of a discarded newspaper on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cThis is the code for the elevator, should you decide to go home later.\u201d He took hold of her hand and held it palm up before dropping her car keys in it. \u201cIf you choose to leave, please let James know that you\u2019re going. I\u2019ve left him with explicit instructions to ensure you get home safely.\u201d She didn\u2019t say anything to that, even though she was doing some serious mental eye-rolling. She\u2019d been getting herself home safely for years now, but this was Dante\u2019s paranoid world, and while she was in it, she supposed she\u2019d have to adhere to the weirdness.</p><p>He was standing so close to her that she could feel his torso brush against her chest with every inhalation of breath. He lifted his hand and oh-so-tenderly brushed her hair back from her face. His fingertips grasped one tendril, and an enigmatic smile played about his perfect lips.</p><p>\u201cLove the blue,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI prefer it to the pink. Pink\u2019s not your color.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was thinking of going p-purple next,\u201d she heard herself saying inanely, and he looked at the strand he held captive in his fingertips for one long, evaluating moment.</p><p>\u201cIt might clash with your eyes a bit. The purple would have to be subtle,\u201d he announced, and she nodded, wondering why they were standing here discussing her hair. He seemed to snap out of whatever spell he was under and blinked a couple of times before shaking his head and dropping her hair.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I . . . uh . . . I should get back to work. Try to rest, dulzura,\u201d he said, his voice soft. \u201cIt\u2019ll do both of you the world of good.\u201d</p><p>The word both reminded Cleo that the main reason she was here and that he even wanted her close was because of the baby. He\u2019d kicked her out of his life before they\u2019d known about this pregnancy, and the baby was the only reason she was back. She\u2019d better not lose sight of that fact, and she had damned well better not start weaving dangerous fantasies around this man. Especially now that she was starting to see other\u2014likable\u2014aspects of his personality.</p><p>She watched him leave and waited for a few moments before she trudged up to one of the spare rooms. She kicked off her shoes on her way up the stairs and shrugged out of her denim jacket. By the time she fell into the closest bed, she was wearing nothing but a tank top and a pair of boy shorts. She dragged a comforter up to cover her body and was asleep in seconds.</p><p>Cleo\u2019s wreck of a car was still parked in the underground garage when Dante returned home that evening. He had\u2014uncharacteristically\u2014finished work at the stroke of five, leaving a lot of speculative glances and raised eyebrows in his wake. He had ignored everybody\u2019s blatant curiosity and rushed to get home. According to James, Cleo hadn\u2019t yet left, and Dante wanted to assure himself that she was okay. Considering her stubborn nature, he would have expected her to leave hours ago. The fact that she was still here was a little concerning.</p><p>He let himself in, and a quick glance around the lower level of his apartment told him that it was empty and quiet as a tomb. He could feel his heart start up a heavy bass beat in his chest as panic began to edge its way into his consciousness. He didn\u2019t know what the hell he was expecting to find, but he wasn\u2019t sure it would be good.</p><p>He headed up the stairs and told himself that he was being ridiculous, even while his breath caught in his throat. He was so focused on reaching the top of the single flight of stairs that he didn\u2019t see the shoe on the step in front of him and tripped over it. He glanced down incredulously and picked up the small white sneaker, feeling a little perplexed by its presence there. The shoe\u2019s twin lay two steps up. And a denim jacket was carelessly thrown over the banister just above the second shoe.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He picked up the items as he went along, feeling like someone following a particularly naughty trail of bread crumbs . . . denim skirt, T-shirt, and even a bra were scattered on the staircase and landing, and Dante found himself wondering if this was an attempt to seduce him.</p><p>A rueful glance down at his straining erection told him that if it was an attempt, it was wholly successful so far. He reluctantly acknowledged that the thought of a half-naked Cleo in one of those huge beds was more than enough to make his dick stand up and go \u201cYes, please.\u201d There he stood\u2014making an incongruous picture\u2014with an armload of decadently Cleo-scented clothes, rampant and ready for her. He glimpsed a tiny sock discarded outside the middle door and followed it blindly, knowing that Cleo was probably behind that door.</p><p>Naked and as primed for him as he was for her.</p><p>Hopefully.</p><p>He tossed her clothes aside and stumbled toward the door, opening it without knocking and without further thought. The sight that met his eyes stopped him dead in his tracks. She lay in the middle of the huge bed, curled up in a tight ball, fast asleep. He could see that she had attempted to drag the comforter up over herself, but the thing had slid half off the bed and only covered her slender thighs. She was wearing a pair of those damned boy shorts he so loved\u2014Daisy Duck again\u2014and a white tank top. She must have dragged the bra out from beneath the tank. She had one hand tucked beneath her cheek and the other curled over her abdomen in an unconsciously protective gesture; her knees were tucked and drawn up almost to her chest. For such a tiny thing in such a huge bed, she took up a surprising amount of space.</p><p>Asleep she presented a picture of innocence, yet that didn\u2019t dampen his desire for her one bit. Thank God she was sleeping, or Dante might have made a huge mistake. Bringing sex into this confusing situation would complicate things exponentially. He would have to ignore these baser urges, especially if she was moving in here.</p><p>He walked over to the bed, unable to take his eyes off her. Completely relaxed like this, without that challenging look in her eyes and the combative tilt of her jaw, she was goddamned beautiful. The revelation stunned him. He had never really seen this beauty before and couldn\u2019t be sure why he was seeing it now. She still had those same odd features that in no way seemed to go together. Most of the time she could probably be described as pretty in an offbeat way, but at that moment, she was nothing short of breathtaking.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to think about that, didn\u2019t want to evaluate this change of heart, and instead dragged the comforter back over her and tucked her in securely before turning and walking out of the room.</p><p>When Cleo woke up, she was completely disoriented and panicked. Where was she? A glance around didn\u2019t help matters when she saw not one familiar item anywhere. She took a deep breath and tried to remember what had happened before she\u2019d fallen asleep. When she recalled where she was, she groped around for her phone, which was tucked beneath the pillow, to check the time. It was just after eight in the evening, and she\u2019d slept for nearly nine hours.</p><p>There were half a dozen missed calls on her phone from Blue and not a single one from Luc. She sat up quickly and speed-dialed Blue\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cCleo? Thank God!\u201d Her friend\u2019s voice throbbed with relief, and Cleo felt guilty for making her worry. \u201cWhere are you? And what\u2019s going on? Luc isn\u2019t making any sense. He slammed his way into his study and refuses to talk to me about whatever it is that\u2019s bugging him. All I know is that you\u2019re somehow involved.\u201d</p><p>That was unusual behavior for Luc, who always told Blue everything. Cleo tried not to think about what it could possibly mean if he refused to even talk to Blue about this.</p><p>\u201cDante Damaso went to speak with Luc this morning,\u201d Cleo said quietly, her voice thick after nine hours of disuse.</p><p>\u201cDante Damaso? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my baby\u2019s father. He told Luc that I\u2019d be living with him until the baby\u2019s born.\u201d Blue was completely silent at the other end of the line. \u201cBlue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Blue moaned. \u201cCleo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel horrible. I know what good friends they are . . . were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could still come and stay with us. You don\u2019t have to live with him,\u201d Blue said.</p><p>\u201cI know that, but he is this baby\u2019s father, and I think this is the best move for everyone. Most especially for my baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuc will come around, Cleo,\u201d Blue told her.</p><p>\u201cI ruined their friendship, Blue,\u201d Cleo said, tears running down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll work out,\u201d Blue said, always the optimist. \u201cHe\u2019s going to need time, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at Dante\u2019s right now, but I won\u2019t be moving in for another couple of weeks yet. Do you think I should come and talk to Luc before then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me talk to him and try to get him over the worst of it,\u201d Blue suggested. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you updated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCleo are you . . . do you . . .\u201d Blue framed hesitantly. \u201cDo you have feelings for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Cleo ignored her annoying internal voice, which had been silent for so long, as it called her a heinous liar.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just something that happened.\u201d Cleo felt the need to explain the inexplicable, mostly for her own benefit. \u201cIn Tokyo. A thing. He was there, I was there. It happened. We used protection, but how does that quote from Jurassic Park go? \u2018Life will find a way.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Blue giggled, and Cleo could hear the tears in the bubbly sound. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOnly you would compare the conception of your baby with dinosaurs procreating in a fictitious park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a badass saying, you have to admit it,\u201d Cleo said with her own wet little giggle.</p><p>They chatted for a while longer before Cleo reluctantly dis-connected the call and thought about heading downstairs and back home. The place was eerily quiet, and she wasn\u2019t sure if Dante had returned yet. She knew the crazy hours he worked, and with the current project in Tokyo and a new one starting up in Dubai, she doubted he\u2019d be home before midnight these days.</p><p>She glanced around the room for her clothes before remembering that she\u2019d discarded them on her way up the stairs. Jeez, she\u2019d really have to curb these messy tendencies of hers if she was going to live in this squeaky-clean place. Something on the dresser caught her eye, and upon closer inspection, she saw that it was her clothes, immaculately folded and neatly placed on the dresser\u2019s smooth wooden surface.</p> <p>Someone had been in here while she was sleeping! The thought gave her the heebie-jeebies. Did Dante have a maid? Could it have been James? She doubted that. Could it have been Dante himself?</p><p>She pulled on her clothes and tentatively made her way down the stairs. The lights were on, music played softly on the high-tech sound system, and when she walked around the kitchen to the living room, she found Dante sprawled out on the uncomfortable-looking couch. He was wearing faded jeans and a gray T-shirt, and his sneakers had been toed off. Cleo had never seen him dressed like that before. Three-piece suits and nude, that was all she knew of Dante Damaso. This was a completely different man slumped in front of her right now. He had one long leg on the couch and the other bent at the knee, with his foot on the marble floor. His head was resting on the hard, small arm of a couch that just wasn\u2019t designed for relaxation. A sheaf of papers was spread on his broad chest, pinned down securely with one hand, and his glasses were perched on his nose and dangerously close to falling off. His mouth was ever-so-slightly open, and he was snoring quietly.</p><p>Dante Damaso was a handsome man, an outstanding specimen of manhood that other men envied and most women desired, but Cleo had never found him more irresistible than at that moment. He looked young, vulnerable, and completely disheveled, and Cleo felt like she was only really seeing him now for the first time.</p><p>She felt confused and desperate to leave before he noticed her. But she wasn\u2019t even halfway to the door before she heard him sigh and the papers on his chest crinkle as he moved.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asked, his voice husky with sleep, and Cleo\u2019s back straightened as she shot him a guilty look over her shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cI was heading home. I didn\u2019t mean to sleep for so long.\u201d She turned to face him and swallowed when he sat up and stretched, his T-shirt tightening over his chest and abs. He had stubble growing in, and he briskly rubbed his hand over his jaw as if the hair growth bothered him.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d he invited. \u201cHave some dinner. I cooked pasta. There\u2019s some in the microwave for you.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly charmed by the fact that he\u2019d gone to the trouble to make a plate for her, she hesitated, and he offered her a sleepy smile.</p><p>\u201cI would prefer it if you stayed over,\u201d he said. \u201cSafer than driving this time of night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s eight thirty,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cHardly midnight. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll manage to get home without much trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay.\u201d He stood up and walked toward her, and even in his socks he towered above her. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p> <p>Okay, so she was a sucker, but it was the \u201cPlease\u201d that did it. She nodded and dropped her bag in the middle of the floor before heading for the kitchen.</p><p>Sure enough, there was a foil-covered plate in the microwave for her. She removed the foil and set the timer to a minute and a half.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s freshly baked bread in the tin and a salad in the fridge,\u201d Dante advised, as he sat down at the island to watch her flit about the kitchen. He seemed content just to watch her and didn\u2019t have much to say.</p><p>She set her plate and utensils down on the island beside him before fetching her salad and bread and sitting down next to him to enjoy her meal. She ate ravenously. As was usually the case these days, once the nausea disappeared, she found herself eating like a horse, and Dante watched her pack it away in fascination.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a hell of a lot of food for such a little thing,\u201d he observed after a long silence, and Cleo peered at him before shrugging.</p><p>\u201cEating for two,\u201d she reminded him past a mouthful of bread, and he grinned. She could get used to him grinning like this all the time.</p><p>\u201cSo you were a professional dancer?\u201d She sighed. Small talk. How . . . inevitable.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d she said, mopping up some of the delicious tomato sauce on her plate with a chunk of soft, fresh bread and stuffing it into her mouth. \u201cThis is delicious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made the bread too?\u201d She didn\u2019t care if she sounded like a Neanderthal, talking with her mouth full; this was a divine meal.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened when Cal dropped you?\u201d he asked, and she glared at him, wishing he hadn\u2019t asked that question. Good thing she\u2019d nearly finished her meal, since her appetite had completely disappeared.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to go through these little getting-to-know-you rituals, Dante,\u201d she dismissed coldly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t think less of you for not really knowing anything about me. That\u2019s not why I\u2019m here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, picking up her plate and utensils and carrying them to the sink. She watched him tidy up and shook her head at how completely different they were. \u201cSo, I\u2019m an only child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Why did he feel the need to tell her that?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an only child,\u201d he repeated patiently. \u201cMy mother died of leukemia when I was five and a half. My father remarried soon after that. And then he divorced and remarried again. And so on and so forth. I\u2019ve lost count of how many there were. And he\u2019s getting remarried to a woman about a decade younger than me in a couple of weeks\u2019 time. He always falls head over heels in love, marries without protecting himself or his assets, and then is surprised when he gets taken to the cleaners a year or two later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d she asked, horrified and fascinated by the story he was telling her, but not at all sure why he would choose to divulge this to her, now or ever.</p> <p>\u201cYou might not want me to know about you, but I think it\u2019s time you learned something about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? That makes no sense,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said enigmatically. \u201cAnyway, my father is an idiot when it comes to matters of the heart, and I have decided never to be like him.\u201d</p><p>Was he warning her off? Trying to tell her that he would always protect himself and his assets? She already knew that about him. So this warning was moot.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she nodded. \u201cWell, you can take great comfort in the fact that you\u2019re not like him at all. You with your nondisclosure agreements and your bloodless little relationships, or whatever you call them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm.\u201d That was his only response. \u201cYou\u2019re probably not sleepy at all. Want to watch a movie or something?\u201d Trying very hard not to think about what that \u201cor something\u201d could entail, Cleo firmly opted for the movie.</p><p>\u201cI have a lot to choose from,\u201d he informed her, following her into the living room. He picked up a tablet from the table and showed her how his system worked. \u201cThey\u2019re all digital copies, and if there\u2019s anything on here I don\u2019t have or you would like to see, you can purchase them here.\u201d</p><p>Once she had a rudimentary knowledge of how the system worked, he left her to flick through the movie choices while he went back to his work. Cleo curled up in a hard, angular, horrifically uncomfortable chair and settled back to watch.</p><p>A few bloodcurdling screams later, Dante looked up, his face pale and focused on the gigantic screen.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you watching?\u201d he asked hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the latest horror films,\u201d she said, naming the movie, which had been a surprise hit the previous year. \u201cSsh. I\u2019m trying to watch.\u201d</p> <p>His brow pleated as he continued to stare at the screen, and after a while, he was leaning forward, his elbows resting on his thighs as he focused on the screen.</p><p>\u201cWhy would they play that ridiculous game in a new house?\u201d he asked, shaking his head but never once removing his eyes from the screen.</p><p>\u201cHave you never seen this movie before?\u201d Cleo asked in surprise, and he shook his head, keeping his eyes glued on the television.</p><p>\u201cA lot of the new movies are automatic purchases, but I never have the time to watch. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve even heard of this movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard of it, and apparently it\u2019s pretty scary,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a movie,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cWe know that it\u2019s fiction. How scary can it possibly be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one is based on fact,\u201d she informed him in a spooky voice, and he shot her a fleeting glance before refocusing on the screen.</p><p>\u201cYeah, probably really loosely based,\u201d he retorted skeptically, and Cleo rolled her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cShush and let me watch. Go back to work or whatever it is you\u2019re doing,\u201d she demanded. His lips quirked and he dropped his eyes back to his documents, but Cleo was watching him surreptitiously and noticed him glancing back up at the screen seconds later. After a while he sat back and put his feet up on the coffee table. One major jump scare later, he was swearing prolifically and on the edge of his seat again.</p><p>Cleo was so busy watching him that she could barely focus on the movie. He was obviously freaked out but trying manfully not to show it, yet he jumped slightly with every scare. It was cute to watch the macho, unflappable Dante Damaso losing his cool over a scary movie.</p><p>By the end of the film, Cleo barely knew what it had been about, while Dante\u2019s face was grim and a little pale.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can watch crap like that,\u201d he grumbled, and she grinned.</p><p>\u201cYou seemed to be enjoying it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just . . .\u201d He paused as he considered his next words. \u201cScientifically curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDante you were so scared you practically peed yourself every time something creepy happened,\u201d she pointed out gleefully, and he looked so affronted that she burst into laughter. The next thing she knew he was kneeling in front of her chair and capturing her mouth with his, swallowing her remaining laughter in a kiss so scorching and intense it set her nerve endings on fire.</p><p>When he finally lifted his mouth, it was to give her a languid smile.</p><p>\u201cStop laughing at me,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve stopped,\u201d she responded shakily.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He kissed her again, this time he added his hands into the mix, and before she knew it, he had dragged her back onto the couch with him and she was straddling his lap.</p><p>\u201cThis is a terrible idea,\u201d she protested. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s the best idea I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDante, we can\u2019t resume a sexual relationship; it\u2019ll complicate things.\u201d She sounded unconvincing, even to herself. Especially since her hands were roaming beneath his T-shirt and reacquainting themselves with his gorgeous chest and abdomen.</p><p>\u201cHow about we finally finish the one we started in Tokyo? We\u2019ve never gotten that out of our systems. We ended it before it ran its course.\u201d Each sentence was punctuated with a long, drugging kiss, while his hands went to town beneath her tank top. She hadn\u2019t bothered to put her bra back on, since her breasts were starting to feel swollen and painful and her bras were all getting too tight and confining. When his fingers flicked one of her nipples, she hissed and arched her back violently.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d he asked worriedly, his hands retreating slightly.</p><p>\u201cSensitive,\u201d she muttered. \u201cVery, very sensitive. Treat them with care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d he said, and dragged her tank up to drop a reverent kiss on the hard little nub. He followed it up with a lick and then some quick, extremely tender suctioning.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Cleo\u2019s hands tangled in his thick hair, and his mouth left her so that he could peer up at her over the peaks of her small breasts.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re bigger than I remember,\u201d he said, his tone sounded bemused and a little reverent. \u201cAnd the nipples are darker. Still so damned pretty.\u201d</p><p>He flipped her over until she was sitting on the couch and moved down to kiss her abdomen tenderly, right above the spot where she knew their baby rested. The gesture was so sweet and loving that it took her breath away. Dante might not have known what role he wanted to play in this baby\u2019s life yet, but he was clearly starting to fall in love with it despite himself.</p><p>He moved even lower until he was under her short denim skirt, and he peeked up at her with a grin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to see my friend Daisy is back,\u201d he said as he placed his hands on her hips and dragged her down slightly. Shortly after that, \u201cDaisy\u201d was slowly slipped down over her thighs, then knees, before he removed her completely. He took one of her slender thighs and rested it on his broad shoulder before\u2014with one last wicked grin at her\u2014he bent down to taste her.</p><p>Cleo cried out at the touch of his mouth and tongue on her most sensitive flesh, and it didn\u2019t take more than a few strokes before she was lost. She was floating back down and was aware of him rearranging her until he was flat on his back on the marble floor and she was straddled above him.</p><p>\u201cIs it okay if we do this?\u201d he asked, the tip of him poised at her entrance. \u201cFor the baby. Is it okay for the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said dazedly. This was happening so quickly. Too quickly. His face was tense as he focused on where their bodies were on the verge of joining. Cleo swallowed. Now that her orgasm had passed and she could think clearly again, her previous doubts came swamping back.</p><p>\u201cDante,\u201d she said, her voice filled with regret as she shifted off him. He looked at her intently before raising an arm to cover his face and sighing deeply.</p><p>\u201cBad idea, huh?\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She glanced at him and winced at the sight of his angry-looking erection. \u201cYou know it\u2019s not a good idea. It just all happened so fast.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his mouth tight beneath the arm that covered his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need some . . . time,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI think I should go home,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he said sharply, and she jumped. He made an effort to soften his voice before speaking again, shifting his arm to glance at her quickly. \u201cNo. Go on upstairs. I just need to get myself under control, and having you right here, where I can still smell and taste your orgasm, is a little difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, but please just . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d She leaped to her feet and vacated the area as quickly as she could. She scurried up the stairs and slammed into the room she\u2019d already picked as her own. Once there, she crawled to the center of the massive bed, drew her legs up, and buried her face in her knees. How the hell were they going to make this work if they couldn\u2019t keep their hands off each other?</p><p>She only hoped that once she started to show, he would lose interest in her body, even though she could barely look at the man without wanting to spontaneously combust. She had seriously mixed feelings about what had just happened between them and wished she hadn\u2019t allowed it. Especially since the evening had ended with him still hard and wanting. Was this another example of Cleopatra Knight being selfish? At this point she had no clue.</p><p>She officially moved in two weeks later, bringing only her clothes, some books, wall art, and her bed. It was a sad testament to her nearly twenty-eight years that she had absolutely nothing more than that to show for herself.</p><p>Cleo and Dante hadn\u2019t interacted much since that last evening together at his place. They had exchanged telephone conversations, and he had e-mailed her snippets from articles he had read about pregnancy and what she should eat and what vitamins she should be taking. It was endearing and a little disconcerting, the level of interest he took in her pregnancy.</p><p>She, in turn, had reciprocated with week-fourteen (which they both already knew) and week-fifteen updates.</p><p>She was in regular contact with Blue, but Luc still wasn\u2019t talking to her or Dante, and it broke her heart. She had tried calling him on several occasions, but he never answered and didn\u2019t respond to a single one of her text messages. Blue told Cleo that he needed time. Cleo gave him his space, but it was difficult not having him around to talk to. She couldn\u2019t remember a single time in her life when her brother hadn\u2019t been there for her, and this was so much harder without his support. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cal was doing well. Since their talk, he\u2019d made a real effort to find decent work. He\u2019d auditioned to be part of the corps de ballet for a small dance company based in Durban, and they had called him just that morning to inform him that he\u2019d gotten the job. He would be staying for the remainder of Cleo\u2019s lease and leaving two weeks after she moved out. Cleo was happy for him, but she would miss him like crazy, especially since her relationship with Luc was so strained.</p><p>Cleo\u2019s own life was looking up too. She\u2019d started helping Susan out with a few classes\u2014kids between the ages of ten and twelve\u2014and she loved it. More than she ever expected. Susan even offered to let her do the choreography for one of their upcoming recitals and was willing to let her do even more classes if the recital went well.</p><p>Cleo\u2019s love for dance was rekindling, but in a different way. She was thinking more and more about the technical aspects of it, how a dancer\u2019s body moved, how she could achieve certain shapes with those bodies through her choreography. It felt fantastic.</p><p>And as far as her pregnancy went, she was developing a tiny bump, which was even more exciting than her new part-time job. Once, she even thought she felt a little wriggle in there, but she\u2019d been mistaken. She couldn\u2019t wait for the baby to start moving.</p> <p>Now she stood in her new room in Dante\u2019s penthouse and took in the changes he\u2019d made to accommodate her. Of course, the trendy king-size bed was gone and had been replaced by her four-poster bed, which would have looked out of place in the room had he held on to the old furniture. But whomever it was he employed to do these things had matched bed stands, bureau, and dresser with the warm teak of her bed, and the room looked so much more inviting. Vertical bamboo blinds, which made it feel more private, now covered the windows.</p><p>Dante was standing in the doorway as she took in her new surroundings, and when she looked back at him, she was surprised to see a flash of nerves on that handsome face. He disguised it pretty quickly, but that brief glimmer had been enough for Cleo to recognize that he was actually unsure of her reaction to the room.</p><p>\u201cI like this room a lot better now,\u201d she said with a smile, and could see the tension around his eyes easing, even though there was no perceptible change in his expression.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he said. \u201cI have something else to show you. Follow me.\u201d</p><p>Curious, she trailed him out of the room and into his gym. He stood aside and waved her in, and she passed him tentatively, wondering what he could possibly have to show her in here. When she looked around the room and noticed what was different, her eyes immediately flooded with irrational, stupid tears.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God, Dante,\u201d she cried, her hands going to her mouth in shock. \u201cThis is too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he asked, striving to sound casual.</p><p>\u201cHow can I not?\u201d Her voice wobbled dangerously, and she inhaled deeply as she walked toward the sprung floor that simply hadn\u2019t been there just two weeks before. He had cleared out a whole corner of his gym for the floor, covered the wall with mirrored panels, and installed a ballet barre to run parallel with the floor.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not as big as the space you\u2019re used to, but I was hoping it would suffice. And of course I consulted a professional dancer\u2014Callum, actually\u2014about the type of floor that would be best. I wasn\u2019t sure . . .\u201d She turned around and shut him up with a fierce hug and an equally intense kiss. The kiss was short-lived, and she stood back to stare into his stunned eyes through a haze of tears.</p><p>\u201cNobody has ever done anything like this for me before,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d At a loss for words, he settled for a shrug. Cleo kicked off her shoes and stepped onto the floor. She took hold of the barre and did a quick and easy series of demi-pli\u00e9s.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to give it a go,\u201d she said over her shoulder, while he stared at her with a completely unreadable expression.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he said tightly. \u201cI have to get back to the office. I\u2019ve squandered enough of my day. James will remain to run your biometrics through the security system. He\u2019ll explain how it all works.\u201d</p><p>He left without so much as a backward glance.</p><p>Stung, Cleo reminded herself to never lose sight of the fact that he was Dante Damaso, and despite any unexpected kindnesses he might throw her way, he wasn\u2019t a very nice man. She was here only because of the baby in her belly, and she\u2019d better not forget that. While there might be some residual desire between them, it would be dangerous to confuse that with anything more meaningful.</p><p>Her hand came to rest on the small bump of her baby, and all her joy in the room fled. She stepped off the floor and, barefoot, went in search of James.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>Two weeks later, Cleo was sitting on the horrendous couch with a huge comfy pillow shoved behind her back and her feet propped up on the coffee table. She had a bowl of warm, buttery popcorn on the stand next to the couch and was watching one of her all-time favorite movies with the intensity of someone seeing it for the first time.</p><p>Dante had been pretty much absent since she\u2019d moved in. He left before she got up in the mornings and came home way after her bedtime. And because he was such a neat freak, he even had a maid come in to clean up his nonexistent mess every other day, so there was never any trace of him around the place. It was like living with a ghost.</p> <p>Cleo, who was so used to Cal being up in her business and Luc constantly calling, felt lonely. She still had her friends from the dance studio and had befriended a few of the mothers of the girls she taught, but at the end of the day, she came home alone to this tomblike place. She wasn\u2019t unhappy, but she felt increasingly isolated. She didn\u2019t have to worry about money or work or her apartment falling apart around her ears\u2014which was a relief\u2014but she had no one to talk to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Blue called her regularly, but Cleo tried to keep her sense of isolation from her friend because she didn\u2019t want Blue to feel torn between her concern for Cleo and her love for Luc.</p><p>Cleo was spending most days at the studio now, and Susan had entrusted her with two back-to-back classes in the afternoons after school hours and with choreographing the ten- to twelve-year-old group\u2019s upcoming recital performance. It was exciting and challenging, and she had so many ideas. Of course she had to consider her students\u2019 abilities, and once she had everything ironed out, they would start rehearsing the dance. She couldn\u2019t imagine anything more exciting than to see her idea come to life onstage. It felt like she had two babies due, and both of them were bringing joy, excitement, and fulfillment into her life.</p><p>Most evenings were spent working out for an hour or so at the barre Dante had installed for her\u2014since she didn\u2019t have time to do so at Susan\u2019s studio anymore\u2014working on the routine, and then eating some dinner and settling down to watch a movie. Tonight, after a long bath in the massive tub in her room, she had donned shorty pajamas and a pair of striped knee socks before getting comfy in front of the TV. She was so focused on the movie that she didn\u2019t even notice the front door swing open and wasn\u2019t aware of Dante\u2019s presence until he spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you watching?\u201d he asked from almost directly behind her, and she nearly jumped out of her skin.</p> <p>\u201cCrap,\u201d she squeaked, lifting a hand to her chest. \u201cYou scared the stuffing out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuffing?\u201d He raised an eyebrow at her language, and she wrinkled her nose.</p><p>\u201cI read somewhere that the baby can hear my voice. I don\u2019t want him to pick up any bad language before he\u2019s even born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can hear us?\u201d Dante looked completely disconcerted by that bit of news, and after shrugging out of his jacket and neatly placing it on the chair, he sat down on the couch next to her. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Shocked the shi\u2014sherbet out of me too.\u201d</p> <p>He grinned, the expression so infectious she found herself grinning back.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think you\u2019ll be able to keep that up?\u201d he asked, his voice wobbling with laughter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m going to try my damnedest not to . . .\u201d She paused, frowned, and then her shoulders sank as she grasped what she\u2019d said. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I thought,\u201d he chuckled, toeing off his shiny shoes and propping his feet up on the table next to hers. Of course his legs were a lot longer, so they were bent at the knees while hers were straight. She got a funny little flutter in her stomach at the sight of his long, slender feet next to her much smaller ones. How could a man\u2019s feet be sexy?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m exhausted,\u201d he confessed, his shoulders slumped and his voice weary. \u201cTokyo hit another snag, and Dubai just can\u2019t seem to get off the ground. I spent the entire week bogged down in meetings.\u201d</p><p>Without seeming to think about it, he turned sideways, dropping his feet over the arm of the couch and\u2014shockingly\u2014his head into her lap. He tugged at his tie and unbuttoned the top two buttons in an effort to get more comfortable and then turned to face the TV.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are we watching?\u201d</p><p>The \u201cwe\u201d undid her, and she allowed the tension to leave her body at this unexpected turn of events. Her hands, which had been hovering in midair as she tried to figure out where to place them, dropped\u2014one to his hair and the other to his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cUh . . .\u201d She stared blankly at the screen as the high-resolution space marines argued among themselves. \u201cAliens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know that one,\u201d he muttered, his voice sounding slurred. \u201cWhat was that thing she said? \u2018Stay away from her, bitch\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhilistine,\u201d she said with a long-suffering sigh, her hand starting to run soothingly through his hair. \u201cYou got that quote all wrong.\u201d</p><p>He twisted his head to meet her eyes with his smiling gaze.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed? What is it then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see. Now be quiet and watch.\u201d</p> <p>Half an hour later, after pilfering half of her popcorn, criticizing a few of the choices some of the characters had made, and wondering why they didn\u2019t just leave someone on the \u201cbig ship\u201d to wait for everybody, his big body went completely limp. A quick glance down confirmed that he\u2019d fallen asleep. Cleo smiled, feeling an overwhelming surge of affection for him. She had never expected to like Dante Damaso, and yet she did. He had wormed his way into her good graces, and she wasn\u2019t exactly sure how.</p><p>The logical part of her brain told her to keep him at a distance, that feeling anything more than fondness for him would lead to pain and possible heartbreak. He wasn\u2019t the type of man one could play house with. He was like a wild animal who seemed to do better without any sentimental emotion bogging him down. Cleo and this baby were momentary blips in his lifestyle, and maybe it was the novelty of the situation that drew him. She couldn\u2019t allow herself to depend on him. Not in any emotional sense. He would keep his word when it came to supporting the child, but if she thought he could feel anything deeper than what he\u2019d promised already, she would be fooling only herself.</p><p>But it was so hard to remember all of that when he was sprawled out on her lap like this.</p><p>She continued to run her hand through his thick, soft hair. He had a dense growth of stubble on his jaw, and she tentatively ran her palm over it, loving the burn of it on her skin. She was so riveted by the feel of him under her hand that at first the fluttering in her abdomen went unnoticed. But when it came again, she recognized that it wasn\u2019t just a tummy rumble or the popcorn unsettling her stomach. A third, faint movement had her gasping and sitting up straighter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her movement woke Dante, who looked at her in alarm.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, instantly alert. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the baby\u2019s moving,\u201d she whispered, keeping her voice low as if she were afraid a loud noise would scare the baby and stop the movement.</p><p>\u201cHe is? You\u2019re sure?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes! Oh God, there he goes again.\u201d Dante sat up and stared at the small bump fixedly. Cleo blindly reached for his hand and placed it where she\u2019d felt the movement. His hand was so large that it just about covered the entire expanse of her stomach. \u201cOh. Did you feel that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head, looking frustrated.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very faint.

She moved her hand, and he was just about to remove his when the gentle flutter returned. This time he felt it, and his eyes shot up to meet hers.</p><p>\u201cChrist!\u201d he gasped.</p><p>\u201cLanguage, Dante,\u201d she warned, tears in her eyes and excitement in her voice. \u201cThere\u2019s a kid in the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he whispered, before leaning down until his mouth was within an inch of her stomach. \u201cSorry, peque\u00f1o, don\u2019t you listen to your daddy\u2019s bad language, okay?\u201d</p><p>Almost simultaneously, they both comprehended that he\u2019d used the word daddy, and Dante froze, his eyes leaping up to meet hers. Cleo wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. What did it mean, him naming himself father to the child? How active did he now expect his role in this child\u2019s life to be?</p> <p>\u201cHow does it feel?\u201d he asked, changing the subject but keeping his hand firmly anchored on her stomach. \u201cTo have him move around like that? Does it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt feels strange. A little bit like indigestion. Not painful or anything, just like a tiny tummy rumble. I wasn\u2019t even sure what it was at first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d he said, his tone brimming with awe and discovery. He stared down at her stomach again, obviously hoping the baby would move some more.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s done for the night,\u201d she said gently, and his eyes shadowed with disappointment.</p><p>\u201cThank you for sharing this with me, dulzura,\u201d he said as he reluctantly lifted his hand from her abdomen. She smiled and refocused on the movie that had been running unheeded while they had marveled over the miraculous life they\u2019d created together.</p><p>He once again lifted his feet to the coffee table and folded his arms over his chest, keeping contact between them limited to occasional accidental brushes.</p><p>\u201cSo do you enjoy the teaching?\u201d he asked about ten minutes later, as they were watching Ripley battle her way through droves of ugly aliens.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m finding it quite rewarding,\u201d she replied. \u201cThe kids are enthusiastic and talented. They remind me a little of myself at that age. I was absolutely obsessed with dancing. I couldn\u2019t wait for school to finish every day so that I could get to dance classes, I spent all of my time practicing my cha\u00een\u00e9s tournes in the mirror, and I wouldn\u2019t stop until my grandmother forced me to do my chores. I resented her so much for that.\u201d</p> <p>She could hear the sadness in her voice at that admission, and from the change in his body language, she knew that Dante could too.</p><p>\u201cThey only wanted what was best for Luc and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never knew our dad. Luc has a slight recollection of him, but he never talks about the man. Our mother left us at our grandparents\u2019 house\u2014the huge old place that Luc\u2019s staying in\u2014when we were five and ten. Told us it was for a holiday and never came back. I heard my grandmother arguing with her on the phone soon after she left us there, and for years afterward I believed that our mom didn\u2019t come back because my gran had chased her away.\u201d</p><p>Dante was silent as she sat there, her hand idly stroking the gentle curve of her abdomen.</p><p>\u201cOf course, now I know that if she\u2019d wanted us back, no force on earth would have been strong enough to keep her away. But I spent my entire childhood and teens resenting my grandmother for a telephone conversation that I could only hear one side of. So stupid.\u201d</p><p>She shook herself and peered up at Dante in embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. You didn\u2019t want to hear all of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary . . . I found it quite insightful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d she asked, and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet. Did you ever hear from your mother again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not a single Christmas or birthday card. No phone calls or letters or e-mails. Nothing until we received word of her death just months after our grandparents passed. She died in Nepal, and the cost of the trip put Luc in a financial hole so deep that he\u2019s still struggling to get out of it more than eight years later. That\u2019s when I really hated her . . . all those years of misdirected anger aimed at my grandparents, who were only trying to provide a stable home life for us. They paid for ballet lessons that they could barely afford and scraped together their money to buy Luc that beaten-up old hatchback for his eighteenth birthday that I now drive. By the time I\u2019d recognized how much they\u2019d sacrificed to raise us, it was too late; they were sick and dying, and then they were gone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Dante\u2019s husky voice jolted her back into the present, and she pressed the heels of her hands into her eyes, embarrassed to find them wet.</p><p>\u201cAargh, I should be over this by now. I just wish I had a second chance with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey sound like the type of people who wouldn\u2019t have wanted you to live with all this guilt; they worked too hard to make you happy. You dishonor them by remembering them with only regret in your heart.\u201d His pragmatic words made her pause and consider. He was right; her grandparents had only wanted Cleo and Luc to be happy. And they\u2019d had some good times too. Maybe she should start remembering those?</p><p>\u201cMy granddad insisted I learn how to ride a bike,\u201d she recalled with a smile. \u201cI argued, at six years old, that a dancer didn\u2019t need to know how to ride a stupid bicycle. And he insisted that everybody needed to know how to ride a bicycle. That man spent days running up and down the road with me, catching me whenever I fell. He never once dropped me.\u201d</p> <p>She stared blindly at the screen in front of her, and they were quiet for the remainder of the movie.</p><p>\u201cI loved them very much,\u201d she said when the credits were running.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he replied and reached over to take one of her hands. He gave it a gentle squeeze before dropping it back into her lap.</p><p>And in that moment, Cleo knew that her feelings for Dante Damaso had definitely evolved into something very complicated. She wasn\u2019t able to put a name or definition on them, wasn\u2019t sure what\u2014if anything\u2014they would grow into, but one thing she was sure of was that she didn\u2019t like where they seemed to be leading. She felt much too vulnerable.</p><p>When Cleo made her way to the gym the following Saturday morning, she heard heavy breathing, grunts, and solid punches. Sure enough, Dante was positioned at one of his heavy punching bags. He was wearing protective gloves, but he was bare chested and barefoot as he punched and kicked the crap out of the bag. It was very primal and masculine and intense. He paused when he saw her standing at the door dressed in her toe shoes, a black leotard, pink leggings, and a wispy pink wrap skirt. He pushed one gloved hand into his already messy hair to get it out of his eyes\u2014he definitely could do with a haircut\u2014and kept his gaze trained on her as she made her way to her dance corner. He looked a little intimidating, gleaming with sweat, and his heaving breaths and rippling muscles and the way he was staring at her, like a lion eyeing a gazelle, didn\u2019t help matters much.</p> <p>She hesitated, not sure if she should wait until after he was done with his workout, but he waved her in, and it was too late to turn around.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she greeted, and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d his greeting was curt, and he went back to thumping his bag aggressively seconds later.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then,\u201d she murmured to herself as she put her music on. The peaceful strains of Chopin\u2019s Nocturnes flooded through the room, so quiet and gentle at first that Dante didn\u2019t seem to notice it above all the vigorous grunting and punching he was doing. Satisfied that she wasn\u2019t disturbing his workout, she settled into her stretches and then started her barre work. She was moving on to her en pointe exercises when she became aware of the silence at the other end of the room. She looked up into the mirror and saw that he had stopped his workout completely and was watching her again, riveted. She was in the middle of an arabesque pench\u00e9, supported by her left leg, with her right leg lifted and extended straight behind her. It was a classical ballet pose and did an amazing job of strengthening her core and working on every single muscle in her calves and thighs. She slowly sank back into first position, and he raised his eyes to meet hers in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cThat was beautiful,\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>\u201cSo was what you were doing.\u201d And it was, in an extremely raw and primitive way.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well, it didn\u2019t quite match this music.\u201d His broad shoulders moved restlessly and drew her attention back to his beautifully proportioned, well-muscled body.</p><p>\u201cThe Ballerina and the Beast,\u201d he said gruffly, as if reading her thoughts. \u201cYou make that look so effortless. It\u2019s hard to believe that you\u2019re no longer able to dance professionally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, believe it,\u201d she said, turning around to face him properly. \u201cThe way I fell? I\u2019m lucky I didn\u2019t break my neck. Broke my leg in two places, injured my hip, and my knee.\u201d She shook her head, the memory sending a shudder down her spine even all these years later. That awful feeling of inevitability of being unable to stop yourself as the worst happened.</p><p>\u201cI would have been able to fully recover from any one of those injuries quite easily,\u201d she said, unconsciously sweeping her right foot back and forth. \u201cBut all of them combined were catastrophic, and the knee is simply unable to bear the strain of a professional dancer\u2019s life anymore. I\u2019d had injuries before, countless injuries, and I knew when I landed that it was the end of my career, but it took me years to accept it. Anyway . . . I was wondering how long you\u2019ve been doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kickboxing?\u201d She nodded, and he rolled his shoulders before peeling off his gloves. \u201cSince I was an early teen. I had some . . . anger-management issues. My father thought I needed to channel some of that rage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d she prompted, but he just nodded and went back to punching his bag, ending the conversation. A little irritated that she had told him so much about herself while receiving next to nothing in return, Cleo went back to her own workout, vowing to keep her own counsel in the future. Just because she was lonely and a chatty person didn\u2019t mean Dante was the best person to blab to about her sorry life story. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He finished before she did and left the gym without another word. She watched him leave in the mirror; he didn\u2019t spare so much as a backward glance.</p><p>She had no idea what was going on in his mind most of the time, and once again questioned her decision to come and live here. Despite the improved surroundings and financial circumstances, she was filled with as much doubt as ever and constantly worried about the future.</p><p>She finished her workout and headed to her room for a shower. When she emerged a short while later, it was to find him sitting on the deck with a mug of coffee in hand. He was staring at the yachts, deep in thought. She grabbed a glass of juice and hesitated at the sliding door leading out to the deck, not sure if she should join him or not. Maybe he wanted some privacy; she didn\u2019t know him well enough yet to tell.</p><p>She decided to play it safe and turned away from the door to wander into the living room instead. On the way, she grabbed a discarded newspaper from one of the kitchen counters and sank down onto the floor next to the low coffee table. She went straight to the crossword puzzle and picked up his expensive Montblanc pen, which was lying on the table next to his glasses. She was immersed in the puzzle within minutes.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you on the floor?\u201d Dante\u2019s voice brought her back into the present, and she gazed back at him blankly. He stood, hands in his trouser pockets, staring down at her with a curious look on his face.</p><p>\u201cYour couch is uncomfortable,\u201d she said, before going back to nibbling the end of his pen and giving the puzzle her rapt attention.</p><p>\u201cMore uncomfortable than the floor?\u201d</p><p>Irritated by the interruption, she clicked her tongue and glowered at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to concentrate,\u201d she snapped, and his eyebrows shot up before he unceremoniously plonked himself down next to her.</p> <p>\u201cTry \u2018place,\u2019\u201d he suggested, pointing to the paper.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen down. It\u2019s \u2018place,\u2019\u201d he said with a smug smile. She peered at the paper and sighed.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d she said, before neatly penning the letters V E N U E into the blocks. His lips twisted, and he refocused his attention on her puzzle before grunting.</p><p>\u201cTwelve across is . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d she commanded, placing her hand over the puzzle in an effort to block his view. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m helping you,\u201d he replied, looking a little perplexed by her reaction.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need help finishing my puzzle,\u201d she fumed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my newspaper,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s my puzzle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce a newspaper has been read and then tossed aside, it becomes public property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cI have never heard of this rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s the rule in South Africa. I can\u2019t help it if you had different rules in Spain. I have an entire nation behind me on this one. Now back off and let me finish my puzzle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile I\u2019m down here, I might as well help you out,\u201d he said magnanimously.</p><p>\u201cEnglish isn\u2019t even your first language,\u201d she rebuffed.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not nice,\u201d he chastised. \u201cI don\u2019t make fun of your shortcomings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I have none.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talk too much,\u201d he pointed out, and she gasped, rather outraged by that. \u201cYou have this annoying habit of finishing my sentences, and you have an odd sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have no sense of humor,\u201d she dismissed breezily. \u201cJeez, would it kill you to laugh once in a while? You really need to find a surgeon to remove that stick you have up your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you call a fly without wings?\u201d he interrupted, and she blinked. He was staring at her expectantly, eyebrows up and lips tilted at the corners.</p><p>\u201cUh . . . what?\u201d she asked, needing some clarification.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you call a fly without wings?\u201d he repeated, his voice laden with anticipation and something she couldn\u2019t quite define.</p><p>\u201cA walk?\u201d The light dimmed in his eyes, and the smile that had been forming on his lips faded. She was actually sorry she had given him the right answer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard it before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDante . . . everybody over the age of five has heard that joke before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard it in passing at work yesterday. See? I have a sense of humor, but clearly it\u2019s much too sophisticated for someone like you to possibly comprehend,\u201d he said gravely, and she gaped at him, not sure if he was serious or not. He thought the fly joke was sophisticated? Was he joking? But his face was expressionless, and she couldn\u2019t quite tell what was going on in that diabolical mind of his.</p><p>\u201cSomeone like me?\u201d She latched onto that bit, and when he opened his mouth to clarify what he\u2019d meant, she held up her palm to stop him. \u201cNo, wait, don\u2019t tell me. I\u2019ve heard this before. Something about you not appreciating celebrity gossip or wanting to hear about what\u2019s trending on Twitter. Or the Kardashians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you carry on about them so much while you were working for me? There are also Klingons, Vulcans, and . . . why are you laughing?\u201d The last as Cleo literally rolled on the floor and laughed her ass off. She actually had to clutch her sides because it was the kind of belly laughter that just couldn\u2019t be contained. When the laughter died, she felt completely spent and gradually came to realize that she was lying flat on her back, staring up at a smiling Dante. How could he smile at her like that one moment and be completely remote the next? His eyes were warm and inviting, and that smile was open and tender. He reached over and brushed a thumb over her cheeks. They came away wet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you laugh like that before,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had much to laugh about,\u201d she pointed out softly. She remained on her back, one arm curled up above her head and the other resting on the mound of their baby. \u201cAn unwanted sex thing followed by an unwanted pregnancy. Not exactly giggle-worthy topics of conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby can hear you,\u201d he warned, his tone serious. \u201cDon\u2019t let him come into this world thinking he\u2019s unwanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never do that,\u201d she said. \u201cNot after knowing what that kind of rejection feels like. He\u2019s going to know that his mother wants him and loves him.\u201d</p> <p>But not his father, Dante reflected. Because that particular idiot gave him up without a second thought.</p><p>He was having a hard time with this entire situation. Living with her and seeing the child grow inside of her. Feeling that child move. How the hell was he supposed to feel about this baby, knowing that it would never bear his name and never know him as a father? Every single decision he\u2019d made since she\u2019d informed him about her pregnancy had been wrong, and he was paying a harsh price for that stupidity.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t allow himself to develop strong feelings for this baby, not when he would never be able to show those feelings.</p><p>And Cleo . . .</p><p>What the hell was he supposed to do about Cleo? He told himself he\u2019d stay away from her, but then when he came home from work he\u2019d find her watching a movie or reading a book, and he\u2019d find a way to insert himself into that activity. He\u2019d ask her questions even while telling himself he didn\u2019t want to know the answers. And that morning, in the gym, God\u2014how did she get more and more beautiful every time he saw her? How was that even possible?</p> <p>And then there was the other night when he\u2019d allowed himself to get too close. She\u2019d been so right in calling a halt to those proceedings. He barely recognized himself anymore. He was usually much better disciplined than this. He wasn\u2019t a man easily swayed by his emotions. He would get this under control.</p><p>He had to.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you know so much about Star Trek?\u201d she asked curiously, on the verge of falling asleep on the tiled floor. He glanced down into her sleepy face and had a hard time not smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhy does anyone?\u201d he shrugged. \u201cWhy do you know so much about some celebrity family?\u201d</p><p>Ah, so he knew exactly who she\u2019d been talking about, which meant that he must have made that comment to make her laugh.</p><p>So, who the hell was this guy?</p> <p>Before now she would have bet her life on the fact that Dante Damaso did not have a sense of humor. Yet it was there\u2014subtle, dry, and shockingly self-deprecating.</p><p>\u201cSo you did know to whom I was referring?\u201d She grinned.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t back when I told you to find a replacement assistant for me. I looked it up.\u201d He flushed at the confession.</p><p>\u201cSo the comment about the Klingons and the Vulcans just now was . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I have a sense of humor,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cLike I said, you\u2019re always finding all kinds of weird shit to laugh about, but you\u2019re relentlessly grim or sarcastic with me. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be able to make you laugh as openly as you do with other people.\u201d</p><p>What did that mean? That he had wanted her to laugh with him? That was so . . .</p><p>\u201cSweet.\u201d She completed the thought out loud and he looked startled.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou wanted to make me laugh. That was sweet of you, Dante. Don\u2019t deny it.\u201d The last was said when he opened his mouth to comment. Her quick command made him shut his mouth again. \u201cYou wanted to make me laugh. Admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you really are quite obnoxious sometimes,\u201d he groused, without heat. \u201cFine. I wanted to make you laugh. I wanted to prove that I could. Like I said, you\u2019re always laughing with every random person you meet but . . .\u201d His voice tapered off.</p><p>But not with him. Cleo completed the unfinished sentence. Sure, they\u2019d had a few amicable moments together, and she\u2019d shared smiles with him, but this was the first time she\u2019d ever really laughed with him. She\u2019d put up some major defensive barriers to keep him from hurting her, but she couldn\u2019t really remember the last time he had deliberately said or done anything designed to hurt her. Still, just because he hadn\u2019t, didn\u2019t mean he wouldn\u2019t, so her shields would stay up, even though they were taking some battering beneath this weird charm offensive he occasionally launched at her.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to laze around on the floor all day, or are you going to let me help you finish this crossword puzzle?\u201d</p><p>She sighed and unselfconsciously held out a hand for him to tug her back into a sitting position, which he did with the utmost tenderness.</p><p>\u201cFine, but I\u2019m doing this under protest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuly noted.\u201d</p><p>They were halfway through the puzzle when she noticed him staring at her. She lifted a self-conscious hand to her hair, wondering if it was sticking up or something.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she prompted, and he hesitated for a moment, his mouth opening and then closing. \u201cCome on, Dante. Spit it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d The words were hurried and a little garbled but unmistakable. She raised an eyebrow and noticed that he had trouble meeting her eyes.</p><p>\u201cFor which item on your long list of indiscretions?\u201d she asked as she toyed with the pen.</p><p>\u201cAll of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.

You believe me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Cleo . . . I\u2019m really sorry. It was a shitty thing to do, and I\u2019ve regretted it ever since.\u201d</p><p>She thought about it, savoring the moment a little longer.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one has been struck off the list.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait a second. How long is this list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt varies. Items get added and removed all the time. Now can we finish this puzzle, please?\u201d The rest of the morning and part of the afternoon was spent on the floor together, amicably arguing over every single answer. Cleo couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d enjoyed herself more.</p><p>Cleo and Dante got along much better after that day. They no longer seemed like strangers forced to live together and felt more at ease around each other. They fell into an easy routine; Dante cooked when he was home, and Cleo ordered takeout for them when he called to let her know he\u2019d be working late, which happened on average about twice a week. And for some reason, Dante always called to let her know that he\u2019d be back late.</p><p>Their workouts were almost always done together, usually in the mornings before Dante headed off to work, but as Cleo\u2019s pregnancy progressed, her physical routine became less strenuous, and her en pointe exercises nonexistent. On Saturday mornings, they did the crossword puzzle together even though Dante was dismal at it, and they often watched old action or horror movies together. Dante wasn\u2019t the biggest horror-movie fan, and that\u2019s all she ever chose when it was her turn to pick a film, mostly because she loved watching him freak out.</p><p>The next couple of weeks passed quickly and peacefully. But the main source of grief and discontent for Cleo\u2014and she sensed for Dante too\u2014was the fact that Luc still didn\u2019t want to speak to either of them. It was going on longer than any of them had anticipated, and Blue was at her wit\u2019s end. Cleo had actually gone to see Luc at the house and at his office on several occasions. He\u2019d asked her how she was, how the pregnancy was going and\u2014at the house\u2014had found a reason to exit the room and leave her with Blue. At work he\u2019d told her he was too busy to chat. She didn\u2019t know what else to do and decided to let him figure it out in his own time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even watching,\u201d Dante complained, his voice interrupting her thoughts, and she squinted at him before switching her attention back to the television.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s your fault for choosing this boring movie,\u201d she retorted, waving a hand at the screen. It was some generic action movie; she didn\u2019t even think she knew the title. It was badly acted and kind of bland.</p><p>\u201cAre you thinking about tomorrow?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre you nervous?\u201d</p> <p>The dance recital was the following evening, and Cleo didn\u2019t feel the kids were anywhere close to ready. She thought her choreography was lame, and she just knew that something catastrophic would happen. The building nerves and anxiety were pretty much on par with what she used to feel before performing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she said, more to convince herself than him. \u201cThe kids seem confident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s bothering you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLuc.\u201d The name was out before she could prevent it, and he sighed heavily.</p><p>\u201cI had no idea he could be so stubborn,\u201d he said with a wry twist of his lips. \u201cWhy is he so set against the idea of us living together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he knows . . .\u201d Her voice tapered off.</p><p>\u201cKnows what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows that there\u2019s no love between us, and he wanted better than that for me.\u201d Except that she wasn\u2019t so sure the \u201cno love\u201d thing was strictly true anymore. There seemed to be quite a lot of love between them.</p><p>All one-sided and all from her.</p><p>The heavy silence strained the atmosphere, and she kept her eyes glued blindly to the TV even though she could feel his gaze boring into her profile.</p><p>\u201cWe could . . .\u201d This time it was his voice that faded away in the middle of a sentence. He reached for the touch-screen controller and paused the movie, turning his body toward her and waiting until she, reluctantly, did the same. He picked up one of her hands in both of his and turned it over so that he was tracing the lines of her palm with his forefinger. \u201cI think we should consider getting married.\u201d</p><p>She gasped and snatched her hand back as if it had been burned.</p><p>\u201cHear me out,\u201d he said calmly, and she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d She got off the couch and folded her arms across her chest. He got up as well.</p><p>\u201cJust listen,\u201d he said, and tried to reach for her again, but she sidestepped him.</p><p>\u201cWhat a manipulative bastard you are,\u201d she marveled. \u201cYou\u2019ve decided that you want this baby, and you think that offering me marriage will help you get him. You still have such a low opinion of women in general that you probably genuinely believe that this is the brass ring for me, don\u2019t you? What woman wouldn\u2019t want to marry Dante Damaso? After all, you\u2019re loaded and handsome, and that\u2019s what all women want, right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI just figured it would make Luc happy and fix the gap between the two of you,\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cHow goddamn selfless of you, relinquishing your precious freedom on behalf of my relationship with my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say it was selfless.\u201d Frustration started to creep into his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about your relationship with Luc. It\u2019s also about mine. And aside from that, you\u2019re right, I do want this baby. I want to be his dad. I want him to have my name, I want him to know who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t have your name,\u201d she whispered, her voice thick with loathing. \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve to give him your name.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d He finally lost his cool, and his voice rose as his temper broke. \u201cWhat did I do that was so fucking wrong? I made a mistake in the beginning, I reacted in the wrong way, and I\u2019ll be paying for that for the rest of my life. And worse, the baby will be paying for it too, won\u2019t he? Because you\u2019re too stubborn to admit that maybe I\u2019d be a good father to that child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a pretty lousy husband to me,\u201d she added resentfully. \u201cI deserve more than a man who doesn\u2019t love me and who only married me because I was pregnant. We all deserve more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you want me to tell you I love you? Would that make it all better?\u201d he asked, his voice steeped in bitterness and sarcasm. She uttered a hoarse cry as his words broke something inside of her. It made her want to hurt him as much as he had just hurt her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a miserable excuse of a man, Dante,\u201d she said, venom dripping from every word. \u201cAnd if you came crawling to me on broken glass, professing to love me, I would never believe you . . . because you\u2019re incapable of feeling anything remotely close to love.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched and he went pale before he shoved his hands into his pockets and allowed the tension to leave his shoulders until he was almost slouching.</p> <p>\u201cI take it that\u2019s a no to the marriage proposal, then?\u201d he asked with a smirk.</p><p>She gasped and whirled on her heel before heading up to her room as fast as she could. She slammed the door behind her and took childish satisfaction when the sound reverberated through his cold and uninviting apartment. She was shaking uncontrollably and didn\u2019t know how to stop it.</p><p>This is what happened when you allowed yourself to have feelings for someone like Dante Damaso\u2014they found the most creative ways to hurt you, and God, this hurt. She told herself that he hadn\u2019t meant to inflict pain; in his mind it was a cold, businesslike proposition, supposedly beneficial to them both. He expected her to view it in the same dis-passionate way he probably did\u2014marriage to him meant wealth and status for her. It meant she and the baby got the protection of his name and that he got to see if he was capable of being a halfway decent parent to a child.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know that she had fallen in love with him. Why would he? It wasn\u2019t like he had given her any reason to love him, aside from his unexpected moments of sweetness, charm, latent humor, and charisma. But then he turned around and showed her the callous, calculating, and cynical side of him with what had to be the most cold-blooded, jaded proposal in history.</p><p>And how did she tell the idiot that she couldn\u2019t marry him because she loved him? Living as his wife, as the mother of his child, and not having his love would be soul-destroying. She didn\u2019t know what to do, or whom to turn to, and in the end she dragged out her phone and scrolled for Cal\u2019s number. She looked at his name on her screen for a long time before she changed her mind and tossed the phone aside.</p><p>She curled up in the middle of the bed and dragged her knees up to her chest, curving her body protectively around the mound of her baby. She couldn\u2019t leave this apartment, not with Luc still angry with her. She had nowhere else to go.</p> <p>She would hold Dante to his promises, she would allow him to be a presence in the child\u2019s life, but she wasn\u2019t going to marry him, and the baby would not have his name. That was what they\u2019d agreed upon, and that was what the latest\u2014in the increasingly useless\u2014lot of legal documents said. And this was a document she would fight tooth and nail to enforce.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing the right thing, Baby,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut it has to be better than subjecting all three of us to a loveless marriage, right?\u201d</p><p>She was gratified when the baby kicked, and took it as a sign of agreement.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>The following evening, Cleo stood backstage in a tiny school gymnasium and felt her chest swell with pride as her young dancers took their bows and curtsies. They\u2019d been magnificent, and she just wanted to hug every single one of her little stars.</p><p>She gave each one a high five as they trotted offstage and passed her on their way to the changing room. Every child got a word of encouragement and praise, and she couldn\u2019t resist giving the last\u2014tiniest\u2014girl a brief hug.</p><p>\u201cDid you see me, miss?\u201d the little girl asked in excitement, her face flushed and happy.</p><p>\u201cI did. You were absolutely marvelous,\u201d Cleo said but then added, because she was still the teacher here, \u201cbut you have to work on your basic turns, Maisie. We\u2019ll talk about it on Monday, okay? You were fantastic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, miss. Thank you, miss,\u201d the girl said with a grin before prancing off, her pink tutu bouncing as she moved. Cleo watched her go with a fond smile on her face, but the smile faded when she saw the man standing in the doorway Maisie had just disappeared through. Why did he always have to show up where he wasn\u2019t expected or invited? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He watched the girl go before turning back to her with a quizzical look on his face.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever wear those ridiculous little skirts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did, I was a ballet dancer,\u201d she replied before getting straight down to it. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to watch the performance. The kids were great. Your choreography was fantastic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have to go and talk to the children,\u201d she said. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting out in the reception area,\u201d he informed her, and stepped aside to let her pass.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother, I drove myself here and I can drive myself back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting,\u201d he reiterated. Her back stiffened, and she walked off without another look back.</p><p>It took her nearly an hour to finish up. After heaping praise on the kids, she was stopped by parents who were keen to discuss their children. She was supposed to help Susan clean up after the rest of the recital was finished, but the woman, who\u2019d come backstage to congratulate her after her group had danced, urged her to go home, overriding Cleo\u2019s protestations by reminding her that pregnant women should take it easy. Unable to argue with that logic, Cleo had conceded her point and grabbed her denim jacket, heading out of the gym, where the fourteen-year-olds were currently performing.</p> <p>She had her keys in hand and her head down when she walked out of the building, but she was very aware of the fact that Dante and James were standing in the parking lot watching her come down the school steps. They were waiting by her car, so there was no way to avoid them.</p><p>She sighed\u2014knowing it would be useless to argue\u2014and handed her keys to James and waited for Dante to lead her to wherever his car was parked. All without saying a word. She just didn\u2019t feel like arguing, not when they were all going to the same place anyway. Dante didn\u2019t have much to say either, but he threw glances at her every few minutes, which she pointedly ignored.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not used to such silence from you,\u201d he finally said when they were about five minutes from home.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have much to say at the moment,\u201d she said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cThat bad, huh?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what the hell that meant, but it just rubbed her the wrong way, and she turned to him with a ferocious scowl. \u201cYou think being flippant is the way forward here?\u201d she snarled. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve got news for you, buddy\u2014\u201d</p> <p>The ear-splitting sound of screeching brakes interrupted her in midsentence, and she looked up into the driver\u2019s-side window to see a car barreling straight at them.</p><p>\u201cDante!\u201d Her scream was sharp and short-lived, and mere seconds passed between impact and the cessation of all movement and sound.</p><p>She battled her way out from beneath the airbag, which had deployed with a startling pop and had knocked the breath out of her. She could hear Dante groaning and was desperate to get to him. She could see blood and started to panic. His head was bleeding and his eyes were shut, and he sounded like he was in pain.</p><p>\u201cDante?\u201d she whispered. \u201cOh God, Dante! Are you okay? Can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Her door was wrenched open, and she looked up to see James\u2014who\u2019d been following in her car\u2014towering above her, his face grim. He reached down to unbuckle her seat belt.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked, his voice harsh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. See to Dante first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that he\u2019d want me to help you first, Cleo.\u201d James\u2019s voice brooked no argument, and Cleo knew that disagreeing with him would only delay the time it took for him to get to Dante, so she allowed him to unbuckle her and help her out.</p> <p>He ran expert hands over her, his touch telling her that he knew exactly what he was doing and what he was looking for. She batted his hands away impatiently.</p><p>\u201cHelp Dante,\u201d she commanded, and he nodded curtly before heading back to the car. They had been pushed off the road, she noticed dazedly. They were hit while crossing a T-junction, and the other car had pushed them into a field. The second car had come to a standstill a few yards away, and Cleo could see the driver staggering his way out of the car. She stood frozen, her hands to her face in horror, and her entire body went numb as shock started to set in. She turned away from the other driver and back to their car, willing James to hurry, to bring Dante out to safety. And then she heard it\u2014the unmistakable sound of Dante\u2019s impatient voice\u2014and the relief made her legs weak. She sat down in the middle of the field as her body started shaking from head to toe.</p><p>Cleo could hear them quite clearly: James saying that he didn\u2019t think it was wise for Dante to move, and Dante telling him to get the hell out of his way. Dante, being Dante, predictably got his way, and after pushing his way past James, he stood looking like a wild man, his head whipping back and forth as he looked for something. Her, as it turned out.</p><p>\u201cCleo!\u201d The harsh, commanding voice had a desperate edge to it as he called for her, clearly panicking because he couldn\u2019t see her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she called, sounding shockingly weak. His head snapped in her direction, and she saw him wince at the fast movement before he lurched toward her.</p><p>\u201cAh, Jesus,\u201d he cursed when he sank down to his knees in front of her. His hands cupped her face and tilted it up to peer at her closely. \u201cYou\u2019re okay. You\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>He sounded unsteady, and he released her face to gather her tenderly into his arms and hug her close.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered into her hair. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t have happened. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe came out of nowhere,\u201d she protested, her voice wobbling even more than Dante\u2019s. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault. You\u2019re bleeding, Dante.\u201d</p><p>The quiver in her voice gave way to a sob, and he held her even closer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay, nena. Don\u2019t cry. I\u2019m okay.\u201d He muttered similar phrases, his English liberally sprinkled with Spanish. They could hear sirens in the distance and shouting as James and the other driver argued about something, but neither Dante nor Cleo moved, or even looked in that direction.</p><p>When the emergency services showed up, James pointed them to Dante and Cleo, who still sat in the middle of the field. They had long since lapsed into silence, Dante holding her close while Cleo battled to stop shaking.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s bleeding,\u201d she told the paramedics as soon as they crouched down in front of them.</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s pregnant,\u201d Dante informed them, as one of the men applied pressure to the bleeding wound above his right eyebrow, where a shard of the shattered window had narrowly missed his eye.</p><p>Her hand went to her bump at the mention of her pregnancy\u2014of course it would be the first thing Dante thought about in a situation like this. No wonder he\u2019d been so worried about her. There\u2019d be no baby without a healthy Cleo.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t even occurred to Cleo to be concerned about the baby. Her baby was fine. She\u2019d know if it wasn\u2019t. Still, it would be wise to check. She gave the bump a reassuring pat and stood up with the overeager assistance of two paramedics and one apprehensive-looking Spaniard. One of the paramedics attempted to steer her toward the waiting ambulance, but Dante stepped between them and took her elbow, as if she were the most fragile thing in the world.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d he said firmly, and the paramedics exchanged glances before shrugging and smoothly moving to flank the hobbling couple as they slowly made their way toward the ambulance.</p> <p>A second ambulance was just arriving, and so were the police. James left the other driver with the emergency responders and strode toward them.</p><p>\u201cYou both okay?\u201d he asked, his sharp gaze taking in their injuries, or lack thereof, in a single glance.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Dante replied, while the paramedics were checking their vital signs. \u201cWhat about that guy?\u201d</p><p>James made a disgusted sound.</p><p>\u201cDrunk. And feeling confrontational even though he can barely stand upright. He actually wanted to get back into his wrecked car and drive off. I had to take his keys. The fool thought this was an intersection and blasted through the red light. If you hadn\u2019t been driving by at that exact moment, he would have wound up in this field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re lucky it wasn\u2019t worse,\u201d Cleo whispered, her hand going to her abdomen as she considered the awful possibilities. It was bad enough that Dante was injured.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re both going to have to come to the hospital with us,\u201d one of the paramedics said sternly. \u201cSir, we have to rule out concussion, and we need to make sure that everything is in order with your wife\u2019s pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not . . . ,\u201d she began.</p><p>But Dante cut her short with a terse, \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>He helped her into the ambulance and climbed in after her.</p><p>\u201cThe cops are going to want to speak with you both,\u201d James said as the paramedics shut the doors. \u201cI\u2019ll let them know which hospital they\u2019re taking you to, and I\u2019ll pick you up from there.\u201d</p><p>Dante merely nodded, and his efficient bodyguard took control of the situation.</p><p>Endless hours later, Dante was given the all-clear. No concussion, but it was still a nasty bump to the head, and he needed to call a doctor immediately if he suffered headaches, nausea, or blurred vision. He had five stitches above his eyebrow and a bruise forming on his cheek. Cleo had a tender chest from the impact of the airbag but no damage to her ribs or sternum and was treated for shock. The baby seemed fine, but they warned her to rest for the next few days and to contact her OB/GYN as soon as possible if there was any unusual cramping or bleeding.</p><p>They\u2019d both made statements to the police and were assured that the driver of the other car would be arrested on drunk-driving charges, and since it wasn\u2019t his first offense, he would likely be stripped of his license. Happy with that outcome, the exhausted couple gratefully followed James to Dante\u2019s second car, which he\u2019d picked up after dropping off Cleo\u2019s hatchback. Cleo eyed the gleaming navy-blue car in amusement and arched a look at James.</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you think my beat-up old Volkswagen was good enough for His Majesty over here?\u201d</p><p>James grinned. \u201cI thought you\u2019d both be a lot more comfortable in the Mercedes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood call,\u201d Dante said, his voice leaden with exhaustion and pain.</p><p>It was close to one in the morning by the time they finally got home. After saying good night to James, they wearily made their way up to the penthouse. Once there, Dante stumbled up to his room. Cleo trailed after him, wanting to be sure he made it to bed okay. She\u2019d never seen him this sluggish, and it concerned her. She still worried about his head injury, even though the doctor assured them it was minor, and she knew it was probably the painkillers making him groggy. He dragged off his clothes, keeping on his black boxer briefs and black socks, and threw himself facedown on the bed without saying a word. Cleo didn\u2019t even think he was aware of her presence in his room. She tried to convince herself that he would be fine if she left and reluctantly turned to exit the room.</p><p>He said something, his voice muffled by the pillow, and she stopped, turning to look at him. He didn\u2019t appear to have moved a muscle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you say something?\u201d she whispered, in case she\u2019d imagined the sound. He turned to look at her. The bruise was taking on a livid, purplish hue, and his eye was swollen almost shut.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d he said gruffly, and she wavered before admitting to herself that she didn\u2019t want to leave him anyway.</p><p>\u201cJust for a while,\u201d she conceded. She took off her jacket and pulled one of the decorative chairs over to the bed. She curled up in it, pulling her bare feet up and tucking them beneath her butt.</p><p>With only his bedside lamp providing light, the room felt cozier than it actually was. She could see him clearly in the warm, yellow glow but knew that she was sitting just outside the little circle of light and was not as easily visible to him, which allowed her to study his features hungrily. Even with the swelling, the gauzy patch above his eye, and the bruises, he was still a remarkably good-looking man. But that wasn\u2019t what riveted her\u2014instead, it was the naked vulnerability she could see on his face that held her captive. She doubted that he was even aware of the expression; he was on the verge of falling asleep, every muscle in his body and face going limp as his exhaustion overtook him.</p> <p>Cleo stayed awhile longer, watching him, enjoying the silence and knowing that despite the closeness they\u2019d experienced tonight, tomorrow would see them back in their respective corners, facing off in the endless battlefield that was their relationship.</p><p>She waited until she was certain he was asleep, then stumbled to her own room and crawled into bed after taking off the least amount of clothes necessary for her to be comfortable. And then she fell into a thankfully dreamless slumber.</p><p>\u201cYou look awful,\u201d Cleo said with a wince when Dante joined her for breakfast the following morning. \u201cJeez, does that hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a sonofabitch,\u201d he grunted, gingerly probing at his swollen eye with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch it,\u201d she admonished. \u201cYou\u2019ll make it worse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow are you this morning?\u201d he asked, peering at her through his one good eye.</p><p>\u201cFine. I have a huge bruise on my chest from the airbag, and the entire area is a bit tender, but it\u2019s nothing serious.\u201d It actually hurt more than she was letting on because of her already sensitive breasts, but there was no point in complaining since there wasn\u2019t any pain medication she\u2019d feel comfortable taking anyway.</p><p>Dante poured himself a cup of coffee and sat down at the table opposite Cleo, who was having a bowl of cereal.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not eating?\u201d she asked, and he made a face and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to do something today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like what?\u201d Cleo asked in confusion, and Dante shrugged, looking a little discomfited.</p> <p>\u201cI was thinking we\u2019re heading into week twenty, and Baby\u2019s about the length of a banana, so we should probably call her Nan this week.\u201d The baby had been Tom last week because he\u2019d been about the size of an heirloom tomato. It was a silly game that had evolved between them when they\u2019d discovered a fruit-and-vegetable-comparative-size chart to go along with their weekly growth updates. She\u2019d been Pepper at week eighteen, when they\u2019d first started this game. \u201cI thought we could go do some shopping for her room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we don\u2019t even know how big the room will be,\u201d Cleo said, and Dante\u2019s face became an expressionless mask.</p><p>\u201cCleo, you can\u2019t mean to move out as soon as she\u2019s born? You\u2019ll need help during those first few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonths?\u201d she squeaked. \u201cYou expect me to stay here for months after she\u2019s born? Dante, no. You said you\u2019d help us find a place to stay; it\u2019s in the contract, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m expecting from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get Mrs. Clarke started on the search for a place first thing in the morning,\u201d he said after a long silence, and her shoulders slumped in relief. She shoved her half-eaten cereal aside.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Mrs. Whitman now,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019d forgotten.\u201d He stared down into his cup of coffee as if it held the key to unlocking all the secrets in the universe.</p><p>\u201cWe could go window shopping,\u201d he suggested. \u201cAnd maybe get a basic idea of the stuff you\u2019d need for Nan\u2019s nursery.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you so keen on doing this?\u201d she asked, and he lifted and dropped his shoulders again.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I want to feel involved,\u201d he said. \u201cOr maybe I\u2019m just bored and want to get out of here today. This seems to be the most productive thing to do, and it is an activity that would interest both of us.\u201d</p><p>His answer surprised her.</p><p>\u201cYou would find shopping for baby stuff interesting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never bought baby things before. It would be educational, at the very least.\u201d</p><p>Cleo considered his words; she did need some new clothes, since her skirts and trousers were getting too tight in the waist. She\u2019d been thinking of getting a few maternity dresses. But she didn\u2019t want them to be obviously maternity dresses. She always imagined awful, frumpy, tentlike frocks whenever she thought of maternity wear, and those were so not her style. She was hoping to find some fun, loose tops and dresses and drawstring trousers and skirts, which her changing body could grow into.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure you\u2019re up to it, I wouldn\u2019t mind going out. I need some stuff anyway.\u201d</p><p>Their first stop was a large high-end baby store in Green Point, and the moment she set foot inside, Cleo was overwhelmed by the sheer amount of tastefully displayed products. This wasn\u2019t at all what she\u2019d expected from a baby shop. Discreet and soothing tunes played in the background, and the place smelled like expensive wood. There were no price tags in sight, which made Cleo nervous. They were approached by several salespersons, all of whom homed in on Cleo and Dante like sharks smelling fresh blood, and Cleo felt a little intimidated by the predatory gleam in their eyes. A woman about two years younger than Cleo reached them first, and her colleagues backed off and disappeared into the woodwork, like wraiths. The saleswoman turned a hundred-watt smile onto her potential new clients. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood morning, ma\u2019am, sir . . . I\u2019m Kate. May I be of assistance?\u201d Cleo peered at Dante, who\u2014with his arms folded across his chest\u2014seemed to be waiting for her to say something. Cleo was tempted to turn down Kate\u2019s offer, but another look around the bewildering array of baby paraphernalia and Dante\u2019s impassive face changed her mind for her.</p><p>\u201cI need . . . well, everything,\u201d she said helplessly. She felt a little inadequate when she acknowledged to herself that she wasn\u2019t certain exactly what babies needed, aside from love, care, food, and clothing. As she watched Kate\u2019s smile transform from a hundred watts to a hundred thousand megawatts, Cleo realized it was the worst reply she could have given.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d Kate said smugly, \u201cyou\u2019ve come to the right place, because we have everything.\u201d She lowered her eyes to Cleo\u2019s barely protruding stomach, and her smile turned simpering. \u201cYour first?\u201d Cleo nodded, and Kate\u2019s smile became beatific. She certainly had an amazing variety of smiles.</p><p>\u201cHow far along are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust on five months,\u201d Cleo replied.</p><p>\u201cBabies are wonderful, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Kate gushed. \u201cSo full of life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d Cleo\u2019s response was dry. \u201cI don\u2019t have a baby yet.\u201d</p><p>Dante made a little choking sound that Cleo was coming to recognize as his attempt at disguising a laugh. Another quick look in his direction confirmed that his lips had tilted upward, even while he kept his gaze firmly averted from Cleo\u2019s. Kate\u2019s smile faded somewhat; she clearly did not like having the obvious pointed out to her.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d The woman nodded before going into full-on sales mode. \u201cWell, the best place to start would be with a crib. If you\u2019ll follow me, we have a fantastic variety, which I am sure you\u2019ll adore! Everything we have here is for display purposes, and your crib will be built to order, so we can change aspects of any design if you\u2019re not happy with something. We could even custom-build one for you based on a design you have in mind. So it\u2019s a good thing you came to us this early, because it takes time to make, especially if you\u2019re purchasing matching furniture, which will also have to be built to order.\u201d</p> <p>Kate led them to the cribs in the back, and even to Cleo\u2019s untrained eye, she could tell that everything was ridiculously expensive. While Kate was lauding the merits of one of the beautiful cribs, Cleo gravitated toward a smaller, less conspicuous one tucked away in the back. While not as beautiful as the rest, it definitely looked less pricey.</p><p>\u201cThis one looks okay,\u201d she said, running her hands over the plain, unadorned surface of the crib. Actually this plain, boxy little thing was not something she had ever pictured her baby in, but if she wasn\u2019t going to feel beholden to Dante for the rest of her life, instinct told her this was the one to take.</p><p>\u201cI rather like this one.\u201d Dante spoke for the first time since they\u2019d entered the store, and both women looked at him in surprise. He was standing beside a crib smaller than the one Kate was gushing over but bigger than the one Cleo had been eyeing.</p><p>Truth be told, it was perfect\u2014not too small and not too ostentatious either. She knew what he was doing; he was trying to help, without flaunting his obvious ability to buy the most expensive and best. He was allowing her some measure of pride and independence, and she was grateful to him for that. But a cynical part of her brain hissed that if he didn\u2019t want to flaunt his ability to buy the most expensive, then maybe he shouldn\u2019t have brought her to this snooty upmarket store.</p><p>She walked over to the crib while he examined its lines and tested its durability with a keen masculine eye. He asked Kate about the toxicity of the varnish they used and other technical questions that wouldn\u2019t have occurred to Cleo. The girl\u2019s answers seemed to satisfy him, because he nodded approvingly with each of her replies before turning back to Cleo.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sturdy,\u201d he informed her quietly before testing the catches. \u201cAnd the rail isn\u2019t likely to come down accidentally. The baby should be safe in here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she murmured thoughtfully, pretending to consider, even though he\u2019d sold her on it already. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty too. I love the little pixies and fairies carved into the head- and footboards, as well as the mobile.\u201d She touched the colourful mobile, which swayed at her touch. The mobile consisted of winged fairies and cavorting pixies and elves.</p><p>\u201cI like this one,\u201d she told Kate, who jumped to attention and enthused over their \u201cwise choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis particular model comes in teak, oak, and pine. Obviously the price varies according to the wood you choose. Which would you prefer?\u201d</p><p>Cleo considered the choices, while Kate pulled out a catalog to show her the difference in the wood.</p><p>\u201cTeak.\u201d She ran her finger over the carvings in the headboard of the crib and thought of her own bed. She liked the idea of them matching, and she pictured Nan sleeping contentedly in this crib and smiled. Kate practically vibrated with excitement as she wrote down the details of the order and then took them toward the changing tables.</p><p>\u201cThat was an excellent choice, Dante. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t notice it at first.\u201d He looked pleased with her praise and grinned like a little boy.</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Thank you. And it has given me an idea for the nursery. What do you think of a fairy-tale motif?\u201d</p> <p>Dante hesitated, a little surprised that she\u2019d asked for his opinion. He didn\u2019t want to do anything that could spoil what was turning out to be a pretty good day . . . but he really had to tell her what he thought of this idea of fairies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou want my honest opinion?\u201d he asked. They were both ignoring poor Kate\u2019s frantic attempts to get their attention, while Cleo lowered her eyelashes and pretended to consider his question.</p><p>\u201cHonesty would be appreciated,\u201d she said demurely.</p><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s a boy?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou can\u2019t seriously want to surround the kid with fairies and pixies? That\u2019s girlie stuff!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not!\u201d she argued, quite affronted by this view. \u201cFairies and pixies sometimes have a dangerous air to them, and they\u2019re appealing to a child of any sex. If it\u2019s a boy and he wants to change his room later, that would be entirely up to him.\u201d He didn\u2019t respond; instead he gazed at her impassively.</p> <p>Cleo couldn\u2019t read his expression and wasn\u2019t certain of his mood, especially since he was wearing dark glasses to hide part of his shiner. His lips thinned and he sighed quietly.</p><p>\u201cMust you argue? You seem to forget that you asked for my opinion,\u201d he said gravely. \u201cCleo, sometimes you can be so damned . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrustrating?\u201d she supplied with a sympathetic nod.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnoying?\u201d she guessed, and he gave her the Look, which shut her up immediately. He really was so super anal about her finishing his sentences.</p> <p>\u201cCute,\u201d he said with playful smile, and shocked the hell right out of her. \u201cSometimes you can be so damned cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Well, how else was she supposed to respond to that? \u201cAre you flirting with me?\u201d She really couldn\u2019t tell. Dante Damaso did nothing conventionally.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I were?\u201d he asked speculatively, and she pondered over that for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d tell you to stop,\u201d she finally replied. \u201cIt\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m wooing you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTo what end?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know what,\u201d he countered, confirming her worst fear.</p><p>\u201cWell, stop it at once. I gave you my answer Friday night. It\u2019s not just a no, it\u2019s a hell no.\u201d As if she would marry a man who didn\u2019t love her.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said so casually that she blinked at him uncertainly. His response was unexpectedly easygoing, and it threw her a little.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming you have the accompanying pieces to this crib.\u201d He directed the comment to Kate, who\u2019d been watching their exchange with interest.</p><p>\u201cUh. Yes. Of course.\u201d She was just way too enthusiastic. Cleo wished the woman would tone it down a bit. She was starting to develop a headache and was questioning the wisdom of coming out so soon after the accident. Her entire body ached, from her shoulders on down. She followed the other two a little sluggishly, and when Kate told them that the matching changing table and dresser were must-haves, she found herself unable to argue with the woman.</p><p>A stroller, a baby bouncer, a rocking chair, and a car seat later, Cleo\u2014deciding new clothes could wait another day or two\u2014pleaded exhaustion, and Dante, who was also looking a bit pale and peaked, agreed that it was best to head home. She went straight up to bed when they got home and fell asleep almost instantly.</p><p>Her sleep was restless and filled with disturbing dreams, and when she awoke hours later, it was to an even worse headache. She took a warm bath to try and relax her muscles and ease her tension, and it seemed to work to a certain extent. Her headache had definitely diminished enough for her to face going downstairs to dinner.</p><p>Dante was in the kitchen, cooking something that smelled divine. He smiled when he saw her.</p> <p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re hungry,\u201d he said, and she sat down at the island to watch him. The scene was reminiscent of that first night he\u2019d cooked for her.</p><p>\u201cI could eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made some paella, my second stepmother\u2019s recipe. That woman was a genius in the kitchen, which was great, since none of the old man\u2019s other wives bothered. They thought cooking was beneath them, and they married a rich man so cooking was something the chef did.\u201d</p><p>He was unusually forthcoming tonight, and Cleo rested her cheek in the palm of her hand and idly traced the pattern of veins on the marble countertop.</p><p>\u201cDid you like any of your stepmothers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one, Stepmom Number Two? She was my favorite. Taught me a thing or two about cooking. The rest were just . . .\u201d His voice faded as he thought about it. \u201cI don\u2019t know, interchangeable maybe. After Number Two, I stopped trying to get to know them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you act out?\u201d Cleo asked, thinking of her own rebellious years.</p><p>\u201cI was a good kid, got the best grades and stayed out of trouble. I didn\u2019t have many friends. I still don\u2019t.\u201d And he\u2019d lost one of his best friends because of her, Cleo thought, swallowing past a lump in her throat. \u201cIt was only when I hit puberty that I started getting into fights, and my father thought it best for me to take boxing classes in order to channel that aggression. It worked. One of his more sound parental decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you get along with him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe get along now. He wasn\u2019t too happy when I decided to stay here. However, since I\u2019ve made a success of the business, he\u2019s back in the black and able to fund his current wife-to-be, Carmen\u2019s, spendthrift ways. So he\u2019s come to accept the idea. I love him, he\u2019s my papa, but we\u2019re not friends. If we go a year or more without seeing each other, both of us are fine with that. We\u2019re both happy with a few Skype sessions a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said with a little shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s life. Sometimes we get along with our parents, and sometimes we don\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her hand went to her abdomen, and she silently promised her child better than that. Dante\u2019s eyes followed her hand to her stomach, and his Adam\u2019s apple bobbed as he swallowed thickly.</p><p>\u201cI would want a different relationship with her,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI didn\u2019t know this at first, Cleo, but I do know it now. I want to be a real father to Nan, and I don\u2019t want her to go through the turmoil of numerous stepparents. Just us. Her mother and father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re proposing is a cold and cynical arrangement that will result in a cold and cynical environment unsuited for raising a child.

Not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to . . .\u201d He hesitated, clearly picking his words carefully. \u201cI\u2019ve come to like and respect you, Cleo, and I do think we can have a good marriage together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d She jumped up and planted her hands on her hips. \u201cThat\u2019s not enough, Dante! I don\u2019t want good. I want amazing; I want fantastic; I want blissful. I want love, and you can\u2019t give that to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I can\u2019t?\u201d His handsome face was a study in frustration and building anger. Cleo gasped at his words and pinned him with a glare.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare treat me with such condescension and downright contempt, Dante. I\u2019m not an idiot, so don\u2019t even think about going down that road. I don\u2019t need the \u2018someday we might come to love each other\u2019 speech. I don\u2019t want to hear it. It\u2019s insulting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t easy for me either, Cleo,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI\u2019m trying my damnedest to think of ways we can make this work for both of us, and you\u2019re not making it easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about this again,\u201d she maintained, rolling her aching shoulders as she headed back toward the staircase.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel like doing this with you right now,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m headed back to my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lost my appetite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCleo, you should eat for the baby\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDante, I can\u2019t sit at that table with you and pretend that every-thing is just fine. I wish to God that I\u2019d never agreed to live here with you. It was a dumb decision that has already cost me my pride, my independence, and my brother.\u201d He flinched and went as white as a sheet at the last two words, but Cleo refused to feel any guilt over it. It was time Dante Damaso accepted that, for once, he wasn\u2019t going to get his way.</p> <p>She was sitting on her bed, listlessly clicking through the multitude of channels available on the wall-mounted large-screen television, when a sharp knock sounded on her door. She ignored it and sighed impatiently when the door swung open despite her lack of response. Dante stepped in and placed a loaded tray on her dresser before leaving without saying a word.</p><p>Cleo couldn\u2019t ignore the heavenly aromas and got off the bed to investigate the contents. There was a small bowl of salad beside a plate laden with delicious-looking seafood paella and a slice of rich, moist chocolate cake on a side plate. He had also been thoughtful enough to include a silver carafe of cold water. Cleo\u2019s mouth watered. She dragged over a chair and sat right at the dresser and scarfed down half of the paella and salad in one go. It was absolutely perfect.</p><p>Definitely one of the perks of living with Dante was his cooking; the man loved being in the kitchen, and it showed in the meals he prepared. After polishing off her meal, she practically inhaled the cake, which was absolutely delicious, and there was no doubt in her mind that it had been baked by Dante.</p><p>After finishing, she considered going downstairs to thank him, but the thought of going another round with him was mentally exhausting, so she sent him a thank-you text instead.</p><p>You\u2019re welcome. Glad you enjoyed it.</p><p>His response was almost immediate. She contemplated sending him a smiley face or something in return but decided to leave it at that. Ten minutes went by before her phone buzzed again.</p><p>Want to watch Star Trek with me?</p><p>It was the equivalent of a white flag, since Star Trek had become kind of an in-joke between them, but she didn\u2019t think she could face him again tonight.</p> <p>No thanks. Tired. Going to sleep.</p><p>Good night.</p><p>She decided not to respond to his \u201cGood night\u201d and curled up on her bed, her hand on her little bump. Nan shifted gently beneath her touch, and Cleo smiled before falling asleep with the TV still on.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>She awoke with a gasp. The TV was on, playing quietly in the background, the light flickering in the darkened room.</p><p>Something\u2019s wrong. She tried to push herself up and nearly doubled over in pain. This wasn\u2019t right. She tried to stand again, and this time succeeded for a few seconds before her knees buckled, and she groaned as excruciating pain knifed through her abdomen.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she moaned. She braced her palm on the night table and pushed herself up again, managing to keep her balance as she hugged the wall all the way to the bathroom. It was only when she got into the brightly lit room that she saw she was bleeding. The horror of the realization impacted her like a freight train, and she sat down on the commode as she tried to wrap her head around what was happening.</p><p>\u201cDante.\u201d His name was just a whisper, as her breath was stolen from her by another sharp pain. She gritted her teeth and clung to the basin beside the commode. After the pain had passed, she managed to inhale; Dante\u2019s name emerged on the exhalation. This time it was a scream. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dante sat up with a frown; he\u2019d fallen asleep while watching the movie and was still sitting in the living room. He focused his bleary gaze on his watch face and saw that it was after three in the morning. He must have been more tired than he thought. He rolled his shoulders and his neck, working the kinks out, when he heard Cleo scream.</p><p>Unnerved by the fear he heard in her voice, he was up the stairs mere seconds later and in her room in under a minute.</p><p>\u201cCleo?\u201d he called, alarmed when he stepped into the room and she was nowhere to be found. He heard sobs coming from the bathroom and dashed to it only to stop at the door at the scene that met his eyes.</p><p>There was so much blood. Violent red smeared the white tiles of the floor. Cleo was bent double on the commode, clutching her arms to her middle and rocking back and forth.</p><p>She lifted her tear-stained face to his as he entered the room.</p><p>\u201cMake it stop,\u201d she pleaded, her voice weak. \u201cPlease make it stop.\u201d</p><p>Swallowing down the fear and panic clawing its way up through his throat, he grabbed a towel and knelt in front of her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, dulzura; it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll take care of you. It will be fine.\u201d He handed her the wadded-up towel. \u201cUse this to stop the bleeding while I call an ambulance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me,\u201d she begged as he turned to exit the room.</p><p>\u201cJust to the next room to get your phone. I\u2019ll be back in a second,\u201d he promised. Her phone was on the night table beside the bed, and he quickly dialed emergency services, then found the number for her OB/GYN and told her to meet them at the hospital. When he returned to the bathroom, Cleo was clutching the already blood-soaked towel between her legs. He grabbed more and held out a fresh one to her.</p><p>This was too much blood. Cleo could go into shock. Feeling helpless for the first time in his life, Dante tried to think logically. He needed to keep her warm. He ran back into the room and tugged the comforter off the bed and came back moments later to wrap it around her.</p><p>\u201cWhy is this happening?\u201d she wondered dazedly. \u201cAm I being punished because I didn\u2019t want her at first? I want her. I want her so much, Dante!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, dulzura, I want her too. She\u2019ll be fine. You\u2019ll be fine. Just stay strong for me, okay?\u201d</p><p>He gathered Cleo into his arms, comforter and all, and sank down onto the bathroom floor with her head tucked beneath his chin. She was trembling, a delicate armful of woman, and he just wanted to hold her close and keep her safe.</p><p>Cleo and Dante lost their baby at six thirty that morning. Cleo stared at Dr. Klein in horror as the grim-faced woman told them the news. She heard fragments of sentences.</p><p>Placental abruption . . . possibly caused by the accident . . . early labor . . . autopsy . . . couldn\u2019t be helped . . . just one of those things.</p><p>Just one of those things.</p><p>Her baby had been taken from her, and she felt hollow, but it was just one of those things. One of those silly things that happened for no reason. She was empty inside now, and while she watched the doctor\u2019s lips move, she heard nothing further. She didn\u2019t want to hear.</p><p>Dante was still here. Hovering. Why was he still here? He could leave now. His sole reason for being in her life was gone, and he didn\u2019t have to be here. She didn\u2019t have the will or the energy to tell him that now. She just wished they would leave her alone. She needed to be alone.</p><p>\u201cCleo, do you want to say good-bye?\u201d Dr. Klein\u2019s voice intruded into her roiling thoughts. Grateful that they were finally leaving, she nodded numbly.</p><p>\u201cYes, good-bye.\u201d But they didn\u2019t leave. Instead, someone else came into the room. A woman. And in her arms she held . . .</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d This was cruel. This was . . . why were they doing this to her? Why were they bringing her dead baby to her? Before she could protest, the woman had placed the not-living thing in her arms. Just a little thing, the length of a banana.</p><p>\u201cOh, Nan,\u201d she whispered, and her heart broke open in her chest as she stared into that perfect little face. He looked like a tiny plastic replica of a full-size baby. He was wrapped in a blue blanket, and they\u2019d put a minute hat on his head. She ran a trembling forefinger over his forehead, down over the bridge of his nose, to his lips and jaw.</p> <p>Then Dante was there, his own finger following hers as it traced over the precious little features reverently.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone,\u201d Cleo hissed, not sure if she meant Dante, the doctor, or just the world in general. The doctor and nurse left the room quietly, but Dante remained standing there. She clutched her baby protectively to her breast and glared up into Dante\u2019s remote face. Tears clung to her eyelashes before they spilled down over her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me leave,\u201d he begged. \u201cPlease, cielo, I can\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to deal with him too; she was in too much agony to have to think about him, consider him . . . it was all too much!</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this alone and neither can you,\u201d he muttered as he pressed his lips to her forehead, but she barely felt the kiss; she was cold and numb and didn\u2019t think she would ever feel anything again.</p><p>\u201cI want to name him Zachary,\u201d she whispered. \u201cZach Damaso Knight.\u201d</p><p>She heard a sound very like a sob torn from him, but she still refused to look at him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so perfect,\u201d she marveled. \u201cSo perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He sat on the edge of the bed, one arm around her shaking shoulders and his jaw resting on top of her head as they stared down at Zach. Cleo didn\u2019t know how long they sat there, but when the numbness finally gave way to exhaustion, Dante continued to hold her while she slipped into a restless slumber. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she next woke up, it was to harsh sunlight streaming through the bare window. Memories flooded back, and she sat up and looked around the room frantically. There were cards and flowers on every available surface. How had people gotten word of this so quickly? Dante was asleep in an uncomfortable-looking chair, his chin on his chest and his long legs sprawled out in front of him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she muttered, panic lacing her voice when she couldn\u2019t find what she was looking for. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>The sharp cry woke Dante, and he sat up quickly, his face etched with grief and concern as his eyes immediately flew to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d she demanded, trying to pull the IV lines out of her arms so that she could get off the bed to search. He jumped up and put a hand over her frantically tugging fingers.</p><p>\u201cStop that, Cleo.\u201d His voice was rough with sleep, and she noted that his eyes were bloodshot, his jaw black with stubble, and his hair stood up in tufts. \u201cYou\u2019ll hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did they take my baby?\u201d she screamed. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCleo, they had to take him down to the . . .\u201d His words ground to a halt, as if he were physically incapable of saying the next one.</p><p>\u201cTake him where?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know where,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDownstairs. To the . . . to the morgue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! He belongs here, with me,\u201d she said, her voice anguished. \u201cHow could you let them take him away from me? How could you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCleo, be reasonable,\u201d he begged. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t stay here. They had to take him. To p-preserve\u2014\u201d Again he stumbled, and this time seemed completely unable of finishing what he\u2019d been trying to say. She heard a high, thin wail, and for a second didn\u2019t register that it had come from her. Dante\u2014alarmed by the sound\u2014reached for her, trying to gather her into his arms, but she resisted his embrace, pushing him away, and his eyes flared with pain as he stepped back.</p><p>Cleo turned away from him until she was facing the opposite wall, and curled into a tight ball. It hurt to have him here. She wanted him gone.</p><p>\u201cLuc and Blue were here,\u201d he said, determinedly disregarding the fact that she was ignoring him. \u201cAnd Cal called. The pink roses are from him.\u201d</p><p>He kept talking and talking even though she stubbornly refused to acknowledge his presence. He told her that Blue and Luc had promised to return later and that they both sent their love. Susan Killian had sent flowers, as had James, Mrs. Whitman, and Coco and Gigi. But she didn\u2019t care. She didn\u2019t care about any of those people. How could they possibly understand how this felt? Zach had trusted her to take care of him, depended on her, and she had failed. Utterly failed him. Her hand went down to her abdomen, wishing she could feel him move again. Willing any kind of movement that would tell her that this was nothing more than a horrible nightmare, but it never came.</p> <p>Her baby was gone. He was dead. And all the smiles, the first step, the first word, his first day of school, the long and beautiful life he should have led were gone with him. The unbearable agony that came with that gaping sense of loss was immeasurable, and the tears that finally came flooding out in no way at all helped her feel better.</p><p>She felt Dante climb onto the bed behind her and curve his body around hers. It was a tight fit, but he made it work. His arm crept over her waist, and his hand came to rest over hers on her abdomen. He held her as she cried, and while initially she tried to resist the comfort he offered, in the end she was grateful for his solid warmth and silent support.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to hold him again,\u201d she said into the silence, her voice thick after her onslaught of tears. \u201cThe morgue is cold. It\u2019s not the place for him. He\u2019s so tiny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, tightening his arm around her waist. \u201cI didn\u2019t want them to take him either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your fault,\u201d she accused. The words seemed to come from out of nowhere, but she found herself needing to blame someone, needing to hate someone, and hating Dante right now was so much easier than loving him. She couldn\u2019t love anybody right now; love led to loss and pain.</p><p>\u201cWe can go down and see him when you\u2019re feeling a little calmer,\u201d he said, misunderstanding her. He withdrew his arm from around her waist, and she felt him get off the bed, leaving her cold and alone. But that was what she wanted. She couldn\u2019t depend on him; she refused to depend on him. Not when he would inevitably move on with his life and leave her behind. She turned around to face him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d she corrected, amazed by how calm her voice sounded. \u201cYou did this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He seemed to lose every ounce of blood he had; his usually swarthy skin went completely white. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is your fault.\u201d Her voice rose and became shrill as the nascent thought gained momentum. \u201cThe Great Dante Damaso always knows best, doesn\u2019t he? He always gets his own way! If I hadn\u2019t gotten into that car with you on Saturday night, if I\u2019d driven myself back, this would never have happened. But you would never have let me, would you? Because you always know best!\u201d</p><p>He stepped back, stumbling over the visitor\u2019s chair as he shook his head. His eyes were bright and feverish, and his face looked carved from granite.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t mean that. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying,\u201d he said. His voice was urgent and rough with emotion. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t my fault, Cleo; how can you say that it was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the moment I met you, every single thing in my life went wrong,\u201d she sobbed, and he shook his head again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo not blame me for your life, Cleo. It was a fucked-up mess before I ever met you,\u201d he snapped, and then took a deep breath as he tried to get his spiraling emotions under control. He held up his hands in surrender. \u201cYou\u2019re in pain, I get that. You\u2019re hurting, but don\u2019t do this . . . not now. Let\u2019s be the parents Zach deserves; let\u2019s give him a dignified and loving farewell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to be together to do that.\u201d She kept her face and voice remote and cold. \u201cI want you to leave. Go home. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to be alone,\u201d he protested, his face clenching in frustration.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Your being here makes this worse; don\u2019t you get that?\u201d Her voice was bordering on shrill again, and he backed away.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up tomorrow.\u201d He probably sensed that she was on the verge of losing it completely and that his presence really just exacerbated her distress. He approached her again, with the extreme wariness of a man reaching out to pet a snake, and before she knew his intention, he dropped a kiss on her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing this under protest, Cleo,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019d stay here all day and through the night if you\u2019d let me. Try to get some rest, okay? I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply, just watched as he picked up his jacket and left without a backward glance. After she was sure he was gone and wouldn\u2019t be back, she curled up on her side, stared out at the blue sky visible from her window, and allowed the tears to come again.</p><p>Blue and Luc showed up a couple of hours later, and Cleo burst into fresh tears when she saw her brother hover uncertainly in the doorway. His face just crumpled as he made his way to her bedside and gathered her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Pattypan! I was such an asshole,\u201d he whispered into her hair.</p> <p>\u201cMy baby died,\u201d she told him, and his arms tightened around her at the words. \u201cHe was so beautiful, Luc. I named him Zachary Damaso Knight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said again, still holding her close, and she felt comforted by his embrace. But the solace she found in his hug made her guiltily think of Dante and acknowledge to herself that he didn\u2019t have anyone to offer him this comfort. She shoved that thought aside, telling herself that he would be okay, he hadn\u2019t felt the same depth of love for Zach, he\u2019d been going through the motions, trying to do the right thing.</p><p>He would bounce back.</p><p>\u201cPlease, take me home,\u201d she begged her brother.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he assured her. \u201cAs soon as they give you the all clear, we\u2019ll get your stuff from Dante\u2019s and . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, take me home now! Today.\u201d She felt a pang of loss at having to leave Zach behind, and she very nearly changed her mind. Earlier, after Dante left, she had demanded they bring Zach up to her again and had sat in a rocking chair for an hour just singing to him until her voice hoarsened. Afterward, when she resisted their attempts to take him from her, they gave her a mild sedative and very gently but firmly removed him from her grasp. A grief counselor had been dispatched to her room and told Cleo that the anger she felt was normal, but nothing the woman said had helped. Nothing anybody said or did could help or make her feel better. Nothing could make this gaping chasm in her soul go away.</p> <p>Dante restlessly paced from empty room to empty room, avoiding the bloodied bathroom in Cleo\u2019s room. He knew he would have to clean it up before she came home again. He didn\u2019t want her to see it. He doubted she even knew how much blood she\u2019d lost, and the memory of the fear and panic he\u2019d felt at the time surged back.</p><p>He had gone over it and over it in his head. Maybe if he\u2019d done something differently he could have saved the baby. Maybe if he\u2019d heard her cry out sooner. Or perhaps if he\u2019d helped her apply pressure to stop the bleeding. Maybe if he hadn\u2019t insisted they go shopping that afternoon. He swallowed back bile as he remembered how he had pressed her. He should have used his common sense, but he had selfishly wanted to spend that time with her and hoped an inoffensive pastime like shopping would make her see him in a positive light. Would make her consider marrying him.</p><p>His mind kept coming back to her words in the hospital. Even though she voluntarily gave up her keys, she had only done so to avoid a prolonged argument with him. An argument he\u2019d had no intention of losing, and she knew that. She was right, this was his fault, and he didn\u2019t blame her for hating him right now and for not wanting to be around him. He hated himself and could barely stand his own company right now.</p><p>He found a bucket, scrub brush, and some detergent, and after mentally bracing himself, he stepped into the bathroom.</p><p>Oh God. It was worse than he remembered; the blood was smeared on the white tiled floor, the side of the bath, in the basin, on the commode, even on the wall. He swallowed back his nausea and went about the solemn task of cleaning up the last vestiges of Cleo\u2019s pregnancy. Once he completed the grim job to his satisfaction, he finally allowed himself to succumb to his nausea and lost his meager lunch down the toilet. He stripped down where he stood, climbed into her shower, and scrubbed himself clean with delicately fragranced soap that reminded him of her. He stood beneath the buffeting, punishingly hot spray, with his hands braced on the tiled wall, his head tilted up toward the water, and finally allowed himself to grieve.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Dante stood chest to chest with his former friend and glared threateningly at the man. He\u2019d gone to the hospital only to be informed that Miss Knight had left against medical advice the previous afternoon. She left without even having the courtesy of telling him. Dante headed straight to Luc\u2019s place from the hospital. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDante,\u201d Luc greeted wearily. He was surprisingly noncombative as he stepped aside to allow Dante entry into the creaky old house.</p><p>\u201cCleo!\u201d Dante called the minute he stepped over the threshold.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not here,\u201d Luc said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking lie to me, Luc,\u201d Dante snapped. \u201cWhere the hell else would she be?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s not currently here. Her OB/GYN insisted she come in for a follow-up appointment because Cleo discharged herself early against medical advice yesterday. Blue\u2019s gone with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should be there.\u201d Dante turned to head back out, but Luc\u2019s hand on his arm stopped him.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t want you there, amigo,\u201d Luc said, looking almost sympathetic.</p><p>\u201cShe blames me for this,\u201d Dante confessed, running a hand through his hair. \u201cWe were in an accident on Saturday night, and if I hadn\u2019t been such an overbearing asshole, she would have been in her own car, safely behind us. So, she\u2019s probably right. I did this. I killed our baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Luc massaged the back of his neck as he watched his usually stoic and unemotional friend unravel right in front of his eyes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t kill your baby, Dante.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe hell of it was,\u201d Dante whispered, ignoring Luc\u2019s words, \u201cI wanted him so badly. I don\u2019t even know when it changed. I watched her growing bigger with our baby; I listened to her chatter on about ultrasounds and week-by-week growth charts. I even felt him move, Luc, and he became so real to me.\u201d</p><p>Luc steered him into a large room that, like the rest of the house, was grand but shabby. It housed a couch and a couple of mismatched love seats and armchairs. Luc pushed him onto the couch and poured him a glass of something amber. He pressed the tumbler firmly into Dante\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cDrink this,\u201d Luc insisted. Dante took a sip and winced when the Scotch hit the back of his throat.</p><p>\u201cSo why are you here, Dante?\u201d Luc asked, taking a sip from his own glass. \u201cYour responsibility to Cleo ended with her pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I can switch these emotions on and off like a machine?\u201d Dante asked resentfully, hating that his old friend would think so little of him.</p><p>\u201cWhat emotions? What you felt for the baby is unrelated to your relationship with Cleo, so you can let her move on with her life now, while you move on with yours.\u201d</p> <p>Dante stared at him mutely, not sure how to respond, not sure how he felt but knowing one thing with absolute certainty.</p><p>\u201cThere is no moving on for me without Cleo.\u201d Luc\u2019s eyes narrowed at his words, and he lifted his glass in a slight salute to Dante.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll have your work cut out convincing her of that, my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d Dante asked uncertainly, a little embarrassed by the hope and vulnerability he heard in his own voice.</p><p>\u201cAre you what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, man. Always.\u201d</p><p>And that was really all he needed to say.</p> <p>\u201cCleo?\u201d Blue\u2019s voice intruded into Cleo\u2019s darkened room. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you join Luc and me downstairs? We\u2019ve ordered a pizza\u2014with all your favorite toppings\u2014and would love it if you\u2019d have a slice or two with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d Cleo responded listlessly. She wasn\u2019t interested in eating or talking or being around people. She just wanted to lie here and stare at her favorite patch of wall.</p><p>\u201cYou have to eat something, Cleo,\u201d Blue said, her gentle voice grating on Cleo\u2019s frayed and wearied nerves.</p><p>\u201cPlease leave me alone,\u201d she begged, the ever-present tears seeping from behind her closed lids and wetting the pillow beneath her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring you a slice,\u201d Blue said quietly, and retreated from the room.</p><p>It was a week since she\u2019d lost the baby, and each day was harder than the one before it. The hospital had called to inform her that they had cremated Zach\u2019s remains and would keep his ashes until she was ready to collect them. But Cleo, whose body was still recovering from the pregnancy and the induced labor, couldn\u2019t deal with the thought of collecting the ashes of a baby she was still lactating for. Her breasts producing milk for her dead baby had been such a kick to the stomach that she was still reeling from the blow. She couldn\u2019t face the world yet; she didn\u2019t know how she would ever recover from this, didn\u2019t know how it was possible for any woman to recover from this.</p><p>To make matters worse, she missed Dante badly and thought about him constantly. She was still convinced that she\u2019d made the right decision in leaving and knew that he\u2019d probably come to that realization as well since he hadn\u2019t tried to contact her at all after that last day in the hospital. She pictured him in his office, wheeling and dealing. For all she knew, he was in Tokyo or possibly Dubai.</p><p>She told herself she didn\u2019t care what he was doing. What did it matter? He was out of her life; he would never be a part of her life again. He must be so relieved that they hadn\u2019t married, after all.</p><p>The thought brought fresh tears to her eyes, and she curled up into a tight ball, wanting to be as small as possible in an effort to shield herself from the relentless barrage of pain. This would pass. It had to pass.</p><p>Dante\u2019s initial reaction to his front door opening up unexpectedly was to hope for one wild moment that it was Cleo coming home. But when Luc stepped over the threshold instead of Cleo, Dante could do nothing but stare at the man stupidly</p><p>\u201cHow did you get in here?\u201d he asked after a long moment of silence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour guy, James, let me in. Turns out he\u2019s a little concerned about you.\u201d Luc ran a critical eye over Dante. \u201cAnd I can see why. When did you last shower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Cleo okay?\u201d he asked, ignoring his friend\u2019s question. Luc had advised him last week to give her some space, and Dante had reluctantly complied. After the accident and its terrible consequences, he had started to doubt his every decision, especially where Cleo was concerned. But not a day went by that he didn\u2019t want to tear over there and drag her back home with him. He slept in her damned bed every night, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cCleo\u2019s about the same as you,\u201d Luc said, and Dante forced away his annoyance at the cryptic response. \u201cFrom the looks of you, you haven\u2019t been eating or showering, and according to James, you haven\u2019t left the building since last week. Not even to go to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am entitled to compassionate leave, just like every one of my employees,\u201d Dante said defensively, and then immediately regretted rising to Luc\u2019s obvious baiting.</p> <p>\u201cLook, I know I told you to give Cleo space, but I take that back. She\u2019s . . . she\u2019s in a bad place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just lost her baby,\u201d Dante pointed out.</p><p>\u201cAnd so did you,\u201d Luc said with a nod. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I was wrong in telling you to give her space. Neither of you should be going through this alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t want me around,\u201d Dante said quietly.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be around?\u201d Dante gave him a look that told Luc exactly how dumb he thought that question was. \u201cThen you should be around.\u201d</p> <p>Exactly two weeks to the day after losing Zach, Cleo was wandering around the house like a wraith. Blue and Dante had both gone to work, and Cleo knew she should attempt to do something more positive than stay at home. It was a glorious summer day in mid-December, and nobody had even mentioned Christmas because her brother and Blue were both walking on eggshells around her. They had gently tried to talk her into thinking about some kind of farewell ceremony for Zach, but Cleo still couldn\u2019t bring herself to even contemplate it.</p><p>Her body was slowly returning to normal; her milk had dried up, and she\u2019d spent a day crying over that too. She didn\u2019t recognize herself anymore. Who was this woman who could spend entire days crying, and other days just staring at a wall doing nothing? She felt like she had lost herself along with the baby and couldn\u2019t find her way back.</p><p>So today was the day she would turn it all around. She would get dressed, leave the house, and buy Christmas presents for Blue and Luc. She would go to the hospital and pick up Zach\u2019s ashes . . .</p><p>Only she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>When midday rolled around, she was still in her pajamas and still just drifting from one end of the house to the other. It was almost a godsend when the doorbell rang. She yanked open the door without considering how very unfit she was to be seen by anyone.</p><p>She became very much aware of that fact moments later when she stood staring up at Dante.</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d she whispered as his eyes ran over her body wordlessly. His face was grim, and his lips thinned. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He said nothing, just pushed his way past her and into the house. That made her angry, and it felt wonderful. It was the first emotion other than sadness that she\u2019d felt in too long.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just barge in here like this, Dante.\u201d She slammed the door and turned to confront him. \u201cI . . .\u201d Her voice faltered when she saw his face. He looked seriously pissed off with her. His eyes had gone dark and intense, and it made her back up until she felt the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I know you\u2019re upset with me for just leaving the way I did,\u201d she said, trying to keep her voice level. \u201cBut you have to understand that I couldn\u2019t, I just couldn\u2019t, go back to your place.\u201d</p><p>The fixed, feverish look in his eyes was starting to freak her out, and it made her talk a little faster.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to be around people who love me and understand me.\u201d A muscle was starting to tick in his jaw, and she swallowed nervously. Why was he just staring at her like that? She wished he would just say something. She opened her mouth to say something else, but all that emerged was a squeak when he took a purposeful step toward her, then another, and then the third bridged the gap between them completely. He was way too close to her now, and she was trapped between his chest and the door.</p><p>She tilted her jaw up and met his gaze head-on. Why did he have to look so formidable? Cleo was aware of her heart beating like a maddened, trapped animal against her rib cage and\u2014even though she knew he would never physically hurt her\u2014she jumped when he brought his hands up.</p><p>He palmed her narrow shoulders and with an anguished groan, dragged her into his arms.</p> <p>\u201cDante\u2014\u201d</p><p>He interrupted whatever she had been about to say by speaking for the first time since entering the house.</p><p>\u201cJust shut up for a moment while I hold you, okay?\u201d he growled into her hair, and Cleo sighed and leaned into his embrace, relishing the feel of his protective arms around her.</p><p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d she whispered as she wrapped her arms around his waist and hugged him close.</p><p>\u201cThis happened to me too, Cleo,\u201d he said after a long, long silence, and Cleo trembled at his words. \u201cI lost him too and it hurts like hell. I need you. I can\u2019t . . . I can\u2019t do this without you. And I know that maybe I\u2019m the last person you want to be around right now because of the accident, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Guilt reared its ugly head; she should never have said those words to him. He\u2019d been dealing with the same loss, and she had made his grief so much worse by blaming him for their baby\u2019s death. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault, Dante,\u201d she said, leaning back to look up at him. There was moisture gleaming in his eyes. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t. They did an autopsy and he had a chromosomal problem, or imbalance. The accident hastened the inevitable, but our baby would never have made it. I shouldn\u2019t have put that on you. Dr. Klein called me with the results yesterday, and I know I should have called you immediately, but I was just so sad and I felt so horrible for blaming you. Even when I said those things, I knew they were awful and unfair and I wanted to call you, but I\u2014\u201d She stopped and sobbed. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to say. You must have felt so terrible. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI do. Not because of anything you said or did, but because I wanted him. I so badly wanted to be his dad.\u201d</p><p>She was crying again, and that was okay because Dante was crying too, and Cleo no longer felt alone.</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p> <p>Dante was still there when Blue and Luc came home from work that evening. Blue invited him to stay for supper, and after a quick glance at Cleo, who nodded, he happily accepted. He clung to Cleo\u2019s hand for most of the evening, and after small talk and drinks on the veranda while they listened to the waves crashing nearby, Blue and Luc excused themselves and went to bed.</p><p>Cleo sat on her grandmother\u2019s old rocking chair. She still wore the loose pajamas she had on when he arrived. Dante was on a deck chair next to her, and he took her hand for the umpteenth time that day. They didn\u2019t speak, their silence speaking for them, and after another half an hour in the cool, briny air, Dante sighed.</p><p>\u201cI should probably get going,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d she asked, genuinely confused.</p><p>\u201cIncluding me.\u201d Oh. The underlying vulnerability in those words hit her hard. He\u2019d been made to feel excluded and alone at a time when he should have had a solid support base, and it was entirely her fault. Well, that would end right now.</p> <p>\u201cStay,\u201d she invited.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay the night. As a friend.\u201d She wanted to make it perfectly clear that she was expecting nothing more than that from him. He wasn\u2019t obligated to stay with her after all this was over. She didn\u2019t want him to. But for now they each needed the other.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asked, hopeful and hesitant. She thought about it for a moment before nodding.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d She took his hand and led him upstairs to her room, which was even messier than usual for her, and for the first time since she\u2019d lost the baby, that bothered her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it\u2019s a bit crazy in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should see the penthouse,\u201d he said wryly, and her head swiveled to meet his gaze. She couldn\u2019t imagine the penthouse being anything other than immaculate.</p> <p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been at home a lot since it happened, and I didn\u2019t want to be disturbed, so I asked Esta not to come in.\u201d Esta was his cleaning lady.</p><p>\u201cYeah but you\u2019re inherently neat,\u201d she reminded him, and a corner of his mouth tilted up.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been myself these past two weeks,\u201d he said with a shoulder lift.</p><p>\u201cAnd work? You haven\u2019t been to the office much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have competent people to run things in my absence. I took compassionate leave.\u201d He unbuttoned his shirt and kicked off his shoes while he spoke, and Cleo turned her back to give him some privacy, while nervously rearranging the myriad decorative perfume atomizers on her dresser.</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d She wouldn\u2019t let the fact that he was stripping down affect her; she\u2019d invited him to stay, and he couldn\u2019t very well sleep in his shirt and trousers. It was ridiculous to be nervous around him; she\u2019d seen him in less. It wasn\u2019t like she didn\u2019t know what his body looked like. And being sexually aware of him was completely inappropriate and disrespectful considering the circumstances. \u201cYou can turn around again,\u201d he said, his wry tone making her wonder if he knew exactly what crazy thoughts had been running through her head. She turned around reluctantly and kept her eyes fixed on his face.</p><p>\u201cI can sleep in one of the guest rooms,\u201d he suggested gently. \u201cThere have to be more than a few in this gigantic house?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNone of them are currently habitable,\u201d she said, wrinkling her nose. \u201cWater damage in a couple from the leaky roof, mold in the other, and the last one is being used as a storage room for generations\u2019 worth of crap. We\u2019re talking everything from spindles to World War II rifles to old-time girlie magazines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not store those in the attic?\u201d he asked, but she didn\u2019t respond, waiting for him to figure it out instead.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, snapping his fingers. \u201cHoles in the ceiling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe roof leaks like a sieve, and naturally it\u2019s worse up in the attic, so Blue and Luc moved everything into the biggest guest room. Honestly, it\u2019s only a matter of time until it starts leaking in there as well.\u201d Talking about what a train wreck the house was calmed her nerves a bit, and she felt herself relaxing by degrees.</p><p>\u201cSo I suppose you\u2019re stuck with me tonight, then. Unless you want me to go home, after all?\u201d he asked, generously giving her the opportunity to back out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she whispered. \u201cLet\u2019s just go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, because I\u2019m exhausted, and I didn\u2019t relish the thought of the drive home.\u201d He crawled under the covers without further discussion and stretched out on his side. He eyed her with a slight smile playing about his lips and lifted the sheet invitingly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cleo returned the smile and slowly climbed in next to him. He sighed, the sound almost content, and brought the sheet and his arm down over her, cuddling her close. She turned onto her side so that she was spooned against him, and Dante pulled her tightly against his hard, beautiful body and tucked his arm around her waist. It was reminiscent of the way he\u2019d held her in the hospital the day they\u2019d lost Zach, and it was equally as tender as that particular gesture had been.</p><p>Cleo reached over and switched off the bedside lamp, and the room was plunged into darkness. The top of her head was tucked beneath his jaw, and their breathing was almost in tandem. At first they said nothing, both of them enjoying the warmth and company. The only sounds in the room were their soft breathing and the gentle rattle of the breeze against the loose pane of her window.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never done this snuggling thing before,\u201d he declared. His chest rumbled against her back, and his stubble tugged at her hair.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame,\u201d she whispered, hugging his arm to her chest. \u201cYou\u2019re a fantastic snuggler.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been a very good guy. Terrible with women,\u201d he whispered. The darkness of the room and the fact that she was facing away from him seemed to be enough to inspire this unexpected bout of honesty. \u201cI didn\u2019t want more than sex from them, maybe a short-lived affair here and there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, her voice dry. \u201cI was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I mean to settle down someday,\u201d he said, ignoring her sarcasm. He sounded driven to speak, and she was more than happy to let him air his thoughts. This whole turn of conversation took her mind off her immediate grief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you had a type picked out, right?\u201d she prompted, when it looked like he was done speaking.</p><p>\u201cI always thought I\u2019d marry a beautiful, elegant creature who would be the perfect wife and mother. We would have a quiet, calm marriage with mutual respect for each other. So much respect that the ugly concept of divorce would never once enter our minds. We would never argue, and we would have two children. A boy and a girl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould they be as boring as their mother, or as cowardly as their father?\u201d Cleo asked scathingly, and she felt his arm tense around her waist before it relaxed again.</p><p>\u201cProbably a mixture of both,\u201d he said, a hint of amusement in his voice.</p><p>\u201cBoring cowards,\u201d she said sympathetically. \u201cLuckily you\u2019re loaded, else they\u2019d have absolutely no friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why are you casting disparagement on my future wife and me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou want someone without personality,\u201d she said. \u201cA beautiful, empty vessel, into whom you would pour all your unrealistic expectations for the perfect marriage. The perfect Stepford wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQue?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a movie. Considering how much you hate horror films, it doesn\u2019t surprise me that you\u2019ve never seen it. It\u2019s about a bunch of guys who turn their wives into these perfect housewives. They all think the same and act the same. But never mind that. The point is, she\u2019d never challenge you, and you\u2019d be bored with her in months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m a coward, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t want to be challenged. You\u2019re terrified that a woman with any personality will mess up your perfect, orderly life and that you wouldn\u2019t be able to deal, and then the fighting would start and the irritation with each other and then the inevitable divorce. Just like your dad, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI refuse to wind up like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, your dad\u2019s an idiot.\u201d Cleo wasn\u2019t in the mood to pull any punches tonight.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more,\u201d he said, his voice wobbling a little. \u201cBut I know why I think he\u2019s an idiot, so I\u2019m interested in hearing your view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s clearly an appalling judge of character, and he never seems to learn from his past mistakes. Sound about right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed.\u201d</p> <p>She patted his arm smartly.</p><p>\u201cGood talk,\u201d she said, and this time he actually chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI like you a lot, Cleo,\u201d he said, the words sounding impulsive. \u201cYou make me laugh more than anyone else ever has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, how . . .\u201d She paused to think of the word. Unexpected. \u201cNice of you to say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if Zach would have had your sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about him,\u201d she said, clamming up at the sound of his name.</p><p>He squeezed her briefly in apology and dropped it. The conversation died after that, and Cleo listened to his breathing even out and become deeper. His arm grew heavy around her waist, and after a while, the comforting weight of that arm and the soft little snore that came with every third breath he took lulled her into a deep sleep.</p><p>When Cleo woke the next morning, it was to the same bleak reality that she\u2019d woken up to over the last fortnight, but this time the knowledge didn\u2019t physically weigh her down as much as it had just yesterday. She turned over and stared into Dante\u2019s relaxed face. He was still fast asleep, and as she really looked at him for the first time in two weeks, she saw that he appeared exhausted and definitely thinner. He had lost weight and had gained a few lines on his face. It was clear that this loss had taken a physical toll on him as well. At least his bruises from the accident had disappeared; there was only the very faintest tinge of yellow left around his eye.</p><p>She watched as his breathing became shallow and his eyes started to flutter beneath their lids, and when they opened, she kept her gaze level. She watched confusion flicker in his eyes for a second, followed by what could only be described as radiant joy, which flared and disappeared so quickly that she wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d imagined it or not. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMorning,\u201d she murmured, and then wrinkled her nose and covered her mouth. He grinned in delight at the gesture.</p><p>\u201cCome on, morning breath isn\u2019t cute,\u201d she protested. He leaned over and dropped a kiss on the back of the hand covering her mouth.</p><p>\u201cBuenos d\u00edas, dulzura,\u201d he said, his voice rasping sexily. \u201cHow did you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a log,\u201d she said, still from behind the hand. He stretched with a groan and smiled at her contentedly. God, he looked so beautiful in the morning, with that stubble, the slightly crooked grin, and his hard, ripped chest uncovered. She tried\u2014and failed\u2014to avert her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cMe too. Best sleep I\u2019ve had since it happened.\u201d His gorgeous smile dimmed somewhat at the reminder.</p><p>He got out of bed and stretched again, arms up over his head, with a massive yawn. Cleo blushed at the sight of all that toned, gorgeous flesh and at the obvious morning erection straining at the front of his white boxer briefs. The underwear left very little to the imagination. He noticed her fixed stare and glanced down at himself.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d he shrugged. \u201cMorning wood. Although waking up next to you has definitely made it more impressive than usual.\u201d</p><p>It reminded her of Tokyo and how comfortable he had been with his own nudity.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting out of those pajamas today,\u201d he mandated. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDante,\u201d she murmured miserably. She really didn\u2019t want to be among crowds of happy people when she felt like she was only half-alive.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, cielo,\u201d he implored, and she bit the inside of her cheek painfully as she considered his words.</p><p>\u201cPlease, I don\u2019t think I can be around people right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing like that,\u201d he said. \u201cJust us. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>To her surprise he took her to a yacht, the Arabella, which he proudly told Cleo was his. She recognized it from the photograph in his study.</p><p>\u201cThis is nice,\u201d she said as he helped her on board. She looked around, fascinated, and was reaching out to touch one of the intricate knots on the crossbar of the mast when Dante barked, \u201cStop!\u201d She jerked back her hand in fright.</p> <p>He took her hand and led her to a cushioned seat by the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cSit here and don\u2019t touch anything, okay? If I need your help, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d Bossy Dante was back. Great.</p><p>She pointedly folded her arms over her chest and stared back at him mutely. His lips quirked when he turned away from her and started untying rigging and doing the other mysterious and fascinating-looking things that boat people did. Because he hadn\u2019t brought a change of clothes with him last night, he was wearing a pair of Luc\u2019s faded old jeans, battered sneakers that her brother used for handiwork around the house, and a T-shirt that was a size too small for him. He looked scruffy and absolutely scrumptious, and it was hard for Cleo to focus on much else. While she had definitely learned to value many other aspects of Dante\u2019s character\u2014his warmth, his sense of humor, his kindness and thoughtfulness\u2014she still fully appreciated the packaging all that unexpected generosity of spirit was wrapped up in. The man was damned fine.</p><p>But she was soon distracted by his seeming skill around the boat. As with all things, he just looked supremely competent and confident. Cleo had never been on a boat before and had no idea how things worked. So in hindsight she should probably not have reached for that knot like a child who didn\u2019t know better. She might have broken his boat.</p><p>After he used the motor to steer them out of the harbor, he unfurled the sails and switched off the engine, leaving only the creaking sounds of the boat, the swish of water as they skimmed across the surface of the ocean, and the sound of the wind billowing in the white sails.</p><p>It was magnificent. Absolutely and unutterably peaceful.</p><p>\u201cGot your sea legs yet?\u201d he asked after about half an hour of not a single word exchanged between them. The silence had been enjoyable and comfortable. Cleo, who was still sitting where he\u2019d left her, looked up, not sure what to make of the question.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know. I\u2019ve just been sitting here, very industriously not touching anything,\u201d she said pointedly, and he chuckled.</p> <p>\u201cSince you usually do your own thing, I had to speak a bit sharply to ensure you understood that I meant business this time,\u201d he said, and she gasped, clutching a hand to her chest.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, are you kind of, almost, sort of apologizing to me?\u201d She squealed, and he very uncharacteristically rolled his eyes. A habit he may have picked up from her.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d he acquiesced. \u201cKind of. Almost. Sort of. I\u2019m still trying to work my way through that list of yours.\u201d</p><p>She laughed merrily and then immediately sobered.</p><p>\u201cCleo, it\u2019s okay to laugh,\u201d Dante said gruffly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be happy. There is no right or wrong way for you to deal with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you know this?\u201d Since when had he become an expert grief counselor?</p><p>\u201cWhen I went back to the hospital the next day and found you gone.\u201d His voice broke slightly on that last word, and his eyes darkened. \u201cI immediately went to Luc\u2019s place to fetch you. Luc and I had a long conversation.\u201d That was news to her. Luc had never told her about it.</p><p>\u201cHe convinced me to give you space, and even though it went against my every instinct to walk out of that house without you, I thought it might be best. I told myself not to be selfish, that even though I needed you, I had to do what was right for you, not for me. So I left. But . . . I couldn\u2019t go back to the apartment alone. I couldn\u2019t face that.\u201d He cleared his throat before continuing. \u201cThe hospital offered grief counseling, and I thought maybe it would help. So I went to talk to someone. And when you\u2019re ready . . . I think you should go as well. We could go together.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, her voice so soft she doubted he could hear her above the sound of the wind in the sails. Dante Damaso never failed to surprise her, and she wished he would stop because each new thing she learned about him made her love him more. How hard it was for a man like Dante to reveal his vulnerability, and yet he\u2019d done it often over the course of the last few weeks. She wanted to suppress her feelings for him, but it got harder and harder with every moment spent in his company.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to steer?\u201d he invited, quite deliberately changing the subject, and she was happy to let him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I wouldn\u2019t want to sink your precious boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWimp,\u201d he taunted, and she narrowed her eyes in mock outrage.</p> <p>\u201cOoh, you\u2019re going to pay for that one.\u201d She got up and walked over to the wheel on wobbly legs. It certainly wasn\u2019t very easy to walk on these boats.</p><p>He grinned and stepped aside to let her take the wheel. The boat immediately listed to the side, and she squealed. He chuckled and stepped up behind her, caging her with his body when his hands dropped on top of hers on the wheel. As usual, he smelled absolutely divine, and as his scent wrapped around her, she could barely concentrate on his instructions.</p><p>\u201cGot that?\u201d he asked, after a whole lot of gobbledygook that she hadn\u2019t been paying attention to, and stepped back. It was a sheer fluke that Cleo managed to keep the boat upright. And this time when she squealed, it was with excitement, and when she laughed, it was without guilt.</p><p>They spent a delightful afternoon on the boat, and Dante took her to dinner at a Mexican restaurant afterward. Cleo enjoyed herself, and the evening was relaxing and stress free. Their conversation centered around the hotel in Tokyo, the cute cards and paper flowers Cleo\u2019s dance-class students had made for her, and Luc and Blue\u2019s ramshackle old house. He was sweet and conscientious, and the one little sour point in the evening was when he asked her if she wanted a glass of wine and she refused, forgetting that she was no longer pregnant. Then the memory had hit her like a ton of bricks, the pain fresh and intense. It was seeing the same flash of pain in Dante\u2019s eyes that helped her get over it, knowing that she wasn\u2019t the only one feeling the loss. Being with somebody who understood what she was going through helped immeasurably.</p><p>On the drive home, he broached the subject of Zach again.</p> <p>\u201cWhat would you like to do with Zach\u2019s ashes?\u201d he asked quietly, and Cleo, who had been on the verge of dozing off after her two glasses of wine, was immediately wide-awake.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t thought about it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cCleo, we have to lay his soul to rest. We can\u2019t leave him in limbo like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready to think about it,\u201d she said stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you name him Zach?\u201d Dante asked.</p><p>\u201cI read on a few of the baby-name websites that the name meant remembrance or something similar. And I just want him to be remembered.\u201d She swiped at a stray tear that slipped down her cheek.</p> <p>\u201cAnd what made you decide to add Damaso to his name?\u201d His voice was quiet and filled with an emotion she couldn\u2019t quite place.</p><p>\u201cIt would have been wrong not to,\u201d she said simply, and he kept his eyes glued on the road.</p><p>\u201cThank you. It means a lot to me.\u201d</p><p>When he pulled into Luc\u2019s driveway, he turned to face her, his eyes gleaming in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cCleo, I know it\u2019s tough, and I want to do what\u2019s right for you . . . but I also want to do right by our son. I can\u2019t stand the thought of his ashes remaining there unclaimed. That is not how it should be; he was loved. I thought I could keep them until you\u2019re ready to make a decision, but they won\u2019t release the ashes to me. I\u2019ve tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe\u2014\u201d she started to say, and then hesitated, before swallowing loudly and plunging ahead. \u201cMaybe we should take him out on the Arabella and scatter his ashes at sea? It was so peaceful out there, so beautiful, and the view was lovely. I think it would be n-nice.\u201d</p><p>He reached out with one hand, hooking the back of her neck and tugging her toward him to plant a gentle kiss on her lips.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s an amazing idea,\u201d he whispered, his own voice wobbling with emotion.</p> <p>\u201cWill you come with me to . . . to pick up his ashes tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to stay again?\u201d she asked, hating the edge of neediness in her voice. He ran his thumb over her cheekbone, his eyes gleaming in the dark interior of the car.</p><p>\u201cMuch as I\u2019d love to, I don\u2019t think I can spend another day in your brother\u2019s too-tight clothes or wear his nasty shoes again. I need a change of clothes, dulzura. Would you like to come home with me instead?\u201d he asked gently. \u201cMost of your clothes are there, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019d prefer sleeping in your own bed, s\u00ed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Dante,\u201d she whispered, and his hand moved to cup her cheek.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I can go and fetch a bag and return here later.\u201d</p><p>She was tempted to say yes to that suggestion but didn\u2019t think it would be fair to ask him to make the half-hour drive to his penthouse at the Waterfront and back to Hout Bay again.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t ask you to do an hour of unnecessary driving,\u201d she said regretfully. \u201cIt\u2019s okay; you go home. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Picking up the ashes the following morning wasn\u2019t as much of an ordeal as Cleo expected. With Dante by her side, it was surprisingly easy. He took charge and was even thoughtful enough to bring a beautiful, ornate little urn along with him. They waited in an uncomfortable, sterile office while the worker took the urn away to transfer Zach\u2019s ashes into it. When he returned moments later, he handed it over with a sympathetic nod. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for your loss,\u201d he said somberly. Cleo couldn\u2019t contain the sob that escaped when she saw the urn and acknowledged what the contents were. Dante wrapped an arm around her and held her close, while the morgue worker discreetly left them alone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so stupid to be this . . . sad about the loss of someone who never really lived,\u201d she said, her voice muffled by his chest.</p><p>\u201cHe lived,\u201d Dante said firmly. \u201cHe lived inside you, and in a different way, he lived inside me. He lived in our hearts and in our heads; we saw him, we felt him. Don\u2019t ever say he never really lived, Cleo. He may not have had a life, but he lived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, for a guy who only ever said or did the wrong thing in the past, you\u2019re doing pretty great with the pep talks lately,\u201d she said, trying to sound a little more lighthearted even while she plucked a white handkerchief out of his breast pocket and blew her nose inelegantly. \u201cHow do you always manage to say the right thing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn this instance, I\u2019m not saying anything you don\u2019t already know.\u201d He stroked her hair back and kissed her sweetly.</p><p>She was getting used to his kisses, and it scared her because one day he wouldn\u2019t be around to give her any more. She dreaded the inevitability of that day.</p><p>They left the hospital hand in hand, Dante carrying Zach\u2019s ashes. When they reached the car, Cleo turned to him impulsively.</p><p>\u201cCould we . . . do you think we could do it today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d he asked. \u201cDon\u2019t you want your brother and Blue to be there too?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been amazing, but they don\u2019t understand, Dante. Not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019ll come to regret excluding them?\u201d</p><p>She thought about that and then sighed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she confessed miserably. \u201cMaybe I would.\u201d He squeezed her hand and lifted it to his mouth to plant a kiss on her knuckles.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it properly, okay? Would you like me to take care of the arrangements?\u201d She hesitated at his question, feeling horrible about letting him bear the brunt of the responsibility, but he stared down at her with those infinitely patient eyes, and she found herself nodding.</p><p>\u201cDo you want it to be a religious ceremony?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, something intimate but informal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Dante asked Cleo, Luc, and Blue to meet him at the Waterfront by seven thirty the following evening. He was waiting beside his berthed yacht, dressed all in white. Cleo was wearing a simple white summer shift dress, and Blue and Luc had also respected Dante\u2019s request that they wear white.</p><p>He helped them aboard and cast off after making sure everybody was comfortably seated. Naturally, Luc didn\u2019t remain down for long; he wandered over to pepper Dante with questions about the boat, and the two chatted amicably while Blue and Cleo sat down.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Blue asked, taking her hand.</p><p>\u201cIt helps to have you and Luc here,\u201d she said honestly, grateful to Dante for persuading her to include them. Her eyes drifted over to the big, handsome man who was talking to her brother. He was wearing a pair of expensive dark sunglasses, effectively shielding his emotions from all of them. But she knew exactly how he was feeling today.</p><p>\u201cIt helps to have him here too,\u201d Cleo admitted, nodding toward where the two men stood. Dante was casually winding some thick rope around his elbow and thumb.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known Dante for a few years now; he\u2019s visited the house on occasion for dinner or to hang out with Luc,\u201d Blue said unexpectedly.</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d Cleo prompted, curious to hear where this was going.</p><p>\u201cYes, and he was . . .\u201d Blue shook her head. \u201cVery different from this guy.\u201d</p><p>Cleo snorted, knowing exactly what Blue meant.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess.\u201d Cleo held up a hand to stop Blue from saying more. \u201cHe was bossy, arrogant, a little too self-assured, and a little too unconcerned with the world around him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds about right,\u201d Blue said with a smile. \u201cI could never fault his friendship with Luc, though. Classic bromance if ever there was one. You don\u2019t expect them to have much in common, and yet they can talk for hours. I think that\u2019s one of the reasons Luc reacted so strongly to the news that Dante was your baby\u2019s father. It felt like a betrayal. His best friend had disrespected his sister, and his sister had robbed him of his best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he doesn\u2019t have to worry about that anymore. After today, Dante and I will probably not be seeing much of each other again.\u201d She couldn\u2019t think of a single reason they should have any connection after this. Zach\u2019s remains were all that tied them together. Life would have to go back to normal, even if Cleo would never be the same.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Blue asked. \u201cYou guys are good for each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re helping each other get through this, Blue. After this, we have nothing tethering us to each other. We can move forward and carry on with our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you spoken to him about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll agree with me. He has to. It makes no sense to drag this out when there\u2019s nothing more between us.\u201d</p><p>The boat finally started moving, and Luc sat down on Cleo\u2019s other side and dropped an arm around her shoulder in casual affection, giving her a comforting squeeze.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, Pattypan,\u201d he said beneath his breath, and she gave him a small smile.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered, and dropped her head on his shoulder. She watched the Waterfront slide by and get left behind, watched the beautiful flat-topped Table Mountain recede and become flatter and flatter the farther out they went. The view was breathtaking. Once they were far enough away from other boats to be alone, Dante switched off the engines. He didn\u2019t unfurl the sails but pulled a lever that he\u2019d told her the other day was the anchor release. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stared off into the distance, the orange orb of the setting sun reflected in his sunglasses. He took a deep breath, and the lowered angle of his head told Cleo that he\u2019d shifted his focus to her. He stepped away from the wheel and held out his hand to her, and she took it without hesitation, getting up to join him.</p><p>\u201cLook at that,\u201d he said, pointing out at the horizon and the huge, shimmering globe of the sun as it sank silently into the ocean. He wrapped his arms around her waist from behind, resting his chin on her shoulder and tugging her back until she could feel his hard warmth against her. His next words were spoken directly into her ear. \u201cI want you to always remember the beauty of this sunset when you think of Zach, dulzura. Can you do that for me?\u201d</p><p>Tears flooded into her eyes, and she gulped back a sob as she nodded mutely.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He seemed to silently communicate something to Luc, who got up and went into the cabin. He emerged moments later with the urn in his hands. He came up to stand on their left, while Blue moved to their right.</p> <p>\u201cCleo, you have to be prepared . . . there\u2019s not much in there. He was so tiny.\u201d This time her sob couldn\u2019t be swallowed back, and he gave her a squeeze when he heard the sound.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d he asked as the sun disappeared completely, leaving only a bright-orange-and-scarlet sky in its wake, making the ocean look like it was on fire.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He released his hold on her and took the urn from Luc.</p><p>\u201cWe do this together? Okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to say something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her response was so faint she wasn\u2019t sure if he heard her, so she straightened her shoulders and found her voice. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She put her hands below his on the urn, and he adjusted his grip until his hands were on top of hers.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re ready,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYou will . . . ,\u201d she began, but the words felt too big and obstructive to squeeze past her swollen vocal cords. She cleared her throat and tried again. \u201cYou will always be in my heart, Zach. I will love and cherish you till the end of time.\u201d The last word was so badly mangled that it actually made her wince. Dante kissed her cheek sweetly and then returned his attention to the vessel in their hands.</p> <p>\u201cTe amo, hijito. Te amo,\u201d he muttered, before lifting one of his hands from hers to take the lid off the urn and hand it to Luc. Once he had his hands over hers again, he looked at her, and this close to him she could see the faint quiver of his lips and, most tellingly, the line of moisture trickling down his cheek from behind his glasses.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d she asked him, recognizing that nobody had asked him that question since they\u2019d boarded the boat. His lips quirked slightly in acknowledgment of her consideration, and he inclined his head.</p><p>They both took a huge gulp of air, and together they upended the urn and watched as the meager contents poured into the water below. A minute portion was taken by the wind and scattered toward the distant city.</p><p>Blue and Luc scattered white rose petals into the water to mix with the ashes, and they all watched as the petals drifted away from the boat. The ash, being heavier, sank almost immediately. Cleo felt . . . hollow but at peace, grateful for the support of these three people who meant so much to her, and happy to have the opportunity to offer the same support to this man she loved with her entire being.</p><p>They all silently watched the petals drift farther and farther away, and after half an hour, when it was almost completely dark, Dante started preparing to take them back to shore. As the boat started back up, the powerful purr of the engine shattered the silence around them, and Cleo felt a moment\u2019s panic at leaving. But as the boat stirred up water in its wake, something absolutely astonishing happened, and she cried out at the beauty of it. Dante left Luc at the helm and came leaping over at her startled cry, but he paused when they saw what had caught Cleo\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d Cleo whispered in awe. The stirred-up water in the wake of the boat was a sparkling electric blue, creating an otherworldly glowing path back to where they\u2019d left Zach. It was perfect, and even though Cleo knew it was ocean phosphorescence, it couldn\u2019t have happened at a better time or had a more magical impact.</p><p>She felt a strong and familiar arm creep around her shoulder, and she leaned into Dante as they both watched the shimmering wake stream behind them.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like a path to heaven,\u201d she said, and then turned to look at him before hugging him fiercely. \u201cThank you for this, Dante. It\u2019s perfect. So beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy pleasure, dulzura,\u201d he said, returning her hug. She took a deep breath and inhaled his wonderful scent one last time before stepping away from him.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>Christmas would have been a lot grimmer if not for Blue and Luc inviting him over for the day. It had been almost two weeks since Cleo had simply upped and left with nothing but an unsatisfactory note of \u201cexplanation\u201d for Dante.</p><p>He was pissed off and worried about her. He couldn\u2019t understand why she\u2019d just gone without a warning or good-bye. It had felt like a kick to the gut, especially since she\u2019d flown out the day after they\u2019d scattered Zach\u2019s ashes. Dante felt a little used and a lot hurt. Only Cleo had the ability to make him feel such contrary and powerful emotions.</p><p>He, of course, knew exactly where she was, despite the fact that she\u2019d kept that information from Luc and Blue just to avoid the possibility of them telling him. But all he\u2019d really needed to know was that she was with Callum Faris, and his resources had done the rest. He had known where she was since two days after she left. But he kept waiting for her to call. Only she never did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDante?\u201d Blue\u2019s voice prompted him, her eyes concerned. \u201cDo you want another slice of roast beef?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d he said, taking a sip of red wine. He\u2019d been drinking way too much since she\u2019d left, and he didn\u2019t want to become that guy, the fool who turned to alcohol whenever things didn\u2019t go his way. Still, it was damned satisfying to get rip-roaring drunk every night. At least he didn\u2019t have to face his cold and empty apartment sober.</p><p>He was starting to hate that place more and more. Cleo had turned it into a home while she had lived there, and he resented not having that home anymore. He missed her companionship, those movie nights with those awful films she got such a kick out of making him watch. He longed for the dinners they\u2019d shared and the conversations they\u2019d had. He had loved cooking for her. Once his greatest passion, it had become a lackluster affair now that he prepared meals for only himself. And even though it had driven him crazy sometimes, he even missed tripping over the stuff she used to leave lying around the place. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to work out in his gym anymore and used the one at the office instead, because it physically hurt to stare at that dance floor and not see her doing her barre routines there. And crazy though it seemed, he even missed having her finish his sentences</p><p>\u201cWhen did you hear last from Cleo?\u201d he asked Luc, and watched his friend tense.</p> <p>\u201cThis morning. She called with Christmas greetings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she alone today?\u201d The thought of her being alone at Christmas bugged him, but then he told himself that she didn\u2019t have to be alone. She could be here with people who cared about her.</p><p>\u201cCal\u2019s there. They\u2019re attempting their own version of a roast lunch.\u201d</p><p>Dante grimaced at that news.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll poison themselves,\u201d he grunted, shaking his head. \u201cEspecially if Cleo does the cooking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s a pretty awful cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she happy?\u201d Dante hated asking, but he needed to know, and Luc shifted uncomfortably in his seat.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not unhappy, and for now I think that\u2019s all we can hope for.\u201d</p><p>A month after leaving Cape Town, Cleo was starting to feel like she had a handle on her life again. Just a couple of days after arriving in Durban, she\u2019d gone to a local dance studio and informed them they\u2019d be idiots not to enlist her to teach a few ballet classes. Cal and a few of her former colleagues had vouched for her. She loved teaching and had fledgling dreams of opening her own dance school. She finally felt like she had a purpose again. She also choreographed dance pieces in her spare time, sometimes inspired by a song or a piece of art or even a bird in flight. It was wonderful and stimulating. She was developing quite a portfolio but didn\u2019t know if she would ever be brave enough to pitch those ideas to any dance companies.</p><p>It was close to five in the evening, and she was just getting home to the apartment she shared with Cal after one of her new junior dance classes. She had her head down and was fumbling with her keys when she walked straight into something huge, warm, and solid just outside of the apartment door.</p><p>\u201cYou really need to start looking where you\u2019re going, dulzura,\u201d chastised the last voice she had ever expected to hear again. She dropped her keys, her head flying up in reaction to that voice. She was filled with such raw, unbridled joy at the sight of him that her knees could barely hold her upright.</p> <p>\u201cWell?\u201d he prompted in that dulcet voice. \u201cDo you have anything to say to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked shakily. He snorted and shook his head in disgust before bending down to retrieve her keys.</p><p>\u201cI think the more accurate question is, what the hell are you doing here?\u201d He unlocked the door and steered her inside before following her in and slamming the door behind them.</p><p>\u201cI live here,\u201d she replied defiantly.</p><p>\u201cNo, you live with me,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cYou never moved out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seem to recall moving out after I lost our baby,\u201d she said pointedly.</p><p>\u201cThat was always going to be a temporary thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that? I was only living there because I was pregnant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCleo, tell me what the hell happened? We had Zach\u2019s memorial, we said good-bye at the Waterfront, I told you I\u2019d see you the next day, and you just left! How could you do that?\u201d</p><p>She had boarded the first plane out of Cape Town the next morning, telling Luc and Blue only that she would be living with Cal, but not telling them exactly where that was, because she didn\u2019t want to put them in the position of lying to Dante. They\u2019d protested, of course, said that she was making a mistake, and begged her to stay for Christmas. But Cleo hadn\u2019t been able to face the holidays and had firmly believed that she needed to get out of the city and as far away from Dante as possible in order to cut him out of her life completely.</p><p>\u201cI left you a note,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cWhich said absolutely nothing. \u2018Thank you for everything you\u2019ve done. I cannot express how much it has meant to me but I think we both deserve a fresh start\u2019?\u201d He sounded incredulous, but Cleo was more shocked that he could recite her note verbatim. \u201cWhat the hell was that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt meant exactly what it said, Dante. Everything that tied us together is gone, and there is no need for us to be in each other\u2019s lives anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d he growled. \u201cThere is every reason!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to stick around because you felt guilty or whatever. I wanted you to go on with your life, and I tried to pick up the pieces of mine. It\u2019s for the best. There\u2019s just no reason for us to ever see each other again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop saying that!\u201d he snapped. \u201cNo reason for us to ever see each other again? Well, what about this?\u201d He framed her face and planted an angry, bruising kiss on her lips, and she was so shocked at first that she didn\u2019t react, but when the shock wore off and she started to struggle against his hold, his kiss gentled. His mouth opened and his tongue traced the seam of her lips. It was an invitation she couldn\u2019t resist . . . not when she\u2019d spent the last month missing him every single hour of every day. She welcomed him in, and he groaned, the sound smothered against her mouth. He deepened his kiss, taking just that little bit more before ending it and stepping away from her, leaving her reeling.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s that,\u201d he said triumphantly, pointing a finger at her, and she shook her head to clear her befuddled senses.</p><p>\u201cWe know we have chemistry,\u201d she said. Her tongue flicked out to taste him on her lips, and he groaned at the gesture. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably always have chemistry, but let\u2019s face it, that\u2019s all we ever had, all we\u2019ll ever have. It\u2019s not enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting sick of you leaving me, Cleo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t leave you, Dante.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have to be so damned unreasonable?\u201d It was a familiar refrain, one she had heard from him in various forms of exasperation before. \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t even know why I bother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either,\u201d she said, her absolute confusion showing in her face and in her voice.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re living with Callum again?\u201d he asked, changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just temporary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd how have you been? After everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cSome days are harder than others, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I know. I got a call from that baby-furniture store the other day.\u201d His eyes took on a shimmer. \u201cI forgot to cancel the order, and they wanted to know . . . to know when I wanted them to deliver it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d Her hands flew to her mouth as she imagined how awful that must have been.</p><p>\u201cThat was one of the bad days. I left work early and went home and wished to hell I could talk to you about it! Only you weren\u2019t around, and I got sick of giving you time to come to your senses, so I came to fetch you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, are you saying you knew where I was?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDulzura, please, you forget that I am Dante Damaso. I have wealth, power, and influence at my fingertips.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, old habits surfacing in his presence.</p><p>\u201cAlso ego,\u201d she added. He sent her a quelling glance before continuing.</p><p>\u201cI knew you were with Callum. It was just a matter of finding out which company he danced for, and there aren\u2019t many options in Durban. Once I figured that out, a quick phone call told me exactly where he was staying. I\u2019ve known since almost the beginning. But I wanted to give you time to figure this out by yourself. Then I got sick of giving you time, because I missed you like hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent Christmas with your brother and Blue,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause they felt sorry for my pathetic ass. I was always calling them and asking if they\u2019d heard from you and wanting to know if you were okay.\u201d</p><p>Cleo knew that; Blue and Luc had both told her stories of how Dante kept questioning them about her well-being. She had thought it was just polite concern, but looking at him now, she could see it was far from that.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Cleo! You gave me a home and family, and then you just took it away from me,\u201d he hissed. \u201cWe lost Zach; we didn\u2019t have to lose each other too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, back up a second,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re making no sense, Dante. Before I lost the baby, we had an arrangement. I\u2019d move out with Zach and set up house in an apartment you provided, and you would play the role of his glorified uncle or something. That was the extent of our relationship. We were living together for convenience, and you never once hinted at anything different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you to marry me,\u201d he reminded her, his nostrils flaring with irritation.</p><p>\u201cBecause you wanted Zach!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, you idiot.\u201d He was practically yelling now, and she blinked at the spectacular emotional explosion she was witnessing from the famously cool Dante Damaso. This was just . . . fascinating. \u201cBecause I wanted you!\u201d</p><p>She stumbled backward and sat down on the hard couch with a thump. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and sank down on the couch next to her. \u201cI mean, of course I wanted the baby, but I wanted you too. No, let me rephrase, I wanted you especially.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not great at talking about things like this,\u201d he said with a wince, keeping his gaze straight ahead while she kept hers fixed on his stark profile.</p><p>\u201cGive it a go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we first slept together in Tokyo, that was just sex, but I couldn\u2019t stay away from you for the entirety of that trip, despite trying my damnedest to leave you alone every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t seem to try very hard.\u201d She sniffed.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re wrong. I tried exceptionally hard, and yet every night we just wound up in bed together. Maybe I should have known then, but I wouldn\u2019t see it. I told myself I just needed to get you out of my system; we had some crazy chemistry, and it would eventually fade. Only it didn\u2019t. It got worse. I mean we had sex on my desk! On my desk.\u201d He sounded mildly astonished by that fact. \u201cI stepped over a line that day, and I didn\u2019t even care. I transferred you out of my office and figured that was that. But it wasn\u2019t. Every day, Cleo. I thought about you every bloody day.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell . . .\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure how to respond to that. He was now facing her, his eyes glowing with a powerful emotion.</p><p>\u201cThen you came to my office and told me you were pregnant. And with all the confusion that followed, with the craziness, the disbelief and doubt and all those hurtful, angry words we exchanged, I just never . . . I never saw it. I didn\u2019t recognize you.\u201d He sounded completely confused, and Cleo shook her head, not understanding.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know who you were.\u201d His voice bordered on desperate, and the intensity in his eyes deepened as he struggled to verbalize his emotion. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said regretfully. She wished she did, because she sensed that this meant a lot to him, and his inability to explain it was frustrating to both of them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dante; I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He glanced upward as if seeking answers from the heavens and then brought his gaze back down to hers.</p><p>\u201cWhen we first met, I saw a pretty woman. One who immediately set off my internal alarms. \u2018Instant dislike,\u2019 I told myself. \u2018Stay away from her; she\u2019ll annoy the ever-loving hell out of you!\u2019 But I couldn\u2019t stay away. Before Tokyo you were in my space day in and day out. I kept farming you out to other people just so that I could get some work done. Because you did annoy me, aggravate me, shatter my concentration, and you made me feel damned uncomfortable in my own skin! I couldn\u2019t wait to get rid of you, even while I couldn\u2019t seem to stay away from you. But back then I didn\u2019t know who you were, not even after we made love.\u201d</p><p>Made love? What had happened to his other\u2014cruder\u2014term for it?</p><p>\u201cEven after that, I didn\u2019t recognize you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDante, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d And she desperately wanted to understand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re it, Cleo,\u201d he snapped, clearly annoyed with himself for losing his grasp on the English language so completely. \u201cYou\u2019re her. You\u2019re my she. My other. Mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she whispered in disbelief. Even with his incoherence and his accent thickening on every syllable, Cleo was starting to understand. And what she thought she understood was utterly unbelievable.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine. The one who was put on this earth for me. And I\u2019m so damned sorry I didn\u2019t recognize you immediately. I was stupidly prepared to let you walk out of my life forever, but fate stepped in and gave us Zach,\u201d he said, his voice breaking as he dashed at the tears in his eyes. \u201cAnd Zach gave me a chance to see and finally recognize you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDante,\u201d she said, her voice wobbling slightly, \u201ctake a deep breath and tell me in easy English so that I know I\u2019m not going out of my mind here. What are you trying to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to say that I\u2019m an idiot! A blind fool. And that I already lost Zach, and I don\u2019t want to lose you too. Because my life is shit without you! I\u2019m saying that I adore you. I revere you. I cherish you. I fucking love you, Cleo.\u201d</p> <p>Her hands flew up to her mouth to stifle her gasp, and she simply stared at him in shock.</p><p>\u201cI love you and you keep leaving me,\u201d he said angrily.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like I knew you loved me,\u201d she said logically, and he glared at her.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019ve been an asshole,\u201d he said, his voice earnest. \u201cAnd that it\u2019s probably hard to imagine yourself ever caring for me or loving me, but I\u2019m trying to change and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDante,\u201d she interrupted him firmly, \u201clet\u2019s get two things straight. You haven\u2019t been an asshole for a very, very long time. But I couldn\u2019t trust you with my heart because I thought all you wanted was the baby, and I didn\u2019t want a marriage like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you trust me with your heart now?\u201d he asked tentatively, one finger reaching out to stroke the back of her hand in a feather-light touch.</p><p>\u201cThat was the second thing. It\u2019s pretty easy for me to imagine myself in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed?\u201d he asked, hope blooming in his dark eyes.</p> <p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>He edged closer, crowding her back against the sofa and twisting until his hands were braced on the back of the sofa and his torso was hovering above hers.</p><p>\u201cCare to elaborate on that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve been the asshole,\u201d she said, and he made a protesting sound. \u201cEven after you showed me what a good guy you could be, starting with your immediate refusal to allow me to pay for my own medical bills, right up until Zach\u2019s farewell, I still doubted that you could really care for me. Now maybe that\u2019s just me lacking a whole lot of self-confidence, but it\u2019s also in part because I never really believed in you. And I\u2019m so sorry, Dante.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry too,\u201d he whispered against her lips. \u201cI didn\u2019t give you much reason to trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, now what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cA couple of things,\u201d he said, digging into his jacket pocket and tugging out a long black jeweler\u2019s box. \u201cYour Christmas present.\u201d</p><p>She took the box from him and held it in her hands, a little overwhelmed by everything that was happening. A Christmas present. How did she always keep underestimating him, despite all the evidence pointing to the fact that he was a good man? Cleo had never felt more foolish or more humble than she did in that moment.</p><p>\u201cOpen it,\u201d he urged, and she cracked the box open and gasped when she saw what was nestled inside. It was a tiny, heart-shaped gold pendant, with a minute off-center diamond catching the light. The pendant hung from a delicate chain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely,\u201d she said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to feel about this, but it seemed like the right thing to do at the time,\u201d he said quietly, and she peered up at him curiously.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI removed a small portion of Zach\u2019s ashes from his urn the night before we scattered them and had this pendant made for you. I thought that maybe after you\u2019ve had time to think about it, you\u2019d like the idea of carrying part of him close to your heart at all times.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you saying the ashes are in here?\u201d she asked in disbelief. The heart looked boxy but absolutely seamless except for the small holes running through the top for the chain. As she inspected it, she noticed the curling script on the back of the pendant.</p><p>\u201cThey, uh . . . they seal it after they place the ashes inside. There\u2019s a little indentation close to the bottom of the heart where they inserted the ashes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Dante!\u201d she cried, not really hearing his nervous words, as she read the script. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Zach, remembered forever.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind?\u201d he asked, and she flung her arms around his waist and hugged him close.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t mind,\u201d she said as she put the beautiful pendant on, turning slightly for him to fasten it for her. \u201cIt means so much. Just so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have one too.\u201d He tugged on a leather cord around his neck and dragged out an infinitely more masculine silver hoop. It wasn\u2019t very big, and again she couldn\u2019t see how it could possibly contain the ashes, but it was beautiful and had the same sentiment engraved on the outer loop.</p><p>\u201cAnd the . . . the second thing.\u201d He sounded really nervous, and she leaned back, her joy at the gift momentarily forgotten as she stared at him in fascination. He fumbled around in his jacket pockets again and this time produced a square box.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m going to ask you again. I\u2019ve asked you a million times already, Cleo, and I\u2019m probably not asking again after this. Probably. So you\u2019d better consider my question carefully.\u201d He was rambling, and Cleo could only stare at him with what she knew was a besotted grin on her face. She had never really seen him this nervous before, and it was absolutely adorable. A word she wouldn\u2019t previously have associated with Dante Damaso. He smoothed down his hair, straightened his tie, and then, quite unexpectedly, dropped to one knee in front of her.</p><p>\u201cSo, Cleopatra Pandora Knight . . .\u201d She winced at the use of her full name. \u201cWill you marry me? Because like I said before, my life is shit without you, and I love the hell out of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou going to show me the ring, champ?\u201d she asked pointedly. \u201cMy answer may well hinge on the size of the rock you got me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMercenary woman,\u201d he said without heat. He flipped open the box, and Cleo gasped.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she said reverently. It was a deep square-cut emerald bordered by smaller diamonds.</p><p>\u201cIt matches your eyes almost exactly,\u201d he said, removing the ring from its velvet cushion.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d she said, feeling completely overwhelmed by the depth of her feeling for him.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I must,\u201d she said, striving for casual even though her eyes were heavy with tears. She held out her hand, and he kissed her ring finger before sliding the ring onto it.</p><p>\u201cNo more running away from me, Cleo,\u201d he warned. \u201cTalk to me next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left because I loved you so much,\u201d she said seriously, and he cupped her face in the palms of his hands.</p> <p>\u201cNext time stay because I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be a next time, Dante.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I ask for.\u201d He kissed her deeply, and by the time he ended the kiss, she was straddling his lap, his tie was undone, and his shirt was unbuttoned halfway down his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d she said, and leaned in for another drugging kiss, which he happily reciprocated, his hands cupping her butt. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I left. The first time you proposed, I thought you wanted to marry me because of Zach, and I never wanted you to feel trapped or obligated to marry. After he died, I thought we were just helping each other cope with the grief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more talk. I\u2019ve missed more than your weird sense of humor and your appalling taste in movies, you know,\u201d he said seriously.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, I\u2019ve missed tasting this mouth,\u201d he growled, before leaning up to do just that. It wasn\u2019t nearly long enough or satisfying enough. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve missed this highly cuppable little bum.\u201d Again, action to match his words. Cleo squirmed with excitement and wondered where he was going next. \u201cOh God, and these sensitive little beauties have haunted my dreams.\u201d Her breath quickened in anticipation, and she wriggled on his lap, excited for what was to come. \u201cMy mouth has been empty without them to . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hello.\u201d The masculine voice coming from such close proximity shocked the hell out of both of them. Cleo squealed and tried to jump off Dante\u2019s lap, but his palms flattened against her hips and kept her in place.</p><p>\u201cYou stay right there. At least until after I\u2019ve managed to lose the hard-on,\u201d he warned under his breath, and she collapsed against his chest in a fit of giggles, hiding her face from Cal, whom neither of them had heard come home.</p><p>\u201cNice to see you again, Mr. D,\u201d Cal said in a voice that sounded wholly insincere. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou might as well call me Dante, since you\u2019ll be seeing so much more of me in the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why would that be?\u201d Cal asked.</p><p>Keeping her face buried in Dante\u2019s chest, not so much because of embarrassment but because it smelled so wonderful there, Cleo held up her left hand for Cal\u2019s inspection.</p><p>He gasped and grabbed her hand.</p> <p>\u201cNow that\u2019s a serious rock,\u201d Cal said. \u201c\u2019Bout time you made an honest woman out of her.\u201d His tone changed, going deeper and more serious. \u201cI wanted to tell you I was sorry to hear about the baby. It just about broke my heart. You have my sympathies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Callum,\u201d Dante said sincerely. \u201cThat means a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, look . . . this is a onetime deal. I\u2019m gonna take some clothes and head over to a friend\u2019s and stay the night. Knock yourselves out, but do not, for the love of God, have sex on my bed!\u201d</p><p>Cleo sniggered, and after an experimental wiggle, figured it was safe to climb off Dante\u2019s lap. She launched herself at Cal and hugged him fiercely.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cFor everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnytime, hon. Anytime.\u201d</p><p>A couple of hours later, sated and exhausted, Dante and Cleo lounged on the sleeper couch, completely naked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never made love on a sleeper couch before,\u201d he said bemusedly, and Cleo giggled. She felt absurdly happy.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called slumming it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, we could have gone to the Damaso International Hotel on the Golden Mile,\u201d he said, referencing Durban\u2019s famous beach strip. \u201cBut the thought never even occurred to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo . . . some stuff to talk about,\u201d she said, toying with his pendant as she sat on his lap.</p> <p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He looked and sounded exhausted.</p><p>\u201cI hate that penthouse; we\u2019re getting a real house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBossy,\u201d he said on a yawn.</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re having a proper wedding with a big white dress and a tux and everything, but you\u2019re paying for it because I\u2019m totally poor.\u201d He snorted as his hands roamed absently up and down her slender back.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re honeymooning in Japan,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd going to each and every page marked off in your travel guide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know about that?\u201d she asked, stunned. As far she knew, he\u2019d never even noticed her guide.</p><p>\u201cPlease, you were poring over that thing every time we were in the car with Daisuke, asking him questions about places that interested you in the book. Most evenings, I had Daisuke drive by some of those places so that, even though we didn\u2019t have the time to properly visit them, you could have a sense of what they were like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered if that was your doing,\u201d she said. It had been a kind and considerate gesture, to say the least.</p> <p>\u201cI also happened to leaf through the book one day while you were in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSneaky,\u201d she tut-tutted.</p><p>\u201cHey, it was just lying there, in full view at the top of your handbag,\u201d he joked.</p><p>\u201cI also wanted to discuss children,\u201d she said, and he went still, obviously bracing himself for something. \u201cI\u2019d like to hold off on another baby for a couple of years, if that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine with me, dulzura. I get to have you all to myself for a while.\u201d He looked so relieved by her comment that she was curious.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you expecting me to say?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI was concerned that maybe you never wanted another one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have done if that were the case?\u201d</p><p>He considered her question carefully.</p><p>\u201cI would have left you to think it over a little longer, and in a few years\u2019 time I would have asked you to reconsider. If you were still adamantly against it, I would have tried steering you toward adoption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have minded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have minded very much, but your happiness is my happiness,\u201d he said simply, and she cupped his stubbled jaw between the palms of her hands and kissed him.</p><p>\u201cI also want you to draw up a prenuptial contract,\u201d she said quietly, and he went still beneath her. Every muscle in his body froze.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not your father, Dante, so don\u2019t be stupid. Draw up the contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m happy to share everything I have with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s fabulous, but I want you to approach this union as you would have approached marriage to your boring dream woman. Draw up a contract that you know we\u2019ll never use because we love and respect each other too much for the ugly notion of divorce to ever enter our heads. Do it for me. Make sure I don\u2019t take you for every penny you own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a weird and wonderful woman, Cleopatra Knight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I wish you\u2019d stop calling me that! And don\u2019t you ever use my middle name again, Dante Aloysius Damaso,\u201d she said, and he scowled. \u201cRemember, I can dish the dirt too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some rules for you too,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty simple. You allow me to finance a studio for you so that you can start teaching on a more serious basis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s . . .\u201d He held up his forefinger and tilted his head.</p><p>\u201cShush. I\u2019m not done talking yet. You always share a workout space with me, because you\u2019re seriously sexy when you\u2019re doing that whole ballerina thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you when you\u2019re doing the boxing thing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOnce we get a house, we\u2019re getting a dog.

Dante stepped into her line of sight, and she gave him a perturbed frown in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cThis kid is making me fat,\u201d she pouted, and he grinned, coming up behind her to wrap his arms around her. He could barely fit them around her huge stomach.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful and you know it,\u201d he told her, dropping a kiss onto her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cEverybody\u2019s here,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou ready for this?\u201d</p><p>She covered his hands with hers and looked at the picture they presented in the mirror. Both were wearing white\u2014Dante, a simple shirt-and-trouser combination that looked devastating on his lean form, and Cleo, a pretty maternity sundress with shoulder ties.</p> <p>Every year on the anniversary of his birth and death, they celebrated the life of the son who had brought them together. During their first two years of marriage, they\u2019d gone out on the Arabella to the same spot where they\u2019d scattered his ashes and watched the sunset. They never saw the phosphorescence again, and that made the memory of it so much more special to Cleo.</p><p>On the third anniversary they changed things up a bit as their daughter, Tamara, had been only a couple of months old, so they commemorated the day differently, planting an oak tree in their garden instead. Afterward, they worked together for months to create a beautiful little remembrance garden around the tree. Dante had a stone bench placed in the garden, and they would often sit there together, or sometimes alone, and think about their lost baby. He also commissioned a discreet engraved memorial stone to be placed at the base of the tree, and like their pendants, it simply read</p><p>ZACH, REMEMBERED FOREVER.</p><p>After that, they started having the anniversary in the garden and included Blue and Luc, Cal and Tami. And this year, Enrique Damaso, who was between wives at the moment, had joined them too. A doting grandpapa, Enrique visited and Skyped regularly, but he had never been there for Zach\u2019s memorial before.</p><p>The day had become one of celebration as they remembered their baby with joy rather than sorrow. And sometimes in the privacy of their bedroom, when it was just the two of them, they would wonder aloud what he would have been like.</p><p>Dante\u2019s hand moved up to toy with her pendant.</p><p>\u201cCal is trying to convince Luc that he\u2019s the better braai master, and the two will be having some kind of cook-off later. As if I\u2019d let either of them anywhere near my grill,\u201d he snorted, the corner of his eyes crinkling attractively. The man just got more gorgeous with age; the sprinkling of gray in his hair and the fine lines forming around his eyes and on his brow just added to his disgusting good looks. It was something she often complained about, protesting the fact that she was getting a bit saggy in the boob area and a little thick around the middle, while he just improved like fine wine. He usually shut her up by making love to her until she couldn\u2019t speak, and telling her that he loved her, \u201csaggy boobs, stretch marks, and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, why don\u2019t Blue and Kyle put a leash on their men?\u201d Cleo asked in exasperation, stepping out of his hold and moving toward the bedroom door at a fast waddle. Kyle was Cal\u2019s longtime boyfriend, and they were talking about tying the knot. They\u2019d been together for nearly four years. Cal, who was now the principal male dancer in his company, had never been happier, and Cleo was ecstatic for him.</p> <p>\u201cBlue\u2019s too busy trying to stop Adam\u2019s crying, and Kyle\u2019s teaching Tami and my father a magic trick,\u201d Dante replied. Adam was Blue and Luc\u2019s two-week-old son, their first child. After Dante finally convinced them to take a loan from him four years before, Luc and Blue had, at long last, been able to fix the house and get married. Dante was still trying to convince Cleo\u2019s proud brother to work for him at Damaso International, Inc., but Luc was being stubborn about accepting.</p><p>Dante sauntered out of the room after Cleo and caught up with her at the stairs. He took her elbow as she moved down the stairs, adding his support.</p><p>He was holding her hand as they walked into the chaotic living room. Cal and Luc were still arguing good-humoredly, Adam was screeching at the top of his lungs, Kyle had abandoned the magic tricks and was chasing an excited and squealing three-year-old around the room. Titan, their two-year-old Chihuahua, was chasing after both of them and yapping at the top of his lungs, while Enrique futilely tried to call the tiny dog to heel. Titan and Dante had been inseparable since the dog had been just two months old. It was ridiculous to see them together. And all of them, down to little Adam, were wearing white. Even Titan was wearing a little white T-shirt. The scene filled Cleo with great love while simultaneously making her want to run screeching in the opposite direction. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>None of them spotted Dante and Cleo, who paused in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cWant to make a run for it?\u201d he whispered in her ear, and she looked at him and grinned.</p><p>They quietly backed away from the crazy room and, by unspoken agreement, walked to the kitchen of the beautiful two-story beach house that she and Dante had chosen together. It was situated close to Luc and Blue\u2019s home. They made their way into the sprawling backyard, wandered to the bench in Zach\u2019s garden, and sat down together. Cleo rested her head on his shoulder, and they kept their fingers entwined as they sat quietly together, enjoying the beautiful summer afternoon in silence.</p><p>\u201cStill love me?\u201d he asked, and she angled her eyes up to look into his face. He was looking down at the forget-me-nots, which were in full bloom, and the smile flirting around the edges of his lips told her he wasn\u2019t particularly concerned about her answer.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I suppose I love you,\u201d she said casually, and watched as the smile blossomed on his lips.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one,\u201d he counted.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s counting?\u201d she murmured. This had become one of their favorite little daily rituals. \u201cI love you, I love you, I love you. So much.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head toward her.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, dulzura.\u201d</p>   </body></html>"]
