There are always people who refuse to believe it, or want to analyze what they\u2019ve seen seventy-four times before they even try to accept that reality has changed. I\u2019ve been answering the same questions under oath for them for the last week, so I\u2019m at the end of my patience when I\u2019m summoned, yet again.</p><p>The room-bot tells me, \u201cYour presence is required in conference room 7-J, Sirantha Jax.\u201d</p> <p>Well, of course it is. My eyes burn as I step out into the pristine white corridor. I feel oddly fragile, as if my bones have grown too big for my skin. I haven\u2019t been sleeping well in what used to be Farwan\u2019s staff dormitory, and they won\u2019t let me see March. They\u2019re keeping us sequestered to make sure we don\u2019t synchronize our stories, I guess. The Conglomerate-appointed Taskforce has a great interest in getting at the truth, which is understandable, given that we\u2019ve known only what the Corp chose to disseminate for decades now.</p><p>The Conglomerate spent countless centuries as an impotent coalition of planetary representatives, holding sessions and debating issues that never changed anything. Now all the representatives are gathered on New Terra, jockeying for power and trying to fill the void left by Farwan\u2019s fall. At this point, the Conglomerate can\u2019t be blamed for its zeal. They don\u2019t want someone else to seize control while things whirl in a chaotic spin.</p><p>Doesn\u2019t mean I enjoy these constant, courteous interrogations. I find it difficult not to flash back to all the \u201ccounseling\u201d sessions I suffered after Kai died. Kai was my pilot first, then my friend\u2014and then he was . . . everything. I\u2019d never known it was possible to love as he did\u2014with complete devotion yet devoid of promises. The crash of the Sargasso, engineered by Farwan Corporation, reshaped my world, and for a while I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d survive the shift.</p><p>That\u2019s behind me now. The world has changed because of Kai\u2019s death. People won\u2019t forget him, and that assuages the loss. The other day, I saw on the news, they\u2019re building a monument in Center Park, a small reproduction of the Sargasso with a brass plaque graven with the names of the dead.</p><p>The Conglomerate mines its representatives from corporations and special-interest groups. Only a few come from genuine free elections, devoid of corruption, kickbacks, and nepotism, and I can\u2019t honestly say whether I\u2019ve done a good thing by destroying Farwan. If nothing else, they were stable, and now we have a great chasm at the center, around which everything trembles.</p> <p>But I couldn\u2019t let them get away with murdering Kai.</p><p>People nod at me as I pass through the hallway and into the lift, heading for the seventh floor. I\u2019m a public figure now. I always was to some degree, I suppose. The news vids often flashed images of me, returning from a successful jump, and the gutter press loved to publicize my barroom brawls.</p><p>Bracing myself, I step through the open doorway into conference room 7-J. To my surprise, I don\u2019t find the usual panel of judges and planetary representatives gazing at me with poorly concealed disapproval. Maybe they finally believe I\u2019m telling the truth, but they don\u2019t like me for it. Thanks to me, the status quo has been destroyed, and now we have multiple parties rushing to fill the vacuum, some of which are worse than Farwan. Sometimes the truth doesn\u2019t set you free; it just presents a different set of problems.</p><p>Instead I find Dina, March, and the Chancellor of New Terra. March smiles at me with such warmth that my heart contracts. They\u2019ve cleared him of charges since nobody died during the standoff, plus the resultant broadcast knocked him clean off center stage.</p><p>When he thought I was dead, he stormed Corp headquarters and took the whole building hostage. March didn\u2019t think it would bring me back. He just wanted to watch the man who gave the order die.</p><p>The woman, Dina, looks good, as if she\u2019s been getting some sun, and her blond hair shines with new highlights. When she feels my scrutiny, she discreetly flips me the bird. I barely restrain a smile.</p> <p>You all right? He comes into me quietly.</p><p>Right after I met March, I thought I was going crazy\u2014 and perhaps I was, but not because I sensed him inside my head when he shouldn\u2019t be. Since he\u2019s Psi, he can skim surface thoughts as if he were dipping a net into the water. With most people, that\u2019s all he can do without causing irreparable harm. Our theta waves are compatible, which means he can share a lot more with me.</p><p>I answer with my eyes and a slight smile. Just being in the same room with him makes things better. Easier.</p><p>The Chancellor gazes between us as if sensing subtext. He\u2019s a sharp one. Suni Tarn is a big man, rawboned, with disheveled salt-and-pepper hair, but he wears real silk. A study in contrasts, then. His smile seems sincere as he invites, \u201cTake a seat, Ms. Jax.\u201d</p><p>Warily, I do so. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d</p><p>I expected to find another panel wanting to hear the same story yet again. For some reason, this assembly makes me nervous. March offers a look of quiet reassurance, and some of the tension fades. If it was bad, he\u2019d warn me, surely.</p><p>\u201cThe Conglomerate has served as figurehead long enough, and we\u2019re determined to restructure so that regulatory functions return to our control. No longer will the private sector control tariffs and jump-travel training. After reviewing your testimony, we\u2019d like to repay you for your loyalty to the Conglomerate. It can\u2019t have been easy, staying one jump ahead of Farwan when they were so determined to suppress the truth.\u201d</p><p>After replaying his words in my head, they still ring with governmental doublespeak. \u201cI\u2019m not actually sure what that means.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey intend to make you an ambassador,\u201d Dina says with a smirk.</p><p>Mary, I\u2019ve missed her.</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Tarn nods, folding his hands before him. \u201cThere are a few formerly class-P worlds that have reached the correct level of technology to be considered for addition to the Conglomerate. There are also a number of xenophobic planets from which we need to recruit representatives. If they are allowed to secede, they will presume they are exempt from travel regulations and tariffs as well. And that\u2019s how wars start.\u201d</p><p>We share a grim silence, remembering the casualties from the Axis Wars. In the aftermath, Farwan stepped into the breach, offering impartial mediation. They took control by centimeters, and nobody noticed the bloodless coup until the Corp had stripped the Conglomerate of all decision-making autonomy. Oh, the tier worlds still elected representatives every ten turns or so, and they went around talking about \u201cissues,\u201d but Farwan held the real power. Until now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flattered,\u201d I say carefully, because this mission sounds like a great way to get killed. Maybe that\u2019s why they want to send me. I\u2019m no stranger to the notion of peoplewanting to space me to tie up loose ends. \u201cBut my first obligation is to finish what I\u2019ve started. I have people on Lachion counting on me to help them get what they need to found a jump-training academy.\u201d</p><p>March studies me with an inscrutable expression, but I receive a sense that he\u2019s proud of me. This opportunity would keep me in the limelight, almost like being a nav-star again, but I don\u2019t want that life anymore. I want to make love to him in my shabby glastique flat on Gehenna, see how Doc\u2019s doing, and then go find out how we can help on Lachion.</p><p>\u201cThey have everything they could possibly need,\u201d Tarn tells me. \u201cWhen we seized Farwan\u2019s assets, that included their research, and we disbursed the information to all interested parties. Your friends aren\u2019t the only ones engaged in genetically engineering a race better suited to the nav chair. We\u2019re living in an exciting time, full of innovation and change, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see what happens, just like everyone else. However, that leaves you at loose ends, I believe.\u201d</p><p>I can see how Tarn got elected. He has a charming, toothy smile and a persuasive manner. Maybe it\u2019s a reflex left over from dealing with the Corp, but I don\u2019t trust him. He has a point, however.</p><p>If they have all the data they need, which I\u2019ll verify with Keri, then the rest is lab work for Doc to do on his own. I remember those poor women on Hon-Durren\u2019s Kingdom, and part of me shies away. In my time I\u2019ve seen some horrific things, but few things have lingered like that ward of helpless breeders, catatonic females condemned to be used as wombs.</p><p>I don\u2019t like the idea of genetic engineering, but thankfully, it\u2019s not my responsibility. The Conglomerate will appoint arbiters and navigator activists when the time comes, I have no doubt. Still, there won\u2019t be a class for me to train for a while yet, and I\u2019m not the only teacher anymore. Everyone who used to work at the Farwan Academy is now looking for a job, too.</p><p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t need my help on Lachion, I\u2019d rather go back to jumping for its own sake,\u201d I answer finally. \u201cLogging new beacons. That was what I loved.\u201d</p><p>Tarn arches a brow with an indulgent air, almost as if he\u2019s talking to a child. \u201cAnd who\u2019s going to pay you to do that, Sirantha? That isn\u2019t a Conglomerate priority at this time, I\u2019m afraid, and your ship will have expenses: fuel, food, miscellaneous supplies. Not to mention a living wage for the crew.\u201d</p><p>Shit. I\u2019ve never needed to think about a paycheck before. I\u2019m not even sure how much I have in my personal accounts. Living on Farwan stations where they comped everything, I didn\u2019t have to worry about such details.</p><p>If they have no use for me on Lachion right now, then I\u2019d just be living off Keri\u2019s largesse, and they\u2019re already going through tough times because of me. Then it sinks in. I actually need a job, and I\u2019m probably not in a position to turn down an offer at the moment.</p><p>I\u2019ll need to check my financials as soon as possible, assuming my assets haven\u2019t been frozen because they came from Farwan. Surely that\u2019s not possible. I won\u2019t feel easy about it until I find out, though.</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d That\u2019s a last-ditch effort to refute the inevitable.</p><p>\u201cWe want you and your crew to start with Ithiss-Tor. You\u2019re in a unique position, as . . .\u201d Tarn checks his notes on the datapad. \u201cVelith Il-Nok, a bounty hunter of some repute, is willing to travel with you to his homeworld and help you traverse the obstacles that tripped up other ambassadors.</p><p>\u201cNeedless to say, this mission does present its share of dangers. Given the current state of the shipping lanes, you will be fortunate to get there in one piece.\u201d He pauses to let the gravity of his statement sink in.</p><p>Oh, how I wish he were kidding. But Tarn doesn\u2019t seem to have much of a sense of humor. And he\u2019s right. Pirates, raiders, smugglers . . . they all know there\u2019s no strong Corp militia coming to kick their asses anymore; the time has never been better for them to ply their trade and push the lawless frontier a little closer to civilization.</p><p>It\u2019s going to be a fucking mess out there. And it\u2019s largely my fault. I sigh and scrub my hand over my face as Tarn continues, \u201cSo I\u2019ll allow you twenty-four hours to discuss the opportunity with your crew. You\u2019ll find the Conglomerate most generous, however, if you should choose to join our employ.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDoes this mean we\u2019re finished with the hearings? We\u2019re free to do as we please?\u201d I wouldn\u2019t quite call what they did to us house arrest, but it was close. As I mentioned, we weren\u2019t permitted to fraternize with each other at all.</p><p>Tarn nods. \u201cWe have all the testimony we need from you. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m expected in 12-H for a bounce-relay chat with Ielos.\u201d With that, the Chancellor heads for the door.</p><p>I sigh. Sure, we\u2019ll discuss it, but I know the smell of an offer I can\u2019t refuse.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p> <p>\u201cSo what do you two think?\u201d</p><p>If I go, they\u2019re going with me. That much is a given.</p><p>Dina grimaces and pushes to her feet. She\u2019s a stocky woman who could kick my ass with one hand tied behind her back, but luckily, she doesn\u2019t want to anymore. I don\u2019t think.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a sucker\u2019s job.\u201d Then she grins. \u201cAnd we\u2019re just the suckers to do it. How bad could it be?\u201d</p><p>I stare at her. \u201cWhy do you have to say shit like that? Seriously. Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause it makes you nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig deal,\u201d I mutter. \u201cEverything makes me nervous. It\u2019s a wonder I haven\u2019t developed a tic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have,\u201d March puts in, ever helpful. \u201cYour left eye sort of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, baby. You\u2019re a gem.\u201d</p><p>He smirks, the expression that used to make me want to slap him. Now it makes me want to tie him up and do things to him until he says he\u2019s sorry.</p><p>\u201cWe should check with the Chancellor\u2019s assistant. I\u2019m sure they have an itinerary for us,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>I shrug. \u201cWe have twenty-four hours. After all this, they owe us some rec time.\u201d</p><p>For once Dina agrees with me. \u201cDo they ever. This place is a dump.\u201d She dismisses the sterile conference room with four blank bisque walls with a contemptuous gesture. \u201cIsn\u2019t there anything to do here?\u201d</p><p>Thinking back to my training days, I try to remember. \u201cNot by Gehenna or even Venice Minor standards. But there are a few good bars in Wickville over on the west side. At least there used to be. Place called Quincy\u2019s had a trio that played folkazz, good stuff. But remember, I\u2019ve been gone a long time\u2014\u201d</p><p>I find myself talking to her back. If I know her at all, she\u2019ll catch a lift over to where she\u2019s likely to find a party and leave the details up to us. Our ship\u2019s mechanic lives for a good time and makes no bones about it.</p><p>Oddly, I respect her for that. Dina doesn\u2019t dwell on everything she\u2019s lost. The woman surpasses me in that regard, but she doesn\u2019t brood over it. Doesn\u2019t use it like a weapon to make other people feel sorry for her.</p><p>Without a word, March pulls me into his arms. I hope nobody else needs the conference room because it doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s letting go anytime soon. He rests his cheek against the top of my stubbly head. Just after we landed on New Terra\u2014before the bounty hunter snatched me\u2014my crewmates decided I\u2019d be less recognizable without my hair. I still can\u2019t believe they shaved my head for nothing.</p><p>March tightens his arms around me, and I luxuriate in his heat. This separation has been harder on him than on me because first he thought I was dead, and then before he could make the mental adjustment, they quarantined us to prepare for our testimonies.</p><p>A shudder runs through him. \u201cSometimes I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll wake up and you won\u2019t be here.\u201d</p> <p>Part of me\u2014the part that\u2019s still raw over losing Kai\u2014 wants to back away from such unabashed need. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t handle it, that I\u2019ll hurt him again like I did on Gehenna. Part of me needs him every bit as much, though. I\u2019m afraid of that, too. I wasn\u2019t always such a contrary bundle of fears. That\u2019s new.</p><p>I like the person I am now, though. Jax the nav-star didn\u2019t care for anyone but Kai, certainly didn\u2019t care about the state of the universe or acting in the interest of the greater good. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m cut out to be a hero like March, but I want to try. Not for the fame and glory but because I want to leave something behind that matters more than the number of jumps I made. I want things to be better because of me. He lifts his head, and his gaze meets mine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d I say aloud, though it isn\u2019t a surety I can truly offer. Life is precarious, and it turns in a flash. As if he knows this, his lips drift over mine, delicately possessive. His kiss sparks a chemical reaction, endorphins careening wildly.</p><p>Lifting his head, March exhales slowly. \u201cYou want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>A throat clears behind us. \u201cWe have a meeting scheduled,\u201d someone says in the polite tone that conceals amusement.</p><p>We break apart like kids caught necking on the front doorstep. I smile over that as we hurry out of 7-J. Once we get some distance down the hall, I pause and gaze up at him. He\u2019s no prettier than when I first laid eyes on him. March still looks mean as a black-tailed rattler, but as always, I focus on his dark, gold-flecked eyes fringed in those ridiculously luxurious lashes.</p><p>It\u2019s just as well he has such a hard-hewn face. With those eyes, he\u2019d just be too pretty if he were anywhere close to handsome. Besides, I look like a war refugee these days, scrawny, scarred, and bald as an egg, so I can\u2019t have some beautiful man outshining me.</p><p>\u201cDo I want to . . . ?\u201d I arch a brow at him, as if I don\u2019t know perfectly well what he\u2019s going to suggest.</p><p>He grins. \u201cGo to Wickville and listen to some folkazz.\u201d</p><p>Okay, he got me. He\u2019s the mind reader, not me, which is just as well. I\u2019d be dangerous if I could do what March does. Hell, I\u2019m dangerous anyway.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNot really. Not in the mood.\u201d</p><p>We start walking again, meandering along the corridor to the lift. \u201cYou want to bounce a message to Lachion? Double-check what Tarn told us?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cWe should try to find an independent relay computer, too. I don\u2019t trust station terminals.\u201d</p><p>March doesn\u2019t argue as we step into the tube. A whooshing sound sends us to our floor, and as we get out, he asks, \u201cYou sure this isn\u2019t more paranoia, Jax?\u201d</p><p>He has a point. My instincts are a mess. I\u2019m prone to flipping out for no reason after the Psychs finished tinkering with my brain.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But people who want something from you never tell the whole truth, so I need to check his story. See what Keri says. I don\u2019t want to have traded one corrupt master for another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolute power corrupts absolutely.\u201d</p><p>I stop outside my quarters. \u201cAre you saying all this was for nothing? The Conglomerate will eventually be as thoroughly raddled with dirty politics, kickbacks, suppression of information, and borderline tyranny as the Corp?\u201d</p><p>He hesitates as if weighing his words. \u201cIt\u2019s change. Who knows exactly what\u2019s in store? Right now everything\u2019s in a state of upheaval. Historians will draw the conclusions, not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeh. With my luck, I\u2019ll be known as the one who ended an era of peace and prosperity, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but you\u2019ll be dead, and you won\u2019t care. Now go bundle up, and I\u2019ll do the same. Meet you back here?\u201d</p><p>I remember we\u2019re in Ankaraj, which means snow, and the wind tears through you like a steel hook. \u201cNah, just wait for me downstairs.\u201d</p><p>One of these days, I\u2019m going to get ready faster than he does. But not today. By the time I find an overcoat and layer my clothing to withstand the winter chill, I find him lounging in the foyer.</p><p>He takes in the navy s-wool coat with hood and muffler paired with clunky brown boots. To think I used to be considered one of the best-dressed women in the tier worlds\u2014 in fact, I made the list twice. I sigh a little. On the plus side, I gained ten kilos in clothing, and the way I look now, that\u2019s a good thing.</p><p>\u201cCute,\u201d he pronounces.</p><p>I wish he\u2019d shot me. \u201cBastard.\u201d</p><p>First order of business is to find a non-Corp, non-Conglomerate terminal where we can bounce a message to Keri. That will cost money, so we\u2019ll need to hit a bank first. Maybe March can cover it, but I need to be independent. The idea of being dependent on anyone, for anything, makes me feel odd and queasy.</p><p>That means checking on the status of my personal accounts, which Simon, the estranged husband who tried to have me killed, better not have fucked with. I also need to have a new pay-card issued. Mary only knows the turmoil of the currency situation. Maybe Corp credits have been devalued entirely. Shit, I hope not.</p><p>Drawing my hood up around my ears, I head for the door. Stop short.</p><p>The woman drawing back a gorgeous, filmy thermal scarf looks eerily familiar. She shakes a few flakes of snow from her ink-dark hair, managing to look graceful and elegant while she does so. Her perfectly painted mouth rounds into an \u201cO\u201d when she registers me.</p><p>\u201cSirantha?\u201d she chokes out.</p><p>\u201cMother?\u201d</p><p>For March\u2019s sake, I make the introduction. \u201cThis is Ramona Jax, my mother. Mother, this is March.\u201d</p><p>Let them make of each other what they will.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>Half an hour later, we\u2019re sitting in a caf\u00e9 near what used to be Farwan headquarters, though it\u2019s now the Conglomerate Command Center on New Terra. Few patrons are sitting in the restaurant this time of day, too late for breakfast and too early for lunch. The place is done in tones of amber and gold, heavy, fringed shades giving the room a diffuse, smoky glow, frosted by the ice on the outside of the windows.</p><p>It\u2019s eerie. My mother doesn\u2019t look a day older than when I left. Either she didn\u2019t worry about me, or she spent my father\u2019s money on antiaging treatments. My credits, assuming I still have some, are on both.</p><p>\u201cThe shock killed him,\u201d she\u2019s saying. \u201cEverywhere he went, someone asked, \u2018Isn\u2019t that your daughter?\u2019 when they flashed that horrid picture of you. He just couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I always knew there was something wrong with it, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d I\u2019ve barely recovered from her first tactless announcement, and a stabbing pain between my shoulder blades prompts March to regard me with concern.</p><p>Can\u2019t believe nobody told me.</p><p>\u201cYou loved working for the Corp. Mary knows you defied everything we wanted for you to do it, so I knew you wouldn\u2019t have run off without a good reason.\u201d</p><p>Heh. She calls everything I went through after the Sargasso \u201crunning off.\u201d This fundamental disconnect would be why I left New Terra in the first place. I can\u2019t believe my dad is gone, though it explains her glamorous interpretation of widow\u2019s weeds.</p><p>\u201cNo, she wouldn\u2019t,\u201d March puts in.</p><p>I can see Ramona assessing him, trying to figure us out. With a faint half smile, he makes it easy for her by curling his arm around me. I lean in, watching her warily. She wants something, or she wouldn\u2019t be here. But what does she think I can do for her? That\u2019s the question.</p><p>The small talk continues, and she sidles around the subject of the crash and my dead lover, unpleasantness we shouldn\u2019t dwell on, according to her. Ramona does mention that she knows a lovely cosmetic surgeon who could help me with those \u201cunsightly marks\u201d via laser therapy. I set my jaw. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cI want to keep them.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve been together less than an hour, and already exasperation shows in her tone. \u201cWell, for Mary\u2019s sake, why, Sirantha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like to pretend bad things never happen. I prefer to remember, so I won\u2019t make the same mistakes again.\u201d I flick a glance at March. \u201cBesides, guys dig them.\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cI do. They make you look dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>This place is automated. Most places have a human programmer who supervises the equipment, but otherwise, the caf\u00e9 is nearly empty, just us and a couple of others across the room. I shift long enough to tap out an order for hot choclaste on the wall panel. The kitchen-mate at our table handles basic requests. Anything complex or exotic would be forwarded to the gourmet unit in the kitchen, and an autoserver would bring it to us. March doesn\u2019t like them, but I think they\u2019re cute, little beverage carts on wheels, equipped with a primitive AI chip.</p><p>My mother pauses to regroup, studying March with what would be a narrow-eyed stare, except that might cause wrinkles. Still, the impression remains via the intensity of her regard. He doesn\u2019t flinch. At last she looks away, and I have the sense he\u2019s won something without knowing what it is.</p><p>\u201cI understand they plan to appoint you as ambassador for New Terra,\u201d Ramona begins.</p><p>Talk about a subject change. We\u2019re finally getting down to the meat of why she came looking for me, though. It wasn\u2019t to hug me and bask in her gratitude that I\u2019m all right. My mother doesn\u2019t possess a scintilla of pure maternal sentiment.</p><p>I raise a brow. \u201cHow could you possibly know that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I hear things.\u201d She waves a hand in an airy, elegant gesture that would look ridiculous from anyone else.</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d My dry tone is lost on her.</p><p>\u201cIndeed. Do you plan to accept the appointment?\u201d She seems nervous, almost frightened, in fact. Her red-lacquered nails tap out a subliminal statement on the glastique table.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d become a junk dealer.\u201d Yes, I\u2019m baiting her deliberately. \u201cMaybe do salvage runs, or possibly just settle down on New Terra and go to work in recycling. Have some brats. Would you like that?\u201d I ask March.</p><p>You\u2019re so evil, he tells me silently.</p><p>Then he chokes out, eyes watering, \u201cWhatever you want.\u201d</p> <p>Shit, I wish I\u2019d recorded that. I can think of any number of situations where playback would come in handy.</p><p>\u201cNo! Oh, Sirantha, you mustn\u2019t even joke.\u201d She reaches for my hand, where it\u2019s curled around my cup. \u201cYou simply must take the post.\u201d</p><p>Here we go.</p><p>My choclaste has cooled enough to drink, so I take a sip to cover my annoyance. This means pulling away from her, of course, which was the whole point. I intend to accept Tarn\u2019s offer, but my inclination toward a course of action always plummets in direct correlation to someone\u2019s demand. Call me contrary.</p><p>\u201cMust I? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need someone like you on Ithiss-Tor,\u201d she replies. \u201cJust go and be yourself, and everything will be fine.\u201d Her posture reflects anxiety and duress.</p><p>Since Ramona has been trying to annihilate my personality since I was eight years old, I tense. Something really isn\u2019t right. March confirms my impression with a nod. Now he\u2019s frowning as well.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s \u2018we\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes dart around the nearly deserted coffeehouse, as if she suspects an eavesdropper. This isn\u2019t like her, at least, not the woman I remember. She\u2019s a society darling, a flighty little butterfly, and I was supposed to be one, too.</p><p>\u201cPeople I owe money,\u201d she whispers, and her dark eyes well up with tears.</p><p>I\u2019m staggered by that. \u201cWhat? Who? What happened?\u201d</p><p>It takes her a moment to collect herself. \u201cWe owned stock in Farwan. When . . . everything happened, we were ruined. I didn\u2019t know; your father didn\u2019t tell me. I went on, as I always had, spending . . . it wasn\u2019t until your father . . . died that . . .\u201d</p><p>I can piece together the rest. My father killed himself over their reversal in fortune. Who could possibly expect him to get a job? People came to his gallery because he had money, not because he had impeccable taste. Once the cache was gone, the gallery would\u2019ve gone straight down, too.</p><p>And my mother kept spending money she didn\u2019t have. What I don\u2019t understand is why her creditors want me on Ithiss-Tor.</p><p>\u201cWhat does this have to do with me?\u201d Maybe that sounds cruel.</p><p>Perhaps some women would be overcome by sentiment and obligation, despite the long estrangement, but they didn\u2019t lift a finger to help me when I was in trouble. I can count on one hand the people who did, and Ramona doesn\u2019t make the A-list.</p><p>\u201cWe cannot allow a successful diplomatic mission to Ithiss-Tor.\u201d</p><p>I start at the deep, mechanical voice emitting from a jeweled brooch on my mother\u2019s jacket. No wonder she\u2019s been watching her words. They\u2019re monitoring us.</p><p>Do I answer it? My mother\u2019s face pales until her skin looks like clotted milk. Her hands tremble, so she squeezes them into fists and rubs them against her thighs.</p><p>March makes the decision for me. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a hint of feedback as the pin replies, \u201cSliders, Bugs, whatever you choose to call them, represent a threat to our way of life. We cannot take the risk that they will respond favorably to Conglomerate overtures and make plans to infiltrate our society on a widespread basis.\u201d</p><p>I really don\u2019t get it. If that\u2019s their stance, however xenophobic, doesn\u2019t it make more sense to ask me not to go? Ramona says nothing, seeming paralyzed with fear. Oh, the irony\u2014she probably spent money they didn\u2019t have on that piece of jewelry, which her new masters then turned into an electronic leash.</p><p>\u201cHow does Jax play into that?\u201d I\u2019m content to let March ask the questions. He\u2019ll cover anything I want to know; there\u2019s a real benefit to this whole symbiotic bond, apart from mind-blowing sex.</p><p>Absently, he strokes my upper arm. It\u2019s strange to be having a conversation with someone I can neither see nor picture in my mind\u2019s eye. The voice coming from my mother\u2019s left bosom sounds distorted and altogether lacks any human quality. Who could have bought up her marks?</p><p>\u201cMs. Jax has a history of strewing destruction and disorder wherever she goes. We are content that if she goes to Ithiss-Tor, the natives will want nothing more to do with the Conglomerate. We cannot take the risk that Chancellor Tarn will select a candidate greater skilled in oration, tact, and diplomacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t go,\u201d my mother whispers, \u201cthey\u2019ll kill me.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>\u201cl wouldn\u2019t have put it so dramatically,\u201d the pin says. \u201cBut that is, in effect, correct. On the other hand, if you take this assignment, we will see clear to forgive your mother\u2019s debts. I should imagine even you have this much filial affection.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even know what to say to that. They\u2019re so convinced I\u2019ll fuck this up, they aren\u2019t even asking me to try to make a mess of it. It\u2019s enough that I go? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been insulted so casually in my whole life.</p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d the voice continues, \u201cif by some unlikely chance, your diplomatic mission proceeds well, then I\u2019m afraid we shall be forced to collect our pound of flesh.\u201d</p><p>Ah, there we go\u2014the stick by which they try to force me to do their bidding. My mother whimpers. Above my left eye, I swear I feel twitching; maybe March wasn\u2019t kidding about the tic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d already decided to take the job,\u201d I say coolly. \u201cMore than that, I will not promise.\u201d</p><p>The thing responds, \u201cThat will suffice . . . for now. We will reevaluate your mother\u2019s situation once we see how your task proceeds.\u201d</p><p>Her brooch crackles as it stops transmitting. Ramona looks older somehow, as if her maquillage has cracked, revealing worn skin beneath. \u201cYou\u2019ve bought me a little time,\u201d she manages at last. \u201cFor that I thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me.\u201d I feel savage. I\u2019d like to slap her for being so silly. \u201cWho the hell did you borrow money from?\u201d</p><p>At first she tries to bluff. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, so many documents, and it\u2019s all so complicated\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she doesn\u2019t know about my ace in the hole. I didn\u2019t ask him to do it, never would, but sometimes need-to-know outweighs right-to-privacy. I\u2019m glad March has to weigh those concerns instead of me. If he left the judgments in my hands, I\u2019m afraid I would use him like an inquisitor.</p><p>The Syndicate? Even in thought, I hear his incredulity. I know\u2014I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s that stupid either. They\u2019ve taken organized crime to a whole new level.</p><p>No wonder my father took a safe, painless death. At least I hope he did. I should ask if he used a state-sanctioned Eutha-booth. That requires a Psych profile and an affidavit attesting someone is in his right mind when he decides to end it all. This precaution removes all possibility that a bereaved family will sue the state because the situation could have been ameliorated with medication or dream therapy.</p><p>Sometimes death presents the ultimate solution, though. I\u2019ve never been one to look at it like that, as I want to make sure I suck every last drop out of this life before seeing what comes next. I used to believe it was nothing, just a void, but now I\u2019m not so sure. I\u2019ve seen miracles happen. Lived to tell of them. At this point, I\u2019m willing to concede I just can\u2019t know.</p><p>Ramona stares across the table at us, growing visibly unsettled. If I\u2019d known how well silence worked at keeping people off balance, I\u2019d have curbed my tongue years ago. Okay, probably not. But maybe I\u2019d have tried harder.</p><p>\u201cThe Syndicate?\u201d I say aloud.</p><p>Her eyes widen, showing threads of red in the white. I see every fleck of mascara she\u2019s used to thicken her lashes, and the dark liner beneath looks spidery somehow. Her prettiness is an illusion now, cunning layers of paint to hide the truth.</p><p>\u201cHow did you\u2014\u201d She stops, likely realizing her words comprise an admission.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not important.\u201d I take another sip of choclaste.</p><p>I\u2019ll never give March\u2019s secret away. Too many people would want to destroy him if they knew. He\u2019s never been through Corp training; he doesn\u2019t have the safeguards in place that prevent him from raping another mind just because he can. Maybe that should terrify me because of our bond, but I know he\u2019d never hurt me on purpose. He\u2019s had ample opportunity since we\u2019ve been together\u2014and as for the rest of the universe, it can look out for itself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re different,\u201d she observes. \u201cAnd I\u2019m done for. They think you\u2019ll go out there and make a mess of it. But you won\u2019t, will you?\u201d</p><p>I won\u2019t lie. It hurts a little to make the admission. \u201cNot on purpose. I won\u2019t set out to create an interstellar incident, not even for you.\u201d</p><p>Ramona smiles, a soft tremulous twist of her mouth. \u201cThen I suppose we\u2019re finished. I should follow after your father if I have any sense.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid he . . . ?\u201d</p><p>To my surprise, she picks up the cue. Neither one of us specializes in subtlety or subtext. I suppose you adapt or die. \u201cYes. Dr. Harmon certified him. It was quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I swallow back the lump in my throat. \u201cLook, I have some business to take care of before our departure. I\u2019ll wish you luck, however you sort things out.\u201d</p><p>March pays our tab with a swipe of his card. Mary, why do I feel this ridiculous weight as I walk away from her? She looks so alone, sitting in the coffeehouse with her stupid big hair and her black dress with the jewelry that monitors her movements.</p> <p>At the door, I collect my layer of outer garments and wrap up again. We step out into the white swirl of an Ankaraj winter. He takes my hand, and I feel his warmth through two centimeters of s-wool.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re not giving her another thought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you?\u201d</p><p>He considers for a moment. \u201cI can\u2019t say. My mother died when I was five. My father remarried, and my step-mother never cared for me, but she had Svetlana . . .\u201d The wind carries his words away, or perhaps he simply doesn\u2019t want to talk about her. \u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t know. It just seems strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does?\u201d When I spy a gap in traffic, I make a break for it. We\u2019re getting our own Skimmer, dammit. I\u2019ll try to talk the guy at the garage into loaning us one. I need to find a bank.</p> <p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t think you ever gave up on people you love, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. Low blow. We duck into the tunnel that leads down to the vehicle-maintenance bays. The Corp owned a fleet and a half, and the Conglomerate is still taking inventory. They won\u2019t notice if one vanishes for an hour or so. The ramp winds down and around for quite a ways, but at least we\u2019re out of the wind.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen her in sixteen years. And I didn\u2019t like her when I lived with my folks. Sometimes I find it hard to believe Ramona is my biological mother.\u201d</p><p>Lucky break, I know the guy working this level. Squid washed out of the academy because he suffers from heterochromia iridium, which he hid by wearing one tinted contact. Unfortunately, two different eye colors meant he didn\u2019t possess the J-gene, and he lost some IQ points inside the simulator before they got him out. These days he\u2019s only fit to patrol the vehicle-maintenance lot.</p><p>The thermal vents mean I can pull off my hood. Should have known something was wrong when my mother didn\u2019t say anything about my hair, or lack of it, as soon as I bared myself at the caf\u00e9. I wave to Squid, who glances behind him to see who else I might be signaling.</p><p>Damn, what\u2019s his real name? Ira. Huh, Squid might actually be better, though the name was meant as a jab at his IQ.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Ira! How\u2019s it going? How\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhm. Okay.\u201d He pauses with an expression of what I take to be perpetual confusion. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d</p><p>I smile at him. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time. We were at the academy together. You think you can hook me up with a Skimmer?\u201d</p><p>His moon-pale brow wrinkles up in a scowl. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to let anyone take them. They\u2019ve been . . .\u201d Ira struggles over the word, and I wince in sympathy, though he doesn\u2019t notice. \u201cConfiscated!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that doesn\u2019t apply to the newly appointed ambassador of New Terra,\u201d March says smoothly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, confirm with Chancellor Tarn. Of course, he might be annoyed with you for making the ambassador wait, as well as interrupting his conference with the Ielosian representatives.\u201d</p><p>Damn, the man is good; poor Ira looks bewildered. I imagine I don\u2019t look like an ambassador, but then again, how many would he have seen, spending his life roaming around vehicle maintenance? If this works, this gig might have perks I hadn\u2019t even imagined. Assuming I don\u2019t die horribly on the way to Ithiss-Tor.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were an ambassador,\u201d Ira says finally. \u201cYou should really have a badge or something. I can let you borrow a B-class Skimmer, but you have to bring it back before my shift ends at five. Please?\u201d he adds, as if remembering he needs to be polite to me.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d March assures him. \u201cWe have no plans to leave the city.\u201d</p> <p>That sends a cold chill down my back. Famous last words, best-laid plans, and all that. March takes the codes that will start the engine, and I follow him toward the black-and-red-striped one in the far corner. Ira trails behindus, obviously conflicted. I gather he likes following the rules, and we\u2019ve made him break them.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019re you anyway?\u201d he asks March.</p><p>Who flashes his saturnine smile. \u201cI\u2019m the guy who kills anyone that messes with the ambassador.\u201d</p><p>Wow, I like the sound of that. Ira doesn\u2019t venture any more questions before the engine purrs to life. Then we\u2019re up, up, and away.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>There\u2019s nothing like riding a Skimmer, even when it\u2019s this cold.</p><p>The speed, the control, the hint of danger as we swoop around the city. Ankaraj isn\u2019t a pretty settlement, glittering metal bones jutting from the snow with more determination than grace. I\u2019ve never been sure why the Corp chose to center its headquarters here. Even though New Terra can\u2019t compete with other worlds in terms of natural beauty\u2014and functions as nothing so much as a farm colony\u2014it certainly possesses sites more scenic than this.</p><p>I hold on tight to March while the wind whips against my face. For these moments, I am perfectly, gloriously free. I don\u2019t need to think about the future, my obligations, or what\u2019s in store for us on Ithiss-Tor. March knows I can\u2019t stand feeling trapped. Shit, being planet-bound is bad enough. He intuits what those days trapped inside the cave, then later confined to quarters because of the Conglomerate inquiry, meant to me.</p><p>If not for Velith Il-Nok, the bounty hunter slotted to accompany me to Ithiss-Tor, I would have died in a Corp asylum,after taking the blame for any number of their crimes. He and I spent several nerve-wracking days riding out a storm in a cave off the Teresengi Basin, after he killed his own crew on my behalf. They were monsters, no doubt, but he\u2019d hired them in good faith. To someone like Vel, his word is his bond. But I can\u2019t think about what I owe him, or guilt will set in. I\u2019m not used to owing people debts so big, I have no coin to pay.</p><p>By the time we park outside a Transplanetary Bank, my fingers feel vaguely numb. I can\u2019t even remember the account numbers to get past the first security check, so we\u2019re forced to push the call button. An irritated blond man flashes onto the vid screen above the double doors.</p><p>\u201cThis location doesn\u2019t handle transplanetary wires or open new accounts,\u201d he tells me brusquely. \u201cFor that, you need to visit our wonderful new branch in the city center, just two blocks from the AquaDome.\u201d</p><p>Before he can turn off the feed, I answer, \u201cI have an account here already, I just can\u2019t remember the code.\u201d</p><p>He sighs as if I\u2019m mentally defective. \u201cI\u2019ll send someone.\u201d</p><p>At least fifteen minutes pass before a stocky brunette appears to unlock the doors manually. Her expression radiates disapproval for customers who forget their account codes. If I\u2019d entered them, the door would have verified them as viable with in-house security and their AI would have unlocked the doors for fifteen seconds. It\u2019s not a foolproof system, but it cuts down on passersby asking to use the lavatory, at least.</p><p>\u201cHow can I help you today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy looking up my account information,\u201d I say, as she leads us toward her workstation.</p><p>\u201cI need to scan your thumb and index finger. You can provide additional information if you like, but it is unlikely to be required.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem.\u201d I let her zap me with her wand.</p><p>Transplanetary Bank doesn\u2019t believe in embellishing the workplace: beige walls, beige carpet, and one fake plant. Her desk is even beige, built of heavy synthetic wood. A prominent nameplate reads SILVIA KUYEIDI, which means she\u2019s descended from the original settlers. I wonder whether her distant ancestors, who revered raven and wolf totems, would approve of her career in banking.</p><p>Then again, so what? My distant ancestors specialized in spending money and putting on airs. They wouldn\u2019t be impressed with me either.</p><p>While she taps away, I unwind some of my layers, my least favorite part of a cold climate. They don\u2019t offer chairs for clients unless you\u2019re important enough to be ushered into a private suite. I guess we don\u2019t qualify.</p><p>When March grins, I don\u2019t need to be a mind reader to know he\u2019s considering a reprise of the whole ambassador bit. That\u2019s going to take some getting used to. I fidget, trying to ignore the unusual aches and pains I\u2019ve acquired along the way.</p><p>Ms. Kuyeidi bites her lip. Uh-oh. I know that look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have bad news, Ms. Jax. When you were . . .\u201d She makes a moue that I interpret as discomfort. \u201c. . . declared dead, your husband filed a next of kin claim, and we consolidated your accounts. And when the Conglomerate froze all Corp assets, that included the personal accounts of Corp executives, such as your husband, who are now awaiting trial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means . . . ?\u201d I don\u2019t really need her to say it. I\u2019m broke.</p><p>\u201cYour accounts have been closed.\u201d Ms. Kuyeidi refuses to meet my eyes, which tells me she\u2019s aware how shitty this is. \u201cI can provide you with the amount that your husband received at the time of your . . . er, death,\u201d she adds. \u201cPerhaps the Conglomerate can see about retrieving the wrongfully allotted funds. Such inquiries take time, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they do,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t be of more assistance, Ambassador.\u201d She speaks the last word with a conspiratorial air. I must have looked perplexed because she adds, \u201cI saw the announcement on the news just before you arrived. I didn\u2019t recognize you right away, though. Your hair . . .\u201d</p><p>Great. My mother doesn\u2019t comment on it, but the bank lady does. I muster a smile. \u201cYes, I look quite different now.\u201d</p><p>Silvia sees us to the door. After thanking her, I stomp out into the cold and immediately regret the impulse. I shiver from head to toe as I rewrap myself. Feeling me tremble, March powers up the thermal vents, which help a little.</p><p>\u201cSo what now?\u201d he asks, as we climb back on the Skimmer.</p><p>These little beauties can toggle between hover and ground mode with the flick of a switch. Speeding over the ice is the closest thing on earth to flying, and it carries a unique thrill. Any other time, I\u2019d beg him to break some records on the tundra\u2014final remnant of the Jax I used to be\u2014but right now I need to get this sorted out.</p><p>\u201cBack to headquarters, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Tarn can help you?\u201d he calls over the roaring wind.</p><p>I shrug, knowing he\u2019ll catch the movement as well as the accompanying thoughts. Tarn will offer to \u201clook into the matter,\u201d but my hope of recovering that 100K hinges on how things go on Ithiss-Tor. That\u2019s politics for you, a filthy polyglot of one hand washing the other until everything\u2019s unclean. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suddenly glum, I rest my chin against March\u2019s back. If I succeed, they\u2019ll kill my mother. If I fail, I\u2019ll be jobless, penniless, and the laughingstock of the tier worlds, assuming the Bugs don\u2019t execute me for some breach of etiquette.</p><p>And that doesn\u2019t begin to factor in the danger we\u2019ll be in, trying to get to Ithiss-Tor. I didn\u2019t realize how much the clockwork Corp patrols factored into keeping the star lanes safe. I hope pirates and raiders will be too busy jacking cargo vessels to mess with a small cutter like ours.</p><p>A surge of heat beneath me catches my attention, but it\u2019s the high-pitched whine coming from the Skimmer that alarms me. I hear March mutter, \u201cShit,\u201d as he lets go of the controls and rolls hard left. Since I\u2019m holding on to him, I fall as he does.</p><p>We hit the ground and tumble, careening into packed snow and stacked garbage cans. My hip feels like it has ground glass embedded in it. The Skimmer continues in its flight, but it slows without a hand on the throttle. Midair, it shudders and then blows into shards, raining fire and ash down on us.</p> <p>I cover my head as the larger pieces plummet to earth. The icy air smells of burning metal. Ah, shit. Ira\u2019s gonna be pissed. Hope he doesn\u2019t get in trouble, poor bastard has enough problems. Then again, if being an ambassador means anything, I should have the power to promote him out of it.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d If I had a credit for every time March has asked me that question, I wouldn\u2019t be mourning my missing money.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll live.\u201d I can\u2019t restrain a whimper as he pulls me to my feet. \u201cWhat are the chances this was a routine malfunction?\u201d</p><p>Mouth compressed to a white line, he shakes his head. \u201cSlim to none.\u201d</p><p>I test my left hip, the one that took the impact, by taking a step, and fire streaks up my thigh. To cover this, I try to sum up our situation, ticking off the points on my gloved fingertips. \u201cSo one faction\u2014the Conglomerate\u2014wants me to succeed on Ithiss-Tor because they want to strengthen their position as the galactic governing body. Another faction\u2014the Syndicate\u2014wants me to fail because periods rife with chaos are good for the smuggler\u2019s bottom line. And an unknown faction doesn\u2019t want me to get there at all.\u201d</p> <p>March nods his agreement. \u201cThis was meant as a preventive measure. I\u2019m not sure if they thought they\u2019d end you like this or just put the fear of Mary in you.\u201d</p><p>I snort. \u201cThat\u2019d take more than a bunged-up Skimmer, at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know you like I do.\u201d With careful fingertips, he traces a feathery touch over my brows, and I feel that lovely little spark. Now\u2019s not the time, though. \u201cCan you walk?\u201d</p><p>I rake a quick look around the alley. \u201cDo I have a choice? This looks like Wickville, where auto-cab stands are few and far between.\u201d</p><p>His face looks sharp and harsh within the shadowed frame of his black hood, but his eyes soften his whole mien. March swings me up into his arms. \u201cYou always have a choice, as long as I\u2019m around. If you\u2019d rather, we\u2019ll hop a ship to Maha City, claim some land according to the New Homestead Act, and plant rutabagas or something. Is that what you want, Jax?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, just a moment, I consider it. Imagine being planet-bound, no more grimspace, no more wildfire, no more notoriety. Just a quiet life easing into a quiet death. I could almost, almost manage it, with March by my side.</p> <p>Then I shake my head, smiling. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m what Chancellor Jackson had in mind when he set out to attract honest, hardworking citizens to New Terra. Besides . . . I didn\u2019t become a jumper to die old and gray.\u201d</p><p>Something flashes in his dark eyes, something stark and raw. His answering smile looks like it hurts in ways I can\u2019t conceive. \u201cI was afraid you\u2019d say that.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>As he carries me through the Wickville warren, l re flect on what it means for March to love me.</p><p>The man\u2019s known nothing but loss his whole life. With me he can expect more of the same. I\u2019m a jumper to the core, complete with all the reckless, thrill-seeking urges. Though I\u2019ve changed since I first met him, and I\u2019d like to believe for the better, I\u2019m never going to be a safe bet.</p><p>I\u2019m not a woman you bring home to Mother, pick out china patterns with, or Mary forefend, breed. I\u2019ve seen a chunk of the universe, true, but there\u2019s still so much more to see. I doubt I\u2019ll ever cure this wanderlust, and I\u2019m content with dedicating my life to failing to sate it.</p><p>Then again, maybe if I checked with him, he\u2019d say he would rather have two weeks with me than twenty safe years with someone else. After all, that\u2019s what I\u2019d say if he asked me. Kai taught me nothing comes with a guarantee.</p><p>The sky darkens overhead, heavy with impending snow, and on the far horizon, the setting sun smears the white plain with a diffuse glow. Each breath stings the inside of my nostrils, puffs out like smoke. It\u2019s becoming clear we are unequivocally lost, and we\u2019re starting to draw attention. With March carrying me, we look vulnerable. That brings out the predatory instincts in people.</p> <p>Buildings low-slung and close together separate Wickville from Ankaraj proper. There, everything shines with chrome and glastique, and even the gutters stay clean. Here, you can find whores, chem, contraband, and wicked music.</p><p>During my academy days, I spent as much time as I could out here, away from rules and regulations. I even had a boyfriend, an insanely gifted sax player named Sebastian, who called me a stroppy little bitch. We fought and fucked and fought some more. In retrospect, it\u2019s a wonder I made it to graduation day.</p><p>The crunch of footsteps demands my attention, somehow ominous and stealthy. \u201cPut me down. It\u2019s better if I walk.\u201d</p><p>Maybe I was getting heavy anyway because he complies without protest. More likely, he figures he may soon need both hands to fight. March offers a nod as a group of hooded thugs step into our path.</p><p>The leader says, \u201cMaybe you didn\u2019t know, but this is a toll road. You need to pay us fifty credits each in order to use it.\u201d</p><p>First, it\u2019s not much of a road. I\u2019d call it an alley, myself. I can\u2019t help it; I\u2019ll die a smart-ass, maybe right here in this alley. \u201cIs that fifty credits from each of us or fifty credits to each of you? Or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, woman.\u201d March doesn\u2019t even glance at me. This better be manly posturing to impress the gangers, or he\u2019s sleeping alone for at least a week. Even that threatening thought doesn\u2019t rouse a reaction from him, though. \u201cHow about I beat the shit out of you, and we call it even?\u201d</p><p>Whoa, there are seven of them. He\u2019s sure feeling his oats after plunging ten meters off a doomed Skimmer. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be much help in a fight, and I don\u2019t have a weapon.</p><p>To my astonishment, the head man breaks down into a belly laugh. \u201cMarch, you rat bastard, how you been? We haven\u2019t seen you dirtside in at least five spins. I almost shat when I saw you on the vid.\u201d</p><p>While they exchange backslapping hugs all around, I relax muscles I hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019d tensed. Dammit, they all had me going. And now my hip really hurts because I slid into a fighting crouch out of reflex.</p><p>Men.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right, Surge. Except we find ourselves a bit disadvantaged in your territory. Our ride went down a ways back, and I have no idea where we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you out of the cold, catch up a bit, and then see what we can do about a lift home. Where is home these days?\u201d</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s the waning light, but March looks grim and weary. \u201cNowhere, now. I lost the Folly.\u201d</p><p>His pal shakes his head. \u201cRough luck, mate. Let me stand you one.\u201d</p><p>They lead us into a pub via the back door, ignoring the red-faced woman who shouts at them. When Surge peels off his winter wraps, I decide he got his name because his wild, springy hair looks like he conducts large amounts of electricity as a hobby. I limp through into the common room, which is grimy, dimly lit, and full of mismatched furniture.</p><p>Ah, home. I might\u2019ve been here with Sebastian, fifteen years ago.</p><p>Once we settle at a sticky table, I find out they aren\u2019t gangers at all but guys March knew in the old days. From what I can gather, they fought together on Nicu Tertius. Mercenaries go wherever they get paid best, and the Nicuan Empire is always in turmoil, so much that half the time they can\u2019t even participate in galactic politics.</p><p>By the time the server puts a mug of hot tea in my hand, I don\u2019t care whether the cup is clean. I sip and listen while they catch up. Apparently Surge and his boys are working salvage at the moment; they got tired of fighting other people\u2019swars. Someone named Buzzkill died in the last insurrection, and that\u2019s when they called it a day.</p><p>\u201cIs there a bounce-relay anywhere in this dump?\u201d March asks.</p><p>His friend points to the far wall. The thing is positively ancient, dates back before the Axis Wars. It doesn\u2019t even have a card reader; you key in your digits by hand.</p><p>\u201cLet me send a message to Keri. That was one of our goals today, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cMake sure she got the data, as Tarn claims.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t flash your cred too wide around here,\u201d Surge cautions.</p><p>March\u2019s gesture says Surge and I are both nervous old women. Well, he\u2019s got that half-right. A few minutes later, he returns, looking satisfied. \u201cShe should have it in ten to twelve hours, so we\u2019ll hear back by early morning.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019ll have to do. Tarn will want my decision then, but I\u2019m not making it unless I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t need me on Lachion.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the story with Tarn?\u201d March takes a seat and picks at a plate of fried . . . something. You\u2019d think I would be used to the way he follows my thoughts by now, but it always seems a little bit eerie. Just like the first time.</p><p>Surge shrugs. I can\u2019t remember the names of all his guys, which is fine, because they\u2019re drinking at other tables now. One of them watches me out of narrowed icy blue eyes. He\u2019s a pretty one, if a little grimy around the edges, and I\u2019m not sure what has him so interested. Maybe he\u2019s never seen a bald chick before.</p><p>\u201cHe was a nobody before last week,\u201d Surge says. \u201cNow he\u2019s pushing to make New Terra the Conglomerate capital, and the fact that Farwan fell apart here is lending him some momentum, but as far as I can tell, he has no more power than any other representative.\u201d</p><p>Our waitress sets a carafe down at my elbow. I sniff it. The fumes decree that it\u2019s extremely alcoholic, so I tip some into my weak tea. There\u2019s probably a still in the basement. In Wickville they make the homebrew out of whatever they have to hand. Hopefully, it will take the edge off the pain. Medicinal usage aside, if I drink enough of this brown lightning, I won\u2019t care about my hip anymore.</p><p>Some things never change. In poor districts, people do the jobs that bots perform in more affluent sectors. Here, the owners can\u2019t afford maintenance, replacement parts, or chip upgrades. Humans are infinitely more expendable. If a woman wears out, you can find twenty more just like her looking for work. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The one working our table looks pretty close to busted. As if she feels my stare, she meets my eyes, but she doesn\u2019t have enough spark left in her to mind. Her gaze slides away from mine as she trudges on back to the kitchen to schlep the next tray.</p><p>March drums his fingers, looking thoughtful. \u201cHe\u2019s ambitious then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m his cat\u2019s-paw.\u201d The guys glance at me in surprise, as if they\u2019ve forgotten about me. We can\u2019t have that, can we? \u201cWhat else is new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou certainly have a history of finding trouble,\u201d Surge says.</p> <p>Annoyance sparks through me. This prick doesn\u2019t know the first thing about me, other than what he\u2019s read or seen on the vids. And okay, maybe things tend to unravel at the seams wherever I go, but is that my fault?</p><p>\u201cLay off her,\u201d March says. He\u2019s smiling, and his tone remains deceptively gentle. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to make her mad.\u201d</p><p>I liked how he began, but now I\u2019m not sure where he\u2019s going with this. If he expects me to put on a show\u2014You know, honey, do bitchy Jax for my buddies, come on!\u2014 well, that\u2019s just not happening. I\u2019m too tired.</p><p>Surge regards me with bloodshot eyes, a forest bristling from his jaw. \u201cOh yeah? Why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if you upset her, you\u2019ll have to deal with me. And I don\u2019t think you want that.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re in no position to pick a fight with the people who are helping us. Then again, I suspect I don\u2019t get the whole guy thing, because Surge cracks up again. Fucking men, right?</p><p>\u201cShit, she\u2019s got you trained right and tight, lad. When you donning the collar?\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, I down the rest of my spiked tea and feel the warmth washing over me. It\u2019s been a while since I drank anything this strong.</p><p>\u201cJax doesn\u2019t believe in that,\u201d March answers.</p><p>\u201cI did once. It didn\u2019t work out.\u201d I scowl, thinking of Simon. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you know people who could get to him? He\u2019s being held in a secure facility.\u201d It\u2019s a throwaway remark, one I don\u2019t expect to bear fruit. I should have known better. These are former mercs, after all.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a way,\u201d Surge tells me with a wicked smile. \u201cBut it\u2019ll cost. Depends on where, of course, but we probably know someone doing time same as your ex. How bad do you want the man done?\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>l\u2019d love to see Simon dead.</p><p>When his superiors asked for a scapegoat, he tried to sacrifice me. He knew they planned to murder everyone on the Sargasso, and he decided to rid himself of me as well. There were probably insurance payments to collect, my death benefits. Mary knows he cleaned out my personal accounts before my alleged body was cold.</p><p>He deserves to suffer in ways I can\u2019t articulate for what he\u2019s done. Seventy-five souls trusted us to get them safely to Matins IV. Eighty-two died in the crash.</p><p>Even now, I still have dreams. I wake up screaming, and I can\u2019t stand the smell of cooking meat. March watches me thinking it over, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s tapped into my blood-thirsty thoughts. Then it occurs to me. Doesn\u2019t matter how bad I\u2019d like to get this dirty job done. I can\u2019t afford it.</p><p>I\u2019ll have to content myself with imagining bad things happening to the bastard. If he\u2019s been sent to Whitefish, I won\u2019t have to wait long, though. Someone will shank him for being an officious little prick.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d I say, because there\u2019s no way I\u2019m telling Surge about my temporary financial embarrassment.</p><p>The merc looks disappointed. \u201cRight, then. Another round?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne for the road,\u201d March answers. His expression becomes speculative. \u201cWhat would you suggest for someone in deep to the Syndicate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Eutha-booth.\u201d Luckily, the other man has his eye on March while he laughs, so he doesn\u2019t catch my wince. There are home truths, and home truths, if you know what I mean. \u201cOh shit, you\u2019re serious? Dunno, lad, that\u2019s some steep ground. They were fighting a smugglers\u2019 war on two fronts between Hon\u2019s raiders and the gray men, but the world looks a whole lot rosier for them now, thanks to your girl here. Maybe she could ask them nicely to call off the debt.\u201d</p><p>Well, that\u2019s not helpful. Mr. Jewel Brooch didn\u2019t seem inclined to believe he owed me any favors when we talked at the coffeehouse. Was that just a few hours ago? Long day.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll sort it out.\u201d March pushes away from the table. \u201cCan you call us an auto-cab? Where\u2019s the closest stand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the corner,\u201d Surge says. \u201cAnd already done. Should be there by the time you make your way down. It was good seeing you, mate. I hope you and the ambassador here get things sorted.\u201d</p><p>Every time someone says that, I fight the urge to look over my shoulder. It\u2019s like being the butt of a joke everybody gets but me. I sure as shit don\u2019t feel like any such thing. Maybe it takes a while to sink in.</p><p>From the next table I hear Surge\u2019s guys speculating that I\u2019m bald because I had a terrible case of nits. I run a hand over my stubbly head and struggle to my feet. Yeah, it\u2019s definitely time to go.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some wreckage four blocks up and over from where we met you. You should get a good price for the big pieces if you get right over there.\u201d With a wave, March heads for the front door with me trailing behind him like a gimp puppy.</p><p>I guess diva-Jax still dwells somewhere inside my scrawny breast because that doesn\u2019t set well. Then he holds the door for me and offers his heart-melting smile. As we step outside, I forget my minor complaints because night-fall in the north is fucking brutal.</p><p>Our hike down to the auto-cab stand feels like kilometers. There\u2019s a reason people drink so much, living here. I\u2019d nearly forgotten that part. A group of homeless men huddle near a trash barrel where they\u2019ve lit a fire. Such things are illegal, but who\u2019s going to protest?</p><p>The Corp wrote this place off decades ago, and gangers run it now. Starving artists produce the most amazing music, though. Sweet strains wend through the smoky dark toward me, notes of throbbing warmth that seem to hang in the crystal-cold air like tropical fruit. People in Wickville live with singular abandon; it\u2019s not hard to behave as if every day might be your last if it truly might be. Until now, I hadn\u2019t realized how much I\u2019d incorporated that idea into my personal philosophy, if I could be said to have such a thing.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize how much time you spent here,\u201d March says softly.</p><p>I make no response as we climb into the blessedly heated cab. He doesn\u2019t know as much about me as he supposes. I wonder what he\u2019d say if he knew I almost threw everything away\u2014my future with the Corp, my promise as a jumper\u2014for a saxophone player.</p><p>First he swipes his card and then taps out our destination on the panel. With a soft swoosh, we\u2019re on our way.</p><p>Numbness sets in. Not from the cold, though I can\u2019t seem to warm up all the way. Too much has happened. I can\u2019t parse it all.</p><p>My mother, my father, my past . . .</p><p>Everything feels like it\u2019s on a collision course. No matter what choice I make, somebody loses. In the old days I wouldn\u2019t have cared. Fuck the lot of them; what did they ever do for me? I\u2019d have gotten drunk, flashed my tits, and danced on a table. I\u2019d have thought of nothing but my next jump. For Mary\u2019s sake, these days, I even regret the trouble the exploding Skimmer will cause poor Squid.</p><p>When the hell did I develop a conscience?</p><p>\u201cWhen you came for me.\u201d March answers the unspoken question with an expression I can\u2019t interpret.</p><p>There\u2019s something to be said for a man who tunes into your moods like this. He wraps an arm around me and leans his head against mine. Sometimes I sense in him a deep-seated fear. It\u2019s like he wants to hold me so tight I can\u2019t get free, but conversely, he\u2019s afraid of frightening me away with such visceral need.</p><p>He\u2019s right to fear that. I love him, but he terrifies me in some ways.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet used to it,\u201d he says dryly. \u201cOnce you start caring, it\u2019s hard to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>We ride the rest of the way in silence. I feel a little queasy from the homebrew, or maybe it was the microorganisms in my tea. By the time we climb out in front of headquarters, I\u2019m grateful for the shock of frosty air. Wickville seems farther away than the kilometers we traveled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you to your door.\u201d In his eyes, I glimpse an endearingly roguish twinkle that warns me he doesn\u2019t intend to leave me there with a chaste kiss.</p><p>I\u2019m not in the mood for love, but I\u2019ll deal with that when the time comes. We\u2019re questioned once by the automated security system. Luckily March remembers the pass codes. To my mind, modern life just offers too many numbers that we\u2019re supposed to keep track of.</p><p>Up on the eighth floor, I key my room open and stare. \u201cWhat the fuck . . .\u201d</p><p>The place has been ransacked, well, as much as an impersonal, nearly empty room can be. I don\u2019t have anything. Anyone who doesn\u2019t realize that is dumb as a rock. Correction, March gave me back my PA, 245, which he found at the hostel where Velith took me.</p><p>She is literally all I own, and I keep her with me at all times now. Discovering that I\u2019m dead broke makes her all the more valuable. Since she has perfect recall, she\u2019ll make an ideal assistant for an ambassador who needs to get everything just right from customs to mealtime etiquette. Just last night, she asked me to get her a droid frame, so she can better serve in that capacity.</p><p>So she\u2019s my most important asset. I\u2019m like the tinker and his horseshoe nail from the stories. Numbly I step inside and start tidying up.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we call security? They might be able to find out who did this.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cIf you like. I don\u2019t feel up to dealing with it tonight, though.\u201d</p><p>He takes a closer look at me. \u201cYou don\u2019t look good, Jax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. You\u2019re fantastic for my ego.\u201d I manage a wan smile. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long day, and dropping out of the sky didn\u2019t help. I\u2019ll be fine after I get some rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope so.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s because I know him, but he\u2019s not doing a good job of hiding his concern.</p><p>I understand why. This isn\u2019t like me. I\u2019m not the pale, listless type, and I can count on one hand the number of times I\u2019ve been sick in my life.</p><p>\u201cYou want to stay?\u201d Even as I ask, I press the button to enlarge my bunk from a single to a double.</p><p>We\u2019ve been assigned to executive quarters, so I have a san-shower in the suite, a vid station, and a customizable sleep unit. The only thing we don\u2019t have is a wardrober, but the Corp was run by a bunch of skinflints. March has his own room on ten, but I don\u2019t imagine he\u2019ll be returning to it. He smiles at me and hangs his things next to my winter gear. It doesn\u2019t take long to set the room to rights, given how little I have in here. Nothing seems to be missing.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d ask,\u201d he says. \u201cShower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, let\u2019s.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe things will look better in the morning.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>l\u2019m having the strangest dream.</p><p>Dina sits on my chest while trying to convince someone I\u2019m part of an expensive rug she wants to sell. Vaguely I know this isn\u2019t right. I\u2019m not made of loose threads and badly woven s-wool. Am I? When I wake up, I find myself snuggled against March\u2019s big body while Dina peers into my face. As always, I\u2019m surprised that she smells of flowers.</p> <p>\u201cI got us a ship,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d The neurons in my brain aren\u2019t firing at capacity yet.</p><p>\u201cA ship,\u201d she repeats, slower this time. Like I\u2019m a head case. Since I need a chemical boost to jump-start my wits, she probably has a point.</p><p>March is awake now, and thankfully, he heaves over so I can crawl out of bed. Damn, I ache. Guess I\u2019m not as young as I used to be . . . so I can\u2019t fall out of the sky with equanimity. I wish Doc was here. He\u2019d give me a shot of something and say, You\u2019re fine, Jax. Get out of my med bay.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you manage that?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>Maybe she doesn\u2019t think I notice the way she averts her eyes, but I do. In utter exhaustion I fell into bed in my skivvies last night. This morning, she\u2019s caught me in a tank top and shorts, revealing my scars in all their glory. They\u2019re never going to fade entirely. I don\u2019t even want them to, so it\u2019s just as well March can handle them. I\u2019ll never go to a cosmetic surgeon and ask him to burn away the marks.</p><p>\u201cWon it,\u201d she answers. This means she hustled someone, the poor bastard. \u201cIn a magnificent hand of Pick Five. I spent the night going over it. I\u2019m dog tired now, but she\u2019ll run. And she\u2019s ours. You can rename her when I handle ownership transfer. We\u2019ll just have to pay license and filing fees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it called now?\u201d I ask over my shoulder.</p><p>Since we showered last night, I don\u2019t feel dirty pulling on a fresh jumpsuit, straight from bed. When you don\u2019t have any hair to manage, it\u2019s amazing how fast you can be ready. I just need to wash my face, clean my teeth, and I\u2019ll be set.</p><p>Dina grins. \u201cBernard\u2019s Luck.\u201d</p><p>As I laugh at the irony, March wears a thoughtful frown as he gets dressed. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that somewhere before. Ah well, it\u2019ll come to me. Let\u2019s not rename it; I\u2019d rather not meddle with a man\u2019s luck.\u201d</p> <p>She raises a brow at me, and I shrug. He can be unaccountably superstitious for an otherwise reasonable man. Then again, with eyes like his, it wouldn\u2019t matter if he threw the bones before every flight.</p><p>Our station beeps, signaling we have a message. Through static and white solar lines, Keri says, \u201cWe\u2019ve received ten gigs\u2019 worth of genetic data, and it\u2019s advanced Doc\u2019s research by years. He arrived a week ago, and we\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>End message in a snowy gray blur. I suspect something must be the matter with the satellites near Lachion, or we wouldn\u2019t consistently have this problem with messages. Or maybe she was about to say something we weren\u2019t supposedto hear. Unfortunately, I have no ability to judge anymore.</p><p>If the Psychs can be trusted\u2014which they can\u2019t\u2014I suffer from borderline paranoid dysfunction. I suspect everyone of treachery and subversive plots against me. But like the old adage goes: Just because you\u2019re paranoid doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t out to get you. Why, then, do they want to send a half-cracked nut like me off to Ithiss-Tor? That question begs for an answer, but I don\u2019t have all the pieces of the puzzle just yet.</p><p>In under half an hour we present ourselves in conference room 7-J again. My hip still hurts, and I have my doubts about this whole endeavor, but when Tarn enters the room, I manage a smile. His expression alters subtly when he takes in my outfit.</p><p>\u201cIf you intend to take this position, Ms. Jax, you\u2019ll need to dress the part. We cannot have you representing New Terra looking like a garage mechanic.\u201d</p><p>This is my favorite blue jumpsuit, dammit.</p><p>I glare at him. \u201cAnd if you think I\u2019m donning ceremonial robes, you\u2019re out of your mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are interested then, I take it?\u201d</p><p>March and Dina regard me in silence. I think about all the factors, and in the end, it comes down to one thing. It\u2019s a job that gets me off this rock, at least for a little while. I\u2019ll be jumping again, all expenses paid. Plus, I\u2019ve never been one to back away from a challenge.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m interested. I\u2019ll dress up more when we arrive.\u201d</p><p>Tarn smiles. Oh, I really don\u2019t trust that look. \u201cExcellent.\u201d He depresses a button under the table, and the door to the conference room slides open.</p><p>I don\u2019t recognize the man who joins us then: medium height, brown hair, average features. In fact, if I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d say his face is some amalgamation of a thousand others I\u2019ve seen, so relentlessly average that I\u2019ve forgotten what he looks like as soon as my gaze shifts away.</p><p>I test this three or four times, bemused by it, so I\u2019m distracted when Tarn says, \u201cI believe you already know Velith. He\u2019ll be accompanying you as your cultural liaison. I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to stress the importance of internalizing Ithtorian customs to prevent giving insult and destroying our nascent accords. And above all, please take care with your jumps, Sirantha. There may be raiders lurking in highly traveled hot spots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVel!\u201d Though I know what lurks beneath the human skin, I can\u2019t resist. I leap from my chair and startle him with a hug. I never had the chance to thank him. There\u2019s no question; I wouldn\u2019t be here if not for him.</p><p>He fields me with awkward perplexity. \u201cIf I am to begin your lessons at present, Sirantha, this would be construed as an aggressive act on Ithiss-Tor.\u201d</p><p>Well, since I\u2019m not normally a touchy-feely person, I think we\u2019ll be okay. I nod, though, and make a mental note. No hugging of random Bugs.</p><p>\u201cThis is March, my pilot, and Dina, ship\u2019s mechanic.\u201d</p><p>They exchange polite words while Tarn observes us. What\u2019s he looking for? Something isn\u2019t right here, but I can\u2019t put my finger on it.</p><p>I\u2019m all but certain Vel isn\u2019t in on it, whatever the Chancellor is plotting. What was the point of saving me if he only meant to take me to his homeworld and get me killed? Logically, it just doesn\u2019t track, and Vel is all about things making sense.</p><p>\u201cWhen do we leave?\u201d Dina asks. \u201cI have some preparations to make.\u201d</p><p>Tarn raises a brow at her. Oh, she\u2019s gonna go all \u201cher highness\u201d on his ass. \u201cYour vessel is already adequately supplied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t touch that \u2018vessel\u2019 with a ten-foot pole,\u201d she says, eyes narrowed. If her chin juts out, he\u2019d better run. \u201cWe have our own ship, and I trust you\u2019ll approve all necessary expenditures to equip it as the ambassador\u2019s team sees fit.\u201d</p><p>Before the veins in Tarn\u2019s forehead explode, March puts in, \u201cWe prefer not to trust our fate to those inexperienced with long jump-flights.\u201d Chalk one up for diplomacy. \u201cHowever well-intentioned they may be. I hope you understand.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe this ambassador stuff works, even on the Chancellor. He\u2019s the one who appointed me. But I suppose once you claim someone has power, you can\u2019t decry it without making yourself look like a jackass.</p><p>Clearing his throat, Tarn makes an attempt to regain some lost ground. \u201cI\u2019ll approve the same budget for your provisions as were spent on the Conglomerate ship. You may allot it as you choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we get under way tomorrow, Dina?\u201d March gets to his feet, signaling the meeting has adjourned. Tarn isn\u2019t going to like that either. As for me, I\u2019m still standing with Vel, near the door.</p><p>\u201cDepends. If their commissar can requisition everything we need, it\u2019ll be a snap. I\u2019m having Bernard\u2019s Luck transferred to the Conglomerate docking bays today.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cThat\u2019s your top priority then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t briefed you fully,\u201d Tarn protests, as we head for the door.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cSend the files to the ship. I\u2019ll read it en route.\u201d</p><p>If he expected me to be easily controlled, he didn\u2019t pay enough attention to recent history. I don\u2019t owe Chancellor Tarn a damn thing. He wants me to go to Ithiss-Tor and try to persuade the Bugs that it\u2019s in their best interests to join galactic politics. And that means I work for the Conglomerate, a glorified bureaucrat.</p><p>Whether it\u2019s best for Ithiss-Tor to join the party, I\u2019m not sure. If they refuse, I\u2019m positive the Conglomerate intends to make an example of them somehow, perhaps to frighten other non-tier worlds into towing the line. Tarn lost sight of one thing, however.</p><p>I\u2019m nobody\u2019s pawn, not anymore. And if he tries to orchestrate my moves on some celestial chessboard, he\u2019ll be sorry.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>Dina has to be kidding.</p><p>If the Folly\u2014the ship we crashed a couple weeks ago\u2014 looked better on the inside than I expected, well, my luck has turned. This vessel looks like something out of old vids; it\u2019s positively ancient. The outside promises a dirty, cramped interior, and I\u2019m not disappointed when I clamber through the hatch.</p><p>It\u2019s only a six-seater. I pass through a narrow corridor to the central hub. At least the safety equipment looks to be functional. From the hub, halls lead left and right. If this ship conforms to standard layouts, there will be three small bunk areas on either side. Straight ahead we have the cockpit. Since this junk bucket is so small, I rather doubt it possesses any extra amenities.</p><p>Bernard\u2019s Luck doesn\u2019t even boast a boarding ramp. Instead it has a pressure door on the side and a retractable ladder. I wouldn\u2019t put it past the former owner of this ship to have lost it on purpose. Okay, probably not\u2014he could\u2019ve gotten something for it from the scrap yards.</p><p>Dina interprets my expression correctly. \u201cI know she\u2019s a little rough around the edges, but the Folly wasn\u2019t a diamond when we got her. I\u2019ll polish her up as we go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little?\u201d I shake my head. \u201cAs a jumper, I always knew my odds of going out on board a ship were pretty high, but do you have to stack the deck like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d March says, then nearly loses his head to a dangling ceiling panel. Though I\u2019m not a mechanic, I feel pretty sure that ought to be soldered to the wall. He exercises remarkable restraint as he adds to Dina, \u201cYou might want to fix that before we get under way.\u201d</p><p>She hurries off to get her toolkit. As I head to check out the cockpit, Velith boards. I hear him say, \u201cIs this wise? Perhaps we ought to reconsider and accept the loan of a Conglomerate ship.\u201d</p><p>Though I hate the idea of being dependent on charity as much as the next person, I have to say, I\u2019m with Vel on this one. Sadly, I\u2019m not surprised when both Dina and March call, \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is quite . . . compact, is it not?\u201d Vel glances around.</p><p>He has a point since five steps takes me around the hub. Another five steps carries me to the pressure hatch. I take a quick look around, and damned if crew quarters aren\u2019t so cramped that passing gas in there might result in methane poisoning. There\u2019s no med bay on board, just a maintenance closet, so it\u2019s just as well Doc won\u2019t be traveling with us this time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Halfway to the cockpit, the metal panels appear singed, as if there\u2019s been a fire. Mary help us. \u201cDina!\u201d I call. \u201cDid you check electrical?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to fix this thing? Of course I did. It\u2019s sound. I already told you that. That\u2019s purely a cosmetic flaw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the obsession with this piece of junk anyway?\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cIf we decide to leave Ithiss-Tor unexpectedly, we can\u2019t be accused of theft by the Conglomerate,\u201d March answers from behind me.</p> <p>After considering everything that could go wrong, I have to say, \u201cI see the value in that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might. Let\u2019s take a look at the cockpit.\u201d</p><p>Right. We continue to the front, where I intend to inspect the nav chair. That\u2019s life or death for me. If it doesn\u2019t look right, I\u2019m not going up in this, no matter what. I can live with being accused of theft. In fact, that might make a nice change from mass murder and general, wanton acts of terrorism.</p><p>I\u2019m pleasantly surprised to find a relatively clean environment. The newest pieces on the ship have been installed up here, no signs of systems failure, no loose wiring. The nav chair is an older model, but it looks like it\u2019s in good shape. After checking the port, I don\u2019t doubt this ship will run.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it look in your end?\u201d</p> <p>March shrugs. \u201cOld interface, but I can manage. We\u2019ll be all right, Jax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re stopping on Lachion first, right?\u201d He said something about it last night, but honestly I was half-asleep. \u201cIs that Conglomerate approved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d He grins at me and runs a hand over my stubbly head. \u201cWe know our message went out clean, but I\u2019m not so sure about Keri\u2019s. I just want to make sure everything\u2019s all right. I owe her that much.\u201d</p><p>I am absolutely not jealous over his concern. It\u2019s paternal, that\u2019s all. So what if Keri is young, lovely, talented, and terribly important? For a moment, I remember how much I resented her at our first meeting.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about paternal,\u201d March says, tormenting me with a thoughtful pause. \u201cFraternal. I\u2019m not that old.\u201d</p><p>Before I can hit him in the head as he so richly deserves, the sound of raised voices echoes toward us. The acoustics in here are such that I can\u2019t make out what the fuss is about, so I head back toward the hub. March\u2019s friend Surge towers over Dina, looking ready to clobber her.</p> <p>\u201cYou cheated!\u201d Surge roars. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m letting you take my ship\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ship,\u201d she corrects. \u201cI have all the documentation, and you better get your smelly ass off of it before we take you up and boost you out the garbage chute.\u201d</p><p>I register March\u2019s amusement as he comes up behind me. Funny, he hasn\u2019t made a sound, but I can feel his smile. Wonder if this sensitivity results from jacking in with a Psi pilot.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve met Dina. I knew I\u2019d heard that ship name somewhere. She rolled you in a game of Pick Five, huh? You must\u2019ve been pretty drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a little,\u201d Surge admits. \u201cI didn\u2019t even realize what I wagered till this mornin\u2019. Talk about a rude awakening. Now my crew\u2019s stranded here.\u201d</p><p>Dina snorts. \u201cServes them right for signing on with a scruffy, shamefaced mash-brain like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave us here,\u201d Surge protests. \u201cLet us ship out with you. You could use an extra pilot and jumper to spell you, right? And my guys won\u2019t eat much.\u201d His tone turns wheedling. \u201cCome on, mate, it\u2019ll be like old times.\u201d</p><p>There are seven of them and four of us. Even with March and me in the cockpit, that leaves a shortage of safety seats in the hub, and I doubt anyone is going to volunteer to have his brain scrambled. Staying on New Terra isn\u2019t that bad.</p> <p>By his expression, March is thinking along the same lines. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry you gambled away your ship, Bernard.\u201d He does sound sympathetic. \u201cBut she won\u2019t carry twelve. I can take three of you: pilot, jumper, plus one more. The rest of your crew stays dirtside. We\u2019re on a diplomatic mission, but we\u2019re stopping on Lachion first, so I can take you that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe might be able to find work with one of the clans,\u201d Surge says with a sigh. \u201cRight, then. Done. I\u2019ll call my boy, Jael, and our jumper, Koratati. It\u2019s rather urgent for her to get off world. She\u2019s nonhuman, doesn\u2019t have a valid visa. I expect you\u2019ve heard about the new Conglomerate immigration laws?\u201d</p><p>I haven\u2019t, actually, but Velith has. \u201cYes, it shall likely prove difficult to move about once they enforce them.\u201d</p><p>March shakes his head. \u201cThat\u2019s one way to enforce the status quo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey really want to get a lock on things, don\u2019t they?\u201d With a sigh, Dina fastens a tool belt around her waist. \u201cI\u2019m just afraid it\u2019s going to backfire, like it did on Tarnus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeriods of political upheaval are often accompanied by widespread disorder and lawlessness,\u201d Vel observes.</p><p>\u201cIt used to be confined to the Outskirts,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd Corp patrols kept the tier worlds safe. You think the Conglomerate\u2019s organized enough to prevent piracy and smuggling from becoming widespread?\u201d</p><p>We all exchange a dubious glance.</p><p>\u201cIf nothing else, they can make life difficult for folks on the tier worlds,\u201d Surge answers at last. \u201cAs for the wider reaches, I doubt it. It\u2019s gonna be every man for himself out there for a while yet. I\u2019d put money on the Syndicate running things before the Conglomerate gets itself sorted.\u201d</p><p>Sadly, nobody disputes his assessment.</p><p>\u201cPick your bunks, people. Surge, I want your other two on board in under an hour. We\u2019re taking off in seventy, hell or high water.\u201d Now that\u2019s the March I know and love.</p><p>I throw my meager possessions into a miniscule room at random and then return to the cockpit. March is already running diagnostics, a pretty array of lights glimmering on the instrument panel. I even know what some of them mean now, and I prove it by saying, \u201cIsn\u2019t that reading a little low for life support?\u201d</p><p>He grins like he\u2019s proud of me. \u201cYeah, give it some time to power up all the way. This ship won\u2019t be doing any lightning-fast getaways in its current state. Give Dina some time with it on Lachion, though. She\u2019ll upgrade, add all the pretty bells and whistles you admired on the Folly.\u201d</p><p>I check the port one last time. \u201cSo what do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurge isn\u2019t telling us something,\u201d March says. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t get a read on what. I\u2019ll be watching him, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>I raise a brow. \u201cI thought he was a friend of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore accurate to say, we belonged to the same companyat one time. He\u2019s doing his best to appear affable, but I think there\u2019s more to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he lost the ship to Dina on purpose, so he\u2019d have a reason to attach himself to us?\u201d There goes my paranoia again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t discount it.\u201d March wears a thundercloud scowl, long fingers dancing over the instrument panel. \u201cNever forget, he\u2019s a merc at heart, and he doesn\u2019t own an ounce of sentiment. He goes for the biggest payday, every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think he\u2019s out to get us, why is he on board this ship?\u201d I ask. Seems like a basic error in judgment.</p><p>\u201cI prefer to keep my enemies close enough that I can go for their throats.\u201d By his grim expression, he\u2019s remembering something he\u2019d rather not discuss.</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>lt feels good to be in the chair again.</p><p>We\u2019ve finished diagnostics and everyone\u2019s on board. Jael is a handsome, cocky bastard. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s good for on a ship, but he makes fine eye candy. And he\u2019s just the type I used to love: slim, blond, and too pretty for his own good. The way I look now, though, he spends his time flirting with Dina. He\u2019s more likely to get blood from a stone than make headway with her.</p><p>That stings my feminine vanity a little. I used to be able to command a man\u2019s attention by walking into a room. I had an indefinable something.</p><p>Now I\u2019m damaged goods, but it\u2019s enough that March loves me. I don\u2019t care if some stupid space cowboy can\u2019t appreciate what\u2019s beneath the surface.</p><p>Koratati is . . . big. She arrived swathed in a gray cloak, and I didn\u2019t get a good look at her before we came up front. We know she\u2019s nonhuman, so she might be one of the jumbo races. Surge did right to get her off planet, as hiding her wouldn\u2019t prove an easy task in Wickville. Hopefully, she can wedge her ass into the safety harness when we need to make the jump.</p><p>March contacts docking control on the relay, which crackles in a tinny, old-fashioned way. After a few minutes, they respond, \u201cYou have clearance, Bernard\u2019s Luck. Have a good flight.\u201d</p><p>Over the rush of the thrusters, I hear the hangar doors groan their way open. On some planets, the shipyards are out in the open, but it\u2019s too cold for that in this part of New Terra. The subzero temps would damage the instruments if we didn\u2019t keep the ships inside a climate-controlled hangar.</p><p>As always, I admire March\u2019s skill on the controls, the smooth way we swoop out into the sky. I know from experience, that isn\u2019t as easy as it looks. As we gain altitude, I feel it in my eardrums before the pressure inside the ship stabilizes.</p><p>The little Luck shudders as we push past the atmosphere and into stark, silent reaches where I feel most at home. There\u2019s nothing like seeing stars through the sensor screen and knowing only a few centimeters of metal separate you from vacuum. Just thinking about it sends a thrill through me.</p><p>March shakes his head at me, I hope with affection. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy, Jax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s said so. I could counter that he\u2019s mad for loving me, but that might make him question it. And I don\u2019t want that, even though I\u2019m afraid of hurting him, afraid of losing him.</p><p>Afraid of damn near everything.</p><p>But I refuse to let it paralyze me. I won\u2019t be the woman who cowers behind four walls, never taking chances. I want to die like I\u2019ve lived. I always wanted to be larger than life, but lately it feels like I\u2019m shrinking\u2014literally, like old women do.</p><p>March cuts me a sharp look\u2014he hates when I think about dying. He says it\u2019s macabre. Well, the subsequent thought should make him smile because I\u2019m not ready to go anytime soon, not until I\u2019ve seen more, done more. After this is all over, we\u2019ll spend a glorious week on the beaches of New Venice, maybe luge down the glaciers on Ielos. There\u2019s too much left to do for me to want the ride to end so soon.</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it,\u201d he says softly. \u201cI\u2019d miss you.\u201d</p><p>Understatement. I have no words for the holocaust I saw inside him when he thought he\u2019d lost me. He went to a place beyond loss, beyond madness. I don\u2019t deserve him. But I put aside those thoughts because they make me ache.</p><p>He seems a little tense. The last time March and I left the cockpit, the Folly wound up targeted by New Terra\u2019s Satellite Defense Installations, and we were lucky to reach the surface in one piece. I don\u2019t blame him for wanting to make sure we make it to the first jump intact. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Moreover, we can\u2019t trust everyone we have on board, so if we leave the cockpit, there\u2019s a chance that Koratati and Surge will hijack us and deliver us someplace we don\u2019t want to be. I can\u2019t imagine who else might be gunning for me\u2014or maybe it\u2019s March they want this time\u2014his past is far from an open book at this point. Regardless, it seems better to be safe, which means keeping our asses in these seats.</p><p>Dina and Velith will keep an eye on Surge, Jael, and Koratati for us. And if they start something, my money\u2019s on Vel. See, I watched him take on a clutch of Morgut and walk\u2014okay, limp\u2014off to tell the tale.</p><p>My fingers go to my newest scar, a slash across my right wrist. Though it\u2019s healing well enough, it still itches a little.</p><p>March slants me a smile. \u201cSo . . . you wanna play Pick Five?\u201d</p> <p>I roll my eyes. \u201cNot really. You\u2019d just read my cards and know what you needed to discard.\u201d</p><p>He lays a hand over his heart. \u201cI\u2019m cut, seriously. You\u2019re implying I\u2019d cheat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>His expression becomes wolfish. \u201cAbsolutely. I always get what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould that worry me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEverything worries you.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t argue that. He must find me the most ridiculous bundle of contradictions. I suspect everyone of perfidious motives yet I long to hurl myself into dangerous situations to forget my fears. Forget aversion therapy, that\u2019s the way I live.</p><p>Apart from the noises of the ship, it\u2019s so quiet up here. This is what freedom feels like. In some ways that\u2019s an oxymoron\u2014I\u2019m only free when I\u2019m confined to a ship as opposed to having a whole planet to move around on. But there you have it; it\u2019s how I\u2019ve felt since the first time I went up. My parents took me on a pleasure cruise when I was thirteen, and I was never the same thereafter.</p><p>That line of thought leads me directly back to my mother. I can\u2019t believe she expects me to save her ass, after they disowned me. They probably celebrated when they heard Farwan \u201cbrought me to justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d March says, unaccountably gentle. \u201cShe was happy to see you. More worried about herself, but genuinely glad you\u2019re all right.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cUgh. Don\u2019t we have enough to worry about without you analyzing my feelings about my mother?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have time to kill before we make the jump.\u201d He grins.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather play Charm, New Venice rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect you would. But think how shocked people would be to find us sexing each other up in the cockpit, just like the porn clich\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>A smile tugs at the corner of my mouth, but I won\u2019t give him the satisfaction. \u201cYou saying you can\u2019t see me naked without being overcome with lust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>I suspect he\u2019s full of shit, but damned if he\u2019s not good for my ego, which has taken a beating lately. Most days I don\u2019t even feel womanly, let alone sexy.</p><p>\u201cI think we better not,\u201d I answer finally. \u201cI don\u2019t want to scare anybody.\u201d</p><p>Mainly I\u2019m glad he\u2019s not bugging me about my mother anymore. That\u2019s where it\u2019s a little unequal. He knows exactly what he can say without tearing open old wounds. I don\u2019t have any such clarity where he\u2019s concerned.</p> <p>Of course I\u2019m curious about the shit he\u2019s done, the battles he\u2019s fought, and the hell he went through before he wound up on Lachion with Mair, Keri\u2019s grandmother. But I don\u2019t want to hurt him\u2014I don\u2019t want to ask about stuff he\u2019s trying to forget. The old Jax would\u2019ve ranked her curiosity above any possible harm and called it candor. I\u2019ve since learned there\u2019s a balance between candor and cruelty.</p><p>\u201cYou can ask me anything you want to know,\u201d he says without looking up from the instruments. His playful mood has faded, though, as if in anticipation of what I may say.</p><p>Okay, then. This is an olive branch, so I take it. Maybe he wants to open up, but he doesn\u2019t know where to start. \u201cHow many, March?\u201d</p><p>He answers without looking at me. \u201cBody count, you mean?\u201d</p><p>I nod, knowing he\u2019ll catch the movement in his peripheral vision.</p><p>\u201cThousands,\u201d he says, after a long pause. \u201cOn Nicu Tertius alone. I did the job they hired me for, no matter how bad it got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was war. That\u2019s . . . different. And it\u2019s not what I wanted to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to know how many men I\u2019ve personally ended?\u201d he asks then.</p><p>Do I?</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetween ten and fifteen.\u201d He sounds dispassionate. \u201cDepends on whether the ones whose minds I broke are still lingering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you had good reason, right?\u201d</p><p>Before he can reply, Dina\u2019s voice comes over the comm. \u201cI think we have trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen don\u2019t we?\u201d March mutters. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir jumper seems to be having a fit, and we don\u2019t have a doc on board.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>l put aside my misgivings about the man March used to be. People can change; I\u2019m living proof of that. \u201cYou want me to take a look?\u201d</p><p>March manages a smile. \u201cUnless you want to drive.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m just never going to hear the end of that. When we made our escape from Hon-Durren\u2019s Kingdom, I banged the hell out of the Folly. Shaking my head, I push out of the nav chair and make my way back to the hub. Koratati flails uncontrollably, but she\u2019s still wrapped up in that heavy cloak, so I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s going on.</p><p>Surge looks frantic, Jael appears unconcerned, and Vel . . . he\u2019s observing the scene, putting the pieces together before he makes a judgment. Dina has made herself scarce. I guess she figured she discharged her duty when she notified March.</p><p>\u201cHas she been sick? You idiots, we don\u2019t have facilities on this ship. She\u2019d have been better off dirtside, new immigration laws or not.\u201d I bend toward her, and Koratati lashes out.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d</p><p>Her fist feels like a hammer as it connects with my cheek. I reel back, steady myself on the wall. That\u2019s gonna leave a mark.</p><p>Under her voluminous robe, something . . . moves. Okay, this really isn\u2019t right. I wish Doc was here.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not ill,\u201d Velith says while I rub my cheek. \u201cShe\u2019s in labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to get her off world.\u201d Surge paces around the hub, watching Koratati with a worry that tells me she\u2019s not just his jumper. \u201cShe\u2019s not due for days yet, though\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cImbecile.\u201d Even I know that stress can jump-start this breeding business, and I\u2019m not exactly an expert. \u201cYou know we can\u2019t jump, right? Did you even consider what the pressure and/or environmental shifts could do to an unborn child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . no.\u201d Surge shakes his head. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want my kid to suffer or be treated like a second-class citizen because of those new immigration laws. At least if he\u2019s born up here, they don\u2019t apply.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe!\u201d Koratati pushes her way out of the cloak. She has a jutting jaw, a fine dusting of gold fur, and powerful haunches. Mary help us, she\u2019s Rodeisian. Wait, his kid? I didn\u2019t even know they could crossbreed with humans. They\u2019re a large, humanoid race from a small planet in the Outskirts.</p><p>\u201cYou knew you needed to get off the planet in a hurry, and you gambled away your ship?\u201d That makes no sense.</p><p>The woman\u2019s scream of pain derails my train of thought. We need medicine, a doctor, somewhere she can lie down\u2014</p><p>Shit, why am I in charge?</p><p>\u201cWhen they broke the news about the reforms, I didn\u2019t have the credits to provision the ship,\u201d Surge explains. \u201cOr even refuel it. Then I ran across you and March. Did some digging to see how it could help me, and when we saw your mechanic drinking in the Den . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw your chance and took it. Then you pushed your way on board, talked March into taking you up, and the rest is history.\u201d</p><p>Koratati screams again, and March\u2019s voice comes over the comm. \u201cWhat the hell is going on back there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt appears we\u2019re having a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re what?\u201d</p><p>I realize how that sounds, but unfortunately, I don\u2019t have time to tease him with it. \u201cSurge brought his wife on board, and she\u2019s about to deliver any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not his wife,\u201d Koratati grits out.</p><p>I don\u2019t know enough about Rodeisian customs to understand why she\u2019s so adamant on this point. Whatever, it doesn\u2019t matter. More to the point, what the hell am I supposed to do?</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you to one of the bunks where you can lie down.\u201d I try to help her up, but she shoves me away.</p><p>I stagger back, and Mary, either her adrenaline is running amok or she\u2019s the strongest woman I\u2019ve ever met. Dina isn\u2019t going to like that. I\u2019ve never sparred with a Rodeisian partner, but then again, most of my combat experience comes from being liquored up and starting something in a station bar.</p><p>\u201cThat will only make it harder,\u201d she grunts. \u201cI need to stay upright so gravity will help me.\u201d</p><p>Great, we need one of those old-fashioned birthing chairs. I glance around the hub and don\u2019t see anything better suited than the seat she\u2019s already sitting in. She can\u2019t have a baby here; this ship is old, filthy, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cVel, help me out here!\u201d</p><p>The bounty hunter turned cultural liaison lifts a brow at me, appearing completely at ease. \u201cWhat do you expect me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d Have no idea.</p><p>Thankfully March appears in the corridor leading from the cockpit. He\u2019ll take over, right? The man takes in my frantic expression and scrubs a palm across his face. \u201cYou were serious.\u201d Turning to Surge, he adds, \u201cYou smuggled a pregnant woman on board my ship? We\u2019re tied to hauling straight space now, and I don\u2019t know what kind of provisions Dina laid in. We expected a clean jump to Lachion!\u201d</p><p>As if responding to a summons, she appears with an armful of odds and ends. \u201cWe have enough organic to run the kitchen-mate for a week, if we eat light, enough paste to keep us going for another two weeks.\u201d</p><p>March mutters, \u201cFuck. All right, let me check the charts to see what our options are, given fuel and supply levels.\u201d He narrows his eyes on me. \u201cYou. That wasn\u2019t funny, not even a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like a refugee,\u201d Dina says while laying out the things she\u2019s collected.</p><p>To my vast relief, she handles the situation, spreading a blanket that I hope she\u2019s sterilized somehow beneath Koratati\u2019s feet. I don\u2019t even mind the slam, which stings more because it\u2019s true.</p><p>\u201cGive her your hand,\u201d Dina instructs.</p><p>After all the abuse I\u2019ve taken, I\u2019m not precisely eager, but I don\u2019t want to wind up orchestrating this comedy of errors. So Koratati squeezes down, and I\u2019m pretty sure I hear my bones popping. That can\u2019t be a good sign. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>From somewhere behind me, Jael says, \u201cIf we don\u2019t need to be strapped in, then I\u2019m off to quarters. I\u2019d rather not watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou prefer the baby-making, do you?\u201d I\u2019m amazed Koratati can find the wind to be flippant, but she manages to make an obscene gesture at Jael as he retreats. \u201cGo on then, get out of here, you gormless coward!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you insist.\u201d Surge pretends he thinks she\u2019s talking to him, heads for the hallway, and calls to Jael, \u201cSlow up, lad, maybe we can get a game together.\u201d</p><p>This looks insanely painful. If I\u2019d ever been inclined to romanticize motherhood, this would\u2019ve dispelled those illusions straightaway. Koratati\u2019s belly roils with her labor, and she sits forward, knees splayed wide. The golden fur running down her neck is wet with sweat. She smells funky, too. By the way Kora bares her teeth, it\u2019s just as well Surge took to his heels.</p> <p>A gush of fluid spatters the blanket Dina laid down. The mechanic whispers soft words of encouragement with a surety and comfort that astonishes me. She correctly interprets my surprise and shrugs.</p><p>\u201cBack on Tarnus, I was present at my mother\u2019s bedside for every birth. I had three sisters. It was tradition.\u201d</p><p>Her family is dead now. I wonder what she\u2019d do in my place, given what my mother has asked of me, what Dina would\u2019ve done to save them, if she\u2019d had any power in the matter. Koratati growls low in her throat, signaling that she should be the center of attention, as she crushes my fingers in hers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing great,\u201d Dina murmurs. \u201cI\u2019m timing you, and it\u2019s time to push.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s Vel\u2019s cue. Despite our racial differences, he\u2019s still quintessentially male, and this is a woman thing. I sigh.</p> <p>I wish I had a penis.</p><p>March\u2019s amusement ripples through me. Yeah, that\u2019s going on the list of things I never want to hear again. I grin, knowing I\u2019m not going to explain the context.</p><p>\u201cI think I will go see what they\u2019re playing,\u201d Vel says, and hurries off.</p><p>I\u2019d like to say the birth affected me profoundly, that it was beautiful and miraculous. Maybe even report the experience changed me forever. But that would come across as pure bullshit to anyone who knows me.</p><p>So I\u2019ll tell the truth: The ordeal struck me as painful, bloody, smelly, messy, and a whole lot of trouble. I can\u2019t believe women go through it on purpose. Kora looks positively beatific when we lay her daughter in her arms, though, a wrinkly, squalling little thing with tufts of gold hair. So I suppose she must think it\u2019s worth it.</p><p>As for me, I resolve never to pass along my genes. The guys return when the coast is clear, first Surge and Jael, then March and Vel. They admire the child dutifully and then break open a bottle of homebrew Surge brought on board. He knew he\u2019d have something to celebrate.</p> <p>The mood on board shifts from tense to festive, but I know it won\u2019t last. I can tell by March\u2019s expression he has crucial information, and we may not like it. Then again, when do we ever?</p><p>Like a good captain, he lets them celebrate for a while, though. Doesn\u2019t want to bring the mood down too soon. Dina coaxes some music out of the ancient comm system, and Jael shows off a surprisingly deep singing voice. Kora basks in Surge\u2019s proud fatherness. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever shared a moment like this with anyone.</p><p>Finally, March has to speak because time marches on, as that\u2019s what time does. I\u2019m shocked to find we\u2019ve been up hauling straight space for over twelve hours. \u201cI have bad news and worse news. Which do you want first?\u201d</p><p>Shit. I hate this game.</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>As the hub devolves into many voices talking at once, Vel takes a seat near me, where I\u2019ve collapsed. \u201cIs it always like this?\u201d</p><p>I think about that. \u201cPretty much. Except sometimes there\u2019s shooting and things blow up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it time,\u201d Dina mutters.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s have the worst news first,\u201d I suggest a little louder. \u201cMaybe the bad news won\u2019t seem so bad.\u201d</p><p>March motions for all of us to shut up. \u201cI\u2019ve looked at the routes, and we have two choices. We can go back to New Terra\u2014\u201d Jael immediately protests, and March tries to continue over the noise. \u201cOr we can make for an emergency station two weeks out. If we can\u2019t jump, there\u2019s just nowhere else in this sector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about the emergency station?\u201d I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one wondering that.</p><p>I stopped at a few in my Corp days. They\u2019re a little grim, true, with their bare-bones floor plans, and they offer only basic amenities, but I don\u2019t remember them as terrible places. We should be able to drop Surge and Koratati off there. They\u2019ll be able to work for their keep until another ride comes by.</p><p>It might be a while since most ships jump at the nearest beacon, six hours out of New Terra, but the kid needs to be old enough to don protective headgear anyway. Looks like she\u2019ll spend her first few turns on an emergency station. That\u2019s not the end of the world.</p><p>\u201cAccording to reports I pulled, Emry Station is full of Farwan loyalists. They don\u2019t care what the Corp did; they just want to preserve the status quo.\u201d</p><p>I raise both brows. \u201cYou mean they don\u2019t accept that it\u2019s over? There\u2019s no Corp left. Doesn\u2019t that technically make them rebels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you call them, they won\u2019t receive us politely. They\u2019re demanding the Conglomerate acknowledge them as an autonomous outpost, or they\u2019ll refuse to aid distressed ships in this sector.\u201d</p><p>That could be catastrophic. In time this area will turn into a graveyard, ghost ships floating, full of people who died from someone else\u2019s inaction. Add that to the already astronomical risk of being hit by raiders, well\u2014we can\u2019t let them get away with that.</p><p>This will put us off schedule, but we don\u2019t have a choice. In reflex, I curl my right hand into a fist, and the left tries to follow suit, but instead pain shoots all the way to my elbow. For a moment I see stars, and I\u2019m nowhere near the sensor screen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going back to New Terra,\u201d Jael says flatly. \u201cI\u2019ll kill you all before I let you turn this ship around.\u201d</p><p>Before March can respond to that, Vel glides to within a few meters of the man issuing such wild threats and examines him with a detached air. \u201cYou would try,\u201d he concludes. His ever-so-average appearance lends him menace that borders on spooky.</p><p>If I were Jael, I\u2019d step back. See, this young merc is just too pretty to be as dangerous as he thinks he is. You don\u2019t keep a face like that if you spend your life fighting. He\u2019d have a broken nose or something by now if he actually mixed it up. Instead I find it curious that he reacts so strongly to the possibility of going back. What\u2019s he running from? And is it going to hunt us down?</p><p>March poses that very question aloud as I frame it mentally. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s Psi or something. Oh, right.</p><p>Jael doesn\u2019t want to answer. It would be my luck to discover Pretty Boy was my mother\u2019s business partner, now running from the Syndicate. Possibly her former lover as well, as I doubt she\u2019s kept herself to an immaculate widowhood.</p><p>Mary. I\u2019ll never see my dad again. Ridiculous it should hit me so hard, right now. Maybe it\u2019s because of the baby. Once upon a time, before they took me on a ship, I used to be his little girl. He had high hopes for me. Sometimes I wonder what I\u2019d have been like if I hadn\u2019t discovered joy and freedom up here.</p><p>As much mind as she pays us, we might not even be here as far as Koratati is concerned. Her whole world rests in the crook of her arm. When she starts feeding the kid, I have to look away, and I intercept a meaningful exchange between Jael and Surge. It\u2019s almost like a lightning-fast argument, conducted silently, a glance, a couple of head shakes, and then:</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Bred,\u201d Surge explains, apparently against Jael\u2019s wishes. \u201cIf he stays dirtside, he\u2019ll be subject to discrimination, according to the new laws.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost like they\u2019re trying to force a caste system,\u201d Dina says thoughtfully.</p><p>Vel nods his agreement. \u201cIn a backward manner, it makes sense. While they are trying to engender a wider alliance with other races, hence the diplomatic missions, they also want to cement human privilege on the homeworld.\u201d</p><p>The tone of the new immigration and citizenship laws is downright xenophobic. Page seven, last paragraph restricts nonhumans from holding office and owning land. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be ugly for a while. We\u2019re better off up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with a baby aboard,\u201d March says. \u201cWe can\u2019t plod along forever in straight space, and we can\u2019t jump with her unprotected. I won\u2019t take the risk.\u201d</p><p>I study Jael. No wonder he\u2019s so pretty, and no wonder he doesn\u2019t want to go back. Normals hate his kind. Bred humans tend to be faster, smarter, healthier, and generally superior to their counterparts. With the reforms kicking in, it\u2019ll be worse.</p><p>\u201cOur best bet is to head for the emergency station,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd hope we can talk some sense into those idiots. Maybe they don\u2019t realize how isolated they are.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019re Farwan loyalists, not a military group. At best, they\u2019ll be former corporate wage slaves and disgruntled technicians. We should be able to cow them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s settled then. We haul onward.\u201d March reaches for me and tows me toward the quarters I picked out earlier.</p><p>I don\u2019t protest because I could use a break. Aching from head to toe, I follow him into the room he apparently intends to share with me. When the door shuts behind us, he draws me into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about you,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>Ordinarily I\u2019d discount that as pointless, but I haven\u2019t felt right for a while. Most likely I should\u2019ve had a checkup before we left, but I intended to have Doc check me out when we hit Lachion . . . I should\u2019ve known things never turn out the way we plan.</p><p>Wrapping my arms about his waist, I lean into him and close my eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong,\u201d I admit, low.</p><p>I haven\u2019t wanted to admit it, but I\u2019m not healing like I should. I\u2019m tired all the time, and sleep doesn\u2019t seem to help. I\u2019m no good at being sick, but I think I might be.</p><p>So gentle it makes my heart constrict, he presses me close for a moment, and then he steps back to look at my hand where Kora squeezed it. \u201cI think she snapped your fingers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d I wasn\u2019t kidding when I said I couldn\u2019t move them. Pain shimmers through my fingertips in odd, erratic pulses when he turns my hand to examine it. Then his fingers trace over the dark bruise forming on my cheekbone. That, too, feels swollen, damage out of proportion to the blow.</p><p>\u201cYou look breakable.\u201d His gaze lingers as if seeing me for the first time. \u201cAnd that scares the shit out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I murmur. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll figure it out. We always do.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t argue with me, but in his face I see pure, unadulterated fear. That\u2019s why March separated me from the others. He didn\u2019t want them to see it. Nobody else pays attention to me like he does, so the others probably won\u2019t notice that I\u2019m ill. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wouldn\u2019t you know it? I even go out different than the other jumpers. I\u2019ve spent my life courting death in various ways, living for the thrill, the rush, the risk. I jack in, knowing it might steal my mind away, knowing March may not be able to save me this time, and I keep doing it.</p><p>Grimspace beckons; I can\u2019t resist the call.</p><p>I don\u2019t even want to. I don\u2019t smoke, rarely drink, and I gave up chem years ago. This is my vice.</p><p>Even now, I\u2019m faintly irritated that I can\u2019t just jump, take us where I want to go. Fuck straight space travel. But it\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s an itch under my skin, and I can\u2019t scratch it, no matter what I do. The longing won\u2019t go away until the colors come roaring through me, and my mind blossoms to ten times its size. At this point, I must admit it might be killing me, albeit differently than most jumpers go out.</p> <p>Question is, what am I going to do about it?</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>Hell is two weeks on a ship with an infant.</p><p>If you don\u2019t believe me, try it. By the end of week one, I\u2019m ready to space both Koratati and her squalling bundle of pee. Dina says there\u2019s nothing wrong with the little rotter; that\u2019s just what babies do.</p><p>To make things easier for the new mother, we\u2019ve instigated a rotating care schedule. This wasn\u2019t my idea, by the way. I eventually caved to majority rule, but I did so with poor grace and a lot of mumbling.</p> <p>I manage to keep my sanity on this straight haul by hiding out. There are six crew rooms. March and I snag the largest one, probably intended for the captain. Surge and Kora share another, while Dina, Jael, and Vel each claim their own. The galley\u2019s on the other side of the ship. That leaves one room vacant, just before the maintenance closet with the hatch leading down to the holds.</p><p>I fill this space with spare chairs from storage and other odds and ends to make it more of a sitting room. The bunk can recess completely into the wall, making my job easier. Mostly I\u2019m waiting to hear from Doc, but the satellites are old and tetchy out here. I\u2019ll be lucky to get anything before we make Emry Station.</p><p>I tend to hunker down in there when the kid is crying because there\u2019s more metal between us. Sometimes it helps, but you\u2019d be surprised how that racket carries. When all the doors stand open, it\u2019s an acoustic nightmare.</p><p>Sometimes my esteemed crewmates join me, like I need company. I\u2019m quite occupied with feeling sorry for myself, thanks. I had a great-aunt whose main hobby included reading about strange diseases and then trying to match her symptoms to whatever exotic ailment took her fancy. Based on my depressive behavior this week, I suspect I may have more in common with my great-aunt Tallia than I would\u2019ve previously guessed.</p><p>Today Jael joins me. He\u2019s just come in and doesn\u2019t seem inclined to let me brood. With a faint sigh, I put 245 aside. People never understand why I talk to my PA, an ongoing experiment of sorts. Her AI chip seems incredibly sophisticated, and the more we interact, the more she learns, adapting her communication style to mirror my own. This fascinates me.</p><p>\u201cAre you busy?\u201d Without an audience, he sheds most of his bravado, and in an oddly tentative movement, he occupies a chair opposite where I sit.</p> <p>\u201cI guess not. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople always treat me different,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter they find out. You haven\u2019t. So I\u2019m wondering why.\u201d</p><p>I figure he\u2019s talking about his origins in the Ideal Genome Project. \u201cThis is pretty basic, but . . . it\u2019s because I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>The Corp implemented the program shortly before I was born. They offered designer babies for a premium price, and a few wealthy families took advantage of it. They used the profit margin to fund a side research project, seeking to perfect the human condition. Forget antiaging treatments; they wanted to develop bodies that don\u2019t age, don\u2019t suffer from illness, and require reduced amounts of rest.</p><p>Few of their Bred experiments survived to adulthood, and the Corp officially shut the program down after religious outcry that outweighed any theoretical value. Who can say what went on behind closed doors? Or what became of lab babies like the one sitting across from me? He\u2019s the first I\u2019ve ever met.</p><p>Jael looks puzzled. \u201cYou don\u2019t care as in . . . you\u2019re disinterested? Or you don\u2019t care as in . . . it doesn\u2019t matter to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth?\u201d Yeah, it\u2019s definitely both.</p><p>Why does that intrigue him? He sits forward in his chair, hands clasped across his knees. \u201cI don\u2019t get you.\u201d</p> <p>Great. He\u2019s interested because I\u2019m not? Men.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to get me. In fact I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t since you\u2019re disembarking next week, and I\u2019ll never see your face again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI already spoke to March, and he said I can stay. You don\u2019t have a gunner, and I know this ship\u2019s weapons better than anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Now why didn\u2019t March tell me that?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think will happen on Emry?\u201d I steer the conversation away from personal topics. At this point I\u2019m not interested in playing mother confessor, nor in soothing the scrapes on his soul. Plus I think it\u2019s possible we may need weapons to cow the fools playing at resistance out here.</p><p>As long as nobody questions it, they can call themselves autonomous. And the Conglomerate is notorious for taking forever to determine a course of action. I\u2019m amazed we got clearance to head for Ithiss-Tor so fast; we probably have Tarn to thank for that.</p><p>Jael gives the question due consideration. \u201cHard to say. Best to play it by ear once we get on station and see how they\u2019re running things. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve officially declared that they won\u2019t honor a ship\u2019s request for aid as yet. They\u2019re waiting to hear from the Conglomerate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll get messy,\u201d I predict. \u201cThe Conglomerate will say, \u2018Fine, if you\u2019re autonomous, you\u2019re also self-supporting, so you can pay for your own supplies, pay for station repairs on your own,\u2019 and so on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if they\u2019ve thought of that.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cProbably not. They\u2019re Corp wage slaves. This is the first burst of independent thought they\u2019ve enjoyed in a while. One can\u2019t blame them for being rusty. But if that threat doesn\u2019t work, then Tarn might send armed enforcers to clean the place out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Corp would\u2019ve just blown the place up and built a new one,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cLike they did DuPont Station?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard about that. They were looking for you, weren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Big scary terrorist, that\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>He snorts. \u201cYou don\u2019t look so tough.\u201d</p><p>Well, he\u2019s right. At the moment I feel like the baby could snap me like a twig. It\u2019s not a good idea to reveal your weaknesses, however.</p><p>\u201cAppearances can be deceiving.\u201d</p><p>The man flinches like I hit a raw nerve. \u201cI know that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, don\u2019t tell me people think you\u2019re pretty but dumb. That must really sting.\u201d This conversation is finally getting interesting. \u201cDo they suggest you should be in vids or wearing clothes professionally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d</p><p>Dina sweeps into the room in time to hear the invective. \u201cMaking new friends, are you, Jax?\u201d</p><p>I flash her a grin. \u201cYou know, with a winning personality like I\u2019ve got\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have ten different factions trying to kill us again within a week or two,\u201d she interjects.</p><p>\u201cTen? That seems a little on the high side, even for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figure we\u2019ve already got the Syndicate. The Ithtorians, who don\u2019t really want to receive us in the first place and so aren\u2019t going to be happy with this delay. The folks on Lachion are going to be wondering where we are, too . . . so that\u2019s three already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Keri would hunt me down? I thought she kinda liked me by the time we left last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she enjoyed beating the shit out of you.\u201d</p><p>Wearing an expression of tentative amusement, Jael listens to us banter. It seems like he wants to join in but isn\u2019t quite sure whether he\u2019s allowed. I don\u2019t tell him that picking on me is practically an official pastime around here.</p><p>But she\u2019s brought me a mug of hot choclaste. My brow arches even as I accept the offering. I can\u2019t help peering into the cup with suspicion.</p><p>\u201cDid you pee in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Dina waits until I\u2019ve taken a sip before adding, \u201cThe baby did.\u201d</p><p>I manage not to give her the satisfaction of spluttering. \u201cMmm. I thought it had a special something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nasty, you know that?\u201d She shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cDid March send you?\u201d The question comes out loaded.</p><p>When her gaze meets mine, I see that she\u2019s figured it out. I thought staying out of sight would be enough until I figured this thing out. Shit. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to handle it if Dina starts being nice to me. Treats me like an invalid.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I miss?\u201d Jael glances between us, sensing subtext. He really is smarter than he looks. That just might keep him alive with this crew.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I answer before Dina can. \u201cOkay, you did me a favor. Now what do you want in return?\u201d</p><p>She pins on a smile that troubles me. Mary curse it, she\u2019s worried about me. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn to watch the brat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it most certainly is not. I just\u2014\u201d I trail off because it\u2019s been days. I hoped if I stayed out of sight, people would forget.</p><p>This \u201cteam\u201d child-care thing sucks. I\u2019ve never been near an infant so young before. The kids I cared for on Gehenna were all toddling, at least, which gets you a whole different set of problems.</p><p>I down the choclaste in one gulp. \u201cFine. But any longer than two hours, and I\u2019m not responsible for what may happen. Wars have been started over less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s Jael\u2019s turn after yours. I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if I\u2019d let him,\u201d I mutter, heading for the door.</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>\u201cBernard\u2019s Luck to Emry Station. Requesting permission to dock.\u201d March has been sending that same message on a timed loop ever since our sensors first picked up the station.</p><p>So far no response\u2014and that worries me. Comm silence seldom results from a beneficial cause. Things may be worse than we\u2019ve been led to suppose. Emry Station never qualified as a hub of activity, and no telling what\u2019s going on there now. The last we heard, it was full of Farwan loyalists, but a lot can change in a few weeks.</p><p>The whole universe has changed, after all.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to stop, no matter what. We can\u2019t go on as we are.\u201d</p><p>I certainly agree with that. This crappy little cutter doesn\u2019t have the storage for long hauls. We need to fuel up, refill our water tanks, and get some more supplies on board: nutri-paste at the very least. Mary only knows who\u2019s going to pay for it. The one good thing about the Corp, I never had to worry about that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We\u2019ve already received two angry messages from Chancellor Tarn, wanting to know where the hell we are. I haven\u2019t decided what to tell him. I intend to blame nonreceipt of his messages on sunspots, rogue comets, and anything else I can think of along the way. Hopefully, he\u2019s a politician to the bone, and he\u2019ll make up a convincing story that doesn\u2019t leave the Ithtorians wanting to kill us on sight for insulting them.</p><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t just dump Surge, Kora, and\u2014what did they name the kid again? If it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know perfectly well they named her Sirina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d I don\u2019t remember registering that, actually.</p> <p>He nods, checking our distance from Emry. At our current cruising speed, we\u2019ll be there in under an hour. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of Sirantha and Dina . . . since you two helped Kora through her labor, Rodeisian tradition. Makes you like a . . . godmother or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does not.\u201d I can\u2019t hide how appalled I am. \u201cYou\u2019re making that up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t believe me?\u201d He grins. \u201cJust ask Kora.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat obligations does that involve? Am I supposed to remember her birthday? Send gifts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the oldest Terran sense you\u2019re responsible for her moral fiber. Set a good example, keep her on the straight and narrow, all that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow that you must be making up.\u201d</p><p>His grin delights me. \u201cIt\u2019s true. You can verify it with 245 if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re enjoying this far too much.\u201d I make a mental note to do just that, not that I don\u2019t trust him, but . . . well, you know.</p><p>\u201cFor Rodeisians, I suspect it involves something else entirely. You and Dina might be responsible for supervising Sirina\u2019s vision quest or something like that. Ask 245 about that as well.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, I try to imagine Dina and me coordinating anything as a team, let alone an outing that involves out-of-body experiences and mild hallucinogens. Thankfully that\u2019s years away yet. I sprawl back in the nav chair and turn my face upward, appealing to a grungy gunmetal ceiling. \u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you fight so hard against attachments?\u201d Though delivered casually, I register the intent quality of the question.</p> <p>I force myself to answer lightly. \u201cYeah, that must be it. What\u2019s the plan?\u201d</p><p>March raises a brow. \u201cWhen do we ever have a plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe always have a plan. We just don\u2019t stick to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the point of making it? Why not just wing it?\u201d</p><p>I glare. \u201cAre you in the mood to argue with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually I\u2019m in the mood to fuck, but our timing\u2019s off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it always? Dance lessons might help.\u201d</p><p>The smile kindles in his dark eyes before it reaches his mouth. With a wonder that actually steals my breath, I watch its genesis like a mini-sunrise lighting his whole face. I don\u2019t know how I got by without him, or why I fought so hard against this. The first impression scares the shit out of me, but it\u2019s breathtaking, too, like when you push off a cliff and feel the wind against your face. At that point, you\u2019re not thinking of anything but free fall.</p> <p>Landing comes later. That\u2019s what hurts. Then again, what doesn\u2019t?</p><p>I can close my eyes and construct this man\u2019s face, feature by feature. Could I ever do that with Kai? I can\u2019t remember anymore. I know he had blond hair and green eyes, but he\u2019s faded, like someone I knew a long time ago. And I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s okay, or if it just makes me fickle.</p><p>He answers my thought without looking at me. \u201cIt makes you human.\u201d</p><p>That sounds like an equivocation to me, but then, I know he doesn\u2019t like finding me thinking about the love I lost. That\u2019s tough shit, I\u2019m afraid. I can\u2019t forget about Kai. I never will. He was different than March in every conceivable way, so it puzzles me how I could love two such dissimilar men.</p><p>I have this dream sometimes where I\u2019m in a white room, no furniture, but there are two exits. Kai stands before one door and March stands before the other. I\u2019m caught in the middle, and I have to choose. I know this is a bullshit crazy-ass thing because I\u2019ll never have to pick.</p><p>Kai is gone. I\u2019ll never see him or touch him again. I\u2019m happy with March. I love him, I do. But the dream still wakes me up in a cold sweat.</p><p>How do you measure love? Quantify it? It\u2019s not something you can put on a scale or pour into a beaker to examine its volume and viscosity.</p><p>Crazy Jax, worried about choosing between the living and the dead. Some days, though, I feel like I\u2019m closer to the latter than the former, and it\u2019s not improving. If anything, I\u2019m getting worse. The bruise Kora inflicted on me two weeks ago should be healed. Instead it\u2019s just starting to turn blue-green.</p><p>My hair should be growing back. I should have a short, nappy crop of curls on my head by now, but it still looks much as it did after we shaved it. When I look in the mirror, it\u2019s like I can see ghosts swimming in the glass. They can\u2019t touch me yet, but my head echoes with their whispers.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t think that way.\u201d March finally cuts me a look, away from the instrument panels and readings he doesn\u2019t need to monitor.</p><p>I remember that from the old days, before I knew how he felt about me. He used the controls as a way to distance himself from me. And the fact that he\u2019s doing it now tells me he thinks we do, indeed, have something to fear.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever heard of a jumper wasting away like this?\u201d There, I finally said it out loud. Now it\u2019s no longer the pink orangutan that everyone pretends not to see.</p><p>\u201cNo, but that doesn\u2019t matter. After we wrap things up here on Emry, we\u2019re heading straight for Lachion, so Doc can take a look at you. Don\u2019t worry, Jax. We\u2019ll fix it.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t argue with him, but I have a feeling it won\u2019t be that simple. At this point we don\u2019t even know what \u201cit\u201d is. There are any number of medical facilities we could jump to from here, no need to target Lachion, except I trust Doc, and I won\u2019t have somebody I don\u2019t know poking around in my head. Or my intestines for that matter. Those days are done.</p><p>Further complicating matters, we really shouldn\u2019t jump to Ithiss-Tor until we\u2019re certain I\u2019m not infectious. Most likely any illness I\u2019ve contracted wouldn\u2019t translate to their systems, but I prefer to be sure. I\u2019m not killing off a whole race as an unwitting plague carrier.</p><p>Unless that\u2019s what someone intends. What if I\u2019ve been infected on purpose? What if\u2014</p><p>\u201cJax.\u201d With a word, he reins in my paranoia.</p><p>One thing\u2019s certain, though. I\u2019ll choose a trip to a Psych and a Eutha-booth over some long, lingering illness that has no cure. Either March is distracted, or he prefers to ignore that. Just as well, I don\u2019t want to fight. Too tired.</p><p>Still no answer from Emry. We\u2019ve reached real visual range now, no more distant images picked up by the sensors. I lean in, studying the energy readings, though I don\u2019t know enough about it to draw conclusions.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike something\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong like they all caught some exotic disease and died, and the station is now infected with deadly parasites that kill you with bloody hemorrhaging out the eyeballs? Or wrong like they don\u2019t want to encourage visitors?\u201d</p><p>March regards me for a moment and then shakes his head. \u201cEver an optimist, aren\u2019t you? Your imagination scares me sometimes, Jax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, the Psychs always said that about me, too.\u201d</p><p>Truthfully, I\u2019m getting a bad vibe from Emry Station. Not like what waited for us on DuPont, nothing as harmless as Hon and his raiders. It\u2019s too quiet here, too still.</p><p>Something\u2019s down there. And it\u2019s not in the mood to talk.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>Whatever has gone wrong inside, the automated system still works.</p><p>As we glide toward the bay doors, the sensors detect us, and Emry opens up. I try to squelch the mental image of the docking mechanism as a gigantic maw waiting to devour us. Comm silence has become eerie.</p><p>By now someone should have come on, asking about the nature of our emergency. Instead the station AI coordinates our arrival in mechanized silence. Through the view screen, I watch as the inner doors seal. They won\u2019t reopen until the outer doors close, and this area regains sufficient pressure and oxygen levels to support human life. Typically that takes about two minutes.</p><p>Emry is an ugly station, designed with function in mind: two circular decks that rotate slowly in counterpoint to create artificial gravity. I wait until the docking procedure completes and then swing out of the nav chair. March follows me down through the hub, all the way to the hatch.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKora and Dina need to stay with the ship,\u201d he says at once.</p><p>That must be because he wants one of our people making sure Surge and Jael don\u2019t fuel up and repo this thing, leaving us stranded. March grins and offers an infinitesimal nod. I guess he doesn\u2019t trust Vel completely yet, for all the guy saved my ass a few weeks ago. I can\u2019t blame March; he takes a while to warm up to people.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d Vel says quietly.</p><p>I\u2019m not entirely sure that\u2019s a good idea. We might need him on the ship to help Dina, if our passengers get any bold ideas. That is, until Jael adds, \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>I relax a little. Dina can handle herself against Surge. Kora should be too busy looking after Sirina to start anything. Plus if Dina is really her baby\u2019s godmother, there should be some Rodeisian rule against attacking her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s gear up then.\u201d</p><p>What gear? I\u2019ve been a galactic vagabond since the Sargasso , owning little more than a change of clothes. I\u2019m not sure what he means, unless the Luck has a hidden cache. Over the last two weeks I\u2019ve been over this junk-bucket starboard to stern and didn\u2019t find anything. Then again, maybe I just didn\u2019t know where to look.</p><p>March heads for the maintenance closet. I watch as he keys open a smuggler\u2019s cupboard, where they\u2019ve hidden a supply of shocksticks and a disruptor. He takes the latter and shoves it through his belt. With a shudder I remember how the thing mangled his arm, how I used it on other human beings. I\u2019ll never be able to use one again: Sometimes in my sleep I still hear their screams. Before DuPont Station, I\u2019d never killed anyone.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how much use I\u2019ll be in a fight, but I take a baton nonetheless. Jael follows suit, but Vel just shakes his head and turns toward the exit.</p><p>Since I\u2019ve seen him fight bare-handed, I know he doesn\u2019t need a weapon. He\u2019ll have to slip his human skin, though. Jael will probably piss himself if that happens.</p><p>\u201cLeave the light on for us,\u201d I call to Dina.</p><p>She grins. \u201cTry not to get yourself killed, dumb-ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tough job, but someone\u2019s got to do it.\u201d</p><p>March pauses and then says to Surge, \u201cSee if you can get the fueling system to engage, but do not leave the docking bay.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if the guy\u2019s dumb enough to venture out alone. I tend to say no\u2014he was smart enough to get off planet when he didn\u2019t have enough creds to provision his ship. I think they\u2019ll be okay. Plus he\u2019s got a wife and kid to think about, so Surge won\u2019t do anything stupid. He\u2019s not the one we need to worry about cowboying all over the place. I glance at Jael and sigh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>March is the first one out. He skins down the ladder with a grace I can\u2019t help but admire. Or maybe it\u2019s his ass. Anyway, I go next, hitting the ground with an extra bounce that tells me we\u2019re in light G. The station\u2019s crew probably take supplements to prevent suffering long-term physiological damage.</p><p>Vel lands lightly beside me, and Jael doesn\u2019t bother with the ladder, just leaps. Despite my best intentions, his recklessness appeals to me on a visceral level. In another time, before the Sargasso, I suspect I would\u2019ve found him irresistible.</p><p>March cuts me a look, but thankfully he doesn\u2019t say anything, at least not about that. I\u2019m glad he has some common sense. From the look of the docking bay, we might be the last humans left in this sector. Sputtering lights hint at some unknown electrical problem, and my sense of foreboding doubles.</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s safe to go on?\u201d I hesitate, looking at the far doors, which lead into the station proper.</p> <p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d March flashes me a smile. \u201cYou still in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d It goes unspoken that I was ready to die at his side weeks ago. That hasn\u2019t changed.</p><p>\u201cWe work in pairs then. Vel, you\u2019re with Jax. Jael, you come with me.\u201d</p><p>Falling in with Vel, I can\u2019t help but raise my brows. I didn\u2019t expect we\u2019d split up. \u201cYou sure this is a good idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re sticking together, Jax. I\u2019m not stupid. But you never know what might happen inside, so it\u2019s best if you have someone designated to watch your back.\u201d</p> <p>That makes sense. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m guarding Vel.\u201d</p><p>More like the other way around, but the bounty hunter is kind enough not to say it aloud. The automated system has opened the doors into the station for us, but I can\u2019t see beyond a turn in the dark corridor. A wisp of something brushes my face, like a spiderweb, but when I turn I can\u2019t see anything. Maybe it\u2019s nerves.</p><p>Nobody speaks as we push onward. All my aches and pains fade to a low hum. The instincts that have kept me alive for thirty-three years kick to the fore, leaving me clearheaded and alert. I feel Vel at my back, like he\u2019s my mantid guardian. Shit, he might be for all I know.</p><p>In my right hand, I feel sweat forming around the shockstick. The air doesn\u2019t smell right as we move deeper, following the external corridors toward the inner reaches of the station. The security doors are all stuck wide open.</p><p>Yeah, something\u2019s definitely wrong.</p><p>As we come into the commissary, I see the place has been ransacked. Crates and barrels torn open, but the supplies have been left behind. What the hell were they looking for? Chem? Contraband? Anyone with half a brain knows you aren\u2019t going to find that on an emergency station. Smugglers avoid these places like the plague.</p> <p>Here, you can fuel up and buy paste, maybe some organic for the kitchen-mate if they\u2019ve stocked up recently. You can also find basic medical assistance. And that\u2019s all a station like this offers.</p><p>Sweet. Something smells sweet and raw. Almost like a butcher shop gone bad.</p><p>Overhead, the lights flicker and go out.</p><p>Wordlessly, Vel produces a torch-tube from his pack. Ever prepared, he is. When he bends it, the chemicals mix and emit an eerie yellow-green glow. The silence is starting to get to me. I can hear the hum of distant machinery, but no human movements, no voices echoing.</p><p>Just silence. Darkness.</p><p>Vel raises his light just as I step into a puddle of something dark and sticky. Blood. Oh Mary, it\u2019s like being trapped on the Sargasso, but without the overlying stench of burnt meat.</p><p>I feel March curl his hand around my shoulder, reassuring me. \u201cDid anyone else bring light?\u201d</p><p>Like a stupid newb, I have to shake my head. Apart from the shockstick I didn\u2019t bring a damn thing. Sweat rolls down my spine, pools in the small of my back. My jumpsuit sticks to me, and I\u2019m sure I stink of fear.</p> <p>You\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019m not going to let anything happen to you. His presence fills my head, pushes back the panic. Maybe they\u2019re empty promises, but March has never let me down.</p><p>Jael has been oddly silent, so he startles me when he finally speaks. \u201cI\u2019ve been through something like this before,\u201d he says, as if he doesn\u2019t want his voice to carry.</p><p>I still don\u2019t hear anything. It\u2019s as if we\u2019re being hunted, unseen predators creeping closer while we wheel blindly in the dark. At this moment I\u2019d sell my soul for a pair of night-vision goggles.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d March asks. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>The guy just shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to upset anyone.\u201d I glare, not that he can see me. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out he means me. Before I can tell him off, he continues, \u201cIf I\u2019m wrong, then there\u2019s no need for me to talk about it.\u201d His voice grows taut. \u201cAnd if I\u2019m right, then Mary help us all.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>From behind, l hear the sound of the inner docking doors clanging closed. Now we\u2019re effectively separated from the others until we find a way to get them opened. Divide and conquer. It\u2019s the oldest trick in the book, but we couldn\u2019t have taken a new mother and her child with us to explore the station.</p><p>Our fate hangs on Dina\u2019s preventing Surge and Kora from stranding us here. I have a lot of faith in our mechanic, but we may have stuck her with an impossible task. They have a pilot and a jumper on board, but I hope they won\u2019t want to risk scrambling their daughter\u2019s brains.</p><p>Transport companies won\u2019t have an infant on board on interstellar voyages\u2014too much liability involved. As far as I know, they deny children under the age of two, and even transporting children older than that requires a special ship outfitted with miniature jump gear.</p><p>With a sigh, I glance around the commissary, seeking anything we can use. I spot a box of uncracked torch-tubes. Though decidedly unglamorous, I\u2019m glad I\u2019m wearing this baggy jumpsuit because it has six pockets. I stuff them full, a total of ten.</p><p>Vel\u2019s stick won\u2019t last forever. When the chemicals burn out, we\u2019ll be left flailing in the dark. So here\u2019s a little insurance against that eventuality. We can ration them. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do when the lights go out.</p><p>Can\u2019t think about that.</p><p>A little more rummaging unearths eight packets of paste. I hope we won\u2019t be here long enough to need them, but I snag the food nonetheless. Nothing else catches my eye as immediately useful. There are spare parts and fuel cells for weapons we don\u2019t possess. They wouldn\u2019t carry charge packs for the disruptor March carries, given that it counts as contraband.</p><p>Going forward seems like our only option, even if it\u2019s into the trackless dark. I shudder a little. It was dark when the Sargasso went down, and I spent twelve hours pinned. My scars flare with phantom pain.</p><p>Wish I\u2019d stayed on the ship, even if it meant changing Sirina.</p><p>\u201cIt seems obvious that something happened to the original station crew,\u201d March says. \u201cWe have to figure out what, or it might take us, too.\u201d</p><p>I feel Vel at my shoulder, oddly reassuring. \u201cIf we can get to a terminal, I can patch into their security cams and see what went on before our arrival. Knowing our enemy will help us formulate the best course of action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d March leads the way.</p><p>Shadows play hell with my peripheral vision as we move out of the commissary. We\u2019ll worry about supplies once we have a way to get them off station. I try to focus on that\u2014we will get out of this.</p><p>\u201cWatch for webs.\u201d Jael sounds cold and collected, not the pretty, useless ornament I initially took him for. I suspect he\u2019s seen something, noticed something, that slipped right past me.</p><p>Webs. As I process that, Vel adds, \u201cAnd cocoons.\u201d</p><p>Does everyone know what\u2019s on this station except me? In the distance, I register a skittering sound, oddly familiar. Where have I heard that before?</p><p>I\u2019ve almost got it when Vel tackles me, and we hit the floor hard. I lose my grip on the shockstick, not that I\u2019m in any shape to fight. It clatters along the floor, throwing tiny sparks of light. Ahead, March and Jael scatter to opposite sides of the hallway. A sweet stench hits me on a breeze that shouldn\u2019t be, which means\u2014</p><p>Movement.</p><p>Something white and filmy rebounds down the hall, passing between the four of us. A trap? It looks like a web, just as Jael said.</p><p>\u201cThey may have set venom mines as well,\u201d Vel murmurs near my ear. \u201cIf it spatters on your skin, the rest of you will be immobilized.\u201d</p><p>Not him, though. His physiology renders him poisonous to them. Now I know what we\u2019re facing\u2014the Morgut. That\u2019s human slang, because they\u2019re more gut than anything else. The last time I saw some of these fuckers, they tried to eat me.</p><p>Then again, I was asking for it.</p><p>I start to suggest turning back and then I remember they\u2019ve sealed us in with them. Nothing like playing with your food a bit before you eat it.</p><p>\u201cNoted,\u201d March says from a few feet up. \u201cYou mentioned you\u2019ve been through something like this before,\u201d he adds to Jael. \u201cSo tell us what you know.\u201d</p><p>Call it paranoia, a quality I possess in spades, but I don\u2019t think we should stand here talking. Maybe stumbling blindly ahead isn\u2019t the best idea either, but they may be monitoring these hallways. Homing in on their prey. Us. So the longer we hang around, the easier they catch us.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been hunted before, and I don\u2019t much care for the sensation.</p><p>Surprisingly, Vel echoes my thoughts. \u201cNot here. It is vital we get to a terminal. I need to know what happened here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you,\u201d Jael says, as we round a corner with maximumcaution. \u201cWe interrupted their dinner, and now they plan on having us for dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell us while we move then.\u201d March doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s in the mood to negotiate on this point.</p><p>Jael seems to recognize this, but his voice holds a raw, unwilling note. \u201cI signed on with Surge, maybe four years back. You\u2019d already quit the game,\u201d he says to March. \u201cThe rest of us were still willing to bleed for Nicuan. They had the money, and they never tire of the fight. Nobody wins, everybody dies.\u201d</p><p>We creep along by millimeters, staying in the shallow circle of light. Maybe we\u2019d be better off to douse it, but I can\u2019t face the dark. I\u2019ll lose my mind. The ventilation system kicks in, sending a hiss of air past our faces. I\u2019m already on the floor, jumpy as a chem-head after two days without a fix.</p><p>Jael gives me a hand up, tugs me to my feet with a Bred strength belied by his slender build. He continues tonelessly. \u201cSomeday, after we\u2019re all gone, archaeologists will find cities of bone on that world. Our commanders were useless, soft, pampered imperial types, who came up with strategies from the comfort of their manor houses. Body count didn\u2019t matter to them. They offered hazard pay and death benefits to the soldiers\u2019 families.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Despite our situation, I almost succeed in forgetting about the living night all around us, haunted by mechanical noises and suspicious thumps in the ducts overhead. Almost.</p><p>\u201cMy CO sent us off world to investigate trouble at a satellite weapons factory, built outside of terrestrial tariffs. They kept a skeleton crew on-site to monitor the automated production system, make necessary repairs. And then one day, the place went quiet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLike Emry,\u201d Vel observes.</p><p>\u201cJust so. This is how the Morgut prefer to operate. Pick a small, unimportant outpost and devour everything inside. If they\u2019re left undisturbed, they\u2019ll sometimes nest. Breed, before moving on to their next hunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you got away from them.\u201d I cling to that as a beacon of hope while the dark swims around us, eddies and ebbs in fluid waves that keep me jerking in all directions. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ve ever been this scared.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jael says. \u201cAnd lightning doesn\u2019t strike twice in the same place.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s a regular bundle of cheer. I didn\u2019t need to be reminded that I\u2019ve stretched my luck until it\u2019s transparent.</p><p>Stay cool, Jax. This is no worse than a bad jump.</p><p>The hell it isn\u2019t. At least grimspace can only steal my mind, not suck all the juices out of me, devour my flesh, and pick its fangs with my bones. My fingers tighten on the shockstick, not that I think it\u2019ll do me any good.</p><p>From what I remember they\u2019re insanely fast. On the Silverfish , after Vel captured me, I tried to feed myself to them instead of going back to the Corp. Yeah, I was desperate. A monstrous marriage of arachnid and humanoid, the Morgut have fanged mouths, jointed limbs, and hairy bodies that bulge in obscene, unnatural ways.</p><p>I try not to think about that as I stay close on Vel\u2019s heels. I\u2019m guarding our rear flank, and I can\u2019t help but remember the scary vids where the person in back gets yanked away to some hideous fate, and nobody notices for like ten minutes.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll always come for you, Jax.\u201d Distracted by the need to watch our every movement, March answers me aloud.</p><p>The other two don\u2019t seem to wonder what that\u2019s about, though. Vel shines his light before we move a single meter while March pans with his disruptor. Anything that moves in the dark is going to get its innards rearranged. I\u2019m not sure what to make of Jael. He\u2019s too calm and unshaken.</p><p>We\u2019re coming up on a two-way split in the corridor. Without a layout or a peek at station plans, we have no way of knowing which way we should turn. Down one of those halls might lie a nest or something worse.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Jael points without elaborating as to why we should go that way.</p><p>After Vel shines the light both ways, I don\u2019t have an opinion, but I do know my skin is crawling all to hell. It feels like I\u2019m passing through wisps of webs, not enough to entrap me, but they do stick to my face. I refuse to let myself start slapping at my skin, a complete breakdown of impulse versus intellect. I won\u2019t be the one to go nuts and flee, shrieking in the dark.</p><p>The hum of machinery grows louder as we make the turn Jael suggested. Maybe we can find a terminal here, so Vel can patch in and see how many we\u2019re looking at. I\u2019d rather know the odds, straight out. I saw the bounty hunter handle a full clutch of Morgut on board the Silverfish, so maybe our chances are good. Maybe.</p> <p>I continue the silent pep talk as we continue, step by step. The coppery stink increases, the closer we come. By the time we hit maintenance, I have to cover my nose and mouth with my shirt.</p><p>Mary, no.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to look, but it\u2019s a compulsion as Vel lifts his light. I register impressions as flashes that burn themselves into my retinas. I\u2019ll see this room again, frame by frame, in my nightmares, as if rendered on some old-fashioned film.</p><p>They\u2019ve been here. Chunks of flesh litter the floor. I imagine the hunger, the frenzy that drove them to this. I imagine the spilled blood as an intoxicant, reacting on their alien body chemistry.</p><p>To them, we are, quite simply, delicious.</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>The blood has dried, leaving dark, tacky patches on the metal floor.</p><p>If left untended, it will rust. Don\u2019t ask me why I\u2019ve focused on that, but I want to scrub all this away, as if that would mean it didn\u2019t happen. Lives weren\u2019t lost here.</p> <p>I should know better than anyone how impossible that is. Cleaning up a mess doesn\u2019t negate it. And some things can\u2019t be swept under the proverbial rug.</p><p>The Conglomerate will have no choice but to deal with the Morgut now. In its day, the Corp dealt with them in terms of property damage. They didn\u2019t care about loss of life, only the bottom line. But these monsters are growing bolder now. They\u2019ve acquired a taste for human flesh, and they don\u2019t believe the human authorities have the power to stop them.</p><p>And maybe they\u2019re right.</p><p>Vel sweeps his light in a slow circle. This room holds half-repaired bots and cleaning droids, spare parts, and bins full of wires. Against the far wall, there\u2019s a terminal meant for diagnostics, but maybe it connects to the rest of the station.</p><p>We can hope. By the low hiss of the unit, we still have power, even if the lights aren\u2019t working. Vel sets up at the terminal while March and Jael take up guard positions in front of the door. Since we\u2019re doing two things at once now, not moving as a unit, another light might come in handy. Plus I want them to be able to see anything that tries to get at us.</p><p>I hand a tube to March, who snaps it immediately. Now we have two anemic pools of yellow-green light. Because Vel is supposed to be watching my back\u2014and vice versa\u2014 I head over to his side. He keys with unbelievable speed, but before I can try to assimilate what he\u2019s doing, he\u2019s inside their system.</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen anyone crack code like he does. Most hackers rely on gadgets, portable AIs that run all the possible combinations. With Vel, it almost seems intuitive, like he can hear machines on a level that we can\u2019t.</p><p>Another few clicks, and a grainy image comes up on the screen. Routine bot surveillance, these units perform basic cleaning, maintenance, and repairs as well. We see what the little machine sees, a corridor that could be anywhere on the station.</p><p>\u201cAnything yet?\u201d March asks without glancing our way.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re watching a bot\u2014\u201d I break off because even the low-quality images can\u2019t conceal what\u2019s sliding past.</p><p>I recognize the jerky, multijointed movements. Here\u2019s visual confirmation, and a chill rolls over me. When this recording ends in static, Vel switches to another. And another, until we\u2019ve seen every last droid destroyed.</p><p>There\u2019s no record of the people who died here, screaming unheard. No bloody images the talking heads can use on the vids to rouse people to a vocal outcry. And the truth is, nobody dirtside gives a shit what happens to the folks up here. Maybe they even privately think we deserve such things for taking the risk.</p><p>We may find their names later on the outpost manifest or on duty rosters. If we survive. And it will be up to us to remember.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a full clutch,\u201d he says at last. \u201cAt least ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere may be more if they\u2019ve had time to nest,\u201d Jael adds. \u201cThey breed fast. And they\u2019ll be utterly savage if they\u2019re protecting young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are always savage.\u201d After checking to be sure he can\u2019t get primary systems online from here, Vel powers down the terminal. \u201cBut I concur, that would make it worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould they lay eggs on a station without a renewable food source?\u201d That\u2019s such a disgusting question.</p><p>March shrugs. \u201cWe\u2019re here, aren\u2019t we? Maybe they counted on a ship arriving now and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPointless speculation,\u201d Vel says.</p><p>Jael adds, \u201cWe need to find and exterminate them. The time for talking is over.\u201d</p><p>I actually agree with Jael. Now that we have a rough idea how many we\u2019re facing, the hunted need to become the hunters. Vel had an advantage against them on the Silverfish ; they couldn\u2019t lair up there, or spin webs and traps. In close quarters, he has the edge since they use their fangs on prey\u2014and if they bite him, they\u2019ll die.</p><p>But here on Emry, they\u2019ve had time to get comfortable. They have the upper hand. We\u2019ll need to be tough, smart, and careful to make it out alive.</p><p>The instant I conceive that thought, the door slams shut. March and Jael spin as one, weapons drawn and ready. But there\u2019s nothing to fight. How do you combat what you can\u2019t see?</p><p>A hiss from the ventilation system gives the first warning.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to gas us,\u201d Jael says grimly. \u201cFragging cowards.\u201d</p><p>Vel lifts his face, breathes in. \u201cIt\u2019s nontoxic, designed to make you dizzy and noncombative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not bothering you,\u201d Jael says, his words already slurred.</p><p>He\u2019s finally figuring out that Vel isn\u2019t as average as he looks. What I wouldn\u2019t give for a rebreather. My stomach lurches, and my head starts to spin. The room seems smoky, and I can\u2019t make my eyes focus.</p><p>I see two Vels standing before me, and his voice seems to come from very far away. \u201cDon\u2019t go to sleep, Sirantha. Do you understand me? Stay awake.\u201d</p><p>But I\u2019m so tired. If I could just lie down for a minute, I could figure everything out. I\u2019m positive of it. I\u2019ve lost track of March and Jael.</p><p>My knees feel like they\u2019re melting. Vel jerks me upright and gives me a shake that rattles my teeth in my head. When that doesn\u2019t help a whole lot, he slaps me full across the face. That stings enough that I try to fight back.</p><p>And that\u2019s when the things drop down from the ceiling.</p><p>My head spins too much to count them. When Vel knocks me flat, I have the sense to stay down, though the blow feels like it may have cracked a few ribs. Ironically, the pain clears my head to some degree.</p><p>I try to breathe through my shirt, and that helps a little, too. On my belly, I crawl along the floor, taking refuge behind a crate of machine parts. The fighting seems blurred and distant, too far away for where I\u2019m hiding.</p><p>My vision can\u2019t be relied upon. I hear March swearing steadily as he fires. He\u2019s taken cover somewhere nearby. I hear the wet, splattering sound of the disruptor rearranging meat. The Morgut don\u2019t scream when they die; they keen.</p><p>Jael screams. My whole body tenses in response to the anguish of the sound. Backlit by a fallen torch-tube, I see the Morgut hold his body aloft, skewered on one of the creature\u2019s forelegs.</p><p>Vel almost seems to fly as he crosses the room, severing the limb with a sonicblade I didn\u2019t even know he had. But he\u2019s got a pack of them following hard on his heels, so he can\u2019t do more for Jael, who hits the ground in an agonizing arc. The wounded thing shudders; blood spatters, hot drops raining down on my face.</p><p>The bounty hunter wheels on the ones sinking their teeth into him from behind. His weapon hums as he carves a gory map into their flesh. And the one that\u2019s missing a leg turns on March, who\u2019s waiting for the disruptor to power up again. The weapon cycles up, the lights on its grip indicating when it will be ready.</p><p>I give myself another good slap, fighting the effects of the gas. I can\u2019t say whether it\u2019s will or something else, but I manage to clear my head a little more. My own cry strangles in my throat. I taste the copper of Jael\u2019s blood, the flavor of terror and despair. Vel goes down beneath a wave of them. They\u2019ll die in agony, but if they hurt him bad enough, he\u2019ll perish, too. Grim comfort.</p><p>The disruptor won\u2019t do March any good this time; he\u2019s used it too much, and it\u2019s taking forever to charge. The Morgut advances, trembling with lust. Its fangs drip with the salivary fluid that paralyzes us. One scrape, and he will be done. The Morgut hesitates, and then, with a careless swipe, it knocks the useless weapon from March\u2019s hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It clatters to the floor a few meters from me, skidding into Vel\u2019s sonicblade. I can\u2019t cower here. I have to do something. I\u2019m not the only jumper for once, so my life isn\u2019t more valuable than anyone else\u2019s.</p><p>Knowing any movement could draw their lethal hunger, knowing I might feel a spear through my intestines at any second, I crawl along the floor toward the sonicblade. I could die.</p><p>Well, I\u2019m willing.</p><p>I pinch the soft skin of my inner wrist. I need pain, need it to focus and stay in the here and now. I can\u2019t give in to the fuzziness building inside my head.</p> <p>The swarm atop Velith finally processes that they aren\u2019t sucking down sweet, delicious blood. Some fall into convulsions, a putrid froth boiling from their fanged maws. Some stagger away, weak and dying. Only two look as though they could fight. That\u2019s three too many, and they\u2019re all stalking March.</p><p>At this point, they don\u2019t register anyone else as a threat. We\u2019re beaten. Food.</p><p>He backs toward the terminal, trying to lead them away from me.</p><p>Oh, no you don\u2019t. We have too much to do yet. You\u2019re not dying for me.</p><p>\u201cWho better?\u201d he says aloud.</p> <p>No.</p><p>As it lunges to dismember him, I hurl the knife.</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>The blade whistles as it spins end over end and buries itself in the Morgut\u2019s faceted eye. Lucky shot. Though its brain has shut down, it will take a while for the body to figure that out. Its high-pitched death shriek distracts the other two long enough for March to dive toward Vel\u2019s body. At first I think he\u2019s lost his mind because he rolls across him, smearing himself with the bounty hunter\u2019s blood.</p><p>He muffles a pained sound. I imagine it stings like hell, but now I get it. Suddenly, he\u2019s tainted meat. They can\u2019t just sink their teeth in and feast. He\u2019ll need to be hosed off first.</p><p>Damned inconvenient, isn\u2019t it, you greedy bastards?</p> <p>The other two chitter and clack, clawed forelegs waving with genuine menace. Maybe they\u2019re discussing the best course of action or marveling at the ingenuity of their prey. Maybe they\u2019re considering unconditional surrender because we might all be Ithtorians beneath the skin.</p><p>Hey, I can dream.</p><p>But even if they want to parlay, we have no way to talk to them, and I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t speak universal. Why would they bother? Humans certainly never troubled to learn bovine back when we were still eating cows.</p><p>Vel might have translated\u2014but he\u2019s out. He needs medical attention, and Jael must be dead. I can help best by keeping out of trouble. They might have qualms about going after March with their fangs, but I have no such protection.</p><p>So I stay low and scuttle along the floor, slippery with blood, bowels, and insect innards for which I have no name. The smell nearly compels me to add my dinner to the mess as I try to make my way toward the fallen Morgut with the knife in his head. If I can get that to March without being seen, he may have a chance. He stands in a battle-ready crouch, waiting for their strike, most likely in unison. They\u2019ll use their claws, not fangs, but if they coordinate it well, he\u2019s doomed.</p><p>The room is queerly lit by fallen torch-tubes, a flickering yellow-green glow that gives the maintenance shop a surreal, hellish air. Smoky gas lingers, ebbs, and eddies, adding to the infernal atmosphere. I pass into pockets that make me light-headed. I\u2019m tempted to rest my eyes until it passes. Sleep will make it better\u2014</p><p>Can\u2019t. Vel told me to stay awake.</p><p>I shake off the confusion with sheer will. Please don\u2019t let them notice me. My own movements look oddly staccato as I slide behind boxes and barrels, and then crawl on my belly through the muck toward the twitching monster. The blade makes a sucking motion as I yank it out, and then the faint hum kicks in. Good, still functional.</p> <p>I slap it across the floor so it bounces against his boot. Low G gives it extra lift when he kicks it upward and catches it by the handle as if we\u2019ve orchestrated the maneuver hundreds of times before. The Morgut lunge for him as one, but he\u2019s got a shot now.</p><p>\u201cFuck it,\u201d March says, as he wheels into the fight. \u201cI\u2019ll play the doomed hero another day. Don\u2019t worry, Jax.\u201d</p><p>My chest feels tight. Even now, he reassures me.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019ve given him the edge he needs, but I can\u2019t watch. I need to stay away from the action, or I may offer these monsters a hostage. Worse, they might stab me through the throat on the backswing.</p><p>I take refuge behind a crate of machine parts, come around the other side, and find Jael\u2019s body. Blood still bubbles sluggishly out of his gut wound around the limb that skewered him. His face looks impossibly young, pure and clean, despite the filth that surrounds us.</p><p>When his eyes snap open, I recoil. In the distance I hear March swearing steadily. That\u2019s good, means he\u2019s still alive, for now. Holding his own.</p><p>Before Jael speaks, I\u2019m sure I know what he\u2019s going to ask of me\u2014a mercy killing. End his pain. But I don\u2019t have a weapon. Lost my shockstick, the disruptor won\u2019t charge, and March has the blade. How can I let this poor bastard suffer?</p><p>\u201cPull it out.\u201d His voice comes out thick and wet. I can hear fluid in his throat, probably from his internal injuries. \u201cDo it fast, damn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll bleed to death.\u201d Stupid to protest, he\u2019s dying anyway.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me hurt you.\u201d</p><p>I choke out a laugh at that. He can\u2019t even lift his head, and he\u2019s threatening me? Trembling from head to toe, I do as he asks. Wrap my hands around the severed leg and tug hard. With some part of my mind, I register that it sounds a lot like the knife coming out of the Morgut\u2019s skull. It takes all my willpower not to hurl.</p><p>\u201cSeal the wound with your palm.\u201d Even as he barks the order, Jael lifts weak hands, trying to do it himself.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how the hell he thinks this will help, but I can\u2019t refuse a dying man his last request. Even if it means feeling his guts beneath my hand\u2014</p><p>Except the wound isn\u2019t as wide as it ought to be, and unless the gas has completely fried my brain, it\u2019s getting smaller. I touch him gingerly, exploring his lower abdomen, and I find only wet skin. Bloody, but whole.</p><p>\u201cOkay, what the hell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now,\u201d he says, lurching to his feet. \u201cYour boy needs help over there.\u201d</p><p>With that, he dives into the fray, armed with the foreleg the Morgut stabbed him with. The fury from remembered agony must lend him strength because Jael shoves it straight through the creature\u2019s neck. My first shocked thought\u2014He wasn\u2019t kidding on the ship when he said he\u2019d kill us all.</p><p>I have to see, have to know. So I scramble to my feet and slip-slide over to March, who\u2019s on his knees, sonicblade still in hand. Entrails spill along the floor, twisting bits of flesh that seem so inexpressibly alien that I shudder just looking at them. He\u2019s bleeding from about a hundred cuts, but he seems to be in one piece.</p><p>A sob escapes me. I touch him briefly on the shoulder, a gesture that says everything as I pass by.</p><p>Vel played bait for the rest of us, and I already owe him so much. I want to know him better, perhaps more than he\u2019ll ever allow. And it might be too late.</p><p>I kneel in his blood, feeling it sizzle against the fabric of my jumpsuit. I can\u2019t tell how wounded he is through the tattered human suit he\u2019s wearing.</p><p>\u201cHow bad?\u201d March asks, coming up behind me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. I need the knife. Let\u2019s cut him free.\u201d</p><p>March hands me the sonicblade, and I go to work, feeling like a serial killer skinning her victim. Amid all the other smells I detect the faint scent of decomposition. He needed to slough this skin soon anyway.</p><p>\u201cShit, you\u2019re butchering him!\u201d Jael lunges like he\u2019s going to steal the weapon, but March steps in between us.</p><p>\u201cEasy, she knows what she\u2019s doing.\u201d Well, that may be an overstatement. I\u2019ll do my best, though. I always do. \u201cHow\u2019s your gut?\u201d March adds.</p><p>Since I\u2019m slicing off Vel\u2019s faux skin as if peeling fruit, I don\u2019t see his shrug, but I hear it in Jael\u2019s voice. \u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d</p><p>I delve in my jumpsuit pocket and find a fresh torch-tube, crack it so I can better judge the damage. I count a dozen bites on his thorax alone, but they don\u2019t look deep. I need to keep cutting in order to finish assessing his condition. Not that I know what to do about it.</p><p>Why don\u2019t we have Doc with us? Fuck him for being safe on Lachion, puttering around his lab when we need him so bad. I don\u2019t know enough about medicine to save Vel if he\u2019s in critical condition. And Mary curse it, we don\u2019t have much more than a first-aid kit on the ship. There\u2019s a basic med center here on station, though, if we can get to it. The medical AI may know what to do for him; it should possess exobiological treatments.</p><p>As I shift Vel to pull the rapidly rotting flesh away, I count five more bites. His mandible works slowly, and it takes his vocalizer a few seconds to translate it to a pained sound within our hearing range. I could almost cry in relief. In fact, I feel tears stinging at my eyes, but I won\u2019t let them fall.</p><p>\u201cThat would\u2019ve killed most guys,\u201d March observes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not most guys.\u201d Jael kneels beside me, watching the procedure with horrified fascination. Vel\u2019s features flash into sight. \u201cRight then, what the fuck\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t get to ask,\u201d I cut in, \u201cthen you don\u2019t either. This isn\u2019t the time for talk anyway. You two should really figure out a way to get that door open, just in case there are more of them. We\u2019re in no shape to fight.\u201d</p><p>For once, I get the last word, and they both snap to work.</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>While l work on Vel, they jury-rig wires between the terminal and the door. His blood stings my skin, and I spare a moment to hope it won\u2019t kill me, if slower than it does the Morgut. Even if it might, I wouldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>\u201cIf this works,\u201d March says, \u201cit\u2019s going to take out half this room.\u201d</p><p>Doesn\u2019t it figure? Our security guy is laid out while the two mercs, who tend to solve problems with a hammer, take charge of getting us out of here. Vel could probably hit two buttons and get the door to open.</p><p>I resist the urge to stare at Jael, knowing he probably expects it. Everything we know about the Bred comes from rumors from the gutter press, sensational gossip seasoned liberally with speculation. Like an Ithtorian bounty hunter, who ever expects to meet one?</p><p>His wounds appear to be coagulating nicely, but then, I don\u2019t know what to expect, given his physiology. I lack all but basic emergency training. Then again, I can\u2019t blow a security door either.</p><p>\u201cKeep your head down, Jax.\u201d To my surprise, this terse order comes from Jael.</p><p>\u201cMarch, line up some crates in front of Vel, if you can. Give us some cover.\u201d</p><p>He nods to indicate that\u2019s a good idea. \u201cDon\u2019t set it off until we\u2019re settled,\u201d he tells Jael.</p><p>How morbid\u2014the slimy floor provides a ready lubricant, so our makeshift barricade slides easily into place. March crouches beside me.</p><p>\u201cReady,\u201d he calls.</p><p>Instinctively, I bow my body over Vel. Any debris that rains down will catch me in the back. Jael hits the switch to short out the terminal, and the current crackles along the wires, shorting out the electrical lock that holds the door in place. It blows wide with a boom, slamming backward into the corridor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sound shocks Vel awake. I sense the moment he rejoins us, side-set eyes glittering up at me. His mandible moves, and his vocalizer kicks in a few seconds later. \u201cAre you taking advantage of me, Sirantha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that a joke?\u201d Sheepishly I ease off him.</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re out of here,\u201d Jael says. \u201cIs he conscious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Vel answers for himself. \u201cCan you help me up?\u201d</p> <p>Since I was just about to ask if he could walk, I certainly can. Between March and me, we haul him to his feet. As Vel drops a foreleg around my shoulder, not out of affection but from a need for support, I flash back to our hike out on the Teresengi Basin.</p><p>Vel seems to follow the thought because he sounds almost wry. \u201cThis is becoming a rather unfortunate tradition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I murmur, once March and Jael move off to scout ahead. \u201cYou sure got the short straw when they partnered you with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alive,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are those who would\u2019ve left me for dead, dismissing my injuries as too grievous to make me worth the risk of hampered travel.\u201d</p><p>Damned twice over, I don\u2019t know what to say. He receivedthose wounds trying to protect me, and once before, in another life it seems, I considered leaving March after a fight went bad. A wave of nausea washes over me, not because I\u2019m covered in gore, or embracing an Ithtorian, but because I hate that Jax.</p> <p>Does changing for the better absolve you of all the wicked shit you did before?</p><p>No. March fills my head like a warm glow. Instead you receive the twin delights of guilt and regret.</p><p>So he knows then. I\u2019ve always wondered.</p><p>It\u2019s what you do that counts, not what you consider doing.</p><p>He always knows exactly what to say. I swear to Mary, I could be dying, and he\u2019d ease my final jump into the dark.</p><p>I thought we agreed you aren\u2019t going to think like that? But he sounds resigned, as if he knows I\u2019ll never stop thinking about two things: grimspace and my own death. Loving a navigator pretty much guarantees the dual obsession.</p> <p>So far the hallway looks clear. March and Jael round the corner and disappear from sight. Of necessity, Vel and I move slower, but March will warn me if there\u2019s trouble. I\u2019m surprised nobody has asked how I know certain things before now.</p><p>\u201cIf we can find the control room, I can purge the vents,\u201d Vel says.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s a good thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might save our lives.\u201d</p><p>Well, I\u2019m all for that. \u201cClue me in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey prefer a secure enclosure for their nests, and on a station like this, only the ventilation shafts make sense. The Morgut cocoon a corpse along with their eggs, and their larvae eat their way out. The young develop rapidly and could pose a significant threat before help arrives.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. We can\u2019t just drop off Kora, Surge, and baby here, as intended. Anyone with a glimmer of conscience would wait for the cleanup crew to arrive to secure the station, and I\u2019m no exception.</p><p>\u201cSo what happens in this purge?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA burst of superheated air surges through the ducts and is vented into space. It works on a system of locks, so the station doesn\u2019t decompress. They use it to clean debris out that bots can\u2019t manage . . .\u201d Vel hesitates. \u201cAnd on more populous stations, it . . . discourages nomads from taking up residence there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr they wind up cooked and then spaced for vagrancy? Harsh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe universe often is. Had you not noticed?\u201d Yes, there it is again, the hint of humor. Since he\u2019s so formal all the time, it\u2019s difficult to discern, subtle and droll.</p><p>\u201cI catch on slow, but I\u2019m starting to get it.\u201d</p><p>We come around the corner to find the hallway empty. Where the hell did the other two get to? I notice that their blood-smeared tracks simply end, which means they must\u2019ve gone . . . up. Surely March would\u2019ve touched base if trouble hit, though. If he could. If he\u2019s dead or unconscious\u2014</p><p>No. Not thinking that way.</p><p>Though my head is full of images, mainly the Morgut webbing them and hauling them up, I can only deal with one problem at a time. The bounty hunter leans on me harder, and we\u2019ve only walked fifty meters. He needs the med center. In my considered opinion, purging the station can wait until I have him stabilized.</p><p>Plus, a purge might fry March and Jael, wherever the hell they are. Weak and dizzy from blood loss, Vel\u2019s not thinking as fast as usual, or he would\u2019ve noticed by now. Maybe I can keep him from worrying about it.</p><p>Time is ticking. My skin stings, my hip aches, and I can\u2019t use my left hand. Why does shit always come down to me? But maybe I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. Maybe March and Jael are fine.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say aloud. \u201cLet me ask 245 for a sample layout of an emergency station. It won\u2019t be exact, but it might give us an idea where to turn.\u201d</p><p>My PA wouldn\u2019t have helped earlier, because even preciseblueprints don\u2019t include dangerous Morgut nests, more\u2019s the pity. In any case, I didn\u2019t think of her until now. I pull the unit from my pocket, input my codes, and ask for the information I need.</p><p>She actually seems a bit miffed that I don\u2019t have time to chat. Maybe I\u2019ve talked to her too much during our ongoing experiment. Maybe she\u2019s learned a uniquely human trait: loneliness.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says, after a few seconds searching. \u201cAs part of my helpful information database, I have plans for emergency stations. They are designed to aid interstellar travelers in distress. Are you currently in distress, Sirantha Jax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I most certainly am. Can you tell me where medical would be, assuming they didn\u2019t deviate from the standard design?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease wait.\u201d Her new voice rings completely feminine. A few weeks back, while we were confined to quarters, I decided if I talk to her as if she\u2019s my best girlfriend, then she should sound the part.</p><p>Then she flashes the location on-screen. On the plus side, it should be located on this level. On the minus side, it\u2019s on the other side from where we are. That means we have two hallways to cover . . . without getting caught by whatever took March and Jael. I hate thinking like that, but it\u2019s the only thing that makes sense.</p><p>I have to cordon off the terror and pain. Vel\u2019s my responsibility right now. March made him my partner in case we got separated, and I\u2019m not going to let Vel bleed to death while I go tearing around after the other two.</p><p>At this point, I tell myself, it\u2019s better if the remaining Morgut snag March and Jael instead of us. I know that sounds callous, but they\u2019re former mercs. They have a better shot at surviving than we do right now.</p><p>\u201cLet us move,\u201d Vel says. \u201cI do not know how much longer I can stay vertical.\u201d</p><p>One crisis at a time, Jax.</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>The distance seems a lot longer than it actually is.</p><p>I remember Vel mentioning there might be traps laid, so we proceed with care. I try to stay to the edges of the hallway. My shoulders ache from the strain of holding him upright. He\u2019s not helping much anymore, moving on sheer determination.</p><p>If he goes down, I don\u2019t have the strength to get him on his feet again, so we have to keep shuffling toward Med Bay. Or where it ought to be. My PA sulks in my right front pocket; I don\u2019t think she quite grasps the urgency of the situation.</p><p>The silence troubles me. I send a few experimental thoughts toward March, but I get nothing back. It\u2019s more than his lack of response, though. The station itself seems oddly still. Could be my paranoia, I suppose. Maybe nothing\u2019s left but us.</p><p>When we turn the corner into the last hallway, a web snaps down toward us, but we\u2019re not quite in range. We stagger back a few paces while I try to control my heart rate. Lucky they placed the trigger off a few centimeters or we\u2019d be finding out firsthand what became of March and Jael. I suspect they let themselves be taken . . . because it\u2019s more comforting than the other options.</p><p>Why would they do that? I can\u2019t even speculate, unless it sprang from some heroic urge to take on the rest of the Morgut without endangering Vel and me.</p><p>I spare a moment of gratitude that the med center is where 245 predicted. As I suspected, it\u2019s unmanned. Vel collapses on a cot while I commandeer a workstation.</p><p>\u201cPower on.\u201d I hope these aren\u2019t coded to require certain voice patterns. Then again, that wouldn\u2019t make sense, given the budget for these outposts.</p><p>Pure relief surges through me when the screen lights up. \u201cAccess emergency medical database. Seeking treatment for an Ithtorian suffering from multiple bite wounds and blood loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccessing.\u201d This AI sounds cool and collected, which is reassuring in a medical system. \u201cRecommend sonic cleansing and immediate application of liquid skin, type four. Contains antibacterial agents and macrobiotic, further intervention is not required unless patient exhibits signs of infection. Augment treatment with a transfusion of synthetic intravenous fluid, program med-bot to use type 1345AB.\u201d</p><p>Liquid skin. Med-bot. Vel\u2019s gone under again, which is probably best. Thankfully the station provides some guidance as to where I can find things. My hands tremble as I carry out the instructions.</p><p>They keep the med-bot in a cupboard, charging until he\u2019s needed again. He powers up at my voice command, and I\u2019m able to program him with treatment instructions that way as well. In efficient, mechanical motions, he handles the infusion, which should help Vel stay conscious.</p><p>As for me, I suck down a packet of paste. Won\u2019t do any good if I pass out. I\u2019m fucking exhausted, and I ache all over. For good or ill, we\u2019re holed up here until we both feel better. I hope to Mary that March and Jael are all right, but I can\u2019t save them. I just can\u2019t. When they disappeared, I chose to stick with Vel.</p><p>That\u2019s a fucking agonizing decision.</p><p>I love March.</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m abandoning him, but presently he\u2019s not my lover; he can\u2019t be, or I\u2019ll go nuts. As my captain, he gave me an order: Guard Vel\u2019s back. I\u2019ve never been much for authority, but I trust his judgment. So I force my worry down, compartmentalize it. I\u2019m an old pro at that.</p><p>I\u2019d kill to get cleaned up. That\u2019s when I notice the san-shower, probably kept in here so the doc can wash up after dealing with messy injuries.</p><p>I hesitate only a few seconds. \u201cDo you have a quarantine protocol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAffirmative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActivate it and secure the doors. Require my voice imprint to override.\u201d</p><p>\u201cState the name of the attending physician and the nature of the infectious illness for station records, please.\u201d</p><p>Shit. I wrack my brain, hoping it won\u2019t check my name against a credentialed list of physicians. Then I solve the problem. I hope.</p><p>\u201cSaul Solaith, logging a case of advanced Jenner\u2019s retrovirus.\u201d</p><p>The machine pauses, which suggests I was right about the database. \u201cAcknowledged, Dr. Solaith. Activating quarantine. Outside access to medical facility will require your authorization.\u201d</p><p>Heh. Technology often manages to be both brilliant and wonderfully stupid. It apparently doesn\u2019t care that I\u2019m the wrong gender, or maybe it doesn\u2019t register pitch and match it against official records. They run on a shoestring budget in places like Emry, and they wouldn\u2019t have the latest innovations, luckily for me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I take a look around Med Bay, most specifically at the ceiling. It lacks the access panels to the ducts that we encountered in the maintenance room. In here the vents are tiny, not big enough for anything to drop down. I decide it would take a cutting torch to get to us.</p><p>Vel appears to be stable, and the med-bot stands ready, monitoring his vitals. That frees me up to rummage. There\u2019s no point in washing, if I have to put this filthy jumpsuit back on. To my delight I uncover a spare pair of scrubs. If I\u2019m impersonating Doc, I might as well go all the way, right?</p><p>Before I hit the shower, I fiddle with the terminal a little. The comm channel doesn\u2019t respond, however, and I can\u2019t reach the ship. Not that I expected to.</p><p>It seems insanely mundane to strip down and step into the stall, but why is it better for me to sit around covered in blood? If I go running around the station, looking for March and Jael, I may only succeed in getting myself killed. Plus I leave Vel vulnerable. We\u2019re safe here, and we need to stay that way.</p> <p>I refuse to do something stupid. At least that\u2019s what I tell myself as I wash up. I\u2019m just being smart. Aren\u2019t I? I can\u2019t sort good sense from cowardice at this point. Guilt weighs me down too much.</p><p>One thing\u2019s for sure. I\u2019m beating the shit out of March for putting me through this. When he finds us.</p><p>After stepping out of the san-shower, I dress quickly in the castoff clothing. Coming around the partition, I see that Vel has struggled to an upright position. I interpret the clicking of his claws as agitation. The movement slows when he registers my presence. I don\u2019t say anything because I\u2019d freak if he disappeared on me, too.</p><p>\u201cYou have become a medical professional? How long was I out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot more than an hour.\u201d I check the med-bot to confirm.</p> <p>\u201cAny word from the others?\u201d Trust him to strike at the heart of the matter.</p><p>\u201cWe might be the last people left in the universe for all I know,\u201d I answer quietly. \u201cNothing on the comm channel; it appears to have been disabled. And I haven\u2019t heard a peep from March or Jael since you passed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did a nice job patching me up,\u201d he says, ignoring the rest for the moment.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cAnyone could\u2019ve done it. I just followed instructions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone did not.\u201d His rounded eyes glitter as he regards me. I\u2019m used to his natural face now, just wish I could read him better. \u201cYou are a constant surprise to me.\u201d</p><p>Not sure what he means, if he thought I\u2019d dump his unconscious body, first chance I got. No fucking way\u2014while the Morgut can\u2019t eat him, they can sure as shit kill him. I could spout some shit about responsibility, but it\u2019s more than that. I need to acknowledge it.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends,\u201d I say softly. \u201cYou\u2019d do the same for me.\u201d</p><p>He ignores that as if he doesn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cYou look done in, and you must be worried about the others. I will stand watch for a couple hours, Sirantha. Get some rest. When you wake up, we will decide our next step.\u201d</p><p>I hope he doesn\u2019t suggest a purge again. I can\u2019t permit that without knowing the fate of the other two. Yet at the same time, I don\u2019t like the thought of what might be growing within Emry\u2019s bowels.</p><p>\u201cIt seems like we need to head for the systems-control room. See if we can get the bay doors open. We need to warn the others. They can bounce a message to New Terra, explaining the situation and requesting a cleanup crew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d he says with gentle insistence.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s paste in my jumpsuit.\u201d I lie down at last, feeling the tension in my joints pop in celebration.</p><p>\u201cI would rather die.\u201d</p><p>Though we\u2019re a bit more comfortable now, this occasion reminds me of the cave, where we relied on each other once before. Life or death, no second chances.</p> <p>I love March, but Vel is something else entirely. He\u2019s one person I\u2019d trust at my back, no questions asked. Funny how that worked out, considering the Corp hired him to hunt me. I relax, and the minute my eyes close, I\u2019m gone.</p><p>Darkness wins.</p><p>CHAPTER 21</p><p>l don\u2019t know how long l\u2019ve been out, but a thump jerks me out of a fitful sleep.</p><p>My heart thuds as I take stock of my surroundings: cots, cupboards, various bits of equipment. Right. Med Bay, Emry Station. I find Vel at the workstation, zipping through files that mean nothing to me.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answers. \u201cI am trying to get external cameras online, but it is not working. I have no idea who\u2014or what\u2014 is out there. And I cannot seem to open the door.\u201d He pauses with certain ironic inflection. \u201cDr. Solaith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well.\u201d I roll off the narrow bed, feeling somewhat better.</p><p>Jax? Open the door, baby. It\u2019s me. I\u2019m all right.</p><p>A rush of relief nearly deposits me on the floor. I didn\u2019t realize how scared I was until this moment. This silence might have lasted forever. Even as I go to the terminal to deactivate the quarantine, my knees still feel weak.</p><p>\u201cSaul Solaith,\u201d I tell the computer. \u201cRequesting override. Access to medical facility now permitted.\u201d</p><p>Vel cocks his head at me. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer. Instead I turn toward the door and key it open to find March there with a small body in his arms. Jael stands a few paces behind, and they both look as though they\u2019ve been to hell and back. I have no idea how he knew I\u2019d be here, but I\u2019m so happy to see him\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou dick!\u201d Not the first words I thought to speak, but it\u2019s what comes out. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you worried me like that. Thoughtless asshole.\u201d</p><p>March shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019ll explain later. Right now, I need to help her.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when I notice the child\u2019s chest rising and falling. They managed to save someone? A miracle. March heads straight for the med-bot. After he programs it, the droid goes to work on the girl. The tiny little thing can\u2019t be more than four years old. At present, she\u2019s dirty, her hair matted with webs. I can\u2019t tell anything else. Maybe Surge and Kora will foster her.</p><p>\u201cMarch found her.\u201d Jael sounds as if he\u2019s been strangled. He drops down heavily on the cot I just vacated. \u201cWeirdest fragging thing I ever saw. We went through the vents for hours. He\u2019d stop and listen, and then go on again, like he was homing in on her somehow.\u201d</p><p>Yes. That\u2019s exactly what he was doing. And why he couldn\u2019t touch base with me. If he stopped focusing on her thoughts, even for an instant, he might\u2019ve lost her. He couldn\u2019t take that risk, particularly not to reassure me. Sure, I was scared shitless, but I was safe, unlike this poor girl. Once again, March proves he\u2019s a bona fide hero. My anger melts away.</p><p>\u201cThey cocooned her, but the eggs hadn\u2019t hatched yet,\u201d March says then. \u201cShe\u2019s terrified, dehydrated, and malnourished. Can\u2019t imagine what it was like for her.\u201d</p><p>Vel studies me for a moment. Once he has some time to reflect, he\u2019s going to put the pieces together about March\u2019s ability. I just don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do about it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been studying the station grid,\u201d the bounty hunter says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to the sys-control room. I\u2019ll open the interior docking door and purge the vents. Then I\u2019ll head back to the ship. We\u2019ll bounce a message out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re strong enough? Do you need me to go with you?\u201d Just a few hours ago, he passed out on me. But maybe the synth-blood he received provided more of a boost than I realized.</p><p>\u201cI can handle this,\u201d Vel assures me. With that, he slips out.</p><p>Jael has closed his eyes. He seems inert until his lips curve into a faint smile. \u201cThis is the first crew that ever made me feel normal. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>That doesn\u2019t seem to require a response, so I cross to March\u2019s side. He watches the little girl with pained tenderness. I get the feeling he doesn\u2019t really see her at this moment. He\u2019s picturing all the people he failed to save. I fucking hate that expression, so grim and bleak. It hurts me just looking at him.</p><p>\u201cIs she going to be all right?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cShe has a shot now. That\u2019s more than she had before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood work out there today.\u201d That seems to register where nothing else has.</p><p>\u201cThanks. You, too. You did exactly as I hoped you would. You got Vel medical attention and kept safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou scared the shit out of me,\u201d I admit, low.</p><p>March turns to me then and pulls me into his arms. I drop my head onto his chest, even though he\u2019s covered in dried blood. \u201cI know. I took my turn, trust me. You must\u2019ve been asleep when I started trying to find you again, Jax. It was like . . .\u201d He pauses, and I know he\u2019s thinking of when Vel took me. When he thought I was dead. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I put you through that, but I couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say softly. \u201cI just thought, well, I was afraid\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t let me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you two ever finish your own sentences?\u201d Jael asks.</p><p>Shit, I forgot he is here. If he didn\u2019t look so beat-up, I\u2019d hit him. \u201cRarely.\u201d</p><p>I expect him to make some wisecrack, but he merely says, perhaps a touch wistfully, \u201cMust be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has its moments. I\u2019m going to clean up, Jax. Keep an eye on things for me.\u201d He means the girl.</p><p>I nod. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Within a few moments, I hear the san-shower kick in. Until he went quiet, I didn\u2019t realize how much I\u2019d come to count on his presence, wandering in and out of my head. Maybe that sounds crazy, but for a jumper, it\u2019s almost commonplace. I\u2019m used to sharing mind-space.</p><p>Time to take a look at our patient. The med-bot hasn\u2019t noted any problems with her vitals. I suspect she received some of the sedative saliva before going in the cocoon. I hope it doesn\u2019t have any lasting detrimental effects on the nervous system or cognitive functions.</p><p>Dammit. At this point, I\u2019m considering a crash course in medicine. I search through the database for information. I don\u2019t find anything about the residual effects of the saliva, though, probably because the Morgut tend to digest the evidence.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have a Bug with you?\u201d</p><p>In a way, I\u2019m glad Jael chooses to ask about Vel. I\u2019d lie for March, just not sure how well. \u201cHe\u2019s the bounty hunter the Corp hired to track me down when they were trying to pin the Sargasso crash on me. Fortunately, Vel respects the truth more than a payday. Plus they pissed him off when they tried to fry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that would do it,\u201d he agrees without opening his eyes. \u201cIt was rough up there. They snapped us up in a web, pulled us into the ducts, but March still had the blade in hand, so we cut our way out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were more?\u201d I\u2019m not sure if I really want to know.</p><p>\u201cWe killed six up top,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lot tougher than you look.\u201d Duh. I pulled something out of his gut and felt him heal. That may be the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His mouth curves into a half smile. \u201cSo are you.\u201d Jael cracks his eyes open to study me. For the first time I notice they\u2019re a pale, icy blue, like frozen rivers in the Teresengi Basin. \u201cI figured you\u2019d freak when we vanished, but March said no.\u201d He hesitates. \u201cI\u2019ve run with some tough bitches in my day, fought under a couple who were scarier than any men I\u2019ve met, but they were mercs. I\u2019ve never known a civchick to handle herself like you did. You were cool, Jax, dead cool.\u201d</p><p>Is that a compliment? \u201cI\u2019m not at the top of my game right now.\u201d</p><p>His eyes drift closed. \u201cYou should let the bot take a look.\u201d</p><p>As I consider that, the workstation beeps, indicating an incoming transmission. To my surprise, when I accept the message, I find Vel\u2019s face on-screen. \u201cI got the comm channel back online, and I\u2019ve sent a message to Chancellor Tarn, explaining the delay to our mission. He\u2019s promised to get a cleanup crew out here as soon as possible.\u201d Vel pauses. \u201cHis exact words were: \u2018What the devil are you doing at Emry Station! You\u2019re weeks off course!\u2019 He doesn\u2019t seem overly impressed with our heroism, Sirantha.\u201d</p> <p>I snort. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t.\u201d The man\u2019s a politician. They don\u2019t give a shit about the welfare of individuals, only electoral points and obscure polls. A thought occurs to me. \u201cHey, if he cans me, would you serve with another ambassador, Vel?\u201d</p><p>The bounty hunter considers. \u201cNo. From our past dealings, I know you are honest, and I could not bring such assurance to my kinsmen about another candidate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that makes me uniquely qualified, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Talk about job security.</p><p>\u201cIt would seem so. Everything all right there?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cWe may as well choose quarters and get comfortable. It looks like we\u2019re going to be here awhile. Did you get in touch with Dina?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAffirmative. The purge is complete as well. Emry should be secure now.\u201d</p><p>March steps around the partition, looking damp and battered, but inexpressibly dear. \u201cMuch better. How\u2019s our girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill sleeping. How do you feel about station life?\u201d</p><p>He cocks a brow at me. \u201cIt tends to be slow and boring. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re in charge until the cleanup crew arrives.\u201d</p><p>Jael and March swear in unison.</p> <p>CHAPTER 22</p><p>Thus commence the longest days of my life.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing like running an emergency station to make you feel like you\u2019re alone in the universe. At first I live in fear that another Morgut ship will dock, and then I\u2019m afraid New Terra will never send the promised crew.</p><p>By day eight, I\u2019m genuinely worried we\u2019ll be stuck here with dwindling supplies and a couple of kids. Staying much longer will drive me nuts. If I wanted this kind of life, I would\u2019ve stayed where there\u2019s a whole world to move around in. I need new sights and sounds, constant change, in order to keep from feeling twitchy, and the fact that I haven\u2019t jumped in weeks only exacerbates my station fever.</p><p>To make matters worse, March insists on having the med-bot run some tests on me. I suppose it makes sense, but nobody on board can interpret the results, which leaves a diagnosis up to the emergency medical AI. Maybe it\u2019s primitive of me, but I would feel better if Doc were here. I don\u2019t think technology can figure out what\u2019s wrong with me.</p><p>Until it does.</p><p>\u201cAcute degenerative bone disease of unknown origin,\u201d the AI says. \u201cRecommend immediate and aggressive treatment via daily injections of vitamin D3, calcium, and phosphorus. If underlying cause cannot be determined, however, this regimen may provide only limited long-term therapeutic value.\u201d</p><p>Bone disease? Jumpers don\u2019t die of such an old woman\u2019s illness. And I\u2019m not that old. That can\u2019t be right.</p> <p>But a few days ago, the med-bot set the broken bones in my left hand. I\u2019m wearing a small brace now to keep them in place while they heal\u2014and that could take a while. No wonder Kora snapped my fingers like dry twigs.</p><p>March tries to smile, but I can tell he\u2019s troubled. Well, that makes two of us. \u201cTake your medicine. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll feel better in no time.\u201d</p><p>Maybe I don\u2019t always eat right, but there\u2019s no logical reason why I would come up calcium deficient. While undeniably disgusting, nutri-paste provides all necessary nutrients to maintain good health. And I suck down the stuff more than I\u2019d like to admit, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m living off cheap homebrew and sweets.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly trust that thing,\u201d I protest. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a hundred years old. It\u2019ll poison me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sound program, Jax. And that thing saved Tiera and Vel.\u201d</p><p>Tiera is the little girl. She has terrible nightmares, but she took to Kora straightaway. I hope she won\u2019t remember much of this ordeal as she gets older.</p><p>We found the duty roster. Twelve souls died here, including her parents. Tiera doesn\u2019t seem to understand the idea that they\u2019re gone for good. She\u2019s too young to learn something so painful\u2014that sometimes people don\u2019t come back.</p><p>Like always, I think of Kai. Part of me will always ache for him. A divided heart offers a strange sensation. I love March enough to die for him, but I still miss Kai. Is that wrong? Do other people feel like this? Sometimes he feels agonizingly close, as if he\u2019s watching me, as if I could touch him. I never would have believed it possible before. Medical science disproved it. But I\u2019ve seen miracles in my day.</p><p>By his taut expression, March knows what I\u2019m thinking, but he doesn\u2019t say anything. It\u2019s impossible to lie to him, and I wouldn\u2019t want to, even if I could. He has to take me as I am, broken bits and all.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you\u2019re not going to get better by ignoring the problem, and I won\u2019t lose you.\u201d His voice comes out raw.</p><p>Dammit, he\u2019s right. Maybe the workstation itself is a bit antiquated, but the database updates frequently via bounce uplinks. Besides, I do feel like absolute shit. Maybe this will help.</p><p>I sigh. \u201cFine. I refuse to be stupid on principle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says, dark eyes twinkling. \u201cYou always have impeccable reasons for acting like an imbecile.\u201d</p><p>Why do I put up with his shit? I grin reluctantly. \u201cDamn right.\u201d</p><p>With poor grace, I let the droid do its thing. I refuse to linger in Med Bay, though. The bot might decide to turn me into a man.</p><p>\u201cMary forefend,\u201d March says, following me out.</p><p>I have no idea where the others are. With two levels, it\u2019s easy to lose track, but I feel reasonably safe. Vel has done four purges, just to be certain, so if there was anything left in the vents, he fried and then spaced it.</p><p>This isn\u2019t the first station the Morgut have ravaged, and unless the Conglomerate pulls its head out of its collective ass, it won\u2019t be the last. They don\u2019t fear us. They see us as food, and you don\u2019t respect something that lets you eat it.</p><p>I stride along the corridor toward the lift. The dull gray-green walls offer little in the way of cheer, but nobody expects to find that here. This is a last resort, a place nobody comes by choice. Not even the crew that mans it.</p><p>\u201cWhere we going?\u201d he asks, as we step into the tube.</p><p>\u201cUp.\u201d I smile, knowing he hates when I\u2019m cryptic.</p><p>A smile begins in his eyes and works its way down his mouth. \u201cPrivate quarters are located on the second level.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they are.\u201d</p><p>But when we step off, I don\u2019t turn toward them. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s disappointed when I stop outside the training room. We haven\u2019t had sex in quite some while, and now I hesitate. I don\u2019t want him to see me like this, so thin and sickly. I couldn\u2019t bear it if desire transmuted to pity somewhere amid the kissing.</p><p>\u201cThat would never happen,\u201d he assures me.</p><p>\u201cYou say that now.\u201d</p><p>The door slides open to admit me, offering us free use of limited equipment. A serious health enthusiast would be appalled, but I just want to burn off some nervous energy. I feel trapped, as if even my skin\u2019s too small. I need to run until I can\u2019t think about how much I want to jump.</p><p>I miss the colors and the astonishing splendor of the universe rushing through my open mind like wildfire. My chest hurts. If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d call it a cardio problem, but I\u2019ve been through withdrawal before. It\u2019s bad this time, and it\u2019ll get worse. I\u2019ve seen jumpers who opt out devolve into screaming fits before they burn it out of their system, before the memories fade enough to be bearable. The ones who recover make fine teachers.</p><p>I\u2019m sure March would rather I fuck him senseless to help me through this, but I just can\u2019t. Not now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to use the treadmill a bit. You\u2019re welcome to join me if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a metaphor?\u201d he asks. \u201cJust when I think I\u2019m about to get somewhere, you invite me to run in place.\u201d</p><p>I misunderstand deliberately. \u201cIt\u2019s good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d March raises a brow. \u201cI expect certain ascetic brotherhoods would agree with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we talking about again?\u201d I begin my stretches, careful not to look him in the eye.</p><p>\u201cYou know perfectly well.\u201d</p><p>Well, of course I do. He\u2019s my pilot, isn\u2019t he? I just don\u2019t want to deal with it. Avoidance isn\u2019t my style, though. Never has been. I need to bring it out in the open.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d Sufficiently limber, I climb on the machine. It registers my height and weight, and then sets my initial pace accordingly.</p><p>\u201cI want to know what the hell\u2019s going on,\u201d he bites out. \u201cI thought we were\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTogether?\u201d I supply.</p><p>\u201cYes, that. And we make decisions as one, don\u2019t we? When did we decide on celibacy, exactly? I\u2019m dying to touch you.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t look at him as I run, arms curled high against my sides. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a decision. It just happened. First they separated us, and then\u2014\u201d</p><p>I got sick.</p><p>No. I just can\u2019t say that aloud. But he\u2019s strong and fit, whereas I\u2019m fragile. I can\u2019t wade in beside him with a shockstick and a kiss-my-ass smile anymore. I don\u2019t have the stamina or the speed. I can\u2019t be an equal partner to him now. Maybe I never can be again.</p><p>The old Jax wouldn\u2019t have cowered with Vel in the med center. She\u2019d have found a way to do both, somehow. She\u2019d have saved Vel and managed to find March, too. I can rationalize it, but I\u2019ve changed. I\u2019m not up to my old weight.</p><p>Weak.</p><p>Before I can alter the status quo, I need to hear what Doc has to say. It\u2019s not fair to tie March to someone who may have a shorter life expectancy than your typical jumper\u2014and that\u2019s saying a lot. That truth hurts so much that I\u2019ll never be able to speak the words. Not to him.</p><p>But he knows.</p><p>Deliberately, March steps off his machine and heads for the door. Even though I\u2019m not Psi, I feel the pain rolling off him in raw, angry waves. Without turning, he says, \u201cI had no idea you were such a fucking coward, Jax. You think you love me enough to die for me. Big fucking deal; you don\u2019t love me enough to live for me. You\u2019ve quit on us before we ever began.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>CHAPTER 23</p><p>lt\u2019s just like that first time, all over again.</p><p>I\u2019ve finally got what I wanted so bad. Here I sit in the nav chair, ready to jack in, next to a pilot who wants nothing to do with me. I already tried to apologize, but he\u2019s having none of it.</p><p>That scrapes the wrong way since I want to keep us from making a terrible mistake. If I pull back, then hearing the worst will be easier on us both. And if we get good news, then we\u2019ll be dying to get back in bed, anticipation and all that.</p> <p>March thinks I\u2019m full of shit\u2014that I\u2019m inventing reasons to push him away. That\u2019s not true. I just don\u2019t want him to suffer like I did when I lost Kai. I have to know there\u2019s hope before I let this thing between us go any further. So maybe it\u2019s better this way, better if he hates me. He\u2019s so afraid of losing me that he can\u2019t see I\u2019m scared out of my mind, too. I\u2019m trying to be strong.</p><p>How can you miss someone who\u2019s right beside you?</p><p>I put all that aside as we run a systems check and prepare to depart. I\u2019m a professional. Doesn\u2019t matter how I feel, or that my stomach flips like a dying fish at the thought of being part of him again. The desire to jump twines painfully with the desire to jump March.</p><p>This ship vibrates a lot more than the Folly. It\u2019s smaller, for one thing. Not sure if we possess any weapons at all. If we don\u2019t, Dina\u2019ll want to collaborate with Jael on it. I haven\u2019t had a chance to ask if she made any upgrades while we waited.</p><p>All told, we spent fourteen days on Emry Station, but the cavalry has arrived. Surge and family will remain on station, but Jael\u2019s coming with us. I\u2019m not sure we need a gunner on a diplomatic mission, but given my track record, it\u2019s not a terrible idea.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stop on Lachion first,\u201d March says. \u201cDoc needs to see you, and I need to take care of personal business there, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTarn isn\u2019t going to like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll like it less if you drop dead.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019s back to the old March where I\u2019m concerned. It hurts to look at him, so I jack in, though we haven\u2019t left the station. The cockpit disappears.</p><p>We\u2019re waiting for clearance. I\u2019ve already checked the star charts to translate the distance I need to navigate.</p><p>They\u2019ve disabled the automated docking system until they decide what to do about the Morgut threat. I heard them kicking around the idea of having Conglomerate ships outfitted with a special device that signals the system it\u2019s safe. Such technology can be cracked, though. The other solution is requiring the docking bays be manned twenty-four/seven. Either option requires a bigger budget.</p> <p>March gets on the comm, hailing the guys in the office. \u201cWe\u2019re good to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger that. Thanks for everything, Bernard\u2019s Luck. We\u2019d have lost a lot more lives out here if you hadn\u2019t happened by.\u201d</p><p>I feel the lift as we maneuver out. Though I can\u2019t see, I picture March\u2019s hands on the controls. He\u2019s sure and graceful as he flies. I hear him telling the crew to strap in, so we\u2019ll be making the jump soon.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>But I nod, bracing myself for the moment when the universe unfurls. And then March jacks in beside me. Partitioned, of course. He doesn\u2019t want to share anything with me right now. Well, I can do it, too; I\u2019ve learned a lot from him. I won\u2019t give him a damn thing either.</p><p>The ship shudders as the phase drive powers up. Dina reports all clear just before we make the jump, and then the world flashes out.</p><p>Fucking beautiful.</p> <p>My mind expands to infinite space. Grimspace feels like flying, the only place I\u2019m completely free. I sense the beacons, alluring as innumerable heartbeats thudding in time. Somehow there\u2019s harmony in the chaos.</p><p>For a moment, just a moment, I think I might understand everything, but then it shifts to something else and floats away. I can\u2019t hold on to anything here, not even my own soul. The sense that everything\u2019s connected on some level I can\u2019t grasp haunts me. But I\u2019m not here to suss out the secrets of the universe today.</p><p>I just need to find the beacon nearest Lachion. I\u2019ve made this run more than once, so the path comes easy. Funny how March and I can do this so coolly, sharing nothing, where we used to be one mind.</p><p>Well. Funny, like a needle in the eye.</p><p>He knows what grimspace looks like, its mad, consuming beauty. Few people do if they aren\u2019t jumpers themselves. They\u2019ve never managed to develop a camera that can reproduce what it sees, the impossible patterns and oscillations found here.</p><p>I sense the adjustments he makes, guiding the ship in response to my cues. The pulse roars in my ears. We\u2019re here.</p><p>And then I go blind again while the ship trembles its way back into straight space. No wonder mudsiders think spacers are crazy. Anytime we make a long haul, we could be lost forever. Over the years, they\u2019ve reduced the odds considerably, but freighters still vanish now and then. A gamble at good odds is still a gamble.</p><p>Taking care with my bad hand, I unplug. My head hurts, more than it used to when I left. It sucks a little more of my soul each time. There will come a day when I\u2019ll simply be empty. Even if March manages to drag me back again, the next time I cruise too close to burnout\u2014assuming he\u2019d bother now\u2014I\u2019m not sure there would be anything left.</p><p>And I don\u2019t care. Beneath the tired aches, serenity flows through me like a river dammed too long. This is a jumper\u2019s lot. I don\u2019t know how the instructors do it. Since they want me to teach on Lachion, though, I guess I need to figure it out.</p><p>His voice startles me. I thought we wouldn\u2019t be speaking for a while. \u201cWe\u2019ll be there in a couple of hours. You did well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Courtesy feels awkward.</p><p>I want to tell him to go fuck himself if he can\u2019t understand what I\u2019m going through. It\u2019s not all about him. March has abandonment issues, and it\u2019s not my job to soothe them. Just now I can\u2019t muster up the energy.</p><p>\u201cYour fire\u2019s gone out,\u201d March says. \u201cYou used to feel like a live wire, Jax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason for me to step back,\u201d I tell him with a fraction of my old bite. \u201cIf that was what you loved about me, and I\u2019ve lost it, then what\u2019s left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t get it, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>March rakes a hand through his dark hair. Over the past weeks, his has actually gotten longer where mine has stopped growing entirely. He looks rough and a little menacing with the stubble on his jaw.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me here. You\u2019re asking me to leave you the fuck alone just when you need me most. How can I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it easy for you.\u201d I push from the nav chair and duck out of the cockpit. Nothing ever hurt like walking away from him.</p><p>I can\u2019t accept that I\u2019m crazy for asking for time, though. Why can\u2019t he understand that I need some chance to be strong again? I don\u2019t want to lose myself in leaning on him. If I can\u2019t stand on my own two feet when I need to, then I might as well be dead.</p><p>Suddenly my dad\u2019s plan\u2014the Eutha-booth\u2014doesn\u2019t look half-bad.</p><p>Instead of stopping to chat with the others, I pass straight through the hub and head for my quarters. I have two hours to kill. Maybe I\u2019ll dump my problems on 245 and see what she suggests.</p><p>To my vast annoyance, the AI tells me I have company, almost as soon as I flop down on my bunk. As the door slides open, I growl, \u201cI thought I told you to leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>Dina steps back, feigning surprise. \u201cDid you? I didn\u2019t hear for all the bitchy stomping around you\u2019ve been doing for the last few weeks. You need to get laid.\u201d</p><p>I lie back with a sigh. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I need to find out from Doc just how bad off I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re completely fucked,\u201d she says at once, but it\u2019s more of a reflex. \u201cI brought biscuits and choclaste. I thought we could talk about hot guys.\u201d</p><p>That makes me raise up on an elbow. \u201cYou don\u2019t do hot guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do. We can talk hot chicks if it makes you feel better,\u201d she offers. \u201cKora wasn\u2019t my type, but I liked the doc they sent along from New Terra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you did.\u201d Despite my misery, I eat a cookie. \u201cWonder who she pissed off to get that assignment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe punched someone for feeling her up.\u201d Dina grins.</p><p>I raise a brow. \u201cAnd you discovered this while feeling her up?\u201d</p><p>Dina shakes her head as she commandeers the chair beside my workstation. \u201cAfterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Why are you being so nice to me?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cSomeone has to be. You look like a fucking death\u2019s-head.\u201d</p><p>Nobody else on the ship knows. Since she\u2019s a smart woman, she noticed something\u2019s wrong. But she doesn\u2019t know what. It might do me good to confide in a human being for a change, one who isn\u2019t interested in screwing me.</p><p>So I do.</p><p>CHAPTER 24</p><p>Talking with Dina eats up the hours.</p><p>\u201cFuck it,\u201d she says, downing the last biscuit. \u201cWe all die. If Doc can\u2019t sort you out, then go do whatever the hell you like. Don\u2019t waste the time you have left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways thought I\u2019d go out jumping, you know? I think I was meant to, earlier. March called me back.\u201d That spills out before I can stop it.</p><p>She dips her chin, studies her booted feet for a moment. \u201cHe loves you, Mary knows why. I don\u2019t know what you mean to do about it. Not my business, really\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re presuming to advise me about het-sex relationships, even though you don\u2019t know the first thing about them?\u201d I lick my finger and collect some of the crumbs from the cookie plate.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same principle, you stupid twat. You don\u2019t deserve my advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not, but you can\u2019t resist. That way, when I ignore it, you can call me an ignorant bitch later, after I\u2019ve fucked things up beyond all recognition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you\u2019re honest,\u201d she says with a grin. \u201cAnd reasonably self-aware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gift. Go on then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe gentle with him.\u201d Dina sits forward, arms crossed on her knees. \u201cI\u2019ve known him a long time, and I don\u2019t want to see him hurt again.\u201d</p><p>That makes two of us. The silence builds, charged with things I don\u2019t feel able to articulate. Finally, I answer, \u201cNoted.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not nearly enough.</p><p>My first clue that we\u2019ve arrived comes from the bump that signals planetfall. They\u2019ve built a hangar inside the Gunnar-Dahlgren compound, so the merger must be going well. I can\u2019t wait to see Doc, even Lex and Keri for that matter.</p><p>It\u2019s not quite a homecoming. I won\u2019t feel like that until I return to the glastique garret that didn\u2019t have a shower. Inexplicable, the places our hearts tie us to. I miss Adele. She was like the mother I always wanted, not the one I\u2019ve got.</p><p>\u201cWe should get the hell off this ship,\u201d Dina says then.</p><p>With a stretch, she pushes to her feet, leaving the dirty dishes for me to worry about. I grin a little over that. I\u2019d worry if she ever turned up too nice. I might find her laying out my funeral clothes the moment my back was turned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYep.

They don\u2019t need to know about my illness or March\u2019s sense of obligation to the clan. Right now I can understand Dina\u2019s attraction to other women. I\u2019m rather fed up with Y-chromosome bastards myself. I roll off the bed, and my reflected movement prompts me to look in the glass beside my bunk. What I see startles me.</p><p>\u201cNeed to change first. I look like an inmate . . . or a san worker.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cClothes won\u2019t help.\u201d She\u2019s back to mocking me, which I appreciate, because it means she thinks I\u2019m strong enough to take it. I think I\u2019d go back to bed if she became solicitous. \u201cYou need a new head . . . or at least a new face. Maybe Doc\u2019s friend on Gehenna can hook you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrdo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the one. Still, do your best, won\u2019t you? Spackle on some paint, maybe use the wardrober to manufacture a wig. They\u2019re all queued up to see the ambassador from New Terra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are not.\u201d I rummage through my bag, sighing over my meager possessions. Impossible to believe\u2014I used to be something of a clotheshorse. Back in the day, I loved dolling up in short skirts and long boots, tiny tops that showed more of me than they hid. Now I\u2019m hard-pressed to find something that doesn\u2019t make me look as though I repair Skimmers for a living.</p><p>\u201cTarn panicked. He was afraid the Ithtorians would take offense to our meandering progress, so he\u2019s \u2018leaked\u2019 the fact that New Terra\u2019s ambassador is wending her way toward them on a goodwill tour.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>We could go on like this all day, I expect, so I choose not to be juvenile. I know; it stings a bit. \u201cDo I have an itinerary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to inquire of Chancellor Tarn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather make it up as I go along.\u201d I shake my head over the absurdity of the situation. Tarn should have replaced me weeks ago, but he won\u2019t. Because of Vel, I am indispensable. \u201cGet out, or you\u2019re going to see me naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going!\u201d she protests, heading out. Her final words drift back to me as the door slides shut. \u201cYou\u2019re such a stroppy bitch.\u201d</p> <p>Since March just accused me of having lost my spirit, I certainly like the sound of that. Not surprisingly, it takes me a little while to make myself presentable, given the raw material. Finally, I unearth a simple black vest and a pair of skinny black and gray thin-striped slacks.</p><p>I hesitate because the shirt reveals my scars, and then I decide I want it that way. They mean something. That\u2019s why I kept them.</p><p>In the end I take Dina\u2019s suggestion with regard to cosmetics. I paint some color into my complexion and cover up the circles beneath my eyes. I refuse to wear false hair, though. Maybe I\u2019ll start a trend for women who fancy wearing theirs a centimeter long but always lacked the nerve before now. When I emerge from quarters, I find Jael waiting for me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m to be your protection,\u201d he says without preamble. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a laugh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssassination attempts like the one you didn\u2019t report on New Terra. You tried to pass that off as a crash.\u201d</p><p>It takes me a moment to parse what he means. The Skimmer explosion, right. I just wanted off world, didn\u2019t want to wait around for another inquiry. \u201cDid they find the cause? It wasn\u2019t a mechanical fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and no. Scavengers found the parts, but they were confiscated when they tried to fence them. The authorities found the remnants of a primitive incendiary device, assembled from common household items.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo someone definitely tried to murder me.\u201d I feel oddly numb about that.</p><p>\u201cAs a direct result of several lengthy communiqu\u00e9s that bordered on interrogation by the Chancellor, I\u2019m now responsible for preventing them from succeeding. I\u2019ll warn you, Jax. Tarn is paying me well, and I intend to take my job seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been keeping him off my back?\u201d</p><p>I admit it; I\u2019ve been shirking my responsibilities. As a nav-star for Farwan, I had just one. Take my pilot and make my scheduled jumps. That\u2019s all. My life used to include a fair amount of holiday time, and nobody trying to disperse my molecules.</p><p>Different world, different life.</p><p>Jael smiles for the first time, charming when he stops radiating belligerence to compensate for his pretty face. \u201cDone my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had any creds, I\u2019d pay you for that myself. Unfortunately, I\u2019m broke as a joke just now.\u201d</p><p>His smile becomes a grin. \u201cYou don\u2019t need creds. The Conglomerate is picking up your tab, aren\u2019t they? You should charge a bunch of stuff before you lose this gig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talk like that\u2019s inevitable.\u201d What am I saying? I laugh reluctantly because I see his point. I have a solid record for diplomacy in regard to class-P planets. I know how to impress superstitious natives.</p><p>The Ithtorians? Not so much. I hope Vel can save my ass yet again.</p><p>Jael spreads his hands in a defensive gesture. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, buy some new clothes, maybe some sparklies.\u201d</p><p>Tarn\u2019s reaction to my draping myself in diamonds at his expense would be priceless. Despite myself, I rather like this merc\u2019s sense of humor. In some ways he reminds me of Kai: cheerful, cocky, and irreverent.</p><p>\u201cAnyway.\u201d I try to refocus the conversation. \u201cI enjoyed some peace while we waited on Emry, though. I appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll part of the job,\u201d Jael tells me easily. \u201cYou look better, less like you\u2019re about to turn toes up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a smooth talker, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I don\u2019t mean for the words to come out flirtatious. Mary knows, I have enough problems in that regard, and it\u2019s not like he\u2019s interested. He\u2019s just saying I look less like the walking dead, which is a long haul from a true compliment.</p><p>March clears his throat. From his taut expression, he thinks he\u2019s interrupted something. Mary, I\u2019d like to smack him in the head, but at this point, he\u2019d probably take it as foreplay.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this over with,\u201d he mutters.</p><p>He brushes past the two of us without another word, and Jael cocks a brow at me. \u201cTrouble in paradise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to know about my personal life,\u201d I snap at him. \u201cJust go clear the way or whatever bodyguards do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling,\u201d he drawls. \u201cSoon I\u2019ll know everything about you, including how many times you breathe per minute, and if your heartbeat sounds a smidgen off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you know when I . . .\u201d I lean in to whisper the rest.</p><p>\u201cThat depends. Am I in your room at the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Nothing I say fazes him, so I stalk past to the main hatch.</p><p>Great, I need another man poking about in my business.</p><p>Like I need to settle down and study rutabagas.</p><p>CHAPTER 25</p><p>Lachion hasn\u2019t changed a bit.</p><p>Then again, why would it? It hasn\u2019t been as long as it seems since I was here. The horizon stretches pale and endless beyond the compound walls, bounded by dry plains. This place offers extremes\u2014heat or cold\u2014depending on the season.</p><p>After discovering the scary things that live in the caves, the clans stayed because Lachion meant freedom from the Corp. Nobody has ever given a shit about what happens on this planet. Despite the new world order, I don\u2019t see that changing anytime soon.</p><p>To my astonishment, this looks like a formal delegation, not the casual welcoming party I expected. Far cry from the last time I touched down here. And is that the gutter press, lined up behind Keri and Lex?</p><p>Shit, it is. I recognize the guy with the poorly implanted ocular cam. In the old days, he stalked me through spaceport bars, hoping to get a shot of my tits for the midnight bounce. Nice.</p><p>Keri\u2019s smile looks decidedly artificial. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted that you chose Lachion to kick off your interplanetary goodwill tour.\u201d</p><p>A smile tugs hard at the corners of my mouth, and it\u2019s all I can do not to burst out laughing. \u201cOf course. I\u2019d love to see a greater level of governmental participation from the clans.\u201d</p><p>Since freethinkers and outlaws abide here, that will go over like the monkey-pilot experiments from the turn of the century. The clans don\u2019t want to legislate, vote, or pay extra tariffs. For Mary\u2019s sake, they settle grievances in the arena.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss that during your visit,\u201d she responds through gritted teeth.</p><p>I suspect Keri\u2019s going to kick my ass again, which is sad because she\u2019s just over half my age. The girl is tougher than she looks. As I move forward, a barrage of questions greets me.</p><p>\u201cAmbassador, can you tell us anything about your plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about the proposed integration of Ithiss-Tor into the Conglomerate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is your itinerary shrouded in secrecy? Our sources say you may be targeted for retaliatory action from Farwan loyalists or other extremist groups. Is there any truth to those claims?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you comment on the recent rumors that you detoured en route to thwart a Morgut attack on Emry Station?\u201d</p><p>I ignore them all, trying to move forward while the guy with the bulging eye cam watches me like I\u2019m about to yank up my shirt right here. In addition to the fact that those days are behind me, it\u2019s also too damn cold. Why don\u2019t I ever have a coat when I need one?</p><p>March stands somewhere to the right, just behind me, but he won\u2019t be coming to my aid. Yep, just like the last time. I\u2019ve lost track of Dina, but she\u2019s somewhere behind me, and Vel doesn\u2019t like cameras, as they possess a small chance of ferreting out inconsistencies in his appearance that would ID him as nonhuman.</p><p>Jael pushes his way up beside me. \u201cThe ambassador isn\u2019t answering questions at this time. Clear the way.\u201d He looks almost friendly as he says it, but there\u2019s a high shine in his pale eyes that says he wouldn\u2019t mind cracking some heads in time for the midnight bounce.</p><p>As if they sense it as well, the reporters get out of the way. Keri leads my entourage along the drive, her own people straggling behind. Five of them wear purple arm-bands; I\u2019m not exactly sure what that means.</p><p>When we\u2019ve left earshot, she mutters, \u201cYou always bring trouble, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone needs a hobby.\u201d I used to say that to March in regard to thinking about my own death. Does that mean I\u2019ve made emotional progress?</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019d consider horticulture.\u201d</p><p>Outbuildings line the path to the main house, an old-fashioned stone structure. The wire-and-steel security fence crackles, reminding me why it\u2019s there: to keep the monsters out. Remembering that endless night where so many people died, I stifle my smart-ass reply.</p><p>A while back, March liberated me from my cell, after the crash of the Sargasso. He saved me from a lifetime of torment and delivered me to Lachion, where I was intended to help Clan Dahlgren start a renegade jump-training academy. Unfortunately, their rivals, Clan Gunnar, wanted to get their hands on me as well. Anyone who controlled a supply of jumpers would possess an edge\u2014 and on more than just a planetary scale. So they came at us on the ground, forced us to stop. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tired of being jerked around, I started a melee between the clans right out in the open, not knowing that blood would draw the Teras, awful winged monsters that sweep across the plains like a plague, eating everything in sight. And because of an evolutionary boon, you can\u2019t see them coming\u2014just hear the sound of their wings.</p><p>Despite my best intentions, I can still hear the Gunnar warriors screaming as they were swept away on that hungry tide, an unseen army of claws and talons rushing around me in the dark. I shiver. No more thinking of that. Not now. It\u2019s safe here behind the electrical perimeter, and nobody is bleeding.</p><p>I make myself smile at Keri. \u201cI swear I didn\u2019t intend for this to turn into such a\u2014Doc!\u201d I spot him about thirty meters out and take off at a dead run.</p><p>Part of me had worried I\u2019d never see him again. What if Vel had lied about leaving him in a trunk when he took his place? That\u2019s how the bounty hunter managed to snag me; he pretended to be Doc. So there\u2019s some truth to the Syndicate\u2019s worry that Sliders\u2014a human slang term for Ithtorians, or Bugs, as they\u2019re also called\u2014present a threat to our way of life.</p> <p>But Vel didn\u2019t lie. There Doc stands, solid and sturdy, still wearing his salt-and-pepper goatee, and his hair shorn close to his skull. Come to that, we have the same haircut now.</p><p>He breaks into a broad smile and meets me halfway. His hug practically pulverizes my ribs, but I don\u2019t care. My eyes sting. Doc was the first one to treat me like I wasn\u2019t dangerous or criminally insane, responsible for the lost lives on the Sargasso. I\u2019ll never forget him for that.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d I say shakily. This probably isn\u2019t ambassadorial behavior, but I don\u2019t give a shit. \u201cYou\u2019re really all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Jax. Good to see you, too. Er, you can let go now.\u201d Yep, it\u2019s definitely Doc. I expect him to comment on my fragile appearance, but he has more tact than that. I\u2019ve been surrounded by the likes of March, Dina, and Jael too long.</p><p>My bodyguard says, \u201cThey\u2019ll have you on the news, speculating about an illicit affair with him, by morning. Possible impropriety by the New Terran ambassador?\u201d he intones, just like one of the talking heads.</p> <p>\u201cPlease. Nobody cares.\u201d But I step back nonetheless.</p><p>Doc scans all our faces and seems to focus on Vel. \u201cYou. I believe you mistook me for luggage on our last meeting.\u201d</p><p>Since Vel looks like everyone and no one, it\u2019s a logical leap, and Doc excels in that area. I can\u2019t imagine what he makes of the situation we currently find ourselves in. Hopefully, he\u2019ll be able to help me. I can\u2019t think too long about the possibilities otherwise.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that.\u201d I must say, Vel doesn\u2019t look sorry. \u201cFarwan supplied me with erroneous information.\u201d</p><p>For a long, tense moment, I think cool, calm pacifist Doc might sock the bounty hunter in the nose. Then he says, \u201cI suppose everyone makes mistakes. Let\u2019s go inside, shall we?\u201d</p><p>The gutter press follows at a discreet distance, filming the whole time. I\u2019d suggest feeding them to the Teras, but that might strike a sore spot with Keri. I\u2019ve already hurt the poor girl enough.</p> <p>March throws brooding looks over his shoulder now and then. I bet he\u2019d like to pound them on principle. Mary, I don\u2019t know what to do about that. I know I\u2019m hurting him. And I want him; I miss him. But I can\u2019t let myself need him, not because I\u2019m physically incapacitated. And if he doesn\u2019t understand that, then he doesn\u2019t know me at all.</p><p>Just from this short walk, my fingertips have gone numb, the icy wind ripping right through me. When I picked out the vest, I forgot it was still winter here. Time is fluid, so the moments where everything feels perfect pass in a wink, and those where you\u2019re on your knees in despair drag on like the death of a thousand cuts.</p><p>As if he notices my discomfort, Jael presses up against my right side in a manner that\u2019s destined to provoke March in the worst way. The merc can be such an asshole\u2014he\u2019s just doing it for the entertainment value. I pretend I don\u2019t notice either of them.</p><p>Fucking men.</p><p>We pass into the warmth of the house and shut ourselves away from prying eyes. I hope. I muster a smile, even though I\u2019m already tired as hell. Yeah, just from that short hike. Couldn\u2019t have been more than half a kilometer.</p><p>Keri\u2019s home is lovely as ever, with all the elegance that surprised me the first time I visited. The place possesses the old-world charm of handcrafted moldings, shimmering marble tiles, and carpets so thick I\u2019m afraid to walk on them. They\u2019ve redone the foyer since I was here last, though: red and black now, a little more foreboding than the chilly silver and white elegance her grandmother had favored.</p><p>The tiles form a pattern I can\u2019t identify, though I\u2019ve seen it somewhere before. I stare down, absently rubbing my hands up and down my biceps. Up the stairs, she offers capacious guest suites, and hallways lead in either direction. An enormous silver-gilt mirror with acid-etched leaves dominates the far wall, offering distorted hints of the people standing in the foyer. I can\u2019t help but shiver, as if we\u2019ve been granted a glimpse into the afterlife, nothing but vague shapes and shadows.</p><p>\u201cLooks beautiful,\u201d March says. \u201cIt\u2019s completely you, Keri.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Her cheeks pink with delicate color as she turns toward him.</p><p>Just like that, she forgets me. I\u2019d also forgotten the huge, unrequited crush she had on March the last time we stopped here. The little darling\u2014she\u2019s all of nineteen, fights like a chi master, and had started to learn advanced feats before her grandmother passed away. On top of all that, at her age, she acts as joint chieftain to her clan. Keri has smooth skin, a sylph\u2019s shape, a spill of night-dark hair, and eyes that gleam like pale jade. And by March\u2019s smiles, he\u2019s noticing for the first time how lovely his mentor\u2019s granddaughter has grown to be.</p><p>I fucking hate the bitch.</p><p>CHAPTER 26</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Lex?\u201d That\u2019s one question sure to snap Keri out of the March-induced daze she currently enjoys. Lex is the big lug she\u2019s supposed to marry as part of the clan merger. To say she hates him would be an understatement.</p><p>She spears me with an icy stare and bares her teeth in what would be considered a hostile act on some worlds. \u201cWar council. You came at a bad time, Jax.\u201d</p><p>What else is new?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d March asks.</p><p>I recognize his solicitous tone and barely manage to keep from rolling my eyes. He thinks Keri is delicate and needs his protection. I\u2019m sure he feels some obligation as well, given that Keri\u2019s grandmother took him in when his gift had ravaged him and taught him to be human again. And Keri is all that his mentor left behind. I guess he doesn\u2019t know that Keri whipped my ass without breaking a sweat.</p><p>Beside me, Jael sizes up Keri\u2019s men, as if he suspects any situation I\u2019m involved in could turn ugly on a moment\u2019s notice. I didn\u2019t realize he knew me that well.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad. I\u2019ll tell you about it on the way. I\u2019m sure Lex will want to see you.\u201d With a definite proprietary air, she takes hold of his arm. \u201cSaul,\u201d she adds over her shoulder to Doc. \u201cCan you get everyone else settled for me? Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Her honor guard, or whatever the hell they are, spins as a unit and follows her down the left hallway. None of them said a single word from the time we met her outside the ship, until now. Fucking creepy.</p><p>\u201cThey move like military,\u201d Jael murmurs. \u201cWell trained, too. I wonder what\u2019s happening on this backwater world.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cHard to say. They\u2019re always fighting over something here. I think it cuts down on boredom.\u201d</p><p>Doc favors me with a piercing look. \u201cDon\u2019t be flip, Jax. When two clans join, it\u2019s time to strike. It\u2019s well-known here, both clans are weak, or they wouldn\u2019t need a merger. Waiting until things are stable doesn\u2019t make good tactical sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point, though?\u201d Jael asks. \u201cFrom what I saw, the whole planet is pretty bare. What the hell is there worth fighting over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGunnar-Dahlgren controls the magnesium mines on planet,\u201d Doc answers briefly. \u201cI probably don\u2019t need to outline all the goods that encompasses.\u201d</p><p>In my case, he does. But Jael nods, ticking them off his fingertips. \u201cFlash grenades, imaging technology, pyrotechnics for festivals, certain metal alloys, which translates to machinery that needs to be strong and lightweight\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s used in some medicines as well,\u201d Doc says with a nod. \u201cAnd if we can\u2019t defend the mines, they\u2019ll wipe us out.\u201d</p><p>Us? I didn\u2019t realize Doc was from Lachion. Based on his friendship with Ordo Carvati on Gehenna, I would\u2019ve guessed he came from the Outskirts somewhere.</p><p>I sigh. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand what I\u2019d done the last time I was here.\u201d</p><p>Not really, anyway. I didn\u2019t have anything like the big picture, even when we left. Keri has been fighting her own uphill battle ever since we left. And by the look of things, it\u2019s not getting any easier.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you ever know what you\u2019re doing, Jax?\u201d Dina grins at me.</p><p>Ignoring that, Doc tries to herd us toward the stairs. \u201cYou can pick out the rooms you like best. Perhaps you\u2019d like the one you occupied last time, Jax?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, I like the Blue Room, very serene, and it has handmade rugs so soft I sink into them. \u201cSure, that sounds fine.\u201d</p><p>At this point, I notice that Vel has disappeared. I wonder if he has camo that I don\u2019t know about because he has a habit of doing that: there one minute and gone the next. He can take care of himself, though.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. Assign me whatever.\u201d Dina sighs. \u201cIf I can find parts and mod kits, I\u2019m heading back to the ship. I have work to do.\u201d</p><p>Jael surprises me\u2014and evidently Dina as well, judging by her expression\u2014by asking, \u201cNeed help?\u201d</p><p>She narrows her eyes on him for a long moment before shrugging. \u201cThe ship needs a lot of upgrades. So if you know how to handle your tools, I won\u2019t say no to an extra hand.\u201d</p><p>The merc risks his life by draping an arm about her shoulders. \u201cDarling, I\u2019m expert with my hands.\u201d</p><p>She shocks me when she doesn\u2019t immediately drive her elbow into his stomach. I can\u2019t believe he still flirts with her, even knowing he has no shot. Maybe he suffers from a chronic disorder. I expected he\u2019d stick to me like glue after the lecture he just gave me, but I\u2019m glad to get rid of him. As they go back out into the cold, I hear her reply, \u201cYour own opinion doesn\u2019t count, dumb-ass.\u201d</p><p>That just leaves Doc and me. To avoid the questions in his very kind eyes, I head up the stairs. I should have known that wouldn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Jax?\u201d</p><p>I pause on the fourth step, but don\u2019t turn. \u201cI was hoping you could tell me. That\u2019s part of why we\u2019re here. Tarn cooked up this other nonsense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI deduced as much,\u201d he tells me.</p><p>Without looking at him, I confide the droid\u2019s diagnosis. I expect him to laugh or tell me it\u2019s ridiculous. Instead I receive silence that lasts until I wheel and gaze down at him. He looks troubled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wish I could say I\u2019m surprised, but I found a number of anomalies in your test results that puzzled me. If my hypothesis holds true, then this would explain everything. Let\u2019s get you to the lab then.\u201d Doc tilts his head toward the right corridor, opposite from the way March went with Keri.</p><p>Hypothesis? This is my life, not a science project. I like Doc, but sometimes I think he doesn\u2019t realize that I\u2019m more than an \u201cinteresting specimen.\u201d He\u2019s the only one I trust to help me, though, so I have to accept his bedside manner.</p><p>I come down again and fall into step with him.

We move off toward his research facility, but before we\u2019ve gone ten paces, the lights flicker, as if somewhere, someone has drawn an absurd amount of power.</p><p>Doc breaks into a run. \u201cHurry, Jax. We don\u2019t have much time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBefore what?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t pause to answer. I trot behind him nonetheless because Doc isn\u2019t one to manufacture crises. We\u2019ve just reached the door to his lab, which is oddly\u2014and ominously\u2014made of reinforced metal, when I hear screaming.</p><p>\u201cDoc?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet inside. Now.\u201d</p><p>I do, and he seals the door. \u201cYou want to tell me what\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTeras,\u201d he says briefly.</p><p>Just the word alone sends a cold shock through me: hideous subterranean creatures you can\u2019t see coming. Just hear the rush of their wings through endless night. And once the dying starts . . .</p><p>With some effort, I shake myself out of it. I rub my hands together, trying to warm them. We survived them once, and we\u2019re safe inside this time. It should be fine.</p><p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t deduced how, but Clan McCullough has figured out a way to train . . .\u201d He pauses, listening to the distant sounds of combat, cries of rage and pain. \u201cWell, if not train, then use the Teras. They seem to strike on command now. It\u2019s not safe to leave the compound. They hit us at all hours, no rhyme or reason to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t the shock field help?\u201d I remember the way they fried the monsters. The smell the next morning nearly did me in.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t keep it up all the time,\u201d he says tiredly. \u201cNot enough juice. We run on solar panels and wind turbines, mostly the latter during the winter. Gunnar-Dahlgren is officially at war, Jax. Clan McCullough wants everything we have, and with the Teras on their side, they think they\u2019ve figured out a way to get it.\u201d He sighs. \u201cI\u2019m not sure they\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>No wonder Keri said I came at a bad time.</p><p>\u201cI guess jump research isn\u2019t at your top priority at the moment.\u201d</p><p>He manages a wan smile. \u201cNo, they\u2019ve got me trying to sort out why the Teras are attacking like this instead of their usual feeding patterns. We\u2019re weakening by the day, and I don\u2019t think the McCulloughs have lost a single man.\u201d</p><p>How do you fight when you can\u2019t see your enemies? It would take bioengineered poisons or type-three battle droids to clean this planet out. I have no idea how the loss of the Teras would impact the planetary ecosystems either.</p><p>\u201cDo you have the resources to build battle droids with heat imaging?\u201d Lame, I know. I remember the way the Teras dismantled the Rover. Could they find their way into the main house as easily? Are there weak spots?</p><p>Doc shakes his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way things were done here. The McCullough has changed everything. He doesn\u2019t risk his own men or his own life for a hostile takeover. Instead he\u2019s killing us by centimeters.\u201d</p><p>Again, I find myself cowering while others take the risks on my behalf. That stings like nothing ever has. No. I won\u2019t do this. Not again.</p> <p>March is out there. Jael. Dina. March. I have to help them.</p><p>I stride over to the door, tap on the panel. \u201cIf it\u2019s that bad, I should go see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t get out,\u201d Doc tells me. \u201cThe doors are sealed until the attack ends. And I\u2019m not going to release you when you\u2019re clearly ill.\u201d</p><p>Bastard. Is he trying to make me feel useless? My hands curl into fists, but who am I going to hit? Doc? He won\u2019t fight back. Nothing like impotent anger to make you feel ineffectual.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I bite out. \u201cIf I\u2019d known, I wouldn\u2019t have come in here with you, though. I can\u2019t believe you tricked me into hiding out.\u201d</p><p>Again. I hate this. I\u2019ve got to find some way out of here, or I\u2019ll never be able to live with myself. I can\u2019t devolve back into the selfish bitch who doesn\u2019t care whose ass is on the line so long as it isn\u2019t her own. I won\u2019t let fear become my mistress.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says gently. \u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t tell you. Try to ignore the noise. It\u2019ll be over soon. They never stay long; not sure why that is either. If I can put the pieces together, we might have a chance, even weakened as we are. At any rate, let\u2019s get started on your tests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen cure me. Or kill me. Because I can\u2019t live like this.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 27</p><p>Soon as Doc looks away, l lunge toward the emergency</p><p>override panel. Unfortunately, I\u2019m not as fast or agile as I used to be, and he wheels round to catch my wrist. He radiates frustration, but before he can yell at me, a boom sounds.</p><p>The whole house shakes.</p><p>I hit the floor, expecting the roof to come down on me. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Lachion was prone to quakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Doc says grimly. \u201cThey\u2019re bombarding us.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not even sure what that means. For a moment, I envision Clan McCullough dropping giant rocks on us. \u201cThey\u2019re what?\u201d</p><p>On his hands and knees beneath the exam table with me, he looks as though he\u2019s considering one of his university-style explanations. Then he shakes his head. \u201cThis is a hostile takeover, Jax. Welcome to stage two.\u201d</p><p>Shit. We did come at a bad time.</p><p>Between Teras who attack on command and the McCullough war machines, things don\u2019t look good. Oh, Mary, I might never see March again. Dread threatens to close off my throat. It can\u2019t end here, before I can make him understand.</p><p>\u201cI guess we were lucky to land before they struck.\u201d</p><p>He stays low, duckwalking toward the back of the lab. \u201cI suspect your arrival prompted them to step up the attack. They can\u2019t take the chance the ship carried reinforcements, or that the Conglomerate means to interfere with local politics. You\u2019re not just Jax anymore, Ambassador. Not that you were ever \u2018just\u2019 anything.\u201d</p><p>He can\u2019t be serious. I did this by showing up? I am the fucking butterfly, causing ripples everywhere I go.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tiny little cutter,\u201d I protest, crawling after him. Wherever he\u2019s going, I\u2019m headed there, too. We weave around a tall metal cylinder that quivers like it wants to crush my spine. \u201cWhat the hell could we possibly haul? And it\u2019s not like we could\u2019ve carried many mercs in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fair number of Threshers would fit into the cargo hold,\u201d he answers over his shoulder.</p><p>The McCulloughs hit us again, and this time, the walls tremble. Dust spills from the ceiling, powdering my head. Not far away, something collapses. Mary curse it, I hope Doc has a plan.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve brought Threshers,\u201d I say, \u201cif I\u2019d known you were at war.\u201d</p><p>Made by Veratech, Threshers represent the gold standard in killing machines for terrestrial combat. I couldn\u2019t have afforded them, but he doesn\u2019t need to know that. Let my financial embarrassment die with me.</p><p>\u201cKeri tried to tell you. Didn\u2019t her message go through?\u201d</p><p>I remember the way it hissed and cut out. \u201cNot all of it. Not the crucial bit. We thought there might\u2019ve been a problem with the bounce-relay. It\u2019s never stable here.\u201d</p><p>The freedom of a backwater planet also comes with a certain amount of technological disadvantage. There\u2019s no grid in place, no warning system for natural disasters, and no help forthcoming if people get in trouble. To the folks who live here, that\u2019s a plus.</p><p>Advance teams told Farwan that Lachion offered nothing special in the way of natural resources, no money to be made via exploitation, so they packed up and left the place to the settlers. That\u2019s why the Corp called this place a frontier world and paid them no mind. So for the last fifty turns, the Clans have policed themselves and made it up as they went along.</p><p>Another hit sends me sprawling. As he rights me in a casual motion, I note the pack slung across his shoulder. Doc pushes a heavy piece of equipment over to the side with the sheer physical strength that never ceases to amaze me. Head down, he looks like a short, squat ox.</p><p>\u201cPlan B,\u201d he says.</p><p>That happens to be a small escape hatch built into the floor. The house will come down around our ears if we don\u2019t get a move on. Even so, I hesitate to skin down the ladder after him, gazing into a vertical shaft that measures less than a meter. He descends carefully to accommodate his shoulders.</p><p>Soon he disappears from sight. A cold sweat breaks out over me, but I don\u2019t make the leap onto the skinny little ladder until another boom threatens to collapse the ceiling on me.</p><p>\u201cClose it!\u201d Doc shouts, an echo inflating his voice.</p><p>I yank on the short chain to seal us off from the surface world. The light vanishes. My hands feel slippery on the rungs, and I can taste the dark, thick as rancid meat grease.</p><p>Down one step. I can do this.</p><p>The shaft shudders. Overhead, huge chunks of rubble slam against the trapdoor. If I hadn\u2019t moved, I\u2019d be crushed up there, along with all of Doc\u2019s expensive equipment.</p><p>We\u2019re buried alive.</p><p>Pure terror paralyzes me. They\u2019re going to find my bones on this ladder, twenty turns from now. Trembling, I remember the Sargasso, how I felt while buried in the wreckage.</p><p>Why isn\u2019t March here? He promised, damn him. He said I\u2019ll always come for you. That probably doesn\u2019t hold true anymore, though. If it ever did.</p><p>What a dickhead. Why couldn\u2019t he understand I just needed some time? Anger, even the manufactured variety, lends me some strength, but it\u2019s not quite enough. I can\u2019t make myself move.</p><p>\u201cJax?\u201d I can\u2019t see him, but I hear sympathy and understanding in his voice. \u201cOne step at a time. Closing your eyes might help. Forget about the dark.\u201d</p><p>How embarrassing. He knows. Sirantha Jax, afraid of the dark. Nonetheless, I take his advice and squeeze my eyelids shut. Feel my way down.</p><p>Somewhere along the way, I miss a rung, but I don\u2019t fall far. Solid as a brick wall, Doc\u2019s placed to catch me. I think he could hold a baby elephant. He holds me for a moment, effortlessly, while we listen to the sky falling above us.</p><p>I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just my imagination, but I swear I can hear the rustle of wings. \u201cIs this a good idea? I mean, don\u2019t the Teras live underground?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClan Dahlgren dug the bunkers,\u201d he assures me. \u201cAnd secured them. They don\u2019t connect to the natural caverns where the Teras make their home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>I remember what he said about magnesium mines. You couldn\u2019t pay me enough to work down there. Or maybe it\u2019s all automated, like some of the moon mining facilities, just a skeleton crew to oversee and repair the droids. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Doc sets me on my own feet and cracks a torch-tube. I\u2019ve never been so glad to see chemicals mixing. Soon the ambient light bathes our faces in a sickly yellow-green glow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid your tests will have to wait.\u201d</p><p>Really? I thought you\u2019d produce a pocket lab and cure me this minute. Somehow I manage not to snap at him. He\u2019s the only thing standing between me and madness down here.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I gathered that. Where do these tunnels lead?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo the main bunker. It\u2019s a honeycomb, and unless you know the way, you could wander for days and never find the way in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s the idea.\u201d I fall behind him, keeping one hand on his shoulder. I don\u2019t care if he thinks I\u2019m touchy-feely, overly familiar, or just scared shitless. The latter is true, and he\u2019s seen me melt down before.</p><p>\u201cExactly. This is our final fallback. They can reduce the compound to rubble, but they\u2019ll never find us.\u201d He sounds so calm at the prospect of living for an undisclosed period of time below ground.</p><p>The very idea makes me sweat. I can smell my fear, sour and sickly. My fingers trail along the sides of the tunnel as we move, puffs of powder drifting into the wan light. I fall quiet, listening to our footsteps scrape over the dry stone. Time slows, becomes impossible to measure.</p><p>Just Doc and me, surrounded by an island of night. I want to hide my face against his broad back. Instead I walk on, trying to think of this as a test. If I come out of it unscathed, I\u2019ll be stronger.</p> <p>At least there are no Morgut down here.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long we\u2019ve been walking, but my throat aches. So I tug on his pack. \u201cDo you have any water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I should\u2019ve offered. Let\u2019s rest a moment.\u201d</p><p>There isn\u2019t room for us to relax, but I sink down onto the tunnel floor and take a long drink from the lukewarm water in his flask. He probably has paste, too, but I can\u2019t face the thought of it, not yet. I\u2019m simply not hungry enough.</p><p>If I was paying Jael, I would so fire him for leaving me with a pacifist to protect me. I hope he\u2019s all right. Dina and Vel, too. I can\u2019t think about March. My stomach wants to tie itself in knots over him, and I have to stay calm. It\u2019d be far too easy to lose myself in the dark.</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut to combat the panic boiling up in my throat. Steel bands tighten around my rib cage, making it hard to breathe. I swear the walls are getting closer together.</p> <p>\u201cEasy, Jax.\u201d Doc tugs me to my feet. \u201cWe need to keep moving.\u201d</p><p>So we do. More trudging. I\u2019m just about to ask for a packet of that disgusting paste when the torch-tube flickers. Hope to Mary he has a replacement. I can\u2019t walk in the dark. As it is, I\u2019m barely hanging on. The solid rock above me registers as a tangible, menacing presence. Our tomb.</p><p>We come up against a dead end. Shit. Doc doesn\u2019t know this honeycomb as well as he thought he did. We\u2019re lost.</p><p>I can\u2019t take this. I need the open sky. Need to see the stars and feel the wind on my face. I need to jump. This isn\u2019t where I\u2019m supposed to die.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d I ask finally. \u201cWe can\u2019t stay holed up forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuerilla war,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThe monsters can\u2019t serve the McCulloughs in here, nor will their killing machines. So they\u2019ll come looking eventually. They can\u2019t claim clan assets as long as either chieftain lives. When they make that mistake, we\u2019ll kill them, one by one. Keri\u2019s trained her men for tunnel fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t they just starve you out?\u201d</p><p>In answer, he depresses a hidden button in the wall and the door to another world swings open.</p> <p>CHAPTER 28</p><p>There\u2019s an entire city hidden here.</p><p>Well, on second glance, it\u2019s more of a scavenged, retrofitted, grungy underground settlement. The survivors have pitched tents and set up chemical heaters. Here and there, I see salvaged ship parts doing double duty as furniture. A couple of dirty-faced kids bounce on a broken nav chair.</p><p>They pause as we pass by, whispering. Then one of them calls, \u201cDoc! The Dahlgren\u2019s looking for you.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cI\u2019ll find her. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll never get used to the way her clan refers to Keri. My breath comes easier as I register a ceiling so high I can\u2019t even see it. I\u2019ll never take the open sky for granted again, though. Ambient noise gives the space a low roar, part people, part machinery, and the air smells faintly of spices, like someone is cooking.</p><p>The kids giggle and whisper a little more, and then: \u201cSo is Rose!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s alive?\u201d he breathes. \u201cShe made it! Where?\u201d</p><p>They point. To my surprise, Doc alters course, practicallyrunning. March better be down here somewhere, or I\u2019ll never forgive him. Or myself.</p><p>I\u2019m not Psi, so this is probably pointless, but I build his face in my mind\u2019s eye, feature by feature, and focus on him. All my fear, yearning, and need, I bundle up and send outward, hoping he\u2019ll sense it.</p><p>Silence answers me.</p><p>Shoulders slumped, I follow Doc through the throng. Everyone looks tired, worn. In the far corner, they\u2019ve set up an infirmary, rows of bodies on blankets. Blood. The tang of antiseptic. It\u2019s all so astonishingly primitive that I can\u2019t believe people choose to live like this. But folks do crazy things in the name of freedom.</p><p>Naturally, Doc heads straight over. Two Dahlgrens are trying to patch up the wounded, administer treatments and medicine. A weary-looking woman with a sweet face, capped by red-and-silver-streaked hair, greets him with a kiss. Not a polite one either. She melts against him in a way that makes me look away, a private moment flaunted. I guess I know now what keeps him on Lachion.</p><p>\u201cThis is Rose,\u201d Doc says, drawing my eyes back.</p><p>I manage a smile. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikewise.\u201d Her tone is cool, and I sense she wants to be rid of me.</p><p>Doc adds, \u201cShe could use my help here, but I\u2019m sure you want to find the rest of the crew as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, I leave my fear unspoken. \u201cThanks for seeing me through the tunnel.\u201d</p><p>I part from him there and thread my way through the camp, searching through the smoky, intermittent light. In here it feels like perpetual twilight, faces emerging out of the shadows to peer at me, startled and curious. All strangers, all clansmen.</p><p>I find Vel first. He sits apart from everyone else, of course, watching them eat. I hurry toward him, remembering not to hug just before I grab him. That leaves me standing there, not knowing what to do with my hands.</p><p>He gets to his feet in a motion that doesn\u2019t entirely ring true as human, now that I know what to look for. To my surprise, he does the hugging, awkward and tentative, like a dance step he isn\u2019t sure he\u2019s mastered. And he doesn\u2019t have it quite right either. His hands cup the back of my head, smoothing my shorn hair as if I\u2019m a baby bird with ruffled feathers.</p><p>It\u2019s oddly comforting. Even though I know what he is under the skin, it doesn\u2019t matter. In fact, I register awe at his versatility; the ability to assimilate new customs seems enviable.</p><p>\u201cOur situation is less than ideal,\u201d he says, when I finally step back.</p><p>I have to smile. Typical Velith statement. He probably thought it a \u201ctrifle inconvenient\u201d when we were holed up in a cave on the Teresengi Basin.</p><p>\u201cYou can say that again.\u201d</p><p>He cocks his head at me. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Right, he tends to be literal. \u201cNever mind. Have you seen the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I made one sweep before settling here. Are you hungry?\u201d</p><p>I am, actually. \u201cIs it real food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS-meat with potatoes and peppers,\u201d he answers. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to eat something. They\u2019re closing up in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>That decides the matter. I take a bowl and get in line behind the other stragglers. Short and gristly, the woman scraping food from the grill looks a little like Keri\u2019s grandmother, the clan matriarch who sacrificed herself for us. She narrows her eyes on me.</p><p>\u201cIn case you don\u2019t know how this works,\u201d she snaps at me, \u201cthat bowl is yours now, Ambassador.\u201d Her tone gains an ugly stress. \u201cKeep up with it, and keep it clean, or you don\u2019t eat. You\u2019re just like everyone else down here.\u201d</p><p>For Mary\u2019s sake. I\u2019m steaming by the time I rejoin Vel in the far corner. They act like I\u2019ve put on airs and demanded all kinds of special treatment when in fact we\u2019d barely landed before all hell broke loose.</p><p>As I sit, I realize I have no utensils, so I take a quick look around to see what everyone else is doing. They use their fingers to scoop the food into their mouths, which seems basic enough. It\u2019s messy, but practical.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it like out there, Vel?\u201d I have to know. My imagination will create a thousand terrible scenarios to torment me otherwise. \u201cI was in the lab with Doc.\u201d</p><p>He steeples his hands in a familiar gesture that tells me he\u2019s thinking the question over. \u201cBad,\u201d he says finally. \u201cThose creatures swarm, as if from a hive mind. When the bombardment started, I thought the buildings would break wide open and the beasts would devour us. I am more than a little amazed to be alive.\u201d His stark, quiet tone makes it worse somehow.</p><p>A shudder runs through me. I don\u2019t ask anything more, not while I\u2019m eating. I\u2019m not sure I can hear more, not until I know whether we all made it. When I finish, I watch the others scrape their bowls clean with dry granules, but I don\u2019t have any. I hate being unprepared. Vel tips some into my bowl wordlessly, and I smile my thanks.</p><p>Gotta love his bounty-hunter travel pack. I should get one.</p><p>I feel a little better now, slightly stronger. \u201cI\u2019m going to look for the rest of the crew. They must be around here somewhere.\u201d</p><p>The alternative is unthinkable.</p><p>He regards me for a moment with an inscrutable expression. \u201cHave you applied for a place to sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. Do I need to talk to someone about that?\u201d</p><p>Leaning around me, he points to another line fifty meters away. \u201cLex is handling that.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t miss him. Lex is a mountain of a man with big, rough features; he also happens to be Keri\u2019s co-chieftain. If she ever gets over hating him, they\u2019ll wed to seal the deal. She doesn\u2019t seem likely to do that anytime soon with March on scene.</p><p>\u201cHave you already arranged for . . . accommodation?\u201d A kind euphemism for the shantytown we have going down here.</p><p>Vel pats his pack. \u201cI have everything I need.\u201d</p><p>Well, of course he does. \u201cYou want to come with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems pointless to waste energy moving about when that might make it more difficult for the others to find me.\u201d</p><p>That makes sense, but I don\u2019t know if I can sit and wait. Patience isn\u2019t one of my well-developed virtues. \u201cVel . . . is there room with you? If I ask Lex, I\u2019ll end up sharing space with the clansmen.\u201d</p><p>If what Doc said is true, the McCulloughs went full throttle because they were afraid I was intervening on the side of Gunnar-Dahlgren, bringing supplies or reinforcements. I don\u2019t want to guilt him, though, so I leave the crucial part unspoken: And they aren\u2019t too happy with me right now. Since it was just a personal visit, serving a dual purpose, and I didn\u2019t bring anything but trouble, it\u2019s safe to say Gunnar-Dahlgren wishes me to perdition. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But I needed to make sure Tarn told me the truth, and I wasn\u2019t abandoning my obligations to Keri. I had to make sure I wasn\u2019t forsaking people who helped me out of a jam. And on a personal level, I needed Doc to check me out. I just don\u2019t trust anyone else. If I\u2019d known stopping would prove so disastrous, you can bet I would\u2019ve gone another way.</p><p>But hindsight is twenty-twenty.</p><p>The silence grows awkward. I toy with the idea of reminding him he\u2019s supposed to watch my back, and he owes me for sticking by him on Emry, but I don\u2019t say another word. I figure he knows those things already.</p><p>No clue what thoughts run behind his eyes, but the silence starts to make me uncomfortable. Maybe he\u2019s not used to such . . . intimacy? I can\u2019t imagine that he is, given his race and what he does for a living. I\u2019ll say it\u2019s that, and nothing personal. Mary knows, enough people hate me as it is.</p> <p>\u201cYou can stay with me,\u201d he says finally. \u201cAre you still going to look around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I see\u201d\u2014he pauses\u2014\u201canyone, I\u2019ll tell them where to find you.\u201d</p><p>His hesitation tells me he\u2019s worried about March. That makes two of us.</p><p>I\u2019m none too eager for my own company, considering that everyone blames me for the increased furor of the McCullough attack. It feels like the Hate Jax backlash that followed the crash of the Sargasso\u2014only this time, it really is my fault. Nothing I did on purpose, but bad mojo follows me just the same.</p> <p>With a wave, I set off into the crowd. I have people to find, or I\u2019ll die trying.</p><p>CHAPTER 29</p><p>The place is bigger than it looks.</p><p>Concealed rooms branch off from the main bunker, offering an illusion of privacy. From the looks I receive, I\u2019m not welcome either. So I slide back out like a shadow, weaving between the tents.</p><p>I want to scream. My stomach has tied itself into knots, worrying about the man\u2014</p><p>Who steps out of a large tent, right behind Keri. He\u2019s blood-spattered, wounded, and filthy, but more or less whole. As March turns, the whole world slows, receding into the background.</p> <p>I see his lips move, mouthing my name, even as he pushes past the people between us. Not walking. Running. I\u2019m afraid to smile, but I meet him halfway. He wraps me so tight in his arms that it hurts, but I don\u2019t complain. Not when I can feel his heart beating against mine. He spins me in his arms as if I weigh nothing.</p><p>\u201cJax,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>With shaking fingers, I touch the pale bandage at his temple. It looks like he\u2019ll have another scar for the collection.In turn he brushes rough fingertips across my cheek. I\u2019m surprised to see them come away wet.</p><p>I have no words.</p><p>For now it doesn\u2019t matter how complicated things have become between us. It only matters that he\u2019s here.</p><p>His breath hitches. All around us, people enjoy their own tearful reunions, paying us no mind. The same can\u2019t be said for Keri, whose angry gaze bores into my back. She has another reason to hate me, among so many others.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re waiting for us in tactical,\u201d she tells him, gesturing at one of those semiprivate alcoves.</p><p>I can\u2019t imagine what strategy will get Gunnar-Dahlgren out of this mess, but the clans never give up. I admire that.</p> <p>To my surprise he doesn\u2019t let go. \u201cDo this one without me.\u201d</p><p>He gives her no opportunity to argue. I intended to look for Jael and Dina as well, but he swings me into his arms and carries me toward one of the larger tents. If I wasn\u2019t so damn happy to see him, I\u2019d probably struggle. As it is, I lay my head on his shoulder and close my eyes for a moment. He smells of smoke and unseen battles.</p><p>March ducks a little to get inside, sets me on my own two feet, and then seals the flap after us. It\u2019s dim within, a plain canvas shelter that underlines the gravity of our situation. I\u2019ve been in a lot of messes in my day\u2014at this point it\u2019s sort of my specialty\u2014but I do believe this one frosts them all.</p><p>\u201cYou made it.\u201d He sounds hoarse.</p><p>I imagine him shouting orders until his voice gave out, helping organize the retreat. March knows about killing. I have only a passing acquaintance with that side of him.</p><p>\u201cI have Doc to thank for that. I never would\u2019ve made it through those tunnels without him. I wanted to run out and look for you.\u201d With a long sigh, I drop onto the sleep mat he\u2019s unrolled.</p><p>He smiles. In the faint light, his face looks even rougher than usual, all harsh planes and angles. His eyes glitter like uncut amber, pure cognac gold. \u201cOf course you did. I\u2019m so fucking tired, Jax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo sleep.\u201d Okay, so that\u2019s not how I imagined this would go, but I don\u2019t want to fight with him anymore.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been alone with you in weeks,\u201d he says. \u201cDo you really think I\u2019m going to doze off? I can actually see your heart beating . . .\u201d As he collapses beside me, he touches the base of my throat. \u201cSometimes I forget\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I tilt my head back, registering a pleasurable shock.</p><p>How fragile you are. When he fills my mind in a hot rush, I realize how lonely I\u2019ve been. How much I\u2019ve missed him. I don\u2019t even take umbrage at being called fragile. Right now I am, physically, and there\u2019s no value in denying the obvious.</p><p>But that reminds me. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you . . . make contact? Let me know you were alive?\u201d</p><p>He pulls me back into his arms as if he\u2019s loath to lose hold of me even for a minute. \u201cSometimes I forget you don\u2019t know everything about me. If you think back, I\u2019ve never touched you across long distances.\u201d</p><p>Shit. He\u2019s right. Most of our contact occurs when we\u2019re on ship together or in the same room. Here I thought\u2014 well, never mind. Relief surges through me. March wasn\u2019t punishing me with the silence, which is good, because I don\u2019t know if I could\u2019ve forgiven him that.</p><p>\u201cDo you still love me?\u201d When the question comes gusting out, my face burns like I\u2019ve been splashed with acid.</p><p>March leans his head against mine. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the psychic. It\u2019s mean to toy with me.\u201d</p><p>He eases down until our noses touch, lips mere millimeters away from a kiss. \u201cI don\u2019t always agree with your decisions, and you drive me out of my mind sometimes. Like you pushing me away when I want so bad to be there for you. I\u2019m still trying to understand that. But yeah, I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand?\u201d I ask tiredly. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last few weeks, you\u2019ve been breaking my heart.\u201d Such a stark tone, unadorned truth.</p><p>I have no defense against that. Mary help me, I want him so bad.</p><p>And he knows.</p><p>I see it just before his mouth takes mine in a kiss that I feel like I\u2019ve waited for my whole life. Heat. Need. He cups my face in his hands.</p><p>At this moment I don\u2019t care about the people outside these fragile walls. The world shrinks to him and me. My fingertips brush the curve of his ear, and he shivers in reaction. I know all his hot spots now.</p><p>He laughs softly, trailing his lips down my throat. I suck in a shaky breath. Yeah, he knows mine, too.</p><p>\u201cThis is only a temporary truce,\u201d I whisper into his jaw.</p><p>He gives me a slow simmering smile. \u201cI can live with that.\u201d</p><p>March pulls my vest over my head, skimming my skin with his palms. For just a moment I feel scrawny and self-conscious, but it\u2019s nothing he hasn\u2019t seen before, scars and all. Plus he has more than his share, and I relearn them all as I tug his shirt over his head.</p><p>Even in the dim light, I can tell he\u2019s a mass of bruises. I don\u2019t even know how he can stand for me to touch him. I hesitate, my good hand hovering over his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure? I won\u2019t hurt you?\u201d</p><p>A soft laugh escapes him, as if he can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve asked. I know he\u2019s twice my size, but he\u2019s wounded, dammit. And I\u2019ve been known to bite.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both a little bit broken,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cBut we\u2019ll take care not to cut each other on the sharp edges.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>Quiet lightning surges between us, a longing that cannot be channeled or contained. He touches me with exquisite gentleness, lips trailing heat wherever he claims me with his hands. I arch against him, melting.</p><p>His penis feels so hard, it almost hurts where it jabs me. I undo his pants with unsteady hands. In this moment I need nothing more than March.</p><p>Primitive.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he gasps, though I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of my thoughts or my fingers curling around him. I love how I short-circuit his higher brain functions. \u201cYou, on top. I want to watch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLazy bastard,\u201d I manage to tease as I climb on.</p><p>His eyes drift shut as I sink down, sheathing him. He fills me, pure heat. I start slow and easy, but I can\u2019t control myself for long, not that he\u2019ll let me. March cradles my hips in his hands, moving me on him. Showing me how he wants it.</p><p>\u201cTake me, Jax.\u201d I can\u2019t resist his whispered plea.</p><p>Faster.</p><p>More.</p><p>I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s him or me, but we both crave it. Our breathing changes tempo, staccato urgency. Once we find a hungry rhythm, his hands roam my body as if he owns me. Or wants to.</p><p>When his fingers drift down my belly, stroking lower still, I bear down and let the orgasm come. Liquid lust wracks me in hard, frantic waves.</p><p>March offers a wicked smile, holding me upright. \u201cDon\u2019t pass out, baby. I\u2019m just getting started. Lost time and all that.\u201d</p><p>I manage to snort, though I feel shaky as hell. \u201cYou wish. I\u2019m still woman enough to wear you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your best shot.\u201d</p><p>His eyes shine as he settles back, preparing to make me work for it. I roll my hips on him as aftershocks spark through me. But he\u2019s not ready for what I do next.</p><p>Lean down, nip his throat. Grind. I suck, tugging his skin with my teeth. That\u2019s going to leave a mark.</p><p>He shudders, breath rushing in noisy gusts.</p><p>I whisper, \u201cEvery time I\u2019ve touched myself in the last four months, I thought of you. Every. Time.\u201d</p><p>And then he\u2019s all mine, groaning, shaking, and breathless beneath me.</p><p>CHAPTER 30</p><p>When l come to, he\u2019s dressed and about to slip out on me.</p><p>That\u2019s probably fitting, given the way I ran out on March the first time we had sex. The universe has a way of rewarding people with what they deserve. I\u2019m not sure what this says about me.</p><p>No, I do, actually. It says things I don\u2019t enjoy hearing.</p><p>I push up onto my elbow. \u201cYou weren\u2019t going to wake me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to bother you.\u201d That sounds like an excuse.</p><p>\u201cI need you more than sleep.\u201d The words feel barbed coming out of my mouth. There, I said it, damn him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need me,\u201d he says with quiet finality. \u201cYou want me. You might even love me. But you don\u2019t need me. I wish you did.\u201d</p><p>Is this because I wouldn\u2019t lean on him? Didn\u2019t want to become physically dependent?</p><p>He goes on, \u201cThey need me in planning sessions. Though we\u2019ve retreated, we can\u2019t just hunker down here. We need to talk strategy and coordinate the war effort. The McCulloughs won\u2019t settle for anything less than a full hostile takeover, so we have to exterminate them.\u201d He sounds so cold. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A chill courses through me. March tries so hard to suppress this side of his personality, the darkness where he lost his soul once before. In the shadows his face looks almost inhuman, taut and graven. I\u2019ve never seen him wear an expression quite like this, as if he\u2019s switched his feelings off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let me keep you.\u201d I want to get dressed, but I won\u2019t crawl out from under the blanket. His eyes sear like lasers.</p><p>He hesitates, as if there\u2019s something more he wants to say. And then: \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re safe, Jax.\u201d</p><p>I just nod. Not exactly an impassioned declaration, but this isn\u2019t the moment for them either. As soon as he leaves, I scramble for my clothes, still scattered where we threw them earlier. I\u2019m not sure how long I\u2019ve been out.</p> <p>Noise levels outside indicate some of the clan has retired for a few hours at least. I dress quickly and push my way out of the tent. They\u2019ve left guards posted, which makes sense, in case Doc is wrong, and the McCulloughs do find us. The diminished crowds mean I can make my way around easier.</p><p>In the hours I slept, they\u2019ve done more work on the encampment. Makeshift barricades now sit before the two exits to the tunnels, along with motion detectors. Well, at least nobody\u2019s sneaking up our backsides.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do next. Clearly I\u2019m not welcome in the strategy meetings, not that I would have anything of value to offer. Of the clansmen still awake, most seem to know who I am, based on their glaring. I move away from March\u2019s tent, feeling rather aimless.</p><p>I\u2019m a fucking jumper, for Mary\u2019s sake. I don\u2019t belong down here. This isn\u2019t even my fight. I had nothing to do with the McCulloughs deciding my visit portended Conglomerate interference in local politics. I sigh.</p><p>Maybe my basic medical training would make me somewhat useful to Doc, so I head that way. I swing around a crate of disorganized supplies and spot my favorite guardian. To be honest, I register a tiny flicker of relief.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking everywhere for you,\u201d Jael says, vaulting over the parts. \u201cTarn\u2019s going to fire me if I don\u2019t get you out of here.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but arch my brows. \u201cThat\u2019s your concern? Take a look around, genius. We\u2019re in danger of being killed by clansmen, one way or another. If Gunnar-Dahlgren doesn\u2019t do it, the McCulloughs will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on my watch.\u201d</p><p>A snicker escapes me. \u201cYou\u2019re the worst bodyguard ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, I admit I may not have been as vigilant as I ought. But I had no idea this was a high-risk environment. I didn\u2019t do enough research on this fucked-up, Mary-forsaken hellhole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not enjoying our goodwill tour then?\u201d It ought to be against the law to derive so much amusement from one person.</p> <p>\u201cPuzzled that out for yourself, did you?\u201d</p><p>I realize I haven\u2019t asked about the important stuff, so I leave off messing with him. \u201cIs Dina all right? What about the ship?\u201d</p><p>He sucks in a sharp breath, as if being reminded hurts him, and shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know whether she\u2019ll make it.\u201d</p><p>My stomach lurches. \u201cDina? Or the ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ship\u2019s a dead loss,\u201d he answers. \u201cI carried our girl in, but she bled out a lot before I tied the wound off. She\u2019s lost a leg, for sure, and I don\u2019t know if they can replace it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ass!\u201d I can\u2019t believe he stood there talking about getting me off planet when Dina might be dying.</p><p>I try to push past him, but he snags my shoulders. \u201cHey, where you going? She\u2019s sedated, Jax. You mean to go wake her up with your wailing, inhibit the healing process, and annoy the doc?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just need to see her, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p> <p>His icy gaze searches mine for a moment before he gives a short nod. \u201cRight. I\u2019m not letting you out of my sight again, so I\u2019ll come along.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. It doesn\u2019t matter if I have a shadow. We weave through the narrow passages leading back to medical. I don\u2019t see Doc anywhere, but his friend Rose greets me with a cool glance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re checking on your ship\u2019s mechanic?\u201d</p><p>My teeth clench. Maybe the vids still show me as a spoiled little nav-star, but I don\u2019t use people like that anymore, thinking only of what they can do for me. Dina\u2019s my friend. But before I can start a fight\u2014and I\u2019m tempted\u2014 Jael says smoothly, \u201cYeah. Any change?\u201d</p><p>Like I\u2019m not even there, she gestures for him to follow her toward the back. As I slink along in their wake, I decide I must be the worst ambassador in the history of diplomacy. Well, except for Karl Fitzwilliam, who started the Axis Wars.</p><p>Now there\u2019s a comforting thought.</p><p>The number of wounded has diminished since I dropped Doc here. I hope they recovered, not died, but I don\u2019t put much faith in the reality of that outcome. It\u2019s going to take a miracle to save us, and maybe the ones who have already gone through that final door are the lucky ones. I\u2019d take a fast death over one that lingers.</p><p>She\u2019s so pale.</p><p>At first she doesn\u2019t even seem to be breathing. Her fair hair has been brushed back from her brow, and for the first time, I notice she has a heart-shaped face. Her gruff manner disguises the fact somewhat, but in repose, Dina is quite pretty. No wonder Jael can\u2019t resist flirting with her, even though he knows it\u2019s a lost cause.</p><p>\u201cDid you manage to find a prosthetic?\u201d</p><p>On some level, I acknowledge it makes sense for him to make the inquiries because he\u2019s the one who saved her life. He\u2019s the one who carried her to safety. A hot, angry sensationboils in my stomach because I wasn\u2019t there for someone I care about, as if I could\u2019ve changed things somehow.</p><p>It\u2019s not logical. I didn\u2019t let Vel down on Emry, and I know I can\u2019t be everywhere at once, but damn March anyway. He\u2019s infected me with his devastating sense of moral responsibility.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s far from ideal,\u201d Rose says softly. \u201cBut we managed to salvage a limb from . . . elsewhere. So far, no signs of rejection, but we weren\u2019t able to do extensive tissue testing. We had to graft or cauterize the nerves. Doc made the call.\u201d</p><p>Elsewhere.</p><p>How do you gaze into a pile of dead bodies and decide what leg to harvest? My breath gusts out in a shaky sound, drawing their attention. \u201cIs she stable?\u201d</p><p>Rose doesn\u2019t meet my gaze. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, Ambassador. We\u2019ve only been able to save one person, after such a mauling. I\u2019m astonished your friend has lasted this long, between shock, blood loss, and myriad other factors. If you put any stock in any gods at all, now is the time to address yourself to them.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stay out of the way and let me do my job,\u201d she answers.</p><p>That\u2019s clearly a dismissal, so I turn, sensing Jael fall in step. I know what it was like out there for him amid the rush of wings, carnage at every turn. Yet he came through it, and though he doesn\u2019t seem inclined to view himself that way, he\u2019s a hero, too. Damn, why am I surrounded by them on all sides?</p><p>\u201cYou risked your life to save her,\u201d I say in neutral tones. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He gives me a faint smile. \u201cThe fact that you\u2019d even ask proves you don\u2019t know anything about me.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 31</p><p>lf you\u2019ve never tried living underground, l don\u2019t recommend it.</p><p>While soldiers conduct a guerilla war in the tunnels, picking off the McCullough scout teams, the rest of us work to build a life in this primitive pit. The raw violence stuns me. I hear distant fighting, day and night, and the screams of dying men. I don\u2019t know what they do with the corpses, can\u2019t even imagine.</p><p>For the first few days, I perform manual labor alongside the clansmen. We make weapons, chemical stoves, and other necessities. At night I bed down with Vel, who handles my presence with inscrutable aplomb.</p><p>I don\u2019t know whether Tarn knows anything about the mess on Lachion, but even if he does, I can\u2019t expect rescue from that angle. This is a fair-sized planet, and locating us where we\u2019ve gone to ground would be worse than trying to find a needle in a haystack. We\u2019ll need to save ourselves, business as usual.</p><p>March stays busy with tactical meetings and leads the strike teams himself. This merc, this killer, I hardly know him. Each time he leaves the bunker, I feel sure he\u2019s not coming back. I hate how he strides into danger, leaving me behind, but Jael would bodily restrain me if I tried to join the fight.</p><p>On the third day, a mission goes bad. I don\u2019t know whether we got faulty intel, or what happened out there, but we\u2019re drowning in wounded. Lex passes me at a run, barking out, \u201cDoc needs you!\u201d as he goes to work on damage control.</p><p>If the McCulloughs find this bunker, we\u2019re done.</p><p>A chill ripples over me. Surely Doc didn\u2019t go out with the grunts himself. That would be madness. But my heart pounds double time as I head for the big gray tent functioning as the clan hospital.</p><p>As I push through the parted flaps, I break out into a cold sweat. There are at least twenty bodies in varying stages of dismemberment, and the air feels thick and heavy in my nostrils, sweet with clotting blood. Doc looks up from his work briefly and then goes back to whatever he\u2019s doing inside that poor kid.</p><p>I say kid because the person Doc\u2019s working on can\u2019t be much older than Keri, but he\u2019s old enough to fight for his clan. Old enough to die, if the operation doesn\u2019t go well. I haven\u2019t seen March yet today; he could be somewhere among all these bodies. I shudder and try to force that thought away. If he were dead, surely I\u2019d know. I\u2019d feel something. But our connection has thinned, and he doesn\u2019t seek me out anymore.</p><p>Rose turns then, jerking her head toward the back of the tent. \u201cChange into some scrubs. There\u2019s a sealed set in the cupboard. Then stand inside the san-shower on sterile setting for at least sixty seconds.\u201d</p><p>Maybe the dry heat will do something to calm my nerves. I have a feeling that whatever they intend to ask me to do, I\u2019m not going to like it, particularly if it requires me to dress like a doctor and scrub up like one, too. But I don\u2019t protest.</p><p>It takes me less than two minutes to get geared up. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>Doc answers without pausing what he\u2019s doing. \u201cThere\u2019s a device on the table next to Rose. It\u2019s dead simple, just point and shoot. I need you to use it to take readings on all our wounded. It will help us calculate triage.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not trained for this. I want to argue, but I don\u2019t. If it will help, then I can\u2019t say no. I don\u2019t even bother asking \u201cwhy me?\u201d Approaching the wounded men lined up on drab olive blankets, I feel my hands trembling.</p><p>Like Doc said, though, it\u2019s really basic. From a single point of contact, the gizmo registers temperature, heart rate, and scads of other medical data. All I have to do is enter the patient\u2019s number, as present on his clan ID. I feel like I\u2019m tagging corpses, even though some of them move or moan or beg me to make the pain stop.</p><p>The third soldier is wide-awake and, Mary help him, coherent. With a wound like the one in his side, I don\u2019t know how. He grabs my wrist, fingers grinding against bone. \u201cDid Jerro make it? Where is he? I promised his ma I\u2019d take care of him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d Doc says. \u201cJust try to relax. You\u2019re up next.\u201d</p><p>Whether that\u2019s the truth or a platitude, the guy relaxes his grip on me and fades out. I hope he isn\u2019t dead. The gadget reassures me he\u2019s stable for the time being, and I move on to the next patient.</p><p>Soon, we get into a groove. I see why they needed me now, or at least another pair of hands. I choose the next patient, based on need, Doc does patch work, and then Rose finishes up, sealing wounds and incisions. There\u2019s also a clansman doing transport, moving patients from the hospital into the recovery area.</p><p>By the time we finish, I\u2019m aching from head to toe. People who say being on the med team is easy ought to be shot. Of course that would just make more work for us, so maybe I could let \u2019em go with a warning.</p> <p>Before I head back to the tent I share with Vel, I ask, \u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not clan,\u201d Doc says quietly. \u201cDo you really think I could ask someone who knew these men to help decide who lives and dies?\u201d</p><p>I never thought of that. But yeah, the little gadget had determined two of the soldiers wouldn\u2019t make it, regardless of treatment, so they got bumped to the bottom of the list. Rose shot them full of painkiller, and they died quietly, which was all we could do for them. I try to imagine someone who knew them, who had lived, worked, fought, and possibly loved those men, being asked to watch them die. My heart seizes up into a Gordian knot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I could help.\u201d My voice sounds rusty. \u201cBut I\u2019m busted. I\u2019ll be back in the morning if you need me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you could.\u201d He looks so damn tired, too, but he\u2019s not leaving.</p> <p>We find heroes, not on battlefields, but in hospitals that tend the injured. Sometimes I think it\u2019s easier to fight than it is to heal. I check the recovery area one last time, making sure nobody needs anything.</p><p>Dina has finally come around. Thanks to her rugged constitution, they\u2019ve developed an antivenom for those who survive Teras attacks. She can\u2019t walk yet, but they\u2019re hopeful. She doesn\u2019t want me around, though. Dina isn\u2019t unfair enough to lay all this on me, but she\u2019s a bitchy patient, and I seem to rub her the wrong way, no matter my intentions.</p><p>I spend the fourth day working in recovery, changing bandages, fetching this or that, and generally entertaining crotchety soldiers who are convinced the war will be lost if they don\u2019t get off their cots. March avoids me, and my heart breaks by millimeters. I should confront him. I will. When I work up the nerve.</p><p>And on the fifth day, Doc takes me aside.</p><p>\u201cThings have slowed a bit, so I\u2019ve had a chance to take a look at your test results, some of the data I couldn\u2019t interpret before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p> <p>The bustle of clansmen going about their business muffles our words somewhat. In the distance I hear the discharge of weapons, echoing oddly through the tunnels. I\u2019ve never been surrounded by war, not like this. It\u2019s a precarious feeling, and I\u2019m itchy with the need to get the hell out of here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got good news and bad news, Jax.\u201d</p><p>I brace myself. \u201cBad first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to live, you have to stop jumping.\u201d</p><p>Of all the things he could\u2019ve said, this shocks me the most. We all know jumping will kill us someday; it\u2019s sort of a given. \u201cYeah, I get that.\u201d</p><p>Doc shakes his head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you do. You know how you\u2019re receiving daily injections to combat that inexplicable bone condition?\u201d I nod. He\u2019s already told me that such diseases are rare in young people. \u201cLet me try to put this in laymen\u2019s terms. A normal human brain suffers irrevocable damage after repeated exposures to the stress of grimspace. You\u2019re no exception to this. But you differ from other navigators in a DNA . . . mutation that permits you to cannibalize other physical resources to heal the damage you take.\u201d</p><p>It takes me a few moments to process that. \u201cWhen I pass out for three days after a bad jump\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the unique metabolic process at work. But in order to heal, the resources must be taken from elsewhere,\u201d he says with a grave look.</p> <p>\u201cSo my body breaks down my bones to fix my brain, so I can keep jumping. And there\u2019s no cure?\u201d I can\u2019t look at him. My gaze roves the crowd behind him, watching a man assemble shocksticks and taser pistols from spare parts.</p><p>\u201cHow could there be? I\u2019ve never heard of a jumper who could do this, and I\u2019ve studied thousands of medical records.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t need to spell it out for me. The next time I lapse into a near coma, there\u2019s no telling what system might be ransacked in order to regenerate my brain. Vascular or respiratory pillage might kill me on the spot.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way to regulate it?\u201d</p><p>Doc shrugs. \u201cPerhaps. This is uncharted territory, Jax. I might eventually be able to develop an implant to control what systems are tapped, defaulting to the less vital ones.\u201d</p><p>The rest goes unspoken. That would require time and facilities, and right now, my welfare simply isn\u2019t at the top of his list. He has a whole clan to care for, new wounded coming in daily, and a war raging around us. In the meantime I shouldn\u2019t jump, or it will just get worse. I\u2019ll die, just not like most jumpers.</p><p>So how the hell are we getting off this rock? I exhale shakily.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the good news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver time, we can repair the degeneration to your skeletal system,\u201d he tells me. \u201cMaintain the treatments as prescribed, and you won\u2019t always be so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreakable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not a word I\u2019d apply to you.\u201d He smiles faintly.</p><p>Well, he can\u2019t see inside me. The man I love risks his life on an hourly basis, and he drifts further away with every heartbeat. Though I can\u2019t articulate the impression, I\u2019m losing him. Kill by kill, someone else trickles in to eclipse the light where he used to be.</p><p>He needs to walk away from this war. But March cannot excise his sense of obligation to Keri, springing from his inability to repay Mair, Keri\u2019s grandmother, for everything she did for him. I remember his words, back on the water-logged world of Marakeq. I\u2019d asked him why he was always in my head.</p><p>\u201cIt means our theta waves are compatible,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost always a one-way feed. I get impressions from other people, what kind and how deep depends on how disciplined their minds are and how much I want to know. Used to be uncontrollable, couldn\u2019t shut it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMair. She wouldn\u2019t teach me the higher forms, but she saw what a mess I was and taught me how to quiet my mind. Shut out the noise through meditation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore she took me in hand, I wasn\u2019t even human, Jax. You have no idea how many people I\u2019ve ended. Broke minds to set an example, for the hell of it, or just because I needed a quiet kill. I spent years on Nicuan, feeding their endless wars. By the time I stole a ship because they shorted my pay, there was nothing left. Mair rebuilt me, brick by brick.\u201d</p><p>Oh, irony, you\u2019re such a bitch.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I tell Doc then. I think he reads something in my expression, but he doesn\u2019t ask, thank Mary. \u201cI\u2019ll let you get back to work. I know you\u2019ve got people a lot sicker than me to deal with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve prepared sixty days\u2019 worth of your treatment, Jax. Just inject yourself once a day, and you should start to see some improvement.\u201d</p><p>As long as I don\u2019t jump. Fuck that, it would be kinder to kill me outright. I make myself smile and thank him. Turning, I lose myself in bodies going about their business. The clansmen are tough, stolid as rocks, and they seem to have adapted well to this lifestyle.</p><p>Sometime later, Jael finds me as I sit mechanically assembling weapons I\u2019ll never use. This isn\u2019t my fight; I\u2019m just caught in the middle of it. But if I ever need to, I can get work on low-tech worlds where they make use of cheap human labor.</p><p>Part of me acknowledges that\u2019s an exaggeration. I still have my post as ambassador, unless Tarn has washed his hands of me. I wouldn\u2019t know at this point. They can always hire another jumper to ferry me from place to place, but that option rouses a sick, miserable feeling in the pit of my stomach.</p><p>\u201cYou look like your best friend died,\u201d he says, dropping down beside me.</p><p>Given our current situation, that seems particularly tactless. I just shrug. I don\u2019t feel like talking, particularly not to him. I can\u2019t let myself bond with someone who reminds me so much of Kai.</p><p>He misinterprets my gloom. \u201cLook, they seem to think Dina\u2019s going to make it. Cheer up, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it mandatory?\u201d I\u2019m not ready to share my prognosis with anyone. It\u2019s bad enough that I have to haul a med kit around and shoot up like a chem-head.</p><p>\u201cNope. But this might help. We\u2019re getting out of here. Two days, tops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Bug friend has some astonishing resources in that bag of his. We\u2019ve been monitoring enemy transmissions, and they\u2019re discussing a fallback, as the tunnel war isn\u2019t going well. When they retreat, we\u2019ll sneak out and head for the surface.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd be left wide open for Teras to pick off? Or any McCullough men that happen to be in the vicinity?\u201d That might be the worst idea I\u2019ve ever heard.</p><p>Jael sighs. \u201cGive us a little credit, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have much faith left, I\u2019m afraid. This scheme sounds stupid, dangerous, and highly likely to get me killed, full of adrenaline-inducing moments, and the hot rush of risk. Which means I should be all for it. Haven\u2019t I always said I didn\u2019t become a jumper to die old and gray? I stop protesting.</p><p>\u201cIt means we have a plan. I will get you out of here, Jax. You have my word.\u201d</p><p>I manage a smile, but I don\u2019t believe much in promises anymore either. \u201cWhat about Dina? She\u2019s not going to be ready to run in two days.\u201d</p><p>If he suggests leaving her, I\u2019ll punch him in the eye. I am not the woman from the vids. People are not disposable to me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to pose a bit of a problem,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we\u2019ll figure that out, too. I need to get back to Vel. Did you want to be in on the brainstorming?\u201d</p><p>My brittle smile softens into something close to real. \u201cYeah. I would.\u201d</p><p>He tugs me to my feet. \u201cWell, let\u2019s do it. Forget this,\u201d he adds, sweeping an arm to indicate the dim, grungy encampment. \u201cSoon it\u2019ll seem like a bad dream.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, I have plenty of those.</p><p>CHAPTER 32</p><p>We\u2019ve made our plans.</p><p>In four hours, we\u2019re out of here. Vel and Jael have fashioned a back harness, and they\u2019ll take turns carrying Dina. Now we just need to say good-bye to Doc, quietly, and collect March, not necessarily in that order. It goes without saying that I\u2019m in charge of the latter.</p><p>He\u2019s probably in some meeting, so I leave the other two and go looking for him. Chemical stoves emit a burnt polymer smell as I weave my way through the tents. This nomadic encampment has taken on certain clan characteristics by this point. They\u2019ve allocated a training circle where the rehabilitating men spar to keep from killing each other, and the women occupy themselves across the way devising new uses for old rubbish. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In the distance I hear sounds of combat, cries of pain and rage. Overhead the bombardment has stopped at last, making me think we may have a chance. If Vel\u2019s intel is correct, and we time our run to a McCullough retreat, we might get off this rock.</p><p>I settle outside the tactical tent and wait. Passing clansmenno longer glare at me, at least. Someone taps me on the shoulder. I glance up and find someone who looks more like a raider queen than a Lachion native.</p><p>She\u2019s incredibly tall, dusky-skinned, and she wears her hair in a short pouf. Her bare arms reveal whipcord strength. Slim metal rods pierce her nose, lower lip, and left brow. She glimmers with silver at throat, fingers, and wrists, highlighting her exotic allure. In the diffuse light, her eyes gleam tawny gold, like a predatory cat.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d I don\u2019t recognize her, but that doesn\u2019t mean much. I haven\u2019t met everyone down here.</p> <p>She folds herself into the lotus position beside me. \u201cWhispers say you\u2019re making a break. I want to hitch a ride.\u201d</p><p>I recognize her accent, match it to a small world in the Outskirts. If I recall correctly, a bunch of artists and poets settled the place. I wonder if she can fight.</p><p>\u201cMay not be a smooth run. We could die out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could die down here. I know which I prefer.\u201d</p><p>The woman has a point. I offer my hand. \u201cI\u2019m Jax.\u201d</p> <p>A faint smile creases her mouth. \u201cI know who you are.\u201d</p><p>But she takes my hand, firm grip. Calluses. Okay, so maybe not a useless arty type after all. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Suraya, but my friends call me Hit.\u201d</p><p>I have a feeling I\u2019m going to regret asking. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Her smile widens. \u201cBecause I only ever need one to take someone down.\u201d</p><p>Oh, that type.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing on Lachion?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cBad idea, this supply run. My whole crew died in the attack. I can pilot, so I won\u2019t be deadweight.\u201d Hit shows me the shunt in her wrist as if I might doubt her word.</p><p>Well, it\u2019s never a bad idea to have a backup pilot on board. \u201cI\u2019ll need to talk it over with the others. I\u2019m going to assume they don\u2019t object, so meet us at the south exit in three and a half hours.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes gleam. \u201cDone. I won\u2019t forget this, Ambassador.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m still not used to being addressed like that. \u201cDon\u2019t thank me yet. We have klicks of enemy territory to cover, and then we still have to find a way off this rock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the kind of person who makes things happen,\u201d she says.</p><p>Am I?</p><p>Just now I feel like I\u2019m the world champion at waiting. Hit climbs to her feet and sets off, presumably to collect her gear. I sit and brood.</p> <p>An hour later, March comes out of the tent, no surprises there. His expression doesn\u2019t warm when he notices me. In fact, he looks mildly annoyed, but that might be projection more than accurate interpretation on my part.</p><p>\u201cJax.\u201d He bends to greet me with a light kiss on the mouth. \u201cYou caught me just before I take another team out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget that, let someone else do it. Say your good-byes and pack your stuff. We\u2019re getting the hell out of here. Meet us at the south exit in two and a half hours.\u201d I clamber to my feet and jerk my head toward the tunnel for emphasis.</p><p>His eyes go very dark and still. March studies me for a moment in silence, and then the saddest smile curves his lips. He takes my hands in his and seals a kiss into each palm. I can\u2019t feel him at all; he hasn\u2019t touched my mind in days, and the physical contact seems sharper in contrast.</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d he says quietly.</p><p>Two words. How can two words make me feel like this?</p><p>For a moment, I can\u2019t breathe for the bands tightening around my chest. My eyes sting. I tug my hands away from him and curl them into fists. Against my best efforts to wear a poker face, I feel the tears slipping down my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d I try to say, but my voice comes out strange and strangled.</p><p>People passing by give us odd looks, and March tries to take my arm, draw me to a quieter place to talk. Fuck that. I jerk away and glare at him through blurry eyes, jaw clenched.</p><p>Say it here, damn you. Right now.</p><p>He offers an almost imperceptible nod. \u201cI\u2019m staying. I owe it to Mair\u2019s memory, and the clan, after all they\u2019ve done for me. They took me in, after I walked away from the merc life. And Mair asked me to look after Keri, when she was just ten years old. You don\u2019t need me, Jax. Keri does. This is my war\u2014I have the training, the experience, and I\u2019ll make the difference between their survival and annihilation here. I have to see this through. But you don\u2019t need my help getting to Ithiss-Tor; another pilot can get you there.\u201d</p><p>So he\u2019s cutting me loose. I raise my chin and wipe my face with the backs of my hands. In my heart, I know I\u2019ve already lost him.</p><p>He\u2019s going to die down here, and it\u2019s killing me. I feel a scream building in my lungs, raw and angry. I don\u2019t want him to become a martyr. I want him beside me.</p><p>No surprise when he reads me. I\u2019m an open book where he\u2019s concerned. His expression softens, and March pulls me into his arms. At first I resist on principle because the bastard is leaving me\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI\u2019m not. You\u2019ll see me again, I swear. This isn\u2019t forever.\u201d</p><p>Tears course down my cheeks. I squeeze them shut, but it doesn\u2019t help. They don\u2019t stop falling.</p><p>Because I don\u2019t believe him. I know a good-bye when I feel one.</p><p>His mouth finds mine, blind and hungry. March hasn\u2019t kissed me in days, but suddenly it\u2019s like the only thing he knows how to do. Lips clinging, he tastes salty and bittersweet from my weeping. Again and again, until we gasp for air and lean our foreheads together.</p><p>Grief roars inside me. His breath stirs against my damp cheeks, and I try to memorize everything about this moment. How he feels against me, his scent, and the weight of his arms curled around my back.</p><p>I never thought he\u2019d leave me. Whatever he thinks, I do need him. Just not in the way he wants. I can\u2019t be someone other than I am; I can\u2019t love him except the way I know how.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he whispers, setting his cheek against my downy hair. \u201cIt\u2019s enough. It is. But I have to pay my debts. If I take everything Mair gave me and walk away from her kin when they\u2019re in need, then I\u2019ve forsaken what little honor she taught me. Can\u2019t you understand that? I can\u2019t be that guy again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get it. But it\u2019s killing you,\u201d I choke out. \u201cA centimeter at a time. So even if by some miracle you survive, you won\u2019t be March, not this March. You\u2019ll be\u2014\u201d I break off, tipping my head back to search his gaze with mine.</p><p>But I don\u2019t have the words for the darkness I sense coming for him. What good is honor when compassion is lost? And he knows. I see it in the gravity of his expression.</p><p>But he pretends he doesn\u2019t, another stone in the wall between us. \u201cI\u2019ll come back to you,\u201d he promises again.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I manage a smile. Soon the pain will crystallize into a diamond in my chest, allowing me to function. \u201cHave you thought about paint?\u201d When he looks puzzled, I add, \u201cTo combat the Teras? As things stand, it\u2019s all but impossible to fight them without heat-sensitive equipment that you don\u2019t have on world. But you could jury-rig a weapon that sprays them, making them easier to target.\u201d</p><p>The clans left the Teras alone because the danger meant nobody else wanted to settle here. And then the McCulloughs figured out how to harness them, catching the others flat-footed. Maybe March can benefit from this idea.</p><p>Mary, I feel raw.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll mention it in strat meetings,\u201d he says. \u201cIt might make the difference when we start trying to retake surface holdings. Please, Jax, don\u2019t look like that.\u201d</p><p>Like what? Like my heart is breaking?</p><p>He delves into his pocket and produces a ring that shines, cheap and tawdry even in this light. The red stones shimmer like glass. Without ceremony he shoves it onto my middle finger, where it hangs loose.</p><p>\u201cSvet collected trinkets like this. I bought it for her on Gehenna,\u201d he says softly. \u201cLast gift I ever got her, and I didn\u2019t have a chance to give it to her. It\u2019s never left my possession since I heard\u2014\u201d March rubs a thumb over my cheek. \u201cAnyway. I want you to have it . . . for now. I\u2019ll repo it someday, Jax. Get you something nicer. That\u2019s a promise.\u201d</p><p>I close my fingers to keep the ring from sliding off. \u201cI\u2019ll hold you to that.\u201d</p><p>He kisses me one last time, and I pretend I believe him, at least until he disappears from sight.</p><p>Deep down I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll never see him again, and it feels like my heart is dying.</p><p>CHAPTER 33</p><p>l\u2019ve said my farewells.</p><p>Doc said to check back with him regarding an implant, but I won\u2019t do that in person. I\u2019ll continue my injections and bounce a message to him when they\u2019ve restored communications. When things have settled down, I\u2019ll see what he can do for me. But that will take time.</p><p>We\u2019re done here. I\u2019m the first to arrive at the south exit. I doubt anyone else is as eager to get some distance from this place. Each moment I stand here constitutes a bitter reminder that March chose to stay.</p><p>Here with Keri.</p><p>It stings like hell that he put it that way: You don\u2019t need me. Keri does. Though I don\u2019t want to be jealous, the feeling burns in my veins like an acid cocktail. She\u2019s young; she doesn\u2019t have all the fucked-up dysfunctions I\u2019ve collected over the years.</p><p>But I can\u2019t dwell on petty, baseless jealousy. I have a job to do. As I straighten my shoulders, Jael turns up, with Dina reclining on an air sled like a queen. I smile at that.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the harness?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cDoc said he could spare this. It wasn\u2019t even working when I started messing with it. And she isn\u2019t bleeding, so it should be safer all around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, like I\u2019m not even here?\u201d Dina mock-glares at me and then reinforces the scowl by whirring over and giving me a whack.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re mobile,\u201d I say. \u201cI was worried about you.\u201d</p><p>She snorts. \u201cSave the mushy stuff for when we get off this Mary-forsaken rock. Is March almost ready?\u201d</p><p>Vel arrives, saving me the trouble of answering. I wonder how they\u2019re going to react to the news. A lance of fresh pain stabs through me, but I tamp it down. He made his choice.</p><p>\u201cI have confirmed the retreat,\u201d he says in lieu of a greeting. \u201cWe will not have a cleaner shot at this for months most likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll probably still see some fighting,\u201d Jael adds. \u201cBut I think Vel and I are a match for whatever we find down here.\u201d</p><p>The bounty hunter nods. \u201cI predict we\u2019ll find the enemy wounded and disorganized, separated from the rest of the clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do my part,\u201d Dina adds. \u201cI\u2019m not helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever said you were, darling.\u201d Jael ruffles her hair. \u201cI expect you to cover us. You\u2019re getting the only disruptor, after all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We talk a little longer, discussing our game plan. Hit rolls up with a bag strapped to her back, looking elegant and dangerous. \u201cWe ready?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cLucky break. I found us a new pilot.\u201d I don\u2019t pose it as a question.</p><p>We need her, so it\u2019s not open to discussion.</p><p>Everyone turns to gape at me, but Dina recovers first. \u201cWhat about March?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s staying,\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cGive me five minutes with him. Don\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d The mechanic\u2019s mouth firms into an angry white line. With that she whips away.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019ll convince him where I couldn\u2019t. Either way, Jael doesn\u2019t seem concerned. Not surprising, he doesn\u2019t know March well. But I do notice him inspecting Hit\u2019s wrist without any particular subtlety.</p><p>\u201cYou can take us up?\u201d the merc asks her. \u201cWhat rigs have you flown?\u201d</p><p>She gives him a toothy smile. \u201cYou let me worry about that, pretty boy. Find me a ship, and I\u2019ll fly the shit out of it.\u201d</p> <p>While they lapse into quiet banter, Vel surprises me with a soft touch on the shoulder. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>I register his sympathy with a certain amount of irony. The least human among us offers me the most emotional support, it seems. I move my shoulders in an unconvincing shrug.</p><p>\u201cI will be.\u201d</p><p>Someday.</p><p>Even if I can\u2019t imagine that day right now, with the loss so fresh, it\u2019ll come. Pain always fades. If I learned nothing else from life, I\u2019ve certainly mastered that.</p><p>More than five minutes pass while we wait for Dina. When she returns, her blue eyes look grim, and she won\u2019t meet my gaze.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she says tersely. \u201cWe\u2019ve wasted enough time here.\u201d</p><p>Taking that as his cue, Vel tinkers with the motion sensors set at the south tunnel. \u201cThis will disable them long enough for us to get past without raising an alarm. They\u2019ll come back online in sixty seconds, so we need to be quick.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cNoted. Let\u2019s get Dina through first.\u201d</p><p>She bitches, \u201cWhat am I, bait?\u201d</p><p>But I notice she doesn\u2019t hesitate to whip around the barricade and out into the tunnel beyond, faster than me, and I\u2019m hot on her heels. The rest join us in record time. Behind us, I hear the beep that means their motion sensor has come back online, preventing the McCulloughs from sneaking up their backsides. Mentally, I wish them luck with it, but we have our own battle to fight now.</p><p>Mary, I hope we\u2019re not running in the dark. Vel may have senses that can compensate, but the rest of us are only human. I don\u2019t think this group will be as sympathetic to my irrational fear either. They\u2019re not like Doc. They won\u2019t be patient and understanding about it.</p><p>To my vast relief, Jael cracks a torch-tube, and the sickly yellow-green light sizzles into existence, dispelling the hungry shadows to a greater distance. They\u2019re not gone entirely, but I can breathe now despite the heavy stone that entombs us.</p><p>My palms feel sweaty, but I\u2019ll deal. We don\u2019t have any Psi with us to reveal how much bravado factors into my fa\u00e7ade. I tell myself that\u2019s a good thing as I fall in behind Vel.</p> <p>The merc leads the way, weapons in hand. Jael wields a shockstick in one, a sonicblade in the other, and looks as though he\u2019ll be lethal in a fight. I\u2019m overly conscious of our breathing, the scrape of our boots against the rock floor.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how far we\u2019ve come. I just watch Vel\u2019s back and put one foot in front of the other. The bounty hunter monitors our twists and turns. If anyone can get us out of this, he can. He\u2019s my miracle man.</p><p>Despite Doc\u2019s assurances, I fear that the Teras might have found a way in. Who knows how they burrow? If they turn their claws to it, I bet they could tear through the cave walls and into the warren leading to the bunker.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s what drives the McCullough retreat. As soon as they get clear, they\u2019ll send the Teras in somehow. I shudder, thinking along those lines. I remember all too well how their wings sounded swarming around me in the night, the screams of the dying, and the grotesque sight of bloodied body parts arcing into the wind, devoured in an invisible monstrous feast.</p><p>I\u2019m so busy reliving old nightmares that I don\u2019t know we\u2019ve got company until Dina shouts. The disruptor in her hand flashes with a wild shine, and someone screams in agony. Wherever she hit him will be raw meat, flesh scrambled inside out. Unless she hit him in the heart or the head, shock will kill him, not the injury itself.</p><p>As we get nearer, I see five McCullough scouts, red-eyed and rough. Dina has already dropped one, and she stays near the back, waiting for the weapon to cycle back up for another shot. The other three leap into the fray with a ferocity that steals my breath.</p><p>I pause, whip out my own shockstick, and assume the position in front of Dina. If anyone gets through our first line, I\u2019m not letting them get to her. I hear her snort at my protective position, but she doesn\u2019t protest.</p><p>Our new pilot wades in with her bare hands, assuming a fighting crouch that tells me she\u2019s had extensive hand-to-hand training. She validates her nickname by dodging a sloppy lunge and lays her first opponent out with an open-hand blow to his brow. He goes down like a stone.</p><p>I\u2019m amused when she flashes me a grin. \u201cI wasn\u2019t bragging, y\u2019know.\u201d</p><p>Vel carries hooked blades that he uses as an extension of his hands. Watching him fight, I realize they\u2019re intended to substitute for his hidden claws. Beside him, Jael spins like a dervish; he\u2019s all offense, all insane fury. He doesn\u2019t bother trying to protect himself, but then, I know why.</p><p>One of the McCulloughs dodges past, evidently thinking he\u2019ll use Dina as a hostage. I know what he figures. I\u2019m small, weak. I\u2019m no threat at all.</p><p>Well, the enforced rest has done me good, and after losing March, I feel like a fight. \u201cYou should run,\u201d I tell him with a feral grin.</p><p>I\u2019m Sirantha Jax, and I have had enough.</p><p>CHAPTER 34</p><p>The close confines of the tunnel favor the quick. l dodge a jab and wind to deliver a stinging blow to his right arm. I know from experience, he\u2019ll feel numb from the shoulder down for at least an hour.</p><p>These McCulloughs aren\u2019t as big as Gunnar lugs, but they\u2019re faster by comparison, and desperation lends them strength. They know if they don\u2019t kill us, they don\u2019t leave here alive. No prisoners, no exceptions.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna break your neck, bitch.\u201d His breath reeks from two paces away. They must\u2019ve been down here a long time. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll do your crippled friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need two good hands for that.\u201d I toss the shockstick between my hands, distracting him from Dina. The weapon hums with the motion, providing a bass beat for the symphony of grunts and groans.</p><p>He lunges at me, probably trying to work a lock. I whirl away, never taking my eyes off him, but he manages to sink a fist into my side. The breath wheezes out of me. I take a moment to be grateful he didn\u2019t stress any of my bones, and then he bull-rushes, slams me into the wall. Pain sparks down my spine. I\u2019m slower than I used to be, and he\u2019s like a mad beast.</p><p>In retaliation, I drive all my weight onto his foot. When he winces, I go for his eyes. There\u2019s a soft squish, and he screams like men shouldn\u2019t, all upper register and pure anguish. I shudder, but don\u2019t hesitate to follow up with a shockstick upside his head. Then he falls, a dull, heavy sound.</p><p>Dina holds her fire, too risky now that our bodies are between her and the enemy. I\u2019m glad she doesn\u2019t want to rearrange our molecules. Shaking, I wipe my fingers on my pants. I can smell the blood, a sweet, coppery tang.</p><p>If I can, the Teras can. I try to strangle the thought, but it takes root like a poisonous vine.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Dina mutters. \u201cYou know when I get off this thing, I\u2019m gonna repay you for that.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t comment, though I hope she\u2019ll regain full use of her leg. Doc set her up with an immuno-implant to keep her from rejecting the new limb. He also prescribed a strict regimen of exercises. She\u2019s limped a step or two on her own, but the days when she stomps around like she used to are a long way off.</p><p>The other three fight with a grace that calls to mind a brutal piece of choreography. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019d just get in the way, so I continue to guard Dina while nursing my sore back. Once all the McCulloughs hit the ground, Jael kneels and cuts their throats with a murderous efficiency that makes me look away. His pale eyes glitter in the torch-tube\u2019s citrine glow.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want them on our backtrail,\u201d he says briefly.</p><p>\u201cNoted.\u201d I maneuver past the bodies.</p><p>Stepping over sends a shock all the way down my legs. I wonder if I\u2019ve dislocated something. It occurs to me that, thus far, my role as ambassador hasn\u2019t been as cushy as one might expect.</p><p>Dina whirs forward on her sled, and Vel takes point again. He glances back long enough to ask, \u201cEveryone all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t be better.\u201d Yes, I exaggerate.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Hit answers with a smile. \u201cBut the smell is nasty. Let\u2019s get on.\u201d</p><p>Nobody else seems to notice that a long slash on Jael\u2019s arm has now closed itself up. His blood-soaked clothing offers camouflage as well. With everything happening at once and the uncertain light, it\u2019s easy to miss, or to think you were mistaken. I know better.</p><p>My bodyguard falls in behind me, serving as rear guard. \u201cThanks,\u201d he murmurs, low. \u201cMost of this crew doesn\u2019t know anything about me, and I\u2019d like to keep it that way.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cWe all have shit we\u2019d rather didn\u2019t come to light. In your case, though, Jael, you didn\u2019t do anything. You didn\u2019t ask for any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat hasn\u2019t stopped people trying to kill me just to see how long it\u2019ll take for me to die,\u201d he returns. \u201cAnd let\u2019s not even get started with the zealots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>I push down the raw grief clawing at me, trying to compartmentalize. At this moment I need another Jax, one who\u2019s tough and capable, but she won\u2019t manifest. I can\u2019t banish this loss as I have so many others. March got to me the way nobody ever has, burrowed beneath my skin in a way that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get over him. And I\u2019ve lost enough people to know.</p><p>Glenna, my best friend from the academy, burned out faster than most. She was twenty-three when she died. I said some empty words at her service, took some mental-health days, and drank myself stupid in some scroungy spaceport bar. And I haven\u2019t thought about her in ten turns. Odd that her memory would surface here, now.</p><p>I shake off the melancholy, noticing that the tunnels seem to be sloping up. At first I\u2019m not sure because it\u2019s subtle, but as we go along, I decide the bounty hunter\u2019s leading us in the right direction. The new pilot sticks close to Vel, shadowing him as he guides us around corners. His handheld feeds him data he doesn\u2019t bother sharing. We only need to know about bad news coming at us.</p><p>So much stone. The ceilings are barely tall enough for Hit to pass without stooping. She\u2019s easily as tall as Jael. I draw my fingers along the walls as we move, listening for the telltale sound of wings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Instead I feel a gust of air, which shouldn\u2019t exist down here. A draft can mean only one thing. I pause, spin, and then tilt my head back.</p><p>In the darkness I can barely make out a ragged hole above our heads. The broken stone doesn\u2019t look as though the Gunnars included this in their original construction either. Dread crawls over me like maggots from an old corpse.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>My worst fear, realized.</p> <p>Everyone glances back at Jael and me. Since he\u2019s right beside me, he catches on first. The merc tips his head back, and asks, \u201cHow close are we to the surface?\u201d</p><p>Vel taps on his handheld. \u201cIn a direct vertical line, or as the tunnels run?\u201d</p><p>In running a hand through his hair, Jael reveals his impatience with Vel\u2019s precision. \u201cAs the tunnels run, unless you can take us straight up this shaft.\u201d</p><p>Even assuming her sled had that much lift, Dina couldn\u2019t clear the opening, so I take that for a rhetorical question. I can\u2019t imagine how she feels, if she\u2019s put the pieces together. These monsters I\u2019m so scared of, they ate part of her. I don\u2019t know how she isn\u2019t one giant ball of terror.</p><p>Hit taps a booted foot gently, as if she thinks we\u2019re wasting time with all this jawing. Maybe she has a point. The longer we stand around down here, the more chance they\u2019ll find us.</p> <p>\u201cNearly two kilometers,\u201d the bounty hunter answers at last. \u201cBut it winds around, so it will take twice as long as a straight hike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to assume the tunnels ahead are infested,\u201d Dina says flatly. \u201cVel, can you get a message back to camp? They need to know the bunker\u2019s not as safe as they thought. With the wounded, the Teras will find them sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>My imagination supplies the details. Death exploding into an unsuspecting camp with claws and fangs. Rending, devouring\u2014I have to shut down the images; they come too quick and violent for me to bear. If they get to Keri, Lex, and . . .</p><p>March.</p><p>Then the McCulloughs win. And I lose everything.</p><p>\u201cI can try.\u201d Vel punches keys, shifting this way and that.</p> <p>\u201cTry under here.\u201d I step back, making room beneath the hole in the ceiling.</p><p>Maybe that will be enough. If he can\u2019t, we\u2019ll have to go back. Make our last stand with them. The others watch him with varying degrees of tension. I\u2019m not alone in how badly I want off this desolate rock.</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d he says, after an interminable moment. \u201cDr. Solaith should see the warning soon. I hope it gives them time to prepare.\u201d</p><p>We all heave a collective sigh. Part of me feels it isn\u2019t enough. I want to turn and run back down the dark stone passage toward March. It will drive me nuts, not knowing what happens here after we go.</p><p>I ache.</p><p>Only the fact that he made his choice prevents me from doing just that. Well, that and my secret, shameful fear of the dark. But March made it clear we\u2019re on diverging paths, and only time will tell whether that\u2019s always going to be the case. I don\u2019t have enough faith left in me to believe, but I curl my hand into a fist, fingering the cheap ring he gave me.</p><p>Ahead of us lies probable death and dismemberment. Behind us lies an encampment of weary, beleaguered clansmen with a war to fight. Talk about a rock and a hard place.</p><p>Two kilometers between us and daylight. I wonder if the dead we left behind will draw them, all hunger and keening sonic rage. Fighting Teras underground sounds like suicide. Fuck that. If I meant to take that route, I\u2019d have chosen an easy death. Made my appointment with a Psych, and then visited a clean, safe Eutha-booth.</p> <p>I sigh. \u201cSo what the hell do we do now?\u201d</p><p>Hit\u2019s teeth shine in the dark. \u201cWe kill the muthafuckers, one and all.\u201d</p><p>Easier said than done.</p><p>CHAPTER 35</p><p>My heart thuds in my ears.</p><p>I\u2019m conscious of each footfall, each scrape against stone. We try to move as a unit, permitting no space between us, but the soft hum from Dina\u2019s sled echoes down the corridors. Can the Teras detect vibrations? Each meter feels like a kilometer since I expect at any moment to hear the terrifying sound of wings.</p><p>\u201cThe passage will not permit them to swarm us,\u201d Vel says.</p><p>He\u2019s right. We can\u2019t even pass two abreast, and from what I recall, the Teras have a two-meter wingspan. So Vel will bear the brunt of a first attack. Perhaps his faux-human skill will shield him somewhat.</p><p>That\u2019s no guarantee he\u2019ll survive, however, if they rend him limb from limb. I wonder how his unique body chemistry will affect the monsters. I can\u2019t ask, though.</p><p>\u201cCan that thing detect movement?\u201d I nod at his handheld.</p><p>\u201cOrdinarily. The rock interferes somewhat with the readings, however.\u201d</p><p>Dina glances back at me over the rim of her sled. Her eyes glow with an odd radiance, echoes of the torch-tube. When she turns back, the light paints her fair hair with oily green streaks.</p><p>\u201cIf it comes down to it,\u201d she tells me, low. \u201cIf it\u2019s life and death and I\u2019m slowing you down, you leave me, Jax. They already had a taste of me, so they may as well have the rest.\u201d</p><p>A chill shivers through me. I remember Loras on his belly, shoving March toward me. I recognize self-sacrifice.</p><p>I\u2019ll be damned if it happens again.</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re not leaving anyone behind.\u201d Not this time. \u201cWe\u2019ll find a way to fight them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter hurry,\u201d Hit says, jerking her head at the red blurs on Vel\u2019s data screen. \u201cWe got two, just around the corner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a way,\u201d Jael says, pushing past me. \u201cJax, stay back, and keep the other two safe.\u201d</p><p>The pilot glares at his back. \u201cYou think I need your protection? I killed one of those monsters topside with nothing but a knife. I just need a ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you guard Jax and Dina,\u201d comes his response. \u201cYou ready, Vel?\u201d</p><p>The bounty hunter responds by tossing a weapon to Jael. They take up a position just around the corner, and I shudder, barely registering a keen of pure hunger from the beasts. I remember the way their song nearly killed poor Loras.</p><p>A burst of orange lightning zags from their hands, igniting the very air before them. The Teras\u2019 camouflage fails under such duress, and for an instant, I watch their silhouettes inside the pocket inferno, watch them writhe. Heat washes over me.</p><p>Fearing an explosion, I hit the floor, and Dina guides her sled over me. I appreciate the gesture; even now she\u2019s got my back. When I\u2019m greeted by the stench of sizzling meat, I chance a peek. Hit stands her ground, watching the monsters burn. Jael and Vel have designed something that propels an incendiary cloud.</p><p>\u201cWe will burn a path out.\u201d Vel holsters the oddly shaped weapon. \u201cThey cannot swarm us in the tunnels, and if we move cautiously, they will not detect us easily. I believe they utilize sonar to locate their prey.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t be the only one thinking this. \u201cWill their screams draw others?\u201d</p><p>The bounty hunter\u2019s answer drifts back to me over the hiss of smoldering flesh. \u201cIt is possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they can just line up to die,\u201d Jael says. \u201cI\u2019m so tired of this planet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us. Any chance you made a spare?\u201d With a nod, Hit indicates the weapon in his hand.</p><p>\u201cOnly these. Sorry. We can take turns if you prefer.\u201d Trust Vel to be scrupulously fair about who gets to barbecue the horrible things.</p><p>Personally, I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve seen what they can do; so has Dina. I suspect she and I are content to watch the action from a safe distance this time. After checking his handheld, Vel maneuvers past the smoking pile with a precision that once again reveals his inhuman nature, once you know what you\u2019re looking for. He waves us on.</p><p>The smell damn near makes me sick. There\u2019s no climate control down here, no ventilation, and the smell of charred meat flashes me dangerously close to the Sargasso. By itself, the dark was bad enough. Add this stench to it, and I struggle to stay in the here and now.</p><p>I grit my teeth until pain shoots up my jaw to my temple. I won\u2019t lose it. I\u2019m stronger than that. March would\u2019ve known how bad this is for me. I could\u2019ve counted on a touch on the shoulder, a reassuring nod. So would Doc, for that matter. But those days are gone.</p><p>And I have to deal with what is, not what was. Story of my life.</p><p>\u201cWatch your step.\u201d Jael guides us around the corpses.</p><p>Dina slaps at him, which improves my mood somewhat. I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s all right with the battlefield medicine that went into saving her life, but we don\u2019t have a Psych on hand. Just as well, most of them are crazy bastards. After all, look what they did to me in the name of mental health. When we get out of here, I\u2019ll fix her the Jax way: loads of liquor and some pretty girls.</p><p>Vel leads us out of that hallway and into the next turn. It\u2019s a maze, and I\u2019m hopelessly lost, just as I was when Doc found our way in. Dirtside, I have no sense of direction, something Kai loved teasing me about. When I got lost at the Gehenna starport market, he never let me live it down.</p><p>Oddly, thinking about him takes my mind off March. An older loss doesn\u2019t sting as much. The memories offer some comfort and distraction as we creep along, slaves to Vel\u2019s handheld.</p><p>Listening for the rasp of talons and claws against the rock. A dragging sound or a leathery flap of wings. Sonic shrieks echo in the distance, making the hair on the back of my neck stand on end. My nipples perk from the chills running over me steadily, like I have a fever. But I don\u2019t think fear counts as an illness.</p><p>They\u2019re here with us. Hunting. Coming closer, each turn we make. Mary help us, will I never see the sky again?</p><p>In Jael\u2019s hand the torch-tube starts to flicker, casting odd shadows along the floor, and then it winks out. At first I\u2019m just blind; it\u2019s like that long moment after I jack in, but before we jump. And then the walls kindle with their own light, a pale, ethereal twinkle that reminds me of the stars.</p><p>\u201cThe stone is full of phosphorus,\u201d Vel says in a hushed tone.</p><p>Once my eyes adjust, it\u2019s better than the tubes, more pervasive. I feel less like we\u2019re scuttling along in the oily dark, huddled in our tiny isle of illumination. It also smells fresher now that we\u2019ve moved away from the funeral pyre.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean something?\u201d Hit asks him.</p><p>Vel lifts his shoulders. \u201cProbably. But I lack the time for extended study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit. You remind me of Doc sometimes.\u201d Dina sounds more herself, less the sacrificial lamb.</p><p>\u201cI will take that as a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant as one,\u201d she mutters.</p><p>Ahead of Dina, Hit smothers a chuckle. \u201cShould we leave you two alone?\u201d</p><p>Now I laugh. I sense more than see the puzzled look the pilot casts over her shoulder at me, so I explain, \u201cDina doesn\u2019t like men, and Vel, well . . .\u201d</p><p>As a Slider, he can grow human skin to pass among us, concealing his mantis form. But I\u2019m not going to out him since Hit hasn\u2019t seen him au naturel. No more than I\u2019ll tell her about Jael being Bred. Like I told him before, we all have our secrets.</p><p>Vel surprises me by finishing the sentence with a flicker of that dry sense of humor that occasionally rears its head. \u201cLet us say she is not my type.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For the first time, I wonder what that would be. He said he left Ithiss-Tor because sexual relations between his people sometimes became deadly. So that means he\u2019s been alone this whole time? Not that it\u2019s any of my business.</p><p>On some level, I\u2019m aware I\u2019m losing myself in these inane speculations in order to distract myself from the soul-scouring fear engendered by the echoing shrieks. The Teras sound so goddamn close now; they should be on Vel\u2019s screen.</p><p>Two red signatures blossom on his handheld, dead ahead. Then two more, except they aren\u2019t where they\u2019re supposed to be.</p><p>The ceiling above us shakes, disintegrates like the dry dirt of an insect hive. Crumbles down on us in great clods that shimmer with the eerie light. I can\u2019t see them, but I can hear them overhead, claws working. Their terrible keens reverberate inside my skull, making me feel like my brains will bleed out my nose.</p> <p>\u201cBehind!\u201d Hit yells.</p><p>And then they come at us from both sides in a terrible rush.</p><p>CHAPTER 36</p><p>Jael spins and fires, a ruddy orange cone jetting from his weapon. Ahead of us, Vel takes the ones coming down the corridor in front. Then we\u2019re trapped.</p><p>Burning on both sides, like standing in the middle of a charnel house and praying you don\u2019t catch, too. I shake all over.</p> <p>Shrill cries of rage echo through the tunnels. The smell seems to enrage the ones trying to get at us from above, but the opening isn\u2019t quite big enough yet. Claws rasping, they make a hole like the one I saw half a kilometer back.</p><p>Hit eyes the ones above and then leaps. Her knife shimmers in a silver arc as she stabs at . . . nothing. But somehow she hits. The Tera screams in agony. When she severs the claw, it drops in a spatter of green fluid and lies visible on the softly glowing stone floor, opening and closing as the nerve endings die. Apparently the smell of blood, any blood, maddens them. Because overhead, an ominous thump and another scream says the monsters have turned on each other.</p><p>\u201cMove!\u201d Vel shouts.</p><p>Agreed. We don\u2019t want to be here when the ceiling gives way entirely. Ahead, the two Teras still twist and char, inky black smoke roiling from their putrid flesh.</p><p>\u201cDive and roll,\u201d Jael adds. \u201cApart from Dina of course. You should have enough lift to get past them. If your clothing catches, don\u2019t panic.\u201d</p><p>Easy for him to say. He doesn\u2019t have burn scars.</p> <p>The bounty hunter leaps past with a well-timed spring, hits the stone floor with his hands, and tucks into a neat roll. Hit follows suit with a natural grace that suggests she\u2019d be dangerous on the dance floor, too. Cursing, Dina maneuvers until she can glide by. In its death throes, one of the creatures sends her careening into the tunnel wall.</p><p>She skids in a shower of sparks to the end of the corridor, where Hit stops the sled with a boot. \u201cI\u2019ve seen better flying from a drunk aircab driver.\u201d</p><p>Occupied with stabilizing the sled, Dina mutters, \u201cBite me,\u201d in lieu of a more creative comeback.</p><p>The pilot grins. \u201cI just might.\u201d</p><p>Dina\u2019s head comes up, her face pale. But before I hear what she says, Jael gives me a shove from behind. \u201cGet moving, Jax.\u201d</p><p>As if to punctuate his words, a huge chunk of rock crashes to the floor just in front of me. The fight going on overhead sounds savage. Terrifying. Five meters above, they\u2019re devouring each other alive and shattering stone in the process.</p><p>But I can\u2019t. There\u2019s actual fire curling from the sizzling meat. He\u2019s lucky I haven\u2019t puked all over his boots.</p><p>\u201cJael,\u201d I begin shakily.</p> <p>\u201cOh, for Mary\u2019s sake,\u201d he bites out. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you don\u2019t weigh much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWha\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cVel! Think fast.\u201d</p><p>And then I\u2019m launched, sailing toward the bounty hunter. Everything blurs as I tumble, crash into him, and go down. Jael lands on top of me in an ungainly pile. I suspect he may have cracked my rib with his knee, but before I can bitch about that, the tunnel collapses in a great mound of rubble and dust.</p><p>There\u2019s no going back now. I couldn\u2019t get to March even if I wanted to. Mary, I hope the warning came in time.</p><p>Three more red shapes appear on Vel\u2019s handheld. And lucky us\u2014they\u2019re on our side of the block.</p><p>Hit nudges Dina farther down the new passage as Jael shoves my head down. Vel fires over the top of us, lighting the closest one. They\u2019re not smart, these Teras, because they try to push past, and then shriek as they\u2019re burned. We see their flesh where it chars. It\u2019s odd, like a tear in consensual reality: seeing a shadow suddenly flare into full view through a tendril of licking flame.</p><p>Jael fires twice more in quick succession, engulfing all three of them. In narrow tunnels where we control our movements, these monsters are vulnerable. First they can\u2019t spot us easily, and then they\u2019re alight.</p><p>When we reach the surface, it will be a different hunt for them.</p><p>\u201cHalfway there,\u201d Vel says as we get our breath. He sets me on my feet. \u201cAnything broken?\u201d</p><p>I wince and rub my side. \u201cNot sure. But I\u2019m ambulatory, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better be,\u201d Dina says. \u201cYou\u2019re not hitching a ride.\u201d</p><p>Flicking a look at Jael, I ignore her for the time being. \u201cYou really believe in tough love,\u201d I mutter, sotto voce.</p><p>It\u2019s a throwaway complaint. I\u2019ve made thousands of them in my life. In fact, I should be thanking him for saving my ass.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in love at all,\u201d he returns, equally quiet. \u201cIt\u2019s just a name people give the endorphins that spring up after some really hot fucking, and the justification they use to manipulate the shit out of each other afterward. Now move your ass. I want to see starlight sometime soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it nightfall?\u201d Hit asks. \u201cI\u2019ve lost track of time down here.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right. I don\u2019t even know what time we left the camp or how many days we were down there. Without a sunrise to help mark its passage or a ship\u2019s computer to keep track for me, I have no more sense of time than I do direction.</p><p>\u201cThere are four hours left until daybreak,\u201d Vel advises us, after some tapping on his handheld.</p><p>\u201cHow long will this last kilometer take?\u201d Dina wants to know.</p><p>I\u2019m glad she asked because now I don\u2019t have to. My shoulder aches from hauling my pack. I hope 245 is okay in there. After Vel snatched me in Maha City, she asked me to install her in a droid body. She didn\u2019t enjoy watching what happened without being able to impact events, which means I was right about her AI chip. Since we\u2019ve been together, she\u2019s evolved from her original function, and I now consider her a friend.</p><p>As a bonus, she\u2019ll also prove invaluable as an aide. If I upgrade her, she can function as my assistant on Ithiss-Tor, too. She\u2019ll coach me on customs and etiquette with a precision no human aide could match. So once we\u2019re out of here, I\u2019ll see about buying her a body from Pretty Robotics. When I have cred, that is.</p><p>Of course I could take Jael\u2019s advice and charge it to Chancellor Tarn. He wouldn\u2019t quibble over a personal aide, would he? Never mind that I could hire a human one much cheaper than I could requisition a suitable frame for 245.</p><p>My internal monologue keeps me sane. I manage to filter out the distant stench of acrid smoke that\u2019s burning our oxygen. Block out the tons of stone that make me feel like I\u2019ve been buried alive. Mary, I have so many hang-ups. If I wasn\u2019t scared of them, too, I\u2019d see a Psych about it.</p><p>People would laugh their asses off if they knew how much of my tough act comes from pure pretense. During our plodding progress, Vel checks and double-checks to make sure there are no deadly surprises lurking around each turn. I keep my eyes on Dina\u2019s sled. It has a series of lights along the bottom, giving a faint glow that frosts the metal.</p><p>The others watch the tiny screen on Vel\u2019s handheld. We\u2019re slaves to it. I\u2019m aware that the tiniest mechanical malfunction could cost our lives. And technology has a tendency to break down around me for no apparent reason.</p><p>I remember the busted phase drive we suffered on the Folly, just after we reached Marakeq. From what Dina said, there was no logical reason for it. And that kind of thing happens to me all the time. When our Skimmer exploded, I thought that might\u2019ve been me, too, until I learned otherwise.</p><p>For like the fifth time, Jael asks, \u201cAnything?\u201d</p><p>Until even Vel loses patience with him. \u201cHave I failed even once to alert you if there was?\u201d</p><p>Damn. That\u2019s Vel-speak for, Will you please shut the fuck up already? I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s ever managed to get on the bounty hunter\u2019s nerves before. To my knowledge, he\u2019s the king of cool. I don\u2019t know whether Jael should be praised or pitied for this accomplishment.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the merc says grudgingly. \u201cSorry. The quiet\u2019s just making me nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like the eye of the storm,\u201d Hit agrees. \u201cYou can sense something\u2019s coming, feel it prickling over your skin, but you don\u2019t know what until it explodes in your face.\u201d</p><p>To my surprise Dina laughs. Might be the first time I\u2019ve heard her do so since the attack that maimed her. \u201cI think I like you.\u201d</p><p>Hit flicks a look over one shoulder. \u201cYou flirting with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to be?\u201d Dina actually tosses back her hair.</p><p>\u201cThat depends on your intentions.\u201d Damn, but the woman put some heat into that. I even felt it, and I\u2019ve never hit on a woman when I wasn\u2019t drunk.</p><p>\u201cIs it dirty that this turns me on?\u201d Jael asks nobody in particular.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Vel answers, without looking away from the device that\u2019s saved our lives. I can\u2019t fault him for that. I\u2019m also impressed with his coordination; I\u2019d have walked into several walls by now. \u201cAhead, it looks like the incline to the surface.\u201d</p><p>As if in answer, a cool, fresh wind blows down over us.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we waiting for?\u201d Hit demands. \u201cLet\u2019s get the hell out of here!\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 37</p><p>There\u2019s an actual door at the top of the slope, a solid metal one meant to keep stuff out. I hope it\u2019s well camouflaged on the other side. We pause here, with freedom on the other side of the door. We\u2019ll have to navigate the lock to get out, but one thing at a time. At this point, preparation is key.</p><p>\u201cIs anyone bleeding?\u201d Jael asks. \u201cCheck carefully. I have some liquid skin if you are. We need to seal you up.\u201d</p><p>Everyone conducts an inspection, and we find minor scrapes here and there. The merc oversees the application of the liquid skin, making sure we\u2019re ready to go out in the wind. Dina\u2019s fingers are raw from where she hit the wall.</p><p>I find a scratch on my elbow. Hell, I\u2019m lucky it\u2019s not worse, the way Jael hurled me like a javelin. I\u2019m not particularly aerodynamic.</p><p>\u201cThis might sting a little,\u201d Jael murmurs.</p><p>Why is he smiling? I hiss as he squirts my elbow, and I feel the sealant bond with my existing skin. Best bandage in a bottle that credits can buy.</p><p>\u201cEveryone good?\u201d Lofting the liquid skin, Jael checks us all one last time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry, and I\u2019m sick of your face,\u201d Dina bitches beneath her breath. Loud enough for everyone to hear.</p><p>Jael really isn\u2019t the guy I thought, because he surprises me with a sharp laugh. \u201cI\u2019m sure that goes for everybody else, too. But let\u2019s break out the paste. You make a good point. We don\u2019t know just how far we\u2019ll have to hike to steal a ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know?\u201d Hit jabs the merc in the chest with both index fingers. I wince in sympathy, but he doesn\u2019t seem to feel it. \u201cI thought you and the professor over here had things planned down to the last millimeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot take topography readings underground,\u201d Vel explains in a deceptively mild tone. \u201cBut we will make for the nearest public hangar. If it comes to it, we can stay there until the Conglomerate dispatches a ship. There will be rudimentary amenities available.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHit.\u201d Dina puts a hand on the other woman\u2019s arm briefly. \u201cCool down. Shit, if I\u2019m willing to risk it with a bum leg, you can be sure these guys know what they\u2019re doing. \u2019Cause I don\u2019t even like \u2019em. Especially her.\u201d</p><p>Now that\u2019s the Dina I know and love. Mary, I\u2019m glad to see a spark. I flash her a broad grin. \u201cRight back at you, bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d But the pilot does step back, looking perceptibly calmer.</p><p>Then we enjoy a meal of nutri-paste. It\u2019s been so long since I had real food that my teeth feel like they\u2019re getting soft. Maybe you can live forever off this stuff as the manufacturer claims, but I\u2019m starting to think I\u2019d rather die.</p><p>I daydream about fresh fruits and vegetables, drizzled with a sweet tangy sauce. Maybe some strong white cheese, just a bit smoky. Oooh, and hot bread, crisp on the outside and tender on the inside, brushed with a hint of butter.</p> <p>\u201cClose your mouth,\u201d Jael whispers. \u201cYou\u2019re drooling. If you\u2019re not careful, people will realize you\u2019re thinking about me naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you have a warm baguette and a crock of butter in your hands,\u201d I return darkly.</p><p>He grins at me. \u201cThat can be arranged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d I suck down the rest of my paste, quietly stewing because he destroyed the food fantasy that made this goop tolerable.</p><p>Vel clears his throat with a look that manages to be vaguely disapproving. What? I didn\u2019t do anything.</p><p>\u201cNext . . . we need this.\u201d The bounty hunter tosses me a tube of Thermud, and I eye it with dislike. Merc grunts swear by this stuff, but surely we don\u2019t\u2014oh, frag. Of course we do. We\u2019re about to emerge from a bunker in the middle of two clans at war. I smear the stuff on without protest.</p> <p>Hit, on the other hand, looks at Vel like she thinks he\u2019s crazy. \u201cI\u2019m already dark enough to blend in, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for high-tech,\u201d Jael tells her. \u201cThis stuff scrambles your heat signature so it bleeds off into the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking thermal goggles useless.\u201d She takes the tube from me and covers all her exposed skin.</p><p>Dina uses it next, but I can tell by her expression she thinks it\u2019s a waste of time. Her sled is pretty damn conspicuous. But we can only do so much to stack the deck in our favor\u2014got to leave the rest to chance.</p><p>Too bad Lady Luck\u2019s so often a bitch.</p><p>Watching Jael daub himself, I can definitely tell he\u2019s used it before. His hands practically blur in the speed of the motions. \u201cWe all set?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come he doesn\u2019t have to use it?\u201d Hit jerks her head toward Vel.</p><p>Who manages an approximation of a smile. He\u2019s getting better at pretending to be human. \u201cBecause I am special, of course.\u201d</p> <p>He ignores her pissed-off exclamation as he goes to work on the electronic lock. Right now the display shows red. If it requires a ret-scan or a handprint, we are utterly screwed.</p><p>Or not.</p><p>Vel slips on a clear synthetic glove, pulls the tips tight, and lays his palm on the panel. The AI intones, \u201cThank you, Dr. Solaith. Clearance granted.\u201d</p><p>The light flashes green, and the heavy door swings wide. That hint of a breeze we\u2019ve been feeling for a while turns into a gust. I drink it in without minding the chill racing over me. It\u2019s still winter, a lot of darkness and short daylight hours.</p><p>\u201cHe was kind enough to let me borrow his fingerprints before we left,\u201d Vel says as he steps out.</p><p>Tentatively, we follow suit, single file, coming up against what seems to be a rockslide. We sidle past the narrow gap, and for a moment, I\u2019m afraid Dina will have to leave the sled. I don\u2019t know how the hell we\u2019ll carry her.</p><p>Without a word, she straps herself in, lowers the back so she\u2019s fully horizontal. She tests the strength of her belts and then flips to vertical. Her fingers seem sure on the buttons.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she says, when Hit tries to help guide the sled. \u201cI got this.\u201d</p><p>Now and then she scrapes the stone, throwing sparks, but she manages. I admire her so damn much. But her face is taut with tension by the time we step out onto the hillside.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I step closer as she switches the sled back to chair configuration.</p><p>\u201cI gotta get out of this thing,\u201d she tells me, jaw set. \u201cOr I\u2019ll kill somebody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d I promise. \u201cGet out of it, I mean. I\u2019ll help. The killing probably depends on how much they piss you off.\u201d</p><p>I want to say more, but this isn\u2019t the time. We need to move. For just a moment, though, I tip my head back, glorying in the icy stars.</p><p>From this higher vantage, I see that the clansmen piled those rocks before the opening to make it look like a natural formation. They did a good job concealing their escape route; I\u2019ll give them that. But it\u2019s not as impregnable as they thought. It\u2019s compromised now, full of dying McCulloughs and hungry monsters.</p><p>Mary, I hope March makes it out of there. I touch the ring on my finger out of superstition, faith, or some awkward marriage between the two. In an effort to push back the pain trying to drown me, I suck in several deep, gulping breaths of cold air.</p><p>He\u2019s my pilot, and I have to fly without him soon.</p><p>Jumpers aren\u2019t made for this.</p><p>I expected to emerge amid the wreckage of the Gunnar-Dahlgren compound, but we\u2019ve surfaced well away from there. No broken machinery, no rubble. No signs of bombardment. There are just barren hills, riddled with signs of the honeycomb caverns that house the Teras.</p><p>The open worries me more than the tunnels. Down there we could control the approach, limit how many could get at us. Up here we\u2019re free targets, dinner afoot.</p><p>\u201cNo running,\u201d Vel cautions again. \u201cWe have no way of knowing how the Teras interpret rapid footfalls or how far sound travels through the caverns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo our best to step lightly,\u201d I say. \u201cCheck.\u201d</p><p>The bounty hunter pauses a moment to check the readings, and then adds, \u201cThis way. We need to get as far from here as we can before daylight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask before Hit gets the chance, and she acknowledges it with a grin. I really like her. She\u2019s competent, confident, and doesn\u2019t accept things at face value.</p><p>If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that I\u2019m missing March like a lost limb\u2014glad I didn\u2019t say that aloud, or Dina would hurt me\u2014I\u2019d even be glad to have Hit as my new pilot. I\u2019m just not ready to make her part of me.</p><p>But when am I ever?</p><p>\u201cBecause there\u2019s a storm coming.\u201d Vel flashes his handheld.</p><p>The merc sighs. \u201cLooks like a lot of snow. We don\u2019t have nearly enough survival gear to handle that. We need to find a ship and fast. All right, people, forced march, double time.\u201d</p><p>We fall in behind Vel in twos, Dina and Hit, then Jael and me. I hate how he won\u2019t leave my side now, as if trying to make up for his prior lack of vigilance. I\u2019m too tired to care at this point or work up any rancor. I just wish he\u2019d leave me alone.</p><p>\u201cDamn, it\u2019s cold.\u201d I don\u2019t realize I\u2019ve spoken aloud until I see his smirk.</p><p>\u201cYou should really keep a coat in that pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should really fuck off and die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who\u2019ll save your ass when you panic over a bit of barbecue?\u201d</p><p>I give the response my most withering tone. \u201cThe next monkey Tarn hires. See, that\u2019s my gift. Being the last one standing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf everyone you give a shit about is gone, sounds more like a curse.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 38</p><p>He gets it.</p><p>That startles me. I don\u2019t offer confirmation that he\u2019s right, though. I don\u2019t want to talk.</p><p>But yeah, some days it does seem more like a curse, just like that guy from mythology who doesn\u2019t die, who\u2019s destined to wander and suffer. But I can\u2019t sustain that level of mental melodrama.</p><p>Pure physical discomfort edges out such self-pity. I can\u2019t even find the energy to fret about working with Hit, or how the next jump will affect my condition. I know Doc doesn\u2019t want me to jump, but he should\u2019ve cut off my arm if he wanted to prevent me from jacking in.</p><p>Nothing else will keep me from grimspace. Even now, the siren song makes me feel itchy with need. The colors, the feeling that comes howling through me as my mind expands. I need to be there like I need nothing else.</p><p>More than March even. I\u2019m sure he knows that. That\u2019s what happens when you love a junkie.</p><p>As we walk, clouds blot out the shimmer of the stars overhead. The storm Vel predicted appears to be rolling in on schedule, and as the wind kicks up, it goes right through me. You\u2019d think I\u2019d have remembered how cold it is here, though to be fair, I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d never be returning to the ship.</p><p>I feel like a prisoner of war.</p><p>We can\u2019t stop moving, but I can barely put one foot in front of the other. I hate this weakness. Though I feel better than I did on Emry, I\u2019m a long way from full strength. The others seem to be bearing up all right. Up ahead, I hear the low susurration of voices: Dina and Hit, getting to know each other.</p><p>As always, Vel leads the way in silence. Though I count him among my closest friends, I don\u2019t know much about him. That\u2019s not likely to change while we forge a desperate path through these hills.</p><p>Up and down we climb, avoiding scout droids, McCullough patrols, and, of course, the Teras, who will swarm and devour us if they catch our scent. But between the liquid skin and Thermud, we\u2019ve taken as many precautions against that outcome as we can. My thighs and calves burn, taut as drawn wire.</p><p>Add that to various aches, including a stabbing pain where Jael landed on me, and I\u2019d give just about anything to lie down. Of course I suspect I\u2019d never get up again. I didn\u2019t realize how soft I\u2019d gotten, but a jumper\u2019s life is well padded.</p><p>\u201cYou holding up all right?\u201d Jael asks, well after I\u2019ve lost track of how long we\u2019ve been walking.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d I mumble.</p><p>I don\u2019t see how we\u2019ll be in any shape to steal a ship once we finally get there. But we can\u2019t pitch camp in the open, and a cavern in these hills would be worse.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he answers. \u201cI\u2019m just making small talk.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have a better idea. No talk. That\u2019s been working like a charm for hours.\u201d</p><p>The bounty hunter glances back at me. In this light, his faux-human skin looks a little mottled. It\u2019s probably time for him to slough it off and grow new, but he won\u2019t do that while he needs the insulation.</p><p>\u201cSirantha, it will serve no purpose if you become ill.\u201d With an annoyed sound, he delves into his pack and fishes out a tissue-thin insulated suit, maybe the same one I wore on the Teresengi Basin.</p><p>It\u2019s not that cold, but I scramble into it. I hope my body heat, thus trapped, will warm me up soon. I wince in anticipation because when the feeling returns, it\u2019s going to hurt.</p> <p>Ahead, Dina asks Vel, \u201cHow much farther?\u201d</p><p>She isn\u2019t asking out of weariness or personal discomfort. Shit, now I know what the lights at the base of her sled mean. They\u2019ve all dimmed but two. If we don\u2019t find a power source before that last light goes out, she\u2019ll be stranded.</p><p>\u201cFour kilometers due west from here,\u201d Vel answers. \u201cWe\u2019ll find a hangar.\u201d</p><p>Like the one where we landed the first time instead of going directly to the compound. They\u2019re maintained by droids and bots, officially independent of clan allegiance. Merchant ships often put down there when they have to deliver supplies on planet to multiple stops; it forestalls accusations of partisan dealings.</p><p>I nearly crack my jaw with a yawn. Four kilometers. Under optimum conditions in the training room, I ran that without breaking a sweat.</p> <p>That was a long time, another lifetime, ago.</p><p>Far be it for me to question the leadership that\u2019s gotten us this far, but . . . well, someone has to. \u201cWhat if no ships are docked there?\u201d</p><p>They don\u2019t tend to stay long between dirtside deliveries anyway. Plus, the recent unrest on Lachion will have made some merchant vessels reluctant to risk it. Things won\u2019t return to normal here for a while, though weapons vendors may try their luck. They always do a brisk trade on Nicuan.</p><p>\u201cWhy borrow trouble?\u201d Jael shakes his head and sighs.</p><p>\u201cI never borrow it. That implies it wasn\u2019t mine to start with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good question,\u201d Hit puts in quietly. \u201cAnd I\u2019d like it answered.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps it\u2019s simply the hollow hills, but in the silence that follows, the wind carries in a dolorous howl. I imagine wild animals just beyond my line of sight, less terrible than the Teras, but just as hungry. How do the clans survive such a savage world, so far from city lights and the safety of space?</p><p>\u201cI do not know,\u201d Vel says at last. By Jael\u2019s astonished look, he didn\u2019t expect that answer either. We wait, hoping there\u2019s more. \u201cIf nothing else, we will find a secure place to rest and bounce a message to New Terra. The McCulloughs cannot attack us on neutral territory without breaching seven interstellar accords.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t like the thought of waiting for rescue when anything can go wrong and usually does. As if in response, the first delicate snowflakes drift down, stick and shimmer in Hit\u2019s dark hair. She brushes them away and spins to see the white curtain coming down. Soon this winter loveliness will sting.</p><p>\u201cAt least I\u2019ll be able to charge this thing.\u201d Dina slaps the side of the sled and then tips her head back to study the sky. \u201cBut I think we need to pick up the pace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot that right.\u201d Beside me, Jael breaks into a jog that looks disgustingly effortless. \u201cDon\u2019t fall behind, Jax.\u201d</p><p>He should be exhausted by now, scruffy and unshaven. Instead he\u2019s just bloodstained and dirty like the rest of us. I don\u2019t see weariness in his eyes, just a stupidly teasing light, like this is some big adventure.</p><p>Well, maybe to him, it is. Maybe Jael has endless reserves, thanks to his Bred heritage. I know he can heal from wounds that would kill anyone else.</p><p>As for me, I miss March, and I want a shower. I wouldn\u2019t say no to some of the perks that an ambassador is reputed to receive. Thus far, I\u2019ve gotten nothing but murder attempts out of my time on the job.</p> <p>With a scowl, I raise my knees and force myself to run. Each jolt over rocky ground sends a shock of pain down my side. No problem. I\u2019ll just pretend this is the training room, and I\u2019m in peak form. No injury, no illness.</p><p>Shit, if I can do all that, why don\u2019t I just wish us off this rock?</p><p>When Dina accelerates, the second-to-last light flickers and blinks out. Hope that single cell has enough juice to take her four kilometers. Vel doesn\u2019t let her pass him, though. He increases his own rate of movement to stay a meter ahead of us.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how he monitors his handheld and keeps an eye on the horizon at the same time. It must be an Ithtorian gift because I would\u2019ve tripped over my own feet by now. He keeps one eye on each object, something humans just can\u2019t do.</p><p>The snow falls heavier with each passing moment. In a way it\u2019s good because it\u2019ll cover our tracks. Thanks to the Thermud, that also means we\u2019re five dark figures streaking over a white hillside and down into the valley.</p><p>Nothing but open plains from here on out.</p><p>Our \u201ccamouflage\u201d makes us easier to spot, so I hope no McCulloughs lie between us and the hangar. The snow stings, catching in my lashes and numbing the visible portion of my face. Though I\u2019m not the praying sort, I cycle certain thoughts in a mantra timed to my racing heart.</p><p>Please let there be a ship.</p><p>Please let us get there safely.</p><p>Please let Dina\u2019s sled hold out.</p><p>Whether I\u2019m entreating Mother Mary or Lady Luck herself, I couldn\u2019t say. I just know when the building looms up out of the storm, blocky and ugly as an old Gehenna whore, I\u2019ve never been so glad to see anything in my life.</p><p>Because I don\u2019t think I can go another step.</p><p>CHAPTER 39</p><p>Jael winds up carrying me the last two hundred meters.</p><p>I don\u2019t even bitch about it, though I know he\u2019ll never let me live it down. No, I didn\u2019t ask for help, but I guess the part where I stumbled and fell on my face sort of clued him in. He\u2019s not an idiot, even if he\u2019s beyond annoying.</p><p>Because he knows the emergency protocols, Vel keys us into the hangar. The doors hiss open, hinting at the delicious warmth awaiting us within. Since our luck usually works that way, I expect a firing squad to be waiting for us, or maybe a random pack of Morgut. I peer around the place.</p><p>Nothing so far.</p><p>After everything we\u2019ve gone through in this hellhole, it can\u2019t be so easy, can it? But maybe we\u2019re due a break. Maybe.</p><p>Like desperate pilgrims, we stumble inside. Hard light floods my eyes, a shocking change from the winter landscape. I take quick stock of our surroundings: thick metal walls, high, open ceilings with fans and ducts in plain view. Apart from droids going about routine maintenance, the hangar is quiet.</p><p>There\u2019s a ship.</p><p>A big one, too. Shiny and silver, it dominates the docking area. If there\u2019s anyone aboard, they\u2019re likely asleep since we\u2019ve arrived just before dawn. Hopefully, the vessel belongs to some unsuspecting merchant who\u2019s out in a land vehicle, innocently delivering spare parts. Maybe stuck in the snowstorm.</p><p>And I don\u2019t give a shit about stranding him. If things go poorly out there, he might not need his ship back after all. But first we have to figure out how to steal it. I don\u2019t expect that\u2019ll be instantaneous, because only a fool would outfit a fine cruiser like this and then not lock it up tight as a virgin\u2019s legs.</p><p>The AI greets us politely as we cross the floor. \u201cWelcome to Hangar 47-A. It is unlawful to participate in aggressive activity in this space. If you use projectile weapons, please activate the safety mechanisms now. Please remove power cells from items such as sonicblades and disruptors. Please stow all other dangerous devices. If you refuse to comply, a Peacemaker unit will be dispatched to your location, you will be neutralized, and we will conduct a thorough inspection of your belongings. All contraband will be confiscated to fund the operation of Hangar 47-A. Thank you for your cooperation.\u201d</p><p>I laugh softly because all I have is a shockstick. I drop it into my backpack and I\u2019m done. Swaying on my feet, I watch the others scramble to deal with their weapons before we\u2019re dubbed dangerous, and the droids react accordingly. Hit removes a ridiculous amount of armament from her person, cursing all the while.</p><p>Small circular units hover nearby, monitoring our progress. When we finish, the courteous, inhuman voice says, \u201cThank you. Please avail yourself of all public facilities until departure.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m surprised it didn\u2019t ask us to visit the gift shop. We didn\u2019t linger long in the hangar, the first time I visited, and I\u2019m starting to see why. Having everything so well orchestrated by machines makes me feel oddly extraneous.</p><p>\u201cIs it me, or is there something spooky about being the only living things around here?\u201d Hit asks, glancing around.</p><p>She rubs her hands up and down her arms, the first outward sign of nervousness I\u2019ve seen from her. So the pilot doesn\u2019t like droids. Interesting, considering that she\u2019ll jack into the ship right next to me.</p><p>\u201cDroids are more reliable than people,\u201d Dina mutters.</p><p>Her sled gives an ominous whine, and I start looking for a place she can recharge. I point. \u201cOver there. You can patch into that power station, I think. Might want to do it soon.\u201d</p><p>She gives a nod. Hit follows her, as if expecting the mechanic will need a hand. I was going to, but it\u2019s probably better if Hit helps. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m strong enough.</p><p>To my vast delight, the climate control works just fine. Heat drifts down from the vents overhead, compensating for the weather. My teeth chatter as I strip out of the insulated suit and return it to Vel with a murmur of thanks. He stashes it in his pack, conduit to all good things.</p><p>I\u2019ve lost count of how many times he\u2019s saved my ass now. At this point I should just hand over the deed. Or maybe tattoo it with Property of Velith Il-Nok. That clinches it.</p><p>I\u2019m so fucking tired I\u2019m losing my mind.</p><p>\u201cI need some time with the computer.\u201d Vel pitches his voice loud enough to reach the other two, working on the sled. \u201cI can get the boarding codes and access the ship via remote, but I do not know how long that will take. I recommend the rest of you get warmed up and have something to eat. There should be a waiting area over there with basic amenities.\u201d He inclines his head. \u201cIn case of mechanical difficulties.\u201d</p><p>I watch Dina\u2019s halting steps toward the lounge, one arm slung around the pilot\u2019s neck. As they move off, Hit tells Dina, \u201cI\u2019ll help you get comfortable, and then scrounge up something to eat. Sound good?\u201d</p><p>The mechanic\u2019s voice carries back to me. \u201cMmm, prepacked vending chow. I\u2019ll buy. I need to get started on those rehab exercises, though. I\u2019ve been wearing an EMP band on my thigh, but that can\u2019t make up for plain hard work.\u201d</p><p>I definitely notice a vibe between those two, but then Dina scores more than any man I ever met. More than once, I\u2019ve seen her take home a girl who never looked twice at her own sex before. She\u2019s definitely gifted.</p><p>Don\u2019t ask me why I\u2019m not right there with them, looking for a place to crash. Or a vending unit that will sell me something to eat that isn\u2019t nutri-paste. Anything. I\u2019d kill for some choclaste right about now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vel heads toward a terminal, and I trudge after him. The AI warns him that\u2019s for official docking personnel only, but it doesn\u2019t deter him. After watching him mess with it for a few minutes, I\u2019m surprised that none of his high-tech gear can convince it to let him into their system.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Jael asks at my elbow.</p><p>I ignore him and dig through my pack looking for 245. She\u2019s a closed interface, but she might know of a backdoor in the security or a fail-safe included in the design. Mair provided her with an astonishingly eclectic database. Plus, 245 is the only Lachion native among us. That can\u2019t hurt.</p> <p>I power her up, input my access codes, and she greets me with, \u201cGood morning, Sirantha Jax. It has been eight days since your last entry.\u201d</p><p>How can the modulated female voice I chose from her option files sound so accusatory? I ignore the small surge of guilt over leaving her out of the loop.</p><p>But I try to placate her nonetheless. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe the week I\u2019ve had. I\u2019ll tell you all about it in a bit, but first, we need your help.\u201d</p><p>She won\u2019t be able to resist that appeal, as it would constitute going against her programming. \u201cHow can I be of assistance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to know everything you do about the Lachion hangar systems.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAccessing,\u201d she responds.</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d Vel sets aside the code scrambler and waits.</p><p>\u201cThe system was designed and installed by Jens Donner, a systems specialist formerly employed by Generation Technologies. After ten years with the company, Donner founded his own enterprise, ZapTech. He is credited with revolutionizing the AI matrix that permits droids to maintain a facility without human direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must\u2019ve included a fail-safe,\u201d I say thoughtfully. \u201cHow do techs get into the system to performance maintenance?\u201d</p><p>After a moment, 245 responds, \u201cI have found the answer to your inquiry in Mair Dahlgren\u2019s partitioned files.\u201d</p><p>Partitioned files? What does that mean?</p> <p>I frown as if she\u2019ll respond to nonverbal cues. \u201cI thought I had access to all data. Why didn\u2019t you mention this before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did not ask.\u201d Such a reasonable reply. \u201cShall I override Mair Dahlgren\u2019s directive, Sirantha Jax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMair Dahlgren reports that entering this numerical sequence, interspersed with gaps of precisely 6.4 seconds, will gain you access to a maintenance submenu from which you may attempt to gain access to primary systems.\u201d</p><p>Jael seems impatient, but if he has any better ideas, he\u2019s free to pursue them. The merc shifts on the balls of his feet and casts a longing glance toward the lounge, as if imagining what the two women might be doing in there without him. Or maybe, like me, he\u2019s fucking starving.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Vel says without looking at him. \u201cI will watch over her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Mary\u2019s sake. We\u2019re in a secure hangar. What exactly do you think is going to happen to me?\u201d</p><p>And then the boarding ramp on the ship begins to unfold.</p> <p>CHAPTER 40</p><p>Jael flicks me a wry look. \u201cYou were saying?\u201d</p><p>I have no fight left in me. No idea what I expect, but I\u2019m braced for the worst when three men come strolling down the ramp. Even though they don\u2019t look alike, the conformity of their garb gives the impression of a resemblance. They\u2019re tall and slim, well coiffed, and their suits look like they cost a year\u2019s pay.</p><p>Not government guys then.</p><p>One of them strides toward us, and the others fall in behind him. That makes him the boss, I guess. On closer inspection, he\u2019s older than his fellows, but he\u2019s had good antiaging treatments. I can see the years in his eyes rather than around them. His gaze roves over me like a shark, and I decide I don\u2019t want to see his teeth. His men tuck their arms behind their backs and wait, as if for orders.</p><p>\u201cOur employer sent us to collect you,\u201d the leader says, as if this is a routine aircab pickup. \u201cHe requires a face-to-face.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t think of anything more eloquent than, \u201cHuh?\u201d so I go with it.</p><p>\u201cWhat employer?\u201d Jael demands. \u201cDo you realize you\u2019re attempting to detain the ambassador of New Terra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d Boss Man replies.</p><p>I glance down at myself. Even my own mother wouldn\u2019t recognize me, covered in Thermud. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The leader glances away from Jael to regard me with puzzlement.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know who I am?\u201d</p><p>He ignores that for the moment. \u201cI believe you\u2019ve already made Mr. Jewel\u2019s acquaintance, Ms. Jax.\u201d</p><p>That doesn\u2019t ring any bells until I notice his intent look, a calm demeanor concealing killer intent. They\u2019re Syndicate, of course. I remember the jeweled brooch my mother wore, what seems like ages ago now.</p><p>Mr. Jewel. Very clever.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell have you done to my mother?\u201d</p><p>I should\u2019ve wondered about that long before now; I\u2019m just not a dutiful daughter, I guess. I take a deep breath, steadying myself as best I can, though fatigue and hunger make it difficult to focus.</p><p>\u201cThat is, in fact, why we were sent to this backwater burg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been waiting for me?\u201d</p><p>That doesn\u2019t track. How could anyone know we\u2019d turn up here? Hell, I didn\u2019t even know if we\u2019d make it out of those tunnels intact.</p><p>The older one inclines his head. \u201cIn a manner of speaking. We\u2019ve been tracking you since you surfaced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTracking?\u201d I hate parroting everything he says, as it makes me sound brain damaged. Then again, it may be better if he underestimates me.</p><p>Behind us, Vel continues his attempts to get into the terminal until one of the goons steps up behind him and shakes his head. Vel sighs and puts away his tools slowly, as if wanting them to see his hands at all times. While they\u2019re watching him, I slip 245 into my pack. It\u2019s just a hunch, but I don\u2019t want them taking her away.</p><p>Given that we\u2019ve disarmed ourselves, there isn\u2019t a lot we can do at the moment. Droids will intervene at the first sign of trouble, but it might be too late if these guys are good enough. And they have that air about them.</p><p>\u201cYour mother was kind enough to slip an isotope into your drink at your last meeting,\u201d the thug explains with a smile. \u201cPerfectly stable and harmless, but it does permit us to monitor your movements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Fugitive scientists once used to track native populations?\u201d I sputter in pure outrage.</p><p>To these assholes, I\u2019m just a blip on a display panel somewhere. Oh, there\u2019s Jax; let\u2019s go scoop her up. If I had a blade in my hand, I\u2019d sink it in his eye right now and fuck the consequences.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly harmless,\u201d he repeats, like it\u2019s a health risk I\u2019m worried about. I guess he\u2019s never had his privacy stolen like this. \u201cI suggest you come aboard, so we can get under way at once. We will convey you safely to your meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou actually believe I\u2019m going with you? Are you out of your mind, or do you think I\u2019m out of mine?\u201d</p><p>One of his thugs takes a step forward as if he doesn\u2019t like my tone, but Boss Man waves him off. \u201cNo, I think you lack viable alternatives, Ms. Jax. You don\u2019t have a vessel. I do. And if you harbored any hope of commandeering it, know this crucial fact. I alone possess the ignition codes, and if they are not entered correctly within three tries, the whole ship goes up.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Jael and Vel, who looks impassive. They offer no suggestions, though I can feel the merc thrumming with tension at my side. He\u2019d like nothing more than to waste these fools, but that might strand us here indefinitely. I suspect he\u2019s no keener than I am to rely on Tarn for our salvation.</p><p>But I\u2019m not sure the Syndicate constitutes a wise substitute.</p><p>Fuck it. When have I ever been sensible? Even if the decision takes us to Mr. Jewel\u2019s private playground, at least we\u2019re off Lachion, right?</p><p>They must have a jumper on board, which means I can rest. I\u2019ll eat choclaste, shoot myself full of the chemical cocktail that\u2019s supposed to mend my bones, and try to ignore the junkie in my head. That voice tells me to jack into grimspace and frag the consequences. I have to ignore junkie Jax if I want to live.</p><p>I\u2019m not entirely sure I do.</p><p>Before, I had March to pull me out of such thinking. I could rely on his warmth, even when I didn\u2019t realize I was doing so. Now it\u2019s just me, falling into the darkness in my own head. That\u2019s a scary place to be.</p><p>This hard man wannabe isn\u2019t as good as he thinks he is. Neither are his boys. Because while I\u2019m thinking things over, Hit slips up behind the boss man and sets a long, filed nail against his throat.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d she whispers against his ear, and her crooning tone raises goose bumps on the back of my neck.</p><p>\u201cSuraya,\u201d Boss Man says without shifting a millimeter. \u201cThe poison pilot. Still doing Madame Kang\u2019s dirty work?\u201d</p><p>I feel like I should know that name, but my mind\u2019s too fuzzy. It slips away like a sleek little fish, back into a jumbled mass of half-formed thoughts and memories.</p><p>\u201cKeller,\u201d she returns. \u201cStill barking on behalf of bigger dogs?\u201d</p><p>He can\u2019t shrug, but it\u2019s implicit in his tone. \u201cIt\u2019s a living. I\u2019d say it\u2019s good to see you, but . . .\u201d His enforcers make an abortive movement, as if to end the impasse, and Keller apparently catches it in his peripheral vision. \u201cNo,\u201d he adds, as Hit strokes her nail down his neck. \u201cDon\u2019t give her a reason.\u201d</p><p>Call me thick, but I don\u2019t entirely understand why he\u2019s so afraid. By the sweat streaking down his now-pasty brow, Keller thinks Hit is the angel of death, standing by his shoulder. Makes me wonder what we don\u2019t know about her.</p><p>\u201cHypo-implant,\u201d Jael whispers. He sounds admiring. \u201cBlack-market ware, costs mad loot. Only the most dedicated killers go for them, ones who prefer quiet jobs, no blood, no mess. The right toxin can even make it look natural, assuming no postmortem lab work.\u201d</p><p>Ah. No wonder Keller\u2019s pissing his pants. Maybe we all should be.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d Hit asks me conversationally. \u201cShould I end him?\u201d</p><p>The goon\u2019s eyes flicker wildly. I can tell he wants to appeal to my better nature, but at this point, I\u2019m not sure I have one.</p><p>Not so smug now, are you, asshole?</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d I say, after a judicious pause. \u201cHe\u2019s our ride off this rock. I wouldn\u2019t mind an apology, though. They\u2019ve been tracking me like a rogue wildebeest. I think that was pretty damn rude.\u201d</p><p>Hit smiles, slow and feral. \u201cThey never did. Why, I\u2019d call that a violation of basic human rights. How can they possibly make that up to you?\u201d</p><p>Somehow I manage to choke back hysterical laughter. Maybe we\u2019ll regret this, but I\u2019m having too much fun to stop. \u201cI\u2019m open to suggestions.\u201d</p><p>To my astonishment, Vel joins the game in dry, scholarly tones. \u201cIf given full access to their ship\u2019s data, I could search for similar infractions and recommend suitable recompense.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d Keller says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, all right? I had nothing to do with that. It was all Jewel. If Suraya will just let me go, we can get under way, all nice and peaceful, and then you can take it up with him in person. That\u2019s a rare honor, you know. He seldom participates in face-to-face meets anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo many people trying to kill him?\u201d Hit asks, butter smooth. \u201cNow, before I step back,\u201d she adds, \u201cI\u2019m going to need your word as a gentleman that there will be no reprisals. I don\u2019t want your boys coming in on me while I sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I want a guarantee of safe passage for me and my crew,\u201d I add.</p><p>\u201cIs your friend sick?\u201d the goon beside Vel asks.</p> <p>I shake my head quickly. \u201cNo. It\u2019s just a skin condition.\u201d</p><p>He really needs to molt.</p><p>\u201cYou have my word,\u201d Keller growls.</p><p>Personally I don\u2019t give two shits for his sworn vow, written in blood, but Hit seemed to want to hear it. In a feline motion, she drops back a few meters. Keller blots the sweat from his forehead with his forearm.</p><p>One of the goons says, \u201cCan I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Keller snaps. \u201cWe have a deal, and we need this truce to hold, unless you want to die in your sleep.\u201d</p><p>Damn, I\u2019m glad Hit\u2019s on our side. If she is. As it stands, I think we need to find out more about this Madame Kang.</p><p>Both his boys mutter, \u201cYes, boss,\u201d as they head back up the ramp.</p><p>\u201cEveryone on board before this Mary-sucking storm grounds us,\u201d Keller adds.</p><p>Well, since he put it that way, we collect Dina and follow as fast as we can.</p><p>CHAPTER 41</p> <p>Their pilot is good.</p><p>Despite adverse atmospheric factors, our departure goes smooth as s-silk. I\u2019ve never been on a ship like this one. Instead of worn fittings, scarred and grimy conduits covered by mismatched panels, and ratty seats, everything looks brand-new. They went the extra mile and outfitted the public areas with a high-quality synth that gleams like mahogany.</p><p>With its burgundy s-leather chairs, the hub looks more like a swanky executive lounge than where the crew straps in for a jump. Even the safety harnesses manage to look decorative. At first I\u2019m afraid to touch anything, and then I realize I don\u2019t care because I\u2019m not paying for it.</p><p>Dina drops down and puts her head back. \u201cI\u2019ll wait here for jump.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m glad, because watching her struggle breaks my heart. We pause by our assigned rooms and drop off our stuff. Then the rest of us continue learning the lay of the land.</p><p>I notice how the light fixtures shine with gilt trim. And droids going about their business have an ultrasleek look, including the cleaning bots. This is a star-class vessel, sold to those with credit ratings I can\u2019t even imagine.</p><p>It\u2019s about time we got a break. I\u2019m not sure this qualifies, but at least it\u2019s a nice ride, and we\u2019re passengers for a change. That implies a certain loss of control over our circumstances, but tired as I am, I\u2019ll take it in trade.</p><p>While the pilot gets out of the atmosphere, Keller gives us a quick tour and introduces us to his boys. The blue-eyed one who wants to kill Hit is named Grubbs. His partner\u2019s name is Boyle. They aren\u2019t in the mood to chat, however, and disappear into the game room, our first stop. Huge wall-screen view panel, four terminals, rigged with virtual sims, and a variety of a comfortable chairs.</p> <p>Keller\u2019s guys mess with the equipment, and then the room reverberates with the distinctive sound of Real Killer. I guess that\u2019s how enforcers relax. When they aren\u2019t cracking heads, they sim it. For a moment I stand in the doorway watching the wall screen mimic the moves they make. That might be fun later.</p><p>Keller clears his throat. \u201cLet me show you the rest.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, I step back, realizing I\u2019m holding up progress. I walk on, only half listening to Keller\u2019s running commentary. Vel comments now and then. So does Jael. But it sounds muzzy to me, faraway and indistinct.</p><p>As we go along, nobody says much, probably eager to clean up and crash. We can\u2019t do that until after jump, though, and we can\u2019t power up the phase drive until we\u2019re away from the planet\u2019s gravitational pull.</p><p>I pause on the observation deck, watching Lachion recede. From this height, it\u2019s a pale world except for splashes of blue where waters lie. March seems both infinitesimal and ephemeral to me now. Touching the ring on my left hand, like a talisman, doesn\u2019t bring him back.</p><p>From this height, it\u2019s like I imagined him. I ache in body and soul. Forgetting the others behind me, I lean my head against the screen for a moment, distorting the image. This isn\u2019t the real Lachion, but an array of light that forms a likeness.</p><p>His kiss, his smile, my frozen tears in the Teresengi Basin\u2014a dozen moments run behind my closed eyelids, fragments of how we were together. And aren\u2019t anymore. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll bear it.</p><p>Vel comes up beside me and puts his hand on my shoulder. Don\u2019t ask me how I know it\u2019s him, but I\u2019ve come to expect this kind of quiet, understated comfort from him. He doesn\u2019t speak, just tilts his head toward the corridor.</p><p>Come away, Jax. There\u2019s a new life waiting for you.</p><p>Maybe he doesn\u2019t mean that, or even think it, but I ascribe those words to him as I suck in a deep breath. My eyes sting, but I blink the tears back. Sometimes giving up the old life is fucking hard.</p><p>I trail the others as we continue the tour. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been on a vessel so big. It must cost the annual per capita income of some small colonies to power it. Game room, observation deck, spa: This ship is like a roving resort.</p><p>I\u2019m definitely coming back to the spa when I get a chance. I\u2019d love a massage, a facial, and anything else I can think of. The droid attendant bears the Pretty Robotics logo, which means she\u2019s top-of-the-line. Even in my nav-star days, I never traveled in such luxury. Since the Corp wanted to maximize profit, they squeezed each credit until it squeaked.</p><p>Huh. Apparently crime does pay.</p><p>Just then, the pilot\u2019s voice comes over the comm. Deep. Masculine. He has an accent I can\u2019t place. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for jump. Strap in, we go in five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far are we traveling?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Jael quirks a brow at me, as if to say, I thought you\u2019d gone mute. Too bad. I flick my fingers at him and turn back to Keller.</p><p>\u201cOne jump and an eighteen-hour haul,\u201d he answers.</p><p>Pity. That doesn\u2019t tell me anything about our destination. We head for the hub, and for the first time in more years than I can count, I don the protective headgear along with everyone else. Envy bubbles in my gut.</p><p>Someone else will make this leap. Another jumper gets to blaze through grimspace and find the beacons. Shit, withdrawal might kill me faster than anything else. My palms feel clammy as I try to strap in.</p><p>I fumble. Hell, how does this even work? I haven\u2019t been a passenger since I was thirteen years old.</p><p>\u201cYou look funny, Jax.\u201d Jael takes the seat next to me. \u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>No. I can\u2019t do the one thing I love more than anything else in the world, unless I want to die. My reassuring smile comes out stiff and scary, if the way the merc recoils offers any clue about my appearance.</p><p>Dina answers for me. \u201cOf course she\u2019s not, jackass. She\u2019s tired, dirty, and she doesn\u2019t know how to put on her harness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he says, oddly gentle. \u201cYou crisscross this, and then this one buckles to the helmet. This last one goes over the top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>I feel helpless. Old. Used up. I never minded the scars on my body, but this . . . I rub my foot over the plush carpet like a sullen child.</p><p>He studies me a moment, his pale eyes eerie in his muddy face. \u201cYou\u2019ve never ridden like this? Not even on vacation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in a really long time.\u201d Twenty years, to be exact.</p><p>He just doesn\u2019t get it. Non-jumpers never do, and there\u2019s a thrill I can\u2019t articulate. But because it might distract me, I try.</p><p>\u201cEveryone has something that makes them special.\u201d I slant him a pointed look to make sure he takes my meaning. Jael gives me a curt nod. \u201cSo imagine if you couldn\u2019t do it anymore. Whether your gift is good or bad, losing it cuts out a large core of what made you unique.\u201d</p><p>Dina cracks, \u201cYour big mouth covers that, Jax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d Jael says, after thinking it over. \u201cBut you\u2019re still you.\u201d</p><p>No, I\u2019m human detritus, what remains when the best burns away. I quash that thought on my own since March isn\u2019t here to do it for me.</p><p>Hit offers the best piece of advice. \u201cJust close your eyes and don\u2019t think about it. Pretend you\u2019re not missing the jump.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll try. Even a ship this size shudders a little when the phase drive comes online. So much energy coursing through the conduits, it couldn\u2019t be otherwise.</p><p>A minute later, Keller arrives with his goons and they strap in across from me. I\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t witness my weakness. I tell myself I\u2019m being a baby, letting the loss hit me so hard. Jumpers retire all the time. They teach. They live otherwise productive lives.</p><p>Why am I determined to make such a big deal out of it? Maybe I\u2019m used to being the hero. I expected us to steal a ship, and me to sacrifice more health because my crew counted on me to jump. Take them to safety.</p><p>Am I disappointed that I don\u2019t get to be a martyr? Shit. I don\u2019t like what that says about me. I don\u2019t have to be the center of attention. I can sit back and ride like everyone else. I can.</p><p>I don\u2019t remember what that first trip was like back when I was a kid. Too many active jumps have nudged that memory aside. So I don\u2019t know what to expect.</p><p>Vel sits on my left. He leans over as much as he can within the harness and says, \u201cYou will experience some pressure, but it is not unpleasant. Electrical sometimes destabilizes while we pass through grimspace, so the lights may go off or flicker uncontrollably.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s trying to make it easier. The raw place inside me eases a little. \u201cAnything else I should know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt helps to hang on to something.\u201d The bounty hunter offers his hand.</p><p>CHAPTER 42</p><p>Smiling, l curl my fingers through his.</p><p>Vel\u2019s hand feels slightly sticky and indefinably wrong. While sight may deceive you, touch rarely does. He\u2019s starting to smell moldy, too. After we jump, I don\u2019t imagine we\u2019ll see him out of quarters until we arrive. I hope that\u2019s long enough for him to generate more skin, unless he intends to go as himself. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a good idea.</p><p>Then again, if Syndicate intelligence is worth anything, they already know about him. So perhaps it\u2019s a moot point. I remember how Jewel said Bugs couldn\u2019t be permitted to mingle freely with humanity. Does he pose a danger to Vel?</p><p>Maybe they\u2019re using me as a blind when they intended to capture the infamous bounty hunter all along. Though I shake my head at the notion, I can\u2019t dismiss it entirely. Good to know my paranoia continues to thrive. It would help if I knew who wanted me dead.</p><p>Lightning streams over my skin. I know when we enter grimspace. Not because the lights flicker, although they do. No, I can feel it in my blood, in my bones. Like I\u2019m part of the primordial matter boiling all around the ship. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I shut my eyes like Hit told me to, I can just about see the colors. Oh, they\u2019re far away, like looking through the wrong end of a telescope, but I can see them. This can\u2019t be a delusion.</p><p>I\u2019ve never heard of anyone who could sense grimspace when they weren\u2019t jacked into the ship, but I\u2019m not imagining this. From the pure, vast silence comes the pulse of the beacons. I hear it as an echo of my own heartbeat. Since I don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going, I can\u2019t attempt to find the right ones, but I sense the navigator in the cockpit doing so.</p><p>He seems sluggish to me, unsure of our course. This jumper lacks my elation, my passion, my certainty. I never doubt I\u2019ve targeted the right beacon, never have trouble translating the star charts from straight space. There\u2019s something wrong here. I\u2019ve never watched anyone work before, though instructors sometimes do. If I had a control button, I\u2019d hit the override.</p><p>I feel the way we alter course, making for a beacon. But he\u2019s overshot the jump. I don\u2019t understand how I know, but this isn\u2019t the place to phase out. Their jumper\u2019s a hack, not an artist; he can barely perceive the beacons at all, and his best guess is our worst nightmare.</p> <p>The phase drive rumbles, preparing to take us back. I shake my head, struggle against my harness, shouting, \u201cNo, no, no!\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s pandemonium. Everyone speaks at once, either telling me to shut the fuck up or trying to reassure me.</p><p>Vel squeezes my hand. \u201cIt is nearly over, Sirantha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit it\u2019s almost over, we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit tight,\u201d the Syndicate pilot barks over the comm. \u201cDo not remove safety gear. This is going to get rough.\u201d</p> <p>Keller depresses a button on the arm of his chair. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem, Mat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve emerged in an asteroid field, sir, two days off target. And these little bastards are surrounded by pockets of highly combustible gas.\u201d</p><p>Oh Mary. I knew it. Well, not about the asteroid field, not exactly, but I knew he\u2019d gotten the jump wrong. I knew it was dangerous.</p><p>But how? How did I know?</p><p>\u201cWhy are you chatting with me then?\u201d Keller demands. \u201cGet us out of this mess and then update me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never realized how good you are.\u201d Because of Dina\u2019s quiet tone, it takes me a moment to register that as a compliment. \u201cHell of a backseat driver, but good. You get us there, time after time. Never anything like this.\u201d</p><p>I shift in my chair. \u201cThat\u2019s not true. When Vel was chasing us, I jumped us eight days out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot into the middle of an asteroid field,\u201d she mutters.</p><p>With a nod, I concede the point. Until now, I never wondered how I avoid jumping back under dangerous conditions. I can\u2019t explain that knowledge; it works like a sixth sense, and I guess I assumed every other jumper has it, too.</p><p>Apparently not.</p><p>The ship tilts this way and that, testing the strength of my harness. We sling hard left and then roll. My stomach lurches as we make a full loop.</p><p>\u201cMary,\u201d Jael groans. \u201cI hope I don\u2019t puke before we die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax.\u201d Keller sounds irritated. \u201cMat\u2019s good. He\u2019ll get us out.\u201d</p> <p>A distant boom and a grinding sound belie his words.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re hit,\u201d the pilot announces. \u201cAnd we have breach. Droids are sealing off the second deck.\u201d</p><p>Damn. Good-bye, spa. Maybe I\u2019d better kiss my ass good-bye while I\u2019m at it.</p><p>\u201cNot good enough.\u201d Hit starts unbuckling her safety gear. \u201cTell him to give me the chair. I\u2019m not dying today.\u201d Another explosion rocks the ship. \u201cGo on, keep waffling, there won\u2019t be enough of this thing left to tell what it was.\u201d</p><p>Keller hesitates only a second before getting on the comm. \u201cMat, I\u2019m sending someone up. Don\u2019t argue, just let her fly.\u201d</p><p>The pilot sounds oddly, inappropriately chipper. \u201cYour funeral.\u201d</p><p>We stare at each other, taut-faced, as Hit sprints down the corridor toward the cockpit. I hope she flies as well as she fights.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s that good?\u201d Dina asks.</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d Coming from someone who hates her as much as Keller seems to, that\u2019s high praise. He sighs. \u201cJewel will have my ass for messing up the new ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpace the guy in the nav chair.\u201d I blurt the words before I think better of them. \u201cHe screwed up so bad\u2014\u201d I trail off, realizing there\u2019s no way I can know that.</p><p>Everyone swivels to look at me, the same question burning in their eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d Keller asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. Forget I said anything.\u201d Why give people another reason to think I\u2019m a crazy egomaniac?</p><p>They don\u2019t look particularly convinced, but a shift in the way the ship handles distracts them. We\u2019ve got Hit in the pilot seat now. The swoops feel faster, more graceful. Smaller explosions trail in our wake, but they don\u2019t touch the ship.</p><p>Maybe we\u2019ll get out of this after all.</p><p>Ten minutes later, she comes strolling down the hall from the cockpit, looking pleased with herself. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how it\u2019s done. Your boys should be able to take it from here.\u201d She smiles at Keller. \u201cAnd if they can\u2019t, I\u2019d have them killed.\u201d</p><p>The Syndicate boss watches as she helps Dina from her chair, and the two of them head off to quarters. Our girl\u2019s moving better already, less drag in her leg, more free movement. Her EMP band must be doing some good.</p><p>I think Grubb speaks for all of us when he says, \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadame Kang\u2019s best,\u201d Boyle agrees with a sigh. \u201cWe should recruit her.\u201d</p><p>Keller shakes his head. \u201cJewel won\u2019t pay what she\u2019s worth. If you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to talk to those idiots in the cockpit. Deck two is off-limits for obvious reasons, but you\u2019re free to freshen up and rest.\u201d</p><p>Rest. Finally.</p><p>I realize I\u2019m still holding Vel\u2019s hand, though I\u2019ve damaged his skin some. \u201cThanks. I\u2019m all right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d His vocalizer somehow grants the words a courtly inflection. \u201cI believe I have some research to do now, if you will pardon me.\u201d</p><p>Warmth floods through me. I need to spend some time with him, find out all about his people, their customs, and how they show affection. If they do. So far, I\u2019ve been lax, and I only know that Ithtorians don\u2019t hug.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Then it\u2019s just Jael and me left in the hub. He helps me untangle myself from my harness, and I haul myself to my feet. My bones pop as I arch my back.</p><p>Uneasy with the intensity of his regard, I try to smile. \u201cWhat a day, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did know, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d I begin a slow progress toward my room, which I hope will be as nice as I imagine.</p><p>\u201cThat the jumper messed things up. Somehow, you went out there with him. You saw . . . something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this,\u201d I tell him tiredly. \u201cI need a shower and then a good eight hours of sleep. Don\u2019t you have anything else to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re not getting out of this so easily, Jax. You may have distracted the others, but I was right beside you. I saw your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d</p><p>The door to my room recognizes me. As it swishes open, I\u2019m tempted to summon a bot to eject him, but that will only delay the inevitable. He\u2019ll never stop once he\u2019s got his teeth into something. I don\u2019t understand why he wants to know so badly, but he\u2019s the stubborn type.</p><p>I pause in the doorway, awestruck. This is mine? All of it? Forget the utilitarian quarters I\u2019ve been used to; this is a suite. As I step onto the thick carpeting, I sink at least a centimeter.</p><p>In my inglorious past, I\u2019ve stayed in hotels that weren\u2019t this nice. I try to take in everything in a single visual sweep, blotting out Jael\u2019s droning voice. Full-sized bed with shimmering blue blanket, a bar, a personal assistance unit with gourmet kitchen-mate. The bathroom steals my breath.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re going to talk about it. As your bodyguard, I have to know every last thing about you and try to figure out a way to compensate for every eventuality.\u201d</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s that simple. Maybe he just wants to be sure that whatever happened isn\u2019t a threat to my well-being. After all, Tarn is paying him to take care of me, and if grimspace poses a danger, even when I\u2019m not jumping\u2014actually I don\u2019t even know the answer. This is all new ground since I\u2019m usually in the nav chair.</p><p>I sigh. \u201cGood luck with that. I\u2019ll be in the shower.\u201d</p><p>With that, I start getting naked.</p><p>CHAPTER 43</p><p>lt\u2019s funny how fast he averts his eyes.</p><p>Not that I blame him. The one good thing you can say about the Thermud caked all over me, it covers my scars. I pad into the bathroom, examining all the different settings. I\u2019m used to a san-shower that just cleans you up. This one promises to unclog your pores, steam off the dead cells, and leave you glowing with health.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see what this thing can do.\u201d</p><p>Midway through my shower, Jael calls, \u201cYou all right in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, why wouldn\u2019t I be? It\u2019s pure bliss.\u201d</p><p>Sound of throat clearing. \u201cNo reason.\u201d</p><p>Half an hour later, I step out and wrap myself up in an ivory robe. I find Jael sprawled on the sofa, drink in hand. But he appears to be . . . blushing?</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I check the tie to make sure I\u2019m not showing skin.</p><p>\u201cHave a good time?\u201d he chokes out. \u201cYou were . . . loud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. It was wonderful.\u201d Just to tease him, I add, \u201cYou did say you\u2019d know the next time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I did.\u201d If anything, his embarrassment intensifies.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe he really thinks I\u2014well, maybe I can use it to my advantage. \u201cYou\u2019d better get used to it since you\u2019re determined to be my shadow. Privacy is overrated anyhow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mad, Jax.\u201d But he smiles.</p><p>Freshly washed, my hair stands on end like down on a baby bird. I grimace at my reflection and head for the kitchen-mate. Jael tracks me with his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou hungry? Don\u2019t think I\u2019ll make a habit of this, but if you go clean up, I\u2019ll make us something to eat. Don\u2019t just sit there. You\u2019re crumbling all over my couch.\u201d</p><p>Maybe I can distract him from the discussion he intends to have. It\u2019s worth a shot anyway. I can\u2019t make him understand what I don\u2019t even get myself.</p><p>Jael slides to his feet. \u201cRight, you\u2019ve persuaded me, but don\u2019t imagine you\u2019re off the hook. We\u2019ll talk about it over dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell we will,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>I half expect him to stride boldly into my bathroom, which offers the interesting dilemma of what he\u2019s going to wear when he\u2019s done. Instead he lets himself out, pausing to murmur, \u201cI\u2019m just next door.\u201d</p><p>As if I\u2019m likely to go into panic mode at the prospect of being alone. Well, it has been a while. Between sharing quarters with Vel and wandering the crowded Gunnar camp, this is certainly a change. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I look over the options on the kitchen-mate and nearly drool. This thing can make anything I want. Thousands of recipes both common and exotic, right at my fingertips, and now I don\u2019t know what I want.</p><p>Tapping away, I just decide to conjure us a feast. Steamed fish and rice in spicy ginger sauce, tissue-thin vegetables arrayed in a fan, and four different desserts. I hope he likes choclaste. This gourmet unit even has real wine in stock; forget the nasty synthetic stuff.</p><p>By the time I get everything laid out, Jael\u2019s back. I make a note to seal my door since it\u2019s apparently coded to admit anyone. He looks better, his freshly washed hair gleaming like molten gold.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019m allergic to fish?\u201d he asks as he joins me at the small table near the kitchen-mate.</p> <p>I grin. \u201cGood thing this isn\u2019t real fish.\u201d</p><p>He knows as well as I do that this is simulated from base organic, but the beauty of a gourmet unit is that you can hardly taste the difference. These days, only the elite know what it\u2019s like to eat fresh fruits and vegetables, and only throwbacks consume real flesh.</p><p>\u201cPoint.\u201d</p><p>When there\u2019s food like this around instead of paste, you won\u2019t find me letting it get cold. I practically inhale mine, down two glasses of wine, and then start eyeing the desserts before Jael cleans his plate. I settle on a rich raspberry-filled truffle and nibble at it while he catches up to me.</p><p>By tacit consent, we shift to the sofa for the conversation he refuses to let slide. I close my eyes and tilt my head back, hoping to elicit sympathy, but this is Jael we\u2019re talking about. Of course it doesn\u2019t work.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d I ask with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened out there?\u201d He touches my cheek, forcing me to look at him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me understand, Jax. If grimspace poses a danger to you, I need to know it. I\u2019m supposed to protect you from all threats, remember?\u201d</p><p>I let out a long breath. \u201cI could . . . feel it. Don\u2019t ask me how. It\u2019s like I\u2019m part of grimspace when I\u2019m not even jacked in. Doc started running tests on me, before . . .\u201d With a weary wave, I gloss over details he already knows. \u201cBut he never came to any conclusions about what makes me different. And now he has a lot of other stuff on his plate.\u201d Massive understatement.</p><p>Both his brows go up, but I don\u2019t glimpse the skepticism I dreaded. Jael doesn\u2019t know the worst of my unstable tendencies, however, so he isn\u2019t likely to dismiss this experience as a \u201cdelusions of grandeur\u201d fantasy. I relax a little.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of anything like that,\u201d he says at last. \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking legend, you know. Still jumping at your age. It\u2019s inspiring.\u201d</p><p>Mary, he makes it sound like I\u2019m a geriatric case, beyond the hope of all antiaging treatments. I grit my teeth. Counting to ten doesn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cWell, you do all right for someone who looks like he ought to be in wet naps,\u201d I tell him sweetly. \u201cDo you shave yet, princess? I bet you couldn\u2019t grow a beard if you wanted one.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s had enough of the wine not to get riled up, more\u2019s the pity. \u201cYou\u2019ve got enough chin hair for both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you were staring so hard at my ass when I went to the shower? Because it hasn\u2019t got any hair on it?\u201d A flip response, not one I expect to make him choke on his drink. \u201cYou were looking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on purpose,\u201d he protests. \u201cOr rather, no more than any man would when confronted with a naked woman. It\u2019s practically against the law not to look. They revoke your man membership if you play the gentleman too often. In a way, I was paying you a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be sure. So you haven\u2019t been guilty of ogling old ladies before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not old in the traditional sense,\u201d he says, tilting his head with a judicious look. \u201cJust for a jumper. You know.\u201d</p> <p>Of course I do. In my first five years on the job, I attended the funerals of fifteen classmates from the academy. After that, I stopped offering to speak at their services. I swallowed my sorrows instead. That\u2019s how my nav-star legend came to be born. Not the party girl they all supposed, or at least, not for the usual reasons.</p><p>Loss seeps out from behind my mental barriers, old wounds, old pain adding to the fresh one, a big jagged hole where March used to be. So many people, gone. What Jael said is true\u2014being the last one standing sometimes does feel like a curse. Just like that, my mood dips to low ebb.</p><p>I need to be horizontal and buried in blankets. A band tightens across my chest, burgeoning into an ache that threatens to close my throat. Mary curse it, if I don\u2019t get him out of here, I\u2019m going to break down right in front of him.</p><p>And I won\u2019t have that.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do, or need to do about what happened out there, Jael. It doesn\u2019t factor into protecting me. Doc figured out why I respond to grimspace damage the way I do, and I know what to do about it. Speaking of which, I\u2019m due for a shot. Unless you just like needles, I suggest you get on your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cDo your thing, but this conversation isn\u2019t over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell it\u2019s not. This is my room! And I don\u2019t want you in it anymore.\u201d I get up from the sofa, and my hands shake as I draw the med kit out of my bag.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure I can manage the treatment without hurting myself. So I close my eyes. That helps a little, though I\u2019m still millimeters away from losing it. The hypo\u2019s preset and automatic, so I just press it against my wrist. A single hiss and it\u2019s done. I push my breath out in what\u2019s meant as a sigh, but it comes out as a groan.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he says, low. \u201cYou pulled a spike out of my gut and saved my life. That might not mean anything to you, but it\u2019s worth something to me. I\u2019m doing my best to be a friend to you, and you act like you\u2019ve never heard of such a thing. A blind man could see you\u2019re hurting, Jax, and I know damn well why. It\u2019s because of who we left behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d My head droops. I can\u2019t look at him as the tears overflow, trickling down my cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m dying of it, and I can\u2019t bring myself to care.\u201d</p><p>He comes to me and touches my cheek, featherlight. \u201cWell, I do.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 44</p><p>l lean toward him, or fall.</p><p>Jael wraps his arms around me, patting in an awkward way that\u2019s meant to be comforting. I can tell he doesn\u2019t know much about the job for which he\u2019s volunteered. If I wasn\u2019t gulping back sobs, I\u2019d laugh at his expression. He leads me toward the sofa while I cry and cry, holding nothing back.</p><p>There are so many things tangled up inside me that I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m weeping. March is part of it, of course, but it\u2019s more than that: an accumulation of woe that I can\u2019t deny anymore. Tears stream freely. My nose starts to run.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you a sight?\u201d he whispers. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I won\u2019t tell anyone what a wet rag you turn into after a couple of drinks. In the vids, they have you up on tables flashing your tits once you down a few rounds, so this is a bit of a shock, innit?\u201d</p><p>I mumble into his shirt, \u201cFuck the vids. They\u2019re all posted by assholes.\u201d</p><p>And then I remember how many members of the gutter press died on Lachion. That probably qualifies as speaking ill of the dead, but I don\u2019t care. I feel his hands on my back, thumping gently. You\u2019d think I was an infant he intended to burp.</p><p>I hiccup.</p><p>The next thing I know, I\u2019m blinking gummy eyes, and I feel stiff all over. Jael is still curled around me, one hand on my shoulder, but he\u2019s out, too. I can\u2019t tell how long we\u2019ve been asleep, but it doesn\u2019t matter. We have two days to rest.</p><p>On this ship, nobody\u2019s trying to kill me, eat me, or otherwise disperse my molecules. That\u2019s a welcome change. I\u2019m still tired, so I stagger toward the huge bed and flop down. Then I sink back into the delicious, gauzy darkness.</p><p>Much later, I surface again, feeling more coherent this time. I adjust my robe, which has gapped in all the wrong places. Rolling out of bed, I assess the situation.</p><p>Poor Jael toppled sidewise on my sofa. He\u2019s going to be sore, and it serves him right for being such a stubborn bastard. I do feel better, but I would\u2019ve cried whether he stayed with me or not. It irks me that he shoved his way into my business, but I\u2019m not furious over it. So I wake him by kicking him in the ankle instead of somewhere worse.</p><p>He squints up at me and groans. \u201cMaybe you\u2019d keep men around longer if you didn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>The joke falls flat, but I pretend it didn\u2019t catch me in a raw place. \u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m not trying to keep you. You have your own room, go to it.\u201d</p><p>Maybe I should thank him, but mostly I\u2019m embarrassed over the way I melted down. I refuse to hash over my emotional state or give him dewy-eyed looks bursting with boundless gratitude. If he craves that sort of thing, he should hit up a girl named Fawn, who dances at the Hidden Rue on Gehenna.</p><p>As he gets up, the door slides open. I turn to see Dina standing there with a wide smile because she\u2019s on her own two feet. But the pleasure in her expression dies like light leaving a dead bulb. Her gaze shifts between the rumpled bed, my dishevelment and Jael\u2019s sleepy good humor.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I was actually starting to like you,\u201d she bites out. \u201cIn your mind, he\u2019s as good as dead. So why not replace him?\u201d She turns so the door closes behind her, leaving her words to accuse me in her stead.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Even if it stings, part of me understands why she made that mental leap. I didn\u2019t grieve years for Kai before falling for March. So maybe Dina thinks that\u2019s the way I operate. One man exits; another man enters, and I just love the one I\u2019m with.</p><p>But it\u2019s not like that. I hope when she cools down I\u2019ll be able to explain, although in the strictest sense, it\u2019s none of her business who sleeps in my room. I\u2019m conscious of Jael standing beside me, looking shocked. But before I deal with him, I code the door so it\u2019s only accessible to me for the duration of the flight.</p><p>He arcs a brow at me. \u201cI guess breakfast\u2019s out of the question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, I\u2019m going.\u201d And he does.</p><p>I dress in black because it suits my mood. At least short hair means I don\u2019t have to style it. Looks the same no matter what I do. I pocket 245, who still hasn\u2019t forgiven me for cutting her off back in the hangar. Maybe this will cheer her up.</p><p>Determined to get some value out of this downtime, I head for Vel\u2019s room. He said he had research to do, but I\u2019m supposed to be tapping him as my resource on Ithtorian culture and customs. To date, I haven\u2019t been taking my role seriously, and no matter what the Syndicate wants, I can\u2019t become another Karl Fitzwilliam. Not even to save my mother\u2019s life.</p><p>Unlike me, Vel was smart enough to secure his room right away. I tap the panel and say, \u201cIt\u2019s Jax. Can I come in?\u201d</p><p>His disembodied voice responds, \u201cA moment please.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>And then the door allows me access. I slip inside. As I expected, Vel has molted, but he isn\u2019t growing any new skin as of yet. I\u2019m not sure whether that\u2019s time related, or if he just doesn\u2019t want to wear it.</p><p>Funny how different people can take the same suite and turn it into something else. Mine has rumpled bedcovers and dirty dishes while Vel has transformed his room into a command center. Scattered devices, wires, and mechanisms make it look as though he\u2019s been here for weeks, not hours.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, Sirantha?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was hoping we could talk about your homeworld. I probably should\u2019ve asked long before now.\u201d I leave it there, choosing not to use the excuses that hover at the tip of my tongue. \u201cBut if I came at a bad time . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can resume my research later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really doing research?\u201d</p><p>That surprises me. I thought he said that to explain his need for solitude. People tend to forgive a lot more eccentricity if they believe the person is of a scholarly bent.</p><p>\u201cYes, actually. I will let you know if I find anything.\u201d</p> <p>Does that mean it relates to me somehow? For once, I don\u2019t let myself become sidetracked. I just nod.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, have a seat.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m more conscious of his vocalizer now because I can see his mandible moving and hear the brief delay before the signals are translated into human speech. I wonder what it\u2019s like for him, functioning as a mimic in our world but never truly part of it. Maybe that\u2019s where I should begin.</p><p>Only the small dining unit isn\u2019t covered with various sensors and monitors, so I sit down there. While I\u2019m at it, I order up some breakfast, or whatever meal this is supposed to be. I\u2019ve completely lost track of time.</p><p>I set 245 on the table, power her up, and input my codes. \u201cOkay if I record?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>By some miracle, she doesn\u2019t chide me for our interrupted session last time, just greets me and gets to work. I wonder if that should worry me. I nibble at a sweetbread while trying to decide how to phrase my opening question.</p><p>Finally, I decide on, \u201cIs it hard for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Duh. He can\u2019t read my mind.</p><p>\u201cYou have to feel really alone sometimes, separated from . . . other Ithtorians.\u201d I barely manage not to say \u201cpeople like you,\u201d which would sound prejudicial, even if I don\u2019t feel that way about him. \u201cHow do you cope with that?\u201d</p><p>Vel sits down across from me, regarding me with glittering, faceted eyes. If I\u2019m learning to gauge his natural expressions at all, I\u2019d say he looks hesitant. \u201cLet me ask a question of you, first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot.\u201d I cram the last of my breakfast into my mouth and immediately wish I had something to wash it down.</p> <p>\u201cDo you find it difficult to look at me as I am?\u201d Vel indicates his current form with one claw.</p><p>Between the claws, mandible, peculiar side-set eyes, chitin shell, and segmented body, there\u2019s no doubt he qualifies as unusual, if not monstrous like the Morgut. While I chew, I consider the question. But if I want honesty from him, I have to give it back. So the answer comes easy.</p><p>\u201cAt first, yeah. But getting to know you took away the strangeness. And now you\u2019re just you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He clicks his claws, a habit I\u2019ve come to identify as pensive. \u201cTo your question . . . we are, by nature, a solitary people,\u201d he says at last. \u201cWe do not form emotional bonds as your species understands them. Our society functions on social obligation, underpinned by self-interest. Temporary alliances may be formed, but not personal attachments. When such an alliance ceases to be profitable or mutually beneficial, the arrangement is terminated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you say alliance, do you mean business or\u2014\u201d But he just said they don\u2019t do personal relationships. I have a hard time wrapping my head around that. \u201cGive me an example. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis could take a while,\u201d he cautions me.</p><p>I smile faintly. \u201cI don\u2019t have anywhere else to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s begin.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 45</p><p>l spend most of the day with Vel.</p><p>Coming from a xenophobic race that possesses the unique ability to pass among other species and chooses not to, the bounty hunter is a walking contradiction. We spent hours talking, and I still don\u2019t have the sense that I know him. Not intimately. I\u2019m not sure whether I can, or if he has the ability to connect as I know it.</p><p>By the time I leave his quarters, my head throbs with all the new information. And I don\u2019t know how I can remember everything, particularly the seven hundred sure ways to offend an Ithtorian. My favorite is clicking the same claw three times in rapid succession.</p><p>They find that gesture especially insulting in casual conversation because it\u2019s how partners signify they\u2019re finished with one another. Really, it\u2019s an impressively rude way to end a conversation. I wonder if snapping my fingers three times would work on people who bore the shit out of me.</p><p>I still don\u2019t entirely understand the hierarchical system Vel laid out for me. I even have diagrams, but they don\u2019t help a lot. Fortunately, 245 promised to go over the entire list with me until I can recite each item by heart.</p><p>Joy.</p><p>\u201cThanks for your help,\u201d I tell her, as we head back down the hall.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here. Have you given any more thought to our discussion, Sirantha Jax?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about, and then it clicks. Back on New Terra, while we were still sequestered, she asked me a favor. \u201cIf we land somewhere I can order the work done, you can pick out a body from Pretty Robotics. Since it\u2019s on Chancellor Tarn, price is no object. Have you thought about a name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am 245,\u201d she says, sounding as puzzled as I\u2019ve ever heard her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but if you want a humanoid body so you can accompany me to official diplomatic functions, you\u2019ll need something else, won\u2019t you?\u201d This was her idea as well, but I see the merit in it. Then she\u2019ll be my personal assistant in every respect\u2014and she\u2019ll be able to signal me if I\u2019m about to make a dangerous breach in etiquette. Her memory will track that better than a human ever could. \u201cBut I guess we could call you according to whatever model you pick out. They have Claudia, Julie, Roberta, Paulette, and I forget who else.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s a Pretty Robotics gimmick since they cater to lonely men who are also fabulously wealthy. If we go this route, 245 will get more attention than the rest of us combined. Maybe that\u2019s a good thing.</p><p>\u201cThis is important?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cI just thought you might want to christen yourself. I mean, how many people get to pick out their own names?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I will consider all the names in my data banks, but I may need your help in a final decision. I don\u2019t wish to select one that is anachronistic or inappropriate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, narrow down to five or ten favorites, and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d</p><p>I turn down the hall that leads back to my room, and a snippet of conversation reaches me from the other end. \u201cDo you think they know?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s Keller\u2019s goons, Grubb and Boyle, but they haven\u2019t seen me yet. I duck around the corner, heart racing.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Boyle says. \u201cKeller\u2019s the best. They think Jewel really wants to talk.\u201d</p><p>Grubb laughs at the very idea, and they pass on by, talking about playing another round of Real Killer. I stand there a moment, wondering at the implications. Whatever this means, I suspect it isn\u2019t good.</p><p>Dammit. We should\u2019ve waited for a Conglomerate ship.</p><p>Once they\u2019ve passed, I sprint down the hall and into my room. Having the door between me and the Syndicate thugs helps some, but it\u2019s not enough. I need everyone in here now, and we need to figure out a plan of action.</p><p>First, I check something for my own peace of mind. I access the terminal, something I should\u2019ve done right away, admittedly, if only I hadn\u2019t been so tired, hungry, and all-around muzzy headed. The workstation powers up readily enough, but when I attempt to access external communications, a big red screen flashes.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry,\u201d it tells me, although it doesn\u2019t sound sorry. Machines never do. \u201cYou are not authorized to transmit to bounce-relay satellites.\u201d</p><p>Shit. We\u2019re officially prisoners then. No access to the outside world. In retrospect, I realize Keller promised us safe passage. He made no guarantees as to what would happen once we arrive.</p><p>I could drive myself crazy wondering whether they\u2019ve decided I outlived my usefulness, but that\u2019s a waste of time. Instead I decide to invite the crew to a \u201cparty\u201d in Dina\u2019s room. I\u2019d hold the meeting here, but I doubt she\u2019d come, given that she wants my head on a pike at the moment.</p><p>I call Vel first. They\u2019re probably logging this conversation, but my paranoia is well documented. In this instance it might even work to my advantage.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a white-noise generator or something that scrambles any snooping devices that might be present?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that certainly qualifies as one of the odder greetings I have received in my life. As it happens, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I say. \u201cBring it with you to Dina\u2019s room, ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>So I ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Another hesitation. \u201cThis is not a good time, Sirantha.\u201d</p><p>Right. Right after I left, he must\u2019ve started fashioning the new skin he\u2019ll wear for the next three days. \u201cWhen would be?\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re both exercising caution now, and I can tell he\u2019s copped to the fact that I\u2019m nervous. I wish I could explain, but that would defeat the purpose. And I suspect he wouldn\u2019t welcome an in-person visit just now.</p><p>\u201cTwo hours. If it is urgent, I could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll let the others know.\u201d</p><p>I spend a few hours pacing and arguing with 245 over why nobody would ever take her seriously as my personal assistant if she takes the name Colette. Her alternatives are worse.</p><p>\u201cDreama? Synara? Those are stripper names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain.\u201d She sounds confused again.</p><p>Four choclaste bars later and six terrible names later, I figure it\u2019s time. By the time I get there, Dina is on the verge of an eruption because her suite is full of people and she doesn\u2019t know why. Her d\u00e9cor looks exactly like mine, but Hit and Jael sit sprawled on her sofa, and Vel is tinkering with some equipment.</p><p>The mechanic glowers at me. \u201cYou want to tell me what the fuck\u2019s going on? Maybe you just wanted witnesses for when I kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>I can tell she\u2019s been putting in hard time with the EMP band and rehab exercises, as she\u2019s visibly stronger today. But I have no intention of brawling. Dina might be able to knock me out one-handed, but she has to catch me first.</p><p>\u201cSave it,\u201d I say with a sigh.</p><p>To simplify matters, I produce 245 and replay the brief conversation between Grubb and Boyle. It\u2019s handy I still had her in record mode from the long session with Vel. I run it twice to make sure everyone has the gist, and then I take a seat well away from Jael. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe lied.\u201d Hit pushes to her feet, slamming a fist into her palm. \u201cI should\u2019ve killed that scumsucker when I had him by the throat. I can take them out if Vel helps me disable droid security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could,\u201d the bounty hunter says. \u201cBut I am not convinced that is the wisest course. If we execute the crew, we are left with a damaged vessel we may not be able to pilot. Keller said only he possesses the ignition codes, so it stands to reason it would require his permission to override the navigational system as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means we continue on course whether we like it or not.\u201d Dina limps over to the kitchen-mate and starts making drinks.</p><p>\u201cAnd when we show up at Jewel\u2019s place with a ship full of dead bodies,\u201d Jael concludes, \u201che really won\u2019t be in the mood to talk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMass murder won\u2019t solve our problems this time,\u201d I say. \u201cHuh. Who knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe jumper\u2019s already dead.\u201d Having dropped that conversational bomb, Hit crosses to the table and helps Dina distribute the cups.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean he\u2019s dead?\u201d Remembering my impulsive words, I have a sinking feeling in my stomach.</p><p>\u201cLast night, I was scouting the place,\u201d she answers without inflection. \u201cAnd saw them spacing the body. I cut out before they made me.\u201d</p><p>Jael seems to read my expression. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Jax. You don\u2019t get a job like Keller\u2019s by being a proper nice guy. He had to show his boss something, prove the failure had been dealt with. Or Jewel might\u2019ve made an example of him. The Syndicate doesn\u2019t make any money off valuing human life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know an awful lot about them,\u201d Dina says, eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat do we know about you, anyway?\u201d</p><p>His pale eyes shine with a cold light, but he masks it with a smile. \u201cI was a merc in Surge\u2019s company, after March\u2019s time. After I got out, I did a turn as an enforcer, yeah, for the Syndicate. I didn\u2019t much like shaking down old ladies for their pensions, so I stopped.\u201d</p><p>Hit raises a brow. \u201cJust like that? You said farewell, and they threw you a little party. Let you walk away?\u201d</p><p>At first I\u2019m not sure why they\u2019re tag teaming him so hard. And then it hits me. Dina wants him to be a bad guy because she thinks I\u2019m sleeping with him. I figure she\u2019s already told Hit her side of things. I open my mouth to defend him, but Jael doesn\u2019t need any help.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answers quietly. \u201cI had to kill a few people to get the message across. I\u2019ve done things I\u2019m not proud of in the name of survival. But I expect that\u2019s the case for everyone in this room.\u201d</p><p>A chill shivers through me at his tone. With the possible exception of Vel, who has more integrity than anyone I\u2019ve ever known, he\u2019s probably right. Silence meets his words, and I think he\u2019s even managed to instill some respect in Dina. She won\u2019t mistake him for just another pretty face again.</p> <p>Jael smiles. \u201cCan we get back to business, or do you have further questions?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 46</p><p>l let the silence build for another moment. Until just now, nobody noticed the steel that braces Jael\u2019s pretty exterior.</p><p>Then I say, \u201cI think that\u2019s a good idea. We don\u2019t want them to catch us flat-footed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis allows us time to plan,\u201d Vel agrees. \u201cWhich is to the good.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s activated the thingie that should jam any snooping devices that might be present. Now he sits beside Jael, hands at his sides. Vel shows a reserve only present in humans who possess some behavioral dysfunction.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still going to see Jewel,\u201d Hit points out. \u201cI don\u2019t see how we\u2019re any better off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we assume they mean you harm, Jax?\u201d Jael asks.</p> <p>\u201cIt stands to reason. They asked me to fuck up my attempts at diplomacy because they don\u2019t want to see interstellar affairs stabilize. Outfits like the Syndicate profit substantially when there\u2019s no central authority to question its activities.\u201d</p><p>I wave away the cup Dina tries to hand me, thinking it might be poisoned, or at least doctored to give me the shits for a good seventy-two hours. Then I get up and pace, back and forth from the door all the way to the bathroom and back again. Something\u2019s niggling at me, but I can\u2019t figure out what.</p><p>\u201cBut Tarn is covering for you,\u201d Jael says after a moment. \u201cHe\u2019s turned our blunders into what looks like heroism on the vids. First we liberate Emry Station, and then we venture into the heart of a war zone, bringing aid? I bet that\u2019s how he spun it. If you continue on your goodwill tour as scheduled, the Ithtorians will be properly impressed by the time you arrive.\u201d</p><p>Dina forgets she\u2019s mad at us for a moment. \u201cSo they need to detain your ass. If you simply disappear, they can leak whatever story they want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think they\u2019ll just kill us?\u201d The pilot furrows her brow like that doesn\u2019t make sense to her.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cIf they wanted me dead, I would be. They caught us off guard in the hangar, and had a clean shot at me before you showed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Vel puts in. \u201cIf they stood to benefit from Sirantha\u2019s death, they would have already arranged it. I cannot imagine that they are prone to wasting resources. If your supposition is correct regarding their motivations, they simply need to hold you long enough to ruin your reputation. Once they let you go, you will not be able to adequately account for your failure, and my people will not be disposed toward permitting any further diplomatic overtures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that so important?\u201d Dina wants to know.</p><p>\u201cWell, for one thing, there\u2019s a prejudicial element to it,\u201d Jael answers. \u201cThey don\u2019t want Bugs passing freely among us because it would become impossible to know \u2018whom to trust.\u2019 No offense, Vel.\u201d</p><p>The bounty hunter lifts a shoulder in an odd half shrug. \u201cNone taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be all of it, though.\u201d Hit shakes her head, brow furrowed.</p><p>I tend to agree. \u201cIf it was just human supremacy rearing its ugly head again, they\u2019d just kill me. And the next ambassador. And the next, until people got the message and stopped taking the job. Groups like the Pure Populist Front don\u2019t operate under the banner of subtlety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint. So what\u2019s the missing link?\u201d Jael doesn\u2019t seem afraid of what\u2019s in the cup, taking a long sip.</p><p>I get tired of pacing and resume my seat on Vel\u2019s other side. He slides me an oblique look, and then says, \u201cThe Morgut.\u201d</p><p>We all shift, eyeing Vel expectantly.</p><p>He goes on without prompting. \u201cI have been researching the increased frequency of Morgut attacks. In the last thirty days, they have targeted twenty remote stations, outposts and/or research facilities. That is a seventy-five percent increase, correlating to one significant event. I posit that Farwan\u2019s fall sent the message that humanity is, at this time, weak and disorganized, thus demarcating you as ideal prey. You also possess the side benefit of being delicious.\u201d</p><p>Was that a joke, albeit a dark and twisted one? I grin in appreciation.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why the Conglomerate is desperate to get the Ithtorians on board. Tarn will do anything to make it happen.\u201d Dina slaps her good knee in realization. \u201cMy politics are rusty, but this makes perfect sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnlighten the rest of us,\u201d Hit says with a wry smile.</p><p>I lean forward as Dina explains, \u201cFrom what you told me about your encounter with the Morgut on Emry, Vel was the only one they feared. He\u2019s Ithtorian, not human, and that makes him a hunter, not prey. He speaks their language, therefore he\u2019s considered an equal. If the Ithtorians side with humanity in the burgeoning conflict, that will give the Morgut pause, hopefully preventing an escalation to all-out interstellar war, the like of which we haven\u2019t seen since\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Axis Wars,\u201d Jael finishes flatly.</p><p>Shit. For a moment I just sit there, numb, and hellaciously impressed by Dina\u2019s insight. She\u2019s damn smart beneath her gruff fa\u00e7ade. Then again, I keep forgetting that at one time, she used to be royalty, schooled to see nuances like this.</p><p>Vel nods. \u201cI concur with that assessment. As before, however, you fail to address the most crucial question.\u201d</p><p>Thinking isn\u2019t my strong suit, so it\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m surrounded by geniuses. \u201cWhat would that be?\u201d</p><p>Jael supplies it. \u201cWhat does the Syndicate stand to gain by promoting a war between humanity and the Morgut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey sell weapons,\u201d Hit answers at once. \u201cIncreased revenues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a rhetorical question,\u201d the merc grumbles. \u201cI know that. They also hire out as enforcers, which means they could stand to gain a lot in security contracts. Merchant ships in need of protection, special forces hired to guard remote outposts.\u201d</p><p>Dina nods. \u201cThe possibilities are limitless. If they play it right, they could step into the void left by the Corp and edge out the Conglomerate entirely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut to achieve that,\u201d Vel continues, \u201cthey need to discredit Sirantha, not execute her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ve been kidnapped.\u201d</p><p>My mouth tightens. I have no doubt we\u2019d have figured it out sooner or later, but surely this helps. Instead of taking things at face value, we\u2019re going to be looking for a way out from the jump. We\u2019ll find a way; we always do.</p><p>\u201cI theorize that Jewel intends to keep Sirantha out of trouble until Tarn has no hope of putting a positive spin on her absence,\u201d Vel adds.</p><p>\u201cIn other words, the Syndicate thinks I\u2019ll make a fine scapegoat. That sounds familiar. Given my track record, I get to be the worst ambassador ever, possibly rivaling Karl Fitzwilliam.\u201d</p><p>I decide to risk Dina\u2019s hospitality after all, but I program my own drink, just in case. Mmm, hot choclaste makes everything better. Even hearing that you\u2019ll be credited with precipitating the worst conflict since the Axis Wars.</p><p>\u201cDepends on how badly the war goes with the Morgut, but yes.\u201d Vel finally shifts, steepling his hands together. If he wasn\u2019t wearing the faux skin, I have no doubt he would be clicking away as a sign of deep thought.</p><p>Jael pushes to his feet. \u201cWe\u2019d better disperse before they come to find out why we\u2019re meeting in secret. I mean, we can assume they know we know something, and they can try to guess what we know, but nobody really knows what anybody else knows, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you do that again, I will kill you.\u201d Hit glares at him. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding.\u201d</p><p>Yep, there\u2019s a reason she gets on so well with Dina. Not sure where that relationship is heading, and it\u2019s not my business. But it\u2019s good to see Her Highness smiling again, whatever the reason.</p><p>Crap. I just ordered this drink. With a mental shrug, I drain it in one gulp. It\u2019s meant to be sipped, not slurped, but I\u2019ll be damned if I let it go to waste.</p><p>Nobody\u2019s surprised when Hit opts to stay, but I let the guys file out first. I pause at the door. \u201cLook, it\u2019s not what you think. He\u2019s just overzealous, that\u2019s all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To my surprise, Dina flashes me a sheepish smile. \u201cYeah, Hit talked me out of that. She said she can always tell when somebody\u2019s getting down, and you haven\u2019t had any since we left Lachion.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows feel like they\u2019re shooting off the top of my head. \u201cShe can do what now? How?\u201d</p><p>Hit smiles. \u201cIf I told you that, I\u2019d have to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d I mutter. \u201cLike I haven\u2019t heard that line a thousand times. It was old when your great-grandmamma was young.\u201d</p> <p>In the pilot\u2019s case, however, it just might be true. I opt not to stick around long enough to find out. I have work to do.</p><p>CHAPTER 47</p><p>We\u2019re on Venice Minor.</p><p>Kai and I vacationed here once, four years ago. There\u2019s a unique brilliance in the sunshine, and the quality of the air possesses an indefinable sweetness. It actually soothes the lungs as you draw it in, soft and balmy. Back then, I laughingly called it paradise, but today it\u2019s my prison, however prettily they package it.</p><p>And let me say, it\u2019s a fabulous villa, all shimmering white stone designed in faux-classical style. Spacious grounds with seven open gardens and terraces invite you to take a stroll; tiered balconies overflow with miniature fruit trees. Yes, you can pluck grapes right off the vine and peaches from the bough. Sweetness drizzles from your lips down your chin.</p> <p>Though Keller and his goons refuse to confirm, I know perfectly well where we are. And the first time I get access to an unsecured terminal, I\u2019ll bounce a message so that the whole world knows, too. They\u2019re not blaming this on me; I refuse to be held responsible for increased Morgut attacks and diplomatic failure on Ithiss-Tor.</p><p>Maybe I took my role lightly at first, but our time on Emry, and later, on Lachion, put me ass deep in human suffering. I won\u2019t stand aside. I won\u2019t let the Syndicate neutralize me with promises of future meetings and astonishing opulence.</p><p>Keller assigned us lavish suites that actually manage to dim the luxury we enjoyed while aboard the ship. I refuse to be distracted by promises of steam baths, pure-earth facials, and deep-tissue massages, however. I pace my gilt-and-ivory cell, feverish with the need to act.</p><p>Everything is coded. It practically requires Keller\u2019s permission to take a bath. He plays the role of host quite convincingly. If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d almost believe him when he says, \u201cMr. Jewel has been called away unexpectedly, but he wishes you all to avail yourself of his hospitality in the meantime.\u201d</p><p>Bullshit.</p><p>I\u2019m starting to wonder if this Mr. Jewel even exists. He might be Keller for all I know. The voice that spoke through my mother\u2019s voice was distorted enough that I wouldn\u2019t recognize it if I heard it without augmentation.</p> <p>The first day, I amuse myself playing with the ridiculously sophisticated wardrober that came with my room. The Fashionista 4000 has patterns and styles that I\u2019ve never seen before. By the time I\u2019m finished, I\u2019ve come a long way toward replenishing all the clothes I\u2019ve seen lost or destroyed along the way.</p><p>In some of them, I might even look like an ambassador, although Dina refuses to watch me try on outfits and give me her opinion. Too bad, since she\u2019s the only one of us with any experience in such matters. But maybe I shouldn\u2019t have asked because she wears a queer look when she shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all behind me,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cI\u2019m a mechanic now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d I turn from the mirror, clad in a filmy scarlet dress that gives me the look of a fetish vid star not afraid to show some skin. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go see what Hit\u2019s up to.\u201d The way she leaves makes me sure I\u2019ve struck a sore spot.</p><p>Damn, I hate when I\u2019m an insensitive asshole. Usually I can see it coming, but this one blindsided me. Now that I\u2019m thinking about it, I can imagine Dina sitting in her sister\u2019s rooms, watching them try on clothes, talking about the parties they\u2019ll attend. Maybe the coup on Tarnus took place twenty years ago, but she still wears the scars. Hers just go further than skin deep.</p><p>With a sigh, I peel off the red gown and don something more sensible: skinny white slacks, white vest, and light woven shoes. While checking to make sure I got the sizing right on the new clothes, I notice that my dark hair\u2019s almost three centimeters long now, and it\u2019s starting to curl. I\u2019m finally losing the lost-refugee look.</p><p>With a shrug, I close the closet door. Most times, when I look at my reflection, I see the scars to the exclusion of all else. They remind me of the people who died for the Corp\u2019s greed; I carry their shadows in my skin.</p> <p>If I\u2019m a walking memorial, my life has to mean something. I never used to think along those lines. Never saw patterns or purpose\u2014I think that\u2019s March\u2019s influence. I force back the mood shift that threatens at the thought of him. No time for that. I\u2019ll yearn or grieve, or whatever the right emotion is, later. For now I\u2019ll do some poking around; see what I can find out.</p><p>Mary, I can\u2019t believe I have to put my faith in a politician like Tarn. Now that I understand his angle\u2014and what he\u2019s trying to prevent\u2014it scares the shit out of me. I hope he can come up with an explanation for where I am this time. I\u2019m supposed to be on Ielos, inspiring the pioneers that eke out an existence on the winter world.</p><p>He must think I\u2019m the biggest fuckup in the world. When we win free, I\u2019m going to take this job seriously. I can do this. I can be more than Jax the jumper. I\u2019ve already memorized half the list that Vel went over with me. Morning to night, 245 drills me mercilessly, and it\u2019s not like I have anything else to do.</p><p>Hit would like to slaughter everyone on the estate and steal a ship. But then she tends to solve all problems with a closed fist, which explains why she and Dina get on so well. Fortunately, cooler heads have prevailed so far, and we\u2019re doing recon, trying to find out how many men are at this place, what types of ships are docked here, and what security we can expect\u2014Vel\u2019s forte.</p><p>I hate relying on Vel, but my options are limited. Realizing I\u2019m pacing, I wheel as I come up against the glastique door that bars me from the terrace. I could key it open, as Keller kindly gave me security codes\u2014but it wouldn\u2019t help in the grand scheme of things. We\u2019re prohibited from wandering off estate grounds\u2014\u201cfor your own safety,\u201d as Keller put it\u2014and there\u2019s a shock field around the perimeter to protect us from marauding native animals, since the undeveloped portions of Venice Minor consist of wild jungle and dense rain forest.</p><p>Well, I have to do something. In the last two days, the only thing I\u2019ve achieved is a light tan. While I no longer look so sick or pasty\u2014and daily injections seem to be shoring up my rickety bones\u2014I need to accomplish something substantial. The past months, I\u2019ve felt like deadweight that just slows people down.</p><p>As I\u2019m getting ready to head out, the door bot tells me, \u201cYou have a visitor, Sirantha Jax. Allow entry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d I\u2019ve learned something since March walked into my cell on Perlas Station. I always ask the caller\u2019s ID now.</p><p>After a brief pause, the bot answers, \u201cVel.\u201d</p><p>I find that oddly charming. The bounty hunter doesn\u2019t use nicknames or terms of endearment, but he\u2019s adopted my mode of address for him? From what he\u2019s said, his people don\u2019t adopt new customs easily, which makes their ability to mimic alternate forms all the more intriguing.</p><p>Most Ithtorians would consider the way Vel lives vulgar. There\u2019s a certain stigma attached to concealing his true appearance. The ability developed as a trait meant to enhance hunting prowess, not to allow an Ithtorian, who is clearly superior, to pass among the soft skins.</p><p>\u201cLet him in.\u201d</p><p>The door swishes open, and Vel steps inside. He\u2019s getting better at smiling in greeting, simulating the type of expression that people wear when they\u2019re happy to see someone. I smile back because whenever he\u2019s around, I feel steadier.</p><p>\u201cThey gave you the princess room.\u201d He takes in the elevated bed with its elaborate netting, and the furniture that shimmers with gold.</p><p>I arch a brow. \u201cI figured everyone\u2019s room looked like this, which must make you boys feel less than manly.\u201d</p><p>He radiates puzzlement, though his face doesn\u2019t alter noticeably. \u201cHow could a color scheme affect my gender?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d Sometimes I forget that while Vel might be masculine, he is definitely not a man. \u201cWhat\u2019s your room like then?\u201d</p><p>I figure he\u2019ll get around to the reason behind his visit, and it doesn\u2019t hurt to be social. I could use the practice since the Ithtorians will be judging my manners.</p><p>\u201cIt is green,\u201d he says.</p><p>Well, that doesn\u2019t tell me much. Thankfully, it doesn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cYou want something to eat or drink? I have a full gourmet kitchen-mate in here. And there\u2019s a peach tree on my balcony.\u201d I must admit, playing the hostess doesn\u2019t come natural to me. I\u2019m ready to demand what he found out, which doesn\u2019t bode well for my aptitude for political maneuvering.</p><p>\u201cIf it contains citric acid, I will become ill. Thus, I must decline.\u201d</p><p>At this point, I give up. I can practice the art of patience later. \u201cHave you finished with your recon? What can you tell me?\u201d</p><p>He takes a seat on the long, soft white sofa. \u201cI have. I took a look around the compound, examined security measures, and listened to Grubb and Boyle for an extended period of time. When they were otherwise occupied, I managed to access one of their personal communication units and I downloaded all relevant data. After lengthy analysis, I believe I have detected a fault in their security that can be exploited. But it will require complex planning and some sleight of hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVel,\u201d I breathe. I somehow manage to control the urge to hug him around the neck. \u201cI knew you\u2019d come through. Tell me what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will take everyone, operating in tandem, to make this work,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I believe I\u2019ve located an old terminal in the sublevel of the structure. It has been decommissioned, but if you take Dina with you, you should be able to patch back into the system. I don\u2019t believe such a task would surpass her capabilities.\u201d</p><p>Given that I\u2019ve seen her repair a ship with glue, copper wire, and pure voodoo, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s right. \u201cOkay, what will the rest of you be doing?\u201d</p><p>He tells me.</p><p>CHAPTER 48</p><p>\u201cYou sure Jael and Hit can pull this off?\u201d Dina mutters.</p><p>She has some reason to worry. We laid out a three-prong plan, and if anything goes wrong, we\u2019ll be in the soup for sure. Timing is crucial. It\u2019s a good thing we learned to rely on each other in the tunnels; otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t have dared risk something on this scale.</p><p>We\u2019re down in the basement, not somewhere we should be wandering. I doubt we could convince anyone we\u2019re sightseeing. This will work, though. It has to.</p><p>I cock a brow at her. \u201cDo you think we\u2019re better qualified to take out targets quickly and quietly?\u201d</p><p>Dina responds with a withering look. \u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot. You have the schematics?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After a few uninterrupted days of exercise and EMP stimulation, she\u2019s walking so much better that it takes me a minute to understand why she\u2019s so touchy. I\u2019d never know she had a transplant such a short time ago. Her limp isn\u2019t even debilitating now; it just throws off her gait some. Doc did a good job picking the replacement limb. Wisely, I decide not to mention any of those thoughts.</p><p>\u201cRight here.\u201d I loft 245, who doesn\u2019t say anything. But she\u2019s powered up, ready to play her role.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if this is genius or desperation, but if I had to guess, I\u2019d call it a reckless marriage of the two. The tricky part arises from not being able to check the others\u2019 status, because our comms can\u2019t connect to the wireless system. Or rather, aren\u2019t being permitted to do so. We\u2019re welcome to use their terminals for room-to-room calls, of course.</p><p>Yeah, right.</p> <p>\u201cIf Vel does his part on time, we\u2019ll get in and out in less than two minutes.\u201d</p><p>The alternative goes unspoken. If he doesn\u2019t, alarms sound, Keller\u2019s goons come running, and\u2014well, I\u2019m not sure what comes next, but I\u2019d guess it\u2019s not good. I imagine there\u2019s a limit to what they\u2019re willing to put up with. They could transfer me to an altogether-less-agreeable prison, or if they lose patience with the babysitting job entirely, they might off me. As Jael pointed out, these guys don\u2019t make money off valuing human life.</p><p>As we pause outside the door, I scan the hallway, take a deep breath, and then activate 245. \u201cJohann Keller, requesting access.\u201d</p><p>She can reproduce a voice with a 98.5 percent accuracy. Let\u2019s see if that gets us in the door. Vel should\u2019ve patched into the cameras by now, so if anyone\u2019s watching, it looks like we\u2019re not here.</p><p>\u201cGranted,\u201d the bot tells us politely.</p> <p>We hasten into the room before something can go wrong, and the door slides closed behind us. I draw up short, causing Dina to slam into my back. Her weight makes me oof, and I nearly drop 245, who responds with a cautionary, \u201cBe careful, Sirantha Jax. In your current financial state, you cannot afford to replace me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t replace you even if I had a trillion credits,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>Dina ignores us as she scowls at where we\u2019ve ended up. Droid parts litter the filthy counters, and a half dozen broken units lean up against the wall\u2014chassis, arms, legs, even heads. Something stands in the far corner, covered by a tarp. No terminals, not even the decommed one Vel\u2019s schematics reflected.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll find anything useful in here.\u201d</p><p>The mechanic looks like she wants to slap me. \u201cNo shit. They must\u2019ve made some changes since those plans were uploaded.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr they planted the wrong ones on purpose.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t put it past them.</p><p>Nothing like running us around for entertainment. It saves them worrying that we might actually accomplish something. Keeps us busy until the elusive Mr. Jewel sees fit to turn up and deal with us.</p><p>Well, I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll wait. There has to be something we can use. I start to rummage quickly, not knowing whether there are cameras in here. I can\u2019t spot any of the usual tells, but the room is dark and grimy with months of accumulated dust. Whoever used to tinker down here doesn\u2019t anymore.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d Dina wants to know. \u201cThis is a complete waste of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d I yank the cover off the thing in the corner and only just manage not to stagger back in shock.</p><p>Her eyes widen, just as mine do. \u201cWell, maybe not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>She comes over to examine what I\u2019ve found. At first I thought it was a dead body, but the flesh feels smooth and supple when I poke it. For all intents, we\u2019ve found a woman down in storage, eyes closed as if in repose. She has brown hair and an aesthetically perfect face that comes from a composite of many beautiful people.</p> <p>Bracing herself on the wall, Dina bends and lifts its bare foot. \u201cShe\u2019s a Lila, one of Pretty Robotics\u2019s older models. See the logo stamped on her insole? They changed the line about five years ago and shifted away from classical beauty, went more for the lush, showy designs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBigger boobs?\u201d I guess.</p><p>\u201cAmong other assets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she broken?\u201d Why else would she have been dumped down here?</p><p>\u201cLemme take a look.\u201d</p><p>She pops a panel on the droid\u2019s forearm, taps a few buttons, but nothing happens. \u201cLooks like her chip is fried. Expensive repair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless . . .\u201d I look at 245, hold her up beside the Lila. \u201cWhat do you think? She\u2019s been asking for a way to join the action. Could you manage a brain transplant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my forte, but maybe. I have a knack with most machines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help,\u201d 245 volunteers. \u201cOnce you begin the process, I can tell you what connections remain to be made and what systems I am able to control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try it,\u201d Dina decides. \u201cThis unit may have security clearances that 245 can exploit. That alone makes it worth tackling. Plus I like a challenge. Jax, find me some tools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I barely manage not to salute and call her \u201cYour Highness\u201d just to rag on her. After what happened earlier, I\u2019d rather not test Dina\u2019s mood, particularly not when my very helpful, damn-near-indispensable personal assistant depends on her good offices.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be a quick in and out,\u201d she warns me. \u201cIn the original plan, Vel only gives us ten minutes to bounce a message out, telling Tarn where we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s hope the third prong works without a hitch. If Jael and Hit take care of the goons for us, maybe nobody will come looking.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cAnd maybe this room isn\u2019t on camera. We can\u2019t worry about it now. The die is cast. Hand me the silver one. No, smaller than that.\u201d</p><p>I feel like a particularly inept medical assistant, but I pass her the implement as she begins the procedure. Dina actually unscrews the top of the droid\u2019s skull, lifting it off, hair and all. Disembodied, the mass of shimmering chestnut hair looks macabre on the dirty table.</p><p>I look away in time to find Dina another tool, this one with a curved end. The model\u2019s head is empty; they\u2019ve already scrapped the ruined bits apparently. To my untrained eye, it looks as if she could just set 245 in there. The space inside the droid\u2019s skull seems perfectly sized to accommodate my PA.</p><p>She confirms that with an astonished murmur. \u201cI had no idea the pleasure models could be adapted for business so easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you will need to remove my external casing,\u201d 245 tells us. \u201cIf you were not present, Sirantha Jax, and your correct security codes active, such a procedure would destroy me, along with everything in my data banks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s safe now? Because I\u2019m here, and I\u2019ve . . . authorized the installation?\u201d I\u2019m not sure what else to call it.</p><p>\u201cIt should be.\u201d But she sounds unsure. \u201cThere are risks associated with exposing my inner workings, but they should be minimized if I am swiftly housed in my new casing.\u201d</p><p>Heh. Only 245 would call this slim, perfect body a casing . I wonder how she\u2019ll deal with men hitting on her. And they certainly will.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s get it done before we\u2019re interrupted.\u201d Dina takes 245 from my hands, and damn if I don\u2019t feel like an anxious parent. \u201cHow do I get you open? I don\u2019t see any seams.\u201d</p><p>That strikes me weird, too, akin to asking a patient to consult on her own surgery. However, 245 responds with aplomb. \u201cI will raise the temperature of the two spots on either side where you must apply pressure.\u201d</p><p>Dina closes her eyes, running her fingertips along the sides of the sphere. \u201cGot it. Here and here.\u201d</p><p>And 245 pops into segments with tiny silver screws showing. \u201cThat is correct. Be sure to ground yourself before touching any of my sensitive components.\u201d</p><p>I feel myself start to sweat. It trickles down my neck to the small of my back. \u201cYou sure you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>The mechanic glares. \u201cWill you shut up? You\u2019re making me nervous. And I need a steady hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not worry,\u201d the PA reassures me. \u201cAll will be well, Sirantha Jax. But perhaps you should permit us some room to work.\u201d</p><p>And stop watching, I add silently.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ll be over here if you need me. Guarding the door. Or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Dina\u2019s already lost interest in my angst, getting straight to work.</p><p>I turn my back, hoping for the best.</p><p>CHAPTER 49</p><p>The operation is a success.</p><p>For a moment, I just watch 245 taking her first steps. Her movements are jerky and unsure, but she\u2019s doing it. The way she moves her head strikes me as unnatural, too, scanning rather than looking, but at least she\u2019s ambulatory. I\u2019m so proud.</p><p>\u201cThis is very interesting,\u201d she says in the voice I chose for her.</p><p>\u201cGreat job, Dina.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs like it\u2019s no big deal, but I can see that she wants to smile. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t too bad once you left me alone. We should get out of here, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. Shall we, 245?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have given that a considerable amount of thought,\u201d she tells me. \u201cAnd I believe a numeric designation is no longer appropriate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you pick?\u201d I fiddle with the controls, but I can\u2019t get the door open.</p><p>\u201cConstance,\u201d she answers. \u201cIt means constant or steadfast. I will take the surname Riddle because of my nature.\u201d</p><p>I like it, actually, not that my approval is paramount. \u201cGood choice. Can you get us out of here, Constance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me try.\u201d She pauses, head tilted. \u201cThis unit possesses basic clearances. Let\u2019s see if these codes still work.\u201d</p><p>They do, and the door slides open. We step out into the dark hallway, so different from the ivory elegance of the upper stories. Keller comes around a corner and heads right for us.</p><p>Too late to run. My heart races. By his expression, he isn\u2019t sure what we\u2019re doing down here. Well, that makes two of us. I hope 245, er, Constance keeps quiet. If she speaks, he\u2019s going to know she isn\u2019t programmed to simulate sexual arousal.</p><p>\u201cThat unit is broken,\u201d he says by way of greeting. \u201cThe boys got a little rough with her one night.\u201d</p><p>Ew. It explains why she was in storage, though. \u201cDina repaired her,\u201d I answer, trying to project the old Jax, the party girl people saw on the vids. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty quiet around here. So we\u2019re going to have a little party. You want to come?\u201d</p><p>Keller seems undecided. My skin crawls. If he says yes, we\u2019ll have to kill him. It won\u2019t be as quick and elegant as Hit could manage, but we\u2019ll get the job done.</p><p>Making matters worse, I\u2019ll have to play the femme fatale. Dina doesn\u2019t have the hetero skill set, and Constance can\u2019t pass as a pleasure droid. I try on what I hope is a flirtatious smile, and run my fingertips down the front of his shirt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He steps back. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t mix business with pleasure. I need to find Grubb and Boyle. But don\u2019t let me get in the way of your good time.\u201d</p><p>Thank Mary, he\u2019s going to let us take the bot without questioning the repair. If he knew anything about the damage to this model, he\u2019d realize there was no way to fix her without a new personality chip. We brush past him, heading for the lift, but my pulse doesn\u2019t slow until we put a floor between us.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to find Grubb and Boyle, is he?\u201d I need a minute to figure out our next move.</p><p>We should\u2019ve gotten a message out by now, and apart from having found a body for 245, which wasn\u2019t exactly urgent, we\u2019re no better off. I lead the way down the hall, away from this part of the house at least. The other two follow.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. We didn\u2019t send a kind, gentle team to take care of them, did we?

Hearing 245\u2019s voice come out of this gorgeous woman gives me a little start. \u201cThat signifies excitement, nervousness, or anxiety, does it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could tell that?\u201d I realize I have no idea what this Pretty Robotics model is capable of. I always preferred my companions with a pulse.</p><p>\u201cI am able to monitor physiological reactions,\u201d she confirms. \u201cPulse, respiration, body temperature. I believe my predecessor may have used it to gauge reactions to her overtures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut with some adaptation, you could use it as a lie detector,\u201d Dina says. \u201cThat could come in handy.\u201d</p><p>In my role as ambassador, assuming I ever get there, it would prove invaluable. Constance apparently agrees because she answers, \u201cI need more data regarding the normal spectrum for nonhumans, but yes. I could utilize my sensors in that manner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy secret weapon,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cWill I be a secret?\u201d the droid asks. \u201cDo you plan to pass me as human?\u201d</p><p>I haven\u2019t begun to think of that, or the ethical pitfalls involved. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Is that legal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can check my data banks.\u201d</p><p>Dina shakes her head at both of us. \u201cStay focused, please. You can worry about the AI precedents later.\u201d</p><p>As we move, the villa seems ominously silent. But if Vel, Jael, and Hit have done their jobs well, the place might well be devoid of life, except for us. I haven\u2019t heard the report of weapons, nothing but the soft rasp of our shoes against the patterned tile floor.</p><p>Time runs against us. Every minute I spend here and not on Ielos works against us. Tarn\u2019s excuses won\u2019t hold forever.</p><p>\u201cWe need to expedite an escape, do we not?\u201d Constance must\u2019ve been running the problem over from various angles.</p><p>I nod. \u201cThat\u2019s the idea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps my basic clearances will work on a communication terminal,\u201d Constance suggests. \u201cThey may not have blocked them because prior to my installation, this unit would never have possessed the impetus to use such a device.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her for a moment. \u201cThat\u2019s an astonishingly simple yet brilliant idea. Your room is closest,\u201d I add to Dina. \u201cLet\u2019s see if this\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>The mechanic\u2019s room is quite unlike mine, more masculine, done in mahogany and gold. Our quarters share certain amenities, however, such as the spacious floor plan and luxurious appointments. Her bed doesn\u2019t have the intricate netting, however, or the fanciful carvings on the head-board.</p><p>Constance heads for the terminal and keys in her codes. We share a tense moment, and then she glances at me, as if in search of approval. I step up behind her in time to see the screen flash to a new set of options.</p><p>\u201cSecurity for the whole house uses the same central computer, which accepts the same algorithmic sequences,\u201d she explains.</p><p>\u201cSo what works for the doors also works on the terminals.\u201d Being mechanically minded, Dina figures it out much faster. \u201cDon\u2019t just sit there, bounce a message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have Chancellor Tarn\u2019s node address, but I require content.\u201d</p><p>With her looking like a vid actress, it\u2019s harder to remember how literal she can be. \u201cTell him we\u2019re being held on Venice Minor by the Syndicate, and we need help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you attach a worm to the message so he can trace the message to its origin?\u201d Dina asks. \u201cThat\u2019ll help him find us faster. And bury it in the subsystem logs if you can, so it\u2019s not immediately noticeable if someone is monitoring communications.\u201d</p><p>For several tense, nerve-wracking moments, we watch her work the terminal with all the care of a tightrope dancer. She\u2019s clumsy with her fingers at first, unused to such an imperfect interface. And then columns of symbols and numbers pour down the display panel, green tinged, yellow tinged.</p><p>So far so good.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, and done,\u201d Constance tells us at last. \u201cAfter sending it, I altered the time stamp to conceal it from prying eyes. If there is no secondary screening system, our message should reach the Chancellor within twelve hours.\u201d</p><p>Twelve hours. But we don\u2019t know how long it\u2019ll take to get somebody out here. Maybe we shouldn\u2019t count on him. But maybe he can spin things with the truth. I can see the talking heads now: The New Terran ambassador has been kidnapped. No ransom demands have been received as yet . . .</p><p>The timing of the door chime makes me jump, and Dina looks edgy as a chem-head in search of her next fix. I look around for a weapon. Find nothing. They confiscated all our hardware before we boarded, and we haven\u2019t seen any of it since. Jaw clenched, I take up a heavy bronze statuette on a side table while Dina takes up position on the other side of the door, beside the control panel.</p><p>I nod. It\u2019s her room.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d That\u2019s classic Dina right there, down to the irascible tone.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Hit asks. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Dina answers, unlocking the door.</p><p>The tension drains out of me as Dina lets the pilot in. Jael strolls in behind her, but he draws up short when he catches sight of Constance, now sitting on the sofa. Well away from the terminal. Smart.</p><p>This should be fun.</p><p>\u201cWell then. I had no idea you\u2019d made such a charming friend, or I\u2019d have been back long before now. How\u2019d things go by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got the job done,\u201d Dina answers briefly. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>Jael smiles. \u201cUs, too.\u201d</p><p>My gaze fixes on a small splotch of blood on the collar of his pale blue shirt.</p><p>Though they don\u2019t tell us where they hid the bodies, the Syndicate is down five hired thugs.</p><p>CHAPTER 50</p><p>We\u2019re deep in strategy sessions of phase two.</p><p>So far, the best idea is to steal a shuttle that\u2019s strong enough to handle straight space, turn on the distress signal, and wait for rescue. I don\u2019t like the uncertainty, however. There\u2019s no telling who might pick us up.</p><p>At least this Jewel has a vested interest in my survival, since he wants to use me. Then again, there\u2019s no telling what he might do when he discovers we\u2019ve been picking off his guys. We need to get out of here, one way or another.</p><p>Still, I can\u2019t regret leaving Lachion with them. The arrival of another Conglomerate ship might\u2019ve had disastrous consequences for Gunnar-Dahlgren. Their battle is going to be hard enough.</p><p>\u201cI have studied their security in some detail,\u201d Vel says. \u201cAnd the only vessel we can access is the mini scheduled for repair. Using Constance\u2019s clearance codes, I assigned some tech droids to begin work immediately. Since it was not scheduled for maintenance until next week, they should not consider it a flight risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long before it\u2019s operational?\u201d Dina asks.</p><p>\u201cEight hours total,\u201d the bounty hunter answers. \u201cSeven hours remaining. I could not divert the entire fleet without arousing some suspicion. If this place were not almost entirely automated, questions would have arisen already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA point in our favor,\u201d Jael notes. \u201cAnd since the place is so big, they\u2019re probably still looking for the guys who went missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many do you think are on the grounds?\u201d I don\u2019t want to think about fighting our way out of here. Syndicate or not, I\u2019ve seen enough bloodshed to last a lifetime. Plus Dina and I still qualify as the weakest links.</p><p>We can\u2019t hold our own in a fight yet. I\u2019m stronger than I was\u2014and so is she\u2014but neither of us could take on a trained enforcer. But maybe Vel, Hit, and Jael are strong enough to make up the difference.</p><p>\u201cIn all?\u201d Hit asks.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>The pilot looks thoughtful. \u201cFor a place of this size, at least ten. Madame Kang would have insisted on twenty, though. But she relied more on manpower than technology. She was old-fashioned in some ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps the extra guards travel with the one called Mr. Jewel,\u201d Constance suggests. \u201cIn his absence, there is less to protect, only material goods, which can be replaced more easily than a person of some importance.\u201d</p><p>Jael squinches up his eyes at the droid, probably in remembered embarrassment. I let him flirt with her for a good five minutes before explaining why Dina and I were snickering.</p><p>Vel agrees. \u201cWhen their leader arrives, we will likely have more men with which to contend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason to get our asses out of here,\u201d Dina says flatly. \u201cWe should stay together, and in seven hours, we make a run for the shuttle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we have to shoot our way out, so be it.\u201d Jael spins a laser pistol he took off one of the guards.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about taking that thing on board,\u201d Hit warns him.</p><p>The merc glares at her. \u201cYou think I\u2019m stupid? I could dismantle that little skiff we\u2019re taking up with a sonicblade, let alone one of these. And I don\u2019t intend to experience the joy of vacuum firsthand.\u201d</p><p>Two alphas, one small ship. This will be fun.</p><p>\u201cSettle down,\u201d I say aloud. \u201cJael won\u2019t be taking any laser weapons up. He may look young, but he\u2019s not devoid of sense.\u201d</p><p>To my surprise, he slides me a layered look that ends in a half smile. By his expression, he read something significant into my defense, but I don\u2019t have time to figure out what. Maybe he hasn\u2019t been accepted like this before, and he appreciates when I have his back; I hope that\u2019s all it is. Hit doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s Bred, though, or she might be reluctant to work with him. I don\u2019t know her well enough to gauge her prejudices.</p><p>Vel says, \u201cWe should pack up our gear and convey it to a central location.\u201d</p><p>I suspect I won\u2019t be able to carry all the clothes I made in the wardrober, let alone fit them all in my pack. That holds three or four outfits at best, so I need to pick my favorites. When I reach Ielos, I want to make a good impression. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I refuse to think about alternative outcomes. We\u2019ll do this, and I\u2019ll be a real ambassador. I\u2019ll do anything to make this work with Ithiss-Tor. I\u2019ll even stick to Tarn\u2019s script if I have to, because I finally understand what\u2019s at stake.</p><p>I wish the bastard had leveled with me before we left New Terra. Then again, maybe I would have taken his fear as political maneuvering. Maybe I wouldn\u2019t have taken the threat seriously without seeing the carnage on Emry Station.</p><p>I push to my feet. \u201cCome on, Constance. Let\u2019s go make you a new outfit. You can\u2019t wear that to diplomatic functions.\u201d</p><p>The droid tips her head, studying her shiny silver halter dress. \u201cIt does look more appropriate for one who makes a living selling sexual favors, does it not?\u201d</p> <p>She startles a laugh out of me although she wasn\u2019t joking. The Lila unit does precisely that, so she was stating a fact. Constance watches us, as if trying to puzzle out why Jael, Dina, and Hit are laughing along with me, but she and Vel are not.</p><p>\u201cYep. Let\u2019s meet back here in six hours. Get your stuff, take a nap, but one way or another, we\u2019re out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdeally, Tarn will flag a ship already in the area,\u201d Jael puts in. \u201cSend someone to snag us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not think about everything that could go wrong.\u201d Hit makes herself comfortable on Dina\u2019s couch, so I guess she doesn\u2019t need to pack. Or maybe her stuff\u2019s already here. Not my business, but I admit to a certain amount of curiosity as to how Dina seduces every other woman she meets.</p><p>I mean, she\u2019s strong rather than svelte, with broad, muscular shoulders and a thick build. She does have gorgeous green eyes, though, and hair that shimmers like gold silk. Maybe it\u2019s the contrast between strength and softness.</p> <p>\u201cKeep staring at me like that, Jax, and I\u2019ll think you see something you like.\u201d She raises her gaze to give me a smoky half smile.</p><p>Okay, even I register a small spark when she levels that look on me. I don\u2019t even try to play it off. I flirt back a little. \u201cNice try. But I\u2019m not having you break March\u2019s heart by being irresistible.\u201d</p><p>The mechanic grins. \u201cIt\u2019s a curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe meet back in six hours,\u201d Jael cuts in. At my arched brow, he shrugs. \u201cA guy can only take so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Hit says. \u201cThey always picture themselves in the middle of the action, whether it has anything to do with them or not.\u201d</p><p>Leaving them to bicker, I head for the door. Constance falls into step beside me; already she moves with more assurance. \u201cGetting the hang of it?\u201d I ask her.</p> <p>\u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole having-a-body experience.\u201d</p><p>She considers that. \u201cI find it difficult to judge distances. I keep walking into walls where I should turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll work on it.\u201d</p><p>The halls remain eerily empty as we make our way back to my suite. First I show Constance how to use the wardrober, and leave her looking at patterns. Then I make myself a snack. She looks so real that I\u2019m tempted to offer her something to eat.</p><p>So I ask about that. \u201cCan you eat? As part of your companion function?\u201d</p><p>She pauses, tilting her head in a way that tells me she\u2019s accessing secondary systems. \u201cThis casing has a receptacle for masticated foodstuff, which needs to be emptied within twenty-four hours, or I would become malodorous.\u201d</p><p>Everything a rich, lonely man needs in order to pretend he has a real woman by his side. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t need you to use such social functions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am not worried,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI am here to facilitate all matters for you, Sirantha Jax. If that should involve simulating social intercourse, I am happy to oblige, now that I have a casing designed for such work.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t quite know what to say to that. Does that mean she\u2019d let me pimp her out? Then again, she\u2019s still an AI, no matter how fond I may have become of her. There\u2019s a thin gray line between sentient and self-willed. The wardrober hums as it produces a sober black suit. My PA has a strict sense of business attire, I guess.</p><p>With no sense of decorum, she immediately begins disrobing. \u201cYou may not want to do that with anyone else in the room,\u201d I advise.</p><p>She peers at me through a white blouse. \u201cIt is impolite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>I start going through my clothes, picking out the ones that look sophisticated enough to pass on any world, regardless of local fashions. Lots of black, some silvery gray, and a filmy white outfit that does nice things for my newly tanned skin. That will have to do for now. I wonder how March will like the new me.</p><p>Where is he now? Lost in the war he shouldn\u2019t have chosen? Does he ever think of me? And will I recognize him if he comes back to me?</p><p>I touch the gaudy ring he gave me as a promise, now suspended around my throat on a thin golden chain. That contact doesn\u2019t give me any sense of him, not a magical talisman, or a link to what we\u2019ve lost.</p><p>He might be dead. For a moment, the need to have March by my side overwhelms me. The longing steals my breath, nearly bends me double.</p><p>\u201cKeep an eye on things,\u201d I tell Constance. \u201cI\u2019m going to get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s that or weep, and I need to keep it together. I sprawl on the bed.</p><p>The next thing I know, my comm beeps red with an incoming message. I have no way of gauging how long I\u2019ve been out. \u201cAccept,\u201d I call to the terminal.</p><p>Then a disembodied voice\u2014no accompanying image\u2014 says, \u201cJewel will see you now.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 51</p><p>As catastrophes go, this one is fairly dire.</p><p>\u201cWarn the others,\u201d I mutter to Constance.</p><p>I honestly thought we were being held indefinitely. I didn\u2019t think there was any such person named Jewel, and if there was, based on what Grubb and Boyle said, he had no intention of meeting with me. We didn\u2019t factor this eventuality into the plan. And we\u2019re just forty-five minutes from departure, too.</p><p>I try to calm down. The others will figure out a way around this. Nobody will interfere with a pleasure droid roaming the halls, so she\u2019ll get word to them. I just need to stall for time.</p><p>When I come out into the pale, cool corridor, I find Keller waiting for me. \u201cDid you enjoy your party?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s definitely an upside to being portrayed as a brainless thrillseeker on the news vids. Generally, my reputation works against me, but here, it serves us well.</p><p>\u201cVery much.\u201d I offer a sweet smile. \u201cYou should have come along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, business arose from my employer\u2019s imminent arrival. You\u2019ll wait in the central salon.\u201d</p><p>Right. That shuts me up as nothing else could have. Instead I listen to our footsteps echoing ahead of us. All too soon, Keller deposits me in a large, overly empty lounge, complete with ornate floral arrangements and a rushing fountain in the center of the room. The chairs grouped here and there look stiff and formal, more for show than comfort.</p><p>\u201cWould you like refreshments?\u201d Keller asks, suddenly obsequious. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be long now.\u201d</p><p>I feel oddly like the prisoner whose last request cannot be denied. So I refuse everything and elect to remain standing. I\u2019d rather be ready to run.</p><p>Keller nods, heading for a hallway other than the one we entered through. I wander the room while trying to pretend I\u2019m not conscious of the minutes ticking away. I hope Constance has gotten word to the others by now.</p><p>I don\u2019t hear any footsteps beneath the rushing fountain, but I sense I have company. Pinning on a smile, I turn\u2014 and find my mother standing there. Shit. I didn\u2019t see that coming.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re holding you, too? Are you all right?\u201d I\u2019m not the most dutiful daughter, I admit, but we\u2019ll take her with us when we go.</p><p>As she glides closer, I see she looks different than she did at the coffeehouse. She carries herself with an indefinable air of confidence down to her perfectly manicured fingertips. Today she\u2019s not a trembling bundle of nerves, fearing for her life. Ramona Jax lent me my bone structure, but she fills out a dress better than I do. Rejuvenex treatments have left her smooth-skinned and ageless.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t put it together,\u201d she says with a faint half smile.</p><p>\u201cPut . . .\u201d And then it clicks. \u201cYou\u2019re Jewel. There\u2019s no man behind the mirror, or rather . . . he is you. How the hell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you think your father\u2019s pathetic little art gallery funded our lifestyle? Honestly, Sirantha, sometimes I think you\u2019re more his child than mine. If I didn\u2019t know you\u2019d gotten your need for adrenaline from me, I\u2019d suspect the worst.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s good, amazingly good, if she fooled March. Maybe she\u2019s like me, completely compartmentalized\u2014 maybe that\u2019s where I got the ability. So she can be the terrified victim one moment and a ruthless Syndicate boss the next.</p><p>I don\u2019t even know what to ask first. No wonder Jewel didn\u2019t want me harmed. Whatever else can be said of my mother, she possesses enough vanity not to want to erase her own genetic legacy.</p><p>Unless she has to.</p><p>Looking at her now, I can honestly say I\u2019ve never seen her true face before. She\u2019s only ever shown me the feather-headed socialite. But in reality, she\u2019s pure steel wrapped in shiny paper.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, I got that from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always wanted more, too,\u201d she answers. \u201cI was always after the next thrill; I just hid it better, that\u2019s all. I still can\u2019t believe I convinced your father to . . .\u201d Ramona lifts her shoulders in an eloquent shrug. \u201cDuring a jump. It\u2019s no wonder you love grimspace so well.\u201d</p><p>I actually stagger back a step. \u201cI was . . . conceived in grimspace?\u201d</p><p>As if I haven\u2019t spoken, she bypasses me in a cloud of expensive perfume, programming a serving droid with a drink order. \u201cDo you still like that dreadful Tokaji Cuv\u00e9e?\u201d</p><p>Fine, I\u2019ll pretend this is a reunion. For now. My head reels with the implications. It\u2019s a wonder I\u2019m not brain damaged, if that\u2019s where I got my start. Mary, Doc would have a field day with this info.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had it in years, too dear for my blood these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome, darling, don\u2019t be coy. You\u2019ve done quite well for yourself, considering the initial course you chose.\u201d</p><p>Knowing this will irk her, I say deliberately, \u201cI don\u2019t have a single credit to my name, Mother. Simon managed to snatch it all, and now my personal assets are tied up in the Farwan financial debacle.\u201d</p><p>She dismisses that with a wave of the hand. \u201cNothing a good barrister can\u2019t sort out. I meant in terms of prestige, Sirantha. I have use for an ambassador.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to let you use me,\u201d I bite out. \u201cThose days are done. They have been for a while.\u201d</p><p>The bot returns with our drinks, its abdomen opening to reveal a silver tray. I accept mine, but I don\u2019t know if I should drink it. Would she stoop to drugging me? I honestly don\u2019t know.</p><p>I hold the glass to the light, admiring the burnished gold of a good sweet wine. I spoke the truth\u2014haven\u2019t had this vintage in years\u2014made from grapes, raisins, peach, apricot, and underlaid with eucalyptus. Everything I drink is either synthetic or some horrendous homebrew that burns like acid going down. Gets you drunk just the same, though, which was my goal back then. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not tainted,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t need to resort to such measures.

Or perhaps you think you\u2019ve accomplished something by sneaking around the villa, lurking here and there like common criminals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better to be an uncommon criminal like you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a businesswoman,\u201d she says with unruffled aplomb. \u201cYou distressed your father so much, you know, when you left that expensive finishing school.

Don\u2019t want to. Her dark eyes have no bottom, and to my fevered imagination, it seems . . . no soul. No moral compass that tells her right from wrong. There\u2019s a calculator instead, measuring value versus expenditure.</p><p>\u201cI made a few investments with them, quietly, of course, and without your father\u2019s knowledge. He never would\u2019ve approved.\u201d</p><p>Outrage sharpens my voice. \u201cYou think? Maybe that\u2019s because he had a conscience, and he wouldn\u2019t have wanted to spend credits that came from misery, vice, and murder.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t mind spending my money on ugly, expensive paintings that nobody ever bought,\u201d she snaps. \u201cHe had no business or aesthetic sense at all.\u201d</p><p>Oh, I hit a nerve with that. For a moment, I let myself enjoy the sensation. She doesn\u2019t hold all the cards like she thinks she does. Our little group possesses skills she can\u2019t imagine.</p><p>Nausea sweeps over me when I put it together. \u201cYou killed him. Or had him killed. And then put out word that he\u2019d used a Eutha-booth.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t even try to deny it. \u201cHis little hobby was expensive and tiresome. And with the expansion to my territory, I needed the freedom to come and go without awkward questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter so many years together, that\u2019s all he was to you? Awkward, expensive, and tiresome?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m gazing into the eyes of a monster. I can\u2019t let down my guard\u2014the fact that she\u2019s my mother provides no guarantees. I know that now.</p> <p>\u201cYour father was obsolete,\u201d she says in final tones.</p><p>Like machinery.</p><p>I tuck this new hurt away with all the others, to be dealt with later. If I don\u2019t get away from her, there will be no later. She\u2019ll figure out some way to use me, or she\u2019ll dispose of me. For her, there are no other options. She prefers the former, but she won\u2019t balk at the latter.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you\u2019d kill him, of course you wouldn\u2019t hesitate to start a war.\u201d I sound calm, much calmer than I feel. \u201cYou really don\u2019t care that thousands of people will die? Do you know what the bodies look like after a Morgut attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m told it\u2019s quite painless,\u201d she assures me. \u201cThe first bite injects a neurotoxin that blocks the nerve endings, resulting in paralysis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s money to be made. Weapons to sell. Private security contracts.\u201d I test our theories to see how close we came to the truth.</p><p>\u201cAt least you sorted out what, if not who. You\u2019re a bright girl, Sirantha.\u201d</p><p>I wonder if she had anything to do with the assassination attempt on New Terra. \u201cDid you blow up my Skimmer? What happened, you thought better of trying to use me after we had coffee?\u201d</p> <p>Ramona shakes her head. \u201cThat was a simple misunderstanding. I disciplined the person involved in the error.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many pieces did he end up in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve.\u201d And I don\u2019t think she\u2019s joking. \u201cI\u2019m sorry my men broke into your quarters. They seemed to think I wanted you terrorized for some reason, as if fear ever governs women like us.\u201d She laughs lightly.</p><p>I hate that she lumps me in with her. If this is how she runs things, I bet she doesn\u2019t pay much in pensions. It also explains Keller\u2019s handling of the poor bastard who fucked up in the nav chair. Thank Mary, that had nothing to do with me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one scary bitch,\u201d I say, shaking my head. \u201cI had no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still don\u2019t.\u201d She tips back her head and drains her drink. \u201cFor instance . . . I\u2019m having your crew killed as we speak.\u201d</p><p>I turn for the door, draw up short at the sound of laser fire. Unless they changed plans after Constance got to them\u2014if she did\u2014they\u2019re all gathered together, waiting for me.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>She smiles. \u201cIn fact, they might already be dead.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 52</p><p>l refuse to show fear. \u201cYou don\u2019t know them as well as I do.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, I\u2019m glad March isn\u2019t here. I prefer he never finds out how much crazy runs up and down my family tree.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re expecting them to burst in and take me hostage, Sirantha?\u201d Ramona lofts a brow in gentle skepticism. \u201cKeller and his team can handle them. You didn\u2019t honestly think Grubb and Boyle were our best, did you? There\u2019s a reason I culled you from the herd now, darling. I didn\u2019t want you caught in the cross fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you realize you caught one of Madame Kang\u2019s best when you cast your net.\u201d A shot in the dark, because surely Keller mentioned it.</p><p>The name means nothing to me, but it inspired fear in her hired goons. Maybe it\u2019ll affect my mother the same way.</p><p>Her eyes widen, and something swirls in their empty depths. \u201cLies. All Kang\u2019s girls died when we raided her on Gehenna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all,\u201d Hit calls. \u201cShe may be gone, but I remember everything she taught me. You sent ten men for four of us?\u201d Her laugh rings out.</p><p>From another direction, echoing oddly, I hear Jael\u2019s voice. \u201cYou underestimated Jax\u2019s crew. Bet you rue that later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we let you,\u201d Vel adds.</p><p>I can\u2019t tell where any of them are. It sounds like they\u2019ve got the place surrounded, though, and I assume they\u2019re all armed. So does Ramona. She makes a great show of holding up her hands.</p><p>\u201cYou win,\u201d she says lightly. But fury seethes in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m helpless now. Show yourselves so I can surrender.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s weak as a boa constrictor, but they\u2019re not stupid enough to fall for that. Dina and Constance remain unaccounted for, but it makes sense if they went ahead to the ship. Neither of them would be much help in a fight.</p><p>Jael steps from behind an ornate decorative screen, spattered in blood and gore. And I\u2019ve never been so glad to see anyone in my life. I take a step toward him, but he holds up a hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, I need to deal with her first. It pisses me off when people I don\u2019t know try to kill me in my sleep. Well . . . where I would\u2019ve been sleeping, anyway, if I wasn\u2019t such a chary bastard.\u201d</p><p>Ramona lifts her chin. \u201cJust make it quick.\u201d</p><p>This is where I\u2019m supposed to intervene, stop him from killing her. Instead I turn my back. I expect to hear the quick whine of a laser pistol, but when I glance over my shoulder, I find Jael tying her up. He gags her before she can say we haven\u2019t seen the last of her, or promise to make us sorry.</p><p>I\u2019m already sorry she\u2019s related to me. Does that count? I watch him wind the thin filament around her wrists. If she struggles too hard, she\u2019ll cut herself.</p><p>\u201cI thought you don\u2019t like leaving anyone alive on your backtrail.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cI can\u2019t kill an unarmed woman. Call me old-fashioned. But you can shoot her if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my mother,\u201d I point out.</p><p>\u201cSo that means you can\u2019t shoot her?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, I consider asking Hit to do it. I certainly can\u2019t. Though I suspect I\u2019ll regret letting Ramona live, I just don\u2019t have that much ice in my veins. I hope she\u2019ll walk away, leaving me out of her schemes after this.</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d I can\u2019t be the reason she\u2019s killed. If nothing else, her hungry, junkie spirit made me who\u2014and what\u2014I am today.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get the hell out of here before more goons turn up.\u201d With that, he signals to the others that we\u2019re moving out. \u201cThankfully she didn\u2019t send all her guys after us, or we might\u2019ve had some trouble.\u201d</p><p>The way he looks, they did have some, but I don\u2019t speak, mainly because our trot steals my breath. I need to do some endurance training one of these days. One hand clamped against my side, I try to keep up with Jael\u2019s long, loping strides.</p><p>He\u2019s apparently been studying the layout because he makes the turns with surety, leading us from the central salon to the corridor that adjoins the docking area. The walls become less decorative, more functional, and tile gives way to plain plaster.</p><p>Footsteps echo through the hallway behind us.</p><p>\u201cFuck. She called them faster than I gave her credit for. I should\u2019ve shot her.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re nearly to the private docking bay. I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re getting out, but as laser fire comes hot and hard on our heels, I hope like hell they have a plan. I dive and roll, coming to my feet around the corner.</p><p>Jael still has the pistol he was playing with in Dina\u2019s room, so he covers me. Orange light flashes all around, searing the ground. I hope Hit and Vel got here before us because it looks like the party\u2019s in full swing. I can\u2019t tell how many guys Ramona has left, but she should\u2019ve sent them all at my crew at once. The ragtag remainder fires on us, thinking they can keep us pinned down.</p><p>Thing is, lasers can\u2019t kill Jael. So he shoves me along toward the shuttle, taking hit after hit. He groans low in his throat, but he doesn\u2019t falter, and Dina pulls us on board. She slams a palm on the comm panel, and barks, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger that,\u201d comes Hit\u2019s disembodied voice. \u201cHang on, it might get rough.\u201d</p><p>The shuttle engines fire up, drowning out the sound of lasers striking the hull. If we don\u2019t get a move on, we might be looking at a breach; and then we\u2019re fucked. Damn, I can\u2019t get my breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d the mechanic demands.</p><p>\u201cEveryone else here?\u201d I bend over, hands on knees.</p><p>\u201cYeah. After she warned us about the change in plan, Constance came in with me, and we prepped the ship. The other three killed a few guys, and saved your ass.\u201d</p><p>The understatement makes me smile. We lurch as Hit takes us up, and Dina swears beneath her breath when she slams into the wall. I hear more than see her head for the seats. We all need to strap in.</p><p>When my vision stops sparkling from oxygen deprivation, I straighten and check on Jael. Propped up against the wall, he looks pale and clammy, eyes clenched tight. He smells of smoke and charred flesh, so a shudder runs through me when I step closer. But he\u2019s not dead like the victims on the Sargasso.</p><p>He needs me.</p><p>Steadying myself with a deep breath, I wrap an arm around his waist. \u201cI\u2019ve got you, come on. They left the last two seats for us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A muffled explosion rocks the ship, and at first I think we\u2019ve been hit, but instead of crashing into the roof, we just keep going up. The shock field doesn\u2019t have full vertical coverage, so once we get some altitude we\u2019re home free.</p><p>There\u2019s only the cockpit and a small hub on this boxy little skiff, so we don\u2019t have far to go. I see Dina sitting beside Vel, so Constance must be up front with the pilot. Jael collapses, and I nearly go down with him before I get my balance.</p><p>I know firsthand just how excruciating burns can be. Even through layers of narcotics, I remember lying in medical, feeling each one of my nerve endings curl and char over and over again. There\u2019s no pain like it.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p> <p>Eyes still closed, he takes my hand in his. Damn near pulverizes my knuckles. In fact, given my bone condition, fractures might result. Since he took the shots for me, I\u2019ll take this. It\u2019ll heal. Maybe slower than someone else, but I\u2019m not weak.</p><p>I refuse to be.</p><p>\u201cThis . . . really fucking stings,\u201d he gasps, after a moment. \u201cNo matter how many times I\u2019m shot, I never get used to it. Just . . . glad they didn\u2019t have disruptors. Talk about painful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can heal even that?\u201d I ask without thinking.</p><p>Jael raises haunted eyes to mine. \u201cYeah. Even that.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d only know that if he\u2019d healed the damage from it. I want to ask when. Was it in a battle he chose, or part of inhuman lab testing? He doesn\u2019t talk about his early life, before the government disbanded the program, and cut the survivors loose.</p><p>In a way, I probably understand him better than anyone. I\u2019m pretty damn close to Bred myself, though I\u2019m not ready to talk about it. What kind of freak am I, conceived in grimspace? I wonder if that has anything to do with why technology breaks down around me. Doc would want to run tests, but he\u2019s on Lachion, healing the wounded from a war he won\u2019t fight.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be all right.\u201d I force a smile and brush back a burnished lock of sweat-damp hair, intending it as a casual, appreciative gesture.</p><p>But Jael leans his forehead against my palm. His eyelids drift down as if my touch offers some unfamiliar benediction. Tremors course through him in waves, and I can almost sense the reparation of damaged cells, wracking him. He acts like he needs this small point of contact for reasons I can\u2019t begin to delve.</p><p>\u201cLooks like we\u2019re clear,\u201d Hit announces over the comm. \u201cI got stars on the screen and no sign of pursuit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet. They will find us if we are not collected by another vessel,\u201d Vel says.</p> <p>Drawing back before I yield to the urge to hug Jael, I tap the comm panel on the arm of my seat. \u201cTurn on the distress signal, and let\u2019s hope for the best.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 53</p><p>lf you\u2019ve never tried hauling straight space in a skiff, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re missing.</p><p>I don\u2019t mean that in a good way, of course. It feels like I\u2019ve driven in mudside vehicles that go faster than this. I can still see the jewel-bright hues of Venice Minor behind us, and even though we\u2019ve been flying for a while, it would only take a real cutter an hour to catch up with us.</p><p>Dina sabotaged a couple of their ships, but she didn\u2019t have time to be thoroughly destructive. Just cut a few wires, here and there, remove a few parts. They\u2019ll get one up and running soon, and then\u2014</p><p>The comm crackles, and Hit\u2019s voice fills the tiny hub. \u201cTwo ships incoming, different trajectories. Both on intercept course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>But it\u2019s not like we have weapons or shields or anything to ready us for an attack. A larger ship will just nail us with magnetic tow cables and haul us into its hold. That\u2019s how tiny this box is.</p> <p>\u201cHope for the best.\u201d Dina shifts in her seat to glare over her shoulder at me. \u201cDoes that work for you a lot?\u201d</p><p>I lift a shoulder. \u201cNever tried it before. We usually have a half-assed plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife in your vicinity seldom lacks excitement,\u201d Vel observes.</p><p>Was that a compliment? Or more like the ancient curse: May you live in interesting times? Ignoring that, I call the cockpit to respond, \u201cI\u2019d say take evasive action until we find out who it is and what they want, but I don\u2019t know how well this thing handles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do,\u201d Hit comes back.</p><p>\u201cHow long before intercept?\u201d I ask.</p><p>There\u2019s a pause while she presumably checks the data. And then Constance replies, \u201cApproximately twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay strapped in,\u201d the pilot adds.</p><p>My shoulders feel knotted, a thread of tension wrapping around my spine. I hate that I can\u2019t just jump us away from here. We\u2019re so close to grimspace\u2014the place where I began\u2014that I can almost sense the beacons, pulsing in echo to my heartbeat. What will my next jump be like? Returning to my place of origin.</p><p>No wonder each jump always felt like coming home.</p><p>Whether those two ships intend to help or harm us, there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. I hate feeling helpless, and I\u2019ve had that sensation too much lately. Unless they intend to destroy us, they won\u2019t waste power on weapons, though. This vessel is simply too small and fragile.</p><p>Jael sits beside me, silent and distant. I think he regrets that moment where he showed a hint of vulnerability, where he leaned his head against my hand. He won\u2019t look at me, but I have other things to worry about. Like those two ships.</p><p>We sit in tense silence, wondering about the outcome. Wondering who else is hunting us. Let me just say, that gets old. I\u2019m afraid to hope that Tarn\u2019s come through, sent someone to the rescue, but I\u2019ll guarantee one of those ships belongs to dear old Mum. She doesn\u2019t strike me as a good loser.</p><p>\u201cThey have arrived,\u201d Constance advises us over the comm.</p><p>The tiny skiff shakes, and something clunks against the side. Tow cables? I wish I were in the nav chair where I could see what\u2019s going on. But this thing doesn\u2019t have a nav chair, and Constance is doubtless more help to Hit, analyzing numbers and probabilities with lightning speed.</p><p>\u201cWarning shots over our bow,\u201d Hit reports. \u201cWe\u2019ve got one set of tow cables on us, but the smaller ship appears to be powering up weapons.\u201d Another pause. \u201cShots fired. They\u2019re engaging.\u201d</p><p>I tap the comm. \u201cCan you make out ship names or numbers?\u201d</p><p>After a brief pause, Constance answers, \u201cI recognize the larger vessel from the docking bay on Venice Minor. They are attempting to pull us in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, we\u2019re not going back there. Can we break those cables somehow?\u201d I sit forward and look at Vel, my resident answer man.</p><p>He replies by calling the cockpit. \u201cA localized electrical surge might short out their magnet. But it might also damage our vessel and leave us dead in space.\u201d</p><p>My mother intends to kill everyone aboard, maybe even me at this point. \u201cBetter dead in space than dead on Venice Minor.\u201d</p><p>Hit evidently shares the sentiment because she says, \u201cI\u2019ll have Constance see what she can do. If anyone can manage the calculations without blowing us all to shit, it\u2019s her. Now hang on, I\u2019m going to spiral, see if I can tangle up those tow wires.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Every time the ship rolls, my stomach does a slow spin as well. I imagine us like fish on a line, struggling with all our strength to break free. I hope we don\u2019t get blown up in some dispute we have nothing to do with. Since we\u2019re attached to the Syndicate ship, if it goes up, we\u2019re likely close enough to take damage as well. And with no shields, no armor plating, we just aren\u2019t sturdy enough to soak it.</p><p>I say a prayer to the gods of luck.</p><p>\u201cReport,\u201d I demand, tapping the button again.</p><p>At this rate, Hit will cut off communications from the cabin to the cockpit. But she doesn\u2019t sound irked. Rather, excitement infuses her voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anybody fly like this,\u201d she answers. \u201cWhoever\u2019s handling the small ship has magic in his hands. He fires, hits, slings sideways, dives underneath the bigger ship, just daring a collision . . . it\u2019s beautiful to watch. So far they haven\u2019t landed a single shot on him.\u201d</p><p>March. Stupid, I know, but my heart leaps in purely emotional response. Intellectually, I know it can\u2019t be him. He\u2019s on Lachion, and at this point, I don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s alive or dead.</p><p>\u201cGet that cable off us,\u201d Dina barks into the comm. \u201cOr they\u2019ll take us with them when they blow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking,\u201d Constance responds. \u201cI must be sure of my calculations, or I will damage this vessel beyond repair.\u201d</p><p>Bad choice, no choice. Either way, we wind up dead. Someone\u2019s got to make the call, and they seem to think I\u2019m in charge, most days.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d I tell her. \u201cIf the battle\u2019s going south out there, we\u2019ll wind up as collateral damage. Welcome to my world.\u201d</p><p>A jolt rocks the skiff as she complies with my order. The lights flicker, giving the cabin a surreal air. Jael shifts and gazes at me in the weird, stuttering light. I glimpse his eyes in staccato flashes, see his lips moving, but I hear no sound.</p><p>Red lights come on along the ceiling, lending everything a bloody glow. Then the onboard computer chimes a warning. \u201cWarning. Electrical fault. Please seek safe landing facilities immediately. Life-support failure imminent.\u201d</p><p>And then we go careening through space. I can tell the difference between a guided roll and the way we\u2019re spinning. Hit has limited control, if any, and I don\u2019t think the comm\u2019s working anymore.</p><p>I\u2019ve always hated tiny vessels, for good reason as it turns out. There\u2019s only a thin barrier between merciless vacuum and us. What the hell\u2019s going on? I\u2019m tempted to unstrap and fight my way up front to see, but maybe I\u2019m better off not knowing. I\u2019d probably get myself hurt, too, slamming into walls.</p><p>Dina swears steadily in front of me, creative curses that I\u2019d be memorizing with great interest at any other time. The bounty hunter remains silent, still, and I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s injured or praying to some strange Ithtorian god. We haven\u2019t had a chance to go over religion or mythology yet, dammit.</p><p>Jael touches my arm. His fingers feel warm and strong, and I consciously check the urge to reach for him. I tell myself it\u2019s not personal; at a time like this, it\u2019s natural to want to hold on to someone. Nobody wants to die alone.</p><p>This time I can make out the words beneath the strident alarm as the ship\u2019s computer counts down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I lean over as best I can. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>He can\u2019t possibly blame himself. That\u2019s ridiculous. Too many factors converged to land us in this mess, nothing he could\u2019ve prevented. But his eyes beg for forgiveness just the same.</p><p>\u201cBecause\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before he finishes the thought, I feel another thunk on our side. Tow cable? At this point I can only guess, and try not to toss up.</p><p>I hope that means the smaller ship has won and that it\u2019s someone we want to see, once we get inside. More to the point, someone with a jumper, and a functional phase drive who will take us far away from here. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We roll, end over end, until something snaps taut.

A slim redhead sits at a terminal nearby, examining data on the screen, and there\u2019s a droid as well, probably her assistant. This doesn\u2019t look like a drug-induced hallucination. I\u2019ve seen the woman somewhere before.</p><p>She murmurs, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019re taking care of everything. According to Chancellor Tarn, Ielos is the next stop on your goodwill tour. We\u2019ve got guards on board to make sure nothing else goes wrong.\u201d</p><p>But my brain is too rattled to make necessary connections. A dull throb lives behind my eyes, pain made distant by the welcome advent of medication. I\u2019m too tired to ask anything at the moment, so I just drift.</p><p>On awakening for the second time, I think:</p><p>Well, holy shit.</p> <p>It worked. I can\u2019t believe our plan actually worked. I feel more like an interstellar hitchhiker than a dignitary who commands respect, but what the hell. If this vessel, whomever it belongs to, gets me to Ielos, I\u2019ll take it. Now I can start keeping my promises, make up for all the trouble.</p><p>I realize I\u2019ve lost another bag full of new clothes. Mary curse it, I may as well take up nudism. I haven\u2019t been able to keep up with my belongings since the Sargsasso crash. I sigh.</p><p>The sound snags the woman\u2019s attention, and when she turns, I place her immediately. Rose looks better than she did on Lachion, more rested, but there\u2019s no mistaking her tousled curls, frosted with silver. My heart immediately spikes with excited anticipation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d she says unnecessarily. \u201cGood thing, too. We\u2019re nearly there now. How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, struggling toward a sitting position. \u201cBeen better, been worse. Is Doc on board?\u201d That\u2019s not who I want to ask about first. Of course it\u2019s not.</p><p>Maybe . . . just maybe . . .</p> <p>I\u2019m afraid to let myself hope.</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s asleep. It\u2019s technically the middle of the night. But someone had to stay. You took quite a knock on the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry for stealing your sleep. But thank you for watching over me.\u201d I can\u2019t fight a sinking sensation. If March were here, surely he wouldn\u2019t have left my side, not until I woke up.</p><p>The fact that Rose has carefully avoided mentioning his name says it all. If I were stronger, I\u2019d demand to know what happened, but at the moment, I just can\u2019t. I have to pick my battles, and I don\u2019t have the fortitude for this one. I refuse to hear it.</p><p>I\u2019m not hanging around Med Bay for another second. With unsteady hands I push to my feet and wobble, watching the room swim. After a moment, I manage to let go of the cot and stand, swaying, under my own power. Given another minute or two, I\u2019ll be able to walk. Shit. I need my bag. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s past time for an injection. I\u2019m getting stronger, so I don\u2019t want to retard my progress.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my pack?\u201d</p><p>The redhead glances up from the screen at last. \u201cConstance said to tell you she has all of your belongings, including the clothes you left on Venice Minor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d What a PA . . . helpful administrator doesn\u2019t begin to cover it. That\u2019s the best news I\u2019ve had in quite a while.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s odd,\u201d Rose observes. \u201cVery formal.\u201d</p><p>So they have no idea she\u2019s a droid. I guess they\u2019ve never run across the Lila model. No shock since she was retired in favor of the ones with giant breasts and shiny silver hair.</p><p>\u201cThings are better on Lachion?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head as if in disbelief. \u201cMuch. The other clans swore fealty to Gunnar-Dahlgren after seeing how it went for Clan McCullough. In fifty turns, that\u2019s never happened.\u201d</p><p>March always said he knew killing. That seems like a sad epitaph.</p><p>I ache. \u201cWhere did you find a jumper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were a number of jumpers stranded on Lachion,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThey had the bad timing to be delivering supplies when you showed up.\u201d</p><p>Fantastic. I wonder where all the Farwan jumpers wound up.</p><p>\u201cAm I cleared to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she answers.</p><p>After a few steps, I regain my balance, and by the time I reach the door, I\u2019ve stopped feeling like I might tip over. I need to check on everyone.</p><p>Out in the corridor, which is tinted a particularly bilious yellow, I stop the first person I see. \u201cExcuse me, where are we bound?\u201d</p><p>The kid looks like he\u2019s barely eighteen, running errands for somebody. \u201cWe\u2019re taking the ambassador to Ielos.\u201d</p><p>So it\u2019s true. Tension I didn\u2019t even register flows out of me, making me aware of various aches and pains. Not debilitating, however\u2014considering what we\u2019ve been through, I feel strong, stronger than I have in months.</p><p>My stride gains speed as I explore the ship. Various crewmen nod at me in passing, like they recognize me as a person in authority. That\u2019s a new sensation.</p><p>I could go looking for Doc, but as Rose said, it\u2019s the middle of the night. I don\u2019t want to wake him. I\u2019m also not sure I\u2019m fit company right now.</p><p>March must be dead. If the war on Lachion let up sufficiently for Gunnar-Dahlgren to equip a ship in answer to Tarn\u2019s plea, enough for Rose and Doc to take off from treating the wounded, then the outcome must be decided, one way or another. I guess they won, but . . . the price was too high.</p><p>There\u2019s no other reason he wouldn\u2019t have come. Unlike most, his promises mean something. No words are sufficient to describe this loss. I thought I knew pain when Kai died, but this\u2014</p><p>A hole has opened up inside me.</p><p>He won the war for them, and it destroyed him. Though I\u2019d known it would happen when I left him on Lachion, the incontrovertible evidence wrecks me.</p><p>Mary, I can\u2019t live without him. I don\u2019t even want to try.</p><p>Some mechanistic part of me keeps me walking loops around the ship\u2019s deck. It\u2019s like I expect to come out somewhere else, but each time it carries me back where I began. The clansmen who make up the crew begin giving me odd looks.</p><p>I can\u2019t resist the urge to find somewhere quiet to grieve. A primal scream is building inside me, so I duck into the first cabin that isn\u2019t keyed to someone else. Must be vacant, or maybe it\u2019s mine. I didn\u2019t ask Rose about accommodations.</p><p>The dark doesn\u2019t surprise me, but the weirdly flickering vid screens all over the room certainly give me pause. And then I spy what\u2019s on them. Sirantha Jax, asleep in Med Bay, pacing the corridors, and older clips still. Me, as I step off a vessel with Kai. Me, holding both fists in the air as I stagger out of a barroom brawl.</p><p>This isn\u2019t entertainment so much as a shrine. Someone is mourning me as if I were dead. There\u2019s only one person who would surround himself with me like this. But it doesn\u2019t make sense. I\u2019m here. Why isn\u2019t he with me?</p><p>As my eyes adjust, I see a dark figure sprawled in a chair. I can\u2019t make out his features, but all my senses insist it\u2019s March. The door whooshes shut behind me.</p><p>\u201cI wondered how soon you\u2019d find me,\u201d he says quietly.</p><p>I mumble something about it being a fair-sized ship. I want to be glad because, whatever else is wrong, at least he\u2019s not dead. But what sits in this small, dark room might be worse, if anything could be.</p><p>I take a step toward him, but his stillness alarms me. Something prevents me from running to him. He feels . . . wrong somehow.</p><p>If only I could see his eyes . . .</p><p>My voice comes out raw. \u201cRose was careful not to mention you. I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I asked her not to. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He doesn\u2019t look at me. I can\u2019t make out his features, but I can tell he\u2019s still staring at his Jax collection on the screens.</p><p>This isn\u2019t how I envisioned our reunion, when I dared think about it at all. The silence wears on me, but I don\u2019t know what to say to him. Words pile up in my throat, leaving me mute.</p><p>March became part of me as nobody else ever had, but this isn\u2019t the man who pined for me, who would\u2019ve killed the world if anything happened to me. Oddly enough, I feel as though I\u2019m standing before a stranger.</p><p>\u201cHow did it go on Lachion?\u201d I manage to ask.</p><p>Pointless small talk. I already got the gist from Rose.</p><p>\u201cSlaughtered the McCulloughs to a man,\u201d he answers, low. \u201cThe tunnels ran with blood, and then the Teras turned on them. After that, we hunted them through all their holdings. I haven\u2019t seen killing like that since I left Nicu Tertius.\u201d</p><p>Where, he told me, he slew thousands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you made it.\u201d That\u2019s not what I want to say. It\u2019s banal, but the unearthly chill streaming off of him makes me want to turn tail and run.</p><p>Intellectually, I understand the need for him to disconnect from his emotions. How could he annihilate his fellow man if he felt anything for them? This, then, is what Mair saved him from before. But the price for such detachment comes steep.</p><p>Because I stand on the other side of the wall and I don\u2019t know how to reach him. I don\u2019t know what Mair did or how to bring him back. He promised I\u2019d see him again, and he\u2019s kept that vow. I touch the ring he gave me, hoping for inspiration. Where do we go from here?</p><p>Well, for me, there\u2019s no direction except toward him. I ignore his body language; his muscles seem coiled and ready to fight. I don\u2019t want to believe he\u2019ll hurt me, but Mary, I\u2019m afraid. He\u2019s like a wounded beast that doesn\u2019t recognize a friendly hand.</p><p>I reach toward his face with trembling fingertips. He lashes out, a move that would\u2019ve broken my forearm if he\u2019d connected. I leap back, shaken.</p><p>But I don\u2019t quit. Maybe I\u2019m not Mair, but I\u2019ll figure this out. I won\u2019t lose him.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? I don\u2019t care. I should, but I don\u2019t. You could\u2019ve put a million McCulloughs in the ground, and I wouldn\u2019t care as long as it means you\u2019re here with me.\u201d</p><p>He shudders. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be. I should\u2019ve cut and run once I saw you were all right. I could hurt you, Jax. Kill you in my sleep. Even though I remember how I used to feel about you, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d March makes a slashing gesture with one hand.</p><p>I catch on. He can\u2019t access it, as if some necessary neurological pathway has been severed. Afraid to touch him, I seal a kiss into my palm and then blow it into the air. It\u2019s a romantic gesture, not like me at all, but I intend it to be symbolic of how far I\u2019m willing to go for him.</p><p>\u201cI need you, March. I was scared as hell to admit it, but I can\u2019t do without you, and if that makes me broken . . .\u201d I shrug. \u201cI\u2019ll take you any way I can get you. And I don\u2019t give a damn what you\u2019ve done. You will never be rid of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how much I don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d He pitches the comment low, almost dispassionate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His gaze belies his words. March stares at me as if I stand across a chasm he has no hope of crossing. Maybe he can\u2019t feel the warmth between us, but it exists. There must be a bridge, so I\u2019ll take the first step toward finding it.</p><p>\u201cI want you inside me.\u201d</p><p>After a moment of silent resistance, his icy soul fills mine.</p><p>CHAPTER 55</p> <p>lt\u2019s not a fix, but a reminder of what we lost. By the time March pulls out, I\u2019m shivering. I\u2019ll never give up on him, but this will take time. We have to figure out how to repair what\u2019s been broken, as Mair did.</p><p>Instead of walking away, I sit with him quietly in the dark.</p><p>Hours later, I locate my crew in the starboard lounge. They all seem to be in good shape, drinks in hand. Vel sits with his handheld, tapping away. The last vestige of fear dissipates, and that\u2019s new, too.</p><p>I feel responsible for these people, not in the usual way, which involves making sure I get the jump right. In the past, that\u2019s all the accountability I acknowledged. What befalls someone when I\u2019m not in the nav chair, well, that\u2019s not my fault. Right?</p><p>Wrong. For crazy misbegotten reasons, they follow me, so what happens to them, it\u2019s on me. They call this leadership, I think, but it\u2019s new. I crackle with it.</p> <p>\u201cHell of a thing,\u201d Dina says with a grin. She pushes from her chair and limps over to me, just about crushing my ribs in a hug.</p><p>\u201cI am glad to see you recovered,\u201d Constance tells me.</p><p>Is she glad? Can she be? For just a moment, I put aside my questions about her nature, or what she can learn, and accept what she says at face value.</p><p>\u201cYou did a helluva job,\u201d I answer. \u201cWithout you, everyone would be dead, and I\u2019d be captive to my mother\u2019s warmongering.\u201d</p><p>The PA pauses as if parsing my words. And then she says, delightfully, unintentionally modest: \u201cI am here to help.\u201d</p><p>We all snicker, and it doesn\u2019t matter that Constance regards us with puzzlement. Each of us brings our own gifts to the mix. We stand together, or we fall. I get that now.</p> <p>Once the chatter dies down, I cross to where Jael sits, slightly apart from the others. I drop down beside him. \u201cWhat were you trying to tell me? On the skiff?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head with a bittersweet half smile. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. The moment\u2019s passed.\u201d</p><p>What did he think he needed to apologize for?</p><p>Before I can question him, Hit announces, \u201cPlanetfall in fifteen minutes, so bundle up in your winter clothes and strap in.\u201d</p><p>Four planets in eight days.</p><p>For the first time, I don\u2019t envy someone else the nav chair. If I were sitting up there, I\u2019d be dead. I know it. I need to rest and recuperate while taking my daily injections, or I may never see grimspace again. And while the hunger hasn\u2019t lessened\u2014I still long to jump like I want nothing else in this world besides March\u2014my ability to tune it out has improved.</p><p>I feel drunk with remembered wonder. First glimpse of the sun rising over the glaciers on Ielos, sunset at the Freeport falls, and an afternoon walk along the famed Avenida de Marquez on Axis V, where the bloodshed began so long ago. I tread along the paths where my predecessor Karl Fitzwilliam made his infamous missteps.</p><p>So many people waved and cheered when the convoy passed by, as if I deserved those accolades. What have I ever done to earn them? I\u2019ve touched history this last week, seen and smelled it. Perhaps I\u2019m even becoming part of it in ways I can\u2019t comprehend. I imagine it like threads of a tapestry woven together with such expertise that I can\u2019t see the separate pieces anymore.</p> <p>Whole worlds fade like that beneath me. The towns become patchwork textures and then blur into misty colors. Finally, I can no longer see the people who believe in me, who seem to think I can step into the breach and persuade the Ithtorians to side with us in the coming war.</p><p>Because, make no mistake, I\u2019ve seen the bodies in the first skirmish. Now more than ever, the Morgut see us as prey. And the only thing that might give them pause is an alliance with Ithiss-Tor.</p><p>I\u2019m not ready. I don\u2019t know enough. I\u2019m terrified I\u2019ll fuck this up, and humanity everywhere will pay the price. Maybe my mother\u2019s still banking on that, and that\u2019s another thorn in my side.</p><p>But I\u2019ll step up.</p><p>My gut gurgles as if in answer. I\u2019m bloated from heavy food, eaten at too many parties. And my right hand hurts from all the meet-and-greets. I wore the right clothes and smiled for the press, dandled unfortunate children on my knee, and played a politician for the vids. That was the easy part.</p><p>Now the last stop on our tour recedes beneath me. Seeing so many worlds rouses an odd sensation; I\u2019d call it wanderlust, but it\u2019s more like a fierce need to move on, because I don\u2019t have anywhere like these folks do.</p><p>Whatever its faults, they have somewhere they call their own. One they\u2019d fight for, die for. Home.</p><p>I don\u2019t put down roots. I live for the next jump, even though the next might be my last. How did somebody like me wind up in charge of something so important?</p><p>A disembodied voice tells me, \u201cFive minutes to jump.\u201d</p><p>Once it would\u2019ve bothered me to strap in with everyone else, but today I have far too much on my mind to make room for something so minor. I make my way to the hub and take a seat next to Vel, but this time I strap in without assistance. I\u2019m an expert passenger now.</p><p>\u201cAfterward,\u201d he says in lieu of greeting, \u201cwe have work to do.\u201d</p><p>Damn right. Constance doesn\u2019t ever let up on the customs\u2014I half suspect she recites the list to me in my sleep\u2014but I need to know the rest. By the time we reach Ithiss-Tor, I need to be the foremost human expert in native customs.</p><p>I nod. \u201cI\u2019d like to start with religion.\u201d</p><p>I give my safety gear one last tug. The helmet feels strange, but as the ship trembles, it can\u2019t block out my awareness of the beacons entirely. As if through a veil of water, I feel the jumper scanning grimspace. She\u2019s better than the Syndicate navigator, more confident, and she takes us right there.</p><p>My skin prickles, the hair standing up on the back of my neck. Though I can\u2019t see what she sees, the wildfire and the glorious, cascading colors pouring over the hull, I sense it. Grimspace runs through my blood and bones, boiling inside my cells. What that means, I can\u2019t begin to guess.</p><p>But a tiny part of me withers and dies when we make the jump back. Yearning sears me like a live wire. I wish I could stay there, utterly unfettered.</p><p>Beside me, Vel unbuckles and holds out a hand. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>It takes me another moment to get out of the chair, and then I accept his help. If only things come this easy on Ithiss-Tor. But I know better. He\u2019s warned me about the reception I\u2019ll receive\u2014and given the shame of his profession, they won\u2019t be ecstatic to see him either. I just count us lucky to have gained their initial agreement to take the matter under advisement and permit the arrival of our delegation.</p><p>Ten minutes later, we settle in my quarters. The room is a little larger than the space I enjoyed when I worked for the Corp, but nothing like Keller offered on the Syndicate yacht. I guess piracy doesn\u2019t pay quite as well as being a crime lord.</p><p>\u201cI am going to molt,\u201d Vel warns me. \u201cIf you are to function on my homeworld, you must accustom yourself to the way we look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I\u2019m used to you.\u201d I hope that\u2019s not an overstatement.</p><p>But there are no surprises this time when his faux-human skin drops away. A boxy little cleaning bot activates and whirs into action at his feet, but I don\u2019t break eye contact. I\u2019m not uncomfortable gazing into his faceted eyes. He\u2019s still Velith, the person who\u2019s saved my ass more times than I can count.</p><p>Maybe I can do this after all.</p><p>\u201cReligion,\u201d he says. \u201cWe revere something called the Iglogth. Not God as you understand it, but rather vitality that gives life to everything in the universe. My people believe everything is cyclical, and that the spark which makes you unique returns to the Iglogth, only to be reused at a later time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of like reincarnation?\u201d Primitive humans put faith in that, before we proved the soul doesn\u2019t exist. When I remember everyone I\u2019ve lost, my father foremost among them, I wish that wasn\u2019t true. I wish I believed we might be together again. I left too many words unsaid.</p><p>His mandible moves, clicking sounds result, and then his vocalizer translates. It\u2019s funny how much I miss beneath that false skin. \u201cIn a manner of speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else I should know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly as relates to death customs,\u201d Vel answers. \u201cWe burn our dead and scatter the ashes to the four winds in a formal ceremony. It symbolizes the return of the spirit to the great Iglogth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo other religious rituals?\u201d</p><p>He turns his head from side to side, a learned human gesture for the negative. It sits strangely on his alien face.</p><p>\u201cMoving on then.\u201d</p><p>We work for hours, covering art, architecture, and world history. By the time Constance interrupts us\u2014what a PA, she even reminds me to eat\u2014my head feels like an overripe melon. If there\u2019s another human being who knows more about Ithtorian physiology, mating habits, or customs, well\u2014the Conglomerate should\u2019ve hired him. Because I don\u2019t think I can learn another fact before we put down. I eat with one hand and rub my temples with the other.</p><p>Vel watches me, his side-set eyes studying me with what I take to be concern. \u201cAre you well, Sirantha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019ll be enough. I can\u2019t do more, but what if\u2014\u201d No, I won\u2019t give my fears credence by speaking them aloud. I\u2019ll bear this by myself. \u201cCan you work with Constance and download everything we\u2019ve talked about to her database? That way, if I\u2019m about to make a dire mistake, she can nudge me or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I believe I can.\u201d</p><p>I need insurance, but that\u2019s the best I can do. Shortly thereafter, the bounty hunter and the droid head for his quarters to fulfill my request. I appreciate that, too; I\u2019m sure Vel sensed I need some time alone.</p><p>For at least an hour, I wander the ship, trying to calm my ragged nerves. Fear threatens to choke me from the inside out. If I fuck up here, the whole civilized world will suffer. The Conglomerate needs an alliance with Ithiss-Tor\u2014a rebuff at this juncture would be catastrophic. I battle back my doubt, shove it into the dark place where it can\u2019t touch my conscious mind. It will return in the form of nightmares, but I can pay the cost later.</p><p>If it lets me function, do what I need to do, then that\u2019s enough. I wind up in the observation lounge, where the wall has been replaced with a cunning electronic screen that mirrors what\u2019s right outside the ship. It mirrors a window, down to the last shimmer of smoky glass.</p><p>Even before they make the announcement, I recognize Ithiss-Tor beneath us. From up here, it\u2019s a beautiful world, all pale whorls and dark curls that must be land. My fists clench.</p><p>I can\u2019t do this without you, love. But March is shut away in his quarters, fighting his own demons, so I can\u2019t lean.
