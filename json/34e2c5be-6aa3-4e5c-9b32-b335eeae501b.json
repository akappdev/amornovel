The music and drunken laughter that swelled every time the front door opened didn\u2019t surprise him. But those curtains did.</p><p>Hard to imagine a bunch of frat boys out shopping for them. Choosing the right decorative curtain rods. Finding fabric of a pleasing look and texture. Damned if it didn\u2019t look like it was floral. He would\u2019ve thought bent, dusty blinds would be more their style.</p><p>A faint breeze ruffled his hair.</p> <p>If he concentrated, he could read the thoughts of everyone partying within. Not much there really. Just sex and a determination to get blitzed. And one poor guy who thought he had flunked his biology final. A quick scan of his memories confirmed that he had.</p><p>Etienne sighed. Things had been slow of late. Dare he say boring?</p><p>For a while there, vampires had roamed in such large packs that he and his sister, Lisette, had had to hunt together just to ensure they would survive the battles. But now . . .</p><p>The frat house door burst open as a woman stumbled out.</p><p>Booming bass swelled and pulsed through the night as a tall, broad-shouldered figure stepped into the doorway behind her and held the door open. \u201cCome on. Are you sure I can\u2019t talk you into staying?\u201d the man\u2014twenty-one or twenty-two years of age\u2014asked.</p> <p>The woman staggered to the edge of the porch and tripped down the steps. Low, sultry, feminine laughter wafted up to Etienne.</p><p>Nice. If the woman weren\u2019t sloppy drunk he might find her appealing.</p><p>\u201cYou know me,\u201d she slurred. \u201cPlaces to see and people to go.\u201d</p><p>Her friend laughed.</p><p>Odd. It was late May. Nighttime temperatures in North Carolina had been mild, in the sixties perhaps. Yet the woman wore a long, black coat not unlike the one he sported himself.</p><p>His own concealed a small arsenal of weapons: katanas, daggers, throwing stars, and autoinjectors Dr. Lipton had prepared that bore the only sedative that worked on vampires and immortals.</p> <p>Hers was pretty formfitting. And fit a lovely form. She was slender, perhaps five foot five, with long, black hair that concealed her face as she fought to keep her balance.</p><p>The college boy grinned. \u201cHey, maybe I should walk you home.\u201d</p><p>Again she laughed. \u201cWho says I\u2019m going home?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t a Goth. The style of the coat was wrong and her hair was naturally black. Or perhaps a dark brown. While he could see as clearly as a cat in dim or even no light, he sometimes had difficulty discerning color in those conditions.</p><p>The woman finally succeeded in planting both boots firmly on the pavement and straightened. Combing a hand through her hair, she drew the tangled locks back and gazed up at the moon.</p><p>Etienne\u2019s breath caught. She was beautiful, with porcelain skin, her features pert perfection.</p><p>And she seemed to be looking right at him.</p><p>She even froze for a moment.</p> <p>Impossible. There were no lights up here and he stood in the shadow of a chimney where the moon\u2019s beams wouldn\u2019t touch him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Krysta!\u201d someone called.</p><p>She looked to her left.</p><p>Three more college boys, who clearly had already been celebrating the end of the spring semester, approached the frat house, trampling grass strewn with the occasional empty beer can.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t leaving, are you?\u201d a jovial blond asked.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re just getting here!\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, swayed a bit, then pointed at them. \u201cYour loss, knuckleheads.\u201d</p><p>All laughed.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you just stay for one game of beer pong?\u201d the blond asked hopefully. \u201cOr maybe to shoot some pool? I need to win my twenty bucks back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready spent it,\u201d she called merrily. \u201cSee ya!\u201d She waved, nearly losing her balance again. Stumbling to one side, she threw her arms out as though she were on the deck of a rocking ship, listing one way then the other. When she didn\u2019t fall, she grinned big and threw her hands up in the air like an Olympic gymnast finishing a routine.</p><p>The men all clapped, whistled, and cheered.</p><p>Laughing in delight, she staggered down the sidewalk, turned, and headed up the street.</p><p>\u201cYou think we should walk her home?\u201d the blond asked softly.</p><p>The brunet beside him leered after Krysta. \u201cI\u2019ll walk her home. I\u2019ll walk her alllllll the way home.\u201d</p><p>The blond shoved him. \u201cCut the shit. She isn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>Etienne decided he liked the blond.</p><p>The brunet scowled. \u201cWhatever.\u201d Loping up the steps, he entered the house.</p><p>The blond frowned after Krysta, then\u2014urged on by his other buddy\u2014joined the party.</p><p>Etienne watched Krysta pause under a streetlight, part her coat, and reach into an inner pocket.</p><p>Beneath, she wore tight, black pants that showed every shapely curve of her long legs and a black T-shirt that hugged small, firm breasts.</p><p>Etienne had always been a sucker for women with athletic builds.</p><p>Out came an iPod touch. She conquered her inebriation long enough to tuck earbuds into her ears, but the battery must have run down because she swore and tucked everything back into her pocket.</p><p>Etienne rose.</p><p>That pause had cost her.</p><p>Dark figures slithered from the shadows on either side of the frat house and followed her as she resumed her trek uphill.</p><p>Etienne leapt nimbly to the next roof, careful not to make any sound that would alert the vampires to his presence.</p><p>He counted four and monitored their progress as they slunk from shadow to shadow, dogging the woman\u2019s wobbly footsteps.</p><p>Krysta began to sing, utterly oblivious to the creatures who stalked her.</p><p>Unfamiliar with the song, Etienne assumed it was one of the latest pop hits. His lips twitched as he leapt to the next roof. She was having a hell of a time remembering the lyrics. Or the right notes. Krysta couldn\u2019t carry a tune. And he was pretty sure it wasn\u2019t the alcohol.</p><p>She came to a corner and halted. A look of confusion flitted across her pretty features as she squinted up at the street sign.</p><p>Etienne froze, careful to ensure no light touched him.</p><p>Had her gaze flitted from the sign up to him?</p><p>No. She was looking all around like she either didn\u2019t know where she was or couldn\u2019t remember where she intended to go.</p><p>The vampires slunk farther into the shadows mere moments before she glanced in their direction.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cI think . . .\u201d She spun in a circle. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>She crossed the deserted street, passed Bastien\u2019s building, and . . . entered a dark alley. Really? Had she no sense of self-preservation?</p><p>Etienne drew his katanas as the vampires flowed into the alley behind her like a black tide. Their thoughts\u2014a writhing mass of madness, violence, and anticipation\u2014struck him like poisoned arrows.</p><p>Being telepathic could really suck sometimes.</p><p>He frowned, only then realizing he hadn\u2019t heard any of Krysta\u2019s thoughts. As he watched her stumble toward the end of the alley, not yet noticing that her path would soon be blocked by a tall chain-link fence, he focused on her tipsy head and . . . heard nothing.</p><p>Very unusual. He could count on one hand the number of humans he had encountered in his two centuries of existence who could block, intentionally or not, his entrance into their minds.</p><p>She halted.</p><p>The vamps spread out across the alley, facing her. Light from the street distended and distorted the shadows at their feet, making it seem almost as though they reached for her ankles.</p><p>Etienne stepped to the edge of the roof, preparing to drop down and save Krysta\u2019s attractive, but flighty ass, then . . .</p><p>She ceased swaying. Her shoulders straightened.</p><p>Spinning around, she offered the menacing foursome a cool, measuring stare.</p><p>Etienne frowned.</p><p>The vampires boasted no weapons. Yet. But their eyes glowed and their lips parted to expose long, glinting fangs. She should be screaming her head off. Instead . . .</p><p>\u201cFinally,\u201d she pronounced with a healthy dose of exasperation. \u201cIt took you guys long enough. I mean, did you really have to make me walk up that damned hill?\u201d</p><p>What. The. Hell?</p><p>Krysta shifted, balancing her weight lightly on the balls of her feet as the vampires exchanged puzzled looks. There were four of them. Four would be a challenge. Okay, more than a challenge. Way more. She had had her ass handed to her more than once in the past couple of years when trying to combat such numbers on her own. But, until they actually closed in, she was often unable to tell just how many had taken the bait and followed her.</p><p>Sneakers shuffled on dirty asphalt.</p><p>These seemed to be typical examples of the vampires\u2019 ilk. Young. Twenties or thereabouts. Could blend in easily on a college campus if you disregarded the brilliantly glowing eyes and fangs. Hopefully they hadn\u2019t been vampires for very long. The older they were, the more insane they were. At least that was how she thought it worked. And the deeper they descended into madness, the harder they were to defeat. Krysta didn\u2019t have their speed. Or strength. Or size and weight. But she did have two things they didn\u2019t.</p><p>The first was skill. She had spent years training in tae kwon do, karate, and jiujitsu, and had trained with weapons long enough to kick ass. Most vampires had spent a majority of the time, prior to their transformation, sitting on their asses and either texting, yakking on the phone, surfing the Internet, or playing video games. That didn\u2019t lend them much skill with knives and swords, so she didn\u2019t really understand why they carried them. They were vampires. They could disarm a human easily and, if they didn\u2019t, could survive a bullet wound, so what was the deal with that? As far as Krysta knew, she was the only vampire hunter in existence. She seriously doubted her reputation preceded her.</p><p>The orange glow around the vampires moved and shifted as the not-very-bright predators tried to figure out why she wasn\u2019t fleeing in terror.</p><p>And that was her second advantage. She could see auras. Until she had begun to hunt vampires, she had never thought much of the ability. It warned her of people\u2019s moods, so she could turn and walk the other way if someone was pissed about something and she didn\u2019t want to hear it. Big whoop. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then her life had changed dramatically, and she had actually found a use for her talent.</p><p>Vampires were incredibly fast. Like as fast as The Flash. Their movements became blurry and indistinct when they moved at top speeds. But their auras behaved very differently than those of humans. Vampires\u2019 auras moved and shifted before they did, telling her exactly where they intended to go before they even took a step.</p><p>Krysta eyed the vamps before her, waiting for the telltale shift in auras that would precede their attack.</p> <p>\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of us?\u201d one asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Should I be?\u201d</p><p>Looks were exchanged.</p><p>\u201cYeah, ya dumb bitch,\u201d another proclaimed. \u201cWe\u2019re vampires!\u201d</p><p>So polite. She slid a hand into her coat and grasped the handle of one of the shoto swords she carried, ready to teach him some manners. \u201cYeah, and?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat, are you a second?\u201d</p><p>She fought a frown. He wasn\u2019t the first vampire who had asked her that. What the hell was a second? A second what?</p><p>\u201cFuck this. Let\u2019s kick her ass!\u201d a third cried.</p><p>The aura of the one closest to her shifted. Krysta drew her sword and swung it, the blade sinking into flesh as the vampire blurred and caught up with the orange glow.</p><p>Krysta drew her other sword.</p><p>The three remaining vampires gaped as the severed head of their companion hit the ground and rolled several feet away from the body that tumbled after it.</p> <p>The first kill was always the easiest.</p><p>The vampires\u2019 faces contorted with fury. Growls and snarls erupted. Eyes glowed brighter.</p><p>Crap. Here we go.</p><p>Orange auras deepened in color and shot forward just before the vampires\u2019 forms all blurred.</p><p>Krysta swung both swords with as much speed and strength as she possessed. Her heart raced. Adrenaline surged through her veins. Her blades sank into her opponents.</p><p>When warm blood slapped her in the face, she clamped her lips shut. No way did she want any of that getting into her mouth. She didn\u2019t know exactly how one became a vampire, but figured it probably had something to do with the blood.</p><p>One of the vamps landed a blow to her back that sent pain careening through her as she flew forward and hit the ground.</p><p>Rolling, she came up swinging as the vamps converged on her. The momentum of one came to her aid and made a hit that normally would have just cut him instead sever his arm. Vamps tended to not recover from such severe wounds, bleeding out faster than they could heal. As this one did, stumbling backward and falling to the ground while he fought to staunch the crimson river flowing onto the pavement around him.</p> <p>The vampires divided, attacking from opposite sides.</p><p>Krysta continued to wield her deadly shotos, creating a barrier as formidable as a rotary fan\u2019s blades. Cuts opened on the vampires, who became manic in their fury, slavering like rabid dogs.</p><p>Fear a constant companion, she delivered a round-house kick to the vamp behind her. Agony shot up her leg. It was like kicking a damned boulder. But at least it had kept him from diving low and biting her leg as his aura had warned her he intended.</p><p>She landed several more slashes before silver glinted in their hands.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>Needlelike pain erupted in her arms, sides, and back as they cut her.</p><p>Time to take a huge risk.</p><p>Ignoring the vampire behind her, she focused all of her attention on the one in front of her. The next time his aura shifted, she swung with all of her might.</p><p>The vampire\u2019s eyes widened. Stumbling back, he raised both hands to the throat her sword had laid open. The gray shirt he wore turned red as blood spilled down his chest and saturated it.</p><p>Spinning around, she raised her weapons. The last vamp, who should have been all over her after the opening she\u2019d given him, stared at her stupidly and stumbled back a step.</p><p>She frowned.</p><p>He grunted. And grunted again. Blood spilled from his lips.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Groaning, he sank to his knees and clumsily tried to reach behind him with both hands.</p><p>Was this a trick?</p><p>Swords at the ready, she limped forward and began to edge around him to see what the hell he was reaching for.</p><p>Krysta stopped and stared. Half a dozen daggers protruded from his back. And, judging by their positions, they had pierced his heart and probably sliced through at least one major artery.</p><p>A whole new fear invaded her as she backed away, her gaze darting all around her and seeking the source of those weapons.</p><p>A sound drew her attention to the entrance of the alley.</p><p>Ice skittered through her.</p><p>Seven vampires. Eyes glowing various shades of blue, green, silver, and amber.</p><p>I\u2019m dead. The panicked thought barreled through her brain at light speed. There\u2019s no way I\u2019ll survive this.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a second!\u201d one snarled.</p><p>What the hell is a second?</p><p>Their glowing orange auras zipped toward her.</p><p>Kysta swung and thrust as she backed away toward the chain-link fence. But, even as she scored hits, the vampires flew past to circle around and cut her off.</p><p>A thud sounded behind her. The vamps in front of her paused to look over her shoulder. Something bumped her back.</p><p>Krysta spun around and swung.</p><p>A large hand clamped around her wrist, stopping her with infuriating ease.</p><p>Her gaze rose, taking in the tall figure garbed all in black who towered over her. His luminescent amber eyes, as bright as the moon, met hers. His lips parted, exposing deadly fangs.</p><p>But his aura . . .</p><p>It wasn\u2019t orange like the other vampires\u2019. It was bright white and purple, the two colors swirling together without ever mixing. She had never seen anything like it.</p><p>Or had she?</p><p>Hadn\u2019t she seen it up on the roof earlier and dismissed it as a trick of the eye?</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she breathed, and waited for him to strike a death blow.</p><p>Etienne frowned.</p><p>She knew him?</p><p>He released her arm, ready to catch it again if she should try to skewer him.</p><p>The vamps behind her decided to take advantage of her inattention and zipped forward.</p><p>Quick as lightning, Etienne drew four throwing stars and threw them. Two struck carotid arteries.</p><p>Krysta\u2019s eyes widened as blood splattered her back.</p><p>\u201cYou started this,\u201d he said. As soon as this was over, he intended to reprimand the hell out of her for stepping outside the bounds of her duties. She must be a new Second. Reordon usually made it clear that the human guards who aided immortals were not to strike out and hunt vampires on their own unless they suspected their immortal had been captured and, for some reason, couldn\u2019t reach anyone at the network for help. \u201cNow let\u2019s finish it together. I\u2019ll watch your back.\u201d</p><p>Turning his own back, he drew his katanas and tore into the four vamps who had circled around to attack her from the rear.</p><p>Bloody bastards had no honor. Attacking a woman\u2014a human woman at that\u2014from behind.</p><p>Battle sounds erupted over his shoulder. Etienne listened closely for any sound that might indicate Krysta wasn\u2019t holding her own, still astonished by the skill she had displayed thus far.</p><p>The last of the four vampires he fought fell.</p><p>Etienne swung around. Three still remained. Krysta had managed to keep them at bay, but had struck no more killing blows. She was tiring. Fending off blows backed by supernatural strength tended to do that to a human.</p><p>Etienne stepped up beside her, careful to avoid her swords, and dove into the fight.</p><p>The vamps immediately turned away from her to defend themselves, but didn\u2019t succeed. Etienne opened the arteries of two, who fell to the ground. The last vampire opted to abandon his dying comrades, some of whom had already begun to shrivel up like mummies as the virus that infected them devoured them from the inside out in a desperate bid to live. The vamp\u2019s crimson-stained form blurred as he darted toward the street.</p><p>Etienne caught him easily at the mouth of the alley, yanked him back into the shadows, and swiftly dispatched him.</p><p>When he turned around, Krysta had sheathed one of her swords and was texting away on a cell phone.</p><p>He strolled toward her.</p><p>Head jerking up, she pocketed the phone and drew her other sword.</p><p>He frowned. She watched him as though she expected him to attack her.</p><p>\u201cHow badly are you hurt?\u201d he asked. Surely she could tell friend from foe. Even Sheldon, his brother Richart\u2019s notoriously green Second, could do that much.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she lied, chin rising. Her clothing sported a dozen or more cuts and tears. She also rested most of her weight on one leg and limped when she moved. Like now, as she inched backward at his approach.</p><p>Etienne stopped several feet away from her.</p><p>She feared him. He could both smell it and see it in the dilation of her warm, brown eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou are a Second, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat is a Second?\u201d she practically shouted.</p><p>Ah, hell. This was a problem. She was a civilian?</p><p>He should call Chris Reordon, the head of the East Coast division of the human network that aided immortals. But Etienne couldn\u2019t bring himself to do so. This mortal woman had just hunted and defeated four vampires on her own. And she hadn\u2019t broken down when facing almost certain death. He found that damned appealing and worried over what Chris might do to her to ensure her silence and cooperation. He hadn\u2019t had much hands-on contact with the human network until recently, but had heard Chris could be ruthless when it came to protecting the identities and ensuring the safety of the Immortal Guardians.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d she demanded and began to edge around him, giving him a wide berth.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould I ask if I did?\u201d she countered. \u201cYou\u2019re different from them.\u201d She motioned to the deceased vampires, a couple of whom were only piles of empty clothing now.</p><p>Etienne studied her closely. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t kill you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her eyes roving him as if she could see a difference.</p><p>\u201cYou seemed to know me, when I joined the battle. Do you?\u201d</p><p>She inched toward the entrance of the alley.</p><p>Etienne didn\u2019t follow. He could catch her easily if she should decide to run and he didn\u2019t want to frighten her any more than he already had. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI saw you,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the roof of the building across from the frat house.

Fortunately most drivers were so busy chatting or texting that they wouldn\u2019t notice anything peculiar taking place in the alleyways they passed.</p> <p>\u201cPut your swords away and let us discuss this,\u201d he suggested reasonably. He needed to keep her talking while he decided what to do about this, whether to call Reordon or . . .</p><p>Well, he didn\u2019t know what else.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she responded. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve nothing to fear from me. I just saved your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you could take it yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said with the same exasperation he had heard in her voice earlier.</p> <p>\u201cSo you could turn me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d</p><p>Her frown deepened. Perhaps she had finally identified the sincerity in his voice.</p><p>A somewhat battered economy car screeched to a halt behind her. The driver leaned over and thrust open the passenger door.</p><p>Krysta backed into it, never taking her eyes from him. Sitting down with swords still at the ready, she swung her feet into the car. \u201cDon\u2019t follow me.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she lowered her blades, the car shot forward out of sight, her door slamming shut from the momentum.</p><p>Merde. He hadn\u2019t expected that.</p><p>Gritting her teeth, Krysta turned around and stared through the back window.</p> <p>\u201cWho the hell was that?\u201d her brother demanded, barely tapping the breaks as he turned the corner and began a roundabout, wild-ass ride in the general direction of their home.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis eyes glowed. He was a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what he was. Is. He looks like a vampire, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the door handle and hung on as Sean skidded around another corner. He had all of the talents of a freaking stunt driver. And that had come in handy. Not once had a vampire managed to follow them all the way home.</p><p>\u201cHis aura is different,\u201d she told him. \u201cWay different. And . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe saved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit. He didn\u2019t bite you, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She faced forward and slumped back in her seat, wounds throbbing. \u201cThere were four vampires this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it! I told you to stick to one or two!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know there were going to be that many!\u201d she defended herself. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I can stop, look back, and take a head count. That would kinda spoil the whole Victim Here deception.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cFour? How did you even\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took out three.\u201d She began to shake as reaction set in. \u201cBut I had to leave myself wide open for the fourth in order to take out the third and, when I turned around, there were half a dozen daggers sticking out of his back.\u201d</p><p>Sean shot her a disbelieving look. \u201cAre you saying the vampire in the alley who was dressed like Johnny Cash killed him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim and the seven vampires who showed up next.\u201d</p><p>Epithets filled the little car, full of force and fear and determination. \u201cThat\u2019s it. No more. This is over. You\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it was one or two, that was one thing. You could handle it. But for the past couple of years it\u2019s been insane. You\u2019ve nearly died too many times to count and I\u2019m not ready to lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just have to be more careful\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been singing that bullshit song for months now. No more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t do it, who will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet that crazy-ass vamp from the alley do it if that\u2019s his madness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t seem mad,\u201d she murmured, still puzzling over it. She had never met a vampire who was nice, for lack of a better word.</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason to let him hunt his fellow bloodsuckers. If they slice him up, he\u2019ll heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always manage to patch me up.\u201d</p><p>Not without cost on his part. That had always filled her with guilt and regret, but she didn\u2019t see any way around it. She couldn\u2019t do this without him.</p><p>\u201cThere are some things I can\u2019t do, Krysta. I have limits. When I reach those and you have to bury me, will it have been worth it?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t bear the thought of it. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to find another way.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, alerting her to the huge argument ahead of them, and glanced in the rearview mirror. \u201cIs it clear?\u201d</p><p>She turned around and peered through the back window once more. The rest of the car may be coated in dirt and look like crap, but the windows were always sparklingly clean. Their lives depended upon it.</p><p>No bright orange glows streaked toward them in the street, so no vampires tailed them. Or no regular vampires tailed them. She didn\u2019t see any purple either. She thought she saw a glint of white, but it was so fleeting she decided it was the moonlight shining on a storefront window.</p><p>Turning around, she studied the scenery that whipped past through the passenger window. \u201cIt\u2019s clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His meandering path ended as he headed straight for the small frame house they rented on the outskirts of Carrboro, North Carolina. \u201cHow badly are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think my leg is broken, but it hurts like hell. And I\u2019m bleeding from a lot of cuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo major arteries hit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo ribs broken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time. That vamp really saved my ass.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head again and took his foot off the gas.</p><p>Krysta checked behind them as the car slowed, just to be doubly sure, then nodded.</p><p>Sean guided the car onto a drive that was supposed to be gravel, but was about eighty percent dirt and weeds instead.</p><p>Krysta\u2019s sore, aching body wobbled from side to side as he navigated the pothole-riddled path about fifty yards to the little, brown frame house hidden among the trees.</p><p>They had tried to find a place in Chapel Hill, so they would be closer to the colleges (prime hunting grounds for vampires), but hadn\u2019t been able to afford it. This had ended up being ideal in terms of isolation anyway. No neighbors. No one to see her blood-painted face and clothing when they returned home. No one to call the police if they glimpsed her weapons.</p><p>Sean parked and, unfolding his large form, circled around to help Krysta.</p><p>He was a lot taller than she was, taking after their father, who towered over their tiny mother. Krysta stood at only five foot five and boasted a slender build with enough muscle to lend her strength without bulking her up like a man. Sean was six foot two or thereabouts and packed about two hundred pounds of muscle that made many a woman drool. He also possessed the same fighting skills Krysta did. Had he been able to anticipate the vampires\u2019 moves the way she could, they would have made a formidable team.</p><p>Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t. And the few times he had joined her on the hunt, he had ended up so battered and bloody she had almost had to take him to the hospital.</p><p>Krysta kept her swords in hand as he opened the car door, reached in, and practically lifted her out. \u201cI can walk,\u201d she insisted, though her leg was really hurting. Maybe the bastard had fractured it. Could one walk on a fractured leg?</p><p>Sean mumbled something about stubbornness bordering on stupidity and wrapped a supportive arm around her to help her to the door.</p><p>Krysta let the slur slide. She knew he was just worried about her and terrified of losing her. His mood always turned sour when she was wounded, which happened pretty much every time she hunted. She\u2019d avoid it if she could. She sure as hell didn\u2019t enjoy it. But, how?</p><p>There was no need to flip through keys to open the front door. They always left it unlocked. The house was hidden from the road by trees and drew no notice of passersby. Even the mailman didn\u2019t deliver. All of their correspondence went to a post office box.</p><p>And if someone did choose to wander down their drive and found the frame house, nothing about its appearance would entice a burglar. It was over a century old and built on uneven ground that left it slanting to one side. (She and Sean had had a hell of a time leveling the furniture when they had moved in.) The roof sagged, as did the porch and back deck. The paint was old and worn and peeling.</p><p>Who would even bother to look inside?</p><p>\u201cYou need to mow the lawn,\u201d she huffed, gritting her teeth against the pain as they trudged over uneven ground, up the steps, and through the door.</p><p>They also left it unlocked for expediency\u2019s sake. There had been nights when time had been of the essence.</p><p>\u201cGround\u2019s still too wet.\u201d He flicked a switch, and bright light flooded the small living room.</p><p>Krysta limped over to the futon and slumped down on the waterproof tarp they always placed over it on nights she hunted. That bright idea had come to them too late to save their first from bloodstains.</p><p>\u201cDo you need help getting your coat off?\u201d he asked, sitting in front of her on their dented and scarred coffee table.</p><p>She nodded. Pulling cloth away from the wounds it stuck to always made the pain worse.</p><p>Sean, tight-lipped and silent, removed her coat as gently as possible.</p><p>Krysta tugged her shirt over her head. Underneath, she wore a heavy-duty sports bra that covered everything. Not one hint of cleavage could be found, not that she had much. And, beneath the pants she removed, she wore bike shorts.</p><p>Sean scowled as he examined her wounds. \u201cThe leg isn\u2019t broken. It\u2019s sprained. I don\u2019t like how these two cuts\u201d\u2014he motioned to one on her shoulder and one on her thigh\u2014\u201care bleeding, so I\u2019ll heal them first.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and rested his hands on his splayed knees. Krysta remained quiet while he breathed in through his nose, held it, then released it several times. Opening his eyes, he covered the wound on her thigh with his hands.</p><p>Warmth flooded her skin. The cut began to tingle as if a numbing agent had been applied. Blood ceased oozing from beneath his fingers. The pain eased.</p> <p>When Sean withdrew his hands, the cut had been replaced by a faint scar. \u201cTurn to the side a bit.\u201d</p><p>She did so, giving him greater access to the wound scoring her shoulder.</p><p>He cupped a hand over it. Again a soothing warmth suffused her wound as it healed beneath his touch. Sean had borne this gift all of his life. Just as she had borne hers. And he had been healing her for as long as she could remember. Though she was two years older than Sean, she couldn\u2019t count the number of times he had stopped her crying in their youth by covering a scraped knee or cut elbow with his little hands and making the wounds disappear.</p><p>Of course, they didn\u2019t actually disappear. Neither of them were sure how exactly it worked, but he seemed to transfer the wound to his own body, which healed at an accelerated rate. Even now, a red stain appeared on the shoulder of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll heal the leg now before I heal the others.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe others aren\u2019t bad,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI can just use some butterfly closures on them.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. With careful hands, he lifted her foot and propped it next to him on the coffee table. \u201cDo we really have to do this every time?\u201d He settled his hands on her shin where it hurt the most. A muscle in his jaw jumped as he clenched his teeth.</p><p>She hated causing him pain. That was the worst part of all of this. Not the vampires trying to kill her. Or having to hide what she did from everyone so they wouldn\u2019t think she was crazy and commit her. But the pain Sean experienced when he healed her time and time again, saving her ass so she could go out and do the same thing again tomorrow.</p><p>The pain in her leg vanished. And she knew Sean would limp if he were to stand and try to walk now. But he didn\u2019t. He stubbornly healed every cut and bruise on her arms and legs and back.</p><p>She hugged him gingerly when he finished, knowing he now ached in all of the places she had. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He patted her back, then shifted over to slump down on the futon.</p> <p>Healing her didn\u2019t just open wounds on him. It also exhausted him.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cHow long are we going to do this, Krys?\u201d</p><p>She slumped back beside him. \u201cI don\u2019t know. As long as it takes, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTakes to do what? For a while there, it seemed like we were making a difference. The vampires\u2019 numbers decreased. You\u2019d go weeks sometimes without running into one. But eleven in one night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve, if you count the . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? The good one?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s turning into a never-ending battle. We can\u2019t win this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can we stop?\u201d</p><p>Another deep sigh soughed from him. Raising a hand, he rubbed his eyes and shook his head.</p><p>She understood his weariness. Some may have counted tonight a victory. But she and Sean could see it only as defeat, as proof that they would never succeed in ridding the world of every bloodsucker on the planet.</p><p>It was a war they couldn\u2019t win.</p><p>And sooner or later it would kill them.</p><p>Etienne stood in the small frame home, staring down at Krysta. Darkness surrounded them, broken only by the glowing red digits on her alarm clock.</p><p>She slept the sleep of the utterly exhausted, curled on her side with a faded, striped sheet tucked beneath her chin. Sean slumbered in the only other bedroom in the house. Both were blissfully unaware that he had invaded the safety of their home. Etienne had gone to great lengths to avoid detection while he had followed them from UNC.</p><p>Taking his time, he inspected the interior of the house. It reminded him a bit of the one Sarah had been renting when Roland had met her. Small. Old. Tidy. He guessed, by the pictures displayed on the wall, that the two were siblings. Why that was a relief puzzled him. Though he didn\u2019t know them, he hadn\u2019t wanted the two of them to be lovers. It made no sense.</p><p>He returned silently to Krysta\u2019s bedroom, a task made more difficult by the many squeaky floorboards.</p><p>The conversation he had overheard earlier led him to believe that hunting vampires was not a new endeavor for her. How the hell had she gone undetected? There were over a dozen immortals in the area. Seth, their leader and the most powerful among them, had been dropping in regularly. Seconds and cleaners abounded. And the network headquarters was stationed in Greensboro. Yet none of them had ever encountered Krysta? It seemed rather remarkable.</p><p>Rustling sounded in the next room. Etienne melted back into the darkest corner as Sean shuffled past the doorway in boxer shorts and a T-shirt. Moments later the door to the bathroom closed and Etienne returned his attention to the warrior woman slumbering so peacefully a few feet away.</p><p>She would have to be dealt with.</p><p>Both of them would.</p><p>When Sean next passed by his sister\u2019s bedroom, Etienne was gone.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Sebastien slipped through the front door of David\u2019s home. The amount of time he spent here was ironic, considering how eager he had been to leave this place a couple of months earlier.</p><p>Of course, he hadn\u2019t left under the circumstances he had assumed he would. He had thought he would tell the Immortal Guardians to kiss his ass and either leave and never see them again or fight them to the death. Most likely the latter.</p><p>Instead he had fallen in love with a mortal doctor (who was now immortal), gotten her into all kinds of trouble, then married her and moved into a quaint home in the country.</p><p>Life could be strange as hell sometimes. Who could\u2019ve foreseen that fate for him?</p><p>Well, maybe Seth. That bastard seemed to know almost everything. Very annoying.</p><p>No one called a welcome when Bastien closed the door behind himself. The French immortals\u2014Etienne, Richart, and Lisette\u2014lounged on a couple of sofas along with Richart\u2019s wife, Jenna, watching some movie with a lot of explosions while they snacked on pita chips.</p><p>Lisette barely spared him a glance. Richart nodded. Jenna sent him a tentative smile. Etienne didn\u2019t even seem to notice his presence. Tracy, Lisette\u2019s Second, was on the other side of the living room flirting with a human Bastien thought might be Ethan\u2019s Second. Bastien knew neither the American immortal nor his Second well. Sheldon, Richart\u2019s Second, entered from the kitchen, carrying a pizza the size of a fucking big rig wheel.</p><p>When he caught sight of Bastien, he reverse-nodded. \u201c\u2019Sup?\u201d He stopped short. \u201cDude. What\u2019s the deal with your coat? It\u2019s moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs David here?\u201d Bastien asked, offering no explanation.</p><p>His eyes fastened on Bastien\u2019s coat pockets, Sheldon said, \u201cYeah, he\u2019s in his study.\u201d</p><p>Bastien strode toward the darkened hallway. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>As he reached the entrance to David\u2019s study, he heard Sheldon murmur to Richart, \u201cI think something\u2019s wrong with Bastien. He just thanked me.\u201d</p><p>A sigh escaped him. That was Melanie\u2019s influence.</p><p>Seated at his massive desk, David perused what Bastien assumed was another medical text. As usual, his long dreadlocks were pulled back with a leather tie.</p><p>\u201cGot a minute?\u201d Bastien asked.</p><p>The elder immortal raised his head\u2014and his eyebrows\u2014at the polite query and motioned for him to enter.</p><p>Bastien stepped inside and closed the door behind him, not that it did much good. Unless they were closeted in one of the quiet rooms, any immortal in the house could hear their conversation.</p><p>David was the second eldest immortal in the world and wielded incredible strength and power. Unlike younger immortals, who had only one or two gifts, David possessed several. He was such a powerful healer that he could reattach severed limbs. He could shape-shift, something most of them hadn\u2019t realized until the last big battle they had engaged in with Emrys\u2019s mercenaries. He could also hurl Bastien across the room with a thought. So, though he was perhaps the most even-tempered immortal, it was nevertheless wise not to cross or anger him.</p><p>Bastien had never felt comfortable around David. Melanie didn\u2019t understand why, but it was the same reason she puzzled him herself. David had always been kind to Bastien, welcoming him into his home and defending him when the other immortals had all called for his execution. He had behaved casually and almost like a brother toward Bastien since the moment the two had met.</p><p>Bastien didn\u2019t understand it.</p><p>\u201cThose had better not be for me,\u201d David warned as Bastien approached his desk.</p><p>\u201cActually, they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you off your nut?\u201d</p><p>Bastien laughed. \u201cNo. Read my mind so we can talk without the others listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Can you hear me? Bastien asked mentally. He wasn\u2019t telepathic himself and could only hear the elder\u2019s thoughts if David spoke them in Bastien\u2019s head.</p><p>One moment. Lisette?</p><p>There was a pause. Yes?</p><p>Close your mind to us.</p><p>Bastien hadn\u2019t thought of that. He still wasn\u2019t used to being around the telepaths.</p><p>Done, she responded grudgingly.</p><p>Etienne?</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Etienne, close your mind to us.</p><p>Still nothing.</p><p>Etienne!</p><p>What? Why\u2019d you elbow me?</p><p>Because David is speaking to you, Lisette said. And I only knew that, David, because you were projecting it. I\u2019m out.</p><p>Who did what now? Etienne asked.</p><p>Never mind, David told him, then met Bastien\u2019s gaze. He\u2019s distracted and won\u2019t hear us. Go ahead.</p><p>Reaching into his pockets, Bastien began to withdraw the motherless kittens he had found earlier. They were tiny, eyes barely open, and clumsily scrambled toward each other on David\u2019s desk, forming a squirming, furry pile. I thought these would buy us some time.</p><p>David frowned, but couldn\u2019t resist picking up one of the kittens and stroking it. The white and orange fur stood out starkly next to the elder immortal\u2019s black as midnight skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Buy us time or consume our time? he queried. These need frequent feeding. Where is their mother?</p><p>Hit by a car. And, yes, they need feeding. Every two hours, I think, which will be a pain in the ass. But . . . listen.</p><p>The kittens began to mew as they vied for position in the pile. Beneath those sounds . . .</p> <p>Heartbeats, David said as understanding dawned.</p><p>Until you decide what to tell the others about Ami\u2019s pregnancy, this will help conceal it from them. With these little guys roaming the house, anyone who hears the baby\u2019s heartbeat will assume it\u2019s a kitten\u2019s. Hell, who here has spent enough time around a pregnant woman since transforming to tell the difference?</p><p>True. David set the kitten down next to its brothers and sisters, then picked up a black and white one. Smart thinking. He smiled when the kitten clumsily walked up his arm and sank its claws into one of his long dreadlocks. He caught it before it became too entangled and held it up before his face. He\u2019s cute, isn\u2019t he?</p><p>Bastien smiled. Yeah. I dropped by the pet store and bought cat milk, bottles, and everything else we\u2019ll need. It\u2019s in my car.</p><p>Get it and meet me in the living room.</p> <p>Bastien went to the car and retrieved a large bag of essentials, some of which he was pretty sure weren\u2019t essentials, but the saleslady had been nice and hadn\u2019t shied away from him the way so many humans did. When he returned to the house, David was just entering the living room with all six kittens cradled in his large hands.</p><p>The television shut off.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d several protested and turned toward him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d Sheldon asked, staring at the kittens.</p><p>\u201cYour new assignments.\u201d</p><p>Krysta\u2019s nerves jangled as she strolled through the quiet college campus, adding a stagger here and there for show.</p> <p>She had hunted every night for the past two weeks with nothing to show for it. No vampire attacks. No vampire deaths. No glimpses of the mysterious . . . other. The vampire who had saved her ass.</p><p>Why was his aura so different? He clearly was a vampire. Same fangs. Same glowing eyes. Same incredible speed and strength. Just no orange aura.</p><p>An owl hooted.</p><p>Why had he helped her?</p><p>What was his agenda?</p><p>And why hadn\u2019t she seen him again?</p><p>A nice breeze blew her hair back from her face.</p><p>She was beginning to suspect he had been following her each night as she hunted.</p> <p>Not just following her. Protecting her.</p><p>The notion was insane. As insane as the vampires she loathed so much. And yet, there had been moments when she would have sworn she had drawn out some vampires, just as she had the night she had met Mr. Tall, Dark, and Hot.</p><p>He isn\u2019t hot.</p><p>Yes, he is.</p><p>Damn it, he is.</p><p>Some nights, she had heard faint footsteps behind her and caught glimpses of shadows stalking her. Shadows with flowing orange auras. She had continued her helpless, drunken student act until she was sure, then had turned down this street, into that alley, and . . .</p><p>Found herself alone. Safe. Unassailed.</p><p>It made no sense.</p><p>Last night, she had heard a muffled thump, followed by a metallic clatter as she drew her weapons and spun around to face the vampires she had thought were pursuing her. Once more faced with an empty alleyway, she had hurried forward, rounded the corner, and found a flashy bowie knife\u2014typical vamp weaponry\u2014lying on the sidewalk.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t mentioned it to her brother. If Sean thought the new vampire was stalking her or playing some weird game with her, he would argue like hell to get her to stop hunting.</p><p>And it did seem like a game. She just couldn\u2019t figure out the rules or the why\u2019s of it.</p><p>Her favorite frat house again boomed music. Shadows danced on the curtains.</p><p>Sighing, Krysta headed down the hill toward it.</p><p>She really didn\u2019t feel like being around people right now. Especially drunk, gropey people. But she had a job to do.</p><p>As she approached the sidewalk that led to the porch steps, the shadows on this side of the house shifted minutely. A dark figure with an orange aura slipped around the corner. Another joined it.</p><p>Perfect. She had no interest in making small talk. And being around drunk people was a lot more fun when she was drunk, too.</p><p>Krysta continued past, faking a stumble, and dropped her purse. Mumbling to herself, she scooped it up and staggered to one side. A shake of her head at herself and she headed farther down the hill, where she paused at an intersection.</p><p>Pretending to look both ways allowed her to catch a glimpse of wisps of bright orange behind her.</p><p>Score!</p><p>Finally. A fight. She needed one to clear the cobwebs. To get rid of this frustrated, pent-up energy. To feed her need for vengeance.</p><p>Adrenaline flooded her veins as she crossed the street and turned down a dark, narrow side street. She couldn\u2019t see well in the dark like vampires could, but the vamps\u2019 glowing auras tended to light the field of battle for her.</p><p>A scuffing sound behind her halted her footsteps. Swinging around, she drew her swords with a triumphant smile, and...</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d</p><p>No vampires faced her with leering, evil intent. No vampires faced her at all.</p><p>She was alone. Again.</p><p>More rustling sounded.</p><p>Racing back to the street, she flew around the corner and skidded to a halt.</p><p>Nothing. Just an empty road glowing green from the streetlight at the corner.</p><p>The unmistakable shick, ting, and clang of metal striking metal split the air several blocks away.</p><p>\u201cOh, no you don\u2019t,\u201d she growled and took off running. She didn\u2019t care that she raced down a sharply sloped hill that would make it damned near impossible to stop once she got going. She didn\u2019t care that she ran with an unsheathed sword in each hand. (Her mother and father\u2019s frequent admonitions not to run with scissors chose that moment to dance through her head.) She didn\u2019t even care that anyone who saw her would likely call the police and report a madwoman fleeing through Chapel Hill, waving deadly weapons, and get her arrested.</p><p>She had only one goal in mind: Get to those damned vampires before Mystery Man did whatever the hell he\u2019d been doing for the past two weeks and disappeared.</p><p>Her heart pounding in her chest, she honed in on the battle\u2019s location and managed to put on the brakes enough to zip around the corner at a speed that would keep her from rolling ass over elbows downhill.</p><p>She jerked to a halt and stared.</p><p>The darkened alley was deserted except for a Dumpster about twenty-five yards away and\u2014she released a growl of fury\u2014a pair of jeans, a bloody blue sweatshirt, and a pair of bright red Chucks spread out on the pavement as if they had been laid out by some kid\u2019s mother.</p><p>Krysta sheathed one of her swords, stomped over the place a vampire had clearly fallen, and grabbed the sweatshirt. \u201cOh, come on!\u201d she shouted, her voice echoing on the somnolent night. She shook the sticky clothing at the sky. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d she demanded. Turning in a circle, she examined every nook and cranny at street level, then peered up at the rooftops.</p><p>She could see no sign of Mystery Man\u2019s unique purple and white aura. Had he already left?</p><p>Krysta tossed the shirt down in disgust. \u201cThis is bullshit.\u201d</p><p>A low chuckle wafted on the night.</p><p>Eyes widening, she drew her second sword and turned in a slow circle. \u201cDamn it! Show yourself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, since you asked so nicely,\u201d a deep voice laced with a French accent purred behind her.</p><p>Gasping, she spun around and swung a shoto.</p><p>Once more, he caught her wrist. \u201cCareful.\u201d The warning was gentle, carrying neither malice nor anger.</p><p>Krysta stared.</p><p>His touch sent electricity tickling its way up her arm. His flesh was warm, his long fingers free of calluses.</p><p>Her heart slammed against her ribs as butterflies erupted in her stomach.</p><p>She should be furious. Frightened. Instead, she felt as excited as she would on a first date.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>Stepping back, she withdrew her arm from his grasp.</p><p>Dropping his hand, he tilted his head and studied her with those entrancing amber eyes.</p><p>Yeah, he was hot all right.</p><p>Short, midnight hair glinted in the moonlight. Faint stubble shadowed a strong jaw. Straight nose. Broad shoulders. What was clearly a well-developed, muscular build beneath a black T-shirt that clung to him courtesy of the vampire blood that saturated its front. Slim waist. Slim hips. All revealed by the gap in the long, black coat he wore.</p><p>She didn\u2019t let her gaze stray farther. The last thing she wanted to do while facing him was blush like a schoolgirl if he had a nice package.</p><p>His tempting lips stretched in a slow smile.</p><p>Usually, the minds of mortals were revoltingly easy for Etienne to read. Krysta\u2019s thoughts, for some reason, were proving rather elusive, although he had caught something about his package.</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>Her pretty brown eyes narrowed. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>He performed a gallant bow and offered his hand. \u201cEtienne d\u2019Alen\u00e7on.\u201d</p><p>She raised one eyebrow. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m going to put away my weapons, think again.\u201d</p><p>He had expected no less from this bewitching warrior. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>She motioned to the clothes of the vampire he hadn\u2019t had time to discard. \u201cWhat happened here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what you think happened.\u201d He had taken out the vampires who had fallen for her ruse, damn her and her insistence on putting herself in danger.</p><p>\u201cYou killed a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are the other two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeteriorating on the roof.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze darted to the building beside them, up to the edge of the roof, then returned to him. \u201cYou fought them up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2014what\u2014carried them up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrew them. Two of them, anyway. I didn\u2019t have time to toss the last one before you arrived.\u201d Again, he smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re very fast for a mortal.\u201d</p><p>As she stared up at him, he tried again to read her thoughts and couldn\u2019t. Was she a gifted one like her brother? If so, what was her gift? Neither had referenced it the night he had followed them home. And he hadn\u2019t seen her demonstrate one. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy did you kill them?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre you guys engaged in some kind of turf war or something? Are they encroaching upon your territory?\u201d Such derision and scorn. It didn\u2019t belong in that melodic voice.</p><p>\u201cI have no territory\u2014not here in the States, at least\u2014unless you count the small parcel of land upon which my current abode resides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sleep in a crypt or something?\u201d</p> <p>He laughed. \u201cNo. I like my creature comforts. And, no, I am not engaged in a turf war as you called it. I killed the vampires to protect you.\u201d</p><p>Anger flared in her gaze. \u201cFirst of all, I don\u2019t need protecting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe events that transpired the night we met suggest otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a unique situation. Vampires don\u2019t usually travel in packs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA comment that makes me wonder just how long you\u2019ve been hunting them.\u201d The fact that she still lived led him to believe this was a fairly new endeavor for her.</p> <p>\u201cYears,\u201d she responded defiantly.</p><p>He may not be able to read her thoughts clearly, but he could glean enough to know she told the truth. Even so, doubt plagued him. \u201cHow many years? You can\u2019t have seen more than twenty-five in your lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-seven, not that it\u2019s any of your business. And I\u2019ve hunted vampires for six of those.\u201d</p><p>Astonishment gripped him. This fragile, mortal woman had hunted and fought vampires for six years and survived to tell the tale? With no help from the network?</p><p>So much had been happening in North Carolina in recent years: The uprisings. The battles. And she had hunted vampires through it all?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cApparently not or I wouldn\u2019t be standing here.\u201d She frowned. \u201cWait. You said them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said them, that I had been hunting them, not us.\u201d</p><p>He swore silently.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have fangs. My eyes glow. I heal at an accelerated rate. And I have preternatural speed and strength. What do you think I am?\u201d he retorted. Until he was sure she and her brother were operating independently and weren\u2019t part of some new threat\u2014especially not members of the mercenary group he and the others had recently defeated\u2014he was reluctant to tell her that he was an immortal.</p><p>He had actually once been like her brother: a gifted one, or mortal born with special abilities stemming from advanced DNA, before he had been infected with the vampiric virus. Vampires were human before they were infected and, lacking the advanced DNA, were driven insane by the brain damage it caused.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re different. You\u2019re not like the others.\u201d</p> <p>He arched a brow. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t try to kill you?\u201d</p><p>Her head continued to wag back and forth as her gaze skipped over him. \u201cYou\u2019re different.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. She didn\u2019t seem to be checking him out. She seemed to be studying him.</p><p>Did she see something that set him apart from the others?</p><p>\u201cHow am I different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>Not bloody likely.</p><p>She mimicked his frown and took another step back. \u201cWhy have you been following me?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d caught that, had she?</p><p>Well, curiosity had driven him to watch her. And she did prove to be a very good vampire lure. He hadn\u2019t killed this many vamps on a daily basis in quite some time.</p><p>He should have turned her name and address over to Chris Reordon. But there was something about her. He couldn\u2019t get her out of his head.</p><p>Not that he would admit it.</p><p>\u201cYou make good bait,\u201d he stated just to rile her.</p><p>Her face flushed with fury. \u201cI what?\u201d</p><p>Damn, she was beautiful. \u201cYou make good bait. Hunting vampires has never been so easy. I just follow you and take out the dullards who can\u2019t resist you and slink after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou . . . I . . . Is that an insult? Are you saying only dullards would be attracted to me?\u201d she sputtered.</p><p>If that\u2019s true, you\u2019re standing before a big-ass dullard, he wanted to say. \u201cOf course not. Only dullards would want to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, you can\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t just follow me and take out any vampires who fall for my trap.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou can\u2019t really stop me, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you could if you ceased hunting and left the slaying of vampires to me,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cSeriously, what are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? I\u2019m human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The tip of one of her swords nicked him as she pressed it to his throat. \u201cWhat do you know about my brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he\u2019s a healer, a gifted one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what a gifted one is, but you leave him the hell out of this,\u201d she snarled.</p><p>\u201cAs long as he aids you in your quest, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding.\u201d Her expression fierce, she pressed forward. \u201cStay. The hell. Away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you fear for his safety, you have only yourself to blame. You led me to him.\u201d</p><p>Alarm and self-condemnation flitted across her pretty face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before you lead vampires to him as well,\u201d he pointed out, \u201cif you haven\u2019t already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t. I\u2019ve been careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Did you know I followed you?\u201d</p><p>Fear suffused Krysta.</p><p>Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.</p><p>She\u2019d been so stupid! She\u2019d been so confident! She\u2019d been so sure that she had gotten away clean after each hunt.</p><p>And she had led this vampire straight to Sean?</p><p>Worse than that, she wouldn\u2019t have even known it if he hadn\u2019t told her.</p><p>Her hand began to tremble.</p><p>How many times had Sean begged her to stop? Told her it was too risky? Admitted he feared losing her? And now she could lose him because of her own hubris and carelessness.</p><p>She lowered her sword. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt him. If you\u2019re going to kill one of us, kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not kill the both of you?\u201d he posed.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m the one with the quest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what quest might that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo kill every bloodsucking vampire in existence.\u201d</p><p>He pursed his lips. \u201cThat\u2019s quite a quest. I\u2019ve been killing vampires for two hundred years and have barely made a dent.\u201d</p><p>Shock struck her speechless.</p><p>Two hundred years? She didn\u2019t know what stunned her more. That Etienne was that old\u2014he didn\u2019t look a day over thirty!\u2014or that there were really that many vampires on the planet.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had hoped . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat vampires were a regional thing?\u201d he finished for her.</p><p>She nodded dumbly. How had he guessed so accurately?</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t,\u201d he said, and there was kindness in his voice. Sympathy. From a vampire.</p><p>One who had, if she could believe him, spent the past two centuries\u2014two centuries\u2014killing other vampires.</p><p>Abruptly, the song \u201cSquirrels in My Pants\u201d from Phineas and Ferb filled the air.</p><p>Etienne fumbled in his pocket and withdrew a cell phone.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t even noticed until then that his weapons were all sheathed. Not once, in this entire conversation, had he threatened her.</p><p>He glanced at the caller ID. \u201cOne moment, please.\u201d Turning away slightly, he answered. \u201cOui?\u201d He glanced at her from the corner of his eye. \u201cMaintenant? . . . Je suis dans le milieu de quelque chose . . .\u201d He groaned. \u201cBien. Bien. Deux minutes.\u201d</p><p>He pocketed the phone.</p><p>\u201cSquirrels in My Pants?\u201d she couldn\u2019t resist asking.</p><p>His handsome face lit with a faint smile. \u201cInside joke. I\u2019m afraid I must leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlaces to go, vampires to party with?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and backed away. \u201cGo home, Krysta.\u201d</p><p>How the hell did he know her name?</p><p>And why did hearing him say it induce shivers of pleasure?</p><p>\u201cNo more hunting,\u201d he ordered. Or implored.</p><p>She just couldn\u2019t read this guy. She was attracted to him, damn it, and it was warping her judgement. So she said nothing.</p><p>\u201cPromise me,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d she said. \u201cNo more hunting.\u201d</p><p>His handsome face relaxed into an easy grin.</p><p>\u201cTonight,\u201d she added. \u201cNo more hunting tonight.\u201d She needed to take a step back and try to absorb everything she had learned.</p><p>His scowl returned. \u201cStubborn wench. Until we meet again then.\u201d He bowed. \u201cBonne nuit.\u201d</p><p>His form blurred and dashed around the corner, moving so swiftly ordinary humans wouldn\u2019t be able to follow him with their eyes. He could run past some and all they would feel or notice was the breeze his passing created.</p><p>But Krysta could follow his aura. It lit up the night.</p><p>Hurrying to the corner, she peered around the building\u2019s edge.</p><p>Etienne was a distant, dark figure surrounded by phosphorescent, constantly shifting white and purple near the frat house.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a second dark figure with an identical aura joined him.</p><p>She gasped. The other\u2019s aura hadn\u2019t approached from any direction. It\u2014he\u2014had just appeared out of thin air.</p><p>The stranger touched Etienne\u2019s shoulder. Both vanished.</p><p>Her knees weakening, Krysta leaned against the rough bricks of the building beside her.</p><p>There were two of them. Two vampires with that fascinating aura she had never before beheld.</p><p>And one of them could teleport.</p><p>Or could both of them? She hadn\u2019t heard or seen Etienne\u2019s approach tonight. One second she had been demanding he show himself. The next he had spoken behind her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After talking with him, she had assumed he had just jumped down from the roof. Had he instead teleported?</p><p>Was that even what it was called? Teleporting? It sounded so sci-fi. Not vampirish at all.</p><p>Sighing, she took out her cell phone and called Sean.</p><p>A moment later, their battered Dodge Shadow halted before her and the passenger door sprang open.</p> <p>Her brother\u2019s curious gaze pierced her as she sank into the bucket seat and slammed the door.</p><p>\u201cNo luck tonight?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Kinda hard to miss the lack of blood splatter.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>He sent her an encouraging smile. \u201cMaybe you killed them all.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cI wish.\u201d</p><p>He began the journey home. \u201cYou must have scared them off. You haven\u2019t gone this long without fighting one in a few years.\u201d</p><p>She made some noncommittal sound as guilt consumed her. She should tell him about Etienne. She actually opened her mouth to do so three or four times as the engine stuttered and struggled to get them home. But what could she say? I\u2019m being stalked by that gorgeous vampire you saw me with two weeks ago. No, he doesn\u2019t fight me. He claims he\u2019s protecting me. Yes, the vampire. Yes, by all appearances, he is protecting me. He keeps killing all of the vampires I hunt. No, I don\u2019t know what his game is. And, yes, I\u2019m attracted to him. That\u2019s right\u2014attracted. As in I would love to see him naked. It\u2019s sick. I get it. He\u2019s a bloodsucking vampire. But I can\u2019t help it. My freaking heart pounds every time he comes near me and it isn\u2019t from fear that he\u2019ll kill me.</p><p>She gazed into the blackness beyond the passenger window.</p><p>There was just something about him. Something mesmerizing.</p><p>Her reflection\u2019s brow furrowed.</p> <p>Was she losing it? Was the strain of six years of battling vampire after insane vampire beginning to get to her? Or . . .</p><p>A chill skittered through her.</p><p>Was the vampires\u2019 madness rubbing off on her? Was it contagious?</p><p>She had been bitten that one time seven years ago. She had assumed, because she hadn\u2019t turned into a vampire overnight, that there had been no long-term damage. What if she were wrong? What if the madness that crippled vampires had slowly but surely been finding and securing a home in her?</p><p>Fear cut through her veins like diamonds.</p><p>Could it be true? Could that be it?</p><p>Even if one bite couldn\u2019t do it, she had been exposed to their blood countless times over the years in battle. How many times did it take?</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d her brother asked.</p> <p>\u201cJust tired,\u201d she lied.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d He took his eyes off the road momentarily to study her. \u201cAre you worried about the vampire who helped you?\u201d</p><p>She sent him a sharp glance. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s just weird that he helped you. You\u2019ve never encountered a vampire who didn\u2019t try to kill or turn you. I\u2019ve been worried that he might . . . I don\u2019t know . . . come back and finish what he didn\u2019t have a chance to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he had wanted to kill me, he had ample opportunity to do so.\u201d</p><p>A scowl creased his brow. \u201cHow can you be so sure? Maybe he\u2019s screwing with you? He didn\u2019t get into your head, did he?\u201d</p><p>Relief and anger overwhelmed her as she realized her brother might have just hit the proverbial nail on the head.</p><p>A slew of silent epithets drowned out whatever Sean said next.</p><p>That\u2019s it! It has to be! Etienne has literally gotten into my head. I mean, if he can freaking teleport, a little mind control really isn\u2019t that hard to believe.</p><p>Other vampires could do it. The reason no one knew vampires existed was because victims of vampire attacks who lived could never recall having been bitten or give any description of their attacker. They even laughed outright at the notion that Krysta had saved them from a vampire who had been eagerly draining their blood.</p><p>Not one vampire victim with whom she had spoken had retained any memory of being attacked. If that wasn\u2019t mind control, what was?</p><p>Anger simmered within her. \u201cI am so going to kick his ass,\u201d she growled.</p><p>Sean\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cThe purple and white vamp?\u201d</p><p>She had told him about Etienne\u2019s aura. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think you\u2019ll see him again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll see him again. He left me alive for a reason. And I\u2019m going to kick his ass until he tells me what it is.\u201d</p><p>His frown returned. \u201cJust don\u2019t go looking for him, Krys. Seriously. I have a bad feeling about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she was able to say with complete honesty.</p><p>If he stayed true to his recent pattern, Etienne would come looking for her. And when he did . . .</p><p>She smiled grimly.</p><p>He was going to regret messing with her head.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Etienne glanced at his twin as they arrived in David\u2019s large living room. \u201cAre you the smart-ass who changed my ringtone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone changed your ringtone?\u201d Richart asked. \u201cTo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>Darnell approached, a tiny kitten in each hand. \u201cOkay, which one do you want?\u201d</p><p>Etienne reached for the little gray and white one. \u201cWe\u2019re really doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>A faint, high-pitched scream came from Etienne\u2019s pocket, accompanied by a drumbeat. \u201cThere are squirrels in my pants!\u201d a girl cried as Phineas and Ferb\u2019s \u201cSquirrels in My Pants\u201d song began blaring from his phone.</p><p>Every immortal in the room turned to look at him.</p><p>Etienne scowled at his brother.</p><p>Laughing, Richart closed his cell phone and put it away. \u201cI didn\u2019t change it. I just wanted to know what it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsshole.\u201d He took the ridiculously small bottle of milk Darnell handed him. \u201cAs I was saying, we\u2019re really doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery two hours.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. He could still be chatting up Krysta if he didn\u2019t have to play feline nursemaid.</p><p>\u201cHow much has David done for you over the centuries?\u201d Darnell retorted, his shaved, brown head gleaming in the overhead light.</p><p>\u201cA hell of a lot,\u201d Etienne answered without hesitation. David was like Seth. He gave everything he had to the Immortal Guardians and those who aided them.</p><p>\u201cAnd what has he asked in return?\u201d Darnell continued.</p><p>\u201cNot a damned thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. So feed the kitten.\u201d</p><p>Etienne cuddled the mewling little bundle of fur to his chest. \u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>Richart took the orange and white kitten and did the same.</p><p>\u201cEvery two hours, guys,\u201d Darnell reminded them again as they crossed the room and sank down beside Lisette on one of the sofas.</p><p>Roland and Sarah fed two kittens on another sofa.</p><p>Roland was quite possibly the most aggravating, antisocial immortal on the planet. Seeing him cuddle and nurture a black and white kitten that could fit in the palm of his hand was nothing short of bizarre.</p><p>Grunts and thumps floated up from downstairs, where Seconds sparred in the training room.</p><p>Ami entered, carrying Slim. That scrawny little feline didn\u2019t look fully grown either, though it had long since reached adulthood. It also bore several bare patches, scars, and cuts from its most recent fights with whatever woodland creature it had felt ventured too close to Slim\u2019s new territory: David\u2019s property.</p><p>\u201cHi, Ami,\u201d Sarah called with a smile.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>The men all echoed the greeting.</p><p>Every male Immortal Guardian in North Carolina adored the two women. They loved Sarah for being the first gifted one in history to ask to be infected so she could spend eternity with Roland\u2019s antisocial ass. They loved Ami for . . . well . . . being Ami.</p><p>She was so sweet and shy. And fucking ferocious on the battlefield. A mere week after being named Marcus\u2019s Second, she had helped him stand against and defeat thirty-four vampires. Thirty-four. No mortal had ever attempted such a feat. Hell, no immortal had either until then. Except, perhaps, for Seth or David. Those two had lived thousands of years. Etienne didn\u2019t know half of what they had done.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Marcus?\u201d Sarah asked.</p><p>\u201cOut hunting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he get out of kitten duty?\u201d Roland asked dourly, even though everyone here could clearly see he had a soft spot for animals.</p><p>Ami stroked Slim\u2019s fur. \u201cSlim doesn\u2019t like smelling other cats on him.\u201d</p><p>Etienne suspected there was more to it than that, but didn\u2019t say anything. Marcus had been giving off all kinds of stress vibes lately.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, I\u2019m going to take Slim out for a jaunt until you\u2019re finished in here. I think he needs a break.\u201d</p><p>Slim chose that moment to emit a peculiar howl.</p><p>Chuckles circled the room as she passed through the kitchen, then exited through the back door.</p><p>Stepping out into the brisk wind, Ami set Slim down on the back deck and gave his skinny little butt a pat. \u201cAll right, you crazy kitty. Have fun.\u201d</p><p>Perking up, he meowed and trotted down the steps into the darkened yard.</p><p>Ami stood still for a moment, enjoying the night.</p><p>Quiet engulfed her. Since she didn\u2019t have the superior hearing of immortals, the conversations of those within couldn\u2019t reach her out here. Only the rustling of leaves that fluttered in the breeze broke the silence.</p><p>Retrieving the lightweight aluminum ladder kept on the deck, she descended the porch steps and walked around to the side of the house. The ladder was just tall enough to reach the roof. Ami leaned it up against the gutters and gave it a shake to ensure it was steady before she placed her foot on the first rung and began to climb.</p><p>At the top, she peered over the edge of the roof, already knowing whom she would find seated upon it.</p><p>As usual, he wore black leather pants and nothing else. A pair of beautiful wings, as tan as his skin at their base and darkening to black at their tips, were folded against his back. His shoulder-length, wavy, black hair danced in the wind.</p><p>Hi, she greeted him mentally. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shook his head. How do you always know I\u2019m here? Rising, he strode silently across the roof, took her hand, and helped her the rest of the way up.</p><p>I know your energy signature now.</p><p>His brow furrowed. I\u2019m glad Seth can\u2019t detect me so easily. I doubt he\u2019d respond well to learning I\u2019ve been . . . visiting.</p> <p>She thought he might be right on that one. Her husband Marcus wouldn\u2019t either, if he knew.</p><p>Seating herself, Ami waited for Zach to reclaim his spot, then withdrew two lollipops from her jacket.</p><p>His lips tilted up in a faint smile. Which one do I want tonight?</p><p>She offered him a green one. Apple.</p><p>The smell of fresh fruit\u2014Granny Smith apples and ripe strawberries\u2014filled the air as they unwrapped their treats and let the flavors coat their tongues.</p> <p>This was the sixth or seventh time she had met him up here. She alone seemed capable of detecting his presence.</p><p>She still didn\u2019t know who he was, but sensed he posed no threat to her.</p><p>He rarely spoke. That didn\u2019t bother her though. She hadn\u2019t been much of a talker either after Seth and David had rescued her from her torturers. And the first time she had met Zach he had been riddled with wounds and trembling with pain.</p><p>Ami understood pain.</p><p>She also understood a reluctance to trust.</p><p>Wind buffeted her, rocking her on her perch.</p> <p>Zach unfurled his wings to shield her from the breeze.</p><p>So, he drawled, surprising her, how are you?</p><p>She turned her head and found him studying her intently. You know? she asked.</p><p>About your pregnancy? Yes.</p><p>Only a handful of people had been told, so either he had overheard it or he had detected the baby\u2019s heartbeat and, unlike the others, knew it didn\u2019t belong to one of the kittens.</p><p>Dr. Lipton said the baby has a strong, healthy heartbeat.</p><p>I didn\u2019t ask about the baby. I asked about you. How are you doing?</p><p>Shrugging, she lowered her gaze to the lollipop wrapper and began to fold and unfold it. The nausea is pretty bad. Lollipops are the only sweet things I can stand to smell or eat. Anything else makes me throw up. As did most foods. Marcus was worried that she wasn\u2019t getting enough nutrition, because almost everything she put in her stomach came right back up again.</p> <p>Are you afraid? he asked softly.</p><p>Ami\u2019s throat thickened. Her vision grew hazy as tears welled in her eyes. Raising her head, she met his gentle gaze. Terrified.</p><p>Zach\u2019s chest constricted when tears spilled over her lashes and trailed down her cheeks. Ami was the kindest, gentlest mortal he had encountered in his long existence. Ironically, she was also one of the fiercest, most determined fighters. To see her so vulnerable made his heart hurt.</p><p>And Zach hadn\u2019t even realized he had a heart.</p><p>I wish I could see the future, he said, so I could tell you how this will turn out.</p><p>She smiled and brushed at her cheeks. At least you didn\u2019t tell me everything will be all right.</p><p>Is that what your husband does? he asked curiously.</p><p>She shook her head. Marcus never lies to me. A sad smile tilted her lips. So he says very little. He asks how I feel and does everything he can to make me happy, help me feel better, keep me from stressing over what might happen, all the things that could go wrong. More tears welled. And tries to carry all of the burden himself.</p><p>Zach swallowed. There really wasn\u2019t anything he could say to ease her mind and steal away her despair. It surprised him that he even wished to try.</p><p>Did you know, she asked, sniffling, that before I came here I had never seen a pregnant woman?</p><p>No. He couldn\u2019t imagine it, and sometimes forgot that she was from another planet.</p><p>She smiled. The first one I saw had a belly so huge I thought something was seriously wrong with her.</p><p>She must have wondered what the hell was in that belly. How is that possible? he asked. Don\u2019t people on your planet reproduce the same way we do?</p><p>She nodded. Visitors came to us from another solar system under the guise of friendship and used a virus as a bioweapon against us. No one died from it, so we thought it was an accident, that they hadn\u2019t known they were carriers, and didn\u2019t think much of it until we realized that almost every woman on our planet had been rendered infertile by it. Those who weren\u2019t usually miscarried. Successful pregnancies that go to term are practically nonexistent now. And female children are just as likely to be infertile. It\u2019s one of the reasons I came here. I hoped to find some Earth women who might like to either serve as surrogate mothers or marry our men and help us repopulate.</p><p>And the other?</p><p>She shook her head. To warn you that the beings who tried to eradicate us are on their way to eradicate you.</p><p>Lovely. And for that you were ruthlessly tortured for six months.</p><p>Yes. She was quiet for a long moment. I never thought I would be a mother. Another minute passed. Marcus never thought he would be a father.</p><p>The odds of either were . . .</p><p>Well, hell, he would have thought it impossible even without knowing her people\u2019s history.</p><p>Congratulations.</p><p>She stared at him. Moisture once more welled in her eyes.</p><p>Again Zach\u2019s chest tightened. He cupped his knees in his palms, slid his hands over the soft leather anxiously. Should I not have\u2014?</p><p>She shook her head, lips curling into a trembling smile, and brushed the tears from her cheeks. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just . . . you\u2019re the first person who has congratulated me. Everyone else . . .</p><p>Is concerned.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He looked at her stomach, hidden beneath one of Marcus\u2019s large sweatshirts. May I?</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Zach leaned close. Placing a hand on her stomach, which was rounder than he had expected beneath the soft material, he concentrated on the life it sheltered. The babe seems healthy. Maybe a little large.</p><p>She smiled, her face lighting a bit. That\u2019s what Seth said. Marcus is large, too, though, so that\u2019s the one thing that doesn\u2019t concern me.</p><p>He hoped that was the explanation. A mixture of gifted one and alien DNA with the vampiric virus thrown in . . .</p><p>No one knew what the hell to expect.</p><p>And all feared the worst. Those who knew, anyway.</p><p>You know what I think you should do? he said, drawing back.</p><p>What?</p><p>Enjoy the moment. Live like there is no tomorrow. You have a healthy babe in your belly and a husband who loves you. Let the others worry about the what-ifs. Stressing over what might happen isn\u2019t good for the baby.</p><p>She nodded. I\u2019ll try.</p><p>The front door opened and closed below them.</p><p>\u201cBon soir!\u201d Lisette called, stepping into view as she donned a motorcycle helmet.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d Sarah responded cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cGood hunting,\u201d Roland added.</p><p>A moment later, the French immortal sped away on the back of her motorcycle.</p><p>\u201cWant to run home?\u201d Roland asked as he and his wife strolled into view.</p><p>\u201cDo you mean literally run?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and wrapped his arms around her, drawing her body against his. \u201cI know how exhilarating you find it. And I love anything that lights your beautiful eyes with excitement.\u201d He kissed her.</p><p>Her eyes began to glow as she sank into him. \u201cWe\u2019ll be all sweaty when we get home.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get sweaty once we\u2019re home anyway.\u201d</p><p>She emitted a throaty laugh. \u201cShall we make it interesting then and race?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about we race naked? If I catch you, we make love wherever I tackle you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd risk having vampires catch us in flagrante delicto? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cPerhaps another night then.\u201d</p><p>She stepped back. \u201cOn three?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. One. Two.\u201d She took off, her slender form blurring as she sped off into the night. \u201cThree!\u201d she called from half a mile away, laughter trailing after her.</p><p>Roland\u2019s usually dour face broke into a wide grin as he took off after her.</p><p>Zack looked at Ami and found her smiling.</p><p>What\u2019s it like? he asked, curious.</p><p>What?</p><p>He started to say love. Affection. Friendship. Nothing. Never mind.</p><p>She grimaced. Ech. My stomach is starting to churn again. I\u2019d better go. I doubt David would appreciate it if I vomited all over his solar panels.</p><p>Zach thought David wouldn\u2019t care if Ami puked all over his dreadlocks. The elder immortal just wanted her to be happy and healthy and safe.</p><p>Rising, he walked with her over to the ladder and steadied her as she found the rungs with her feet. She didn\u2019t need his aid. She was as sure-footed as a cat. Her condition just made him feel protective.</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>Would you like to come with me? she asked.</p><p>No, thank you.</p><p>She smiled and descended the ladder.</p><p>Zach retook his position in the center of the roof. Tucking his wings in close, he listened as she returned the ladder to its hangers and went inside.</p><p>Quiet enfolded him, broken only by the occasional conversation filtering up from the house.</p><p>What the hell are you doing, Zach? he asked himself. Why was he so drawn to this place? To these people? What had changed?</p><p>Was Seth right? Had he changed?</p><p>He heard Darnell greet Ami inside as he collected kittens from immortals and returned them to whatever basket or box they kept them in. \u201cI\u2019m heading downstairs to challenge the Seconds that are training tonight. How much you wanna bet I beat them?\u201d</p><p>Had Ami been the one to make the challenge, Zach knew every dollar would be placed on her. But she hadn\u2019t sparred with the others since she\u2019d learned she was pregnant.</p><p>\u201cAll at once?\u201d Richart asked before Ami could respond.</p><p>\u201cNah. One or two at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet a thousand on you,\u201d the Frenchman declared.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Etienne said. \u201cThere are too many. They\u2019ll tire him out. A thousand on the other Seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get in on this?\u201d another asked.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going to get a thousand dollars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They all moved down to the basement, where loud cheering and taunting erupted as the first match began.</p><p>They really did seem like one big family. How had Seth accomplished that?</p><p>Something stung Zach\u2019s neck. Reaching up, he felt around and found three darts sticking out of it.</p> <p>Yanking them out, he stared down at them. These weren\u2019t mercenary darts. They were the darts Dr. Lipton had fashioned for the immortals to use against vampires.</p><p>He scanned the dark scenery around him, looking for the culprit, and belatedly heard the heartbeat behind him that his thoughts had drowned out.</p><p>Casually, he turned. His own heart gave a weird little skip. Lisette, the French immortal, crouched there, her lovely face expressionless.</p><p>And her face truly was lovely. He had never been this close to her before. Her skin was pale perfection, her raven hair pulled back from her face in a braid that fell to her waist. Her slender body was clad in a formfitting T-shirt and cargo pants accentuated with holstered Glock 18s. The handles of two sheathed shoto swords peeked at him over her shoulders.</p><p>She reminded him of that woman in the Tomb Raider games he had seen Darnell and Ami playing.</p> <p>And her scent . . .</p><p>He drew in a deep breath. She smelled even better than Ami. And Ami smelled better than the lollipops she brought him.</p><p>A long minute passed during which Lisette stared at him, waiting for the tranquilizer to take effect. Little did she know the drug would have no more effect on him than it would on Seth.</p><p>Zach raised an eyebrow.</p><p>Her forehead crinkled in a frown. Quick as lightning, she drew three more darts from her pocket and stuck them in his neck.</p><p>With slow, deliberate movements, Zach reached up and removed them.</p> <p>She bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cThat hurts, you know,\u201d he said softly enough that he hoped those down in the house wouldn\u2019t hear it over the sparring noises and boisterous cheers.</p><p>A thin wire slipped over his head from behind and jerked across his neck, shutting off air.</p><p>\u201cNot as much as this will, asshole,\u201d a male voice growled in his ear.</p><p>It carried a British accent, so it wasn\u2019t one of her brothers.</p><p>What exactly was going on here?</p><p>Before Zach could ponder further, a figure appeared on the roof beside him. Sarah met Zach\u2019s gaze, took in the piano wire choking him, glanced at Lisette\u2014who looked guilty as hell\u2014then turned her attention to the man behind Zach.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Sarah said.</p> <p>\u201cYou followed me?\u201d that one growled.</p><p>Ah. Roland.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCuriosity. You wouldn\u2019t say why you were coming back and told me not to follow you, which left me no choice but to do so.\u201d</p><p>Both spoke as softly as Zach had.</p><p>Roland grunted.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Roland parroted.</p><p>\u201cWatcha doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLisette has some questions for this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. And . . . you thought this was the best way to elicit answers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Uh-huh. You don\u2019t think . . . maybe . . . this sort of thing might be why everyone calls you antisocial?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering the questions, I thought he would likely be uncooperative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She studied Zach, then looked at Lisette. \u201cOhhhhhh.\u201d Her brows drew together. \u201cIs this a lover\u2019s quarrel kind of thing? Did he do something to piss you off?\u201d</p><p>Lisette looked uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t cheat on you, did he?\u201d Sarah asked, all concern. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were seeing anyone.\u201d</p><p>Zach watched Lisette, ignoring the pain in his throat and the burn beginning to fill his lungs.</p><p>Lisette visually consulted Roland over Zach\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt isn\u2019t about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who is it about?\u201d Sarah asked.</p><p>Roland must have mouthed a name, because\u2014though Zach heard nothing\u2014Sarah\u2019s eyes blazed a bright luminescent green, very rare amongst immortals. \u201cReally.\u201d She moved, silently circling around to stand with her husband at Zach\u2019s back. \u201cLet me give you a little help with that, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>In all of his thousands of years of existence, Zach didn\u2019t think anything so peculiar had ever happened to him.</p><p>Or so intriguing.</p><p>Or entertaining.</p><p>As the husband-and-wife team slowly choked him toward unconsciousness, he pondered what to do. He could make enough noise to draw David\u2019s attention. But David wouldn\u2019t appreciate his presence here any more than Seth would.</p><p>He could teleport away. But anyone touching him would go with him. So he would only escape Lisette, and she was the most interesting person here. She was the reason he hadn\u2019t yet attempted to secure his freedom.</p><p>Roland planted a boot in Zach\u2019s back and pulled harder.</p><p>Roland had said Lisette wanted to talk to him. That she had some questions for Zach.</p><p>What kind of questions?</p><p>How did she even know about him?</p><p>How had she detected his presence when Seth and David hadn\u2019t?</p><p>His heartbeat sounded loudly in his ears as his lungs hungered for oxygen.</p><p>Zach couldn\u2019t seem to find the will to fight them. He wanted to know what Lisette wanted from him. Had Roland and Sarah stopped trying to suffocate him and stepped back, he didn\u2019t think he would have left.</p><p>Hmm. He could just go with it.</p><p>The idea appealed to him far more than it should. He wasn\u2019t supposed to care about this. Any of it. Or these people.</p><p>But his damned curiosity wouldn\u2019t leave him be.</p><p>And Seth hadn\u2019t been far from the truth when they had spoken in South Korea. The numbness was wearing off. Boredom had set in. Zach was drowning in it. And he would do just about anything, including allow the odd couple behind him to force him into unconsciousness, to swim his way back to the surface and leave it behind him.</p><p>A very dangerous mind-set that had already gotten him into trouble once.</p><p>His eyes locked on Lisette\u2019s face.</p><p>Fuck it. He wanted to know.</p><p>The smile he gave her as darkness enfolded him must have puzzled the hell out of her.</p><p>Lisette stared down at the unconscious male Roland dumped onto the floor of the safe house they had claimed for the day.</p><p>He was incredibly handsome. Dark, wavy hair fell below his shoulders. A muscled chest devoid of hair tapered to a narrow waist and slim hips encased in black leather.</p><p>Her gaze went to his wings.</p><p>They were beautiful. The same tan as his skin at their base, the nearly translucent wings darkened to black at their tips and would span twelve or fourteen feet when fully extended.</p><p>The man himself was taller than Seth, who stood a good six foot eight or thereabouts.</p><p>\u201cDo you know him?\u201d she asked Roland as he left the room.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He returned, carrying titanium chains thicker than her biceps that humans would probably have to use a forklift to move. Dumping the lot on the floor, he crouched next to their prisoner.</p><p>\u201cIs he an immortal?\u201d Sarah asked as she took a position beside her husband, weapons drawn.</p><p>\u201cHe must be,\u201d Roland mumbled, taking the man by the throat and dragging him upright. \u201cVampires don\u2019t have wings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Lisette halted him before he could start wrapping the man in chains. Hurrying to the only bedroom in the small house, she yanked the covers off the bed and took them into the living room.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d Roland asked with a scowl.</p><p>She knelt beside him. \u201cIf he\u2019s immortal, Seth won\u2019t respond well to him being damaged.\u201d Dropping the bedding, she leaned forward and tentatively touched one of his wings.</p><p>So soft. Like the delicate strands of hair on a newborn baby\u2019s head.</p><p>Her heart began to pound as she gently took both wings and folded them in close to his back. Holding them in place with one hand, she wrapped the sheet and blanket around him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Roland asked with a scowl. \u201cYour heart is beating faster.\u201d</p><p>That part of being an Immortal Guardian sucked. There really were very few secrets among their ranks because of their damned heightened senses. \u201cAre you sure he\u2019s an immortal? I can\u2019t smell the virus on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you smell it on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about David and Seth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s your answer. He\u2019s an immortal. He just must be old as hell.\u201d Once she finished and sat back, he started wrapping the chains around and around the stranger.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s that old,\u201d Sarah murmured, \u201cwouldn\u2019t you know him, honey?\u201d</p><p>Lisette snorted. \u201cAs antisocial as Roland is, he wouldn\u2019t even know me if I hadn\u2019t made myself a nuisance.\u201d</p><p>The dour immortal\u2019s face actually lightened with a smile. \u201cYou weren\u2019t the nuisance. Your brothers were.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. He may be curt and surly with the others, but he had always been kind to her.</p><p>Soon the winged mystery immortal was swathed tightly in chains from his neck to his feet. Why did seeing him like that bother her so? She didn\u2019t know him. Had never met him. And had good reason to dislike him.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d she asked as the three of them stood in a semicircle and stared down at him.</p><p>\u201cWe wait until he wakes up, then extract information.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the window. \u201cDawn is approaching.\u201d</p><p>Roland followed her gaze. \u201cGo home. We\u2019ll take first watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be here when you question him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he wakes before sunset, we\u2019ll await your return.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, strangely reluctant to leave. Giving their prisoner one last look, she said her good-byes, then headed out into the night.</p><p>Etienne paced outside Krysta\u2019s home, listening to her shoot the breeze with her brother while they prepared for the night\u2019s hunt.</p><p>This was ridiculous. He had awoken this afternoon, full of anticipation, eager to see Krysta again, and hadn\u2019t wasted a second getting here once the sun had set. Even Cameron, his Second, had noticed something was amiss. He hadn\u2019t said anything, but Etienne had caught the What\u2019s up with you? looks Cam had shot him while doling out weapons. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A slender shadow crossed the curtains. Etienne glimpsed Krysta in the living room. She was arming herself with more weapons than he had realized she carried. Damned near as many as he carried.</p><p>Why did that turn him on?</p><p>He sighed.</p> <p>Was this what he had come to? Stalking her like one of those freaks on the Internet you heard about on the news?</p><p>Yes, he imagined Cam telling him.</p><p>Had he really sunk so low?</p><p>He had even been tempted to circle around to the other side of the house, peer through her bedroom window, and watch her dress, but that had just seemed too sleazy. Besides, if he ever saw Krysta naked, he wanted it to be on her terms with\u2014</p><p>Wait. What the hell was he thinking? He wasn\u2019t going to see Krysta naked. He couldn\u2019t see Krysta naked. She bore what was obviously a deep-seated hatred for vampires, from which she didn\u2019t differentiate him, and would destroy him in an instant if given the opportunity.</p> <p>Even if he managed to lessen her desire to decapitate him, there was still the whole mortal-immortal thing. He wasn\u2019t sure she was a gifted one. If her brother was her half brother, she may not possess the advanced DNA needed to transform without becoming vampire. Not that she would want to anyway because of the whole I hate vampires roadblock.</p><p>Etienne straightened.</p><p>Was he really trying to think his way into a relationship with a woman who wanted him dead? Was he that lonely?</p><p>Or was she just that irresistible?</p><p>Don\u2019t answer that, he warned himself and blamed all of the happy pappy lovestruck crap that had surrounded him of late for his current confusion. First Roland had fallen in love with Sarah, who clearly was delusional for thinking him sweet.</p><p>Then Marcus had found Ami. The jury was still out on whether or not their relationship was going to have a happy ending because Ami had not yet asked Marcus to transform her.</p> <p>Richart had fallen hard for Jenna, who\u2014Etienne was very pleased to note\u2014made his brother very happy.</p><p>Even that bastard Bastien had fallen in love with and married Dr. Lipton.</p><p>The jangling of keys shook Etienne from his musings. He ducked out of sight as the front door swung open.</p><p>Krysta exited first, her shoto swords clutched in one hand, her coat in the other.</p><p>Etienne silently cursed as his pulse picked up its pace.</p><p>Sean exited next, carrying a pile of heavy books, and tromped down the stairs.</p><p>Etienne had learned from his shameless eavesdropping sessions (there had been more of those than he cared to admit in the two weeks he had been following her) that Sean was in medical school and usually studied in the car while she hunted.</p><p>Krysta\u2019s eyes scanned the area as they crossed the yard to their crappy car.</p> <p>Both doors groaned when pried open. And the damned engine barely turned over.</p><p>Though Krysta worked days and Sean weekends, freeing up the nights for hunting, they barely made ends meet.</p><p>Etienne had been tempted to call in the network to make all the repairs the car needed, but that would bring the sibling vampire hunters to Chris Reordon\u2019s attention.</p><p>Not a good idea.</p><p>Etienne raced through the countryside, following the shabby vehicle and making sure forest, field, or structures always hid him from view.</p><p>Looked like they were heading for Duke tonight.</p><p>The hunt was on.</p><p>That\u2019s right, dullards, Krysta thought, mentally smiling as she used Etienne\u2019s term, come along, follow the poor, unsuspecting undergrad who doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re there because she\u2019s busy drunk dialing her ex.</p><p>That one was always popular. There were times, in fact, when she could actually hear some of the vampires laugh over the crazy-ass things she said or shouted into the phone while staggering up the path. Perhaps, in another life, she could have been an actress.</p><p>There had been no vamp action around the frat houses tonight. Rather she had found them lingering in Research Park, waiting for an egghead to stumble out after working on whatever it was he or she researched until the wee hours.</p><p>Along the sidewalk, Krysta led them between two buildings, and into a darker area near the loading dock. She thought there had been lights back here the last time she had passed by. The vamps must have broken them, intending to feed on their victim where none would see.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>Her heart began to pound, not with fear as she prepared to spin around and fight, but with anticipation. Etienne was nearby. She knew it. She could feel it. And she wasn\u2019t going to let him snatch away her prize this time. She was going to confront the vamps before he had the chance.</p><p>Drawing her shoto swords, she spun around at the same moment Etienne appeared behind the vamps.</p><p>Ooh. Six vampires. Good thing he had come.</p><p>Etienne\u2019s brows drew down in a frown as he met her gaze. \u201cDamn it! You\u2019re early!\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cNope. You\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>The vampires\u2019 faces went blank with surprise. Their gazes zigzagged between the two of them.</p><p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d one said, his face filling with fear as he stared at Etienne. \u201cAn Immortal Guardian.\u201d</p><p>Gasps from his vampire cohorts.</p><p>A what?</p><p>Another vampire looked at Krysta. \u201cShe\u2019s human. She must be his Second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastien has a mortal Second,\u201d another said.</p><p>Who had a what now?</p><p>Krysta was given no time to ask.</p><p>Their faces contorted with fury. \u201cBastien the Deceiver!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath to Bastien!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKick their fucking asses!\u201d</p><p>The vampires drew weapons and attacked.</p><p>Krysta inched backward and swung her swords as multiple orange auras shot toward her.</p><p>The vampires must think they would have an easier time killing her than they would Etienne.</p><p>Smart vamps.</p><p>Sucked for her, though.</p><p>Even as she struck lethal blows with her blades, slicing the throat of the first vampire to reach her, pain streaked through her thigh as another vamp\u2019s blade cut into her flesh.</p><p>Krysta gritted her teeth and swung at the orange aura leaping away from her.</p><p>Score! Tit for tat. She\u2019d cut his femoral artery, the bastard!</p><p>Limping backward, she kept her swords in constant motion. Glowing orange auras swirled around her, so numerous that fear threatened to paralyze her.</p><p>She struck more blows, aiming at auras and hitting the flesh they preceded.</p><p>The vampires struck blows as well. Cuts stung her arms, back, legs. Just as she was silently celebrating a particularly good blow, one of the vamps circled around behind her and hit her in the head, landing a simple punch with his fist, backed by preternatural strength, that felt like a freaking anvil.</p><p>The world around her lit up with sparkly things that had nothing to do with auras. All strength left her limbs as agony pounded her head.</p><p>Krysta staggered. Her thoughts scattered.</p><p>Somewhere a lion roared.</p><p>The glowing orange auras surrounding her fell away as shining purple and white rolled through them like a bowling ball felling pins.</p><p>Krysta\u2019s weapons clattered to the ground, her fingers unable to grasp anything but her aching head.</p><p>She sank to her knees.</p><p>\u201cKrysta!\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Etienne wasn\u2019t usually one to panic. Even as a mortal, when fighting, he had always kept his cool.</p><p>But seeing Krysta felled by a vampire\u2019s fist . . .</p><p>\u201cKrysta!\u201d he called again, after severing that fist and leaving the vampire to bleed out.</p><p>His swords swung like the blades of a propeller, cutting through the vampires as though they were no more than air.</p><p>Had it been more than a glancing blow, wouldn\u2019t she be down on the ground and either unconscious or dying from a fractured skull? Sarah had nearly died when Bastien had fractured her skull. Her ears had even bled.</p><p>Etienne tried to see if Krysta bled from her ears, but couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the damned vampires.</p><p>Finally, the last vamp succumbed to Etienne\u2019s swords.</p><p>Racing to Krysta\u2019s side, he knelt before her and dropped his weapons. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d He clasped her shoulder with one hand and gently raised her chin with the other.</p><p>Her lovely face was pinched with pain. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she gritted. \u201cMy head just hurts like a bitch. I think I might have a concussion. My vision is all fuzzy.\u201d</p><p>Her pupils were a little dilated, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d she murmured. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Shock, pleasure, and all kinds of things he refused to examine too closely flowed through him. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Hardly a scratch on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be nice. Help me up, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He helped her to her feet, wrapping an arm around her when she swayed.</p><p>\u201cThe bastards all came after me,\u201d she complained, leaning into him.</p><p>Did she realize the trust she was placing in him?</p><p>He cleared his throat, trying to ignore how good it felt to have her tucked up against his side. \u201cVampires are often cowards and seek the weaker target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just meant\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it. I just don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019m stronger than you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. What\u2019s an Immortal Guardian?\u201d</p><p>Etienne swore silently. He had hoped she hadn\u2019t caught that.</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d he stalled, not knowing how to answer.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. An Immortal Guardian.\u201d Stepping away, she clung to his arm until she was steady, then released him and met his gaze. \u201cThe vampires called you an Immortal Guardian.\u201d</p><p>His cursed mind went blank.</p><p>\u201cThey also called me a Second. What\u2019s a Second?\u201d</p><p>Still nothing. What had Roland told Sarah when faced with such questions?</p><p>\u201cWho is Bastien the Deceiver?\u201d</p><p>He swore aloud then. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to have a concussion? How are you remembering all of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stalling.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he was.</p><p>Etienne paced away several steps. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t or won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you secrets that are not solely my own to share,\u201d he tried to explain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo there are more like you.\u201d</p><p>Etienne stared at her, wanting to trust her.</p><p>A sharp pain pierced his neck.</p> <p>Wincing, he reached up, felt something protruding from the skin, and removed it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Krysta asked.</p><p>His blood went cold as he stared down at the tiny object his fingers clutched.</p><p>\u201cIs that a tranquilizer dart?\u201d she asked, voice full of confusion.</p><p>Yes, it was. Merde.</p> <p>\u201cRun,\u201d he ordered as weakness began to infiltrate him.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. This shouldn\u2019t be possible.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She started to approach him.</p><p>Etienne shook his head. \u201cRun!\u201d He closed the distance between them, retrieved her weapons from the ground, and urged her toward the corner of the nearest building. \u201cCall your brother. Choose a safe place for him to meet you a few blocks from here and run there. Don\u2019t stop. Don\u2019t look back. And don\u2019t let anyone follow you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. What\u2019s going on? Why is your accent getting thicker? What\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Another sting. Etienne yanked another dart from the back of his neck and swore foully. The shooters were definitely behind them.</p> <p>His knees weakened. He didn\u2019t carry the autoinjector containing the antidote anymore. He hadn\u2019t thought there was a reason to. The human threat had been extinguished.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cPlease, Krysta. Just trust me on this. Go! Maintenant!\u201d</p><p>As his strength waned, he shoved her hard and turned to face his attackers.</p><p>Still dizzy, Krysta stumbled and fell to her hands and knees behind the building. The weapons Etienne had thrust into her arms hit the ground a moment before gravel abraded her palms.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Cursing, she dusted off her stinging hands, grabbed the weapons, and spun around, ready to blister his ears.</p><p>Etienne staggered, as if he had lost his balance. Turning back to face the way they had come, he gave her his profile. His eyes flashed a brilliant amber.</p> <p>Bullets slammed into his chest, the guns firing them barely making a sound. His body jerked again and again as blood sprayed from too many wounds to count.</p><p>Krysta stared in horror. \u201cEtienne!\u201d</p><p>The first wave ended.</p><p>He turned his head, met her gaze. \u201cRun, damn you!\u201d he growled. Blood poured from his mouth and down his chin. Drawing his swords, he roared and leapt forward, out of sight.</p><p>Krysta\u2019s feet glued themselves to the ground. She couldn\u2019t move. Couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>He had pushed her out of the way to save her. If Etienne hadn\u2019t shoved her behind the building, she would have been shot to death beside him.</p><p>Her body began to shake uncontrollably.</p><p>He could have run. He could have left her there for whoever the hell it was to kill her.</p><p>Screams lit the night. The gunfire resumed.</p><p>Krysta transferred one of her swords to her left hand, drew out her cell phone, and dialed with shaking fingers.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d her brother answered on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d she hissed. \u201cNow. Behind . . . Shit!\u201d It took her a moment to get her bearings. \u201cWe\u2019re in Research Park behind . . . or on the side of that Environmental Whatever Building. Just find me. Come quiet and stay low. Someone\u2019s shooting at us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust come now! Please! And hurry!\u201d</p><p>Pocketing the phone, she drew in a deep breath (which wasn\u2019t nearly as calming as she had hoped it would be), gripped her weapons, and headed for the edge of the building.</p><p>Crouching down, she peered around it.</p><p>Soldiers?</p><p>Men garbed in black camo and armed to the teeth with silencer-equipped automatic weapons were doing their damnedest to kill Etienne. Only they didn\u2019t seem to actually want to kill him. They seemed to want to slow him down or weaken him with blood loss and whatever was in those darts.</p><p>And it was working.</p><p>Another dart hit Etienne in the throat even as he broke two soldiers\u2019 necks.</p><p>He staggered, grabbed another soldier and sank his teeth into his throat.</p><p>Krysta\u2019s mouth went dry.</p><p>She\u2019d known all along he was a vampire, but seeing him drink blood . . .</p><p>The other soldiers evidently viewed their associate as expendable, because they continued to shoot.</p><p>Etienne used him as a shield while he drank and fired the man\u2019s automatic weapon at the same time.</p><p>His victim sank to the ground, sightless eyes staring up at the sky.</p><p>Another dart struck Etienne in the arm.</p><p>He lurched sideways. Shook his head drunkenly.</p><p>Oh shit.</p><p>There were still three soldiers left.</p><p>Two moved in for the kill or to capture him or whatever the hell the plan was.</p><p>Krysta dropped her swords and drew two daggers. Without giving herself time to think, she stepped into the open and let them fly. One dagger struck a soldier in the throat. The second sank into another soldier\u2019s heart. The third soldier turned his gun on her and fired. She ducked behind the building and hit the ground. Brick and mortar showered down on her as the high-caliber bullets passed right through the building.</p><p>A yelp split the night.</p><p>The bullets stopped.</p><p>\u201cKrysta!\u201d</p><p>Relief poured through her at the raspy call, bringing tears to her eyes. \u201cEtienne!\u201d</p><p>Scrambling to her feet, she peered around the corner of the building.</p><p>Every soldier was down.</p><p>Etienne still stood. Barely. Blood saturated his clothing. Dozens of holes perforated his shirt and coat and pants.</p><p>He stumbled forward a step and dropped to his knees.</p><p>As Krysta limped toward him, she looked around, praying no more soldiers would leap out of the darkness and start shooting.</p><p>\u201cC-call your brother,\u201d he wheezed. Fumbling in his pocket, he muttered something in French.</p><p>Just as she reached him, he collapsed backward onto the pavement.</p><p>Something clunked to the ground by his hip. A cell phone.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on his way,\u201d she said, kneeling beside him. \u201cCan I call someone for you?\u201d</p><p>She picked up his phone and heard the telltale squeak of their car\u2019s brakes, though her brother approached as quietly as he could.</p><p>Etienne closed his eyes and mumbled something else in French.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d Damn it. Why hadn\u2019t she studied French in high school?</p><p>\u201cKrysta?\u201d Sean whispered.</p><p>\u201cOver here!\u201d she hissed as loudly as she dared, terrified that more men might be lurking nearby.</p><p>Nearly silent footsteps approached. \u201cOh shit,\u201d her brother swore. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome help me,\u201d she ordered. Tucking Etienne\u2019s phone in his coat pocket, she scooted around to cup his broad shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThose don\u2019t look like vampires,\u201d Sean said as he joined her, his eyes on the fallen soldiers.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t. They\u2019re humans, and they tried to kill us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs?\u201d He looked down at Etienne. \u201cIs that . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Grab his feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. He\u2019s a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he saved my ass. Again. Come on. Grab his legs. We need to get the hell out of here before more of those guys come along.\u201d</p><p>Etienne\u2019s head lolled as they hefted his heavy form and began carting him to the car parked behind the building.</p><p>\u201cIs he dead?\u201d Sean huffed.</p><p>Etienne wasn\u2019t disintegrating, so . . . \u201cNo. They drugged him with something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd shot him all to shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But he does. As soon as he saw the tranquilizer dart . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cHe knew what was coming.\u201d Crap, he was heavy. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything or see anything. All of a sudden he just shoved me behind the building. Then they opened fire and he fought them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he just run? They\u2019re human. They\u2019d never catch him. And they can\u2019t shoot what they can\u2019t follow.\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze and said nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re saying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe fought them to buy me time to get away. They would have killed me, Sean. They would\u2019ve shot me, too. They tried to shoot me.\u201d</p><p>He looked as confused as she felt.</p><p>Together they managed to cram Etienne\u2019s long, muscled body into the backseat.</p><p>Sean slammed the door. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Running back to the soldiers, she paused and swallowed hard. Creeping forward, she leaned down, grasped the bloodied handle of one of her daggers, and yanked it out of the dead soldier\u2019s throat. The other\u2019s lifeless eyes seemed full of accusation as she pulled her dagger out of his chest.</p><p>When she turned around, she found Sean staring at her somberly.</p><p>\u201cKrysta, did you . . . ?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t meet his gaze. Limping forward, she circled the car. \u201cJust get us out of here.\u201d</p><p>The silence that filled the car as they drove away hurt more than her throbbing head did.</p><p>Tonight she had done something she never would\u2019ve thought she could do. Something she didn\u2019t know how she could justify.</p><p>Tonight she had killed humans to protect a vampire.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s too long for the futon. Put him on my bed.\u201d Krysta raced for the bathroom while Sean carried Etienne into her bedroom. Grabbing the vinyl shower curtain, she yanked it down and hurried after him.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She jerked the top covers back, spread the curtain over the bed to protect the mattress from bloodstains, covered it with a sheet, then stood back. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Sean dumped Etienne on the bed.</p><p>Etienne didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure he\u2019s still alive?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>Biting her lip, Krysta leaned down and pressed two fingers to Etienne\u2019s blood-slick throat. A long moment passed in which her heart slammed against her ribs and Etienne\u2019s didn\u2019t appear to do anything at all. \u201cI don\u2019t feel anything.\u201d Throat thickening, she feared she might burst into tears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Had he died protecting her?</p><p>Sean said nothing. Face impassive, he moved to the opposite side of the bed, bent over, and felt for a pulse himself.</p><p>Minutes passed. Krysta didn\u2019t know how many. But with each, she felt shakier inside and more ready to scream with panic and regret and everything else building inside her.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s alive,\u201d Sean pronounced. \u201cHis pulse is so slow he would be declared dead in a hospital, but it\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>Despite her attempts to stop them, a few tears spilled over her lashes. Krysta sank onto the side of the bed, all of her aches and pains making themselves known in a big way now that she wasn\u2019t completely distracted.</p><p>\u201cBefore we get into what happened tonight,\u201d Sean said as he strolled around to stand before her, \u201ctell me where you\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p><p>She scrubbed her hands down her face and hoped he hadn\u2019t noticed the tears. \u201cMy head is the worst. I think I might have a concussion.\u201d</p><p>Sean closed his eyes a moment, then cupped his large hands around the back of her head. Seconds later, they heated and the pain slowly disappeared. \u201cWhat else?\u201d he asked, teeth clenched against the pain that now bombarded him.</p> <p>\u201cNothing that can\u2019t be patched up with Band-Aids, butterfly closures, and a few stitches.\u201d Healing the head wound would have taken enough out of him that any cuts or gashes he healed on her now would open on his own body. She wouldn\u2019t let that happen. After the mess she had just brought down on their heads, she wouldn\u2019t make him bleed, too.</p><p>\u201cGo shower. I\u2019ll stitch you up when you get out.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, she grabbed some clean clothes from her dresser. \u201cDo you want to lie down for a while?\u201d His head must be killing him.</p><p>He gave her a grim smile. \u201cI can\u2019t. Someone needs to watch our guest.\u201d</p><p>Krysta said nothing.</p><p>What could she say? She had just welcomed one of the vampires she had sworn to kill into their home and placed them both in danger.</p> <p>Heading into the bathroom, she closed the door.</p><p>The hot water stung her open cuts like salt, making her want to scream as she hurried through her shower. The most she would permit herself, however, was a grunt or two.</p><p>Damn, it hurt!</p><p>And rushing things didn\u2019t help. She couldn\u2019t be careful with wounds when she was dragging a rough, soapy washcloth across them as quickly as possible because she feared what her brother might do to Etienne if she took too long.</p><p>Or what Etienne might do to Sean, if she weren\u2019t there when he awoke.</p><p>If he awoke.</p><p>She barely took the time to dry off before hurriedly donning a sports bra, tank top, panties, and shorts. Leaving her hair to air-dry in whatever tangled mess it had acquired, she grabbed a smaller towel, held it to the thigh that still bled sluggishly, and hobbled back to her bedroom.</p><p>Sean had dragged one of their sagging director\u2019s chairs into the room and sprawled in it, his gaze shifting from the television to Etienne and back.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t look up when she entered. \u201cNothing on the news yet.\u201d</p><p>Jeeze. She hadn\u2019t even thought of that. But how could what had happened tonight not make the news? A dozen or more soldiers killed in what would be deemed a firefight on an elite college campus?</p><p>Just what kind of soldiers had those men been? Military? SWAT?</p><p>Crap. What if surveillance cameras had caught it all on tape? She knew where most of the cameras on the various college campuses were positioned and lured vampires away from them so she could destroy them without witnesses. But cameras could have caught her going into the loading area just before the fight broke out. They could have caught her and Sean loading Etienne into the car and fleeing the scene.</p><p>What had she done?</p><p>\u201cYou need to tell me what happened tonight,\u201d Sean said in a low, don\u2019t-fuck-with-me voice. \u201cAll of it. And you need to tell me everything else that has been going on.\u201d His gaze went to Etienne, then rose to meet hers. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve clearly been holding out on me.\u201d</p><p>And he deserved more than that. After all he did for her, all he sacrificed for her . . .</p><p>Nodding, Krysta started to sit on the side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cNo. Sit here. I need to see to your other wounds.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t even noticed the first-aid bag on the floor beside him.</p><p>Krysta crossed to him and turned her back to show him the wound in her thigh as he rose.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it with vampires and hamstrings?\u201d he muttered as he knelt behind her and went to work.</p><p>It seemed to be one of their favorite places to strike.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She gritted her teeth as he began to stitch the wound.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d he prodded.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been following me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vamp on the bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Ever since the first night I encountered him, he\u2019s been following me and taking out the vampires I lure away before I can engage them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you haven\u2019t come home battered and bloodied lately?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHe kills the vamps before I can even draw my weapons.\u201d</p><p>A pause. \u201cYou should have told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know. Not for sure. Not until last night. I knew vampires were following me, I was sure they had taken the bait. But when I spun around to confront them, they were gone just like on the other nights. I heard the sounds of a struggle a few blocks away and ran like hell to see what was happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the time I caught up, there was nothing but a pile of clothes. He had already killed them.\u201d</p><p>Quiet enfolded them as Sean stitched. It must have been a longer and deeper cut than she had supposed.</p><p>\u201cI confronted him. Goaded him into showing himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliant,\u201d he groused.</p><p>She\u2019d let that slide, knowing worry spawned it.</p><p>\u201cDid he say why he killed them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he was protecting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a vampire and you\u2019re a vampire hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He finished torturing her with the needle and applied a bandage.</p><p>Exhaling a deep sigh of relief, Krysta turned around and sank gingerly into the chair. \u201cHe wanted me to stop hunting. He said it was too dangerous and couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019ve been doing it for so long without getting myself killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve been doing it so long without getting yourself killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart-ass.\u201d</p><p>He grunted.</p><p>\u201cHe said he\u2019s been hunting vampires himself for two hundred years, Sean.\u201d</p><p>He glanced up at her as he retrieved some butterfly closures. \u201cTwo hundred years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would a vampire hunt other vampires? Is it a territorial thing or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said it wasn\u2019t, but wouldn\u2019t go into it. And tonight . . .\u201d She didn\u2019t want to think about it.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened, Krysta?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI played my usual Victim Here role, lured some vampires behind the building where you found us, and confronted them before Etienne could snatch them away.\u201d</p><p>He nodded at their guest. \u201cI assume he\u2019s Etienne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They called him an immortal guardian, and thought I was something called a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But they were afraid of him and pissed at him all at the same time. And I can see why. There were six vampires and he took out most of them with no help from me and again saved my ass. Then, all of a sudden, someone shot him in the neck with a tranquilizer dart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires can be sedated? Shit. I didn\u2019t even think of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t either. As soon as he saw the dart, Etienne told me to run and shoved me behind the building. Then the soldiers you saw appeared and shot him all to hell. They would have killed me, Sean, if he hadn\u2019t saved me. If he had run, they would have come after me. But he stayed and fought and took those bullets so I would have time to get away.\u201d</p><p>He sat back. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Why would a bunch of human soldiers want to kill you, another human? I mean, if they\u2019re vampire hunters like you, wouldn\u2019t they want to protect you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they believed I was a second\u2014whatever that is\u2014 like the vampires did. Either that or they wanted him and thought I was expendable. Hell, maybe they thought I was his Renfield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he wanted to save you, why didn\u2019t he just toss you over his shoulder and run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he was already too weak. Or maybe he was afraid they\u2019d shoot me before he could get us out of range. Or maybe he just wasn\u2019t thinking straight because of the drug.\u201d</p><p>He went back to work. \u201cAnd your daggers?\u201d</p><p>How had they ended up in the throat and heart of two human men?</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t let them kill him or capture him after he sacrificed himself to protect me.\u201d</p><p>Sean sighed. \u201cWere they military?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t identify themselves. Didn\u2019t shout, Halt! Don\u2019t move! Police! Army! SWAT! Nothing. They just opened fire.\u201d</p><p>Zipping his bag closed, Sean sat back on the floor. \u201cWhat a mess.\u201d He dragged his hands down his face. \u201cI can\u2019t think straight. My head is fucking killing me.\u201d</p><p>Guilt suffused her, as it always did when he suffered physical pain after healing her wounds.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan?\u201d he asked wearily. \u201cWhat are we going to do with Count Chocula over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Rising, Sean stared down at the unconscious vampire. \u201cImmortal guardian,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they called him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis wounds aren\u2019t healing. He probably needs blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d kinda like to keep mine where it is, particularly since I lost some tonight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He loosed a tired laugh. \u201cYeah. Me, too. I guess I should patch him up since he saved your stubborn, reckless ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you would.\u201d</p><p>Krysta helped him remove Etienne\u2019s coat, weapons, and shirt.</p> <p>Both swore when they saw just how many bullet holes he sported.</p><p>Krysta didn\u2019t know how he could still live. The vampires she usually hunted often died from blood loss. And Etienne had lost a lot of blood.</p><p>They moved on to his shoes and pants.</p><p>Sean\u2019s lips twitched.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked as she tugged off a heavy boot.</p> <p>\u201cDid you know your boy here\u2019s ringtone is \u201cI Feel Pretty\u201d?</p><p>She frowned and smiled at the same time. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis phone rang while you were in the shower.\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, a female voice filled the air, singing, \u201cI feel pretty! Oh so pretty! I feel pretty and witty and gaaaaaay!\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Krysta retrieved Etienne\u2019s phone from his pocket and opened it just as it stopped ringing.</p><p>\u201cIt must have gone to voice mail,\u201d Sean said, peering at it.</p> <p>\u201cIf it rings again should I answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd bring another vampire down on our heads? I don\u2019t think so. At least not yet.\u201d</p><p>They stripped Etienne down to a pair of black, silk boxer shorts.</p><p>Although he had a beautiful body, trim and rippling with muscle, Krysta had a hard time admiring it. Blood coated nearly every inch of him, having poured from so many bullet holes. Even his legs were littered with them.</p><p>Sean swore.</p><p>Krysta nodded.</p><p>None of the wounds still bled. Neither did they heal. Some of the holes even appeared to still contain the lead that had carved them.</p><p>\u201cWe need soapy water and some towels,\u201d Sean said, staring down at his patient. \u201cA butt-load of them.\u201d</p> <p>Krysta nodded. It was going to be a long night.</p><p>Lisette nibbled her thumbnail as she stared at the unconscious immortal male wrapped in titanium chains. Apparently he hadn\u2019t yet awoken, so Roland and Sarah were off hunting while Lisette took second watch.</p><p>Lisette didn\u2019t know who the mysterious immortal was, but he fascinated her.</p><p>He lay on the floor where Roland had dumped him, his wavy, raven hair shielding much of his face. A face she had not minded staring at in the least these past few weeks as she had spied upon him.</p><p>He was strikingly handsome. And so somber. Sad almost. Or maybe lonely? Ami always managed to lure a smile from him, even if only a small one.</p><p>Her eyes strayed to his wings. Those beautiful wings.</p><p>Only a few feathers peeked out from the blankets and chains.</p><p>Was he an immortal? Or was he something else? Something a little more . . . angelic?</p><p>She hadn\u2019t posed the question to the others, knowing how ruthlessly Roland would have mocked the notion. But the idea just wouldn\u2019t leave her.</p><p>Easing closer to the male, she cautiously leaned in and sniffed his neck.</p><p>His scent was . . .</p><p>She sighed.</p><p>So good. He smelled like she remembered her father\u2019s country estate used to when she was a girl. Like spring rain. Fresh and clean and new.</p><p>She smiled. With a hint of the fruity lollipops Ami had given him last night.</p><p>What she didn\u2019t smell on him was the virus. Which didn\u2019t necessarily mean anything. As Roland had pointed out, she couldn\u2019t smell it on Seth either. Or David. Or some of the other elder immortals who had lived a great deal longer than she had.</p><p>Her gaze returned to his wings.</p><p>Still . . .</p><p>Her cell phone chirped.</p><p>Jumping, she shook her head at herself and stepped back from the captive as she retrieved the phone.</p><p>\u201cOui?\u201d she answered when she saw it was Richart.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from Etienne tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was wounded earlier, judging by the pain I felt, and I haven\u2019t been able to reach him.\u201d</p><p>The twins had always referred to the unique bond they shared in much the same way the fictional character Adrian Monk described his own ability: It was a gift . . . and a curse.</p><p>It sucked that they felt each other\u2019s pain. And only pain. They never felt each other\u2019s pleasure, which\u2014now that she thought of it\u2014would be awkward now that Richart had wed and made frequent love to his wife.</p><p>The bond did come in handy, however, in times like this when one might be injured and require aid.</p><p>\u201cDid you try Cam?\u201d Surely Etienne\u2019s Second would know something.</p><p>\u201cCameron hasn\u2019t heard from him and is making discreet inquiries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy discreet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Something\u2019s been going on with Etienne, something he\u2019s been keeping from us. You\u2019ve noticed how distracted he\u2019s been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I assumed it was a woman, but could glean nothing from his thoughts. He has kept them from me of late.\u201d</p><p>And usually did so when he took a lover. Not that such had happened often over the past two centuries. Immortal/human love affairs never ended well.</p><p>\u201cShould I call Seth?\u201d he asked, that question telling her more than anything else how concerned he was.</p><p>\u201cWould you have wanted Seth to hunt you down when you were with Jenna, recovering from your wounds the time you were tranqed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s your answer. Give it a little more time. If Etienne was wounded badly enough, he may simply be sleeping too deeply for the phone to awaken him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me when you hear something. And tell Jenna hello for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he said, a smile entering his voice.</p><p>Lisette had only recently met her new sister-in-law and had never seen her brother as content and quick to smile as he had been with the former single mother. Not since his transformation anyway.</p><p>Guilt, an ever-present companion, stirred.</p><p>Lisette ended the call and returned her cell phone to her pocket.</p><p>Sighing, she focused her attention once more on the prisoner.</p><p>And found him staring up at her with piercing brown eyes.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>\u201cI feel pretty! Oh so pretty!\u201d</p><p>Krysta jerked awake.</p><p>\u201cI feel pretty and witty and gaaaaaaay!\u201d</p><p>Sitting up in the director\u2019s chair, she winced and rubbed her aching neck. She must have fallen asleep.</p><p>Her gaze went to Etienne.</p><p>He lay as he had ever since she and Sean had finished cleaning and bandaging his wounds. Still as death. The rise and fall of his chest so faint it seemed an illusion.</p><p>She reached for the cell phone she had dropped on the battered table beside her. Sean shuffled into the room, eyes puffy from sleep, boxers and T-shirt as rumpled as his short, black hair.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your head?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s someone named Richart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to answer it or let it go to voice mail?\u201d</p><p>Glancing at Etienne, she answered the call.</p><p>Before she could say one word, a slew of French poured over the line. Biting her lip, she waited for it to end.</p><p>An expectant pause ensued.</p><p>Diving in, Krysta asked, \u201cDo you speak English?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the man replied in a voice and accent very similar to Etienne\u2019s. \u201cWho is this? Where did you find this phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the owner\u2019s pocket. Who is this?\u201d she countered.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>She looked at Sean, who watched her with furrowed brow. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m his brother.\u201d</p><p>Not what she had been expecting. \u201cVampires have brothers?\u201d she asked, realizing the moment she said it what a stupid question it was. Of course they did. They had all been human once. It was just hard to remember that once they turned monstrous.</p><p>Sean\u2019s eyebrows flew up as he mouthed, \u201cHis brother?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>A tense silence followed.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d she asked at length.</p><p>\u201cIf you have harmed him in any way,\u201d the man began, his deep voice so full of menace that she felt a twinge of fear.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d She thought she heard a sigh of relief. \u201cBut someone else has. And I\u2019m a little worried that they might come after us.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded, sharing her concern.</p><p>They still had seen nothing about it on the news and didn\u2019t know whether that was a good thing or a bad thing. Both feared it was bad.</p><p>\u201cHow sorely is he wounded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure he needs blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you give him any?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm . . . no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you know what he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you mean, do I know he\u2019s a vampire, then yes.\u201d</p><p>Another long pause. \u201cTell me where you are located.\u201d</p><p>Covering the phone, she whispered, \u201cHe wants to know where we are.\u201d</p><p>Sean looked as uneasy as she felt. \u201cI don\u2019t know . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is there with you?\u201d Richart demanded.</p><p>\u201cMy brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. If Etienne was a two-hundred-year-old vampire and Richart was his brother, then Richart must be a vampire, too. What if Richart planned to bring a few of his bloodsucking friends? What if they didn\u2019t share Etienne\u2019s rare desire to protect humans?</p><p>\u201cYou hesitate,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m just not used to trusting vampires, okay? How do I know you won\u2019t bring a horde of others along with you and kill us both?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t need a horde of others to kill you,\u201d he responded simply.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>\u201cHoney,\u201d she heard a woman say in the background with an American accent, \u201cif you\u2019re trying to reassure her that you won\u2019t hurt them, saying things like that won\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>Krysta raised her eyebrows.</p><p>Sean mouthed, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he has a girlfriend,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cEtienne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He\u2019d better not. \u201cHis brother.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wait. Why should it matter to her if Etienne had a girlfriend?</p><p>\u201cI shall come alone,\u201d Richart tried again. \u201cUnarmed. You may arm yourself however you will.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Etienne, so still and pale.</p> <p>Hoping she wasn\u2019t making a huge mistake, she gave Richart their address.</p><p>Sean left the room, then returned in jeans with two holstered 9mms, socks, and sneakers.</p><p>Krysta rose and reached for a shoto sword.</p><p>Richart repeated her address. Krysta heard typing in the background.</p><p>\u201cHere it is,\u201d the woman with Richart said.</p> <p>\u201cIs there a satellite image of it? Or a street view?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe closest street view,\u201d the woman said, \u201cis this. A gas station a couple of miles away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, my love.\u201d</p><p>Krysta could have sworn she heard them kiss.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d the woman cautioned.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d he murmured. Then louder to Krysta, \u201cOne moment, please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sean asked, tying his laces.</p><p>\u201cThis is so weird.\u201d She had never really thought of vampires as anything other than monsters.</p><p>A laugh came over the line. \u201cIt worked,\u201d Richart said, with a great deal of surprise in his voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen your front door.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Krysta strode past Sean into the den and crossed to the front door.</p><p>Her hand tightening on her sword, she glanced back.</p> <p>Sean stood in the doorway of her bedroom, one Ruger aimed at the door, one aimed at Etienne.</p><p>Krysta turned the lock with the hand holding the phone and opened the door. Tilting her head back, she eyed the figure standing on the front porch.</p><p>A mirror image of Etienne stared back.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap,\u201d she whispered. \u201cRichart?\u201d</p><p>The vampire\u2019s gaze moved past her to take in her brother and the rest of their tiny abode. He drew in a deep breath, nostrils flaring, then nodded. \u201cMay I come in?\u201d</p><p>Swallowing, she stepped back.</p><p>Richart nodded to Sean, who nodded back, but didn\u2019t lower his weapons.</p><p>Krysta closed the door. \u201cEtienne is in there.\u201d</p><p>Richart\u2019s boots thudded loudly on the worn wood floor as he strode toward the bedroom.</p><p>Sean eased back into the room, never shifting his aim from the two vampires.</p><p>\u201cSean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Richart said, surprising her. \u201cI understand.\u201d Once in the room, he leaned down over his brother and drew back the sheet. \u201cHis wounds are not healing?\u201d All were covered by bandages.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEtienne, mon fr\u00e8re?\u201d</p><p>No response.</p><p>\u201cHow deep are the cuts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot cuts,\u201d she corrected. \u201cBullet wounds.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her sharply, then glanced at Sean. \u201cYour weapons have not been fired tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t us,\u201d Sean confirmed. \u201cI removed the bullets, but didn\u2019t stitch the wounds because they weren\u2019t bleeding. I just bandaged them instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have my gratitude,\u201d Richart uttered with a bow. Turning back to his brother, he peeled one of the bandages back and muttered something in French.</p><p>Krysta fervently wished she knew French.</p><p>Richart took his brother\u2019s forearm in his hands and raised Etienne\u2019s wrist to his lips. As he parted his own, fangs descended.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Krysta protested.</p><p>He met her gaze. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lost enough blood, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Richart considered her for a moment, then seemed to come to some decision. \u201cOur fangs are like needles. They siphon the blood of anyone we bite directly into our veins and, if necessary, can infuse others with our blood.\u201d</p><p>Sean lowered his aim slightly, medical curiosity brightening his face. \u201cReally? So you can transfuse him just by biting him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Richart bent his head and sank his fangs into his brother\u2019s wrist.</p><p>Krysta shared a Holy Crap! look with Sean.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long at all, which was actually frightening. If he could infuse his brother with blood that swiftly, then he could drain a human that quickly, too.</p><p>As could Etienne.</p><p>Lowering his brother\u2019s arm, Richart systematically removed all of Etienne\u2019s dressings. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said, \u201cfor caring for him and bandaging his wounds.\u201d</p><p>The mortal siblings nodded.</p><p>The male even holstered his weapons.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d Richart couldn\u2019t resist asking. They clearly weren\u2019t Seconds or other members of the human network or they would have known Etienne wasn\u2019t a vampire.</p><p>\u201cHe saved my life,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI would have died tonight if it weren\u2019t for him.\u201d</p><p>Ah. \u201cA vampire attacked you?\u201d</p><p>She shared a look with her brother. \u201cSssssssort of. But they weren\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than one vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. There were six. But we took care of them.\u201d</p><p>Tossing the bandages in a nearby rubbish bin, Richart stared at her. \u201cYou fought alongside him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just me. My brother came later and got us out of there.\u201d</p><p>Richart stared down at Etienne. Odd that there were so many bullet holes. Vampires usually stuck to blades like the immortals, knowing\u2014even in their madness\u2014that attracting too much mortal attention would likely lead to their demise.</p><p>Etienne\u2019s wounds slowly began to close and heal. Neither human expressed the amazement Richart would have expected upon seeing such.</p><p>Hmm.</p><p>Etienne looked much better, but it took longer for his wounds to close than it should have. And he wasn\u2019t rousing.</p><p>Richart nudged him. \u201cEtienne.\u201d</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>The healing sleep could be deep.</p><p>Richart shoved him hard. Hard enough to wake him even from a healing sleep. \u201cEtienne! REveiller!\u201d</p><p>Still nothing.</p><p>\u201cSomething is wrong,\u201d he muttered, his concern mounting.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s the drug,\u201d the woman said.</p><p>Richart\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe drug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drugged him?\u201d Fury rushed through him. Only one drug existed that could knock out an immortal like this. And, if these two possessed it, it meant they were the enemy.</p><p>An enemy who should have been destroyed months ago.</p><p>Both mortals took a cautious step back as his eyes began to glow.</p><p>The male raised his weapons.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the woman blurted. \u201cWe didn\u2019t drug him. That\u2019s what I was trying to tell you. The vampires weren\u2019t the biggest threat tonight. It was the soldiers who arrived after we defeated the vampires.\u201d</p><p>He swore. \u201cSoldiers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDescribe them.\u201d</p><p>She did, and told him everything that had happened from the time the vampires had been defeated to Etienne being felled.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019est impossible,\u201d he whispered. They had eradicated the mercenary threat. Completely. Darnell had erased all of the computer files and cyber files. Seth and David had wiped the memories of those they had allowed to live. The rest of the mercenaries had been killed.</p><p>It just wasn\u2019t possible. They had left no dangling threads.</p><p>Immortals didn\u2019t even carry the tranquilizer antidote with them anymore because no one was supposed to have that drug. No one but the researchers at the network, and none of them would use it against one of the immortals they aided.</p><p>The woman shifted, easing her weight off one leg. \u201cWho were they?\u201d She had limped when she had followed him into the room. She must have been injured, too.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask your name,\u201d he said, still reeling.</p><p>\u201cKrysta Linz. This is my brother Sean.\u201d</p><p>Richart performed an abbreviated bow. \u201cRichart d\u2019Alen\u00e7on.\u201d There was only one way to confirm that this drug was the same one the mercenaries had used against them. \u201cPlease excuse me for a moment. I will return shortly.\u201d</p><p>Too shaken to worry about their reaction, he teleported to his home. \u201cSheldon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d His young Second entered Richart\u2019s bedroom, holding a sandwich in one hand. As soon as he caught Richart\u2019s expression, he sobered. \u201cOh shit. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have any of the tranquilizer antidote left?\u201d Richart asked as he gathered a change of clothes for Etienne.</p><p>Nodding, Sheldon set the sandwich down and left the room. Richart followed him to the bathroom in which Sheldon kept much of their first-aid paraphernalia.</p><p>A solitary autoinjector was stashed in one of the drawers.</p><p>Jenna appeared in the doorway as Sheldon grabbed it and handed it over without a word.</p><p>Richart didn\u2019t think he had ever seen the young man look so worried. \u201cThank you.\u201d He met Jenna\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cIs it Etienne?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded. Knowing she would understand if he explained later, he teleported. Returning to his brother\u2019s side, Richart dropped the clothing on the bed.</p><p>Krysta and Sean jumped at his reappearance.</p><p>Removing the cap, Richart pressed the autoinjector to Etienne\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cIs that an EpiPen?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>Richart shook his head. An EpiPen wouldn\u2019t do squat to an immortal. They were unaffected by all but two drugs: The mercenaries\u2019 tranquilizer and the antidote Dr. Lipton had developed to counter it.</p><p>Turning the used autoinjector over and over in his hand, he waited.</p><p>Etienne opened his eyes.</p><p>The first thing he noticed was his brother looming over the lumpy bed that supported him. The second was Krysta and her brother.</p><p>As the lethargy induced by the tranquilizer rapidly faded, Etienne sat up and took stock of the situation. They were in the mortals\u2019 home, in Krysta\u2019s bedroom. Etienne wore only his boxer shorts, a bedspread covering him from the waist down. Instead of being riddled with wounds and stained red with blood, his body was clean, healed, and carried the pleasant citrus scent he associated with Krysta. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked, the words leaping from her lips as if she could no longer contain them.</p><p>He nodded. His gaze went to the autoinjector Richart held. \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d Etienne asked him.</p><p>\u201cKrysta answered your phone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes anyone else know you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJenna and Sheldon know I\u2019m with you, but not where.\u201d</p><p>Etienne turned to Krysta and her brother. \u201cI assume you got me out of there. Thank you. Both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saved my life,\u201d Krysta said. \u201cAgain. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>Richart held up the autoinjector and drew Etienne\u2019s gaze. \u201cWe have a problem.\u201d</p><p>A colossal understatement.</p><p>Etienne\u2019s eyes widened as a thought occurred. Oh shit. We have to call for a cleanup, he told Richart mentally. If humans haven\u2019t already found the bodies we left lying around, it will be a miracle.</p><p>Richart swore and tucked the autoinjector away. I\u2019ll go to Chris now. He glanced out the window. The sun will rise soon. Are you coming with me? Or are you going to stay and handle this? He glanced at their audience.</p><p>I\u2019ll stay. And do not give Chris this address. Or their names.</p><p>Etienne, they\u2019ve seen too much.</p> <p>And Jenna didn\u2019t get an eyeful when she was still mortal?</p><p>A muscle in his jaw twitched. Jenna could be trusted.</p><p>I believe Krysta and Sean can be, too. They saved my life. If that isn\u2019t an endorsement, what is?</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d Krysta broached, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on? You guys are looking kind of intense.\u201d</p><p>Just do what you can to appease Chris when you tell him what happened.</p><p>As you wish, brother. Call me if you need me.</p><p>Richart nodded at Krysta and Sean, then vanished.</p><p>\u201cThat is so cool,\u201d Krysta professed.</p> <p>Etienne smiled. \u201cYes, it is. I\u2019ve always envied him that talent.\u201d Rising, he reached for the black cargo pants Richart had brought him and tugged them on.</p><p>Krysta, he noticed, didn\u2019t even pretend not to watch him, her gaze roving him like fingers and making him wish her brother weren\u2019t in the room with them.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do it?\u201d she asked. Had she been the one who had undressed and bathed him?</p><p>\u201cTeleport? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is he the only vampire who can do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel pretty! Oh so pretty! I feel pretty and witty and gaaaaaay!\u201d</p><p>Etienne raised his eyebrows. What the hell was that?</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Krysta grabbed something off a nearby table and held it out to him. \u201cSorry. Here\u2019s your phone.\u201d</p><p>That was coming from his phone?</p><p>Sean\u2019s lips twitched.</p><p>Etienne frowned. \u201cDamn it. Who keeps changing my ringtone?\u201d He took the cell. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally!\u201d Cam said. \u201cWhere the hell have you been? Sheldon called and said you\u2019d been injured and tranqed. Or that he thought you had been tranqued.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was, but I\u2019m all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you? Do you need me to come and get you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Because Richart called, too, and he didn\u2019t sound too confident about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t go into details. What\u2019s the situation? What do you need me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Just sit tight. I\u2019ll fill you in when I return home at sunset,\u201d Etienne ordered, knowing his friend would chafe at having his hands tied.</p><p>\u201cFine. You\u2019re the boss,\u201d Cam griped. \u201cAnd, Etienne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichart told me to tell you Chris knows about the woman.\u201d</p><p>Click.</p><p>Merde.</p><p>Mind racing, Etienne tucked the phone into the back pocket of the pants Richart had brought him, then reached for and donned the T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d Krysta asked.</p><p>\u201cA friend.\u201d</p><p>Sean frowned. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t what happened at Duke tonight make the news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe kept waiting for someone to come after us or track us down,\u201d Krysta added.</p><p>Little did she know they would if Richart didn\u2019t succeed in cooling Chris\u2019s temper.</p><p>Sean swore.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Krysta asked with a frown.</p><p>\u201cI have to get ready for work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall in sick. Your head must still be hurting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. We need the money and I can\u2019t afford to lose this job if Ed gets a bug up his butt again.\u201d Sean crossed the room, pausing in the doorway to look back at Etienne. \u201cHarm my sister in any way and I will hunt you down and destroy you. Not a threat. A promise. And I won\u2019t play nice like she does. I\u2019ll do it during the day when you\u2019re vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>Etienne didn\u2019t mention that he wasn\u2019t physically weaker during the day as vampire folklore suggested. He may have to avoid sunlight, but he could still kick ass. Instead, he said. \u201cI\u2019ve no wish to harm her. Or you.\u201d</p><p>Sean delivered a jerky nod, then left to prepare for work.</p><p>For several long moments, Etienne and Krysta stared at each other.</p><p>\u201cAre you really okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAnd you? You were injured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. Sean patched me up.\u201d</p><p>And healed the worst of her wounds with his hands, Etienne assumed.</p><p>Her gaze slid to the digital clock on her bedside table. \u201cSean is running late. Let\u2019s put this on hold for a minute while I fix him some breakfast. I don\u2019t want him to go to work on an empty stomach after last night.\u201d</p><p>And Etienne had heard enough about their financial struggles to know Sean couldn\u2019t afford to pick something up in the drive-through on the way there.</p><p>He followed Krysta into the tiny kitchen and kept her company while she whipped up a breakfast of scrambled eggs, toast, and orange juice.</p><p>Sean demolished that in about a minute, then rushed out the door with a last warning look at Etienne.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised he left,\u201d Etienne admitted.</p><p>Krysta shrugged. \u201cMoney has been tight. School limits the number of hours he can work and vampire hunting limits the number of hours I can work. But we\u2019re making it.\u201d She put Sean\u2019s dish and glass in the sink and filled it with soapy water. \u201cYou\u2019re worried.\u201d</p><p>He watched her with some surprise. How had she known that?</p><p>\u201cYou were worried before the phone call, but afterward . . .\u201d She trailed off.</p><p>\u201cWe have a problem,\u201d he admitted. Chris knew about her. Even if Richart managed to stall him, Chris and his henchmen would come looking for her. And it would be best if Etienne were by her side when they found her.</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and I,\u201d he clarified.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. The soldiers we killed tonight have friends who are now out for our blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He\u2019d have to explain all of that, too. \u201cBut that\u2019s a whole different problem.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cSomeone else is out for our blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just yours. Figuratively speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour vampire friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy human friends.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows rose. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it would be best if I started from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a question I would like to ask you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Crossing her arms, she leaned back against the counter and stared up at him. Her hair was a little mussed, finger-combed into submission rather than brushed. Her face was free of makeup, and bore a couple of faint abrasions, one on her jaw and one on her cheekbone, both on the left side of her entrancing face.</p><p>Her slender frame was garbed in a tank top and shorts that left her arms and shapely legs bare. Without her coat and assorted weaponry, she appeared so fragile. He still found it hard to reconcile this lovely, delicate mortal with the vampire hunter he had been observing for the past two weeks.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go?\u201d he asked, needing to know.</p><p>She tilted her head. \u201cYou mean when Sean left? Why didn\u2019t I leave with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. At Duke. Why didn\u2019t you run when you had the chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter you threw me behind the building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I stayed and fought so you would have time to get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why,\u201d she said, her gaze never leaving his. \u201cYou could have escaped. Even tranquilized, you probably could have gotten away fast enough to elude them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey would\u2019ve killed you had I left. And the drug had already weakened me and slowed me enough that I couldn\u2019t toss you over my shoulder and run without risking you being shot. Or tranqed. I couldn\u2019t let either happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t let them kill you. Or capture you. Or whatever the hell they planned to do to you. I couldn\u2019t let you sacrifice yourself for me.\u201d</p><p>And that meant far more than it should have.</p><p>He eased closer to her. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her arms and shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her face in his large hands, heard her breath catch, her heartbeat pick up its pace just as his own did. Heat rushed through him at the simple touch. \u201cYou saved my life tonight,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Reaching up, she curled her small, soft hands around his wrists.</p><p>Etienne held his breath, waiting for her to pull his hands away. When she didn\u2019t . . .</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said.</p><p>As she nodded, he dipped his head and pressed his lips to hers.</p><p>Fire licked its way through Krysta\u2019s veins at the soft contact. Etienne caressed her cheeks as his silky smooth, surprisingly warm lips brushed hers.</p><p>What am I doing?</p><p>His tongue stroked her lips, tempting her into parting them.</p><p>What the hell am I doing? she repeated just before he deepened the kiss and she stopped thinking.</p><p>Her heart pounded in her chest, thudding against her ribs so determinedly she thought Etienne must feel it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If he didn\u2019t before, he did then as he moved forward, crowding her against the counter and pressing his large, muscular body into hers.</p><p>It felt so good. He felt so good. Tasted good. He even smelled good. Familiar. Bathed as he had been in the soap she used every day, the citrus aroma blending exquisitely with his own masculine scent.</p><p>As Etienne leaned into her, every muscle tightened, pleasure dancing through her everywhere they touched.</p> <p>He slid his arms around her. Heat simmered inside her, preventing Krysta from pulling away. Her breasts pressed against his hard, muscled chest. His rippling abs melded to hers. Her hips settled against his arousal.</p><p>I have to stop, the voice of reason intruded. He\u2019s a vampire.</p><p>His arms tightened as he continued to tease and tempt her with his tongue.</p><p>I don\u2019t sleep with vampires. I hunt them. I destroy them. I loathe them. Damn, he can kiss. I want to tear his freaking clothes off.</p><p>Krysta almost moaned a protest when Etienne drew back. Peeling heavy lids open, she stared up at him and caught her breath.</p> <p>His eyes glowed a brilliant amber. Sharp fangs peeked from between parted lips. And both totally turned her on because he looked like he wanted to devour every inch of her.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>A growl rumbled forth from deep in his throat as he lowered his head and stole another brief, hard kiss.</p><p>Oh, yeah.</p><p>Then he ruined it (and did her a favor, she would later grudgingly admit) by again withdrawing and taking three determined steps backward.</p><p>Her heart continued to pound. She noted with some chagrin that she was practically panting. And her body tingled everywhere.</p> <p>That would bother her a lot more if she hadn\u2019t noticed the large bulge straining against the front of his pants that told her more than words that he had been as affected as she had.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m not a vampire.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaid the man with the glowing eyes and glinting fangs. Not to mention the super speed and strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires are not the only preternatural beings who boast such characteristics.\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit. There were other preternatural creatures out there?</p><p>He shook his head and motioned to the futon. \u201cWill you sit with me so I might explain?\u201d</p> <p>Krysta nodded, a bit dazed, and followed him over to the futon.</p><p>They sat simultaneously and turned toward each other, knees touching.</p><p>She liked that their knees touched. Liked the casual contact as much as she had liked the kiss. And wondered where exactly along the way she had lost her damned mind.</p><p>Vampire. Vampire hunter. Remember? she mentally chided herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not vampire,\u201d he repeated, stretching an arm along the back of the futon. \u201cI\u2019m immortal.\u201d</p><p>Krysta stared at him. Weren\u2019t all vampires mostly immortal? Unless slain, that is? They didn\u2019t age or get sick, after all, and could withstand a lot of damage that would kill humans. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe difference is that vampires are human before their transformation. I and my immortal colleagues, on the other hand, were like you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart, already misbehaving from their recent make-out session, began to beat a little faster. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean. I\u2019m human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t. Or rather I assume you aren\u2019t because your brother isn\u2019t. Is he your full brother or your half brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy full brother. And he\u2019s human. We both are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t. You\u2019re different.\u201d</p><p>How did he know that? She hadn\u2019t said or done anything to reveal her peculiar gift. And tonight was the first night he\u2019d had any direct contact with Sean.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>A gentle smile curled his lips. \u201cDon\u2019t look so panicked, Krysta. If with anyone, your secret is safe with me. I\u2019m just like you. Or I was once. Born with special talents and abilities ordinary humans don\u2019t posses. In centuries past, we called ourselves gifted ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGifted ones,\u201d she parroted. Other than her brother and her parents, she had never met another gifted one before.</p><p>\u201cMy brother,\u201d Etienne continued, \u201cwas born with the ability to teleport. Yours was born with the ability to heal with his hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI followed you home that first night and watched him heal the worst of your wounds with a touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, like through the window?\u201d she demanded. What the hell else had he watched, the perve.</p><p>His face creased with a disgruntled frown. \u201cYes, but I\u2019m not a perv. I didn\u2019t watch you shower or anything. I just needed to know who you were. You tried to kill me, remember, and thought me one of the vampires you hunt.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. He had kind of nailed the perv thing right on the head. How had he known what she was thinking? Her face wasn\u2019t that expressive, was it?</p><p>\u201cMy sister and I were both born with the ability to read others\u2019 thoughts,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>Her mind went blank, then filled with a maelstrom of reactions and concerns and freak-outs.</p><p>He could read her thoughts? He had been reading them all along?</p><p>Fury, alarm, and a ridiculous feeling of betrayal barreled through her. \u201cYou read my thoughts?\u201d she came close to yelling. He must know, then, that he had intrigued her from the first night they had met. That she thought about him all the time. That she had, not five minutes ago, wanted nothing more than to strip him naked and roll around in bed with him.</p><p>The snake!</p><p>He held up both hands in a placating gesture. \u201cNot all of them. Not even most of them. Just a few here and there.\u201d</p><p>Her face must be turning as red as a raspberry because he seemed quite desperate to assuage her anger.</p><p>\u201cSome gifted ones, like yourself, have a natural defense and are difficult to read,\u201d he claimed.</p><p>\u201cHow difficult,\u201d she snarled, ready to kick his ass if he gave the wrong answer.</p><p>\u201cVery difficult,\u201d he hurried to reassure her. \u201cExtremely difficult. Sometimes I can\u2019t read you at all. Other times I only catch a word or two.\u201d</p><p>A word or two. That could be less incriminating, she supposed. Maybe her mind was closed enough that he didn\u2019t know she was attracted to him.</p><p>\u201cWell, no. I knew that,\u201d he said.</p><p>Mouth falling open, she stared at him in dismay. Hell. Did she have no secrets from him?</p><p>\u201cYou have many secrets from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop reading my thoughts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just . . . you\u2019re broadcasting them rather loudly at the moment and . . . There is no reason to feel embarrassed, Krysta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say! You weren\u2019t caught mentally checking out my package!\u201d</p><p>A startled laugh escaped him before he hastily quelled it. \u201cYou\u2019re attracted to me. I know that. But I\u2019m attracted to you, too. I have been ever since the first night I saw you when you stumbled out of that damned frat house, pretending to be drunk, turned your face up to the sky, and seemed to look right at me.\u201d</p><p>Her mind quieted. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And now I can\u2019t read what you\u2019re thinking at all, so if that offends you . . . Well, I won\u2019t apologize for it. You\u2019re a strong, beautiful woman who knows her way around a blade. I find that\u201d\u2014he drew in a deep breath as his eyes traveled over her with a heat that scorched her\u2014\u201cincredibly appealing. But I will apologize for whatever discomfort it causes you.\u201d</p><p>How the hell was she supposed to respond to that?</p><p>Best to just change the subject and try not to broadcast her thoughts, whatever the hell that meant. \u201cTell me again how immortals differ from vampires.\u201d</p><p>He did, beginning with gifted ones and blowing her mind. She and her brother and parents had always known they were different. But they hadn\u2019t known why. They hadn\u2019t realized they possessed advanced DNA.</p><p>And she hadn\u2019t known that vampirism was caused by a virus.</p><p>\u201cSo the virus causes brain damage and madness in humans, but not in gifted ones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect. Our advanced DNA protects us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere does the DNA come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Recalling all of the times she had been splattered with vampire blood, the time one had bitten her, and the long, wet kiss she had just shared with Etienne, she asked uneasily, \u201cHow contagious is this virus?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cFleeting contact with it won\u2019t transform you. A few drops of vampire blood mingling with yours in a wound won\u2019t infect you. And you can\u2019t get it from a kiss. Or from sex.\u201d</p><p>That was nice to know for future reference.</p><p>\u201cYou can only be transformed in two ways: By having most of your blood drained, then being infused with the blood of a vampire or immortal. Or by being fed from and exposed to the virus in small amounts repeatedly.\u201d He frowned. \u201cHave you ever been bitten by the vampires you hunt?\u201d The idea seemed to upset him.</p><p>\u201cOnly once.\u201d And it hadn\u2019t been a vamp she had been hunting.</p><p>Darkness swept his visage as his brown eyes flashed bright amber once more. \u201cDescribe the vampire who bit you.\u201d</p><p>Why should it thrill her that he wanted to hunt down the vamp who had sunk his filthy fangs into her?</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI killed him myself.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile lit his face as he wagged his head back and forth.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI like you more with every tidbit I learn about you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty likable yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that you know I\u2019m not a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were likable even as a vampire. It was very annoying.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, flashing those pearly fangs.</p><p>If he was infected with the same virus that vampires were, then he must need blood. She had even seen his brother bite his wrist and infuse him with her own eyes. \u201cIf you hunt vampires who prey upon humans, does that mean you don\u2019t . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKill humans myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She hadn\u2019t wanted to ask, in part because she wasn\u2019t sure she would like his answer.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feed from humans or prey upon them as vampires do. But, as you saw tonight, I will kill any human who threatens me or mine.\u201d</p> <p>Which had it been tonight, she wondered, me or mine? Then called herself a fool. \u201cBut, you do need blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I assume Richart gave me blood while I was unconscious?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHe, ah, bit your wrist and fed you or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormally we receive sustenance from blood bags. The humans who work with us also donate blood regularly, so we don\u2019t feed directly from humans unless extreme circumstances drive us to do so.\u201d</p><p>Drinking blood. Gross.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t drink the blood,\u201d he said. \u201cOur fangs carry it straight to our veins.\u201d</p><p>Right. That\u2019s what Richart had said. \u201cAre you reading my thoughts again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Your face sort of scrunched up with disgust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry about that.\u201d It wasn\u2019t his fault he needed blood.</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>Damn, he was handsome when he smiled.</p> <p>Hell, he was handsome when he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Etienne leaned forward a bit. \u201cListen, about the humans who aid us . . .\u201d</p><p>It was so weird, hearing that there were other humans out there who knew about all of this. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir top priority is to protect us, to protect immortals, or Immortal Guardians as they call us.\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t that sort of backward? The weaker mortals protecting the powerful immortals? \u201cThey protect you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They have a vested interest in doing so. After all, we\u2019re the only thing keeping vampires from slaughtering humans unchecked. And we\u2019ve been fighting to protect humans for millennia. So, the network\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe network?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we call the organization of humans who aid us. The network not only provides us with blood, it protects our identities and keeps the general public from finding out that vampires, immortals, and gifted ones exist. Our ability to hunt and destroy vampires would be severely inhibited, if not halted altogether, if mankind learned about us and began to hunt us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t they help you if they knew? Why would you think they would . . . ?\u201d A sickening dread soured her stomach as she recalled the way those soldiers had gone after Etienne earlier. \u201cIs that what happened at Duke? Humans found out about you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe dealt with another such threat recently, but quashed it. I\u2019m certain we quashed it. The attack tonight should not have happened. Should not even be possible. No mortals outside of the network should know about us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept, those solders did. And . . .\u201d Oh, crap. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d He shifted the arm resting on the back of the futon and cupped her shoulder in his large hand. The warmth of it still caught her off guard. She had assumed vampires\u2014and immortals now that she knew about them\u2014would be cold to the touch.</p><p>\u201cThe network is going to want to talk to you,\u201d he told her somberly. And the concern on his face made her nervous. She had thought vampires were the biggest threat to her. His face said something different.</p><p>\u201cYou say talk,\u201d she voiced. \u201cI hear interrogate and make disappear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Because you look worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried.\u201d He looked away, muttered something in French, then turned back to her. \u201cAll right. I won\u2019t lie to you. I am worried. The head of the East Coast division of the human network can be ruthless when it comes to protecting us from perceived mortal threats.\u201d</p><p>Alarm rose. \u201cYou aren\u2019t reassuring me. Are you saying I should run? That we should run? Because Sean knows about this, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t run. It wouldn\u2019t do you any good. Chris could find a white dove in a blizzard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is Chris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHead of the network.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to scare you, Krysta. As long as you don\u2019t view us, Immortal Guardians, as the bad guys and start hunting us, then everything should be fine. In fact, once Chris finds out you\u2019re both gifted ones and that you can successfully hunt vampires, he will likely want to recruit you.\u201d</p><p>That was a lot to take in. And could potentially be a good thing. How cool would it be to have other people working with her to eradicate the vampire menace? And to maybe even get paid for it?</p><p>Paid. Awesome.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds pretty good, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it does,\u201d he agreed. \u201cYou and Sean would fare much better if you worked for the network and had their support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you look happy about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause until he assures himself that you and your brother pose no threat to us, Chris will be a hard-nosed bastard and I don\u2019t want him to upset you.\u201d</p><p>Etienne was upset because he didn\u2019t want her to be upset?</p><p>That was so sweet. It made her feel all mushy inside. And made her wonder . . . \u201cWhy?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy would it bother you so much if I were upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and fingered a strand of her hair. \u201cBecause I like you far more than I should.\u201d</p><p>Her heart began to pound once more. \u201cYou say that like it\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>And she thought it wasn\u2019t? She had spent the past six years hunting down and destroying men infected with the same virus that infected Etienne. She was pretty much going on faith here that he wasn\u2019t like them, though his words and actions were pretty damned convincing. Plus . . .</p><p>He was immortal.</p><p>She was mortal.</p><p>Liking each other too much could have some serious consequences.</p><p>He gave her a faint smile. \u201cYou mimicked my thoughts so closely I may as well have spoken them aloud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop reading my thoughts,\u201d she murmured without heat or anger.</p><p>\u201cStop broadcasting them,\u201d he said, equally hushed. \u201cYou haven\u2019t told me your gift, Krysta.\u201d</p><p>She did not want to go there. \u201cCould we maybe save that for another time?\u201d Everyone she had ever told (outside of her family\u2014and there had been precious few) had thought her a nutcase.</p><p>\u201cIf you wish. But you will receive no mockery or condemnation from me when you do. I\u2019ve dealt with the surreal and paranormal all of my life. Very little surprises me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Hoping he would be the one person who wouldn\u2019t think she either needed a straitjacket or was bullshitting, she drew in a deep breath, ordered herself not to feel hurt if he laughed, and said, \u201cI can see auras.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAuras. The glowing colors some say surround people? Those are real?\u201d</p><p>She breathed a little easier. He sounded curious, not doubtful. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does that help you hunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only mortals who can hold their own in battles with vampires are gifted ones whose particular talents give them some kind of edge. How does reading auras help you?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, wanting to tell him, but . . .</p><p>He smiled. \u201cNot quite ready to trust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is all a lot to take in. I just don\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said, touching her shoulder again. \u201cI understand and can wait for you to tell me in your own time.\u201d He winked. \u201cNo need to share all of our secrets at once.\u201d</p><p>Which implied he thought they would be spending more time with each other and could share secrets later.</p><p>The notion pleased Krysta far more than it should.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>\u201cWho are you and why are you sniffing after Ami?\u201d</p><p>Zach raised an eyebrow at the question and fought back a smile when Roland\u2019s wife grimaced.</p><p>\u201cReally, sweetie? You couldn\u2019t have worded that a little less . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOffensively?\u201d Lisette suggested.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Roland grumbled, scowling. \u201cAnswer the question. What do you want from Ami?\u201d</p><p>Zach arched a brow. \u201cLollipops?\u201d</p><p>Sarah grabbed Roland\u2019s arm and stopped him as he drew back a foot to level a powerful kick Zach\u2019s way. \u201cHoney, you know Seth doesn\u2019t like fighting amongst the ranks. What\u2019s he going to do if this one shows up bloodied?\u201d</p><p>Roland glared at Zach. \u201cHe\u2019s immortal. As long as I don\u2019t remove a limb, he\u2019ll heal before Seth sees him.\u201d</p><p>Zach felt Lisette\u2019s gaze. She had been quiet since he had awakened. The second time. He had awoken this morning, but, upon realizing she had gone, had feigned unconsciousness all day until sheer boredom had coaxed him into sleeping for real. When he had opened his eyes the second time, she had been standing nearby, talking to her brother on the phone.</p><p>Her pulse had picked up a bit when she had noticed he was awake. Unfortunately, the only words she had spoken before her friends\u2019 arrival had been into the phone to Roland, alerting him to Zach\u2019s return to consciousness. The rest of the time she had merely studied Zach silently with those piercing, light brown eyes.</p><p>And, much to his confusion, Zach had found studying her as entertaining as engaging in conversation.</p><p>\u201cAre you immortal?\u201d she asked, finally speaking to him directly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It was an honest answer, he told himself.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t smell the virus on you,\u201d she stated.</p><p>He shrugged, rattling the heavy chains. \u201cCan you smell it on Seth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to answer his questions, Lisette,\u201d Roland uttered. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a free exchange of information. It\u2019s a demand for it.\u201d</p><p>Lisette\u2019s brow furrowed.</p><p>Sarah tilted her head. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>Zach looked at Roland. \u201cOld enough to make him seem young.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Roland demanded.</p><p>Zach was curious to learn the source of that one\u2019s hostility. Lisette seemed curious. Sarah seemed worried. Roland seemed as furious as though he had caught Zach trying to catch a glimpse of Sarah naked.</p><p>\u201cZach.\u201d May as well tell him the truth. If Seth read their minds and thought one of the Others had been snooping around, all hell would break loose. Best to let him know who it was, though Zach doubted Seth would be pleased. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried that I\u2019m pursuing Ami romantically\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s married, asshole!\u201d Roland shouted.</p><p>\u201cI know, asshole.\u201d</p><p>Roland\u2019s face mottled with anger a second before he slammed his fist into Zach\u2019s temple. And Roland didn\u2019t pull the punch since he knew Zach was immortal.</p><p>Ouch. Despite the pain, this was actually turning out to be very entertaining.</p><p>\u201cStay away from her,\u201d Roland warned as the women looked on anxiously. They seemed more inclined to reason with Zach and coax him rather than take Roland\u2019s hot-tempered\u2014</p> <p>Wait. Wasn\u2019t there an infidelity in Roland\u2019s past?</p><p>Zach sneaked into Roland\u2019s mind and gave his past a quick look.</p><p>Yes. His first wife had cheated on him with his brother. That clarified things a bit. Roland loved Marcus like a brother and didn\u2019t want to see him go through the same pain of being cuckolded. Roland didn\u2019t want to believe Ami would deceive Marcus like that, but had learned the hard way not to trust his instincts.</p><p>\u201cFirst, don\u2019t do that again,\u201d Zach warned. He\u2019d give the guy one shot, but that was it. Any more and all bets would be off. \u201cSecond, Ami is a friend,\u201d Zach said. And damned if something didn\u2019t shift inside him at the admission.</p><p>Had he ever had a friend before?</p><p>\u201cWe know you\u2019ve been meeting her regularly. If you\u2019re hoping she\u2019ll be a friend with benefits,\u201d Roland warned, \u201cthink again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what that is.\u201d</p><p>Sarah\u2019s eyebrows rose.</p><p>Lisette continued to study him somberly.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of benefits?\u201d Did they think he thought rubbing elbows with Ami would help him score points with Seth? That was a joke.</p><p>\u201cSexual,\u201d Roland snapped.</p><p>Zach scowled. Sex had never even occurred to him. \u201cA friend you sleep with isn\u2019t a friend. It\u2019s a lover. I told you, Ami is a friend.\u201d</p><p>Sarah stepped in and asked in her soft, lilting voice, \u201cThen why do you meet with her in secret? Why not talk with her inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think we talk? Have you ever heard us?\u201d</p> <p>Lisette shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m telepathic. I know the signs of unspoken conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you hear a conversation?\u201d he asked curiously. How powerful was this young immortal?</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cCan you read my thoughts?\u201d That would be an impressive feat.</p><p>He felt her probing, trying to enter his mind. He had thought it would annoy him. It sure as hell annoyed him when Seth tried to read his thoughts. Yet, for some reason, it didn\u2019t. He actually found himself rooting for her to succeed, which made no sense at all. He really didn\u2019t want her to see what was in there.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she blurted, her lovely features dark with frustration.</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps we were merely sharing lollipops as you no doubt observed.\u201d Which raised the question . . . \u201cHow did you learn of our meetings?\u201d Even Seth and David had not noticed his comings and goings.</p><p>\u201cI followed Ami outside and saw the two of you together,\u201d Lisette answered.</p><p>\u201cIs Ami aware you\u2019re surveilling her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing it?\u201d</p><p>Had she guessed what Ami is and didn\u2019t trust her? Did she fear Ami? Did she wish her ill?</p><p>\u201cI worry about her,\u201d Lisette answered hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cYou barely know each other,\u201d he pointed out. An intense fear of strangers had been instilled in Ami by her torturers, making it difficult for her to get to know others. So, while she cared about all of her immortal family, she was only personally close to a handful of them.</p><p>And Lisette was not one of them.</p><p>Roland and Sarah eyed Lisette curiously.</p><p>Lisette looked increasingly uneasy. \u201cAll right. What I say does not leave this room.\u201d</p><p>Both immortals nodded, then looked at him.</p><p>\u201cYou trust my word?\u201d he asked with some surprise.</p><p>\u201cIf you repeat whatever Lisette tells us, next time we won\u2019t drug you while you aren\u2019t paying attention, we\u2019ll decapitate you,\u201d Roland warned.</p><p>Zach shrugged. \u201cAll right.\u201d He didn\u2019t mention that there wouldn\u2019t be a next time. They wouldn\u2019t be able to sneak up on him again. He was shocked that they had done it this time.</p><p>Lisette shifted. Clearly she didn\u2019t want to talk about whatever it was that had driven her to follow Ami. \u201cEver since we found out that Ami was the primary target of Emrys\u2019s mercenaries, Richart, Etienne, and I have been spending more time at David\u2019s place. As have you two.\u201d</p><p>Roland nodded. \u201cBastien breeched my home and took Sarah. I learned from that mistake and, despite my solitary nature, wanted to be there in case the mercenaries breeched David\u2019s defenses and tried to take Ami.\u201d</p><p>Lisette nodded. \u201cExactly. And often I would spend the day there, as would you two.\u201d</p><p>They nodded expectantly.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cMy gift isn\u2019t like Seth\u2019s and David\u2019s. Or rather it is, but I don\u2019t have the control over it they do. Seth and David only hear other people\u2019s thoughts when they wish to. Etienne and I, on the other hand, always hear other people\u2019s thoughts unless we consciously block them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks,\u201d Roland said.</p><p>\u201cYes, it does. And, when I sleep, I lose the ability to block others\u2019 thoughts. So, their dreams often become mine.\u201d</p><p>Zach began to dread where this was going.</p><p>\u201cIn all these years, I\u2019ve come to understand that there are three kinds of dreams. The first kind is a whimsical collection or rehashing of things that happened to us or things we thought about during recent days. If you watch the movie The Birds, for instance, you might dream about birds. If you\u2019re a student, you might dream about school. The second kind is like yours, Sarah. The dreams foretell the future or tell us something about the present that we may not know. And the third kind . . . In those dreams, we revisit the past.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what he had been afraid of. And what Seth probably hadn\u2019t realized or he would\u2019ve found a way to convince the telepaths they didn\u2019t need to sleep at David\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cDreams that revisit the past usually don\u2019t reflect it precisely. There will be elements of the past there, but whatever the event was won\u2019t just replay itself exactly as it happened. Ami\u2019s . . .\u201d She looked away. \u201cAmi\u2019s reflect her past exactly. They don\u2019t deviate at all.\u201d</p><p>Roland frowned. \u201cHow do you know? I thought you didn\u2019t meet Ami until Seth brought her to North Carolina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has the same dreams over and over again and they are more detailed than any dreams I have ever been in. Only pure memory could spawn those.\u201d</p><p>Sarah frowned. \u201cWhat did you see?\u201d</p><p>Lisette swallowed hard. Moisture welled in her eyes. \u201cThey tortured her,\u201d she choked out. \u201cI mean they really tortured her. They . . . dissected her . . . and experimented on her over and over again while she was conscious. She felt every incision. Every burn. Every electrical shock. And, because she heals even more swiftly than Roland, she didn\u2019t die.\u201d</p><p>Sarah touched a hand to her mouth, horror filling her features.</p><p>Roland\u2019s face tightened with fury.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Sarah whispered. \u201cWhy would they do that?\u201d</p><p>Zach held his breath.</p><p>Lisette shook her head. \u201cThey must have found out she was a gifted one.\u201d</p><p>Relief rushed through him.</p><p>\u201cSeth was right to protect us all this time,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf you saw the things they did to her . . .\u201d She wiped her tears away impatiently. \u201cAfter only two or three days, I began to fear falling asleep.\u201d</p><p>Zach had the oddest urge to comfort her.</p><p>\u201cI had to start sleeping at home every few days just so I could get some rest without being locked into those nightmares.\u201d She turned her attention to Zach. \u201cThere was no way in hell I was going to let mercenaries get their hands on her again. I guess I became a little obsessed with her safety. And, even though Emrys is dead and rotting in hell, his colleagues Donald and Nelson are not. I know they should pose no further threat because Seth and David wiped their memories, but\u201d\u2014she shrugged and offered them all a sad smile\u2014\u201cI can\u2019t seem to shake my fear for her. So I followed Ami when she would go out alone at night and saw you with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas Etienne seen her dreams, too?\u201d Zach asked.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cHow do you know my brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know all of you.\u201d Not really. He knew their names and some of their backstories. Bits and pieces he had overheard during his visits and while listening to the Others grumble.</p><p>\u201cEtienne has seen the same dreams I have,\u201d she answered finally and looked at Roland. \u201cThat\u2019s why he has softened toward Bastien, by the way. Something else the dreams revealed to us is how gentle Bastien was with Ami right after her rescue. How much he helped her overcome the paralyzing fear those monsters instilled in her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe killed Ewen,\u201d Roland reminded her.</p><p>\u201cI know. But, if you could see how he is with her when no one else is around . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Zach persisted. \u201cYou saw nothing else in her dreams?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cThey weren\u2019t all memory-based. Some were the usual whimsical variety in which she looked up at the night sky and saw three moons instead of one. That sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>Which were likely just as memory-based as the others. Fortunately, neither Lisette nor her brother seemed to have figured that out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnyway, when I saw you with her, I asked Roland who you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t know,\u201d Roland said, \u201cso I began watching over Ami, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Sarah added.</p> <p>\u201cDoes her husband know you\u2019re spying on her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Roland admitted, \u201cand we want to keep it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Zach couldn\u2019t resist asking, \u201cbecause you\u2019re afraid Marcus might think you are sniffing after her?\u201d</p><p>Roland lashed out with his fist again, the force of the blow snapping Zach\u2019s head back.</p><p>And there went the fun.</p> <p>His own ire rising, Zach used a combination of telekinesis and brute strength increased by adrenaline to burst from his restraints. Restraints no one else in this room could have broken.</p><p>The others ducked as broken lengths of chain went flying.</p><p>The women\u2019s eyes widened as he spread his wings, the tips brushing the walls on either side of the room.</p><p>Roland drew swords and stepped in front of the women.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve indulged you enough,\u201d Zach said. \u201cHit me again and you will not survive my retaliation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Lisette asked, her eyes straying to his wings as they had so often.</p> <p>Did he have her to thank for the bedding that had protected them from the damaging chain links? He would peek into her thoughts, but generally disliked doing so. Most people were unaware of the ugly things that could reside in the darkest corners of their minds and he always seemed to find it.</p><p>\u201cCall Marcus,\u201d Roland ordered Sarah over his shoulder.</p><p>When she reached for her cell phone, Zach raised a hand to stop her. \u201cDon\u2019t. Marcus has enough on his plate. He doesn\u2019t need the added worry of this, and it truly isn\u2019t necessary. I mean Ami no harm.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated.</p><p>As did Roland. He even straightened from his fighting stance and lowered his weapons. \u201cAdded worry? What\u2019s going on with Marcus?\u201d</p><p>Sarah nodded, brow furrowed. \u201cWhat do you mean he has a lot on his plate? Is he worried about Ami, too?\u201d</p><p>That was an understatement. And not his story to tell.</p><p>\u201cIf Marcus wants you to know what\u2019s going on with them, he\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p> <p>That didn\u2019t improve Roland\u2019s mood. \u201cYou expect me to believe he told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Because he didn\u2019t.\u201d Zach shrugged. \u201cI hear things.\u201d</p><p>Sarah bit her lip. \u201cHas Ami refused to let Marcus transform her?\u201d</p><p>All those in the Immortal Guardian community who weren\u2019t in the loop thought Ami was a gifted one.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt isn\u2019t my place to say.\u201d Before anyone could speak again, he turned to Lisette. \u201cDon\u2019t pry into their thoughts, seeking answers. I know the temptation is great but\u2014as I said\u2014if Marcus and Ami want you to know, they will tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to,\u201d she said, face troubled.</p><p>All three of them looked troubled. More troubled now than they had when he had escaped his bonds.</p><p>Zach folded his wings in and tucked them against his back. His curiosity had been appeased. He\u2019d been entertained. Now it was over. \u201cI believe we\u2019ve said all there is to say.\u201d He headed for the front door.</p><p>No one moved to stop him.</p><p>He paused, one hand on the knob. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mention this to Seth, if I were you. He has a lot on his plate, too, and this will just piss him off.\u201d</p><p>Opening the door, he stepped outside and leaped into the sky.</p><p>Krysta started to konk out around noon. Etienne watched her yawn, then released a jaw-cracking yawn himself.</p><p>She gave him a sleepy grin. \u201cMade you yawn.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYes, you did. Why don\u2019t you go ahead and get some rest? You can\u2019t have actually slept in that chair while watching over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I may have dozed off once or twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not enough. You need rest. You were wounded tonight.\u201d He frowned. His own wounds had healed for the most part. Only a deep sleep or more blood would finish the job at this point. But hers . . . \u201cHow are your wounds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey hurt like hell, but I\u2019m used to it. What about you?\u201d She glanced at the bright sunlight outlining the faded window curtains. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of stranded here, aren\u2019t you, until sunset? Or will Richart be coming back for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I haven\u2019t worn out my welcome, I\u2019d like to stay. I trust Richart not to give away your identity or location. But Chris is like a bloodhound. Once he has the scent . . .\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI want to be here to run interference should his men find you.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cAre you sure Sean is safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The first thing Chris will do once he learns your name is track down your home address.\u201d And race to her doorstep. Hmm. \u201cPerhaps I should have Richart teleport us to . . .\u201d He thought for a moment. \u201cWhere would Chris not think to look? Our home in France?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to teleport me to France?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, one minute I would be here and the next I would be across the ocean in France?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a thought.\u201d</p><p>A long pause ensued. \u201cYou know, I just don\u2019t think I\u2019m up for that right now.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and touched her hair. \u201cIt has been a long night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think your human friends will burst in here and threaten me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might burst in, if you don\u2019t answer the door. But, with me here, they won\u2019t have the balls to threaten you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get some rest, too, then?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, but didn\u2019t think he would succeed even if he tried. The futon that barely kept their asses from hitting the floor was old and lumpy and badly needed to be replaced. \u201cI\u2019ll stretch out here on the futon, if you really don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to take Sean\u2019s bed?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cSean doesn\u2019t want me in the house. I doubt he would appreciate my confiscating his bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right on that, but he\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>Etienne smiled. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d He stood when she did.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She started to stretch, then winced and dropped her arms.</p><p>If he knew Roland better, Etienne would call him and ask him to heal her. Unfortunately, Roland had kept him\u2014and everyone else, save Sarah and Marcus\u2014at a distance. And really didn\u2019t trust humans.</p><p>Krysta headed for her bedroom. \u201cYou should know I\u2019m a very light sleeper, so . . .\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cDon\u2019t try to drink your blood while you sleep?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flushed guiltily. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never do so, with or without your permission, unless both of our lives depended upon it. I wouldn\u2019t want to risk infecting you.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him as if she truly wanted to believe him.</p><p>And he hoped she did. Or would. In time.</p><p>He bowed as she turned and entered her bedroom. He expected her to close and lock her door, not that it could keep him out.</p><p>Instead, she drew back the covers and climbed into bed.</p><p>Etienne turned off the overhead light and attempted to stretch out on the futon. His feet and most of his calves hung over the arm. One of the metal bars beneath the cushions dug into his back.</p><p>He sighed. He could always wait until Krysta drifted off, then sleep on the floor. That would probably be the more comfortable solution.</p><p>He heard bedding rustle and closed his eyes, trying not to picture Krysta sprawled across the covers under other, less appropriate circumstances.</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>Opening his eyes, he glanced at the doorway.</p><p>She was leaning over in bed, peeking at him. \u201cComfortable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith good intentions.\u201d</p><p>Still grinning, she waved him toward her. \u201cGo ahead and come sleep in here with me.\u201d</p><p>His body went rock hard at the notion even though he knew damned well she didn\u2019t mean it the way he wanted her to mean it.</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d want to rip your clothes off with my teeth, so I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea. \u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you, but . . .\u201d I really do want to rip your clothes off with my teeth and explore every inch of your beautiful body. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour legs are hanging off the end by a good foot and a half and I can\u2019t even sleep on that lumpy piece of crap when I\u2019m drunk.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve slept on worse surfaces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever slept in a coffin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but only as a practical joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about in a crypt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than once when it took me longer than expected to track down a nasty vampire and I couldn\u2019t find any other shelter before the sun rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas the crypt more comfortable than my futon?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cHands down.\u201d</p><p>Again she laughed. \u201cThen get in here. We\u2019re adults. We can do this.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t find the strength to refuse. \u201cMerci.\u201d Rising, he strode into her room and circled the bed. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you trust me enough to sleep beside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I am, too. You really aren\u2019t going to bite me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He settled beside her on top of the covers.</p><p>\u201cAny plans to cop a feel?\u201d</p><p>Her scent enveloped him as he turned his head to stare at her. \u201cWould you mind if I did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still considering that one.\u201d</p><p>Yes. This was definitely a bad idea.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it about you that makes me want to forget what you are,\u201d she asked softly, \u201cthat makes me believe you are what you are and not one of the vampires I hate so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Perhaps the same thing about you that makes me want to believe you won\u2019t drive a stake through my heart or chop off my head as soon as I doze off.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Curling onto her side to face him, she raised one hand and drew delicate fingers down his cheek as her gaze roved his face. \u201cTruce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Etienne.\u201d</p> <p>Heart racing, he clasped her fingers and brought them to his lips. \u201cGood night, Krysta.\u201d</p><p>She fell asleep holding his hand.</p><p>He wanted to stay awake and savor that. The sweetness of it. But the healing sleep swiftly claimed him.</p><p>Etienne dreamed vampires hunted him.</p><p>No. The vampires hunted Krysta. And the dream was hers. He could always tell when someone else\u2019s dream became his because he first saw them from that person\u2019s perspective. And he wasn\u2019t a slender, significantly shorter woman.</p> <p>Usually, he could separate himself from the dreamer and participate as he would in his own dreams. He had never been able to do that when Ami\u2019s dreams had seized him. He had been as much a victim of the atrocities committed against her as she had in those dreams and often dreaded sleeping when he stayed the day at David\u2019s.</p><p>As Krysta confronted the vampires and began to swing her shoto swords, Etienne left her form and joined in the fight as himself.</p><p>She grinned when she saw him. \u201cAbout time!\u201d she quipped.</p><p>Etienne laughed and engaged the vamps, who were much more organized and swung their weapons with greater control and accuracy in the dream.</p><p>A dozen vampires fell. Two dozen replaced them.</p><p>Then Sean arrived and was somehow thrust into the middle of everything.</p> <p>Krysta\u2019s brother had skills. But\u2014without whatever edge Krysta\u2019s ability to see auras gave her\u2014he fared badly, accumulating wound after wound as Krysta fought to get to his side.</p><p>The more panicked she became, the more wounds she suffered and the weaker she grew.</p><p>Etienne couldn\u2019t reach her. Every time he cut down one vampire a second took his place.</p><p>One vamp disarmed and captured Sean. Pulling him back against his chest, the vampire sent Krysta a cruel smile.</p><p>\u201cKill him!\u201d the others cried.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Krysta screamed.</p><p>\u201cRemember, the male is the one we\u2019re after,\u201d another voice said softly, strangely calm amidst the slaverings of the vampires. \u201cWe want the immortal alive. The human female is expendable.\u201d</p><p>What?</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt him!\u201d Krysta begged, her eyes still on her brother. \u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRendezvous with target in one mile,\u201d the same calm voice announced.</p><p>Etienne stopped fighting. Something was wrong.</p><p>The vampires converged upon Krysta, yelling and taunting. None spoke with the voice Etienne had heard.</p><p>The vampire holding Sean began to sing in a falsetto voice, \u201cI feel pretty! Oh, so pretty! I feel pretty and witty and gaaaaaay!\u201d</p><p>What the hell was with that song?</p><p>Krysta vanished.</p><p>Frowning, Etienne spun in a circle. \u201cKrysta?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEtienne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d He resumed fighting, doing his damnedest to reach her brother while the vamp who held him continued to sing in that weird high voice.</p><p>\u201cEtienne!\u201d</p><p>He looked around, but still couldn\u2019t find her. \u201cKrysta?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEtienne! Wake up!\u201d</p><p>He jerked awake.</p><p>Krysta knelt beside him on the bed, shaking the hell out of him. \u201cJeeze. It\u2019s a good thing I didn\u2019t want to stake you. You would have slept right through it!\u201d</p><p>Groaning, he sat up. \u201cI sleep deeper when I\u2019m healing. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cell phone has been ringing like crazy and that damned song is making me mental.\u201d</p><p>When the singing started up again, he yanked his phone out of his pocket and answered.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a serious problem,\u201d Chris Reordon said without preamble.</p><p>Damn it. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichart told me you left quite a mess at Duke tonight.\u201d</p><p>Etienne frowned. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we have a problem. I sent my cleaning crew over there ASAP and they didn\u2019t find dick.\u201d</p><p>Etienne stood, alarm striking. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was nothing. No bodies. No blood. No vampire clothing or bling. No dental fillings or caps. No humans freaking out. Nada.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible. There should have been a couple dozen bodies\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere weren\u2019t. There was, however, a large area of wet pavement where no sprinklers could reach. And the surveillance tapes for the security cameras in that area of the campus are all gone.\u201d</p><p>Etienne swore.</p><p>\u201cExactly. Where are you? Are you still with the woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang up, call Richart, and have him teleport you to safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t getting it. The group that attacked you now has the surveillance tapes. They also have connections or they wouldn\u2019t have been able to clean that mess up so quickly. They can use the tapes to trace the license plate on her car. They probably already know where you are. Get the hell out of there. Now.\u201d</p><p>Etienne looked to Krysta, who watched him with concern. \u201cWe have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere? Why?\u201d</p><p>Someone shouted something in the background on Chris\u2019s end of the conversation as engine noise flowed over the line. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d Etienne asked.</p><p>\u201cAt the network, getting into a Black Hawk with reinforcements. More will follow on the ground in a Humvee.\u201d</p><p>A twig snapped outside. Then another.</p><p>Etienne looked toward the window. \u201cToo late. They\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall Richart!\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Krysta stared at Etienne with wide eyes. Something was wrong. Really, really wrong.</p><p>He grabbed her arm and, practically lifting her off the bed, urged her into the den.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cRichart,\u201d he spoke into his phone. \u201cI need you . . . Yes.\u201d He pocketed the phone. \u201cDoes this place have a basement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, not really. There\u2019s a crawl space under the house that you can access from outside, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Etienne stopped short and looked toward the bedroom, then the kitchen, his head tilted as though he were listening to something.</p><p>Krysta remained quiet, but heard nothing save her heart slamming against her ribs.</p><p>Kneeling, Etienne dragged her down with him. While she fought for balance, he drew back his arm and punched through the floor as though it were cardboard. Half a dozen times. Knuckles splitting. Bones cracking.</p><p>Krysta gaped at the hole he created, an absurd thought rearing its head: No way were she and Sean going to get their security deposit back.</p><p>Without warning, Etienne picked her up and dropped her through the jagged hole.</p><p>She grunted as she hit the hard-packed dirt floor. It was only a four or five foot drop, but she didn\u2019t have time to twist around and use her hands to break the fall.</p><p>Then, as though they were in a Warner Brothers cartoon, Etienne landed on top of her, flattening her and stealing her breath.</p><p>Holy crap, he was heavy!</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he murmured in her ear as he rolled off her and sat up.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Bullets tore through the house overhead. Large bullets, judging by the debris flying around the den and the narrow rays of sunshine beginning to brighten the room.</p><p>Her mouth fell open.</p><p>Etienne rose into a crouch, eyes staring intently through the hole.</p><p>Richart appeared above them. His body jerked as bullets slammed into him.</p><p>Etienne lunged up and yanked his brother down into the crawl space with them.</p><p>Richart landed hard, too.</p><p>Etienne spoke urgently to him in French.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Krysta protested shrilly. \u201cNo way! You can\u2019t do that! You can\u2019t talk in French while I\u2019m sitting here freaking out because I don\u2019t know what the hell is going on!\u201d</p><p>Richart rolled onto his stomach and managed to get to his hands and knees.</p><p>She swallowed.</p><p>His head hung low. Blood dribbled from between parted lips as ragged breath wheezed in and out through them. The front of his shirt bore several holes, as did the back, and began to glisten as blood saturated it.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded, but didn\u2019t raise his head.</p><p>Etienne rested a hand on his brother\u2019s back. \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was . . . making love to my wife . . . not that it\u2019s . . . any of your . . . business. Did you . . . want me to show up here naked?\u201d</p><p>Etienne\u2019s gaze went to Krysta. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She had a feeling he would have said Hell, yes if she weren\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cTake my wrist,\u201d Etienne ordered.</p><p>Richart grabbed Etienne\u2019s wrist and sank his teeth into it.</p><p>A muscle leapt in Etienne\u2019s jaw.</p><p>Krysta knew from experience that being bitten didn\u2019t produce the ecstatic pleasure in real life that it did in movies that romanticized vampires. Rather, it hurt like hell, feeling as though someone had just stuck you with a couple of large needles.</p><p>Richart retracted his fangs and released his brother\u2019s wrist.</p><p>Bullets continued to fly back and forth overhead like psychotic bees, tearing her rented home apart.</p><p>She glanced again at Richart. A couple of misshapen lumps of metal fell out of his shirt and hit the ground as his wounds began to heal.</p><p>\u201cCan you teleport?\u201d Etienne asked.</p><p>Richart nodded and sat back on his heels.</p><p>\u201cGet her out of here,\u201d Etienne said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Krysta looked to Etienne as Richart reached out and gripped her shoulder.</p><p>The world darkened. Dizziness assailed her. She grabbed Richart\u2019s shirt.</p><p>Light burst into being, illuminating a lovely living room with modern furniture.</p><p>Krysta gasped. \u201cDid you just teleport me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui.\u201d</p><p>A pretty, petite woman with red hair and dark brown roots appeared before them, a white and purple aura swirling around her. Her face clouded with concern when her gaze landed on Richart. \u201cHoney . . .\u201d She took a step toward him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He raised a hand to hold her at bay and vanished.</p><p>She looked up at Krysta. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Krysta shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Someone was shooting the place all to hell and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSheldon!\u201d the woman called over her shoulder. \u201cJohn!\u201d She wore black cargo pants and a black T-shirt that hugged a narrow waist and full breasts Krysta would kill to have. Her hair was mussed and her face flushed, leading Krysta to believe this was the American wife with whom Richart had been making love.</p><p>Two men strode up a nearby hallway, coming from the back of the house. Both looked to be around twenty years old. One was roughly five eleven with bright red hair. The other was at least six feet with short, dark brown hair.</p><p>Krysta took a wary step backward, then another. She didn\u2019t know these people. She barely knew Etienne.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Mom?\u201d the brunet asked.</p><p>The other man\u2019s eyebrows flew up when he noticed Krysta. \u201cWell, hello,\u201d he said in a deep, flirtatious tone.</p> <p>She scowled. \u201cYou\u2019re hitting on me? Really?\u201d</p><p>Richart appeared with Etienne, who was pretty much holding his brother upright.</p><p>Krysta damned near sank to the floor with relief.</p><p>\u201cSheldon,\u201d Etienne said as the woman hurried forward, \u201cget the protective suits we wear in daylight. John, get Richart some blood. And bring some for me, too.\u201d</p><p>The redhead took off toward the back of the house. The brunet raced into a large adjoining kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHere, honey,\u201d the woman said, looping Richart\u2019s arm over her shoulder and taking his weight from Etienne, \u201clet me help you to the sofa.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled and nuzzled her ear. \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it looks. I\u2019m already healing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because you look like shit.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, then winced.</p><p>In all the years Krysta had been hunting vampires, she had never thought of one having a wife.</p><p>But they weren\u2019t vampires. They were immortals. Their every movement wasn\u2019t dictated by evil and insanity. The two actually seemed . . . loving. Warm. Affectionate.</p><p>Etienne stepped in front of her, blocking her view, and gently clasped her arm with his left hand. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, touched by the concern in his handsome face. \u201cYes. Just shaken, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and pulled her into a hug.</p> <p>Krysta leaned into him, letting her racing heart calm, her body stop trembling.</p><p>John returned from the kitchen. \u201cHere you go.\u201d</p><p>Etienne released her and took a bag of blood with his left hand.</p><p>Krysta frowned. He wasn\u2019t using his right arm. Or, more specifically, his right hand.</p><p>He gave her an uneasy look. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I have to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>He parted his lips.</p><p>She swallowed as fangs descended from his gums. Fangs he sank into the bag of blood.</p><p>Oh. Right. Gross.</p><p>I\u2019m not drinking it, he spoke directly into her head.</p><p>She jumped. \u201cAre you reading my thoughts again?\u201d</p><p>No. Your face said it all.</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>While he continued to syphon the blood into his veins or whatever, she took his right arm and carefully raised it so she could get a look at his hand.</p><p>It was a mess of cuts and bruises and who knew how many broken bones. Her little house may be all wood and look like crap on the outside but it had been built to last. Etienne had punched through flooring and heavy support beams alike.</p><p>She looked up at him and found him watching her. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>He lowered the now-empty blood bag and gave her a wry smile. \u201cLike a bitch.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at his use of her words and shook her head. \u201cYou saved my life. Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter endangering it. Those men weren\u2019t after you. They were after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m expendable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho were they?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I intend to find out.\u201d</p><p>Sheldon entered, his arms full of . . .</p><p>Krysta frowned. What the hell was that?</p><p>Stepping back, Etienne tossed the empty bag to John, then blurred.</p><p>Her eyebrows flew up when he stilled a second later, wearing only a T-shirt and boxers. The rest of his clothes formed a pile on the floor at his feet. \u201cWow.\u201d She unabashedly ogled his powerful biceps and strong, muscled thighs dusted with dark hair.</p><p>Richart\u2019s wife laughed.</p><p>Grinning, Etienne reached for the suit Sheldon held out to him. It reminded Krysta of a diving suit, except it appeared to have a rough texture, almost like that of a car tire.</p><p>Sheldon took another one to Richart, who rose. Both immortals blurred and donned the suits in only a second or two.</p><p>Sheldon himself donned a bulletproof vest and tugged on a helmet with a glass shield.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Richart demanded.</p><p>\u201cWith you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your Second. Quit bitching and let me do my job.\u201d</p><p>Etienne zipped from the room and returned with a mass of weapons. \u201cDo you have any of the antidote?\u201d</p><p>Sheldon shook his head, holstering a couple of Glock 18s with long-ass clips, then picking up an M16. \u201cNo. The threat was supposed to be over, so I didn\u2019t reorder any when we started running low.\u201d</p><p>The two brothers armed themselves in a blink.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my suit,\u201d Richart\u2019s wife asked.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have one,\u201d Richart responded.</p><p>\u201cShe could use Lisette\u2019s,\u201d Sheldon suggested.</p><p>\u201cNo, she can\u2019t,\u201d Richart snapped, glaring at his Second.</p><p>\u201cNo, she can\u2019t,\u201d Sheldon parroted. \u201cBecause Lisette, uh, didn\u2019t bring it back after the last time she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is still too new to you,\u201d Richart told her. \u201cYou haven\u2019t completed your training. I don\u2019t want you to get hurt.\u201d Leaning down, he pressed a kiss to her lips. \u201cJe t\u2019 aime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>Crossing to Etienne, he clapped a hand on his shoulder. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>Etienne nodded.</p><p>\u201cBe careful!\u201d Krysta blurted.</p><p>Etienne grinned as the two teleported away.</p><p>A second later, Richart reappeared, grabbed Sheldon\u2019s shoulder, then they vanished.</p><p>Silence fell.</p><p>Krysta looked at John, then Richart\u2019s wife. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>Richart\u2019s wife smiled, though worry shadowed her eyes. \u201cWe don\u2019t know much more than you do.\u201d Rising, she approached Krysta and held out her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Jenna. Richart is my husband. And John, here, is my son.\u201d</p><p>Krysta shook her hand. \u201cKrysta.\u201d She looked back and forth between John and Jenna, who looked as though they were about the same age. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Did you say he was your son?\u201d</p><p>Jenna laughed. \u201cYes. When I transformed, the virus healed all of the damage age had done to my body.\u201d She pointed to the dark roots that stood out against her red hair. \u201cSee? No more gray. I look like a kid again.\u201d</p><p>John shook his head and sent Krysta a wry smile. \u201cIt\u2019s weird, right? I\u2019m still trying to get used to it.\u201d</p><p>Jenna motioned for Krysta to sit with her on the sofa. \u201cSomething tells me you\u2019re the reason Etienne has been so distracted lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been distracted?\u201d</p><p>Jenna nodded. \u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>Good to know Krysta wasn\u2019t the only one. Etienne had been a major player in her thoughts since that first night she\u2019d encountered him. And her dreams. She hadn\u2019t had many sex dreams in her life, but wow. She had had a couple of doozies since meeting Etienne.</p><p>\u201cOh, wait.\u201d Jenna looked over her shoulder at her son. \u201cJohn, toss me my phone.\u201d</p><p>Krysta turned around in time to see John pick a cell phone up off the bar and sling it Jenna\u2019s way.</p><p>Jenna caught it easily. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I need to make a quick call.\u201d She dialed and held the phone to her ear. \u201cDarnell? Hi. It\u2019s Jenna. Richart and Etienne are\u2014\u201d She tilted her head. \u201cOh, he did? . . . No, they made it here safely.\u201d She looked at Krysta. \u201cShe made it safely, too . . . Our place . . . No, they put on protective suits and headed back with Sheldon . . .\u201d She lowered the phone slightly and addressed Krysta. \u201cAre you injured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d she said into the phone. \u201cOkay. Bye.\u201d She set the phone on the coffee table. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t think to ask you earlier. I\u2019m still pretty new to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m totally new to this. New to the immortal thing, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Darnell said Chris is on his way to your home with a small army. So Richart and Etienne will have help fighting whomever they\u2019re fighting.\u201d</p><p>Krysta nodded.</p><p>\u201cJohn,\u201d Jenna said with a smile, \u201cyou can go back to studying. They might be gone for a while.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cNice to meet you, Krysta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, too,\u201d she murmured, then turned back to Jenna.</p><p>Jenna smiled with pride. \u201cHe\u2019s pre-med at UNC.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Great. My brother\u2019s in med school there.\u201d Alarm shot through her at the thought of Sean. \u201cOh, shit. My brother.\u201d</p><p>Jenna leaned forward. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe live together. Those men were looking for Etienne, but they found him at our house. Do you think they\u2019ll go after Sean? Is Sean in danger?\u201d</p><p>Brow furrowing, Jenna reached for her phone again and dialed. \u201cDarnell? It\u2019s Jenna again. Krysta has a brother and is worried he might be in danger . . . Oh. He did? . . . Okay, good. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>She set her phone down again. \u201cChris took care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris?\u201d The same Chris Etienne expected to threaten her?</p><p>\u201cChris Reordon. Head of the East Coast division of the human network that aids immortals.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yep. Same one.</p><p>\u201cHe sent men over to guard your brother at work. No one will get near him.\u201d</p><p>Krysta stared at her. Guard or interrogate? \u201cCould I borrow your phone, please?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Krysta dialed Sean\u2019s cell.</p><p>\u201cKrys?\u201d he answered almost immediately.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cWhat the hell is going on? A bunch of Secret Service\u2013looking guys showed up, pulled me aside, and said they\u2019re friends of Etienne and are here to protect me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey are.\u201d She sure as hell hoped they were, anyway.</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019re freaking out my boss. They told Ed I\u2019m in a witness relocation program and that there may have been a leak. What the hell? Did something happen? Or is this about last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething happened. Etienne and I were sleeping and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit. Not together, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t sleep with him, did you?\u201d</p> <p>She looked at Jenna and turned away, lowering her own voice. \u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, \u201cbut all we did was sleep in the literal sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said we didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let your guard down with a vampire in the house!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t a vampire. He\u2019s an immortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. Some guys with guns showed up.\u201d</p><p>Sean swore again.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see them, but assume from the way Etienne and Richart were acting that they were like the soldiers or whatever last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked again.</p><p>\u201cYes. But the house is all shot to hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Etienne punched a big-ass hole in the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. There goes our security deposit.\u201d</p><p>Jenna laughed.</p><p>Krysta turned back around.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to listen. I\u2019m still getting used to the acute hearing thing and haven\u2019t learned how to tune things out yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cRichart\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires marry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t . . . Forget it. Listen, the bottom line is if the soldiers could trace us to our house, they could trace you to your job. So I guess Etienne sent his friends over there to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt Richart\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure you\u2019re okay? You haven\u2019t been fed on or brainwashed or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Sean. Just a little shaken up.\u201d</p><p>Someone spoke in the background. \u201cThat was Ed. I have to go. But keep me posted. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you believe this shit is happening, Krys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either. Be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>She ended the call.</p><p>Bastien stirred, smiling as the dream faded. He and Melanie had been riding through the countryside near the home in which he had been raised. The horses beneath them had been those he had cherished so much as a young man. The air had been sweet and unclouded by pollution. The land quiet, free of the noise of man and machine that assaulted his sensitive ears on a nightly basis now.</p><p>Little had changed on the estate since he was a mortal. He had made sure of that.</p><p>Bastien had not lived the pristine life the other Immortal Guardians had after being transformed. Seth had not come to him and trained him, found a Second to help him conceal his nature, or paid him a wage. Bastien had had to fend for himself.</p><p>He didn\u2019t resent it. How could one miss what one had never had?</p><p>He had simply done what he had to do to survive, which had included using his ability to feel other people\u2019s emotions and his newfound strength and speed to acquire the money needed to buy his family\u2019s ancestral estate and ensure it remained how he remembered it from happier times.</p><p>In the dream, he had been taking Melanie around to all of his favorite places. His favorite fishing spot as a boy. His favorite thinking spot as an adolescent. His favorite trysting spot as a young man.</p><p>As he stretched and woke fully, he decided he would have to take her there for real. Get away from everything.</p><p>If Seth would let him.</p><p>He grimaced. Going from leader to subordinate had not been easy and still chafed at times. But, if that was what it took to stay with Melanie, he would do it without complaint.</p><p>Or with little complaint.</p><p>Rolling onto his side, he reached for Melanie and found cold sheets.</p><p>Frowning, he lifted his head and followed the light to the corner of their bedroom.</p><p>Melanie sat at her desk, garbed only in one of his large T-shirts. Bathed in the light of a small lamp, she peered down at another of her thick medical books. Several more rested in piles at each elbow and clogged the floor-to-ceiling shelves beside the desk.</p><p>She leaned forward, one elbow resting on the wooden surface, while she scoured the text at preternatural speeds. Brow furrowed, she turned the page, read, turned the page, read, careful not to make a sound.</p><p>Bastien sat up, the sheet tangling around his waist. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>Jumping, she spun around. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Did I wake you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d He knew her well and didn\u2019t have to touch her to know her shoulders were knotted with tension.</p><p>She looked down, toyed with the corners of the book\u2019s pages.</p><p>\u201cMelanie? Talk to me, love. Tell me what\u2019s troubling you.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI\u2019m flying blind, Bastien.\u201d When she raised her head, her hazel eyes glistened with tears.</p><p>Swearing silently, he leapt from the bed and crossed to kneel at her side, unconcerned with his nudity. (She knew every inch of his body.) Reaching up, he cupped her face and caught the tear that spilled over her lashes.</p><p>\u201cEveryone is counting on me to carry Ami safely through this pregnancy,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019m flying blind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what you need and I\u2019ll get it for you. Tell me how I can help you and I will.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cChris and Seth have already seen to it that I have all the books and equipment I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll get you what you need beyond that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. That\u2019s just it.\u201d</p><p>Bullshit. He could feel the worry and fear coursing through her. She was stressed as hell and he would do whatever it took to help her.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Tell me your top three concerns and we\u2019ll see how to alleviate them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start with the fact that I\u2019ve never been pregnant myself and have never spent any time around pregnant women, so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s normal. The books only say so much. They say it isn\u2019t uncommon for some women to experience cramping during pregnancy, but I\u2019m not clear on how much. Is it constant or sporadic? Do they mean super mild, I\u2019m ovulating cramping? Or moderate, I\u2019m about to get my period cramping? Or full blown, where the hell are the painkillers cramping? How much is too much? How often is too often? When should I be concerned? How do I know what\u2019s normal and what might be a result of difficulties that could arise from Ami\u2019s being an alien, Marcus being an immortal, and the baby possibly being infected with the virus? Or from the difficulty women on her planet have carrying babies to term?\u201d</p><p>Bastien thought furiously. They needed someone with experience to be their guide. \u201cThe network employs thousands of humans. Surely one of them must be a . . . woman . . . female . . . I don\u2019t know what you call them . . . vagina doctor.\u201d</p><p>Melanie laughed. \u201cVagina doctor?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, relieved to have lightened her mood a bit. \u201cI\u2019ve had very little contact with doctors in my lifetime. You know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re called OB/GYNs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Seth wants Ami\u2019s being an alien to be kept secret, especially from the mortal employees. If any of them were captured and tortured\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth took care of that. The men who were hunting her are dead. And Seth wiped the memories of those with whom they sought to join forces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think he\u2019s going to let down his guard? Him or Marcus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re right.\u201d There must be something else. \u201cWait.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI have the answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll bring Jenna into the loop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichart\u2019s wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She has a son. She\u2019s been through pregnancy and can help you get a better idea of what\u2019s normal and what isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we brought her into the loop, we\u2019d have to ask her to keep secrets from the man she loves. I wouldn\u2019t feel right about doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll bring Richart into the loop, too. We don\u2019t necessarily have to tell them Ami\u2019s from another world. We can just tell them she\u2019s pregnant. That alone, they\u2019ll know, is cause for concern because we have no idea what the virus will do to a baby.\u201d</p><p>She looked thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to bring all of the local Immortal Guardians into the loop soon anyway. The cats and kittens will help conceal the baby\u2019s heartbeat, but how long do you think we\u2019ll be able to hide Ami\u2019s growing belly? She\u2019s tiny, like you, and weighs less than a hundred pounds. A thirty-pound weight gain is not going to go unnoticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. They\u2019ll all think our concern revolves around the virus. They won\u2019t know we\u2019re worried about alien and gifted one DNA mixing unless we tell them.\u201d She nodded. \u201cJenna would be a huge help. She could tell me all of the little things the books don\u2019t. Things that, in the human world, would be considered insignificant. The more information I have, the better I can monitor Ami and know normal from abnormal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He dropped his hand to her knee and squeezed it. \u201cGreat. So, what\u2019s your next concern? We can solve it, too.\u201d</p><p>Her frown returned. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a solution for this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think there was a solution for the other one either, but we came up with one. Come on. Let\u2019s hear it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Ami\u2019s regenerative capabilities. Her body heals as fast as yours does when you\u2019re at full strength.\u201d</p><p>Ami\u2019s regenerative capabilities actually exceeded that of most Immortal Guardians. When Ami had been tortured and the butchers had removed two fingers and two toes, the digits had grown back on their own. The most an immortal could do in that situation was hope that David or Seth could reattach them.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t her swift healing a plus in health matters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if something goes wrong with the delivery and I have to perform a C-section.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly. How will I keep her body from healing the incision while I operate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d He thought furiously. \u201cWhen Seth and David rescued Ami, the fuckers had cracked her chest open and were shocking her heart. How did they keep her from healing too quickly for them to work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe drug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what effect it might have on the baby. In strong enough doses, it will knock you out cold and slow your healing. Once you\u2019re given blood, your wounds heal, but you remain unconscious. And, while all encounters seem to suggest immortals can\u2019t overdose on it, vampires can. When given too strong a dose, they die. Any human given the drug dies instantly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we don\u2019t know what the baby is or will be: alien, immortal, gifted one, vampire, or a combination thereof.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo there\u2019s no way to predict what will happen if the baby is exposed to it. It\u2019s too risky to use.\u201d</p><p>There had to be something. If not something medical, then some power Seth or David could use. \u201cWait. When he was so pissed at me for putting Ami in danger, Seth must have used telekinesis or\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014a reversal of his healing abilities, because it felt like a fist was squeezing my heart. Maybe he and David could prevent her body from healing if it came to that.\u201d</p><p>Another thoughtful pause. \u201cYou may be right. I\u2019ll ask them.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou see? We\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d Rising, he took her hand and drew her up to stand before him. \u201cWe can do anything as long as we\u2019re together.\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him. \u201cI believe we can.\u201d Sliding her arms around his waist, she leaned into him for a hug.</p><p>Bastien held her for many long moments, so fucking glad they were together. He would do anything for her. Anything. And hoped she knew it.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to bed,\u201d he murmured into her hair. \u201cWe\u2019ll tackle number three tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, she let him guide her back to their king-sized bed.</p> <p>Chapter 8</p><p>Richart, Etienne, and Sheldon crouched in the crawl space beneath Krysta\u2019s house. Bullets still whizzed past overhead, and damned if it didn\u2019t look like a grenade had exploded in the small kitchen. Something had blown a hole in the floor over there.</p><p>Sheldon gaped at the chaos above them.</p><p>\u201cCan you believe this shit?\u201d Etienne muttered.</p><p>Richart shook his head. \u201cHow much damage do they think we can take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hell of a lot, apparently, but they must know Krysta can\u2019t.\u201d Fury ignited within him.</p><p>The ground beneath the house was uneven, so the crawl space was about five and a half feet high on one side of the house and only about a foot high on the other.</p><p>Richart stuck close to the ground and crept over to the vertical wood slats that enclosed them. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Etienne crawled over to him, Sheldon at his side.</p><p>\u201cSee? There in the trees just off the yard. There. And there. They have the house surrounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid bastards are risking shooting each other through the house.\u201d</p><p>Richart chuckled. \u201cThat would be convenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a farmhouse in the distance there, beyond the trees. If you teleport us there, we can come up behind them and take them out instead of bursting out of this place and giving them instant targets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d Richart looked at him a moment. \u201cIs Krysta the reason you\u2019ve been so distracted lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re pissed that they put her in danger, but don\u2019t follow Bastien\u2019s example. Try to leave a couple alive for questioning and read the mind of every man you can before you kill the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I must.\u201d</p><p>The brothers reluctantly donned the head coverings, which looked like rubber ski masks, then added shades and gloves.</p><p>\u201cI hate this shit.\u201d</p><p>Richart nodded. \u201cMakes me feel like I\u2019m suffocating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this fast, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Sheldon said. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>Etienne and Richart looked at each other and said, \u201cStay here and keep them busy.\u201d</p><p>Sheldon frowned. \u201cKinda boring, but I\u2019ll make it work.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Richart touched Etienne\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Sunlight bathed them as they appeared beside the farmhouse. In unison, they stepped back into the shade.</p><p>As younger immortals, they could not tolerate full sunlight without wearing the protective suits the network had designed. They wouldn\u2019t burst into flames or explode the way movie vampires did. They would instead quickly begin to sunburn, and things would go downhill from there.</p><p>Older immortals, at full strength, could withstand several minutes before they would begin to suffer consequences. David could endure several hours. Seth was completely unaffected by daylight.</p><p>Etienne envied him as he shifted in the uncomfortable suit. Damn thing chafed. \u201cYou take the west and north. I\u2019ll come up behind them on the east and sweep around to the south.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d Richart vanished.</p><p>Etienne raced eastward, entered the trees, and circled around to head back toward Krysta\u2019s house. Whoever this new group hunting immortals and vampires was, they were well funded and large. There were at least two dozen soldiers on this side of the house, arcing around to the south.</p><p>Someone on the other side cried out.</p><p>Etienne smiled. Richart had already gone to work. And few could compete with him in combat. How could you shoot or stab what kept disappearing?</p><p>Etienne swooped down on five soldiers who seemed intent on filling this side of the house with enough holes to make the damned walls collapse. Their thoughts focused on shooting blindly into the house, wondering if anyone was actually in the house, if this was just a bullshit mission, and if the guy who had just cried out had been hit by friendly fire.</p><p>The fact that the latter didn\u2019t seem to bother them much spoke volumes about their character.</p><p>Knowing the immortals needed information, Etienne tamped down his desire to make these pricks pay for trying to kill Krysta and knocked the first two unconscious. The other three spun around.</p><p>He caught a fleeting Holy shit! Vampires are real! thought before he accidentally hit the third one too hard and killed him.</p><p>The last two turned their weapons on him. Blood spurted from their chests as they jerked and danced like marionettes on strings and dropped their aim. One squeezed and held the trigger. A couple of mercenaries to the south cried out as they were hit.</p><p>Etienne heard Sheldon whoop and credited him with the hits. Don\u2019t get cocky, he spoke into Sheldon\u2019s mind. Stay low and stay mobile.</p><p>\u201cDude,\u201d Sheldon said over the racket, \u201cstay out of my head. You startled me so badly I nearly shot myself in the foot.\u201d</p><p>In the distance, Richart laughed.</p><p>Smiling, Etienne shook his head.</p><p>A quick scan of the mercenaries\u2019 minds as they fell and breathed their last told him nothing of their employers.</p><p>Determined to come out of this with something, he made his way to the south, taking out soldiers as he went. Thanks to the jackass who had shot his colleagues, several of the soldiers were looking his way as Etienne swept toward them. A few got in lucky shots. One managed to tranq him. But the antidote he had taken earlier, once injected, not only countered the effects of the drug already in his system, it had a prophylactic effect, protecting him from reaction to further exposure for several hours.</p><p>Fortunately for him, it still worked.</p><p>Etienne wasn\u2019t used to taking prisoners and kept instinctively striking killing blows.</p><p>Sheldon apparently hadn\u2019t mastered the shoot-to-wound mind-set either, killing as many as Etienne did. The boy may not be the brightest bulb, but he was damned proficient with a weapon.</p><p>Are you helping Richart at all? Etienne risked asking. His brother had not been dosed with the antidote. If he were hit with a tranquilizer dart, he would lose a lot of speed and strength. If he were hit with enough, he would go down.</p><p>\u201cRichart doesn\u2019t need help. He keeps popping up between two groups and the stupid bastards are panicking and shooting each other.\u201d</p><p>Nevertheless, keep checking on him. He doesn\u2019t have the antidote.</p><p>Sheldon laughed. \u201cOne of them just tranqed himself. Dumbass.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Etienne ignored the wounds opening on his body as bullets tore through flesh.</p><p>Wagner\u2019s \u201cRide of the Valkyrie\u201d rose in the distance, the music swelling as the whup-whup-whup of a helicopter approached.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d one of the mercenaries demanded, firing his weapon at Etienne as he looked up into the trees.</p><p>Etienne smiled. \u201cThe cavalry.\u201d He knocked the firearm from the distracted man\u2019s hand and punched him hard enough to give him a concussion.</p><p>The man dropped like a stone. As did two of his comrades.</p><p>The branches above Etienne began to thrash and sway as a Black Hawk helicopter slowed and hovered overhead. Ropes fell to the ground. Soldiers in green camouflage tumbled from the open doors and slid down the lines to land fluidly on their feet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A blond\u2014just under six feet tall\u2014issued orders with hand signals, sending half the troops to Richart\u2019s side of the house, then leading the rest to Etienne.</p><p>And still the music roared.</p><p>Bodies in a ready-for-anything crouch, tranquilizer guns loaded with the human dose of the tranquilizer aimed and ready to fire, network soldiers nodded to Etienne as they flowed past him.</p> <p>Mercenaries dropped like flies as tranquilizer darts found vulnerable throats.</p><p>Shaded by the trees, Etienne tugged off his protective shades, head covering, and gloves, and smiled as the blond strolled toward him. \u201cYou do like to make an entrance, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Chris Reordon grinned. \u201cMay as well have fun with it. Besides, it will help me with the coverup. Any calls the neighbors make to nine-one-one will be intercepted and they\u2019ll be told we\u2019re filming a movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t attract spectators?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIf it does, my guys will steer them away.\u201d</p> <p>The walkie-talkie on his shoulder squawked. \u201cLocation secure,\u201d a tinny voice declared. \u201cTargets down.\u201d</p><p>Chris reached up and pressed a button. \u201cSet up a perimeter and stay sharp. If they repeat last night\u2019s performance, they\u2019ll have a second team sweep in shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>The network guards began to check the downed men and call out their conditions.</p><p>\u201cDead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead.\u201d</p><p>Chris frowned at Etienne.</p><p>Etienne pursed his lips. He thought he had left some alive.</p><p>\u201cDead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlive. Pulse thready. Pupils blown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame with this one.\u201d</p><p>Chris sighed heavily.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Etienne asked, beginning to feel defensive. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means you hit them too hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not used to fighting humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spar with Cameron all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I spar with immortals. Cam spars with other Seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve fought humans in the past. Hell, we just fought a minor war with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we fought to kill. Vampires can take a punch. I can fight to wound them, crack their skulls, and they\u2019ll recover. How the hell would I know how hard I can hit a human?\u201d</p><p>Chris was silent for a moment. \u201cOkay, I see this is going to be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead,\u201d another guard called.</p><p>\u201cDead. Sheesh. What the hell did you do to this guy?\u201d</p><p>Etienne winced.</p><p>Richart approached\u2014tugging off his own shades, head covering, and gloves\u2014and stood next to Etienne. He was pretty blood-splattered. Had he run into the same problem?</p><p>\u201cDid you get anything from their thoughts?\u201d Richart asked.</p><p>Etienne shook his head, frowning as Richart weaved on his feet. \u201cAre you wounded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d He glanced down. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Maybe. A couple of gunshots. Why?\u201d</p><p>Sheldon walked up, looking as though he had rolled in a puddle of mud. Reaching up, he yanked a tranquilizer dart from Richart\u2019s upper back. \u201cDude, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Chris reached into one of the pockets on his thigh and drew out an autoinjector full of the antidote. Flicking off the lid, he jabbed it into Richart\u2019s neck.</p><p>Etienne took his brother\u2019s arm and steadied him until it kicked in. He gave Sheldon a once-over. \u201cWhat the hell happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome asshole shot the hot water tank. The water spilled down into the crawl space and muddied the shallow end. I had to take cover there after they figured out someone was shooting from the house.\u201d</p><p>Richart straightened.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d Etienne asked.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cDid you leave any men alive?\u201d Chris asked.</p><p>Richart sent him a sheepish look. \u201cYes, but your men seem to think I scrambled their brains.\u201d</p><p>Grumbling, Chris took out his cell phone and dialed. \u201cSeth? Chris. You have a minute?\u201d</p><p>The leader of the Immortal Guardians appeared beside Etienne, pocketing his cell phone. \u201cWhat\u2019s . . . up?\u201d He glanced around and swore. \u201cMercenaries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Etienne, Richart, Sheldon, and Chris responded.</p><p>Seth studied the house, the grounds, the bodies. He returned his attention to the younger immortals. \u201cGo home. Rest. And be at David\u2019s an hour after sunset tonight.\u201d</p><p>Etienne looked at his brother. \u201cDon\u2019t you want us to stay and tell you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what happened. Go home. And, Etienne, when you come to the meeting tonight, bring the woman.\u201d</p><p>Merde. Had he read Etienne\u2019s thoughts and seen Krysta? Seth was so powerful that he could do so without Etienne even knowing it.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the brother?\u201d Chris asked. \u201cWhat do you want us to do with him?\u201d</p><p>Seth eyed Etienne. \u201cWill you be going home or staying with Richart today?\u201d</p><p>Etienne consulted Richart. \u201cCan you teleport us to my place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He turned back to Seth. \u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>Seth nodded and told Chris, \u201cWhen her brother gets off work, provided no one comes looking for him before then, take him to Etienne\u2019s home. Ensure you aren\u2019t followed and can\u2019t be tracked. Station guards outside the home and around the property\u2019s perimeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that really necessary?\u201d Etienne asked.</p><p>\u201cWhich part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like it, but said nothing. One didn\u2019t argue with Seth.</p><p>Frowning, Seth looked up at the helicopter, made a brief motion with his hand, and stopped the music. \u201cShow\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Chris motioned for the helo to land.</p><p>\u201cGo home,\u201d Seth instructed the d\u2019Alen\u00e7ons.</p><p>\u201cShould I bring the brother to the meeting?\u201d Etienne asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Chris answered, monitoring the cleanup.</p><p>Etienne looked to Seth.</p><p>Seth nodded.</p><p>Richart touched Etienne\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Krysta listened with amazement as Jenna described her recent courtship with Richart, which had been a bizarre combination of conventional and unconventional.</p><p>The tale helped calm Krysta\u2019s nerves. As well as her fears. Jenna seemed so human. So normal. She\u2019d been a single mom, struggling to put a son she\u2019d had way too young through college, when she had met Richart. Her concerns seemed so not paranormal. And her love for Richart so sweet. Still fresh and new.</p><p>Krysta actually found herself envying the woman.</p><p>Very unsettling.</p><p>Richart and Etienne suddenly appeared a few feet away.</p><p>Heart slamming against her ribs\u2014and not just because it startled her\u2014Krysta leapt to her feet.</p><p>Jenna did, too. Hurrying over to her husband, she hugged him hard despite the blood that stained him. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, sweetheart. I just need some blood.\u201d</p><p>Krysta had the odd impulse to do the same to Etienne, to run to him and hug him tight and tell him how glad she was to see he was okay. Or mostly okay. She couldn\u2019t tell if any of the blood staining his weird suit was his.</p><p>She settled for crossing to stand in front of him. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Two more men suddenly materialized before the brothers. Krysta noticed absently that Sheldon looked as though he had been wallowing in mud. The other man . . .</p><p>She gawked. Damn. He was hot. As hot as Etienne and Richart, but several inches taller with wavy, black hair that fell past his waist. He positively oozed power. And his aura . . .</p><p>She had never seen anything like it. It was an almost blindingly bright white with none of the swirling purple that flowed through Etienne, Richart, and Jenna\u2019s auras.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Sheldon said.</p><p>The man nodded and disappeared.</p><p>Krysta returned her gaze to Etienne, whose face had darkened with a scowl. \u201cWho was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth, the leader of the Immortal Guardians. The eldest and most powerful among us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, he\u2019s our leader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean, he isn\u2019t a vampire or an immortal. So what is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an immortal.\u201d</p><p>Krysta eyed Etienne\u2019s aura. \u201cHe is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ll explain everything when we get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNnnnnno. Your home is . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShot to shit,\u201d Sheldon supplied for him.</p><p>Richart popped the young man on the back of the head.</p><p>\u201cDude, I\u2019m wearing a helmet. I didn\u2019t even\u2014\u201d</p><p>Richart popped him on the head again with enough force to send him stumbling several steps away.</p><p>\u201cOkay. That I felt.\u201d</p><p>Etienne consulted his brother. \u201cCan you take us both at once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get some blood first.\u201d</p><p>Richart headed into the kitchen, Jenna at his side, clinging to his hand and leaning into him.</p><p>Sheldon gave Krysta a sheepish look. \u201cSorry about your house.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, not knowing what else to do.</p><p>Sheldon unfastened the chin strap of his helmet and tugged it off. \u201cSee you guys at the meeting tonight. I\u2019m gonna go take a shower.\u201d Spinning on his heels, he trudged down the hallway and out of sight.</p><p>\u201cWhat meeting?\u201d Krysta asked.</p><p>\u201cSeth has called a meeting to discuss what has happened and how to identify and deal with the new threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go home, can I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I guess I could stay in a hotel.\u201d It would have to be the cheapest one she could find.</p><p>\u201cYou can stay with me,\u201d Etienne suggested. \u201cYou\u2019ll be accompanying me to the meeting tonight anyway.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. \u201cI will?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m afraid so. Seth has asked that you be there. And no one gainsays Seth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs he that much more powerful than the rest of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019m a babe compared to him.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he was a babe. A total babe. But not the way he meant it.</p> <p>He grinned.</p><p>Krysta frowned. \u201cDamn it! Stop reading my thoughts!\u201d</p><p>Etienne shrugged. \u201cI was just peeking to see how you were taking all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot well,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cWould you take it better if I told you I think you\u2019re a total babe, too?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA little bit.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and, wrapping an arm around her, drew her close for a hug.</p><p>Krysta looped her arms around his waist, surprised by how natural it felt despite the rubber suit.</p><p>\u201cEvery day you amaze me more,\u201d he murmured. And she could have sworn he brushed a kiss across the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cEvery day you confuse me more,\u201d she countered.</p><p>\u201cIt will all become clear soon.\u201d</p> <p>His earlier words squeezed past the confusion and concern for her brother, as well as the worry over where the hell they were going to live and how they would pay for everything. \u201cWait. Who is going to be at this meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost likely all of the Immortal Guardians in the area, as well as their Seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a Second again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe human guard or assistant of an immortal. We all have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a Renfield?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how many Immortal Guardians are we talking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFourteen or fifteen.\u201d</p> <p>Krysta inadvertently tightened her grip on him as fear returned.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t hurt you, Krysta. I know it seems like we\u2019ve been doing a piss-poor job of it, but we\u2019re here to help you and protect you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She supposed she would just have to trust them. Go with gut instinct. Blind hope. Because what other choice did she have?</p><p>Richart and Jenna returned.</p><p>Rather than leap away from her as Krysta expected, Etienne kept one arm around her and shifted her to his side. As if they were a couple.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Richart asked. \u201cI\u2019d like to go and get back so I can rest for a few hours before the meeting.\u201d</p><p>Etienne nodded. \u201cSee that he does rest,\u201d he implored Jenna. \u201cHe was tranqed earlier.\u201d</p><p>Jenna frowned up at her husband. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to worry you. Besides, Chris gave me the antidote.\u201d</p><p>She nodded at Etienne. \u201cHe\u2019ll rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Richart stepped away from his wife and touched Etienne\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Blackness engulfed them. A second later, the room brightened. Only it was a different room.</p><p>Krysta glanced around.</p><p>In a different house.</p><p>\u201cSee you at the meeting tonight,\u201d Richart said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious about you getting some rest,\u201d Etienne said.</p><p>Richart\u2019s lips quirked. \u201cAs soon as I finish what you so rudely interrupted earlier.\u201d</p><p>An instant later he vanished.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Krysta said. \u201cAfter being shot and hunting whoever the hell that was at my house and being tranqed, he\u2019s going to go home and make love to his wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re newlyweds,\u201d Etienne said with a shrug. \u201cThat\u2019s actually why I wanted to spend the day here instead of there. Their relationship is still new enough that they haven\u2019t had a chance to soundproof the walls of their bedroom, so spending the day there can be awkward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would think so. With your ears, you can probably hear everything.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. He and Lisette had learned very quickly that, although they were always welcome at Richart\u2019s home (the three of them had always been close and routinely slept at each others\u2019 houses to stave off loneliness), Richart wasn\u2019t going to let their presence dampen his amorous pursuits of his wife.</p><p>Actually, Richart was so besotted that Etienne wasn\u2019t sure it had even occurred to him that his brother and sister could hear him making love with Jenna. This situation was new to them. Lisette was the only one of them who had ever been married, and that had been before her transformation.</p><p>Cam entered, his hair mussed from sleep. He wore his usual sleeping garb: a T-shirt and sweatpants. When he had first been named Etienne\u2019s Second, he had slept in the buff, which Etienne had nixed when he had arrived home one night battered enough to require immediate aid. Then had come boxers, which had been replaced by the sweats and a T-shirt after Lisette and Richart had made several surprise visits.</p><p>The pants were for Lisette\u2019s benefit. Cam couldn\u2019t care less about either of the men catching him in his drawers.</p><p>\u201cCame home after all?\u201d Cam said, eyeing Krysta curiously.</p><p>\u201cYes. Cam, this is Krysta. She saved my life tonight and lost her home as a result. Krysta, this is Cameron, my Second.\u201d</p><p>Cam strode forward and offered his hand. \u201cGood to meet you. Sorry about your house.\u201d</p><p>Krysta shook his hand. \u201cThanks. Etienne seems to think it would be best if I bunk here for the day. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you\u2019re on our side, you\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is,\u201d Etienne stated.</p><p>Cam nodded. \u201cFirst things first. Are you wounded?\u201d he asked Etienne.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get you some blood.\u201d He left, then returned with two bags of blood Etienne swiftly drew into his parched veins. \u201cThe men you fought were mercenaries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Cam slid a glance Krysta\u2019s way. \u201cYou\u2019re sure she isn\u2019t one of them?\u201d</p><p>Krysta answered before Etienne could. \u201cWould they have tried to kill me if I were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The mercenaries we fought in the past considered each other expendable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam,\u201d Etienne warned, \u201cdon\u2019t press her. She isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve read her thoughts?\u201d</p><p>Etienne shifted. \u201cSome of them. I can\u2019t read her at will the way I can you and most other mortals.\u201d</p><p>Cam stared at Krysta. \u201cDamn. Lucky you.\u201d</p><p>Much to Etienne\u2019s relief, Krysta sent his protective Second a wry smile. \u201cNot when the thoughts he can read are the inappropriate ones.\u201d</p><p>Cam laughed. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re the reason he\u2019s been so distracted these last few weeks.\u201d</p><p>Krysta smiled as she met Etienne\u2019s gaze.</p><p>He sighed. Was everyone he knew going to say that when they met her? \u201cThis is getting embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou could have told me it was a woman,\u201d Cam continued. \u201cI\u2019ve given you an earful about Laura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we really have to talk about this now? In front of Krysta?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m pissed about you keeping me out of the fight. And, instead of pouting, I\u2019ve decided to irritate you.\u201d</p><p>Etienne shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve been spending too much time with Sheldon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot by choice. Do you two want something to eat before you turn in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Krysta said.</p><p>Etienne agreed. \u201cSeth has called for a meeting at David\u2019s tonight, an hour after sunset. I want to get some rest before I face the inquisition.\u201d</p><p>Cam nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll keep a sharp eye out in case any of the mercenaries show up on our doorstep.\u201d</p><p>Krysta raised her eyebrows. \u201cI don\u2019t see how they could. Richart teleported us.\u201d Her face scrunched up. \u201cIt feels so weird to say that.\u201d</p><p>Cam laughed. \u201cLike in a B-movie, right?\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cYes. But he did. So I don\u2019t see how anyone could track us here.\u201d</p><p>Cam held up a finger. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d</p><p>Etienne watched him head up the hallway to the room they affectionately called the armory.</p><p>A moment later he returned, carrying a handheld metal detector. \u201cDisarm.\u201d</p><p>Etienne removed his weapons one by one and set them on the scarred coffee table nearby. That\u2019s new, he spoke in Cam\u2019s mind. A metal detector?</p><p>Yes. Chris sent it over when we were dealing with Emrys.</p><p>Krysta examined the blades piling up on the table.</p><p>Cam crossed to stand in front of Etienne. \u201cNow. Let\u2019s see if you\u2019ve got any shrapnel I need to dig out.\u201d</p><p>Shrapnel, my ass, Etienne drawled.</p><p>If you\u2019ve got shrapnel in your ass, it\u2019s going to stay there, Cam responded with twitching lips. I\u2019m looking for tracking devices the mercenaries may have tagged you with and didn\u2019t want your girlfriend to know.</p><p>She isn\u2019t my girlfriend.</p><p>Yet.</p><p>\u201cIs that a metal detector?\u201d she asked, abandoning the weapons to watch Cam and Etienne.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cam said, sweeping it up and down Etienne\u2019s limbs. \u201cUsually, the bullets will be pushed out during the healing process, but little pieces that break off can take longer. He\u2019ll heal faster if I dig them out.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed with concern. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>You could have told her the truth, Etienne said, uncomfortable with the lie.</p><p>No, I couldn\u2019t. Not until we\u2019re one hundred percent sure she\u2019s on our side. I assumed you wouldn\u2019t want to lie to her yourself, so I did it for you.</p><p>Thank you, Etienne said grudgingly.</p><p>Cam shook his head. You really have it bad for her, don\u2019t you?</p><p>Yes, damn it. But keep that to yourself.</p><p>Will do. \u201cAll clear,\u201d Cam announced.</p><p>Krysta sighed with relief.</p><p>\u201cCan I do anything for the two of you before you turn in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Krysta said again.</p><p>\u201cReordon is going to have some men escort Krysta\u2019s brother Sean here when he gets off work,\u201d Etienne informed him. \u201cThey\u2019re well trained and shouldn\u2019t be followed, but that\u2019s when it will happen if it does.\u201d</p><p>Cam nodded. \u201cIs the brother on our side?\u201d</p><p>Etienne glanced at Krysta. \u201cThat\u2019s yet to be decided.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe will be,\u201d Krysta said, uncertainty in her voice. \u201cOnce he understands that Etienne isn\u2019t a vampire, I\u2019m sure Sean will come around.\u201d</p><p>Cam frowned. \u201cHe thinks you\u2019re a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen why is he being brought here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be with Krysta. He\u2019ll be won over faster if he sees firsthand that I\u2019ve no wish to harm her. Don\u2019t worry, though. Chris is sending a contingent of guards to watch the house and grounds. Seth\u2019s orders.\u201d</p><p>The rumble of approaching vehicles swelled outside, accompanied by the muffled conversations of network guards.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s them now.\u201d</p><p>Cam nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of everything. You say the meeting is scheduled for an hour after sunset?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ready. You two see if you can\u2019t get some sleep.\u201d Cam placed the metal detector on the coffee table beside Etienne\u2019s weapons and strode over to the front door. Opening it, he called a greeting and stepped outside to deal with their new security detail.</p><p>Silence fell. Krysta stared up at Etienne.</p><p>Awkward.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing it again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou projected that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how that works and am too tired to try to figure it out.\u201d Fatigue clawed at her, leaving her weary enough not to put up any more of a fight if he read her thoughts.</p><p>Etienne closed the distance between them. \u201cLet\u2019s try to get some sleep.\u201d Resting a hand on her lower back, he guided her into a hallway. \u201cYou can have my sister Lisette\u2019s room. I never know when she\u2019ll drop in, so I always keep it ready for her.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, full of ambivalence.</p><p>On the one hand, she was relieved that he hadn\u2019t asked her to sleep with him. She may have known him, in a manner of speaking, for a couple of weeks, but she didn\u2019t know him. Not really.</p><p>Nor did she fully trust him yet.</p><p>On the other hand, it had been nice, falling asleep beside him earlier. And this had been a hell of a day. Or night. Or whatever. Not only had her beliefs concerning the paranormal world and its inhabitants been rocked off of its foundations, she had killed two men. And she had nearly been killed herself by a whole host of others. Men not vampires.</p><p>And she had lost everything. From the sounds of things, the little house she and Sean rented had been completely trashed. The contents destroyed along with it. How were they going to bounce back from this? They lived paycheck to paycheck.</p> <p>And what would happen to her when she went before all those immortals at the big meeting ahead of them? What would they do to her?</p><p>Etienne paused before an open door that led down into a basement. \u201cAfter you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is so surreal,\u201d she muttered as she tromped down the stairs.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t what she expected. She had thought it would be cold and dark and damp. Instead, the basement looked remarkably like the first floor, just without windows.</p><p>Again, Etienne placed a hand at her back and guided her to the first door on the right. \u201cYou and Lisette are of a similar size, so please feel free to delve into her closet and borrow whatever you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d When he reached in and turned on the light, she studied the room.</p><p>It was pretty. Expensive hotel room pretty. She would have thought anyone two hundred years old would furnish their home with big, bulky antiques. But this room, and the rest of the house, was quite modern. Clean. Almost minimalist, with none of the froufrou stuff that professionally designed rooms featured in magazines all seemed to boast.</p><p>\u201cIs it to your liking?\u201d Etienne asked, brow furrowed. He actually seemed worried that it may not appeal to her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the nicest place I\u2019ve ever stayed,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll be comfortable. I\u2019ll be across the hall if you should need anything.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, suddenly feeling lost. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Etienne took her hand and drew her into a hug, one she very much needed in that moment. \u201cDon\u2019t lie awake all day, trying to figure everything out. There will be time enough for that tonight.\u201d</p><p>Easier said than done, but she\u2019d try.</p><p>He drew back. Reaching up, he curled his hand into a loose fist and stroked her face with the backs of his fingers.</p><p>\u201cAre you messing with my head, Etienne?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t brainwashing me and tricking me into believing you\u2019re a good guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not powerful enough to brainwash you. I can search others\u2019 thoughts. I can catch yours every once in awhile. But I can\u2019t alter them. The elders can, but not I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do I feel like I\u2019ve known you for a lot longer than I have?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. But I feel the same way.\u201d Lowering his head, he touched his lips to hers.</p><p>Her heartbeat picked up, surely drawing his notice. It really sucked that he knew how much he affected her while she was left in the dark.</p><p>He captured one of her hands and pressed it to his chest.</p><p>Beneath the rubber and all of that hard muscle, his heart raced as swiftly as her own.</p><p>When he raised his head, his brown eyes bore a faint amber glow. \u201cThis has all been as much of a surprise to me as it has been to you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, incapable of doing anything else.</p><p>\u201cNo one has ever tempted me more.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed.</p><p>\u201cRight across the hall,\u201d he murmured, backing away from her.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d she said, surprised she could sound so normal when such upheaval teemed within her. \u201cOr rather day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep well.\u201d</p><p>Passing through the darkened doorway across the hall, he flicked on the light and closed the door.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Though he needed a good healing sleep, Etienne found rest elusive.</p><p>Chris hadn\u2019t skimped on the security detail. A dozen men stood sentry along the house\u2019s exterior. Three dozen more patrolled the grounds and manned the perimeter.</p><p>Etienne had made sure his home rested on enough private land that he wouldn\u2019t be able to hear his neighbors\u2019 thoughts and they wouldn\u2019t be able to see him return home covered with bloodstains, so it was a rather large perimeter.</p><p>All the guards were very focused and spoke little, but Etienne\u2019s sharp ears still picked up their movements, murmured comments, and periodic radio checks.</p><p>And then there was Krysta.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t lied when he had told her no one had ever tempted him more.</p><p>He had once told Sarah that he loved strong women.</p><p>Krysta was very strong.</p><p>Krysta was amazing. Krysta hunted vampires and had killed two men to protect him.</p><p>Krysta set his body on fire.</p><p>It had been hard as hell to back away from her and leave her to seek sleep in Lisette\u2019s room. But she didn\u2019t trust him fully. Asking him if he had brainwashed her had been ample proof of that. And she had been through hell during the past twenty-four hours.</p><p>Etienne regretted that the mercenaries, whoever the hell they were, had destroyed her home, and fully intended to make them pay. But he was very happy to have her here in his home and to have this chance to win her trust.</p><p>Was this how Richart had felt about Jenna? Why he had pursued her even when he thought a happy ending impossible for the two of them?</p><p>The door across the hallway opened.</p><p>Etienne\u2019s heart ceased beating for several long moments, then began to slam against his ribs.</p><p>Was Krysta coming to him?</p><p>He\u2019d be lying if he said he hadn\u2019t hoped she would.</p><p>Alas, no. Nearly silent footsteps took her down the hallway and up the stairs.</p><p>Tossing back the covers, he rose and donned the sweatpants he\u2019d laid out in case Krysta needed him for anything. (Somehow he didn\u2019t think creeping up behind her naked would send the right message.) Then he opened his door and went in search of her.</p><p>He found her in the living room.</p><p>Why was it, he wondered as he paused in the doorway to admire her, that pajamas made men look geeky, yet made women look incredibly alluring?</p><p>The pajamas Krysta wore were made of some silky burgundy material. Having been raised in far different times, Lisette sometimes complained about constantly having to dress like a man. To compensate, she wore feminine things like this when she wasn\u2019t hunting.</p><p>Her back to him, Krysta leaned forward over a chair to peer through the window, out into bright sunlight.</p><p>Etienne, too, had been born in a different time. He wasn\u2019t like men today. He didn\u2019t need to see a woman\u2019s breasts shoved up to her neck in a push-up bra and spilling out of her blouse to take notice. He didn\u2019t need skirts so short the women who wore them couldn\u2019t bend over without showing their underwear or exposing their vaginas. He didn\u2019t need pants cut so low that thongs and butt cracks peeked out at him.</p><p>If it was out there, it was out there. No surprises. No anticipation. No fun.</p><p>Etienne was more titillated by what he couldn\u2019t see. He liked being kept guessing. He liked imagining what that silky material might conceal, how it would feel to peel each layer back and reveal what no one else could see. What no one else had even glimpsed.</p><p>The pajama pants covered Krysta from hips to ankles. Her feet, smaller than he had imagined, were bare. The long sleeves of the top had been rolled back almost to her elbows. Her hair was loose and rumpled.</p><p>Utterly delicious.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Gasping, she spun around. \u201cYou startled me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me. I didn\u2019t intend to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just looking at the guards. They seem very formidable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey take their job very seriously and will give their lives to protect us, should such become necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re that devoted to you?\u201d</p><p>He strolled into the room, uncomfortable with the question. It made the guards seem subservient. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it that way. It\u2019s more that we\u2019re brothers in arms. Soldiers all fighting a common enemy. It bonds us, even if we don\u2019t know each other.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She glanced back at the window. \u201cYou don\u2019t know those guys?\u201d</p><p>He stopped beside her and, avoiding the golden rays of sunshine that poured through the filmy curtains, peered outside.</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d she said, touching his arm and nudging him farther away from the light.</p> <p>He smiled, warmed by her concern. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I won\u2019t burst into flames. I\u2019ll just sunburn in record time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill sunlight kill vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Vampires can\u2019t tolerate any level of sunlight. Immortals have greater tolerance to it because of our advanced DNA, but younger ones like me are still vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>He studied the faces of as many guards as he could see from this perspective. \u201cI believe I\u2019ve seen one or two of these men before, but have never spoken with them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd yet they would die for you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a one-way street. They know we risk our lives every night, hunting and destroying vampires who would prey upon them. There was a night not long ago when Richart, Lisette, and I, along with the other immortals you will meet later, risked our lives battling not vampires, but humans who would have killed or tortured every man you see out there.\u201d He drew back from the window. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you sleep?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI always have trouble sleeping in a new place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the past few hours have been difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. So much has happened.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m still having trouble processing it all. My mind is racing. And I keep obsessing over the stupidest things. Like how Sean and I are going to explain the crater in the living room floor and the bullet holes Sheldon said riddled every wall to our landlord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. We\u2019ll take care of it. We\u2019re very good at cleaning up our messes.\u201d He touched her shoulder, the silky material cool beneath his fingers, and guided her toward the sofa. \u201cWhat you need right now is something that will take your mind off of everything so you can relax.\u201d She sat down at his urging, the V-neck of her shirt giving him the briefest glimpse of shadowy cleavage. \u201cAnd what I need is something to take my mind off of you in those pajamas.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled and fingered the neckline. \u201cThey really aren\u2019t my style. I\u2019m more of a sleep-shirt kind of girl.\u201d</p><p>He groaned and sank onto his haunches to examine the DVDs lining the shelves beneath the large flat-screen TV. \u201cDon\u2019t put that image in my head.\u201d</p><p>Krysta stared at his broad, muscled back and narrow waist, bare and totally drool-worthy, as was his chest when he faced her. \u201cTit for tat. I lost my ability to concentrate as soon as I turned and saw you wearing nothing but those sweatpants.\u201d</p><p>Surely, he had heard her heart\u2019s crazy antics.</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>She liked his laugh. Smooth and deep.</p><p>He chose a DVD and slipped it into the player. Rising, he grabbed the remote and joined her on the sofa.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t leave any space between them. His hip pressed against hers as he draped his arm across the back cushion. \u201cI keep telling myself to keep my distance, but . . .\u201d</p> <p>She nodded, leaning into his side. \u201cI\u2019m too tired to worry about it right now.\u201d She smiled at the television. Monk?</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s smart. It\u2019s funny. And it advocates true love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tragic love, though. His wife is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t most love affairs end tragically?\u201d he asked, frowning at the screen.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Your brother seems pretty happy.\u201d</p><p>His face lightened. \u201cYes, he does. I didn\u2019t see that coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you tell me you\u2019re psychic, too\u2014\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Still smiling, he glanced down at her. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you coming either.\u201d</p><p>Manic butterflies invaded her stomach as she licked lips suddenly gone dry.</p><p>The amber glow returned to his eyes as he followed the motion with his gaze.</p><p>The TV brightened with the menu for Monk.</p><p>He looked toward it.</p><p>Krysta sighed. She had been sure he was going to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cI thought I would be pushing my luck if I did,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She didn\u2019t even care that he was reading her thoughts again.</p><p>\u201cI also thought you might need a little distance.\u201d</p><p>She fought the urge to laugh. Their sides were glued together and his arm now rested across her shoulders, his fingers toying with her hair.</p><p>His lips twitched as he glanced at her from the corner of his eye. \u201cNote I said I thought you needed some distance. Tonight I find myself needing the opposite, so this was my compromise.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>The show began.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say why you were up,\u201d she mentioned. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Too many bodies nearby, moving and murmuring. I\u2019m used to it only being Cam and I and sometimes my siblings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d he continued, \u201cI found myself obsessing over a thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat thought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, had I not arrived when I did last night, you likely would have died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt Duke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t refute it. He was right. Even had the mercenaries not shown up with guns blazing, she couldn\u2019t have defeated that many vampires on her own.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t it bother you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThat I could have died?\u201d she countered. \u201cOf course. A lot. But I know every time I go out hunting that my death is a possible outcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why the hell do you do it?\u201d</p><p>She thought a moment. \u201cBecause it needs to be done. Because it\u2019s worth the risk. Because I promised myself a long time ago that I would kill every vampire on the planet or die trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing, just returned his gaze to the screen.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to call me a fool or demand I stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t a fool. I understand a need for vengeance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the other?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI believe I already tried to convince you to stop hunting. I don\u2019t have the energy tonight to bang my head against a brick wall.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cTo be continued, then?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cTo be continued.\u201d</p><p>She tore her gaze away from his handsome profile and stared at the screen. \u201cHave you seen this episode?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my favorites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw it once a few years ago, but can\u2019t remember how the husband did it. Don\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>He curled his hand over her shoulder and drew her a little closer. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Resting her head in the crook of his shoulder, she drew her legs up onto the sofa and relaxed against him.</p><p>Etienne heard the front door open and close and didn\u2019t bother to open his eyes. Cam had been coming and going throughout the afternoon, as quietly as a mortal could, so as not to disturb the duo slumbering on the sofa.</p><p>Krysta would have to watch the Monk episode they had begun another time. She had fallen asleep only fifteen minutes into it.</p><p>Unwinding at last himself, Etienne had lain back on the sofa, drawn his legs up, and managed to spoon his body around her without landing them both on the floor.</p><p>Damn, it felt good. Even better than holding her hand had as they had slept beside each other at her house.</p><p>He had really needed this. The more he thought about what had happened at Duke, the more panicked he felt. That many vampires would have defeated her and ended her reign as North Carolina\u2019s\u2014if not the world\u2019s\u2014most successful mortal vampire hunter. And, if by some miracle they hadn\u2019t, the mercenaries who had come later would have likely thought her an immortal and tranqed her with a dose that would\u2019ve been lethal to her.</p><p>Either way, she would have died.</p><p>Tightening his hold, he buried his face in her hair and breathed in her scent.</p><p>Something sharp pricked his neck just beneath his chin.</p><p>He stilled, opened his eyes.</p><p>Sean stood over them, his face set in stone, with one of Etienne\u2019s own daggers in his hand, angled to slit Etienne\u2019s throat.</p><p>Easy, Etienne spoke into his mind.</p><p>Sean\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m telepathic. Speak softly so you won\u2019t wake her. She had difficulty falling asleep.</p><p>\u201cAnd you thought feeling her up would help?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. If we\u2019re going to do the keep-your-hands-off-my-sister thing, let me put her to bed first. Her bed, he stressed before Sean could suggest otherwise.</p><p>Sean withdrew the blade.</p><p>In one fluid motion, Etienne rose with Krysta in his arms. She stirred, but didn\u2019t awaken.</p><p>Sean frowned. \u201cWhat did you do to her? She\u2019s usually a light sleeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. She\u2019s just exhausted. Too little sleep and too many adrenaline rushes.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Sean followed him down to Lisette\u2019s room, where Etienne laid Krysta on the bed and drew the covers up to her chin.</p><p>He turned to her brother and abandoned all hopes of getting any sleep today. \u201cLet\u2019s return to the living room, and I\u2019ll bring you up to speed.\u201d</p><p>Krysta was a nervous wreck on the ride to the meeting.</p><p>Cam drove while Sean sat in the passenger seat, scowling out the window.</p><p>Her brother wasn\u2019t taking this very well. He was worried about her, afraid Etienne was screwing with her head (even more so now that he knew Etienne was a telepath), afraid the whole immortal versus vampire thing was bullshit, even though the concept of both being caused by a virus intrigued the medicine lover in him.</p><p>Krysta didn\u2019t blame him. He had only had twenty-four hours to try to figure this out while she had known, or suspected, for two weeks now that Etienne was different.</p><p>And there was also the whole attraction thing that softened her toward Etienne. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Or blinded her to the truth, as Sean feared.</p><p>But Krysta didn\u2019t think so. Vampires were insane. They were mentally off, and anyone who spent two minutes in their company knew it. Not once, all day, had any of the immortals she had met done anything to suggest they weren\u2019t completely lucid. Not once had she felt threatened by them.</p><p>Nervous? Yes. Confused? Yes. In danger of being harmed by them? No.</p> <p>\u201cWho is David?\u201d she asked as dark arboreal shadows in monstrous proportions whizzed past outside the window. The meeting to which they had all been summoned would be held at the home of someone named David, who seemed to live way out in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>Seated beside her, Etienne said, \u201cDavid is the second eldest, most powerful immortal in existence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly and suspect he ceased counting centuries ago. Suffice it to say, he is old enough to have witnessed biblical events.\u201d</p><p>Her neck popped as her head snapped in his direction. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>Sean turned to look at them over his shoulder. \u201cAre you saying he\u2019s thousands of years old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo vampires live that long?\u201d Sean asked, mimicking her own thoughts.</p><p>\u201cNo. Vampires rarely live a century because of the madness that claims them. Either they kill each other in fits of rage, are hunted and killed by immortals, or grow careless and inadvertently bring about their own destruction.\u201d</p><p>Krysta couldn\u2019t even imagine living that long. She had suspected vampires didn\u2019t live as long as movies and books often claimed they did. But immortals . . .</p><p>Living thousands of years? What was that like?</p> <p>\u201cYou said second eldest,\u201d she murmured. \u201cIs the tall one I met earlier older?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And he\u2019s only about an inch taller than David.\u201d</p><p>Sean frowned at her. \u201cYou met another one?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHe must have been six foot seven or eight, and he positively oozed power.\u201d</p><p>Sean shifted his gaze to Etienne. \u201cJust what are these elders\u2019 gifts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t answer that,\u201d Cam said, catching Etienne\u2019s gaze in the rearview mirror.</p><p>Krysta waited for Etienne to respond.</p><p>He remained silent, disappointing her, but she couldn\u2019t fault him for it. Sean wasn\u2019t exactly cooperating. Or he was, but had put up quite the verbal fight in an attempt to avoid this meeting. The idea of being sequestered in a home with over a dozen immortals was very unnerving.</p> <p>So Krysta could see why Etienne might be reluctant to share more secrets without first securing Sean\u2019s favor.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d Cam announced, turning onto a secluded drive and following it to a tall security gate. Heavy silence filled the car as he rolled down his window, reached out, and entered a security code she couldn\u2019t see from her vantage point.</p><p>The majestic gates swung open on well-oiled hinges.</p><p>Dark trees towered over them, blocking out the moon, as the car crawled forward along a winding road that ended in a circular drive full of . . . hybrids and electric cars?</p><p>Sean peered through the window as Cam parked behind a shiny black Prius. \u201cAre you guys, like, environmentalists or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of our senses are heightened,\u201d Etienne said, \u201cnot just our vision. Our sense of smell is more acute than a polar bear\u2019s or an arctic fox\u2019s. The pollution you barely notice that makes the air smell a little stale to you makes it smell to us as though we\u2019re living downwind of a garbage dump on a hot summer\u2019s day.\u201d</p><p>Krysta grimaced. \u201cThat sucks.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cParticularly since most of us have lived long enough to remember what the world smelled like before the industrial revolution.\u201d</p><p>Cam exited the car and pocketed the keys.</p><p>Etienne opened his door, stepped out, and circled around to open Krysta\u2019s before she could reach for the handle.</p><p>She took the hand he gallantly offered and let him help her from the car.</p><p>Did she need the help?</p><p>Of course not.</p><p>Did she leap at the excuse to touch him?</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>Sean joined them and slammed his door shut out of habit.</p><p>Etienne motioned toward the house. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>The door swung open at their approach.</p><p>Etienne nodded to Darnell, who greeted them all with a smile.</p><p>\u201cHi. You must be Krysta and Sean. It\u2019s nice to meet you. I\u2019m Darnell, David\u2019s Second.\u201d</p><p>Krysta and Sean each shook his hand.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re human?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m a gifted one like you two.\u201d</p><p>That was news to Etienne. He had thought Darnell human.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to ask you to let me hold on to your cell phones while you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Is that really necessary? Etienne asked him.</p><p>Darnell met Etienne\u2019s gaze. Yes. We can\u2019t risk them recording anything they see or hear. Chris also wants me to go over them with a metal detector.</p><p>Hell. Isn\u2019t the fact that the mercenaries didn\u2019t attack us at my place or at Sean\u2019s job proof enough that they aren\u2019t being tracked?</p><p>Not in Chris\u2019s mind.</p><p>Paranoid bastard.</p><p>That paranoid bastard brought you reinforcements today.</p><p>I know, damn it. I\u2019m just tired.</p><p>Darnell\u2019s lips twitched as he stepped outside with them and held out his hand.</p><p>Krysta and Sean dropped their phones into it, their irritation obvious.</p><p>Darnell checked the phones to ensure they were turned off, then pocketed them. \u201cI\u2019ll return them to you when you leave.\u201d He reached behind him and pulled a handheld metal detector from his back pocket.</p><p>Etienne sighed. \u201cI apologize for this.\u201d</p><p>Krysta did not look pleased. \u201cSo you expect me to trust you, even though you clearly don\u2019t trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust you,\u201d Etienne assured her. He really did.</p><p>\u201cIf Etienne weren\u2019t attracted to you, the rest of us would, too,\u201d Darnell said, earning Etienne\u2019s wrath. \u201cBut smitten immortals have trusted the wrong humans often enough in the past to make us wary under such circumstances.\u201d</p><p>A frown creasing her brow, she held out her arms. \u201cSmitten, huh?\u201d</p><p>Etienne didn\u2019t deny it.</p><p>Sean eyed the two with disapproval.</p><p>Darnell passed the wand over Krysta\u2019s head and chest, then down one arm. It beeped.</p><p>Pursing her lips, Krysta rolled back the sleeve of the black shirt she had borrowed from Lisette and revealed a small, sheathed dagger she had strapped to her wrist.</p><p>Darnell moved on to the other arm without removing the weapon. Another beep. A dagger graced her other wrist as well. Two more beeps revealed more tucked into the waist of her pants.</p><p>Etienne raised a brow.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she declared defensively, \u201cwhat did you expect? Total trust? I haven\u2019t known you for that long and am going on faith that you all are what you say you are and aren\u2019t vampires.\u201d</p><p>More beeps on her ankles. More weapons.</p><p>Darnell found the same on Sean. Etienne wasn\u2019t sure why that surprised him. Krysta had said Sean had skills and Etienne had witnessed as much in her dream.</p><p>Darnell pocketed the wand. \u201cOkay. We\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>Krysta stared at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Sean looked at Etienne, then Darnell. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to confiscate our weapons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d they said simultaneously.</p><p>Etienne wanted them to feel safe and knew the weapons would lend them a sense of security.</p><p>The siblings shared a glance.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Krysta asked.</p><p>Darnell shrugged. \u201cImmortals are stronger and faster than vampires. Your weapons are useless against the men and women here tonight.\u201d</p><p>And there went the sense of security.</p><p>Really? Etienne asked him. You couldn\u2019t have said you were letting them keep them as a gesture of faith or friendship?</p><p>No. I appreciated honesty when I stumbled into this world and assumed they would, too.</p><p>Etienne grunted, knowing he was right, but not wanting to admit it.</p><p>Krysta swallowed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t care that we\u2019re carrying weapons, what were you looking for with the metal detector?\u201d</p><p>She was sharp. Etienne loved that.</p><p>Darnell shrugged. \u201cMore cell phones. Voice or video recorders. Anything you might use to capture the meeting digitally.\u201d</p><p>And tracking devices. An overlooked tracking device had cost them lives in the past. They wouldn\u2019t make the same mistake again.</p><p>Darnell entered the house and gestured for them to follow. \u201cWelcome. And thank you for your cooperation.\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s home was large and spacious and tastefully decorated with modern furniture. Etienne had always felt at home here.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Krysta whispered to Sean. \u201cThis place is huge. Our whole house wouldn\u2019t even fill this living room.\u201d</p><p>David maintained an open-door policy, inviting all immortals, Seconds, and other members of the network to come and go as they pleased. Like Seth, he worked hard to create a family atmosphere. So his home saw a lot of traffic and needed to be big enough to handle it.</p><p>Several sofas graced the living room on the right, which bled into a dining room on the left. Etienne turned his attention there and saw that everyone else had already arrived. Everyone save Seth and David.</p><p>He guided Krysta toward a table that now seated twenty-eight. A leaf had been added to extend the table and accommodate the Immortal Guardians\u2019 growing numbers.</p><p>Conversation ceased as all eyes watched their approach.</p><p>The chairs at the head and foot of the table were vacant, reserved for the eldest immortals. At the far end, Ami sat beside her eight-century-old husband Marcus. Ami looked rather pallid tonight. She must have heard about the mercenary attack and, having been the primary target of the last one, was understandably distressed by the news that the threat had resumed.</p><p>Roland, the notoriously antisocial, nine-hundred-plus-year-old immortal, sat beside Marcus. The two Brits had known each other for eight centuries and were like brothers. Roland\u2019s wife Sarah, transformed only a couple of years earlier, occupied the seat beside him and leaned into his side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Next came Yuri and Stanislov and their Seconds. They were fairly new to the area, and Etienne hadn\u2019t had a chance to get to know them very well. Ethan, an American and formerly the youngest immortal in their midst at a hundred years, lounged beside the Russians. Then Edward, another Brit. Their Seconds.</p><p>A scowling Chris Reordon occupied the chair across from Ami. Beside him were Dr. Melanie Lipton, only recently transformed, and her husband Bastien, the black sheep of the immortal family who was still pretty widely hated. Next was Bastien\u2019s Second, Tanner. Sheldon, who actually seemed to like Bastien now. Richart. Jenna. Tracy, who was Lisette\u2019s Second. Lisette, who studied Krysta intently.</p><p>I like her, Lisette declared in his head.</p> <p>You don\u2019t even know her, he countered.</p><p>She\u2019s a mortal who strode into a house full of immortals with her head held high and her body loaded down with weapons. And she\u2019s smart enough to be attracted to you.</p><p>Can you read her mind? he asked curiously. He didn\u2019t like the idea of his sister intruding upon Krysta\u2019s thoughts, but wanted to see if he were the only one who couldn\u2019t (most of the time).</p><p>She frowned. No, I can\u2019t. Can you?</p><p>No. Not really. Not at will.</p> <p>A sly smile slid across her pretty features. Perfect.</p><p>He didn\u2019t dispute it. It was hard to pursue a relationship with someone when you could hear her every thought, including the ugly ones that slipped through when she was cranky or the occasional dark one that made even her think, Where the hell did that come from?</p><p>The soft sound of boots hitting bamboo drew his attention to the hallway that led from the living room to the back of the house and basement.</p><p>David entered, garbed in the black hunting clothes everyone else wore. His dreadlocks had been pulled back from his face and framed his hips as he strode toward them.</p><p>Etienne glanced at Krysta and saw her mouth fall open.</p><p>Wow.</p> <p>He frowned. That thought had come through loud and clear.</p><p>She gazed up at the elder immortal as though he were the most gorgeous thing she had ever beheld. He knew women found David\u2019s hair, height, muscles, and dark-as-midnight skin attractive, but Krysta looked as though she were about to begin drooling.</p><p>Don\u2019t get your shorts in a bunch, Lisette admonished. She isn\u2019t drooling. Your jealousy is making her response seem more than it is.</p><p>David stopped before them and smiled. \u201cKrysta, Sean, welcome to my home. I\u2019m David.\u201d Taking Krysta\u2019s hand, he raised it to his lips.</p><p>Etienne listened carefully to Krysta\u2019s heartbeat and relaxed a little when it didn\u2019t speed up at the attention.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Krysta offered.</p><p>He shook Sean\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re both safe and have decided to join us tonight. The events of the past twenty-four hours have caught us off guard. You, too, I understand. But we\u2019ll sort it all out together.\u201d</p><p>The sister and brother shared a look.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Krysta said.</p><p>David turned to Sean. \u201cNo, we aren\u2019t vampires. Etienne told you the truth. We\u2019re immortals and I\u2019m sure Dr. Lipton would be happy to discuss all of the medical intricacies of our differences with you.\u201d He looked at Krysta. \u201cYes, I\u2019m reading your thoughts. The safety of everyone under my roof is my responsibility and I wish to ensure you mean them no harm. And, no, Etienne was not lying when he said he couldn\u2019t read your mind. You have very strong natural defenses, but I\u2019m older and more powerful, so they proved minor obstacles for me.\u201d</p><p>Is she attracted to me? Etienne asked before he could stop himself. It was odd, not being able to freely access her thoughts and he was eager to confirm what the little glimpses he had managed thus far had told him.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d David answered aloud, \u201cshe\u2019s attracted to you.\u201d</p><p>Krysta frowned at Etienne and popped him on the arm. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>David turned to Sean. \u201cNo, Etienne isn\u2019t brainwashing her. And this isn\u2019t a total clusterfuck. Chris Reordon has already taken steps to purchase the home you rent so the two of you won\u2019t have to worry about the landlord giving you grief. Our cleanup crews are salvaging all of your possessions that they can and are packing them up for you so you can move into a new place\u2014a safe house of your choice\u2014once we\u2019ve squelched this latest threat. I know it will take some time to earn your trust, but whether you wish it to be true or not, you\u2019re one of us. We were all gifted ones like you before we were transformed. And we take care of our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re gifted ones?\u201d Lisette exclaimed with glee.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d David said, then addressed Krysta. \u201cAnd no, Etienne isn\u2019t messing with your head. You have totally captivated him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Sheldon said. \u201cThis is better than a soap opera. Maybe we should start an Immortal Guardians reality show and air it on theimmortalguardians.com.\u201d</p><p>David ignored him. \u201cWon\u2019t you please join us in the dining room?\u201d</p><p>Darnell and Cam had already seated themselves, Darnell taking the seat closest to this end and Cam the one next to him. Sean sat next to Cam. Etienne held the chair next to his for Krysta until she was seated, then claimed the one between her and Lisette.</p><p>David took the seat catty-corner to Darnell at this end of the table.</p><p>Darnell retrieved his cell phone and dialed. Etienne heard Seth answer.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll set.\u201d</p><p>Darnell ended the call and put away his phone.</p><p>Seth appeared at the opposite end of the table.</p><p>Sean and Krysta jumped, startled by his sudden appearance.</p><p>\u201cThank you all for coming. Krysta and Sean, we appreciate your joining us. I\u2019m Seth, the leader of the Immortal Guardians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d they murmured.</p><p>He took his seat. \u201cEtienne, would you formally introduce our guests?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Krysta listened carefully and tried to memorize every name and face as Etienne introduced her and Sean to the group. It was a relief to see other humans present. Or gifted ones. She wasn\u2019t sure how to tell those apart. But she could tell by their auras that there were almost as many mortals present as there were immortals.</p><p>Her gaze slid to Seth, whose aura glowed that brilliant white, then to David, whose aura did the same, but had a tiny sliver of purple mixed in. The other immortals had a pretty equal mix of white and purple.</p><p>She looked at the small redhead\u2014Ami?\u2014who sat beside Seth. Her aura was unlike anyone else\u2019s. It contained the same color variations of humans and gifted ones, but had little sparkly things in it, as if the stars in the night sky were peeking through a rainbow. It was beautiful and very peculiar. What was she?</p><p>Seth and David\u2019s auras were different because . . .</p><p>Actually, she wasn\u2019t sure. Was it because they were so old? Or were there other supernatural beings? Etienne seemed sure they were immortals, yet . . .</p><p>Those auras.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s begin,\u201d Seth said when the roll call of names ended.</p><p>Chris cleared his throat. \u201cBefore we get started, there\u2019s an issue we need to discuss.\u201d</p><p>Seth motioned for Chris to continue. \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind, Chris?\u201d</p><p>Chris\u2019s gaze circled the table. \u201cMy goal is the same as the network\u2019s: To protect you. It\u2019s why I scrutinize so carefully every member of the network before hiring him or her. It\u2019s why every Second is handpicked. If even one person leaks the truth to the media, in this information age in particular, it is hell to clean up and counter. Every year, with every new gadget and fucking cell phone with apps that can realign the damned planets, it gets harder. We can\u2019t afford to make a single mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>\u201cMy point is I can\u2019t protect you if you keep hiding your girlfriends from me.\u201d</p><p>Every eye swung toward Krysta.</p><p>She glanced around. \u201cWhy is everyone looking at me?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh, no. I\u2019m not Etienne\u2019s girlfriend. We just . . . hunt together . . . sort of. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re dating or . . . We haven\u2019t slept together or anything . . . I mean we slept together . . . twice, actually . . . but we didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t helping,\u201d Etienne murmured.</p><p>She clamped her lips shut. What a time to find out she babbled when she was nervous.</p><p>\u201cHe has a point,\u201d Roland spoke. \u201cEtienne hid this woman from us\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman has a name,\u201d Krysta interjected.</p><p>\u201c\u2014and Richart hid both Jenna and her son from us. Every mortal is a potential threat.\u201d</p><p>Chris frowned. \u201cSays the immortal who threatened to kill me if I went anywhere near Sarah when you two got together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve all said it a thousand times. I\u2019m an untrusting, antisocial bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t,\u201d Sarah protested and glared at the others. \u201cStop saying that.\u201d</p><p>Roland continued. \u201cAnyone who can win my trust deserves it. Besides, she saved my ass. Twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically,\u201d Krysta said, \u201cI saved Etienne\u2019s ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I risked it to save you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. I thanked you for that, right?\u201d</p><p>Chris waved his hands. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who saved whose ass. The point is every mortal poses a threat. Especially now. If you don\u2019t let me interro\u2014ah, interview these women, you place everyone in danger, because sooner or later someone always trusts the wrong person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Seth murmured.</p><p>\u201cAh hah!\u201d Richart blurted at the same time. \u201cYou were going to say interrogate! I knew it! That\u2019s why I kept Jenna a secret!\u201d</p><p>Chris swore beneath his breath as Roland and Etienne both nodded. \u201cOkay, maybe, in the past, I might have been a tad harsh when ensuring that an immortal\u2019s lover could be trusted. But can you blame me? Look what happened to Mattheus.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho the hell is Mattheus?\u201d Roland grumbled.</p><p>\u201cMattheus got screwed?\u201d Tracy said. \u201cThat sucks. He\u2019s so hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Mattheus?\u201d Sheldon seconded.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s an immortal from Brazil,\u201d Chris said. \u201cHis mortal lover, whom he thought was completely trustworthy, videotaped them having sex\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d Sheldon interjected with a grin.</p><p>Everyone looked at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I like porn.\u201d</p><p>Still they stared.</p> <p>He frowned. \u201cI have to give up booze, parties, and porn? Can\u2019t a Second have any vices?\u201d</p><p>Chris sighed. \u201cAnyway. She videotaped them having sex and intended to auction it off to news outlets once it had been authenticated by an expert who would swear the glowing eyes, fangs, and . . . ah . . . unusual speed and other things demonstrated were not special effects produced by a post-production house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they were,\u201d Sheldon suggested somberly. \u201cMaybe she was out to discredit him. I think we should all watch it and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tape has been destroyed,\u201d Seth cut in.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Sheldon slumped down in his seat.</p><p>Chris met Richart\u2019s gaze. \u201cAnytime you want me to get rid of him . . .\u201d</p> <p>Richart shook his head. \u201cHe amuses me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris does have a point,\u201d Seth said, returning to the subject at hand.</p><p>At the opposite end of the table, David nodded. \u201cWe have seen it countless times. This is a lonely existence that can sometimes drive us to trust where we should not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris,\u201d Seth continued, \u201cperhaps if you allowed the immortal to be present when you met with his lover, he would no longer feel wary of your possible treatment of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr him,\u201d Lisette tossed in.</p><p>Etienne raised his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I can\u2019t date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Chris said. \u201cIf any of you acquire a lover with whom you wish to share the truth, you can be present when I meet with her. But I do need to meet with her. Or him. If you\u2019d consent to a telepath being present or listening in from the next room, all the better.\u201d</p> <p>When no one spoke, Seth spoke for them. \u201cThey\u2019ll take it into consideration.\u201d The casual words carried the weight of an order. \u201cIs that all, Chris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now, yes.\u201d</p><p>Seth turned to Etienne. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>David leaned forward and braced his elbows on the table. \u201cTell us what happened last night.\u201d</p><p>Etienne hesitated. He wasn\u2019t sure how to tell them without explaining Krysta\u2019s role in it. And he thought it best to minimize that as much as possible.</p><p>No one seemed to have caught her reference to their hunting together. They had all been too titillated by the idea that he had been hiding away a girlfriend.</p><p>Which, as she had pointed out, was not to say that Krysta was his girlfriend.</p><p>You\u2019re rambling, David spoke in his head.</p><p>Etienne shot him a glance. Much to his surprise, the elder immortal seemed amused. No, I\u2019m not.</p><p>Yes, you are, Seth said.</p><p>Is everyone listening to my thoughts? he demanded with exasperation. His barriers were usually stronger than that.</p><p>No, just us, David answered.</p><p>Go ahead and tell them what happened, Seth advised. We\u2019ve already gleaned it.</p><p>Etienne leaned forward and braced his elbows on the table. \u201cI was out hunting with Krysta\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Chris interrupted. \u201cYou two really do hunt together?\u201d</p><p>Etienne looked at Krysta, who shrugged. \u201cIn a manner of speaking.\u201d</p><p>Chris threw up his hands. \u201cOkay. Another point of business. Most of the immortals at this table are at least a hundred years old, so I didn\u2019t think I had to remind any of you of this, but you cannot recruit your own Seconds. All Seconds must be assigned by the network, which thoroughly vets and trains them. What the hell, Etienne?\u201d</p><p>Now Krysta leaned forward. \u201cI\u2019m not a Second.\u201d</p><p>Before everyone could start bitching at once, Etienne held up a hand. \u201cKrysta came to my attention a couple of weeks ago. I was out hunting and saw several vampires tracking her with the clear intention of preying upon her. Much to my surprise, however, the vampires turned out to be the prey. Krysta is a vampire hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Sheldon blurted.</p><p>Etienne scowled at him. \u201cAs soon as I realized this, I began to follow her.\u201d As swiftly as possible, he caught them up on his adventures with Krysta.</p><p>\u201cNo wonder you\u2019ve been so distracted,\u201d Lisette said, studying Krysta curiously.</p><p>Marcus frowned. \u201cBy vampire hunter you mean . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hunts vampires. She lures them into traps, then dispatches them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>Krysta stiffened. \u201cThen I\u2019ve been doing the impossible for six years.\u201d</p><p>Disbelieving stares.</p><p>\u201cMortals can\u2019t defeat vampires in battle,\u201d Edward said.</p><p>\u201cThis one can,\u201d Krysta insisted.</p><p>\u201cAmi can,\u201d Sheldon pointed out.</p><p>\u201cMelanie could, when she was mortal,\u201d Bastien added with a proud smile.</p><p>\u201cBut Ami and Melanie didn\u2019t take them on alone,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cThey fought by Marcus\u2019s and Bastien\u2019s sides.\u201d</p><p>Marcus leaned forward and caught Ethan\u2019s eye. \u201cAmi wasn\u2019t fighting by my side when she kicked your ass in that sparring session. And you\u2019re faster than a vampire.\u201d</p><p>Sheldon laughed. \u201cBurn!\u201d</p><p>Seth sighed. \u201cWe\u2019re getting off topic here. I\u2019ve examined Krysta\u2019s thoughts. She has indeed been hunting vampires for the past six years with the help of her brother. And, before you ask, neither of them are members of the mercenary groups who keep troubling us. Her gift gives her an edge\u201d\u2014he held up a hand to stay him when Ethan opened his mouth again\u2014\u201cwhich I will not disclose. If Krysta wants you to know, she\u2019ll tell you herself.\u201d</p><p>Ethan stared at Krysta. A teasing gleam entered his eyes, making Etienne narrow his own as his hackles rose. Offering Krysta a flirtatious grin, Ethan said, \u201cI\u2019ll show you mine if you\u2019ll show me yours.\u201d</p><p>In a heartbeat, Etienne drew a dagger and threw it.</p><p>The hilt struck Ethan right in the center of his forehead, snapping his head back. \u201cOw! Shhhhit! What the hell, man?\u201d</p><p>Krysta gaped up at Etienne, who squirmed as everyone at the table stared at him.</p><p>He cleared his throat, but didn\u2019t know what to say. He hadn\u2019t really meant to do that. He had just reacted.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Sheldon said. \u201cHe has fallen and he has fallen hard.\u201d</p><p>Snickers and head shakes all around.</p><p>\u201cMerde.\u201d</p><p>David held up a hand and called for quiet. \u201cPlease continue, Etienne.\u201d</p><p>Eager to change the subject (Why did it seem to return so often to his being smitten with Krysta?), he told them about defeating the vampires, then being set upon by mercenaries.</p><p>No one reprimanded him for not getting the hell out of there as soon as he saw that first tranquilizer dart. That\u2019s what they were supposed to do to avoid capture, but all understood his desire to protect Krysta.</p><p>Cam leaned forward and braced his elbows on the table, his attention on Krysta and Sean. \u201cThank you. You don\u2019t know what they would have done to him if they had gotten their hands on him. If these are the same people we dealt with before\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how they can be,\u201d Melanie interrupted. \u201cThat threat was neutralized.\u201d</p><p>Etienne shook his head. \u201cThese soldiers were very reminiscent of the others.\u201d He related the events that followed at Krysta and Sean\u2019s home.</p><p>A steady stream of curses and exclamations of disbelief accompanied him.</p><p>Marcus looked ready to snap, his fury fairly heating the room. \u201cHow the hell is this possible?\u201d</p><p>Chris shook his head. \u201cIt must be a different group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have the fucking tranquilizer!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>Ami placed a hand on his arm.</p><p>Etienne understood Marcus\u2019s rage. The last mercenary group had included some of the monsters who had tortured Ami. And they had been eager as hell to get their hands on her again.</p><p>Cam shook his head. \u201cWe must have missed something.\u201d</p><p>Seth shook his head. \u201cWe didn\u2019t. Every mercenary who knew of our existence was either killed or had their memories wiped. And David and I saw to the latter ourselves.\u201d</p><p>David nodded. \u201cDarnell worked tirelessly with the network\u2019s techno-geeks to expunge all mention of us, of vampires, and of Ami from their computers and servers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd replaced it with malware,\u201d Darnell added. \u201cThere\u2019s no way they could recover those files. I couldn\u2019t even recover those files.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet,\u201d Roland said, \u201cEtienne was tranqed and attacked by humans garbed as soldiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould they be military?\u201d Sarah asked, brow furrowed. \u201cCould Emrys have gone to the military without our knowledge?\u201d</p><p>Seth shook his head. \u201cI would have seen it in his thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDonald and Nelson didn\u2019t either,\u201d David mentioned before anyone could ask.</p><p>Donald was the leader of the elite Private Military Company Emrys had drawn into his war with the immortals near the end. Nelson was Donald\u2019s second in command or yes-man. Because their company was widely known by the public, killing the two men would have raised too many questions, so their memories had been erased instead and a story concocted\u2014something about a couple of transport planes colliding in a freak accident\u2014to explain the deaths of the soldiers slain by the immortals.</p><p>\u201cSo where does that leave us?\u201d Cam asked.</p><p>Seth shook his head. \u201cWithout an explanation.\u201d</p><p>Krysta studied the men and women seated around the table in the grim hush that followed.</p><p>She glanced at Sean to see how he was taking all of this.</p><p>Suspicion had fled his face and been replaced by the same fascination she suspected lit her own. This was amazing. She didn\u2019t know what she had expected, but it hadn\u2019t been this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They were like a big family. They teased. They bantered. They got snippy with each other, like when Etienne had tossed his dagger at Ethan.</p><p>That had been too funny. And rather revealing. Etienne\u2019s eyes had actually glowed with jealousy. How cool was that?</p><p>Sean shifted slightly. \u201cHow did the mercenaries find out about you before?\u201d he asked, surprising her. She had sensed he was relaxing into the situation, but hadn\u2019t thought he had relaxed enough to participate in the conversation.</p> <p>David answered. \u201cThe brother of a vampire we slew told them, enlisting their aid in his quest for vengeance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould something similar have happened this time?\u201d</p><p>Seth shook his head. \u201cIt was the first time in history that such had occurred. Because of the madness that plagues them, vampires tend to either kill or transform relatives they bring into the loop. And most vampires think the only thing that differentiates us is immortals\u2019 unwillingness to kill innocents, or to let them do it. Because we don\u2019t fraternize, vampires often don\u2019t realize how much longer immortals live or know that we differ genetically. This human male was in a unique position to learn this information.\u201d</p><p>Everyone shifted their gaze to a man at the opposite end of the table who sat with his arm around a pretty brunet. Krysta thought his name was Bastien, but was having trouble keeping up.</p><p>As her own attention was drawn that way, she noticed for the third or fourth time that the forbidding immortal across from Sheldon was staring at her.</p> <p>Roland? Was that his name?</p><p>Krysta didn\u2019t know what it was about him, but he unnerved her more than anyone else present. He just seemed menacing. Like he could slit your throat, then sit down, prop his feet on your corpse, and eat a sandwich.</p><p>Uneasy, she looked up at Etienne. \u201cWho else could be in a unique position to share this information?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Roland growled.</p><p>Etienne frowned. \u201cNo one at this table would betray us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking of someone at this table,\u201d he intoned. \u201cWe all know the mercenaries\u2019 goal. At least the goal of those we fought before. They know vampires swiftly lose their mental faculties and immortals don\u2019t. They need to capture one of us so they can torture and dissect us and figure out why. Once they do, they intend to use the virus and whatever information they can glean from us to create an army of supersoldiers they can hire out to the highest bidder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Sean breathed. \u201cThey could make billions.\u201d</p><p>David nodded. \u201cAnd wreak havoc upon the world. No human army could stand against an army of immortals. Or a more expendable army of vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy expendable?\u201d Sean questioned.</p><p>\u201cAny human soldiers they intentionally infected with the virus would have to be slain a year later to ensure their leaders could maintain control.\u201d</p><p>One year? \u201cThe madness kicks in that fast?\u201d Krysta asked. No wonder she had never encountered a sane or non-murderous vampire.</p><p>\u201cIt varies from human to human and can be accelerated by things like poor living conditions or torture,\u201d David explained. \u201cSometimes vampires begin to lose impulse control and experience psychotic breaks six months after infection. Sometimes, if they are extraordinarily strong, they can have three or four years before lucidity abandons them. Since the change can be insidious and difficult to detect in the beginning, the mercenary leaders would have to limit the lifespan of their soldiers in order to prevent chaos and collateral damage.\u201d</p><p>Damn. Krysta wondered how that would work. Would the soldiers volunteer to be infected? Would they even understand what they would be infected with? Would they know, going in, that they would be killed a year later? Or would that caveat be kept from them?</p> <p>\u201cI think we all know what happened,\u201d Roland spoke again, \u201cwhy mercenaries have risen against us once more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Etienne said.</p><p>Several others nodded. They truly seemed baffled.</p><p>Roland shook his head. \u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? Someone at the network betrayed us.\u201d</p><p>Chris slammed a hand down on the table. \u201cBullshit!\u201d</p><p>Krysta jumped.</p><p>Unperturbed, Roland returned his irate stare. \u201cOne of your mortal pets decided a billion dollars in his bank account sounded pretty damned good and sold us out. Probably one of your techno-geeps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeeks,\u201d his wife murmured, chewing her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Roland! My people are handpicked and loyal to the core. You have no reason to doubt them beyond your massive paranoia and I\u2019m sick of you trying to dump that shit on my doorstep!\u201d</p><p>Roland\u2019s eyes flashed amber.</p><p>Krysta\u2019s heartbeat picked up nervously.</p><p>Etienne reached across her lap and rested a hand on the thigh farthest from him as though readying himself to sweep her behind him if all hell broke loose.</p><p>From the corner of her eye, she saw Sean palm a dagger under the table.</p><p>Oh, crap.</p><p>Roland leaned forward. \u201cI doubt everyone because of what you call my massive paranoia. Experience has taught me that even those I trust the most could stab me in the back. And have. However, I doubt your people and think them responsible for this new threat because it is the only plausible explanation. No one else knew. No one else could gain access to the tranquilizer, of which you keep a substantial supply at network headquarters. A network employee or employees, therefore, must be responsible.\u201d</p><p>Judging by the looks of things, Roland wasn\u2019t the only one present who thought so now that he had suggested it.</p><p>Chris was furious. \u201cThat isn\u2019t the only explanation. Maybe one of the memory wipes didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe memory wipes worked,\u201d Seth said. \u201cHad Etienne or Lisette handled the memories, then I would be concerned.\u201d</p><p>Krysta looked at Etienne, who shrugged. I told you there were limits to my telepathic abilities. I am only a couple hundred years old.</p><p>Uh-huh. Just a couple, she thought back to him. A veritable infant.</p><p>His lips twitched. But he kept his hand on her thigh and didn\u2019t relax.</p><p>\u201cHowever, David and I handled it,\u201d Seth continued. \u201cAny memories we bury never see the light of day again.\u201d</p><p>Jenna slowly raised a hand.</p><p>Seth smiled. \u201cYes, Jenna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m confused. Do you erase the memories or bury them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe bury them. Truly wiping them or erasing them can cause brain damage and scarring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Roland leaned back. \u201cAnd thus my point is proven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Chris said, \u201cwe must have missed something on the technical side. A laptop or a DVD or an exterior hard drive one of the mercenaries took home.\u201d</p><p>David shook his head. \u201cWe searched their minds before we buried the pertinent memories. If someone so much as wrote themselves a note on a napkin and took it home with them, we found it and destroyed it.\u201d</p><p>Even though Etienne thought Chris wanted to interrogate her, Krysta actually found herself feeling sorry for him. The blond looked both furious and crushed at the idea that one of his own people may have strayed from the fold.</p><p>\u201cLook into it,\u201d Seth told him. \u201cIt\u2019s the most logical hypothesis. Someone at the network must have taken information to another mercenary group and sold them the tranquilizer. Narrow down the possibilities.\u201d</p><p>Stone-faced, Chris nodded.</p><p>\u201cSeconds,\u201d David said, \u201cmake sure your immortals have an ample supply of the antidote and don\u2019t let them leave the house without it.\u201d</p><p>The mortals around the table nodded.</p><p>Seth leaned back. \u201cImmortals, start carrying your infrared goggles and scopes again and check periodically for heat signatures in shadows even your acute vision cannot penetrate. If you are struck with a dart, get the hell out of there and call your Second. The younger immortals among us should consider returning to hunting in pairs. For now, I leave the decision up to you. That will change if another mercenary attack ensues.\u201d</p><p>Bastien cleared his throat. \u201cWe should also step up our attempts to recruit vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Krysta blurted, then flushed when everyone looked at her.</p><p>\u201cThe ones who have not yet entirely lost their sanity,\u201d he clarified. \u201cWe can\u2019t risk the mercenaries getting their hands on the virus by capturing a vampire, so we must convince the vampires we\u2019re the lesser of two evils and see if we can\u2019t bring them over to our side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just kill them all?\u201d she asked. No way in hell would she partner with a freaking vampire.</p><p>Marcus smiled. \u201cI like this woman.\u201d</p><p>Roland nodded.</p><p>Bastien shook his head. \u201cThe point is to have them spread the word to the other vampires that they should do everything they can to stay out of the hands of the human mercenaries. We can\u2019t let the soldiers get their hands on the virus.\u201d</p><p>Seth nodded. \u201cDo it. I know you don\u2019t like it, but vampires outnumber us and could be a valuable tool we could use to thwart our new enemies. Recruit those you can. Kill the rest. David, have you anything you wish to add?\u201d</p><p>The other elder looked to Chris. \u201cOnly that I will make myself available anytime you wish me to examine the thoughts of network employees you think may be involved in this.\u201d</p><p>Chris gave an abrupt nod.</p><p>\u201cAll right\u201d Seth said. \u201cMeeting adjourned. Safe hunting, everyone.\u201d</p><p>Several mumbled a response.</p><p>Etienne\u2019s hand on Krysta\u2019s thigh relaxed.</p><p>\u201cEtienne,\u201d David said as they rose, \u201cwould you, Krysta, Sean, and Cameron join Seth, Chris, and I in my study?\u201d</p><p>Krysta cursed inwardly. They had been that close to getting away unscathed.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Etienne responded.</p><p>Seth strode around the table, Chris on his heels, and joined David as he walked through the throng and crossed the living room.</p><p>Trying to ignore the stares she drew, Krysta peered through the black-clad bodies and glimpsed a wicker basket on the floor near one of the sofas. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kittens?</p><p>The multicolored fur pile shifted, revealing a little triangle-shaped face.</p><p>Yes, kittens. In a house full of incredibly powerful men and women who instantly seemed less intimidating.</p> <p>Well, everyone except Roland and the two elders.</p><p>She returned her gaze to Seth and David\u2019s broad backs.</p><p>Following them to the study, she felt a bit like a child being called to the principal\u2019s office. To distract herself she studied the elders\u2019 auras.</p><p>So bright and beautiful. Almost mesmerizing.</p><p>You\u2019re drooling, Etienne spoke in her mind.</p> <p>Krysta detected a bit of rancor in his tone. What?</p><p>You can\u2019t take your eyes off them.</p><p>It isn\u2019t what you think. Their auras are different.</p><p>He rested a hand on her lower back. Different from what?</p><p>Different from yours. From mine. From vampires\u2019. From humans\u2019. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.</p><p>The two elders shared a look as they entered a darkened hallway.</p> <p>Were they listening?</p><p>David and Seth paused before an open doorway and motioned for them to enter.</p><p>Etienne and Krysta proceeded inside, followed by Chris, Cameron, and Sean, then the elders. As Seth started to close the door, Darnell slipped inside.</p><p>Smiling, Seth closed the door.</p><p>Nice study. Books lined floor-to-ceiling shelves on every wall, and the room had ten- or twelve-foot ceilings. The little home she and Sean rented had ceilings that ranged from eight feet to a mere six and a half. These men wouldn\u2019t even be able to stand upright in her kitchen, so she imagined they appreciated the extra headroom here.</p><p>Potted plants abounded, filling the room with color. A massive desk had been planted close enough to the large windows to allow anyone seated in the chair behind it to benefit from the natural light without sitting directly in it. Five chairs faced the desk. Two looked as though they had been there for years. Three more appeared to be new additions, probably added for this little get-together.</p><p>Some distance away, a smaller desk resided, something vaguely feminine in its appearance.</p><p>As they all congregated near the large desk, she waited anxiously to see what would happen. Would the interrogation Etienne feared begin now? Would they threaten her? Threaten Sean? Bury their memories of all of this?</p> <p>Did they think her in league with the mercenaries? She had killed two of them. Didn\u2019t that count for anything and show where her loyalties lay?</p><p>Wait. Was she saying she was loyal to the immortals?</p><p>She thought about everything she had learned at the meeting and from her time with Etienne.</p><p>Hell. Why not? They seemed like good guys.</p><p>Seth and David smiled.</p><p>Seth held out his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Krysta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She took it. And, wow, was it large. Her own hand looked like a child\u2019s in his. \u201cThank you. It\u2019s nice to meet you, too.\u201d</p><p>He covered their clasped hands with his other hand. Her own heated with a tingling warmth that swept up her arm and rippled through her body.</p><p>She gasped. \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d</p><p>He patted her hand, then released her and shook Sean\u2019s hand. \u201cI healed your injuries,\u201d he said as he stepped back.</p><p>She looked at Sean, whose eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>Seth nodded. \u201cThe older the immortal, the stronger his or her gifts.\u201d</p><p>Beside him, David smiled. \u201cThe two of us have lived so long and seen so much that very little surprises us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two surprised us,\u201d Seth admitted. \u201cWe are very impressed with your successes and all that you have accomplished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She had been more impressed herself before she had found out that they hadn\u2019t even made a dent in the vampire population.</p><p>\u201cMortal vampire hunters, particularly those who hunt alone or in small numbers, have traditionally had very short careers. The fact that you have been doing what you do for six years now and still possess all of your limbs is nothing short of extraordinary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d David said, \u201chave a seat.\u201d</p><p>Krysta and Sean took the two chairs in the middle. Etienne sat beside Krysta with Cam on his other side. Chris sat beside Sean. Darnell carried another chair from the corner over and placed it beside David, who took the chair behind the desk. Seth sat beside him.</p><p>Darnell stood beside David.</p><p>\u201cAs I said earlier,\u201d Seth began, \u201cI am the leader of the Immortal Guardians. David is my Second in Command. We are the highest authorities in the Immortal Guardian world. We know you are both gifted ones. All immortals were gifted ones before being infected with the virus, so we hope you will consider us your brethren.\u201d</p><p>David nodded. \u201cIt is how we think of you. As one of us. As family.\u201d</p><p>That was not what she had expected. What were they saying exactly?</p><p>Seth smiled. \u201cWe would like you to join us.\u201d</p><p>Sean looked at Krysta. \u201cAre you saying you want to infect us with the virus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily. Because you are gifted ones, you can safely transform without suffering brain damage and losing your sanity. But it is not a requirement. Many mortals, both humans and gifted ones, work with us and aid us in our desire to eliminate the vampire threat.\u201d</p><p>Krysta stared at them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I thought you were going to interrogate us or threaten us or castigate us for whatever wrong this one here\u201d\u2014she hooked a thumb in Chris\u2019s direction\u2014\u201cimagines we\u2019ve committed.\u201d</p><p>Darnell laughed.</p><p>Chris sighed. \u201cHad I met with you earlier today, I would have interviewed you.\u201d</p><p>Darnell coughed. \u201cInterrogated.\u201d</p><p>Chris scowled. \u201cBut since Seth and David have cleared you and determined you aren\u2019t a threat, that won\u2019t be necessary and I would welcome you on our side.\u201d</p><p>Krysta slid a look in Etienne\u2019s direction. You\u2019re being awfully quiet.</p><p>He arched a brow. This is your decision. I thought you wouldn\u2019t appreciate my weighing in on it.</p><p>Do you think I should join you?</p><p>Hell, yes.</p><p>She returned her attention to the elders. \u201cIn what capacity?\u201d</p><p>Seth looked to Reordon. \u201cChris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean, since you\u2019re a healer and are already studying medicine\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I even want to know how you know that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Chris shrugged. \u201cOnce I had your name, I traced you to Duke. And Seth told me you were a healer. Anyway, we could use someone with your gifts and knowledge in our medical department. Should you decide to join us, we will pay off all of the student loan debt you\u2019ve accumulated.\u201d Which was considerable. \u201cAnd pay all future tuition. I\u2019m sure Dr. Lipton, the immortal woman who sat beside me at the table, would be happy to mentor you and appreciate your aid in her pursuit of a cure or treatment for the virus.\u201d</p><p>Krysta met her brother\u2019s gaze and knew he was thinking the same thing she was.</p><p>It sounded incredibly good. Too good. What\u2019s-the-catch good.</p><p>\u201cWe also,\u201d Chris continued, \u201cwould immediately put you on the payroll, so you could quit your current job as early as tomorrow. I recommend that you do that anyway to ensure the mercenaries can\u2019t trace you there as we did. Krysta, we\u2019d like you to train as a Second. Your fighting skills already exceed the needs of the position, so we would\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cA Second? Do they hunt vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot actively, no. They guard and assist the immortals who do and back them up whenever necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving up hunting.\u201d</p><p>Etienne swore. \u201cYou would be accomplishing the same goal without subjecting yourself to so much risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019m not giving up hunting,\u201d she insisted stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cNot even for a six-figure salary?\u201d Chris asked.</p><p>Six figures? Really?</p><p>No. Despite the temptation, she couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>Sean shook his head. \u201cKrys, don\u2019t be stupid. This is perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cYou still thought these people were our enemies and in league with the vampires an hour ago!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, clearly they aren\u2019t,\u201d he snapped. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t go on the way you have been. How many times have you nearly died in the past six years? In the past one or two? You\u2019ve been coming up against larger and larger numbers and even admitted yourself that you would have been killed twice in the past month if Etienne hadn\u2019t saved your ass!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose were exceptions,\u201d she protested, anger and panic rising. She couldn\u2019t stop hunting vampires and just sit on the sidelines. Hunting was what she did. It was who she was.</p><p>Sean snorted. \u201cThose exceptions nearly killed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop hunting,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cYou would still be contributing to the destruction of vampires,\u201d he insisted. \u201cYou\u2019d still be making a difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the way I want to.\u201d</p><p>He clamped his lips shut, his face tightening in anger. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re mortally injured and I die healing you?\u201d It had been her biggest fear all along. \u201cIt\u2019s an even greater possibility now than ever before because you\u2019re battling vampires and being hunted by mercenaries who are shooting at you,\u201d he pressed.</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cIf I suffer a fatal injury, you\u2019ll just have to let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I won\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>She did. And it killed her to think that he would die for her.</p><p>Her eyes began to burn as her throat thickened. She had promised herself she wouldn\u2019t stop hunting until the vampire threat had been eliminated. Not hunting would feel like giving up. She didn\u2019t want to give up. She wasn\u2019t ready to give up.</p><p>Etienne clear his throat. \u201cShe can hunt with me.\u201d</p><p>The silence that followed was deafening.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>While Etienne inwardly cursed himself in every language he knew, Krysta swung around to gape up at him in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Chris, Cam, and Sean spoke at the same time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He gritted his teeth. \u201cI said, she can hunt with me.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t what he wanted. He wanted Krysta safe, damn it. But when her brother had slapped her in the face with reality, the barriers of her mind had crumbled. He had heard every panicked thought and hadn\u2019t been able to bear her unhappiness and dismay.</p><p>Seth and David glanced at each other, then examined Krysta and Etienne for several long moments, during which he suspected they were communicating telepathically.</p> <p>If Seth and David nixed the idea . . .</p><p>Seth met Etienne\u2019s gaze. \u201cShe\u2019ll be a liability.\u201d</p><p>Krysta did not like hearing that. A dozen denials immediately flooded her mind, overriding the panicked despair.</p><p>But Etienne couldn\u2019t contradict it.</p><p>David drew Krysta\u2019s gaze. \u201cThough they don\u2019t like it, immortals\u2019 orders are very clear. If they are tranqed, they are to immediately flee the battle in order to avoid being captured and call their Seconds before they lose consciousness. When the two of you were attacked by mercenaries, Etienne put himself in a position where he would likely be captured in order to keep them from killing you.\u201d</p> <p>She lost some of her fight. \u201cBut I kept them from taking him.\u201d</p><p>Seth acknowledged her words with a slight nod. \u201cHad he been hunting alone, however, he would not have lingered once he saw that first dart. He would have gotten away without further injury.\u201d</p><p>Quiet descended upon them, heavy and uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cKrysta,\u201d Chris said, \u201cyou have to understand that, if you and Sean join us, your actions will affect us all. If you had been shot despite Etienne\u2019s efforts to keep you safe, he would have been captured, tortured, and killed before we could even identify whoever the hell our new enemy is. The mercenaries would have then obtained both the virus and the DNA evidence they need to build their research and their army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fault was not entirely Krysta\u2019s,\u201d Etienne mentioned. \u201cI thought the mercenary threat over. Had I not been so caught off guard by their reappearance, I would have reacted faster and likely could have gotten us both out of there before they could hit me with a second dart.\u201d</p><p>Cam shook his head. \u201cI could just as easily argue that you may have noticed the mercenaries\u2019 approach and not been so caught off guard if Krysta hadn\u2019t been distracting you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t make the same mistake twice,\u201d Etienne insisted.</p><p>Another long moment passed.</p><p>Krysta fidgeted.</p><p>Sean said nothing.</p><p>Etienne didn\u2019t have as much difficulty reading Sean as he did Krysta. The younger man was hoping the elders would forbid Krysta from hunting. Not because he feared he might die healing her, but because he feared she might be so badly injured one night that she would die before he could reach her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to lose his sister.</p><p>Don\u2019t make me regret this, Seth spoke in Etienne\u2019s head. \u201cI will allow it for now,\u201d he decreed.</p><p>Much to Etienne\u2019s surprise, Krysta didn\u2019t smile with relief.</p> <p>\u201cUntil we have eliminated the mercenary threat,\u201d he continued. \u201cI would like the two of you to either stay here at David\u2019s home . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are both welcome for as long as you wish,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201c. . . or remain with Etienne at his,\u201d Seth continued. \u201cYou have both now become targets of the mercenaries and will fare better with an immortal\u2019s protection.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the meeting comprised logistics. The siblings opted to stay with Etienne, who couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the decision. Sean would have to refrain from attending classes until this was resolved, but would spend time at network headquarters working with Dr. Lipton and gaining a greater understanding of the virus in the meantime. Krysta would hunt with Etienne at night and train with him during the day.</p><p>Etienne was happier than he would\u2019ve thought about that. Was he already so drawn to her that he would use any excuse to spend time with her? Even if it put her in danger?</p><p>Which it wouldn\u2019t. He would keep her safe and ensure no harm befell her.</p><p>The ride home was quiet.</p><p>When Cam and Sean headed into the house, Etienne held Krysta back.</p><p>Guards still walked the perimeter, he noted, but those near the house had been dismissed.</p><p>She crossed her arms under her breasts and avoided his gaze.</p><p>Once the door closed behind the others, Etienne tilted her chin up. \u201cWhat troubles you?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, he thought she wouldn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cAm I really a liability?\u201d she asked, voice low.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how to answer that, whether he should be honest or sugarcoat it. Since he would\u2019ve preferred to hear the truth if he were in her position, he opted for that. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you agree to hunt with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know how much hunting means to you. And, though the thought of you continuing to hunt terrifies me, I want you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>At last, she met his gaze. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I care about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou barely know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been following you and learning everything I can about you since the night we met. I\u2019ve listened to your conversations with your brother. I\u2019ve caught occasional glimpses of your thoughts. I\u2019ve fought beside you, both when you were awake and while you dreamed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was you in my dream?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and tucked her hair behind one ear to expose her troubled features to the moonlight. \u201cI know you,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>She chewed her lower lip. \u201cI don\u2019t want to endanger you, Etienne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have. I don\u2019t want you to sacrifice yourself for me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the risk of angering you, in this instance I don\u2019t care what you want. If hunting endangers your life, I will do whatever it takes to protect you.\u201d He rested a hand on her lower back and urged her toward the door.</p><p>He loved touching her. Even casually. And he loved that she let him.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he said while she pondered his words, \u201cyou\u2019ve already donned hunting clothes. And filched some of the weapons my sister left in her room. Before we embark on the night\u2019s hunt, you may have your pick of the weapons in my armory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re hunting tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re up to it.\u201d</p><p>At last he won a faint smile from her. \u201cI don\u2019t know. What if you don\u2019t have all of the weapons I need?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m sure we can find something.\u201d</p><p>A minute later his smile broadened as Krysta surveyed, with wide eyes and gaping mouth, the vast array of weaponry in his armory.</p><p>\u201cHo-ly crap!\u201d she breathed.</p><p>Etienne laughed. \u201cThink you can make do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . . yeah. But it may take me several hours to choose.\u201d</p><p>It was quite a selection. He usually kept on hand enough swords of varying lengths and styles, daggers, throwing stars, and more to outfit himself, his brother, his sister, and their three Seconds on any given night. With some left over for immortal visitors.</p><p>She strolled around the room, studying the blades displayed on the walls. \u201cCould I just say holy crap again?\u201d</p><p>Again he laughed. \u201cThis is only the portion of my collection that I keep in this home.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him curiously. \u201cYou have others?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIn various countries. Many immortals own multiple homes. When we\u2019ve been stationed in one place for long periods of time, it\u2019s sometimes hard to move on and abandon what we\u2019ve built there.\u201d</p><p>She stopped before a pair of red-handled shoto swords. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cBe my guest.\u201d</p><p>She drew one down and slid it from its gleaming sheath. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister\u2019s weapon of choice. Though, since the vampire population in this area has swelled, she has also begun to carry a couple of Glocks.\u201d He closed the distance between them. \u201cHere.\u201d He reached for the sword. \u201cLet me serve as your Second tonight.\u201d</p><p>While she stood patiently before him, her eyes never leaving his face, he armed her with all of the weapons he knew she preferred to carry. Shoto swords in sheaths she could conceal beneath a coat. Daggers, in case she was disarmed.</p><p>His heartbeat picked up as he knelt and fastened sheaths to her slender thighs. Rising, he moved even closer to her (just because) and unfastened the belt that rode low on her hips and fell beneath her belly button.</p><p>Her pulse picked up, mirroring his own.</p><p>Slowly, he drew the belt from the first couple of loops on her cargo pants. Once the end was free, he slipped a gun holster onto it, then began threading the belt back through the loops. As he refastened it, he drew in a deep breath and savored her scent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really a gun kind of girl,\u201d she whispered, leaning forward to nuzzle his throat.</p><p>His body hardened.</p><p>\u201cTonight you will be,\u201d he murmured gruffly, fingers fumbling with the narrow buckle. \u201cI want you to carry a tranquilizer pistol.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back. \u201cYou want me to tranq the vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose I deem salvageable. I don\u2019t suppose I could talk you into carrying a Glock as well, could I? In case we come up against more mercenaries?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI\u2019m afraid the extra holsters and weight of the ammo will restrict my movements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll carry it for you and toss it to you should the need arise,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He gave the belt one last tug, then hesitantly withdrew his hands. \u201cYou do know how to use it, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Even her confidence turned him on. \u201cI do so love strong women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour eyes are glowing,\u201d she commented softly.</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. Dipping his head, Etienne captured her lips with his own, pouring all of the passion he felt for her into the contact. As it had before, the brush of her lips struck him like lightning, firing his desire like no other ever had. He wrapped his arms around her and drew her up against him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Breath catching, she rose onto her toes and slid her arms around his neck, pressing her breasts to his chest, her hips to his arousal.</p><p>He swore silently when she tore her lips from his.</p><p>\u201cI want you, too,\u201d she admitted.</p> <p>He groaned and kissed her again, teasing her lips apart and sliding his tongue within to stroke and dance with hers.</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d Cam blurted.</p><p>Etienne had been so distracted, he hadn\u2019t even heard his Second approach.</p><p>\u201cAh, hell,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI knew it! I knew she was falling for him!\u201d</p><p>Krysta dropped onto her heels, her lips abruptly leaving his.</p> <p>He tightened his hold momentarily before letting her go with a sigh.</p><p>Cam stared at him as Krysta took a couple of steps back and sheepishly met her brother\u2019s unsettled gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Etienne demanded irritably.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Cam responded. \u201cJust . . . I didn\u2019t think you had it in you.\u201d</p><p>Krysta frowned. \u201cWe were just kissing. It\u2019s not like you walked in on us having sex.\u201d</p><p>Etienne fought back another groan. Don\u2019t put that image in my head. I\u2019ll be hard all night.</p> <p>She tossed him a startled look, then grinned. Nice.</p><p>He shook his head. Not when we\u2019re fighting vampires, it isn\u2019t.</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t knock it,\u201d Cam told Krysta, pointing at Etienne. \u201cKissing is big for this guy. He hasn\u2019t been on a single date since I started serving as his Second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? How long have you been his Second?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout as long as you\u2019ve been hunting vampires.\u201d</p><p>She winked at Etienne. \u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>Damned if that didn\u2019t make him want her even more.</p> <p>Shaking his head, he motioned for the door. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here before I do something that will embarrass you in front of your brother.\u201d</p><p>Sean held up a hand, alarm crossing his features. \u201cWait. You\u2019re just going hunting, right?\u201d</p><p>Krysta rolled her eyes. \u201cNo, we\u2019re going to park in Lovers\u2019 Lane and spend the next several hours making out. Of course, we\u2019re going hunting.\u201d She headed past the duo and out into the hallway.</p><p>Cam raised his eyebrows as Etienne approached. \u201cYou have everything you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be here if you need us.\u201d</p><p>Etienne followed Krysta down the hallway and out the front door. \u201cRelax,\u201d he heard Cam say inside. \u201cEtienne is a good guy. You can trust him.\u201d</p><p>Cam was a good guy, too. Steady. Somber. Reliable. (Unlike Sheldon, who was still learning and could be a handful.)</p><p>Etienne\u2019s last Second had been killed in a car accident. Etienne hadn\u2019t been able to believe it at the time. The man had survived twenty-five years of backing up an immortal who hunted vampires for a living, then had died because some dumbass had been too busy texting to stop for a red light.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Krysta said, skipping down the front steps, \u201chow are we going to do this? Do you pick the campus we investigate or do I and how will we get there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I would pick the place\u2014I\u2019m thinking Duke again\u2014and drive us there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuke sounds great and, for some reason, you driving a car seems weird.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and led the way to the Tesla Model S Cam had backed out of the garage for him while he and Krysta were in the armory. \u201cWhy? Because I can run as fast as one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And that is totally cool.\u201d</p><p>It really was.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of cool,\u201d she said, admiring the shiny black sedan, \u201cthis is nice. Very sleek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. It\u2019s electric.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows flew up. \u201cAre you serious? I thought all electric cars looked like a toddler\u2019s shoe. This . . . looks like money.\u201d</p><p>He opened the passenger door for her. \u201cI like it, too. There are zero emissions, so my sensitive nose gets a break from exhaust fumes, and I can go up to three hundred miles on a charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaaaaaamn. I\u2014and my bank account\u2014really need one of these. The price of gas has been kicking my ass.\u201d</p><p>He smiled down at her as she sank into the comfortable seat and fastened her seat belt. \u201cYou\u2019ll get one if you come to work for us. Every job working for the Immortal Guardians comes with a low or no emission, fuel efficient car of your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSean will get one, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. We\u2019ll each have our own car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d He closed the door, zipped around to the driver\u2019s side, and sank into the seat Cam had pushed all the way back from the steering wheel.</p><p>The engine started as he buckled his seat belt.</p><p>Krysta\u2019s eyes widened, then fastened on the touch screen.</p><p>Hell, if a cool car would entice her to join them, he\u2019d see that she got two of them. He really didn\u2019t want her to continue hunting. She was mortal. Vulnerable. Fragile. It was only a matter of time before tragedy struck.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t want to think about that.</p><p>Krysta strolled through Duke\u2019s campus, Etienne at her side. Her mind raced with everything she had learned earlier. Her heart raced at his nearness.</p><p>Oddly, it almost felt as if they were out on a date.</p><p>Maybe he was just naturally gallant, opening the car door for her, often guiding her with a hand on her lower back. Even his speech sometimes seemed old worldish.</p><p>He was from another era.</p><p>\u201cThis is so weird,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d he asked, his sharp eyes searching every shadow.</p><p>He had said he loved strong women. Well, apparently she adored strong men, because in his warrior mode he was breath-stealingly, heart-racingly appealing.</p><p>Tearing her gaze away from her gorgeous companion, Krysta kept an eye out for glowing orange auras. \u201cMe walking and talking with a man born in the nineteenth century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I was born in the eighteenth century. Seventeen eighty three, to be exact.\u201d</p><p>Unreal. She was lusting after a man born over two hundred years before she had been born. \u201cSo, you lived through the French Revolution?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThe Reign of Terror.\u201d</p><p>Honestly she had forgotten almost everything she had learned about the French Revolution and knew only the dates (roundabout) and that thousands had died under the guillotine. She wanted to ask if he had lost anyone to Madame Guillotine, but thought it too morbid. \u201cThat must have been . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad,\u201d he said, his face clouding.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have said anything.</p><p>Then she realized . . . \u201cYou lived during Napoleon\u2019s reign?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. Glancing at her from the corner of his eye, he smiled faintly. \u201cYour mouth is hanging open again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet it is.\u201d This was so crazy. \u201cWas Napoleon really short like everyone says?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many languages do you speak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot many. I\u2019m fluent in half a dozen or so and know a phrase here or there in half a dozen more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlder immortals know far more. Seth knows them all. David, too, most likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven those that have long since been forgotten.\u201d</p><p>Krysta wished she were fluent in more than one language. She had learned Spanish in high school, but had forgotten most of it. And her college career had been cut short by a vampire attack and her resulting obsession with hunting vamps.</p><p>\u201cSay something else in French,\u201d she requested.</p><p>A series of lilting indecipherable words flowed smoothly from his tongue.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d she asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cSomething I can\u2019t repeat without you either blushing furiously or striking me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it naughty?\u201d she asked with a smile.</p><p>His smile turned wicked. \u201cVery naughty.\u201d</p><p>Now she really wanted to know what he had said.</p><p>\u201cDoes it trouble you?\u201d he asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You talking dirty to me in French?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and shook his head. \u201cNo, that I\u2019ve lived so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d And she wasn\u2019t sure why. \u201cMaybe because you don\u2019t look your age.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cI should hope not.\u201d</p><p>Quiet fell.</p><p>A breeze ruffled their hair. His, she knew from burying her fingers in it, was thick and as soft as silk.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t working,\u201d he pronounced.</p><p>Crap. She shouldn\u2019t have brought up his age. \u201cWhy? Is it because you think I\u2019m too young for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He stopped walking and faced her. \u201cNo. I was talking about our . . . outing.\u201d Hunt, he added in her head, in case someone out of sight was listening.</p><p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t too young for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cDo you think you\u2019re too young for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both adults.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be cultural differences, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould make things more interesting.\u201d</p><p>He looked around, eyes sharp. Returning his attention to her, he tilted his head to one side. Moonlight filtered down through the trees and highlighted his handsome face. \u201cWhat do you say we do this your way?\u201d</p><p>Krysta wasn\u2019t sure how to answer that. Were they talking about pursuing their attraction to each other or hunting? Or both? \u201cWhat exactly are we talking about?\u201d she asked, just to be sure.</p><p>His lips twitched. \u201cI was talking about our outing. Why? What were you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she hit him in the shoulder. \u201cStop teasing me.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cAbsolutely not. I\u2019m enjoying it too much.\u201d Again, he surveyed the campus around them. \u201cAs much as I love your delightful company, I think I should leave now. I\u2019ve work to do and the night is passing quickly.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and smiled again. \u201cGo do your thing.\u201d</p><p>Was he actually giving her the go-ahead to act as bait? She had assumed he intended to do all the hunting himself and was pretty much just letting her tag along.</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Though she regretted having to give up his company.</p><p>I\u2019ll monitor you from the rooftops, he added telepathically. Anytime you wish to speak to me, just direct your thoughts toward me as though I were standing before you and you were speaking them aloud and I should hear them.</p><p>Okay. Did you hear that?</p><p>He smiled. Yes.</p><p>Can you hear everything else I\u2019m thinking?</p> <p>He was silent a moment. No. Your barriers are still in place, so I can only hear what you wish me to hear.</p><p>Good.</p><p>He pursed his lips. Any naughty thoughts about me floating around up there?</p><p>Many many naughty thoughts.</p><p>He stepped closer to her. In case anyone is looking . . . Resting his hands on her waist, he drew her up against him and proceeded to kiss the stuffing out of her.</p><p>Fire licked through Krysta\u2019s veins as she locked her arms around his neck. Her heart pounded a rapid beat as he slid his hands up her rib cage, his thumbs nearing her tingling breasts.</p> <p>He murmured something in French in her mind.</p><p>Say it in English, she reminded him.</p><p>How you tempt me.</p><p>Good, because he tempted the hell out of her.</p><p>When he dragged his lips away, she was happy to discover his breathing was as ragged as hers.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d he said, voice low and hoarse.</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>Taking her hand, he raised it to his lips.</p> <p>Krysta didn\u2019t have to fake a stumble as she turned to walk away from him. Her knees were weak. All this time she had thought that was just corny crap found in chick flicks. She hadn\u2019t realized passion really could weaken your knees.</p><p>She shook her head at herself. She was twenty-seven years old and no virgin. She should already know that, shouldn\u2019t she?</p><p>As she walked up the sidewalk, exploring the quadrangles that hosted her favorite frat houses, she caught periodic glimpses of Etienne\u2019s pretty white and purple aura leaping from roof to roof.</p><p>She wished she could do that. That would be so much fun.</p><p>Testing. Testing. Can you hear me? she asked.</p><p>He laughed. Yes.</p><p>When you said we\u2019d be hunting together, I didn\u2019t think you meant as we have been.</p><p>I may not like it, but you do make good bait.</p><p>She was getting used to hearing his warm, deep voice in her head. Can I drunk dial you? Her fictional drunken phone calls worked well to distract any vamps tailing her.</p><p>Anytime we aren\u2019t hunting.</p><p>She smiled. I\u2019m not a big drinker.</p><p>Nor am I. Alcohol has no effect on us, so there isn\u2019t much point.</p><p>Oh. Well, I was just going to fake it anyway.</p><p>As you have before. I admit I found your rants both credible and entertaining.</p><p>That gave her a warm feeling.</p><p>But, he went on, if you were to call me, the vampires would hear your conversation both down there and through my phone up here, alerting them to my presence.</p><p>Oh. Your ears really are sensitive, aren\u2019t they?</p><p>Yes, as are vampires\u2019.</p><p>Bummer. I was going to talk dirty to you.</p><p>Damn. I hate to miss that.</p><p>Maybe later. I could talk dirty to you mentally, she suggested boldly.</p><p>Very tempting, but it looks like you have some nibblers.</p><p>Vampires are taking the bait? she asked, staggering a bit to one side. Already?</p><p>Definitely. Two approach from your five and three more from your eight.</p><p>Ooh. I like this. No more guessing how many I\u2019ll face or trying to sneak a peek at them.</p><p>How did you live through six years of this?</p><p>I\u2019m good at what I do.</p><p>Just don\u2019t get cocky.</p><p>I won\u2019t. Any sign of mercenaries?</p><p>Silence. No. Nothing with my eyes. Nothing with the infrared. What about you? Any human auras lurking in odd places?</p><p>She paused at a crosswalk and looked around as though trying to remember where she wanted to go. The vampires scattered like cockroaches, their auras leading the way.</p><p>No. No humans.</p><p>Good.</p><p>Half singing under her breath, she led the vamps away from the frat houses, past eating establishments that would have been packed with students only a couple of hours earlier, and toward the science buildings that would give them a little more privacy and be less likely to draw the attention of anyone out and about this late.</p><p>Adrenaline surged through her veins as she ducked into a darkened area she suspected was used for deliveries and paused. It was the closest thing to an alley nearby and would have to do. Reaching beneath her coat, she drew her borrowed shoto swords and spun around. \u201cHi, guys.\u201d</p><p>Those vamps who had already bent forward in a menacing crouch, intending to taunt and frighten her, frowned. Straightening, they looked at each other, then her.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cI believe this is where I\u2019m supposed to say: It\u2019s on.\u201d</p><p>Etienne appeared behind the vamps at the mouth of the pseudo-alley, swords drawn. \u201cActually,\u201d he countered. \u201cit\u2019s not on. Did you forget we need to talk to them first?\u201d</p><p>The vamps spun to face Etienne, drawing weapons they had thought they wouldn\u2019t need to slaughter a drunk sorority girl.</p><p>Krysta swore. \u201cYes, I did. I see now why that grumpy older guy didn\u2019t want to do this. It kinda ruins the flow of it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d one vamp asked, looking back and forth between them.</p><p>\u201cAn Immortal Guardian,\u201d one sneered, his eyes flashing a bright blue as they slid to Krysta. \u201cAnd his mortal Second.\u201d</p><p>The others\u2019 eyes flared to life in a variety of colors. Some actually hissed liked movie vampires did.</p><p>Etienne raced right through their midst and planted himself in front of Krysta.</p><p>Damn it! She shifted to the side, far enough away not to hamper his swing.</p><p>\u201cKill them!\u201d the first vampire snarled.</p><p>Etienne raised one of his swords and pointed it at them almost like a teacher singling out a student for behaving badly. \u201cGentlemen, I suggest you slow your roll.\u201d Over his shoulder, he murmured, \u201cThat\u2019s a saying, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>It was kind of hard to be miffed at him when he made her want to laugh. \u201cYes.\u201d Was he trying to use modern slang to make himself seem younger to her after their little conversation?</p><p>He focused once more on the vampires. \u201cWe have some information that might interest you.\u201d</p><p>They responded with a lot of posturing and spewing of epithets.</p><p>\u201cHuman mercenaries are hunting you,\u201d Etienne went on doggedly. \u201cThey want to capture you, torture you to learn about the virus and your abilities, then kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of bullshit is that?\u201d one blurted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bullshit is what it is,\u201d another answered.</p><p>So clever, that one.</p><p>\u201cYeah, since when do immortals want to help vampires?\u201d</p><p>Etienne sighed. \u201cSince any information the mercenaries gain from torturing you can be used against us. These humans are enemies of both of us. If we work together . . .\u201d</p><p>Weapons still at the ready, Krysta glanced at him when he trailed off.</p><p>The vampires shifted and exchanged confused looks. At least those who weren\u2019t twitching with the need to attack.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d Etienne said finally. \u201cThis is pointless. Every vampire here is so insane they\u2019re making my head hurt.\u201d He swung his swords with a flourish and met her gaze. \u201cNow it\u2019s on.\u201d</p><p>He blurred, shooting forward with incredible speed. Blood sprayed as carotid arteries sprang leaks in the wake of his blades. Two vampires swung their weapons wildly, then sank to their knees, hands grasping their throats and trying futilely to staunch the flow of their life\u2019s blood. A third engaged Etienne, the battling duo blurring and zipping around like the Tazmanian Devil.</p><p>The two remaining vamps faced Krysta with evil smiles. Their orange auras streaked toward her a second before their forms leapt forward. She swung her blades, scoring hits that sparked snarls of fury. And retaliation.</p><p>She began a slow trek backward as she swung where their auras directed her. Her thigh stung as one of their blades cut through her clothing and hit flesh. Then her side. Her hip. Her swings and thrusts neither ceased nor slowed.</p><p>Something large flew over her head and hit the brick wall to her right hard enough to shower them with dust. The vampire Etienne fought?</p><p>One of her opponents slowed and stumbled, dropping the bowie he had swung wildly. Blood poured from his wrist and neck.</p><p>About freaking time! It usually didn\u2019t take her that long to find the arteries. She was off her game tonight.</p><p>The other vampire jerked backward, then hit the wall beside the other one.</p><p>Etienne was on him so fast she couldn\u2019t see exactly what he did. But when he stilled and stepped back, the blades of his swords dripped crimson liquid and the vamp began to shrivel up.</p><p>Breathing hard, Krysta lowered her weapons.</p><p>Etienne turned to her, eyes glowing a vibrant amber. Ruby droplets speckled his face and glistened on his clothing. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and smiled. \u201cWe rock!\u201d</p><p>Some of the tension left his shoulders. Shaking his head, he wiped his blades on his coat and sheathed them. \u201cWhere are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m hurt?\u201d She didn\u2019t want to admit it. If he knew she was injured every time she hunted, he might refuse to hunt with her again in an attempt to protect her and . . .</p><p>Well, she didn\u2019t know what would happen next. She\u2019d like to think she would just go back to hunting on her own, but doubted Etienne or the elder immortals would let her.</p><p>That galled a little.</p><p>Or a lot.</p><p>\u201cI can smell your blood,\u201d he said, closing the distance between them. \u201cAnd you\u2019re favoring one side.\u201d</p><p>Thwarted again by his acute senses and attention to detail.</p><p>Since she couldn\u2019t refute it, she settled for making nonsensical grumbly noises as she wiped her own blades clean and sheathed them.</p><p>\u201cKrysta.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a few cuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy left thigh, my left side, and my right hip.\u201d</p> <p>His jaw clenched. Leaning down, he swept her into his arms. Though he was careful not to touch any of her wounds, it still hurt.</p><p>\u201cI can walk,\u201d she insisted between teeth gritted against the pain.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up.\u201d</p><p>The world around her blurred. A strong breeze whipped through her hair, tugging it across her face.</p><p>When everything came back into focus and her hair fell away, she discovered they stood on top of a building down the street.</p> <p>\u201cWow. You weren\u2019t kidding when you said I couldn\u2019t keep up. What\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to take any chances. The mercenaries always seem to show themselves after the fight is over, as though they want to make sure they nab the immortal victor instead of the vampires.\u201d</p><p>Alarm rose. \u201cDid you see any closing in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Will you watch the battle scene for me while I inspect your wounds?\u201d He gingerly lowered her to her feet. \u201cAre you okay to stand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and yes. I really don\u2019t think the cuts are too deep. They just hurt. And stop looking like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike I\u2019ve suffered a mortal injury or something and you want to go back and kill the vampires again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He handed her his infrared scope. \u201cI would go back and kill the vampires again if I could. I don\u2019t like you getting hurt. I don\u2019t like you being in pain.\u201d</p><p>She raised the scope to her right eye and squeezed her left eye closed. The world appeared before her, normal black combined with weird shades of blue and purple and occasional splashes of yellow, orange, and red.</p><p>Etienne peeled her coat back and bent to check the wound at her waist. \u201cWhat do you see? Any humans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see a guy driving past in a truck. A couple back near the frat\u2014Jeeze! I think they\u2019re having sex! Euw! In the bushes? Who does that?\u201d</p><p>Was that a laugh?</p><p>She opened her left eye and checked.</p><p>Yes, she had wrung a smile from him. Good.</p> <p>She grunted when he prodded the cut. \u201cThat hurts, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt needs stitches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t. Just get me home. Sean will take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep looking,\u201d he instructed and turned his attention to her thigh. \u201cGood. They missed the artery.\u201d</p><p>She squinted through the scope again. \u201cYeah. What is it with vampires and hamstrings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re like lions trying to bring down a gazelle. They think to hobble you, then move in for the kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She turned in a complete circle, eliciting more French swear words from Etienne, who was still trying to examine her wounds. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing anything. I don\u2019t think they came tonight.\u201d</p><p>He waited for her to settle, then checked out her hip. \u201cThis one needs stitches, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit complaining.\u201d</p><p>He straightened and took the scope from her. \u201cI\u2019m not complaining. I\u2019m expressing concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re harshing my mellow. We defeated five vampires tonight. That\u2019s something to celebrate.\u201d</p><p>He raised the scope to his right eye and turned in a circle. \u201cI think if they were here they would have come out of hiding by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey certainly didn\u2019t dawdle the last time we encountered them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait here a moment. If you see anything, think a warning and I\u2019ll hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>He vanished. Or moved so swiftly he seemed to. But his aura helped her trace his movements as he returned to the area in which they had fought.</p><p>Krysta raised the scope to her eye and looked around. No mercenaries.</p><p>Ooh. His aura looked really freaky through the scope as it streaked back toward her.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, stopping before her. \u201cLet\u2019s call it a night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConfiscated the vampires\u2019 weapons and tossed their clothing into the Dumpster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s head for the car.\u201d</p><p>She halted him when he bent to lift her into his arms. \u201cI can walk, Etienne. Really. The wounds aren\u2019t that bad.\u201d</p><p>Brushing her hands aside, he lifted her into his arms anyway. \u201cThis is faster. And, if it will soothe your ego, you can tell yourself that I\u2019m not doing this because I think your injuries have weakened you. I\u2019m doing it because I was looking for an excuse to hold you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d she said, looping her arms around his neck. \u201cWhich one is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019re really going to do this?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunt together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the plan. At least for the time being.\u201d</p><p>Good. They made a great team. And the more time she spent with Etienne, the more time she wanted to spend with him.</p><p>Krysta combed her fingers through his thick locks. \u201cYour hair is so soft.\u201d</p><p>He smiled as the world blurred.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>David reclined in his comfy chair, his feet propped on the edge of his desk, as he devoured the latest Stephen King novel.</p><p>Seth lounged in a chair on the other side of the desk, his large boots also gracing the scarred wooden surface as he studied his cell phone.</p><p>Outside, the sun was high in the sky, its rays filtering in and brightening the room naturally.</p><p>The house was quiet, save the occasional snore. Marcus and Ami were fast asleep. Bastien and Melanie were, too, having opted yet again to spend the day at David\u2019s so Melanie could be near Ami.</p><p>Roland and Sarah had surprised them all by choosing to spend the day there as well. Seth thought Roland was beginning to pick up on Marcus\u2019s tension. Roland may be antisocial, but he was fiercely loyal. And Marcus had been a good friend to him over the centuries.</p><p>Even Darnell slumbered.</p><p>Seth and David should be getting some rest as well. So many needed their help on a nightly basis that both often went days without sleep. But, when one\u2019s sense of hearing was as acute as theirs, quiet was hard to come by and could often only be found during times like this.</p><p>\u201cI think our secret is out,\u201d Seth murmured.</p><p>David grunted and kept reading. A moment later he turned the page. \u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep getting messages from immortals wanting to know why there are so many gifted ones in this area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them it\u2019s something in the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. They didn\u2019t buy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoincidence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t buy that either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo smart for their own good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a lot of smarts. Word gets around. First Roland found a gifted one, then Bastien and Richart. They all think Marcus has found one, too.\u201d</p><p>David nodded, his eyes still on his coveted book. \u201cThis love thing is becoming an epidemic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd everyone wants to be infected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you blame them?\u201d</p><p>Seth sighed. \u201cNo. Happily ever after, when you live as long as we do, sounds . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhenomenal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He motioned to his phone. \u201cYou see? Another immortal requesting a transfer to North Carolina. They know something is up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think it will take them to connect the unusually high gifted one population to the presence of a network headquarters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but once they figure out we guide gifted ones to all areas that boast a network headquarters\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be hell to pay.\u201d</p><p>Seth nodded. \u201cThey\u2019ll think I\u2019m playing matchmaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd playing favorites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Everyone knows I\u2019m your favorite and yet I remain distressingly unattached.\u201d</p><p>Seth grinned. \u201cAngling for me to set you up on a blind date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Seth shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you. My record as a matchmaker sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBethany had a long, happy life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Marcus was miserable for centuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarcus wouldn\u2019t have found Ami if you hadn\u2019t inadvertently denied him Bethany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving me a headache.\u201d</p><p>David smiled.</p><p>Seth swore. \u201cI have to go. Friedrich needs me.\u201d</p><p>David looked up from his book. \u201cBe safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs always.\u201d</p><p>Seth vanished.</p><p>Sean watched Krysta and Etienne arm themselves. Last night had been both informative and nerve wracking. He felt reasonably sure now that the immortals were on their side and truly were different from vampires. He was a little less sure that Etienne wasn\u2019t messing with Krysta\u2019s head.</p><p>The man was telepathic and clearly attracted to her. How easy would it be for him to manipulate her thoughts and plant an interest in himself?</p><p>Because she was clearly interested. Sean hadn\u2019t seen Krysta this captivated by a man since before she had taken up vampire hunting.</p><p>Even when she had returned home from their hunt wounded last night, she had been unable to drag her gaze away from the Frenchman.</p><p>She laughed at something Etienne said.</p><p>She seemed to laugh a lot around him, too. Though it worried him, Sean had to admit it was good to see her in such high spirits.</p><p>Absently he rubbed his hip, where it still ached from healing her.</p><p>Cam had patiently answered all of Sean\u2019s questions while they had waited for the hunting duo to return. He had encouraged Sean to get some rest, but Sean had been unwilling to turn in until he had seen for himself that Krysta was okay.</p><p>He had healed her wounds without complaint, grateful as usual that they weren\u2019t fatal. Her eyes had sparkled with excitement as she had recounted their battle with five vampires. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She laughed again.</p><p>She really was taken with Etienne. Sean could understand her being grateful to the man for saving her life, but . . . was she really considering pursuing something romantic with him?</p><p>Hell. He supposed he couldn\u2019t blame her. The life they had led for the past six\u2014seven\u2014years had been a lonely one. Krysta hadn\u2019t been willing to give up or even cut back on her vampire hunting in order to date. And he hadn\u2019t been able to date while he was watching her back and racing to her rescue every night. Even when he had lucked out and found a woman who hadn\u2019t minded the weird-ass hours or the emergency calls that had interrupted their dates, he had had difficulty concocting plausible explanations for the wounds that had opened on his body when he had healed Krysta\u2019s. So he had dated as little as Krysta.</p> <p>He just wished Krysta would have fallen for Cam or one of the other Seconds instead of an immortal. That was a little hard to stomach.</p><p>Cam caught his eye. \u201cYou about ready?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Krysta raised her eyebrows. \u201cReady for what?\u201d</p><p>Sean straightened away from the doorjamb he had been propping up and entered. \u201cCam is taking me to network headquarters. I\u2019m going to be working with Dr. Lipton tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s the pretty brunet from the meeting, isn\u2019t she? The one married to Bastien?\u201d</p><p>Etienne nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s as fierce a fighter as you are, but doesn\u2019t hunt. She\u2019s been too valuable in the lab, searching for a cure for the virus. She\u2019s the one who developed the antidote to the tranquilizer the mercenaries use against us.\u201d He met Sean\u2019s gaze as he slid one last dagger into the sheaths sewn into the lining of his coat. \u201cShe\u2019ll be able to answer all of your questions regarding the virus, immortals, and vampires. Gifted ones, too.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded. He had a lot of questions.</p><p>\u201cI have a few questions myself,\u201d Krysta said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll answer them while we hunt,\u201d Etienne promised.</p><p>He had been surprisingly amiable toward Sean, considering Sean had woken him yesterday by pressing a blade to his throat.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s your sister. You\u2019d die to protect her. I understand that,\u201d Etienne had said.</p><p>Sean had doubted that until he had encountered Etienne\u2019s sister Lisette. According to Cam, Lisette\u2019s husband had been turned, but had hidden it from her until the insanity had kicked in. Then he had attacked her and transformed her against her will. Etienne and Richart had slain her husband and offered her their blood in an attempt to hide her condition from everyone else, not knowing that frequent exposure to the virus through bites would infect them as well. So for two hundred years, Lisette had been burdened with the knowledge that she had accidentally transformed her brothers.</p><p>And Etienne had never once held it against her, insisting he would have done nothing different had they known beforehand what it would cost him. Richart, too.</p><p>So Sean supposed they did have that in common. He would give his life to save Krysta. Etienne would give his life to save Lisette . . . and Krysta, which made it damned hard for Sean to continue resisting her involvement with the immortal.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Cam said, drawing a set of keys from his back pocket and heading for the door. \u201cWe\u2019re out. Call me if you need me.\u201d</p><p>Etienne nodded.</p><p>Krysta waved with a smile.</p><p>The trip to the network took about forty-five minutes. Etienne lived way out in the boonies, distanced from towns and neighbors alike.</p> <p>Sean studied the exterior of the building as Cam pulled into the parking lot occupied by more vehicles than Sean would\u2019ve expected to see at this hour.</p><p>It was a little anticlimactic. Krysta had mentioned several times the power Chris Reordon, the leader of the East Coast division of the network, wielded. Sean would\u2019ve thought the place would look a little more . . . remarkable.</p><p>Cam laughed as he shut off the engine and opened his door. \u201cI know. Bland as hell, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Sean exited the car.</p><p>\u201cThat was deliberate. Chris wanted something that wouldn\u2019t interest anyone who happened upon it because they took a wrong turn.\u201d</p><p>Then he had succeeded. Surrounded by thick evergreens on all sides, it had been built far from strip malls, business districts, and residential neighborhoods. The one-story concrete structure looked aged and worn and reminded him of a storage facility for a package delivery service.</p><p>\u201cIs this the front or the back?\u201d he asked as he followed Cam to a plain wooden door.</p><p>\u201cBack. There really isn\u2019t much of a difference, though.\u201d</p><p>The plain wooden door wasn\u2019t so plain, Cam soon discovered. The inside was lined with steel and was as thick and heavy as the door of a bank vault. As Cam closed the door behind them, Sean found himself in a glass vestibule with a locked door and a view of a lobby.</p><p>Sean gave the glass an experimental rap with his knuckles. \u201cI\u2019m going to go out on a limb and guess this is bulletproof glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe glass in the previous network headquarters building was bulletproof. This stuff will stop a fucking missile.\u201d</p><p>The lobby was a modern collection of grays that comprised a U-shaped arrangement of comfortable-looking chairs. Large Peace Lilies on side tables injected what otherwise would have been a somewhat cold room with warmth and color.</p><p>Half a dozen guards manned a granite-topped security desk opposite the locked door. A good twenty more stood sentry beside elevators behind the desk. Rather than wearing traditional security guard uniforms, they all bore the standard black hunting garb of a Second.</p><p>And they were very heavily armed.</p><p>Cam waited while one of the guards at the desk rose and approached the door. He then held up an ID card.</p><p>\u201cHey, Cam,\u201d the guard said, withdrawing some kind of laser scanner from a pocket on his belt.</p><p>\u201cJohn. How\u2019s the evening been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice and quiet.\u201d He scanned the card through the glass, then tucked away the scanner. \u201cClear,\u201d he said over his shoulder.</p><p>A buzz sounded.</p><p>Cam grabbed the door handle and opened the door.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s your friend? Chris said you\u2019d be bringing a visitor, but didn\u2019t go into detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Sean Linz. Sean, John Wendleck.\u201d</p><p>They shook hands.</p><p>Sean followed Cam and John toward the elevators.</p><p>\u201cSean and his sister Krysta are vampire hunters,\u201d Cam mentioned.</p><p>John tilted his head to one side. \u201cDon\u2019t we all pretty much qualify as vampire hunters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but they\u2019ve been doing it on their own with no knowledge of our existence for the past six years. And by doing it on their own, I mean actively seeking out vampires, luring them into traps, and killing them.\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s eyebrows flew up. \u201cYou\u2019ve been hunting vampires on your own? Damn. That\u2019s ballsy.\u201d</p><p>Several of the other guards nodded their agreement as the trio circled the desk.</p><p>A pair of elevator doors opened.</p><p>John reclaimed his seat behind the desk.</p><p>Sean stepped inside the elevator with Cam and looked around. \u201cThis is a one-story building. What\u2019s the point of the elevator?\u201d</p><p>Cam leaned forward and pressed a button marked S5. \u201cThere are five floors underground. We\u2019re going down to the fifth, the sublevel with the tightest security.\u201d</p><p>The doors slid closed.</p><p>\u201cWhy the tightest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires live there.\u201d</p><p>Sean stared at him. \u201cCome again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Lipton\u2019s office is on S5. Her lab is, too. She does all of her work down there and part of that includes working with two vampires who surrendered to the immortals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re vampires, why didn\u2019t the immortals just kill them?\u201d Sean demanded. What the hell? Vampires were the enemy. They were monsters.</p><p>\u201cFirst, you might want to watch what you say because the vampires can hear you,\u201d Cam cautioned. \u201cSecond, the madness hasn\u2019t taken them yet. They\u2019re good guys in a messed up situation and have asked for our help. Dr. Lipton is trying to do that. She\u2019s trying to find a cure or at least to find a way to prevent or slow the brain damage they suffer as the virus progresses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying vampires run around freely down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d</p><p>A bell dinged. The doors slid open.</p><p>Sean\u2019s heart stopped.</p><p>Two vampires\u2014one African American and one White\u2014stood there, eyes glowing, fangs gleaming as their lips drew back into snarls.</p><p>\u201cWe do now,\u201d the African-American vamp growled.</p><p>Fear shot through Sean. He hadn\u2019t been allowed to bring any damned weapons!</p><p>The vampire threw back his head. \u201cBwah-ha-ha-ha-ha!\u201d</p><p>The White vampire howled.</p><p>A tall, menacing figure garbed all in black suddenly appeared behind the vamps and popped them both on the back of the head.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d they cried, grabbing their heads.</p><p>\u201cCut the crap,\u201d the immortal ordered.</p><p>Sean recognized him from the meeting, but couldn\u2019t remember his name.</p><p>\u201cAw, come on, Bastien,\u201d the African-American vampire complained. \u201cWe were just razzing the new guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky the new guy isn\u2019t carrying. Get back to the lab.\u201d</p><p>The White vampire grumbled something and dashed away. The other vampire grinned at Sean and shrugged. \u201cThings were getting boring around here. No hard feelings?\u201d</p><p>Before Sean could answer, he, too, darted away.</p><p>Sean stepped off the elevator with Cam. Just outside, a dozen men stood at the ready, faces tense, fingers on the triggers of their automatic weapons.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Bastien told Sean. \u201cThose two are harmless.\u201d</p><p>Sean tilted his head in the direction of the guards. \u201cIf the vampires are harmless, why are these guys so tense?\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cThey aren\u2019t worried about the vampires. They\u2019re worried about me.\u201d He blurred, zipping down the hallway after the vamps.</p><p>Cam cleared his throat. \u201cWould you like to meet Dr. Lipton now?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUm. Okay. Sure.\u201d</p><p>This shit was weird.</p><p>More guards lined the hallway.</p> <p>They nodded as Cam and Sean passed, boots clomping on the industrial-grade linoleum floor.</p><p>\u201cIs security always this tight?\u201d Sean marveled.</p><p>\u201cOnly when Bastien visits.\u201d</p><p>A sardonic laugh floated through an open doorway coming up on their right.</p><p>Cam led the way inside what ended up being a large lab with every kind of medical testing equipment a doctor could wish for. The vampire practical jokers appeared to be doing everything they could to burn out the motors on two treadmills placed side by side. A brunet in a lab coat leaned over a desk, writing something in a file while Bastien lounged in a chair nearby, admiring her.</p> <p>\u201cDr. Lipton?\u201d Cam said.</p><p>Straightening, she turned around. Her furrowed brow cleared as her face brightened with a smile. \u201cHi, Cam.\u201d Setting her pen down, she crossed to them and offered Sean her hand. \u201cWe weren\u2019t formally introduced last night. I\u2019m Melanie. You\u2019re Sean, right?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and shook her hand. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo nice to meet you.\u201d She motioned to the vampires. \u201cThose two are Cliff and Stuart. Cliff\u2019s on the left,\u201d she said, indicating the grinning African American. \u201cStuart\u2019s on the right.\u201d Both vampires\u2019 legs moved so quickly that they blurred, while their upper bodies remained almost stationary. It was a bizarre effect. \u201cAnd this is my husband Bastien,\u201d she finished.</p><p>Sean nodded to Bastien and offered his hand. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Face darkening, Bastien rose. \u201cWhat\u2014are you fucking with me?\u201d</p> <p>Melanie\u2019s eyes widened. Reaching out, she patted Bastien\u2019s arm. \u201cNo, honey. I think he hasn\u2019t heard the rumors yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat rumors?\u201d Sean asked, wondering what was going on.</p><p>Bastien\u2019s face cleared. \u201cOh. Well. Good to meet you, too.\u201d He belatedly shook Sean\u2019s hand.</p><p>Cam rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m out. Sean, you have my number. Call me when you\u2019re ready to leave and I\u2019ll come pick you up.\u201d</p><p>Sean thanked him, even though the fact that he couldn\u2019t come and go as he pleased grated. He had no idea what the network had done with his car, but he wasn\u2019t allowed to use it anymore because it could be traced. When he had suggested borrowing or renting a car, Chris had rejected the idea, saying, \u201cI know it\u2019s an annoyance, but until we get to the bottom of this latest mercenary threat, we need to restrict your movements and ensure you have a guard with you at all times. It\u2019s for both your safety and ours.\u201d</p><p>Annoyance didn\u2019t quite cover it.</p><p>Cam left.</p><p>Sean looked at the vampires. \u201cWhat exactly will this tell you? Are you testing their endurance?\u201d he asked, curious to know what such activity would indicate.</p> <p>Melanie snorted. \u201cNo. They\u2019re just fooling around. Cliff bet Stuart he could go faster on a treadmill.\u201d</p><p>The vampires grinned.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Bastien smiled. \u201cThey aren\u2019t allowed to leave the premises, so things can get pretty boring around here for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re really vampires and not immortals just messing with me?\u201d Sean asked. The pair didn\u2019t seem at all crazy.</p><p>Bastien shook his head. \u201cThey\u2019re vampires. And, since you\u2019ll hear it sooner or later . . .\u201d</p><p>Melanie shook her head violently and repeatedly drew her hand across her throat in a slicing motion. When she noticed Sean watching her, she smiled and pretended she was scratching her neck.</p><p>\u201cUntil a couple of years ago,\u201d Bastien continued, \u201cI thought I was a vampire myself, raised an army of a hundred or so vampires, and waged war with the Immortal Guardians, intending to kill every last one of them.\u201d</p><p>Sean stared at him. No wonder the other immortals had seemed rather hostile toward Bastien at the meeting.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Bastien,\u201d Melanie complained. \u201cWe could have finally had someone on our side, but, nooooo. You had to go and open your mouth.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMay as well be honest. It sounds a lot less damaging coming from me.\u201d He looked at Sean again. \u201cOh, and I once killed an immortal.\u201d</p><p>Melanie hit him on the arm. \u201cStop talking!\u201d</p><p>Sean laughed. As did the vampires.</p><p>She smiled sheepishly. \u201cSorry. He really is a good guy. But I\u2019m having trouble convincing the others of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you won\u2019t be getting any grief from me,\u201d Sean assured her. When Bastien looked doubtful, Sean shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m new to this world and not invested in its past. As long as you don\u2019t screw with me or my sister, I\u2019m fine with you.\u201d</p><p>Bastien raised his eyebrows. \u201cI think I like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGay!\u201d Stuart called breathlessly. A loud clunk sounded as the motor of his treadmill let out a burst of smoke and stopped turning. Still running at top speed, Stuart slammed into the front of the treadmill, bounced off, and hit the wall behind him hard enough to crack the Sheetrock.</p><p>Cliff burst into laughter and slowed to a halt.</p><p>Melanie sighed. \u201cI told you not to break anything!\u201d</p><p>Stuart groaned and picked himself up off the floor, staggering a little. \u201cLaugh it up, asswipe,\u201d he told Cliff. \u201cI won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, I totally let you win because I knew that would happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. It happened to me the first time Dr. Lipton put me on a treadmill.\u201d</p><p>Melanie winced. \u201cI still feel bad about that.\u201d</p><p>Cliff didn\u2019t seem to hold it against her.</p><p>Bastien smiled. \u201cCliff was a member of my army. Stuart is a new recruit.\u201d</p><p>This was not at all what Sean had expected.</p><p>Melanie smiled. \u201cYou look a little shell-shocked.\u201d</p><p>He watched Cliff taunt Stuart while Stuart brushed the dust off his clothes and shook it out of his hair. \u201cI\u2019ve never encountered sane vampires before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hopefully our research will pay off and the era of psychotic vampires will end soon,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to hear about the work you\u2019re doing. I\u2019m a medical student at Duke and Chris mentioned recruiting me. He said, if I did, we\u2019d be working together and you\u2019d mentor me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAre you considering it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent!\u201d Grinning, she started toward him.</p><p>Bastien scowled. \u201cHug him and I\u2019ll have to kill him.\u201d</p><p>She stopped and blew him a raspberry. \u201cSpoilsport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA jealous spoilsport.\u201d Bastien drew her into his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to hunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Do you have the antidote on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She bussed his lips. \u201cBe safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d He claimed her lips in a kiss that lingered. \u201cI almost forgot. I have a surprise for you.\u201d Crossing to a coat stand just inside the door, he removed a long, black coat. The interior was lined with as many weapons as Etienne\u2019s was.</p><p>Delving into an outer pocket, Bastien returned to Melanie and held out several small packages.</p><p>Melanie took one and turned it over. \u201cNo way! Organic chocolate turtles?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and smiled.</p><p>Whooping with excitement, she jumped up and wrapped her arms around his neck and her legs around his waist for a tight hug.</p><p>Bastien laughed and hugged her back.</p><p>As soon as she dropped her feet to the floor, she tore into the first package and popped the whole candy into her mouth. Her eyes closed in ecstasy. \u201cOh man,\u201d she said around a mouthful of chocolate. \u201cThis is so good.\u201d</p><p>Sean raised his eyebrows.</p><p>Meeting his gaze, she covered her mouth and laughed.</p><p>Bastien shook his head with a smile and crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p>She chewed and swallowed. \u201cI haven\u2019t been immortal that long and had to give up all of my favorite foods, so I\u2019ve been craving them like crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you have to give up all of your favorite foods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause none of them were organic. Our stupid sense of taste is just as heightened as our vision and our sense of smell. And, trust me when I say, foods that contain artificial flavoring and other synthetic chemicals do not taste the same as the real deal. As Bastien once warned me, vanilla and synthetic vanillin taste as different to us as turkey and tofurky do to you.\u201d She stuffed another chocolate turtle in her mouth and endeavored to speak around it. \u201cBastien\u2019s been looking for organic alternatives to some of my favorites and I love turtles.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Bastien cupped her face in his hands and kissed her. \u201cYou are too adorable.\u201d He kissed her again, longer and deeper. \u201cYou taste good, too.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flushed as he released her.</p><p>Bastien nodded at Sean. \u201cHave fun.\u201d He pointed to the vampires. \u201cYou two . . . behave. And leave Melanie\u2019s candy alone. She can kick your ass without a thought now.\u201d</p><p>Cliff and Stuart clicked their heels together and saluted.</p><p>Shaking his head, Bastien left.</p><p>Melanie wadded up the empty packages and tossed them into a wastebasket on the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Sean praised with a smile.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I imagine you have some questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout a hundred of them.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she motioned to a couple of chairs over by a desk. \u201cWhat would you like to know first?\u201d</p><p>He waited for her to sit, then seated himself beside her. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve always wanted to know why I can heal with my hands.\u201d</p><p>She dropped the rest of the candy packages on the desk and leaned forward, her face lighting with interest. \u201cYou can heal with your hands?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful. Two gifted ones who are descendants of a powerful healer just came to our attention recently, but neither can heal with their hands.\u201d</p><p>Cliff dragged a chair over to join them. \u201cSo, you can just lay hands on a wound and heal it?\u201d He sat down. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool. I wish I could do that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stuart nodded as he pulled up another chair. \u201cMe, too.\u201d Seating himself, he surreptitiously reached toward the candy on the desk.</p><p>\u201cTouch it and die,\u201d Melanie warned without looking at him.</p><p>He snatched his hand back.</p> <p>\u201cNow,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can heal with your hands because your DNA is very unique. Every human has forty-six DNA memo groups that provide the blueprint for his or her existence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cGifted ones have seven thousand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d Stuart said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that means.\u201d</p><p>Sean wasn\u2019t sure he did either. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cWe aren\u2019t sure.\u201d</p><p>Fascinated by the information he proceeded to acquire, Sean spent the next several hours alone in a room, conversing with a beautiful immortal and two curious, genial vampires with a fondness for practical jokes.</p><p>It was the strangest night of his life.</p><p>Etienne smiled faintly. He and Krysta sat on the edge of Davis Library\u2019s roof at UNC Chapel Hill. It had taken some coaxing to get her to do it, and then to relax. Like many humans, she had a fear of heights.</p><p>It isn\u2019t so much a fear of heights, she had said, as a fear of plunging to my death.</p><p>I won\u2019t let you fall, he had vowed.</p> <p>It meant a great deal to him that she had believed him, sitting down, then shakily scooting to the edge and dangling her legs over the side.</p><p>Tranquility embraced them, broken by a dog bark here, a cat yowl there, or the occasional vehicle passing on the street.</p><p>They had been hunting and training together for almost two weeks now while Sean studied with Dr. Lipton. Etienne had not enjoyed anything so much in decades.</p><p>Moments like this were his favorites.</p><p>Her shoulder pressed against his arm. Her scent enveloped him, mingling with the chicken sandwiches Cam had made them. Her mere presence provided a balm he hadn\u2019t realized he had needed. Calming. Comforting. Dispelling the emptiness inside him.</p><p>\u201cI love hunting with you,\u201d she said, reaching for the bottle of tea on her other side.</p><p>His pulse leapt.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t eaten this much or this well since I lived with my parents,\u201d she continued with a wry smile.</p> <p>He laughed. For a moment, he had thought\u2014</p><p>Her eyes widened as alarm rippled across her moonlit features. \u201cOh, crap. My parents!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if the mercenaries go after them to get to me. Or to get to you through me?\u201d</p><p>He waved a hand. \u201cChris took care of that when you and Sean moved in with me. Your parents are heavily guarded at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Frowning, she took another bite and chewed it thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019m surprised they haven\u2019t called. What did they say about it? I haven\u2019t talked to them in almost three weeks. Mom has a knack for sensing when something is wrong and I didn\u2019t know what to say to her when she asked what was up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know about the network guards. Chris\u2019s men are in stealth mode.\u201d</p><p>She took another bite.</p><p>He liked that she had a strong appetite. He didn\u2019t know why he enjoyed watching her eat so much, but he did. Perhaps because he knew she and Sean had had some lean times.</p><p>\u201cNo one has approached my parents? No mercenaries? No suspicious characters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a good thing or a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know. None of us have encountered any mercenaries since they hit your house. We don\u2019t know if that means they\u2019re regrouping, or have given up, or what. We don\u2019t know who these mercenaries are, how large their PMC is, who leads them . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a PMC?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivate Military Company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re a small group, perhaps we did enough damage to make them rethink things. If they aren\u2019t, they\u2019re probably plotting something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>More quiet, comfortable, soothing.</p><p>\u201cThis sandwich is really good.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m glad you like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are definite perks to hunting with you.\u201d</p><p>And there were perks to hunting with her. Like spending hours and hours together every night. Getting to brush up against her and steal kisses and\u2014</p><p>Think about something else. Something guaranteed to keep you from getting turned on. \u201cYour parents,\u201d he blurted.</p><p>Raising her eyebrows, she finished the last bite and tucked the empty tea bottle into their dinner bag. \u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one of them is a gifted one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d That was pretty rare in this century. \u201cThat must be why your gifts and your brother\u2019s are stronger than that of other gifted ones in your generation.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cMy mom can feel other people\u2019s emotions and my dad can sometimes see the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastien can feel other people\u2019s emotions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe immortal everyone hates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean likes him.\u201d</p><p>Etienne sighed. \u201cBastien has his moments.\u201d</p><p>Several minutes passed.</p><p>Krysta looked at her watch. \u201cWe still have a few hours of hunting left and nothing much is happening. You want to make out a little?\u201d</p><p>He laughed in surprised delight. \u201cYou\u2019re a saucy wench, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, when I want something, I go for it.\u201d</p><p>His body hardened. \u201cAnd you want me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She studied him intently. \u201cYour eyes are glowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you, too.\u201d</p><p>A breeze ruffled her hair, bringing with it the scent of blood.</p><p>He swore. \u201cBut, yet again, it looks like it\u2019s time to go to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires, heading this way from the north.\u201d</p><p>He stood, brushed the crumbs from his lap, then held his hand out to her.</p><p>She curled her small fingers around his and stood, hastily moving away from the roof\u2019s edge. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He brought her hand to his lips for a kiss.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou are so hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t distract me, minx.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cAre we going to do this your way or my way?\u201d</p><p>They had alternated between using Krysta as bait and hunting Etienne-style, which pretty much just entailed patrolling this campus or that and pouncing on any vampires they found.</p><p>Both got the job done. Unfortunately, neither reduced the danger to Krysta. No matter how many vamps they fought or how the battles began, she ended up wounded and in need of her brother\u2019s healing hands. Both siblings seemed pleased, insisting she suffered far fewer wounds when she fought with Etienne. But it frustrated him that he couldn\u2019t prevent the injuries entirely.</p><p>Etienne breathed deeply, collecting and sorting through the scents riding the wind. Tilting his head slightly, he caught snippets of conversation.</p><p>\u201cThere could be as many as a dozen. Three are fresh from a kill and boasting of it to the others.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThey relished every scream they elicited from their victim. Those three are beyond help. The others aren\u2019t as vocal, so we\u2019ll have to see if any are salvable enough to be swayed to our side.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cIt seems so useless, asking them to join us. Not one we\u2019ve encountered so far has responded with anything other than disbelief and psychotic rage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But Seth and David want us to keep trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt still feels weird to take orders from someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it,\u201d he said. They all had. And it helped that the ones giving the orders were exceedingly wise and fair.</p><p>He refocused on the smells and sounds of the vampire troupe. \u201cWith numbers that large, herding them into an alley might be tricky, restricting our movements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this my way and just confront them head-on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill that give you enough time to read their minds and gauge their levels of madness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as much as using you as bait would. But I want you by my side when the battle begins so I can watch your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t endanger yourself by trying to keep an eye on me constantly, okay? I don\u2019t want you to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>He refused to make that promise. Think your thoughts to me from this point on. They\u2019re getting close enough to hear us.</p><p>Okay. And don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice that you failed to agree.</p><p>I said you could hunt with me. I didn\u2019t say you could tell me what to do or that I wouldn\u2019t watch over you in battle. He scooped her up into his arms.</p><p>Stubborn.</p><p>And you aren\u2019t?</p><p>She looped her arms around his neck.</p><p>Ready?</p><p>She nodded. As I\u2019ll ever be.</p><p>Bending his head, he touched his lips to hers. Hold on tight. Etienne stepped off the roof.</p><p>Her silky hair whipped his face as they dropped eight stories. He landed smoothly on the balls of his feet, the impact pulling her lips from his.</p><p>That is so cool.</p><p>Smiling, he lowered her feet to the grass. Fun, too. I admit, when I was younger, I went through a phase in which I repeatedly tested the limits of my abilities by jumping off higher and higher buildings.</p><p>She stepped back. What happened?</p><p>I found out it isn\u2019t fun to reach one\u2019s limits. He had broken a lot of bones that night. And that doing stupid shit pisses Seth off.</p><p>She smiled.</p><p>Silently, they wound their way up sidewalks and between buildings. Etienne used his senses to estimate the vampires\u2019 route, then decided to confront them where Bastien had once ended a bloody rampage: in the narrow parking alley\u2014empty this time of night\u2014between Peabody and Sitterson Hall.</p><p>Here they come, he warned.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Krysta stood beside Etienne, nerves jumping. Anything more from their thoughts?</p><p>I think some of the group are fairly recently transformed. They\u2019re uncomfortable with the bloody trio\u2019s boasts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>You mean we might actually recruit some vampires tonight?

Why?</p><p>Because I had an intriguingly racy dream about you this morning and have been distracted picturing you naked and imagining your hands on me ever since.</p><p>His eyes flashed amber.</p> <p>Her pulse picked up. Were you there? As you, I mean? You said you could do that.</p><p>Unfortunately, no.</p><p>Disappointing. She had been sleeping in Lisette\u2019s room each night, but that dream had almost driven her to cross the hall. Well, I only thought it fair that you share a little of the pain.</p><p>He lowered his gaze to her lips. So you were serious when you suggested we make out on the roof?</p><p>Pretty much.</p><p>You do realize I\u2019m now going to have to fight the vampires with a raging erection, right?</p> <p>Her gaze dropped to his groin. Wow. He wasn\u2019t kidding.</p><p>No, I wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Oops. She must have been broadcasting again. I thought you guys had tremendous control over your bodies. Can\u2019t you just . . . think it away? What a waste. Damned vampires.</p><p>Lips twitching, he closed his eyes. I\u2019ll try.</p><p>Since his eyes were closed, she didn\u2019t bother to avert her own. That was quite a bulge. Even more impressive than the one he had sported in her dream as he had torn off her shirt and tongued her breasts.</p><p>Damn it! Close your mind to me!</p><p>Oh. Sorry. What was the opposite of sexy and seductive? What was so not sexy that, if she pictured it, it would be the equivalent of a bucket of ice water dousing him?</p><p>Hmm. Sean\u2019s nasty-ass meat loaf might do it.</p> <p>Or the girl from The Exorcist projectile vomiting.</p><p>A skinny, saggy, one-hundred-year-old man dancing around naked.</p><p>He grimaced. Where the hell did you see a one-hundred-year-old man naked?</p><p>In a movie I really wish I hadn\u2019t watched.</p><p>Well, thank you. I guess. It worked.</p><p>She grinned.</p><p>What the hell was the brown and green lump you showed me first?</p><p>Sean\u2019s meat loaf.</p><p>He shuddered. Okay, sober up. They\u2019re about to come around the corner.</p><p>She could hear the vampires herself now. They weren\u2019t exactly trying to keep their movements or boasts unobtrusive. As Etienne had said, three of the vamps seemed to be doing most of the talking.</p><p>The group strutted into view.</p><p>Krysta did a quick head count and came up with eleven.</p><p>They halted at the sight of her and Etienne.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d Etienne greeted them.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well,\u201d one vampire said, his glowing blue eyes fastening on Krysta. Blood soaked his shirt and pants down to the knees.</p><p>What the hell had he done to his victim?</p><p>Another stepped up beside him, a sleazy smile shaping his thin lips. \u201cLooks like tonight\u2019s fun isn\u2019t over.\u201d</p><p>Etienne snapped his fingers. \u201cOver here, gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>They frowned at him.</p><p>\u201cApparently it has escaped your notice that I\u2019m an Immortal Guardian.\u201d</p><p>The eyes of all the vampires lit like lamps, glowing in varying shades of blue and green and amber. Almost as one, they drew weapons. Mostly bowie knives and machetes.</p><p>Krysta drew her shoto swords.</p><p>Etienne\u2019s weapons remained sheathed. \u201cI have a proposition for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a proposition for you, too,\u201d one of the other vamps sneered. \u201cI propose we kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d another said. \u201cAn Immortal Guardian killed Mac and Keith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Eddie.\u201d</p><p>Etienne shrugged. \u201cI suppose it could have been me, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFu\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA new enemy has arisen. One that poses a threat to both vampires and immortals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorseshit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumans are hunting us,\u201d Etienne continued, unperturbed by the swears and slurs and shifting movements of the vamps. \u201cMore specifically, mercenaries are hunting us. They want to catch one of us, dissect us, and use the virus for economic gain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I say we hand you over to them,\u201d the first vampire jeered.</p><p>\u201cThat would be monumentally stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stupid!\u201d a vamp in the back shouted.</p><p>\u201cGreat comeback,\u201d Krysta muttered.</p><p>They turned their attention to her.</p><p>\u201cAh-ah-ah,\u201d Etienne reprimanded. \u201cOver here.\u201d</p><p>They looked to him once more.</p><p>\u201cAs I was saying, turning me over to the mercenaries would be monumentally stupid. Whatever they learn about the virus and our physiology from dissecting me could be used against you. And vice versa. Which, by the way, is the only reason any of you are still standing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still standing because we outnumber you, jackwad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m two hundred years older than you. Two hundred years stronger than you. Were your numbers twice what they are now, I could still defeat you.\u201d</p><p>Really? Krysta asked mentally. That was damned impressive.</p><p>No. I\u2019m bluffing. One of the elder immortals could, though.</p><p>More curses and denials and posturing. The blood-covered vamps and a few of the others were getting pretty amped up.</p><p>Krysta tightened her grip on the shoto swords, watching their auras carefully for any hint of impending attack.</p><p>\u201cThough they\u2019re human,\u201d Etienne stubbornly persevered, \u201cthe mercenaries pose a serious threat. They\u2019ve developed a new weapon to use against us. A tranquilizer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrugs don\u2019t work on us,\u201d a vamp snorted.</p><p>\u201cThis one does. It takes several darts to incapacitate an immortal. But a single dart will drop one of you in your tracks instantly and land you on the dissection table.\u201d</p><p>Krysta nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the darts in action. He isn\u2019t bullshitting you. These guys could take out every one of you without even getting near you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just fucking with us!\u201d a bloody vamp snapped.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not,\u201d Etienne said, never raising his voice. \u201cWe\u2019re proposing an alliance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires working with immortals?\u201d another scoffed. \u201cMy ass!\u201d</p><p>Etienne raised an eyebrow. \u201cYour ass will be tortured if you\u2019re caught. I suggest you work with us and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck this shit! Fuck him up!\u201d the vamp with the saturated shirt shouted.</p><p>His orange aura shot toward Etienne a second before the vamp did. Half a dozen more did the same. The others darted toward Krysta.</p><p>She swung her swords, striking flesh as they closed in on her. Two fell back with howls of rage and pain. Then a third.</p><p>A blade cut across her hamstring.</p><p>Hissing in pain, she spun and sliced.</p><p>The vamp behind her bent forward, clutching his middle.</p><p>Yelps and hisses and gurgles of pain filled the night as Etienne tore into his opponents and Krysta continued to hold her own.</p><p>The tip of a blade pierced her side.</p><p>Gritting her teeth, Krysta swiveled and stabbed the vamp attacking on her left.</p><p>Pain exploded in her head.</p><p>She staggered. Shit! A vamp must have punched her. Her knees weakened as little sparkly bits of glitter flirted with her vision.</p><p>Brilliant purple and white swept in a circle around her, laying out all of the vampires swarming around her as he had once before.</p><p>Etienne paused in front of her, his face close to hers. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>A vamp came at his back.</p><p>\u201cBehind you!\u201d</p><p>He spun around, swinging his sword, and swept the vampire\u2019s head from his body.</p><p>The vampire beside him gaped and lowered his weapon, wide eyes latching onto Etienne. \u201cOh, shit!\u201d He took a step back, then jerked and danced as holes opened in his chest and blood sprayed.</p><p>Two more vampires fell, their torsos peppered with bullets.</p><p>Krysta jerked as a bullet pierced her shoulder. Another filled her arm with fire.</p><p>Her hand went numb. Her sword fell to the ground.</p><p>Swearing, Etienne dropped a katana and swept Krysta behind him, holding her there with one arm as he backed up against the nearest wall.</p><p>A dart pierced a vampire\u2019s neck. He collapsed to the ground, unconscious. Another vamp fell to a dart.</p><p>The remaining vampires froze, then raced for the opposite building, flattening themselves against the wall. There were only . . . five vampires left, those not killed by mercenaries having been taken out by Etienne or Krysta.</p><p>A vampire directly across from them stared at Etienne with wide eyes. \u201cThat shit was true?\u201d he cried, voice high with fear. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p><p>The others all waited in fearful silence.</p><p>Krysta, call Cam. Don\u2019t use names. The mercenaries may be listening.</p><p>She sheathed her other shoto sword and yanked out her cell phone. As soon as he answered, she whispered, \u201cMercenaries are attacking us!\u201d</p><p>While she gave their location, Etienne ordered two vamps to cross the alley and join them.</p><p>They must have been too afraid to do anything but obey, because they only hesitated a second before they streaked across and hit the wall beside them.</p><p>A flurry of bullets whizzed past, missing them and ricocheting off the pavement with little sprays of asphalt and dirt.</p><p>\u201cProtect the woman,\u201d Etienne commanded.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d Krysta demanded shrilly, stuffing the phone back in her pocket.</p><p>I\u2019m going to sweep around and come up behind the soldiers , he said.</p><p>You can\u2019t take them out alone!</p><p>I don\u2019t intend to.</p><p>Before Krysta could ask him what he meant, he continued. The mercenaries are on foot.</p><p>The vamps all gasped and gaped at Etienne.</p><p>Was he talking to them telepathically, too?</p><p>\u201cDude,\u201d the vampire beside her said, \u201chow\u2019d you do that?\u201d A former Tar Heel hunting his old stomping grounds, according to his T-shirt.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t matter. As I said, the mercenaries are on foot and are closing in on us. The bulk of the group will strike from the east. The rest plan to circle around and attack us from the west, essentially boxing us in here. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s just run,\u201d the second vamp hissed.</p><p>Let them live now and they will find you another night.</p><p>All of them swore.</p> <p>Decide quickly, gentlemen, and don\u2019t say anything that will indicate your impending actions. They\u2019re listening.</p><p>The Tar Heel looked at his fellows and nodded.</p><p>One by one they all nodded back.</p><p>He turned to Etienne and gave him a thumbs-up.</p><p>Smart man. You stay here with AndrE the Giant, he said, indicating the huge, hulking vamp on the Tar Heel\u2019s other side, and guard the woman.</p> <p>I can\u2019t believe this shit, Krysta muttered to him.</p><p>Etienne glanced at her from the corner of his eye. I\u2019ve read their thoughts. Any intention they had of harming you is gone. He nodded to the three vamps across the alley. I\u2019m going to meet the larger group head-on. You three meet those who are circling around to the south. Keep moving. They can\u2019t tranq or shoot what they can\u2019t see. Stay between them if you can and maybe you\u2019ll luck out and trick them into killing each other. Go. Now.</p><p>Etienne blurred and shot away.</p><p>When the three vamps hesitated, Tar Heel scowled and indicated with a furious wave that they should get their asses moving.</p><p>They blurred and shot away, too.</p><p>Krysta, drew the tranquilizer gun Etienne had insisted she carry. One dose, he had told her, would either kill a human or sedate a vamp.</p> <p>She eyed the vamps nervously.</p><p>They shifted from foot to foot, hands clenching and unclenching on their weapons, gazes shifting back and forth from one end of the alley to the other.</p><p>Etienne had better be right about them.</p><p>Until he had met Krysta, Etienne had not felt real fear in . . . almost two centuries. He had had some scary moments in the first years following his transformation, but nothing like this.</p><p>Krysta was wounded and bleeding and he had just entrusted her care to two vampires. He continued to monitor those vampires\u2019 thoughts. But, if they changed their mind and either attacked her or left her to fend for herself, he may not be able to get back to her in time to save her.</p><p>The notion terrified him.</p><p>Sticking to the shadows, Etienne headed first for the building from which he knew a mercenary was playing sniper and guiding the others. He leapt up to the roof, not bothering to soften his landing.</p><p>The mercenary swung around. Eyes wide, he raised a tranquilizer gun. This was probably the bastard who had shot Krysta.</p> <p>Etienne closed the distance between them and knocked the gun aside before the man could squeeze the trigger.</p><p>Wrapping one hand around the man\u2019s throat and lifting him onto his toes, Etienne drew a tranquilizer dart\u2014one with a human dose\u2014from one of his pockets. \u201cYou wanted me,\u201d he growled as the man fought his hold. \u201cYou got me.\u201d</p><p>He shoved the dart into the man\u2019s throat. The soldier had just enough time to realize what had happened and wet himself before he passed out.</p><p>Etienne dropped him and drew out his cell phone as he stepped off the roof.</p><p>\u201cOui?\u201d Richart answered.</p><p>Etienne landed nimbly on the ground. \u201cMercenaries are attacking us at UNC,\u201d he said, whisper soft. \u201cMeet me at the northeast corner of Chapman Hall.\u201d</p><p>Richart appeared a few feet away.</p><p>Etienne pocketed his phone and swiftly filled his brother in telepathically.</p><p>Drawing his weapons, Richart stared at him as they headed toward the larger group of mercenaries and came up behind them. You left two vampires guarding Krysta? Are you out of your fucking mind?</p><p>I hope not.</p><p>The mercenaries approached the entrance to the alley. Had they not all been edging forward with caution, they would have already reached it.</p><p>While Etienne dashed toward their front, blocking their entrance, Richart teleported directly into the middle of the group.</p><p>Etienne grinned as chaos erupted.</p><p>On the other side of Sitterson Hall, screams of pain split the night as the vampires went to work on the other group of mercenaries.</p><p>Etienne tore into the soldiers, trying to read the minds of those he killed or wounded. Most were so full of fear and hatred\u2014almost as much hatred as he encountered in a vampire\u2019s mind\u2014that he couldn\u2019t discern their leader\u2019s name or the name of their PMC.</p><p>Bullets and tranquilizer darts flew in every direction. When one hit Etienne, he administered the antidote without missing a beat. The soldiers began to panic as their numbers dwindled and started taking out each other with friendly fire as they swung their weapons in wide arcs, trying to hit anything that moved.</p><p>Etienne lost count of the mercenaries they fought and wondered how the hell Chris would clean up something this big on a college campus. They were damned lucky it was often deserted this late.</p><p>Three mercenaries broke for the alley.</p><p>Etienne started after them, then stopped and resumed fighting when he heard Krysta fire her tranquilizer gun.</p><p>He heard one of the three vamps he had sent after the other contingent fall to a tranquilizer dart. The other two started to freak out and considered bolting.</p><p>Hold it together, he ordered sternly, remembering Tanner\u2014Bastien\u2019s Second\u2014telling them that the vampires Bastien had led had all feared him. Fall back into the alley so the others can help you, but do not let any of the soldiers harm the woman. Fail me in this or flee the battle and I will torture you myself when I hunt you down.</p><p>He was actually a bit surprised when that snapped them out of it.</p><p>Several bullets slammed into his back.</p><p>Bastards. Etienne spun around and swung a sword at the shooter. No, two shooters.</p><p>Are you leaving any alive? Richart asked dryly.</p><p>Ummm . . .</p><p>Richart laughed.</p><p>Ah, hell. Krysta has run out of darts and is leaping into the fray in the alley.</p><p>Go to her. I have this.</p><p>Another quick head count yielded few enough soldiers left here that Etienne felt comfortable leaving his brother to face them alone. Because of his gift, Richart tended to fare far better than other young immortals when facing large numbers.</p><p>Etienne raced into the alley.</p><p>Half a dozen soldiers fought there.</p><p>All four vampires remained in perpetual motion as they darted in and out and around the men, delivering cuts and gashes and fatal wounds.</p><p>Krysta hung back, a sword in the hand of her uninjured arm, waiting for an opportunity.</p><p>The vamps parted. She darted in and swung, slicing through an arm wielding a tranquilizer gun, then jumped back as one of the vamps circled around again.</p><p>Damned if it didn\u2019t look like they were all working together. Krysta must be wondering if Hell had frozen over.</p><p>The last two soldiers gave up on following orders and trying to bring them down alive. Planting their backs to each other, they opened fire with their silencer-equipped automatic weapons. Once again, panic shot through Etienne.</p><p>Krysta.</p><p>The smaller of the two vamps he had left guarding her tackled her and took her to the ground, covering her body with his. The other three vamps and Etienne were hit with bullets as Etienne rushed forward and cleaved the soldiers\u2019 heads from their bodies.</p><p>Both dropped to the ground.</p><p>Stark silence engulfed them, broken only by the harsh breaths of Etienne and the vampires.</p><p>Richart appeared beside him. The vampire covering Krysta clambered to his feet. Krysta rose and, staring at the vamp in utter disbelief, sidled over to the d\u2019Alen\u00e7ons.</p><p>Four vampires\u2014bleeding from multiple wounds, standing side by side, hands still clutching weapons\u2014faced them.</p><p>The silence stretched as all waited for action.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Krysta said to the one who had taken several bullets for her.</p><p>He nodded once, jaw clenching, hand not loosening its hold on his blade.</p><p>She glanced at Etienne. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he answered honestly. \u201cI\u2019ve never gotten this far before.\u201d Only Bastien had ever successfully recruited vampires.</p><p>Speaking of which . . .</p><p>He sheathed one of his weapons, drew out his phone again, and dialed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bastien answered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Etienne. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but I have a situation and could use your help.\u201d</p><p>Bastien grunted. \u201cI bet that hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Etienne asked, refusing to take the bait.</p><p>\u201cIn Melanie\u2019s office at the network.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichart is on his way.\u201d</p><p>He pocketed his phone and met his brother\u2019s gaze. \u201cHe\u2019s in Melanie\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Richart vanished.</p><p>The vampires gasped.</p><p>\u201cHow does he do that?\u201d the Tar Heel asked. According to his thoughts, his name was Jeremy. He seemed to be the most lucid of the group.</p><p>\u201cStick around and you\u2019ll find out.\u201d Etienne looked at the vamp on the far right, who was considering bolting. \u201cDon\u2019t run. You won\u2019t get far and having to chase you will piss me off.\u201d</p><p>The vampire swallowed.</p><p>\u201cNow, all four of you did me a solid,\u201d he went on, then looked to Krysta. \u201cThat\u2019s a saying, right?\u201d</p><p>Though her pretty face was pinched with pain, she smiled. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He returned his attention to the vamps. \u201cAll of you did me a solid, so you can relax and stop worrying about me attacking you.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy\u2019s shoulders loosened a bit. \u201cWhat about Kenny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one felled by the tranquilizer dart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good with him, too.\u201d Satisfied that the vamps were in line, he carefully pulled Krysta into a hug. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, leaning into him. \u201cDo you think Richart could take me home to Sean while you guys work out whatever it is you\u2019re going to do?\u201d</p><p>He swore. \u201cI should have had him do that first.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI would have missed out on the hug.\u201d</p><p>One of the vamps\u2014Ben, according to his thoughts\u2014leaned toward another and whispered, \u201cIs it me or does this look like it\u2019s about to turn into a chick flick?\u201d</p><p>Krysta laughed, then grunted in pain.</p><p>Etienne put just enough distance between them to peel off her coat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She growled at the agony it caused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I want to make sure you aren\u2019t losing too much blood.\u201d The bullet that had struck her arm had thankfully missed her brachial artery. The wound in her shoulder still bled sluggishly, but didn\u2019t look too bad.</p><p>Draping her coat over her shoulders, he drew her into his arms again.</p> <p>Richart reappeared with Bastien at his side.</p><p>The vamps tensed and eyed the two anxiously.</p><p>Bastien\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned. He wasn\u2019t bullshitting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichart,\u201d Etienne said, \u201cwould you take Krysta to my place so her brother can heal her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>Releasing her, Etienne touched a finger to Krysta\u2019s chin and tilted her head back so he could lower his lips to hers for a soft kiss.</p><p>\u201cChick flick,\u201d Ben whispered in a singsong voice.</p><p>Krysta smiled. \u201cThat one\u2019s a keeper.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Etienne stepped back.</p><p>Richart touched her shoulder and whisked the two away.</p><p>Bastien sighed. \u201cWhen Richart returns, have him take you, too.\u201d</p> <p>Etienne opened his mouth to protest. They had quite a mess to clean up.</p><p>Bastien held up a hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve got this.\u201d He glanced at their vampire audience. \u201cAnd a cleanup crew is on the way to take care of the rest, most likely with Reordon to oversee them. So do it. Everyone here can see that you want to be with her.\u201d He raised his eyebrows at the vamps.</p><p>They nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s totally obvious,\u201d Jeremy said.</p><p>\u201cSo obvious,\u201d Ben agreed.</p><p>Etienne sighed. He really did want to be with her, so he would trust Bastien this time.</p><p>Jeremy shifted. \u201cWho\u2019s the new guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone with whom I thought you might feel more comfortable,\u201d Etienne said. \u201cSebastien Newcombe.\u201d</p> <p>They stared, then exchanged amazed looks.</p><p>\u201cSebastien as in Bastien?\u201d Jeremy asked. \u201cThe Bastien, who raised and led an army of vampires in war against the immortals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Bastien responded. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like to brag.\u201d</p><p>Etienne sighed and motioned to the vamps. \u201cBastien, meet our new recruits.\u201d</p><p>The vampires all relaxed. Apparently, they were new enough that they didn\u2019t consider him Bastien the Deceiver as the crazier ones did.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a fifth around the corner there. He was tranqed while helping us hold off the mercenaries,\u201d Etienne added.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Jeremy,\u201d Tar Heel proclaimed eagerly.</p><p>Bastien smiled and offered his hand. \u201cGood to meet you.\u201d He shook hands with the other vamps next, the action requiring each of them to sheath their weapons.</p><p>The man knew how to handle vampires.</p><p>Richart returned. \u201cSean\u2019s healing her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Would you be okay wrangling Bastien and the vampires by yourself? he asked mentally.</p><p>Of course. I used to hunt with him, remember?</p><p>Right. Etienne had forgotten.</p><p>A familiar passenger van full of network guards sped down the street and turned into the alley. A low rumbling told the immortals a bus full of cleaners followed more slowly.</p><p>Once more, the calvary had arrived.</p><p>Good timing, too. Cam must have lit a fire under their asses to get them here so fast.</p><p>Network guards approached, armed and alert, Chris at their forefront.</p><p>\u201cThe mercenaries are all either dead or down,\u201d Etienne informed them. \u201cThere\u2019s one on the roof there.\u201d He pointed. \u201cThe rest are on the ground.\u201d He motioned to their vampire audience. \u201cThese wise vampires have agreed to join us. Bastien will aid you with them. Richart will fill you in on the rest when he returns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s he going?\u201d Chris asked, issuing orders to his men with hand signals.</p><p>\u201cKrysta was shot twice and is at my home, being healed by Sean. Richart is going to take me to her, then return to offer his assistance, along with an accounting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Etienne hesitated. \u201cReally? You aren\u2019t going to bitch and moan about me not sticking around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve seen how you guys are with your girlfriends.\u201d</p><p>Etienne didn\u2019t bother to deny it this time. Hell, he wanted Krysta to be his girlfriend.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and take off. I\u2019ll handle things here.\u201d</p><p>Etienne frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to check them for tracking devices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Chris left to inspect the damage.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Richart asked.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Richart touched his shoulder. UNC\u2019s campus dissolved into Etienne\u2019s living room.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Etienne asked.</p><p>\u201cIn Lisette\u2019s room,\u201d Richart said. \u201cYou need blood first.\u201d</p><p>A thud sounded downstairs. Krysta cried out.</p><p>Etienne raced for his sister\u2019s bedroom and barreled through the open doorway.</p><p>Sean was on the floor beside the bed, Krysta and Cam kneeling beside him.</p><p>Krysta looked up when Etienne entered, tears in her eyes. \u201cHe collapsed after healing me.\u201d</p><p>Etienne nudged Cam aside and lifted Sean onto the bed. Blood stained Sean\u2019s shirt on his shoulder. Etienne tore the neck of Sean\u2019s T-shirt and pulled it down to confirm Krysta\u2019s wounds had opened on him. All of them by the looks of it.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never collapsed before,\u201d she said on a sob. \u201cIs he dead?\u201d</p><p>Etienne shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s alive.\u201d But he had expended all of his energy to heal her and, as a mortal, may now be incapable of healing himself. Etienne turned to Richart as he entered. \u201cGet Roland.\u201d</p><p>Richart grimaced and drew out his phone. \u201cI\u2019ll call Seth first. Roland tries to kill me whenever I teleport to his home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here if I weren\u2019t so good at dodging flying daggers.\u201d He dialed and held the phone to his ear.</p><p>Etienne took Krysta\u2019s hand and drew her up against his side. \u201cHe\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, tears spilling over her lashes. \u201cHe warned me so many times that I might kill him.\u201d</p><p>Etienne wrapped both arms around her trembling form. \u201cHe isn\u2019t gong to die, Krysta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not this time, but . . .\u201d</p><p>Perhaps she finally realized Sean was right.</p><p>The sounds of battle came over Richart\u2019s line, carrying to Etienne\u2019s sensitive ears.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth. Richart. Are you busy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne moment.\u201d The clang of metal striking metal reached them, accompanied by howls of pain. Many howls of pain. Then silence. \u201cNot right now, no. What do you need?\u201d</p><p>Etienne fought a smile.</p><p>\u201cSean collapsed after healing Krysta. Could you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Seth appeared beside Richart, pocketing his phone. \u201cLet me guess. Roland still hurls daggers at you whenever you teleport to his home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to talk to him about that.\u201d</p><p>Richart looked at Etienne. \u201cI\u2019m going to head back to UNC.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Richart vanished.</p><p>Seth approached the other side of the bed. \u201cSo. What happened?\u201d</p><p>Krysta sniffed. \u201cHe was just finishing up healing the worst of my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that,\u201d Seth interrupted, resting a hand on Sean\u2019s chest. \u201cHow were you injured?\u201d His hand began to glow.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Krysta stared.</p><p>Sean\u2019s pale face rapidly regained color.</p><p>Seth removed his hand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s . . . that\u2019s it?\u201d she asked incredulously. It had only lasted seconds and Seth didn\u2019t show any signs of fatigue at all.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered simply.</p><p>Unsure whether to believe him, she leaned down and pulled up Sean\u2019s shirt. No wounds marred his skin where hers had opened on his flesh. No bullet wounds. No gashes. No bruises. Only dried blood. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>I told you he was powerful, Etienne said.</p><p>I know, but . . . damn. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he waking up?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Even though Seth had healed him, Sean didn\u2019t stir.</p><p>\u201cHe expended all of his energy to heal you. He needs rest, so I commanded him to do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. And, despite the whole unconscious thing, he\u2019s obeying you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that kind of command. You might say I forced sleep upon him.\u201d Seth crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cOne more time. What happened?\u201d</p><p>Krysta and Etienne took turns telling him what had happened.</p><p>The powerful leader of the Immortal Guardians did not seem pleased.</p><p>\u201cFirst,\u201d he said, \u201cyou two need to abandon your doubts and insecurities and just get together already. You\u2019re so perfect for each other that you\u2019re finishing each other\u2019s sentences.\u201d</p><p>Krysta looked at Etienne, who seemed as taken aback as she felt. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe finish each other\u2019s sentences?\u201d Etienne asked.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized it either.</p><p>\u201cYes. Second, you left two vampires guarding Krysta?\u201d</p><p>Etienne nodded. \u201cIt was a risk I had to take. Their thoughts indicated they could be trusted to at least do that much. They were scared shitless and looked to me to get them out of there alive.\u201d</p><p>Krysta held up an index finger. \u201cI personally didn\u2019t think I needed a guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d Seth said in a tone that brooked no argument. \u201cHave Chris outfit you with a pair of Glock 18s with thirty-round clips like Lisette. Guns may not be your weapon of choice for taking out vampires, but they are good for holding off humans. You also should consider, once more, serving as a Second until this new mercenary threat has been extinguished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>He raised an imperious eyebrow. \u201cYou can see vampires coming and know their movements before they make them. But the auras of humans offer you no such warning, do they?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she muttered, reluctant to admit it.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t like to hear it, but you are a liability, Krysta. Etienne already has to divide his attention between fighting and reading the minds of as many opponents as he can. Keeping an eye or ear out for you, too, distracts him even more. He could have been hurt far more seriously than he was tonight as a result.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach sank as she turned to Etienne. \u201cYou were hurt?\u201d Krysta gave him a quick once-over, but there was no way to know how much of the blood painting him was his. And his coat had already sported several bullet holes before the night had begun because he had neither replaced nor mended it after his last encounter with mercenaries. \u201cWhere? What happened?\u201d</p> <p>He glared at Seth. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Seth shook his head, strolled around, and placed a hand on Etienne\u2019s chest. That hand began to glow as he healed Etienne\u2019s wounds. \u201cHe was shot multiple times by the mercenaries and suffered a few deep gashes at the hands of the vampires before they decided to join forces with you.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t known. She hadn\u2019t even guessed. How many of those injuries had he incurred while he was looking out for her? While he was distracted, listening to ensure the vampires hadn\u2019t either turned on her or abandoned her?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Etienne said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d She looked from him to Sean, lying so still on the bed.</p> <p>\u201cKrysta,\u201d Etienne said.</p><p>All she could do was stare at him, feeling sick inside.</p><p>From the corner of her eye, she saw Cam look back and forth between them and clear his throat. \u201cI, uh, I\u2019m going to go see what the word is on the vamps you recruited tonight.\u201d He backed out of the room.</p><p>Seth\u2019s hand ceased glowing as he dropped it from Etienne\u2019s chest. \u201cAnd I am going to go see if you left any mercenaries alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I have some minds to read. Hopefully, when I\u2019m finished, we will know who we are dealing with and how they learned about our existence so we can end this.\u201d</p> <p>He vanished.</p><p>When Etienne walked toward her, Krysta held up a hand to keep him at bay.</p><p>Etienne took that hand and carried her palm to his lips for a kiss. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeating yourself up. You were injured, too, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d she said, throat thick.</p> <p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it? How long did we walk and watch that campus? The mercenaries were likely there the whole time. But I forgot to use the damned infrared scope to check shadows too dark for my eyes to pierce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I distracted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m accustomed to not needing it, to depending upon my own enhanced vision. Had I been more thorough, I would have known they were there, summoned aid, and captured them all alive without you suffering a single injury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy being shot wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my being shot wasn\u2019t yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean collapsing was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean knows his limits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I pushed him to those limits. You aren\u2019t going to make me feel better about any of this.\u201d</p><p>Etienne sighed. \u201cFine. Then make me feel better about it.\u201d Tugging her hand, he brought her close and wrapped his arms around her.</p><p>Krysta leaned into him, locking her arms around his waist.</p><p>\u201cI should be angry at you, but not for any of the reasons you think,\u201d he muttered, resting his cheek on her head.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou actually made me understand Bastien,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d she asked, tired, lost.</p><p>\u201cBastien is not my favorite person. Despite what I learned about him recently, I have not been able to abandon my dislike for him entirely because he killed a friend of mine two hundred years ago. But there was a night\u2014before I met you\u2014when he thought the woman he loved had been killed and went berserk in the true sense of the word. He painted UNC red with blood and was coated with it himself by the time I came upon him. I thought he had gone mad. He was, for all intents and purposes, gone, wanting only to kill and punish. And, tonight, when I saw those bullets strike you, I wanted the same. I knew exactly how he felt.\u201d His arms tightened around her. \u201cI wanted to kill every mercenary, then kill every vampire for distracting me so much that I didn\u2019t hear the damned mercenaries\u2019 approach until it was too late. But I couldn\u2019t. I had to think of the fucking greater good,\u201d he said with such disgust that she found a laugh. \u201cI had to take some of them alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d better damn well yield some information.\u201d</p><p>She hoped so. Those bastards had tried to kill her. Again.</p><p>The two of them stood that way for Krysta didn\u2019t know how long. A minute passed. Ten? Twenty? She couldn\u2019t tell and didn\u2019t really care.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she whispered, unable to calm her thoughts.</p><p>Leaning back, he gazed down at her.</p><p>His handsome face wavered as moisture welled in her eyes. When a tear slipped over her lashes and trailed down one cheek, he brushed it away with his thumb.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThis is all I\u2019ve known, Etienne, all I\u2019ve done, for six years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never told me what sparked your vampire-hunting career. Not all of it anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a student at UNC,\u201d she began, reluctant to revive those memories. \u201cMy fiancE and I were walking back to the dorm one night\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were engaged?\u201d he interrupted.</p><p>Was that jealousy sharpening his tone?</p><p>She nodded. \u201cMichael and his family moved into a house down the street when we were both in the ninth grade. We hit it off from the start, became best friends, and\u201d\u2014she shrugged\u2014\u201cfell in love. We dated throughout high school and intended to marry as soon as we finished college.\u201d It all seemed so long ago. Another life. Another her. She had been so young and na\u00efve and innocent then. Michael had been, too. Looking back, it sometimes felt as though decades had passed since that last night they had been together instead of a mere half dozen years.</p><p>Were Michael alive today, she doubted he would even recognize the hardened warrior she had become.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Michael and I were walking back to the dorm when two vampires attacked us. They tortured Michael. And made me watch.\u201d It had been agonizing. And was still agonizing to recall. She doubted any amount of time would alter that or lessen the impact his screams of pain had had on her, though her grief had finally dulled. \u201cThen one bit me and I lost consciousness, I think from blood loss. I don\u2019t know what happened after that, why they let me live. But I never forgot their faces or what they were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you remember it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the chemical that you told me is released when vampires or immortals bite someone works on me.\u201d Apparently it acted like GHB and made victims more pliable. It also affected their memories, which explained why none of the victims she had spoken with had had any recollection of being attacked.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe policeman who took my report at the hospital. He said I had been rufied and was confusing things. He didn\u2019t believe the vampires were real.\u201d Her gaze strayed to the bed. \u201cSean believed me, but told me I\u2019d be committed if I didn\u2019t stop pushing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you decided to hunt them down yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Hunting and destroying vampires is all that has driven me for years. How can I give that up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. I can\u2019t keep hurting the people I care about. I have to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean is going to be fine, Krysta.\u201d</p><p>She took a chance and met his gaze. \u201cI wasn\u2019t just talking about Sean.\u201d</p><p>He stilled.</p><p>\u201cTwice now Seth has warned me I\u2019m a liability. By stubbornly insisting on hunting, I\u2019m endangering you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about that. I\u2019m immortal. I can take it.\u201d He cupped her face in both hands and studied her intently. \u201cAre you saying you care about me?\u201d</p><p>Krysta didn\u2019t think she had ever felt so vulnerable in her life. Not emotionally anyway.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d he said with a gentle smile. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to answer that.\u201d</p><p>Hell. She was too tired and heartsick to lie or evade. \u201cI think I\u2019m falling in love with you,\u201d she confessed.</p><p>He sucked in a sharp breath. His eyes flashed bright amber.</p><p>Etienne thought his heart would burst from his chest. \u201cWhat?\u201d The jealousy that had infiltrated him as she had spoken of Michael fled.</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cDon\u2019t make me say it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u2019</p><p>\u201cBecause it scares the hell out of me.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her lovely face with his thumbs. \u201cIt scares me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would it scare you? You\u2019ve probably been with hundreds of women and had dozens of relationships.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThere have been fewer than you think. And I didn\u2019t love any of them. I fell for you the first night I saw you fight vampires.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why was I so relieved to learn you and Sean were brother and sister, rather than lovers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m over two hundred years old, Krysta, and have never been so drawn to a woman before, so consumed by thoughts of her or longings for her. I\u2019m falling in love for the first time in my long existence. It\u2019s rather . . . daunting.\u201d Confessing it was even more so.</p><p>Reaching up, she pressed her palm to his cheek.</p><p>He turned into her touch, nuzzling her soft skin.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do about it?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI know what I want to do about it,\u201d he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d Dipping his head, he brushed his lips against hers.</p><p>Etienne hadn\u2019t lied. He had never longed so much for a woman, her company, her touch . . . and that longing magnified a hundredfold when Krysta parted her lips and drew her tongue across his lower lip.</p> <p>Flames licked his veins as he deepened the kiss, stroking her tongue with his own, eliciting a feminine moan. And, oh, what that moan did to him.</p><p>He tightened his hold, pressed her as close to him as he could get her, his body burning at every contact point.</p><p>Rising onto her toes, she locked her arms around his neck. His pulse raced as she combed her fingers through his hair and clenched them, giving a light tug, even as she rubbed her hips against his erection.</p><p>Oh, yeah.</p><p>A throaty laugh escaped her.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Urging her back against the wall, he slid one hand down over her tempting ass and ground her against him. Damn, she felt good.</p><p>\u201cYou project your thoughts when you\u2019re turned on,\u201d she purred.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cSo do you.\u201d</p><p>Obeying one of those thoughts, which mirrored his own desires, he found one of her breasts with his free hand. Small and firm, it fit perfectly in the palm of his hand, just as he had known it would. He teased her nipple, hard beneath her shirt and sports bra. Stroked it. Pinched it.</p><p>She moaned and strained closer, her heart pounding so hard he could feel it in his own chest. More.</p><p>He lowered his fingers to the hem of her shirt, slipped his hand beneath it and smoothed it up her warm, satiny skin. Squeezing beneath her tight sports bra, he again palmed her breast.</p> <p>She gasped. Releasing his hair, she lowered one hand to his chest.</p><p>At first, he thought she meant to stop him. She covered his hand with hers over her bra, squeezed. Then, she moved on, forging a burning path down his stomach to cup his heavy erection.</p><p>He groaned and thrust against her.</p><p>Smiling against his lips, she drew her hand back.</p><p>Etienne\u2019s heart damned near stopped when she slid one leg up his and hooked it over his hip, opening herself to him. Urged on by her thoughts and her delicious body, he rocked against her.</p><p>Both moaned this time, loving it, needing it, equally frustrated by the cloth that separated them.</p><p>Trailing his lips across her cheek, he licked and kissed his way down to the soft skin at the base of her neck. \u201cWrap both legs around me,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Krysta\u2019s already racing heart went wild at the hoarse request. Without hesitating, she jumped up and wrapped her other leg around his hips.</p> <p>A breeze whipped her as their surroundings blurred. Then she found herself in another bedroom. Very masculine. Very posh. Very neat for the bedroom of a longtime bachelor.</p><p>She met Etienne\u2019s glowing gaze.</p><p>\u201cI want to make love to you,\u201d he stated boldly.</p><p>She swallowed hard and nodded. She wanted it, too.</p><p>\u201cCall me crazy,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t want to do it in front of your brother.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cOh, crap.\u201d She had been crawling all over Etienne with Sean lying in bed just a few feet away. \u201cHow did you make me forget about him?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and strolled toward the bed, every movement creating lip-biting friction between their bodies. \u201cI would have forgotten myself if my hearing weren\u2019t acute enough to pick up his breathing and heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>He stopped beside the bed.</p><p>Krysta lowered her legs to the floor and stood for a moment, staring up at him, her body tingling and aching for his touch.</p><p>\u201cYou can change your mind,\u201d he murmured, so damned sweet and understanding it only made her want him more.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI want this.\u201d Again, she reached up and stroked his face, \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, he looked so hungry for her she thought he might pounce.</p><p>Then a teasing gleam entered his luminous eyes. \u201cWant to see a neat trick?\u201d</p><p>Raising her eyebrows, she smiled. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He blurred. She felt a tug.</p><p>In a blink, they were both naked, clothing and weapons scattered around their feet.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you so wide-eyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is awesome!\u201d she praised.</p><p>Grinning, he picked her up and tossed her onto the bed.</p><p>Krysta shrieked with delight as he dove after her.</p><p>\u201cShoes on or off?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She laughed when she realized they both still wore their boots. \u201cOff.\u201d</p><p>Sitting up, he quickly doffed his own, then turned his attention to hers.</p><p>She liked this playful side of him. Liked the feel of his large, warm hands grasping her calf as he removed first one shoe, then the other.</p><p>His gaze roved her body, splayed out before him like a banquet, scorching her and making her squirm with the need to feel all of that hard, muscled flesh against her.</p><p>And, just like that, all levity was shoved aside by lust.</p><p>He peeled a sock off, kissed her ankle, lowered her foot to one side of him. Peeling the second sock off, he kissed that ankle and lowered her foot to the other side of him. He smoothed his hands up her calves, up her thighs, his thumbs coming so close to the heart of her.</p><p>Damn, she wanted him.</p><p>He growled, exciting her even more. \u201cNow you\u2019re the one projecting.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught as he rose above her and settled his big, warm body between her thighs.</p><p>Etienne wanted Krysta so badly he nearly shook with it as he palmed one of her breasts.</p><p>Lowering his head, he drew the hard tip of her other breast into his mouth, loving the feel of her writhing beneath him. His fangs descended, as they often did when he experienced strong emotion, but he was careful not to let them pierce her soft skin.</p><p>\u201cAre you hearing my thoughts?\u201d she asked, her small hands exploring his back and hips.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d They fired his need as much as her touch did.</p><p>\u201cThen you know what I want,\u201d she gasped, burying her hands in his hair as he teased her nipple with his tongue.</p><p>Fast and hard.</p><p>The thought came through loud and clear.</p><p>Reaching down between them, he found her already wet and eager for his touch, arching up when his fingers found her clit.</p><p>Now, she insisted. Please, Etienne. I want you now.</p><p>Hell, yeah.</p><p>Positioning his cock at her entrance, he met her gaze and slowly pressed forward. An inch. Then another. And another. Slowly stretching her. Savoring the feel of her.</p><p>She groaned. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>He winked, struggling to maintain his tenuous hold on control. \u201cBut what a way to go.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>He plunged inside to the hilt.</p><p>Both gasped.</p><p>She was so warm and wet and tight.</p><p>\u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Krysta shook her head, catching the concern in his eyes as he gazed down at her. She hadn\u2019t been with anyone in a long time and Etienne was big, but . . . \u201cYou feel so good,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>He withdrew, almost leaving her entirely, then thrust again. Hard.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d She slid her hands down that wide, muscled back and over his ass as he thrust again. \u201cYessss.\u201d</p><p>He thrust again, sending sparks of pleasure dancing through her.</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d she urged, wanting more, needing more.</p><p>And he gave her what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cYou are so fucking beautiful,\u201d he murmured, taking her lips in a passionate kiss. \u201cThe things I want to do to you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she panted, pleasure mounting.</p><p>He did. In explicit detail. Making blood rush to her face and her body burn hotter as he explored her flesh with his hands and that wicked mouth, continuing those long, deep thrusts until an orgasm ripped through her, stealing her breath and wringing a cry from her lips.</p><p>As her body continued to ripple with sensation, he stiffened above her and cried out with his own. Breathing hard, he closed his eyes and lowered his forehead to hers, those strong arms keeping the bulk of his weight off of her.</p><p>Her own chest rose and fell so fast one would think she had just run a marathon. Heart still pounding, peace sifting through her, Krysta was content to just lie quietly and enjoy the moment.</p><p>Her hands didn\u2019t quite get the message, though. She couldn\u2019t resist the need to slowly slide them up and down his back, loving the feel of all of that strength above her.</p><p>At last he raised his head. The amber glow in the eyes that met hers had lessened, allowing some of the brown to seep through.</p><p>He stroked her hair, both his touch and his expression tender. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if he was asking if she was okay physically\u2014it had been a long time and he hadn\u2019t exactly been gentle, giving her exactly what she had wanted\u2014or if she was okay emotionally. But the answer to both was, \u201cMore than okay.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and delivered a gentle kiss that stole her heart. Then he dipped his head and kissed her shoulder, where she had been shot.</p><p>Rolling them to their sides, he settled his head close to hers on the pillow.</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cNo lingering pain from your injuries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Which made her realize . . .</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, recognizing her unease.</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cIs it weird that we didn\u2019t wash the blood off first?\u201d Both had been wounded. And, though their wounds had been healed, smudges of dried blood remained where bullets and blades had marked them.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he responded, the lack of concern in his voice a relief. \u201cThe blood is ours and we\u2019re both so accustomed to seeing it that it means little to us. And, on my part at least, I wanted you so badly that I could think of nothing else.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>A teasing glint once more entered his light brown eyes. \u201cIf, however, it troubles you, I think there is only one thing we must do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d she asked with false gravity.</p><p>\u201cHead in there . . .\u201d he pointed to a door across the room that opened onto a bathroom.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImmerse ourselves in the cleansing waters of a whirlpool bath . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m liking it so far.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBathe every inch of each other\u2019s body . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally liking it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen make love again, giving me a chance to do some of those things I mentioned wanting to do to you.\u201d</p> <p>Her pulse jumped. \u201cGo get the water running,\u201d she encouraged him in a throaty voice she barely recognized as her own.</p><p>Grinning, he stole a kiss, then leapt naked from the bed, giving her an eyeful of aroused immortal male as he headed into the bathroom.</p><p>Smiling, Krysta scooted off the bed and followed.</p><p>Seth felt his fury rise as he examined the unconscious mercenaries. There were eight of them being held in one of the holding rooms designed for vampires at network headquarters. All were chained together and lay on cots that had been hastily erected. Not to make the men more comfortable, he suspected, but so he wouldn\u2019t have to kneel down to read their minds if touching them became necessary.</p><p>Two of the mercenaries were brain-damaged. The immortals were still having trouble determining how hard they could hit humans without killing them or rendering them useless.</p> <p>He rested his palm on the forehead of a third, then a fourth, a fifth, his anger mounting.</p><p>He turned to face his companions.</p><p>Chris, Bastien, and Melanie all took a cautious step backward.</p><p>Bastien wrapped a protective arm around Melanie\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>Seth drew in a deep breath and let some of the rage drain out of him. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>Bastien frowned. \u201cDid Richart and Etienne hit them too hard?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA couple of them. But those who are merely unconscious yield no information that can aid us. They don\u2019t know who their commander is. They don\u2019t know the name of his operation. And they don\u2019t know where it is located.\u201d</p><p>Chris swore. \u201cHow the hell is that possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEach one of them was recruited from another PMC, except for that one. He\u2019s an army veteran. Chris, I\u2019d like to see if we can\u2019t win him over to our side. He seems like a good man. He\u2019s just been misled.\u201d</p><p>Chris nodded.</p><p>\u201cAll are single\u2014no families\u2014and were approached by a man who claimed he worked for an elite Private Military Company that regularly received government contracts. He told them he had a highly secretive mission that involved homeland security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he bullshitting?\u201d Chris asked.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t know for sure until we confront their commander. Once they consented, he sedated them and took them to the compound from which they operate. They travel to and from it either blindfolded or in windowless transport vehicles. They don\u2019t know where it is. And they don\u2019t know who he is. He gave them a code name.\u201d</p><p>Bastien frowned. \u201cAre they stupid? How can they just go gunning for people based on something someone they can\u2019t even identify told them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t stupid. Just gullible. Mostly. Those three there would shoot their own grandmother for a paycheck. And they were offered a big paycheck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow big?\u201d Melanie asked.</p><p>\u201cThe equivalent of a Second\u2019s salary.\u201d</p><p>Chris whistled. \u201cSo whoever these guys are, they\u2019re very well funded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich makes them even more dangerous,\u201d Seth finished for him. More money meant more resources.</p><p>Bastien released Melanie and strolled forward to scowl down at the men. \u201cSo there\u2019s nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see the face of the man who recruited them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I don\u2019t recognize him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Bastien combed his fingers through his long hair. \u201cIf these men know nothing, we have no reason to believe any of the others will tell us anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p><p>Quiet filled the room as brows furrowed.</p><p>They had been operating on the assumption that, if they could capture one of the mercenaries, Seth could learn the whereabouts of the group and they could swoop in and kill them.</p><p>And they did intend to kill them this time. All of them.</p><p>Chris\u2019s face suddenly brightened. \u201cTracking devices.\u201d</p><p>Seth tilted his head to one side. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir minds may not be able to tell us where their base is, but their bodies can. We do to them what they did to us. Plant tracking devices on them and let them lead us home.\u201d</p><p>Seth met Bastien\u2019s gaze. \u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>Bastien nodded. \u201cThey think we\u2019re monsters. I doubt they would credit us with the forethought it would take to turn the tables on them.\u201d</p><p>Melanie didn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cWhat if they\u2019re more paranoid than that? What if they check the men with metal detectors the way Chris checked these and the vampires you brought in?\u201d</p><p>Bastien shrugged. \u201cPlant the devices on their weapons. I\u2019m sure they disarm before they\u2019re scanned. If they\u2019re scanned.\u201d</p><p>Chris smiled. \u201cYou devious bastard. That would work.\u201d</p><p>Bastien raised an eyebrow. \u201cIs it doable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yes. You saw how small the one the mercenaries used was. My tech guys can duplicate that and make it magnetic,\u201d Chris said. \u201cWould you and the other immortals be able to plant them on the weapons without them knowing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo quote you, Hell, yes.\u201d</p><p>Seth nodded. It was a solid plan. And it was good to see these two working together and leaving past animosities behind them. He clapped Bastien on the back and looked to Chris. \u201cPut your men on it immediately and distribute the devices to all of the immortals in the area when you have enough. Their Seconds, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on it. What do you want me to do with these guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold them for now. Preferably elsewhere so their complaints and shouting, once they awaken, won\u2019t disturb the vampires.\u201d</p><p>Chris nodded. \u201cWhen Bastien started talking about recruiting vampires, I bought an abandoned missile silo and outfitted it with all of the trappings of a vampire\u2019s prison in case the shit hit the fan. Do you want me to transfer them there?\u201d</p><p>Once more, Chris had thought of everything. He was a damned good man to have on their side. \u201cSounds perfect. We\u2019ll decide what to do with them after we discover who their commander is. Keep the veteran comfortable, though. The others are in it for the money. He\u2019s in it to protect his country.\u201d And he likely would be the only one Seth would let live . . . if the man joined them.</p><p>\u201cAnd the vamps?\u201d Chris asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see to them next.\u201d</p><p>Bastien took a step forward. \u201cThey seem sincere in their desire to side with us against the mercenaries.\u201d He wanted so badly to help vampires, having seen firsthand so many fight the madness that infects them.</p><p>Seth looked to Chris. \u201cWould adding new apartments be a problem?\u201d</p><p>Chris glanced at Bastien. \u201cThis far underground, it would be a bit of a challenge, but it\u2019s possible.\u201d He met Seth\u2019s gaze. \u201cI\u2019m more concerned about security. If you give all of them the okay, we\u2019ll have seven vampires living here amongst the human employees. We\u2019ve given Cliff and Stuart more leeway lately and let them move around more freely on this floor. We can\u2019t do that with seven vamps. Not unless you start assigning immortals to serve as guards. Two vampires against three dozen human guards armed with automatic weapons and tranquilizer guns won\u2019t win. Seven might.\u201d</p><p>Seth corrected him. \u201cThree dozen guards and one immortal. Melanie is very strong. As strong as Roland despite her youth.\u201d</p><p>Chris swore. \u201cI keep forgetting she\u2019s immortal now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Bastien lingers here most nights.\u201d</p><p>Bastien caught Seth\u2019s gaze and tapped his temple. Can you hear me?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Would you take the four of us somewhere private for a moment? Somewhere the vamps can\u2019t hear us.</p><p>Seth teleported them to Chris\u2019s home and used telekinesis to flick on the lights.</p><p>Giving their surroundings a hasty inspection, Melanie wrinkled her nose.</p><p>Bastien took in the piles of clothes, stacks of papers, discarded pizza boxes, and assorted other crap that cluttered the living room floor and furniture and frowned. \u201cWhere the hell are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy home,\u201d Chris said, glaring at Seth, \u201cand don\u2019t say a word.\u201d</p><p>Bastien wisely held his tongue. \u201cLook, the whole purpose of recruiting vampires is to get them to help us spread the word and get other vampires to avoid the mercenaries. Or help us fight as they did tonight, if it comes to that. They can\u2019t do that cooped up at the network.\u201d</p><p>Seth agreed. \u201cWhat do you propose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should see if Melanie can find a way to surgically implant tracking devices on the vampires, so we can turn them loose every night.\u201d</p><p>Melanie regarded him with surprise.</p><p>\u201cRichart can teleport them to my old lair each evening, so they won\u2019t be able to disclose the location of the network. They can then roam where they will and get the word out to other vampires. When they return to my lair before dawn, Richart can then bring them back.\u201d</p><p>Chris arched a brow. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll just go on faith that they aren\u2019t preying upon innocents while they\u2019re roaming where they will and getting the word out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can reduce the chances of that by keeping them supplied with blood at the network and having Lisette or Etienne read their thoughts nightly or weekly, however you want to do it. I\u2019ll hunt while the vamps are out and about. And, when they\u2019re not, I\u2019ll serve as guard at the network. At least while Melanie is working.\u201d</p><p>Chris gaped at him. \u201cYou serve as guard? Are you shitting me?\u201d</p><p>Bastien shrugged. \u201cIt would allow me to spend more time with Melanie. Cliff and Stuart like me being around. The new vamps will likely be more comfortable with me around. It\u2019s a win-win situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Chris said, \u201cexcept most of the emergencies we\u2019ve had at the network in recent years\u2014which spawned many injuries and a hell of a lot of damage to the property\u2014were instigated by you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>Chris just pointed at Bastien and looked at Seth.</p><p>Seth shrugged. \u201cBastien is with Melanie now. He has a vested interest in keeping things calm and safe around there. And, if he gets out of hand himself, Melanie will kick his ass.\u201d</p> <p>Melanie smiled.</p><p>Bastien grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s strong enough to do it, too.\u201d</p><p>Chris shook his head. \u201cYou are so fucking weird. Fine. Seth, if you want the new vampires to live at the network with the others, I\u2019ll begin construction on the apartments as soon as you give me the go-ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone. What about Bastien\u2019s desire to let the vamps roam North Carolina freely?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s wait on that, give the vamps some time to settle in, and see if Melanie will be able to make the tracking devices work.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cThe challenge will be finding a way to keep the virus from expelling the devices the way it does bullets and other foreign objects . . . without the aid of the tranquilizer, that is. We know the tranquilizer slows down the healing process, and could probably help, but the vamps will need their wits if they\u2019re going to be mingling with other vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they can\u2019t know about them,\u201d Chris added, \u201cor they\u2019ll just dig them out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bury the memory of them,\u201d Seth said.</p><p>Bastien spoke up. \u201cIf she can make it work, I\u2019d like to take Cliff and Stuart hunting with me while the other vampires are out spreading the word.\u201d</p><p>Chris stared at him. \u201cHunting? You want vampires to help you hunt and destroy other vampires?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn violent, bloody battles, armed with weapons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Both Cliff and Stuart have proven their loyalty to us.\u201d</p><p>The two vamps had indeed proven their loyalty, but . . . \u201cCliff has been infected long enough to suffer the consequences,\u201d Seth reminded him gently. He didn\u2019t need to see the MRIs to know the damage had begun.</p><p>\u201cI know. But he\u2019s holding it together,\u201d Bastien insisted. \u201cAnd I think he\u2019ll hold it together a little longer if he can get some fresh air and exercise. He\u2019s been cooped up at the network too long without reprieve.\u201d</p><p>Bastien loved Cliff like a brother. A quick look into his thoughts told Seth Bastien wanted the young vampire to experience a last taste of freedom before the madness claimed him. And Seth, after his own attempts to help the young vampire, held the same desire. Cliff had proven to be incredibly strong and fierce in his determination to hold off the madness. It was going to break Bastien\u2019s heart when he finally lost the battle. Melanie\u2019s, too.</p><p>\u201cIf Cliff broke and made a run for it, do you think you could catch him?\u201d Seth asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d And the dread in Bastien\u2019s face and voice told them all without words that he would do what had to be done when he caught him, just as he had with Vince.</p> <p>Melanie took his hand.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Seth decreed. \u201cCliff has always been loyal to you, Sebastien. You need not wait and can begin taking him hunting with you now. Stuart and the others, however, will have to wait for the tracking devices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The fact that Chris made no objection confirmed that even he had a soft spot for Cliff.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. I\u2019ll meet with the vampires now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I accompany you?\u201d Bastien asked.</p><p>Seth grinned as Chris\u2019s mouth fell open once more. \u201cMelanie has been a good influence on you.\u201d</p><p>Bastien grimaced and swore. \u201cI\u2019m doing it again, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing nice,\u201d he said with much disgust.</p><p>Melanie smiled.</p><p>Seth laughed. \u201cYes.\u201d He teleported them back to the holding room with the mercenaries. \u201cShall we?\u201d He could have just popped them into the room with the vampires, but knew the network guards liked to keep track of their movements for safety\u2019s sake.</p><p>Bastien kissed Melanie, then led Seth out into the hallway and to the holding room next door.</p><p>Melanie returned to her office while Chris headed for the elevators.</p><p>A guard standing in front of the vampires\u2019 holding room took a security card from his pocket.</p><p>Seth shook his head and waved a hand in front of the lock. A thunk sounded. Opening the heavy door, he stepped inside, Bastien right on his heels.</p><p>A thought closed the door behind them.</p><p>Five vampires stood shoulder to shoulder, eyes wide with trepidation, heavy titanium chains weighing down their right arms and anchoring them to the walls.</p><p>Seth said nothing as he scanned their minds.</p><p>The virus had not progressed far in these. The brain damage was minimal. They must have all been turned during the past year.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, gentlemen. I\u2019m Seth, leader of the Immortal Guardians.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged nervous looks.</p><p>One wearing a Tar Heels T-shirt swallowed. \u201cAre you the one they call the Day Walker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do they call you that?\u201d another asked.</p><p>Seth glanced at Bastien, who clapped a hand to his forehead. \u201cBecause I can walk in daylight,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cOhhhhhhh.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so he wasn\u2019t the smartest kid Seth had encountered. At least he wasn\u2019t manic.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t sleeping,\u201d Etienne commented.</p><p>He lay on his back, Krysta\u2019s lovely naked body cuddled up against his side in bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m procrastinating,\u201d she said, drawing circles on his chest with her fingers.</p><p>\u201cAbout sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. There\u2019s something I want to ask you and I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019re going to react.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that I like the sound of that,\u201d he admitted. Tentative was not a word he would ordinarily use to describe her.</p><p>She sat up, the covers falling to her waist, and swiveled to face him.</p><p>Etienne\u2019s gaze instantly dropped to her breasts.</p><p>She began to speak earnestly, but\u2014for the life of him\u2014Etienne didn\u2019t know what she was saying.</p><p>He held up a hand.</p><p>She quieted.</p><p>He raised his eyes. \u201cIf there\u2019s something you wish to discuss, you\u2019re going to have to cover up. I can\u2019t concentrate with your beautiful breasts in my face, tempting me to touch and taste them.\u201d</p><p>She dragged the covers up and tucked them under her arms, her lips forming a small smile. \u201cWhat breasts? I\u2019m built like a ten-year-old boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you are. I love your breasts. They\u2019re perfect. And, if you doubt that . . .\u201d He motioned to the sheet tenting over his erection.</p><p>She smiled and licked her lips. \u201cOoh. Nice.\u201d</p><p>His breath caught as she reached for him.</p><p>Stopping inches away, she drew her hand back. \u201cNo. Not now. I really do need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Damn.</p><p>\u201cBut hold that thought.\u201d</p><p>He could do that. \u201cWhat\u2019s troubling you?\u201d He took her hand and began to toy with her fingers. Did she regret making love with him?</p><p>\u201cThe same thing that troubled me before,\u201d she answered. \u201cWith the mercenary threat combining with the increased vampire population, I can\u2019t continue to hunt the way I have been. I\u2019m putting too many people I care about in danger.\u201d</p><p>And he was one of those people. Etienne still couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cKrysta, I told you. You aren\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an obvious solution. One that will keep me from putting you in danger and from harming Sean when he heals my wounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Had she decided to follow Seth\u2019s advice and become a Second? As much as Etienne wished to keep her safe, he would miss hunting with her each night.</p><p>\u201cI want you to transform me,\u201d she blurted, then held her breath.</p><p>Etienne stared, convinced he had heard her wrong. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to transform me.\u201d</p><p>His heart began to thud against his ribs. His hand tightened on hers. He sat up, the motion drawing them closer. \u201cKrysta . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust hear me out,\u201d she said anxiously.</p><p>\u201cOnly weeks ago you thought I was a vampire and were contemplating killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t. I mean, I did think you were a vampire, but I already knew I couldn\u2019t kill you. You\u2019re freaking irresistible and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he said, just to goad her.</p><p>Smiling, she shoved him in the shoulder with her free hand.</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cI hear what you\u2019re saying.\u201d Her face grew solemn. \u201cBut I know now that you\u2019re immortal. That you\u2019re just like me, only infected with a virus. I know you won\u2019t go crazy. I know you don\u2019t prey upon innocents. I know how the virus works. Sean has spent every night with Dr. Lipton and explained everything to me in excruciating detail. I just think this is the best solution. The only solution.\u201d She tightened her hold on his hand, her face earnest. \u201cIf you transformed me and made me immortal, I could keep hunting and hold my own better against vampires. And I would heal without Sean\u2019s help if mercenaries shot me.\u201d</p><p>The thought of her being shot made him lose his erection. He hated the idea of her getting hurt.</p><p>\u201cSean would be safe. You would be safe, knowing I could take care of myself\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think I would stop worrying about you if you were immortal, you are mistaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you would worry about me less, right? Because a bullet wound or two or four wouldn\u2019t kill me or endanger my life.\u201d</p><p>Yes, damn it.</p><p>\u201cRight?\u201d she pressed.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he conceded.</p><p>\u201cThen . . . what do you think? Will you do it?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to rush into anything. I know seeing Sean collapse shook you, but there are other healers among us to whom you could go when\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t keep depending on someone else to patch me up. I want to be able to heal on my own. Like you and the other Immortal Guardians. I want to be able to continue hunting vampires. I want to be able to help you defeat your enemies.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve tried to kill you three times. They\u2019re your enemies as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And I\u2019m vulnerable, facing them as I am. I want to be strong like you. I don\u2019t want to have to settle. I don\u2019t want to have to stop hunting and become a Second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeconds fight in battles, too. I\u2019ve lost more than one in the past to vampires\u2019 blades.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut they don\u2019t actively hunt.\u201d</p><p>No, they didn\u2019t.</p><p>Etienne studied her. He wanted to be objective here, to look out for her best interests instead of going with his own. Did he want her to transform? Absolutely. They had made no promises to each other yet, but they had each admitted they were falling in love and . . .</p><p>He couldn\u2019t deny that an eternity spent hunting alongside Krysta sounded blissful. An eternity laughing with her and teasing her. Making love with her.</p><p>But those were all his wishes.</p> <p>This was a decision which, once acted upon, was irreversible.</p><p>\u201cLet me read your thoughts,\u201d he requested.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me read your thoughts. All of them, not just those you send me. I need to know you really have considered this thoroughly and have no doubts. No reservations. That this isn\u2019t a knee-jerk reaction to Sean collapsing.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated.</p><p>\u201cSeth will insist on doing the same before he renders his decision.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have to ask his permission?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s our leader. That\u2019s how it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look too pleased.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to answer to Seth if you transform, Krysta. You\u2019ll have to obey the rules like the rest of us. And his orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . I kinda already am, so . . .\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow.</p> <p>\u201cOkay. I won\u2019t lie. It\u2019ll be hard. I\u2019ve been doing my own thing for years. But you did say he\u2019s the wisest among you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will make it a little easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? Your thoughts?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cI\u2019m not hesitating because I have doubts. I\u2019m hesitating because there are things up there that I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for you to see.\u201d</p><p>He supposed he would feel the same way. But Etienne wouldn\u2019t approach Seth with the request until he was sure she wasn\u2019t merely panicking and grasping at straws after seeing her brother collapse, pale as death, after healing her. Or panicking over having to give up hunting. Or just plain panicking. She could have been killed tonight. Again.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said, thrusting her chin forward. \u201cRead my thoughts.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he sensed she had let down her guard, Etienne explored her thoughts. There was guilt and concern for Sean. Guilt and concern for him. Conviction that transforming was the best course of action for her. A lot of lust for him. And . . .</p><p>His pulse began to pound in his ears.</p><p>Love.</p><p>Krysta loved him.</p><p>After learning she\u2019d been engaged, Etienne had feared her heart would always belong to Michael, but . . .</p><p>She really did love him. Him. Etienne.</p><p>She was afraid to believe it, because it had happened so fast. But she loved being with him. Hunting. Talking. Laughing and teasing. Making love. Watching television. Sharing a sandwich. Even just sitting quietly on this campus or that, their shoulders and thighs touching as the night breeze caressed them.</p><p>And he felt the same. Etienne hadn\u2019t realized he could fall in love so quickly, but living with her these past two weeks and spending so much time together . . .</p><p>He couldn\u2019t get enough of her and was astounded that she felt the same way.</p><p>Dipping his head, he took her lips in a long, passionate kiss.</p><p>She drew back. \u201cDamn it! I didn\u2019t want you to see that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow I feel about you! That\u2019s why you kissed me, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She covered her face with her hands and spoke something so jumbled into them that he couldn\u2019t decipher it.</p><p>\u201cKrysta, sweetheart.\u201d He pried her hands away from her pink face. \u201cI feel the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d she asked uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s too soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it feels that way. But it\u2019s not like we\u2019re dating and only see each other a couple of nights a week. We\u2019ve been together constantly since you and Sean moved in, only parting to sleep.\u201d He smiled. \u201cAnd there were times we didn\u2019t even do that.\u201d</p><p>At last, he managed to coax a faint smile from her. \u201cTrue.\u201d She sighed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see anything else up there that would embarrass me, did you?\u201d</p><p>He winked. \u201cI saw some very interesting fantasies you\u2019ve been fabricating around me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you did,\u201d she acknowledged dryly.</p><p>\u201cWould you by any chance care to explore a couple? No, make that a few. We have all day.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you aren\u2019t ready\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cWait. We\u2019re getting distracted again. Are you going to transform me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will take the request to Seth and, if he gives his permission . . .\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll transform you.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, she threw her arms around his neck and hugged him close, those tantalizing breasts pressed to his bare chest. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hands up and down her back, loving the feel of her soft, soft skin. \u201cThere is one thing though . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap.\u201d Releasing him, she plopped back onto her heels. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYounger immortals are always weaker than older immortals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Sean said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah isn\u2019t. She was turned only two or three years ago and should be weaker than I. Instead, she\u2019s as strong as her husband, Roland, who turned her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he like a thousand years old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose to it, yes. We don\u2019t know if she\u2019s so strong because of his age or because he\u2019s a healer. But you might consider having Roland turn you.\u201d</p><p>She scrunched up her face. \u201cI\u2019d rather you do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be linked to him emotionally afterward, if that\u2019s your fear,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cEuw. I didn\u2019t even think of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would be stronger than me,\u201d he said, even as he wondered how he would talk Roland into doing it.</p><p>\u201cIf you turned me, would I be as strong as you or weaker than you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. If the age of the immortal and not his gift is the determining factor, then you would have the same strength I possess, I would imagine. Perhaps slightly less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so hasty, Krysta. Being stronger would be an advantage. The stronger you are, the safer you are in battles against mercenaries and vampires. You\u2019ll move faster. You\u2019ll heal faster. You\u2019ll have a greater tolerance for the sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to transform me.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand. \u201cJust think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to. If I spent a month mulling it over, I would come to the same conclusion. If Seth says I can be transformed, I want you to be the one to do it,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>And he wanted to be the one to do it. But he wanted her to be safe even more. \u201cOkay. Then mull this over. When we first met, I came to your rescue each time you were in over your head. And,\u201d he continued when she started to protest, \u201cyou were in over your head. Even you know you would have been killed coming up against the numbers of vampires you did if I hadn\u2019t jumped into the fray and aided you.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI know. It\u2019s just galling to admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if Roland transformed you, our positions could very well reverse. You could be the one coming to my rescue when things got rough, because you would be stronger than I am.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head to one side. \u201cOkay, I won\u2019t lie. That does sound good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll consider it?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that I don\u2019t want to transform you myself. Because I do. I just want you to be safe and don\u2019t want my selfish desires to impede that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She still seemed disappointed.</p><p>Reaching up, he brushed her hair back from her face. \u201cWhy is it so important to you that I transform you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean told me how it\u2019s done and . . .\u201d She squeezed his hand. \u201cIf someone else\u2019s blood is going to flow through my body, I want it to be yours.\u201d</p><p>His hand tightened around her fragile fingers as his body went rock hard. \u201cWould you think me strange if I told you that turns me on?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cA little bit, but I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, he yanked her into his arms and fell backward onto the sheets.</p><p>She laughed as her hair fell down around them in a silky curtain, closing them off from the rest of the world.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the most incredible woman I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI find that hard to believe. You\u2019ve lived for two hundred years.\u201d And she wasn\u2019t fishing for compliments. She really didn\u2019t seem to understand her own worth, how unique and exceptional she was.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d he vowed. \u201cSometimes I fear this might all be a wonderful dream from which I will soon awaken.\u201d</p><p>She kissed his stubbled chin. \u201cIf it is, I don\u2019t want to wake up.\u201d</p><p>He hugged her close. \u201cI\u2019ve been lonely for so long, Krysta,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cI have, too,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited two hundred years for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope I can live up to your expectations,\u201d she murmured, brow furrowing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve already surpassed the fantasies and expectations I compiled over the decades and centuries.\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cYou don\u2019t want much, do you? Just a skinny girl to aggravate you every once in a while and put your life in danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t aggravate me, you entertain me. Endangering my life keeps me on my toes. And I don\u2019t know why you have issues with your body. The only issue I have with it is that it\u2019s clothed far too often.\u201d</p> <p>Laughing, she wrinkled her nose. \u201cI was mocked throughout high school for being flat-chested and spent four years watching every male except my fiancE, who was just my boyfriend back then, drool over all the girls with big boobs. So it\u2019s hard not to be self-conscious.\u201d Her face lit with an Ah-ha! expression. \u201cHey! When I\u2019m transformed, will the virus make me beautiful like Sarah, Lisette, Melanie, and Jenna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already are beautiful,\u201d he declared. He loved the way she looked.</p><p>She pouted. \u201cIt won\u2019t change my appearance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. If you were older, the virus would reverse the damage aging had wrought and make you young again.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cJenna seems very excited about her gray hair having turned brown again.\u201d</p> <p>He grinned. \u201cYes, she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it won\u2019t change my shape?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIf you were emaciated, the virus would rebuild the muscle mass you had lost, heal the damage done, and render you a healthy weight once more. If you were obese, the virus would swiftly burn through your fat stores\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. Heal the damage done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and render you a healthy weight. Since you\u2019re neither, there should be no noticeable difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo . . . no big boobs?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo big boobs. Not that you need them.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cIt just would have been nice to have an hourglass figure that wasn\u2019t achieved by wearing a stiff, uncomfortable push-up bra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer no bra to a push-up bra, at least around me,\u201d he mentioned.</p><p>\u201cYou are so easy to please,\u201d she said with a smile, wiggling from side to side atop him in a way that sent shocks of pleasure darting through him.</p><p>His voice deepened. \u201cAnd you please me endlessly.\u201d</p><p>Her look turned flirtatious. \u201cYou know, the rest of me may not be too much to brag about, but I do happen to have a lovely mouth.\u201d Lowering her lips to his chest, she tongued his nipple and delivered a love bite.</p><p>He hissed in a breath, pulse leaping. \u201cYes, you do.\u201d</p><p>She moved to the other nipple and repeated the gestures. \u201cA very talented mouth.\u201d</p> <p>Mmmm. \u201cDo tell.\u201d</p><p>She sent him a provocative smile. \u201cYou sound doubtful.\u201d</p><p>Etienne was surprised he could make any sound at all beyond a moan as she slid down his body, her satin skin teasing his cock, and kissed his belly.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps a demonstration is in order?\u201d she suggested innocently, dipping her tongue into his navel.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cA demonstration. Yes, please.\u201d</p><p>With a sultry laugh, she curled her fingers around the base of his shaft and gave the tip straining toward her a long lick.</p><p>Etienne groaned and buried his hands in her hair, fire igniting his blood as she circled him with her tongue, then drew him into her warm, wet, admittedly talented mouth.</p><p>Krysta hummed as a litany of French poured forth from Etienne\u2019s lips. He was beautiful, muscles rippling, head arching back, face flushing with pleasure. Pleasure that soon swept through her as she coaxed him toward a climax. Her breath shortened as she continued to tease and torment him with her lips and tongue and fingers. She was so wet. She could almost feel him inside her, thrusting deep.</p><p>Etienne suddenly released her hair and grabbed her arms. Dragging her up, he rolled her beneath him and plunged inside her.</p><p>Crying out, Krysta clamped her hands on his ass and drew him in deep, urging him on as he began to move, thrusting and withdrawing, rocking against her, hitting all the right spots.</p><p>\u201cLike it?\u201d he growled in her ear as he slid a hand to her breast and pinched her sensitive nipple.</p><p>She nodded, too breathless to speak. Yes.</p><p>\u201cWant more?\u201d</p><p>Again she nodded. Hell, yes.</p><p>He withdrew, rearing back onto his knees.</p><p>She opened her mouth to protest and gasped as, instead, he flipped her over onto her hands and knees, then plunged into her again, taking her from behind.</p><p>Oh, yeah!</p><p>A low laugh vibrated her back as he buried his lips in her hair, seeking and finding the base of her neck as he fondled her breasts with one hand and slid the other down over her stomach to delve into the curls beneath and stroke her clit.</p><p>Krysta never would have described herself as being noisy in bed until that moment. Sounds of pleasure emerged with every breath, every thrust, until a climax ripped through her, her body clenching and unclenching around his.</p><p>Etienne\u2019s grip tightened almost to the point of pain as he found his own release.</p><p>The two collapsed onto the sheets. Krysta barely had time to acknowledge just how heavy all of that muscle was before he rolled them to their sides and spooned around her.</p><p>Several minutes passed as they regained their breath. Little aftershocks of pleasure continued to dart through her. She didn\u2019t think she had ever had such an intense orgasm.</p><p>\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t even get to show you how talented my mouth is,\u201d he murmured into her hair.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cNext time.\u201d</p><p>Etienne felt a twinge of nerves as he dialed Seth\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Seth answered on the second ring. Once more, his voice was accompanied by the sounds of battle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Etienne. Are you busy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Etienne glanced at Krysta, who stared back with furrowed brow as she bit her lower lip. \u201cI wanted to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>A scream of pain rent the air in the background.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this isn\u2019t a bad time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on. Friedrich, haben Sie diese?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIch werde bald wiederkommen.\u201d Seth appeared beside Etienne, a bloody katana in one hand. He nodded a greeting to Krysta. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Etienne pocketed his phone. \u201cKrysta would like to be transformed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Etienne waited for him to say more.</p><p>The silence stretched as Seth stared at him expectantly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Etienne asked. \u201cJust . . . okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>More silence.</p><p>Etienne met Krysta\u2019s confused gaze, then looked at Seth. \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>Seth arched a brow. \u201cWhat\u2019s not to get? She wants to be transformed and I have no objection to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I guess I just thought that there was more to it than that. That you would want to read her mind or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormally, I would read her mind to ensure this was what she truly wanted rather than a hasty decision or that she wasn\u2019t being pressured into it. But I actually saw this coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Krysta took a step forward. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOccasionally I get glimpses of the future. Krysta becoming immortal was one of those glimpses, which is why I felt no guilt when I urged her in that direction by repeatedly pointing out that\u2014because she\u2019s mortal\u2014she\u2019s a liability.\u201d</p><p>Krysta frowned. \u201cI\u2019ve really come to hate that word.\u201d</p><p>Seth shrugged. \u201cDid it help you reach your decision more quickly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she grumbled, \u201cbut I still don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cAhhhh. She already sounds like an immortal.\u201d</p><p>Etienne laughed. \u201cWe\u2019re all a pain in your ass, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so. Now, if you will forgive me, I need to return to the battle before Friedrich is overrun.\u201d He bowed. \u201cWelcome to the family, Krysta. If you have any questions about the transformation, what will happen or how long it will take, I\u2019m sure Dr. Lipton would be happy to answer them for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said.</p><p>Etienne offered Seth his hand. \u201cYes. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Seth shook his hand and clapped him on the back, then vanished.</p><p>Etienne met Krysta\u2019s gaze. \u201cLooks like we have the go-ahead.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI expected there to be more to it, too. I thought we\u2019d have to plead our case or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth is an enigma.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head to one side. \u201cAre you sure he\u2019s an immortal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis aura is different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze roved him. \u201cYour aura is a combination of purple and white that swirls and mingles, but never blends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Is that different from vampires\u2019 auras?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cVampires\u2019 auras are orange. Human auras vary according to health and mood. Auras of immortals and vampires don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how is Seth\u2019s different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no purple. It\u2019s just pure white. Almost blindingly white. It\u2019s actually quite beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Etienne frowned. \u201cAll immortals have purple in their auras except for Seth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He pondered that a moment. He had never questioned it before. Seth had gifts like all of them. His eyes glowed when he was gripped by strong emotion like theirs did. He had fangs . . . didn\u2019t he?</p><p>Now that he thought about it, Etienne couldn\u2019t recall ever having seen any on the eldest immortal. \u201cDoes David\u2019s aura contain purple?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but only a sliver. I thought he was like Seth at first, then saw the purple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s just an age thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose so,\u201d she conceded. \u201cRoland has more white in his aura than you and Richart do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He relaxed. \u201cThat\u2019s it, then. And, speaking of Roland, would you like me to go ahead and give him a call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d She crossed to him and leaned into his side. \u201cI still wish it could be you.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her tempting lips. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>His call went straight to voice mail. \u201cRoland, it\u2019s Etienne. Give me a call when you receive this.\u201d He started to put his phone away, then paused. \u201cLet me try Sarah. Those two are rarely apart. Maybe Roland is just being his usual antisocial self and not answering because he doesn\u2019t want to talk to anyone.\u201d He dialed Sarah\u2019s number.</p> <p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi. It\u2019s Etienne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, with what sounded like false enthusiasm. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m trying to reach Roland. Is he there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm . . . no. He\u2019s . . .\u201d She lowered her voice to a whisper. \u201cHe\u2019s avoiding you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can hear you,\u201d Roland said in the background.</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d</p><p>Etienne frowned. \u201cWhy is he avoiding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s thinks you\u2019re going to ask him to transform Krysta.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am going to ask him to transform Krysta.\u201d</p><p>Roland\u2019s voice came over the phone. \u201cNot going to happen.\u201d</p><p>The line went dead.</p><p>Swearing, Etienne dialed her number again.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Sarah answered innocently, as though she didn\u2019t know who was calling.</p><p>\u201cPut him on,\u201d Etienne said.</p><p>Roland let loose a stream of epithets in the background.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m . . . not going to repeat that,\u201d Sarah said.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d Etienne told her. \u201cLook, I know he\u2019s antisocial, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t just that,\u201d she said, lowering her voice.</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe found out that . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he prodded.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cThe guys on theimmortalguardians.com website are calling him The Transformer. Like the robots.\u201d</p><p>More foul epithets from Roland. \u201cI will not be disrespected!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they don\u2019t mean it as an insult,\u201d Etienne lied. Roland wasn\u2019t a favorite amongst immortals because of his . . . personality and his tendency to terrorize any Seconds sent to serve him, so any gossip that concerned him on the website tended to be unflattering.</p><p>\u201cYes, they do,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m as furious as he is. Roland should be applauded for helping those he transformed, myself included, and the guys on the net are all being dicks about it.\u201d</p><p>Etienne\u2019s eyebrows flew up as Roland burst into laughter in the background.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sarah demanded. \u201cI can\u2019t curse? It pisses me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Etienne said, wondering how he could spin this and change Roland\u2019s mind. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think Krysta should have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing it,\u201d Roland insisted. \u201cThree is my limit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rustling sounded.</p><p>\u201cRoland,\u201d Sarah warned, her voice fading, \u201cdon\u2019t you dare smash my\u2014\u201d</p><p>The line went dead.</p><p>Etienne tucked his phone away. \u201cRoland isn\u2019t terribly enthusiastic about the idea.\u201d</p><p>Stepping back, Krysta smiled and shrugged. \u201cThen it\u2019ll be you after all. Good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me one more chance to win him over. Everyone has been sticking pretty close to David\u2019s when they aren\u2019t hunting. We can go by there later and see if I can\u2019t change his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to have any luck. Everyone I talk to says Roland is as stubborn as a mule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re right. But Seth and David will be there and might urge him along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll buy Sarah a new phone as a peace offering,\u201d he mused.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to her old one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Roland just destroyed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Good luck changing his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Roland,\u201d Etienne urged. \u201cDo it for me.\u201d</p><p>Leaning against the bar that separated David\u2019s dining room and kitchen, Roland crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cAnd I owe you what?\u201d</p><p>Richart, Jenna, Lisette, Tracy, Sheldon, and Cam formed a horseshoe around them. Ethan, Edward, Yuri, Stanislov, and their four Seconds stood just behind them and watched over their shoulders.</p><p>Etienne swore silently. \u201cThen do it for Krysta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I owe her what?\u201d</p><p>Patience fraying, Etienne gestured to Jenna and Richart. \u201cYou turned Jenna for Richart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI turned Jenna because she\u2019s my descendant.\u201d</p><p>Cam looked at Jenna and Richart. \u201cIs that why Richart keeps calling you Gramps?\u201d</p><p>Roland glared daggers at Richart.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know Krysta isn\u2019t your descendant?\u201d Etienne asked. It was a stretch, but . . .</p><p>\u201cBecause I keep track of them,\u201d Roland responded.</p><p>Sarah stood sentinel beside her husband and frowned at their audience. \u201cYou see? I told you he has a big heart. He\u2019s been watching over them all this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeeping track isn\u2019t the same as watching over them,\u201d Roland murmured.</p><p>Sarah elbowed him. \u201cGive me my moment, honey. I\u2019m defending you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>\u201cRoland,\u201d Etienne said, \u201cyou must understand my position. I want Krysta to be as strong as possible so she\u2019ll be as safe as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an Immortal Guardian,\u201d Roland said, unmoved. \u201cI hunt and destroy vampires. I am not a transformer.\u201d</p><p>A few snickers sounded.</p><p>Etienne growled in frustration and dragged his hands through his hair.</p><p>Marcus smiled and shook his head as he looked at the immortals around him. \u201cI told you not to fuck with him. What if you\u2019re the next one who falls in love with a gifted one? Wouldn\u2019t you want him to transform her, as Etienne does, so she would be stronger and safer? You all just screwed yourselves for a laugh.\u201d</p><p>That sobered them up. As many immortals as there had been falling in love lately, it wasn\u2019t out of the realm of possibility.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>Roland\u2019s head snapped around. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll do it. I\u2019m as strong and as fast as you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d Sheldon exclaimed, drawing everyone\u2019s gaze. \u201cChick-on-chick action!\u201d</p><p>Cam popped him on the back of the head.</p><p>Etienne rolled his eyes and returned his attention to Sarah. \u201cI appreciate the offer, but you aren\u2019t a healer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right. I was thinking of the strength part and forgot it might be because he\u2019s a powerful healer.\u201d</p><p>Seth and David entered from the kitchen, carrying huge platters of baked cornish hens and filling the room with a mouthwateringly delicious aroma.</p><p>Etienne abandoned trying to convince Roland and turned to Seth. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you transform her, Seth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He placed the platter on the ever-growing dining table and turned to face them. \u201cNor can David.\u201d</p><p>David nodded as he did the same.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re older and more powerful than all of you,\u201d Seth reminded him. \u201cWe don\u2019t know which of those factors\u2014age or being a powerful healer\u2014causes immortals turned by Roland to be stronger than expected. However, since David and I possess both, chances are excellent that Krysta would be as strong and as powerful as we are if one of us transformed her.\u201d</p><p>Sarah arched an eyebrow. \u201cSo? What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d</p><p>Jenna crossed her arms over her chest and nodded, chin rising.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even go there,\u201d Seth said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a misogynistic thing. I don\u2019t know a single immortal male who isn\u2019t drawn to strong women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYourself included?\u201d Sarah asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hear that, ladies?\u201d she said, a speculative gleam entering her eyes. \u201cWe need to find Seth a good, strong woman.\u201d</p><p>The women responded with amusing enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cDo you like your women tall or short?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlender or full-figured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll have to be a gifted one, so she can be transformed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr an immortal. There are other female immortals, aren\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I bet we could get Chris to give us a list of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe we could ask around on the website. Is there a Personals section on the website? We could post a single and looking for ad for him.\u201d</p><p>Seth turned a little green and looked to their husbands. \u201cUm . . . a little help?\u201d</p><p>The men raised their hands in a What can we do? It\u2019s out of our hands gesture.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Seth hurried to interrupt them. \u201cWe can\u2019t have a youngster running around with the power we wield. I know we make it look easy, but David and I have had thousands of years to accustom ourselves to it and learn control.\u201d</p><p>Etienne sighed. So much for Krysta being as strong as possible. He met her gaze and found excitement rather than disappointment there.</p><p>\u201cLooks like it\u2019s going to be you,\u201d she said with a grin, adding several tiny hand claps. \u201cYay!\u201d</p><p>He laughed and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll let you choose the time and place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d David spoke up, \u201cyou should do it here, where I can be available to assist you.\u201d</p><p>Sarah nodded. \u201cHe helped me when I transformed. I don\u2019t remember much about it beyond being submerged in a bathtub full of ice and water with Roland and seeing David leaning over me, but I know he helped me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Krysta bit her lip. \u201cHow bad does this whole transformation thing get?\u201d</p><p>Sarah came forward and stood next to her. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you all about it after dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>The front door opened. Bastien, Melanie, and Sean entered.</p><p>Etienne took Krysta\u2019s hand. \u201cYou really aren\u2019t disappointed?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and squeezed his hand. \u201cYou know why I wanted it to be you.\u201d</p><p>He did. And recalling it made him hard again, so he hurriedly escorted her to the table, where everyone gathered around to enjoy the sumptuous meal Seth and David had miraculously found time to prepare.</p><p>Chapter 16</p> <p>As the meal drew to a close, Seth looked around the table. \u201cSeconds, and Sean, I\u2019d like you to leave us for a few moments. Please adjourn to the training room. You\u2019ll find a selection of desserts and refreshments awaiting you. Spar. Gorge. Gossip. Do whatever makes you happy. We\u2019ll let you know when our business here is concluded.\u201d</p><p>Surprised looks were exchanged all around. Immortals visually consulted each other and found no answers as the Seconds rose, pushed their chairs close to the table, and headed for the hallway without comment.</p><p>Ami rose.</p><p>Seth touched her arm. \u201cI\u2019d like you to stay, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Swallowing hard, she retook her seat.</p><p>Marcus wrapped an arm around her shoulders and drew her close.</p> <p>Jenna cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what I should do here. I\u2019m immortal, but I don\u2019t hunt vampires yet, so . . . should I leave or stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, stay,\u201d David said. \u201cYour input will be particularly important in the matter we wish to discuss.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows shot up. \u201cReally?\u201d She glanced at Richart, who shrugged.</p><p>\u201cKrysta,\u201d Seth added. \u201cYou\u2019ll be immortal within the week, so you may stay as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarnell, you stay, too,\u201d David continued.</p><p>Darnell nodded, then called to the others, \u201cClose the doors to the basement and the training room so we won\u2019t have to listen to Sheldon get his ass kicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, ha ha,\u201d Sheldon said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \u201cWait. You meant in a sparring session, right?\u201d</p><p>Cam nudged him along.</p> <p>Etienne wondered what the hell was going on. Seth had never done this before. Seconds were always privy to the business of immortals. They needed to be aware of every threat in order to better serve and protect them. What could Seth not want them to know?</p><p>The door to the basement closed. Boots tromped down stairs. The door to the training room closed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think is going on?\u201d he heard Sheldon ask.</p><p>\u201cThey can hear you, genius,\u201d Cam reminded him.</p><p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d</p><p>Richart sighed and rolled his eyes.</p><p>Soon conversation began to flow below. Movies. Books. The latest goings-on at the network.</p><p>Here at the table no one spoke.</p><p>The tension rose. All present, like Etienne, believed an ax was about to fall.</p><p>At last, Seth spoke. \u201cA situation has arisen. Something unprecedented. Something that has left even David and I uncertain how to proceed.\u201d</p><p>Roland shifted slightly. \u201cI thought you two had seen and done it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did we. What we discuss here will remain between those seated at this table. Do not share this with your Seconds or with any other mortal members of the network. Torture will not extract this information from immortals. It will, however, draw it from most mortals. Considering the many enemies we have faced in the last few years, we cannot take that risk.\u201d</p><p>All nodded.</p><p>What the hell was Seth going to tell them?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve misled you. I did it intentionally for the reason I just disclosed. I have kept from you a secret that was not my own to share and intended to keep it from you longer, but circumstances have eliminated any further hope of maintaining silence.\u201d</p><p>Roland leaned forward. \u201cAny secret you share with us will be guarded with our lives. Should anyone here betray you, I will take care of him or her myself.\u201d</p><p>The pledge may have surprised everyone present, but none doubted the veracity of it. Roland may be antisocial and grumble, but he could be ruthless when defending a loved one and was a man any warrior would feel fortunate to have guarding his back.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>A faint thumping began to distract Etienne. It took him a moment to realize it was the heel of Ami\u2019s boot striking the floor as her knee bobbed up and down.</p><p>She stilled as everyone looked at her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m nervous.\u201d</p><p>Marcus glared daggers at everyone.</p><p>Hell. This was going to be big, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cAs you know, Ami was a primary target of Emrys, who gained knowledge of her association with us through Montrose Keegan, then passed that knowledge along to Donald and Nelson.\u201d</p><p>All nodded.</p><p>\u201cBecause mercenaries who may be linked to Donald and Nelson\u2019s group have risen against us, I feel compelled to explain why it is more important than ever that we keep Ami out of their hands.\u201d</p><p>It was unusual to order immortals to risk their lives to protect Seconds instead of the other way around. Immortals were very rare in the greater scheme of things, so the loss of even one had great impact.</p><p>Richart frowned. \u201cWhy did they want her so badly before? Did they find out she\u2019s a gifted one?\u201d</p><p>Seth leaned forward. \u201cAmi is not a gifted one. She\u2019s an extraterrestrial.\u201d</p><p>Etienne stared at him blankly.</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t the only one.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s from another planet,\u201d Seth clarified.</p><p>Dead silence.</p><p>Ami nibbled her lower lip. Marcus . . . was preparing to kill them all by the looks of his darkening features.</p><p>\u201cThat is so cool,\u201d Krysta said, daring to speak first.</p><p>Etienne glanced over and found her staring at Ami with a combination of awe and delight.</p><p>\u201cWhat planet are you from?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Across from Ami, Sarah nodded. \u201cAre you from Jupiter? Because I\u2019ve always wanted to know what\u2019s at the center of that big-ass storm.\u201d</p><p>Some of the anxiety left Ami\u2019s face, replaced by a tentative smile. \u201cNo, I\u2019m from a planet called Lasara in another solar system. But I can tell you what\u2019s in the storm on Jupiter.\u201d</p><p>Seth held up a hand. \u201cLet\u2019s save that for later.\u201d</p><p>Roland leaned forward. \u201cAre there others from your world here?\u201d His gaze remained on Marcus, though he spoke to Ami.</p><p>If either immortal were telepathic, Etienne would swear the two were silently communicating.</p><p>Then again, they had known each other for eight hundred years. Speech may no longer be necessary.</p><p>Ami shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill there be others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Etienne felt Krysta tug his hand and listened to her thoughts.</p><p>She\u2019s all alone? Do you think she crashed?</p><p>I don\u2019t know.</p><p>A slew of questions leapt from lips all around the table.</p><p>David cleared his throat. \u201cYour questions can wait. And, if Ami isn\u2019t comfortable answering them, I trust none of you will press her.\u201d</p><p>In other words, leave her the hell alone. Message received. Ami wasn\u2019t comfortable discussing her origins. Not surprising, considering she had been tortured by the humans who had captured her. Or, at least, he assumed Emrys and his men had captured her.</p><p>That also explained why they had pretty much dissected her, taking advantage of her regenerative capabilities to learn everything they could about her alien race, the bastards.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d Seth said, face somber.</p><p>More?</p><p>Everyone gave him their full attention.</p><p>\u201cAmi is pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Several immortals gasped.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s face lit up. \u201cOh, my gosh! Congratulations!\u201d She started to jump up, intending to run around the table and embrace the couple, but Roland stopped her.</p><p>Etienne peeked at her thoughts and caught her confusion, then her understanding.</p><p>Krysta squeezed his hand. Is this as bad as I think it is?</p><p>Yes. He felt for Marcus. No wonder he had been so tense lately.</p><p>They don\u2019t know how the virus will affect the baby?</p><p>Right.</p><p>Or what will happen with the whole human and alien DNA combining thing?</p><p>Gifted one and alien DNA. Yes.</p><p>\u201cJenna,\u201d Melanie said. \u201cYou\u2019re the only immortal we know of who has ever had a baby, so I would appreciate your input as I guide Ami through her pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>Jenna nodded. \u201cOf course. I don\u2019t know how much help I\u2019ll be though.\u201d</p><p>Bastien spoke up. \u201cDid you cramp when you were pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Throughout most of the pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow severe were the cramps?\u201d he pressed.</p><p>She thought for a moment. \u201cThey were like mild menstrual cramps. In fact, for the first two weeks I was pregnant, I kept thinking I was about to get my period and didn\u2019t realize I was pregnant. So they were more annoying than painful. Nothing that would make me reach for pain relievers or anything.\u201d She grimaced and glanced around the table. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Is that too much information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Bastien turned to Melanie and raised his eyebrows.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI know. I know. You\u2019re brilliant.\u201d Bastien brilliant? Must be an inside joke. \u201cThank you, Jenna.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Jenna turned to Ami. \u201cCongratulations, Ami. How bad is the nausea?\u201d</p><p>Ami grimaced. \u201cPretty bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you made it through dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI almost didn\u2019t. The smell of most food tends to make me gag.\u201d</p><p>Jenna nodded. \u201cI was the same way. I threw up half a dozen times a day sometimes in my early weeks.\u201d</p><p>Some of Marcus\u2019s tension eased. \u201cThat\u2019s normal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. It\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Ami infected with the virus?\u201d Roland interrupted.</p><p>Marcus met his gaze once more. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Melanie shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve found no trace of it in her blood.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf she were infected,\u201d Roland asked, \u201cwould she turn immortal or vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have no way of knowing,\u201d Seth answered.</p><p>Somber stares all around. So she couldn\u2019t be transformed.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re worrying about me growing old, dying, and leaving Marcus alone in a few decades . . .\u201d Ami began.</p><p>Yes, they were. Marcus had come very close to the edge after losing a woman he had loved for eight centuries. Like Etienne, everyone present feared what losing Ami would do to him.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t,\u201d she continued. \u201cMy race is very long-lived. It will take me centuries just to get my first gray hair.\u201d</p><p>Their time together would still be finite, but at least they would have centuries rather than decades.</p><p>\u201cAmi and the baby are both doing well,\u201d Seth announced. Thus far went unspoken. \u201cI trust you understand now why I want Ami to be protected at all costs?\u201d</p> <p>Everyone nodded. This was unprecedented. Etienne didn\u2019t remember ever having heard of an immortal female giving birth or an immortal male fathering a child with a mortal. And he would have heard it if it had happened.</p><p>\u201cThen you also understand why she will not be aiding us in tracking down the mercenaries this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Roland voiced, and glared at everyone else until they nodded or said the same.</p><p>Antisocial, but loyal. Roland was going to be protective as hell of that baby once it was born.</p><p>If it was born.</p><p>Etienne silently prayed that all would be well with Ami\u2019s pregnancy and that she would give birth to a healthy babe. She had suffered tremendously at the hands of Emrys and his doctors. He hated to think of her suffering more.</p> <p>Seth thanked them for their discretion and for forgiving his deception. (It had been Seth who had told them all Ami was a gifted one.) He then wished them all happy hunting.</p><p>Every immortal present, save Seth and David, hugged Marcus and Ami and congratulated them before seeking out their Seconds.</p><p>Etienne hugged Ami, then Marcus, slapping him on the back.</p><p>Krysta smiled down at Ami. \u201cAre you having any weird cravings? Can we pick something up for you while we\u2019re out hunting?\u201d</p><p>Etienne\u2019s chest swelled with what he could no longer deny was love for her.</p><p>Ami smiled and shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve really been having a hard time keeping anything down. Anything but lollipops, that is. They seem to be the only sweets I can tolerate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLollipops it is,\u201d Krysta promised with a smile.</p><p>Etienne and Krysta moved away as Jenna hugged Ami and started to chat her up.</p> <p>\u201cWhen do you want me to transform you?\u201d he asked as they sought out Cam to let him know they were leaving.</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d she asked hopefully.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s let David know before we leave.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, calling good hunting to those within, Etienne and Krysta stepped out into the night. As they crossed to his car, Etienne glimpsed Roland and Marcus within the shadows of the forest that surrounded the drive.</p><p>Roland dragged Marcus into a rough hug.</p><p>Marcus\u2019s hands clenched into fists on Roland\u2019s back, knuckles showing white. His mind was full of what-ifs. And all were terrifying.</p><p>Roland\u2019s mind was full of the same, along with a heavy dose of concern for his friend and . . . guilt. Roland was keeping something from him.</p><p>Etienne frowned. Who the hell was Zach? And what did he have to do with Ami and Lisette?</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want to hunt tonight?\u201d Krysta asked, unaware that they weren\u2019t alone.</p><p>Etienne hastily looked away from the duo before Roland could catch him staring. Opening the car door, he waited for Krysta to slide inside. \u201cLet\u2019s try UNCG.\u201d Lisette had been hunting there of late.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s pick up Ami\u2019s lollipops on the way so we won\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He closed the door. Strolling around to the driver\u2019s side, he glanced at the forest and discovered the elder immortals were gone.</p><p>They only encountered three vampires that night. All were insane. So all were destroyed.</p><p>Etienne was unharmed in the brief battle. Krysta barely earned a scratch. Yet they both bore their fair share of bloodstains when they returned to David\u2019s home and claimed what Etienne called a quiet room in the basement.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a quiet room?\u201d she asked, checking it out.</p><p>\u201cA room that has been so thoroughly soundproofed that the other immortals in the house won\u2019t be able to hear anything that transpires within it.\u201d</p><p>Good to know.</p><p>\u201cSo. How are we going to do this?\u201d Krysta asked, beginning to feel a bit anxious now that the time of her transformation was at hand. Guilty, too, because she hadn\u2019t told Sean of their plans for fear he would spend hours trying to talk her out of it.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s wash the blood and sweat off first,\u201d Etienne suggested and peeled off his coat.</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d Krysta removed her own coat.</p><p>Minutes passed as they disarmed.</p><p>She grinned and shook her head as the pile of weapons they stacked on the nearby love seat grew. \u201cWe\u2019re quite a pair, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>He winked. \u201cPerfect for each other.\u201d</p><p>She agreed wholeheartedly.</p><p>Her breath caught as he drew his shirt over his head.</p><p>All that muscle . . .</p><p>His long fingers dropped to the zipper of his pants.</p><p>Krysta hurriedly yanked her own shirt over her head so she wouldn\u2019t miss anything.</p><p>He slid the zipper down. Tucking his thumbs in the waistband, he peeled off the pants and his boxers and kicked them aside.</p><p>Her heart beat faster.</p><p>He was already hard.</p><p>\u201cWaiting for anything in particular?\u201d he asked innocently.</p><p>Grinning, she pulled her sports bra off and let it fall to the floor. \u201cHave I mentioned how much I love it when your eyes glow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he murmured, his luminous amber gaze devouring her as she unfastened her pants and slid them down to her ankles, along with her bikini panties. \u201cDamn, you tempt me.\u201d</p><p>Good. Because she couldn\u2019t wait to feel him inside her again.</p><p>Groaning, he closed his eyes for a moment, then turned and strode into the bathroom.</p><p>As she followed him, she heard the faucet give a faint squeak. Steam poured from the shower as she entered the sleek room.</p><p>Immortal Guardians must have a thing for bathrooms, because this one, like those in Etienne\u2019s home, was as gorgeous as a millionaire\u2019s spa.</p><p>Tugging the elastic band from the end of her braid, she untwined her hair and finger-combed it while she admired Etienne\u2019s gorgeous form.</p><p>He held his hand out to her.</p><p>Smiling in anticipation, she took it and stepped into the granite-tiled shower more than big enough for two.</p><p>Steam encapsulated and caressed them as he slid the glass door closed. Drawing her up against him, Etienne stepped back into the fountain of water and let it flow over them like hands.</p><p>Krysta touched his shoulders, drew her fingers down his slick chest as he tilted his head back.</p><p>Water turned his hair into a sleek, black cap, straight and soft and shiny against his handsome face. Reversing their positions, he settled his hands low on her spine.</p><p>Krysta arched her back and reached up to run her fingers through her hair as the warm water swiftly saturated it.</p><p>Etienne pressed his hips into hers, sliding his hard cock between her parted thighs and sending shocks of pleasure through her.</p><p>Her breath caught. She lowered her chin and met his gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful, Krysta.\u201d</p><p>Abandoning her hair, she gripped his biceps. \u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>He leaned closer.</p><p>Anticipation rose as she focused on his lips.</p><p>He drew back, a bar of soap and two washcloths in his hand.</p><p>Had he just been reaching past her?</p><p>\u201cTease,\u201d she grumbled as he stepped back, breaking all contact.</p><p>He laughed. But that glowing gaze continued to roam her as he lathered up one of the cloths and handed it to her.</p><p>Krysta took it and began to vigorously scrub one arm, removing splotches of blood as she watched him lather up the other cloth and return the soap to the dish behind her.</p><p>\u201cSlower,\u201d he instructed, voice silky smooth.</p><p>She paused.</p><p>Etienne kept his eyes on Krysta, focusing on her exquisite, expressive face as he drew his soapy cloth down one arm in long, leisurely strokes, then up again.</p><p>Hunger flared in her gaze as she watched the motion, then mimicked it herself, slowing her movements to sensual strokes.</p><p>He smiled, hard and aching and loving the suspense, loving having to wait, loving making her wait, knowing how explosive it would be when they finally joined.</p><p>He drew the cloth down over his other arm.</p><p>Krysta did the same.</p><p>He slid it down his side, over his hip and down one leg.</p><p>Krysta continued to follow his lead, her gaze frequently skipping to the erection that strained toward her.</p><p>Up one leg, then down the other. Then back up the leg and his other side. He slid the cloth over his chest, dragging the material over his nipples and imagining it was her hands.</p><p>Krysta did the same, gasping and biting her lip.</p><p>He dropped his cloth. She dropped hers and took a step toward him.</p><p>Etienne shook his head. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>She stopped and stared as he slid his soapy hands over his chest. Then she cupped her breasts in soapy hands and squeezed them with a moan.</p><p>His pulse raced. For a moment he forgot to move.</p><p>Her hips shifted restlessly as she continued to fondle her breasts, stroking, squeezing, and pinching the hard, pink tips. Then she slid one hand down her flat stomach.</p><p>Etienne slid a hand down his own.</p><p>Her fingers brushed the dark thatch of hair at the juncture of her thighs.</p><p>His fingers brushed his.</p><p>She widened her stance.</p><p>His body caught fire.</p><p>She slid those delicate fingers between her legs and moaned again as she stroked the nub hidden there.</p><p>Etienne fisted his cock, heart pounding against his ribs as he drew his hand down the long length and squeezed the sensitive tip.</p><p>She eased back a step. Water struck the back of her neck and sluiced down over her shoulders, rinsing the soap away and making her skin gleam as she continued to squeeze and massage one breast while stroking herself between her legs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She rubbed and circled and pinched her clit, breath coming quick, as her eyes met his. Her hand slid lower. Arching against her palm, she thrust two fingers inside her warm, wet sheath.</p><p>His hand tightened on his cock.</p><p>\u201cThis is where I want you,\u201d Krysta whispered, withdrawing her fingers, then thrusting them inside again, imagining it was him.</p> <p>Etienne\u2019s eyes flashed an even brighter amber.</p><p>\u201cOnly you,\u201d she murmured, need rising. \u201cSo long and hard and thick.\u201d</p><p>Muttering something in French, he blurred.</p><p>Krysta heard the shower door open, became weightless, then found herself in bed on her back in seconds. Etienne loomed over her, no longer soapy. Muscles bunching, he settled himself between her thighs, then thrust inside her.</p><p>Pure pleasure.</p> <p>Krysta cried out as he buried himself deep, then withdrew and thrust again. And again. And again. Reaching down, she grabbed his ass and urged him on, arching up against him, moaning with every breath.</p><p>He cupped the breast she had neglected in one large hand, squeezing and caressing and doing all of the things she had been imagining when she had touched herself.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d he growled.</p><p>I need you, too, she thought, so breathless she couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>Fire burned through her. She arched against him. Over and over. So good.</p><p>His lips teased the sensitive skin of her neck.</p> <p>Do it, she urged him.</p><p>He reached down between their bodies, sought the source of her pleasure.</p><p>An orgasm ripped through her, wringing a cry from her lips as her muscles tightened and her body clenched around his cock.</p><p>Pain followed as his fangs pierced her neck.</p><p>Krysta\u2019s hands clenched, her nails digging into his flesh.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, he thought.</p><p>She forced herself to loosen her hold and tried to relax into it. It\u2019s okay.</p><p>He continued to move inside her with slow thrusts. His fingers went to work once more, stroking her clit and sending sparks of renewed pleasure dancing through her.</p> <p>Her breath caught.</p><p>Yeah. That helped.</p><p>He thrust harder, squeezed her breast.</p><p>That helped a lot.</p><p>She felt him smile against her.</p><p>The pain continued. But he fed the pleasure, building it until she was once more thrusting and straining against him.</p><p>Another orgasm swept through her.</p><p>Cold began to seep in. As did weariness.</p><p>As darkness closed in, she thought she heard him say, I love you.</p><p>Krysta woke to the feeling of being watched. Frowning, she opened her eyes, then jumped when she found Etienne lying inches away, staring at her intently.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that!\u201d she said, heart racing. \u201cYou startled me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to. It took you longer to regain consciousness than I expected and I was worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>She lay there for a moment, taking stock of things. \u201cI don\u2019t feel any different.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, he brushed her hair, still damp from their shower, back from her face. \u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t kidding. Within hours she felt like she had a really bad case of the flu. Nausea. Vomiting. (Etienne was a little miffed when she wouldn\u2019t let him hold her hair for her, but she did not want him to watch her puke. Gross.) Fever. The worst headache she had ever had in her life.</p><p>For someone who hadn\u2019t been sick himself in over two centuries, Etienne was surprisingly helpful. He brought her hand-squeezed orange juice mixed with club soda to settle her stomach. Crackers and salty pita chips, too. He kept her supplied with ice packs for her head and a wide selection of DVDs to keep her entertained while the virus raged through her.</p><p>He told her stories of his youth. Stories of his immortality.</p><p>He even admitted that he and his twin had once wagered over which one of them could go the longest without sex.</p><p>\u201cNo sex at all?\u201d she asked, fever making it feel like flames were pouring from her eyes.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cNo sex. No pleasuring oneself. Nothing but cold showers. It was the longest thirty-two years of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-two years!\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his smile wry.</p><p>\u201cWho won?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither. It was a draw. Lisette found out why we had been so pissy, as she put it, and told us to cut the crap and get laid or she\u2019d tell Seth it was distracting us when we hunted.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWhat would Seth have done?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cHonestly, I have no idea.\u201d</p><p>The room began to spin. Her stomach turned over.</p><p>She closed her eyes and hoped it would calm. The whole vomiting thing was getting old.</p><p>\u201cKrysta.\u201d</p><p>Had Etienne just said her name? She tried to pry her eyelids open, but couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Krysta, darling, please wake up.</p><p>Wake up? She wasn\u2019t asleep. She had just closed her eyes for a second.</p><p>Cold needles pricked her skin. Pain pierced her. Everywhere.</p><p>Screaming, Krysta finally managed to open her eyes and found herself in a bathtub full of ice and water with Etienne at her back.</p><p>Etienne ignored the cold stinging his skin and locked his arms around Krysta, holding her tight as she fought to get out of the tub.</p><p>Melanie and David emptied more bags of ice into the water.</p><p>Tears threatened as Etienne subdued Krysta. Tears of relief. He had thought he had lost her. He had been talking to her, telling her about that stupid bet, and she had lost consciousness.</p><p>There had been no dreams or thought. Her breathing had become shallow.</p><p>David had sensed his panic and come to check on her. Melanie had followed. The alarm that had crossed her face when she had taken Krysta\u2019s temperature had scared the hell out of him.</p><p>Krysta\u2019s struggles slowed. Her breath came in pained pants.</p><p>Etienne could regulate his body temperature enough to warm her, but that would defeat the purpose. I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>She didn\u2019t think an answer to him. Etienne wasn\u2019t even sure she was lucid.</p><p>Then one of her hands\u2014shaking violently\u2014rose, clasped one of the arms he had clamped around her, and gave it a light squeeze.</p><p>Eyes burning, he dipped his head and buried his face in her hair.</p><p>\u201cCould I just say again that this is awesome?\u201d Krysta asked as they strolled, hand in hand, through UNC\u2019s campus in Chapel Hill.</p><p>Etienne laughed. \u201cWhich part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of it. Being so strong and fast. Being able to see so much. I can\u2019t believe I can walk around in the dark without a flashlight now.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, he shook his head. She had been immortal for a couple of weeks now and had made the adjustment beautifully. She wasn\u2019t even squeamish about infusing herself with blood, though he suspected that would have been vastly different if she actually had to drink it.</p><p>\u201cI can hear everything,\u201d she marveled. \u201cWhich can be kinda creepy. I\u2019ve never paid much attention to wildlife, so I don\u2019t know what animals are making the sounds I keep hearing and I\u2019m hearing a lot of sounds. And the smells . . . So many! Good and bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s heady, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt really is.\u201d She leaned into him and sent him a flirtatious look. \u201cYou smell very good, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose vampires,\u201d she said, \u201con the other hand, do not smell good. They smell like . . . old blood or rancid meat or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d He had caught their scent only seconds before she had. \u201cHow many are there?\u201d</p><p>Her nostrils flared as she drew in a deep breath. \u201cFour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one\u2019s harder.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cA mile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost two.\u201d</p><p>She swore. \u201cI\u2019m still having a hard time judging distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will become easier as you grow more accustomed to your heightened senses. The vamps are also traveling quickly, so that can throw you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like they\u2019re headed for Keenan Stadium. Let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t keep them from tearing it up for shits and giggles. That\u2019s a saying, right?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou can ease up on the slang now. We\u2019re together.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m too old for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. And, if I ever had\u2014which I didn\u2019t\u2014one night in bed with you would have convinced me otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinx. Don\u2019t arouse me before a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It might distract the vampires.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI guess it would. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Holding her hand, he sped toward UNC\u2019s football stadium.</p><p>Halfway there, he stopped short, jerking Krysta to a halt, too.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d she complained, rubbing her shoulder. \u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t hold hands when we run at preternatural speeds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me,\u201d he said absently, senses on high alert. He raised her hand to his lips. Do you smell that? Answer me with a thought.</p><p>She sniffed the air. Her brow furrowed. Is that . . . gun oil?</p><p>Yes. Let\u2019s head up to the roof. He motioned to the building beside them. Since she hadn\u2019t had much experience with jumping yet, he lifted her into his arms and nimbly leapt up onto the roof.</p><p>I really want to learn how to do that, she said as he lowered her feet to the asphalt.</p><p>Etienne pulled the infrared scope from his pocket and raised it to his right eye.</p><p>Is it mercenaries? she asked, scanning the darkened campus with her sharp brown eyes.</p><p>It took him a moment to confirm it. Yes. Even with the scope they\u2019re hard as hell to locate. There are two in the bushes there. He pointed. Two more on that roof nearly hidden by the air-conditioning unit. Another on that one. More on the ground. They must be wearing that camouflage netting I\u2019ve seen hunters wear. Without the scope, I can\u2019t differentiate them from the foliage.</p><p>Wow. These guys are determined. How many are there?</p><p>I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m seeing them all. There don\u2019t seem to be nearly as many as the last time. Maybe a dozen.</p><p>He drew her over into the shadows beside the air-conditioning unit and handed her the scope. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve spotted us yet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So, what\u2019s the plan? she asked as she peered through it. What are we supposed to do with them? Wait. What\u2019s that clicking noise?</p><p>Shh. He listened. Counted the clicks until they stopped. What time is it?</p><p>She consulted her watch. 3:00 AM.</p> <p>They must have been ordered to check in at the top of every hour. They were clicking their walkies to give a head count and let their leader know they\u2019re still in position and that all is well.</p><p>How many clicks were there?</p><p>A dozen.</p><p>Why do you think there are so few?</p><p>I don\u2019t know, and we\u2019ve run out of time to speculate. The vamps are almost here and we can\u2019t let the mercenaries get them.</p> <p>What do you want to do?</p><p>He needed to read the minds of the soldiers before he killed them to ensure none possessed any information. The current assumption was that they wouldn\u2019t. But he wasn\u2019t comfortable with letting the opportunity go by. And then there were the tracking devices he and Krysta both carried. You take care of the vampires.</p><p>Her eyebrows flew up. Really? You trust me to do it by myself?</p><p>You could handle those boys with your hands tied behind your back, he said proudly.</p><p>Don\u2019t you want to read their minds first to see if any are worth recruiting?</p><p>They aren\u2019t. They\u2019re broadcasting as loudly as a bloody boom mobile and I\u2019m getting nothing but depravity. Go get \u2019em, Tiger.</p> <p>Are you trying to use slang again or is that a new pet name for me?</p><p>Both? I thought, as a warrior, you might want something more fierce than sweetheart.</p><p>Rising up onto her toes, she brushed his lips with hers. I like sweetheart.</p><p>And I love you. Go do your thing.</p><p>She drew her swords and grinned. Will do.</p><p>There\u2019s just one more thing . . .</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Krysta confronted the vampires in the shadows where trees and buildings blocked the view of the mercenaries on the rooftops. Only one mercenary lurked nearby, tucked in the bushes several yards away.</p> <p>Etienne wasn\u2019t kidding about the camouflage. If he hadn\u2019t told her the mercenary was there, then shown her with the scope, she wouldn\u2019t have known it. Even his scent had been dampened so much that it was nearly undetectable.</p><p>The vampires stopped short when she halted in front of them.</p><p>Yeah. These guys weren\u2019t right. Their eyes were glowing and she hadn\u2019t even confronted them. Their longish hair was unkempt and greasy. Their clothing looked and smelled as though it hadn\u2019t been changed in days and carried the odors of multiple blood types. Their breath alone could kill a person.</p><p>Gross. She did not want to know what\u2014or whom\u2014they had been eating.</p><p>Breathing through her mouth, she watched them take in her presence, her weapons. They presented an interesting contrast. Two of them constantly fidgeted and twitched. The other two stood deathly still, like twisted mannequins.</p><p>The last was a little creepy.</p><p>Don\u2019t underestimate the still ones. They\u2019ll be as fast as the others, Etienne spoke in her head.</p><p>You just do what you have to do and leave these clowns to me, she ordered.</p><p>They didn\u2019t ask if she was an Immortal Guardian. They just attacked.</p><p>Krysta began to swing her swords. Her new speed, coupled with her ability to see their auras and anticipate their actions, made it seem as though they moved in slow motion. She struck with such unerring accuracy that they didn\u2019t have a chance.</p><p>Don\u2019t get cocky, Etienne warned.</p><p>I think you\u2019ve said that before.</p><p>She killed them all with an ease that astonished her, earning only the most superficial of wounds herself.</p><p>The mercenary there in the bushes will try to tranq you now, Etienne warned. Act swiftly.</p><p>Sheathing her weapons, she raced toward the bushes in a zigzag pattern.</p><p>Sure enough, a damned dart shot past her, nearly nicking her ear.</p><p>Reaching through the foliage, she knocked the tranq gun from the mercenary\u2019s hands, seemingly by accident, and yanked him out into the open.</p><p>He was younger than she had expected. Sean\u2019s age. Maybe less. For some reason she had thought he would be older. Face rough-hewn and hard. Skin lined and leathery from too many hours in the sun.</p><p>This guy\u2019s skin was smooth and clean-shaven.</p><p>Eyes wide, he reached for the tactical knife on his belt.</p><p>Krysta knocked it from his grasp and, clutching the front of his shirt with one hand, yanked him close. So close the automatic rifle hooked to the strap around his neck was forced to the side and back, out of reach.</p><p>\u201cRun,\u201d she ordered, calling upon all of her high school drama class lessons to present a facade of fear.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked as he pried at her hand.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d She unobtrusively planted a tracking device on his rifle, then grasped his shirt with both hands and shook. \u201cWhile you still have a chance. He\u2019s coming. He\u2019ll kill you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of them!\u201d he spat, unable to break her hold.</p><p>\u201cI was turned against my will.\u201d She wished she could squeeze out a few tears, but wasn\u2019t that good an actress. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Etienne demanded behind her.</p><p>The mercenary\u2019s fear magnified as he looked over her shoulder.</p><p>Krysta released her hold on the mercenary and moved to his side.</p><p>When he gripped his rifle, she stayed him. \u201cDon\u2019t. You\u2019ll just piss him off. Run!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d Etienne demanded. Remember what I told you. Give it your all. He has to think it\u2019s real. He charged toward her.</p><p>Heart stopping with dread, Krysta drew back her fist and swung with all of her preternatural might. Pain shot up her arm as her fist hit his jaw.</p><p>Etienne, with all of the flair of a stuntman in a freaking action-adventure blow-\u2019em-up movie, flew backward and struck the wall of the building behind him with a grunt, then collapsed to the ground.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d she shouted at the mercenary, who gaped first at Etienne and then at Krysta.</p><p>He reached for the walkie on his shoulder.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re all dead. I heard him kill them. It\u2019s why he left me to fend for myself with those monsters who attacked me.\u201d</p><p>He tried the walkie anyway and got nothing, his panic palpable.</p><p>Etienne rose with a groan, eyes glowing with what the mercenary no doubt took for promised retribution, but Krysta suspected was actually . . .</p><p>Was that desire?</p><p>She grabbed the mercenary by the shoulder and gave him a shove to get him moving.</p><p>Whatever it was, she didn\u2019t want to have to hit Etienne again. Her hand was throbbing and she didn\u2019t like hurting him. \u201cGo, damn it!\u201d she cried. \u201cRun!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d he said, shocking the hell out of her.</p><p>Either she was a better actress than she had thought or he wanted to score points with his superiors by capturing an immortal.</p><p>Shaking her head, she looked at Etienne. \u201cHe\u2019ll catch me. He always catches me. And he\u2019ll torture you for helping me.\u201d She added a hitch to her breath and was pleased at how close to a sob it sounded. \u201cJust go.\u201d</p><p>He did.</p><p>As the mercenary\u2019s feet pounded the pavement, Etienne stalked toward her. Hold your breath and tense your neck muscles.</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask why, just did it.</p><p>Etienne wrapped the fingers of one hand around her throat and lifted her off her feet just as the mercenary\u2019s footsteps slowed and he turned to look back.</p><p>Krysta wrapped her hands around Etienne\u2019s wrist and kicked her feet, pretending to fight even as she used her new strength to push herself up and ease the pressure on her neck.</p><p>Etienne wrapped an arm around her and shot off into the night. The hold on her neck became a caress. Krysta took several deep breaths as the campus swept past. Etienne jumped. The ground fell away and she found herself on the roof of . . .</p><p>Actually Krysta didn\u2019t know the name of this building. But they were still on campus and could see the mercenary in the distance.</p><p>Etienne set her down, drew out his phone, and dialed.</p><p>\u201cReordon,\u201d Chris answered.</p><p>It was so odd to be able to hear both sides of the conversation without the phone being on speaker.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Etienne. We tagged a mercenary at UNC Chapel Hill. He\u2019s fleeing the campus, heading south on foot. I need a cleanup crew to come collect the eleven dead or unconscious mercenaries he left behind.\u201d</p><p>He hung up before Chris could say anything, pocketed the phone, and yanked Krysta into his arms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I had to make it look real. I didn\u2019t hurt you, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It was just uncomfortable for a second.\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened as he swore in French. (She was beginning to recognize some words now.)</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asked to distract him. \u201cAm I wrong, or did my knocking the crap out of you turn you on?\u201d</p><p>Leaning back, he summoned a sheepish smile and pressed his hips against hers to let her feel his arousal. \u201cYou weren\u2019t wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Are you into the rough stuff?\u201d She had never thought of trying that kind of thing herself.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so,\u201d he said with a baffled shake of his head, \u201cBut you were\u201d\u2014his glowing eyes grew brighter\u2014\u201cmagnificent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Is this . . . something you want to explore? Sexually?\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure how that would work. She knew without trying it that hurting Etienne wouldn\u2019t turn her on. And she sure as hell didn\u2019t want him to hurt her. Pain tended to piss her off.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he said. \u201cI just adore your strength and seeing you in action aroused me.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI\u2019d try anything you asked me to, though. In bed or out of it. I want you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and shook her head. \u201cLet\u2019s leave the pain on the battlefield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d He dipped his head and kissed her.</p><p>Her pulse leapt.</p><p>As he teased her lips with his tongue, she palmed his erection. \u201cWant to do something about this while we wait for the cleanup crew to arrive?\u201d She sure as hell did. She didn\u2019t know if it was the adrenaline still coursing through her veins or just knowing that he wanted her, but she was already wet for him, her body tingling and desperate for his touch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat depends,\u201d he whispered against her lips, leaning into her. \u201cHow do you feel about making love in front of an audience?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my thing either,\u201d she admitted. She had never been an exhibitionist.</p><p>A throat cleared. \u201cThen you might want to step away from my brother,\u201d Richart drawled behind them, \u201cso I won\u2019t get an eyeful.\u201d</p> <p>Krysta yanked her hand away so fast you\u2019d think Etienne\u2019s crotch had caught fire.</p><p>Spinning around, she found Richart standing there with one eyebrow raised.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked, face heating.</p><p>\u201cEtienne summoned me while he was dealing with the mercenaries.\u201d</p><p>Krysta glanced back at Etienne. \u201cMy, aren\u2019t you the multitasker.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cForgive me. I forgot I called him as soon as you hit me.\u201d And turned me on. You managed to scatter my thoughts quite efficiently.</p><p>She could understand that. The desire he had sparked in her had made her forget about the mercenaries he had left strewn who-knew-where. She smiled. \u201cOkay. You\u2019re forgiven.\u201d Particularly since Richart\u2019s sudden presence had doused her lust as efficiently as a fire hose.</p><p>Etienne raised the scope and looked around. \u201cKrysta, would you keep an eye out for more mercenaries while Richart and I gather together the dead and unconscious soldiers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She took the scope.</p><p>He brushed a kiss across her lips, then motioned for his brother to follow him over the edge of the building.</p><p>Krysta raised the scope to her right eye and turned in a slow circle, searching the campus in all directions.</p> <p>If you get bored, Etienne suddenly spoke in her head, feel free to talk dirty to me. Richart can\u2019t hear you.</p><p>She smiled and did just that.</p><p>Sitting on his haunches, Zach took in the melee below. UNC Greensboro\u2019s campus was quiet and deserted save the immortal warrior who battled five vampires down on the ground.</p><p>A rare smile lifted his lips.</p><p>She was magnificent, remaining in constant motion, swinging her blades with merciless intent.</p><p>The vampires Lisette fought had long since lost their grasp on sanity. Zach searched their thoughts easily, and the things they wanted to do to her sickened him.</p><p>A vamp got in a lucky strike.</p><p>Blood formed a glistening streak across the back of her long coat.</p> <p>Zach rose and curled his hands into fists, an unfamiliar feeling sweeping over him.</p><p>The lucky striker went down and began to shrivel up. His friends trod upon him in slavering urgency.</p><p>Again she struck a killing blow. Another vampire fell.</p><p>A noise distracted Zach. Then a scent.</p><p>He searched the darkened campus with eyes that needed no infrared scope to pierce the deepest shadows.</p><p>Human males with automatic weapons closed in on Lisette\u2019s location.</p><p>Mercenaries.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t expected this. He had merely wanted, for reasons he couldn\u2019t discern, to see her in action. He hadn\u2019t wanted to see her captured.</p><p>The hours he had spent watching Seth and his little superheroes, coupled with the hours he had spent eavesdropping at David\u2019s house, had revealed what these men would likely do to her if they caught her.</p><p>The last vampire fell. Breathing hard, she cleaned her blade on the shirt of one of the fallen vamps and sheathed her weapons.</p><p>The humans took their positions.</p><p>A dart struck her in her pale, vulnerable neck.</p><p>Wincing, she reached up to identify the source of the sharp pain. Alarm crossed her pretty face as she staggered. She pulled something that looked like a fat, white pen from her pocket and stabbed herself in the thigh with it.</p><p>The mercenaries closed in, forming a circle around her.</p><p>Lisette dropped the pen and straightened.</p><p>A tense moment passed. Then another.</p><p>Zach took a step forward.</p><p>Moving so fast she blurred, Lisette drew her Glock 18s and raced toward the building on her left.</p><p>Muffled gunfire erupted as she leapt up a couple of stories, pushed off the side of the building and landed on the roof of the building across from it.</p><p>The soldiers scattered as she sprayed them with bullets from above. Four went down as holes opened on their torsos.</p><p>She jerked, bullets tearing through her slender body as the mercenaries scored hits of their own, but didn\u2019t cease firing or run away.</p><p>Zach clenched his teeth.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t win. She wouldn\u2019t win.</p><p>And she lacked the time to call her brothers for aid.</p><p>She backed up and crouched down. Ejecting the long clips from her weapons, she drew two more from a pocket of her coat and shoved them into place.</p><p>Zach had never handled a gun before and admired her smooth, sure movements.</p><p>Staying out of sight of the men below, she headed for the opposite side of the building and leapt to the ground.</p><p>The mercenary group divided into thirds. One third remained in place. The rest divided in half and began to circle the building on both sides.</p><p>Shit!</p><p>Lisette sped into the open, crossing to the next building, and sprayed the soldiers with bullets.</p><p>They jerked and fell to the ground, only getting off a few shots of their own.</p><p>Maybe he had been too hasty. Maybe she would actually come out the victor.</p><p>No sooner had the thought struck than a dozen more mercenaries entered the fray.</p><p>Lisette raced directly into their midst, wreaking havoc, breaking necks, cutting throats, and taking more bullets and tranquilizer darts.</p><p>The darts didn\u2019t worry him. He had heard the immortals say the antidote prevented further exposure to the sedative from affecting them. But the bullet wounds . . .</p><p>Instead of healing, they continued to bleed, a symptom of the weakness infiltrating her and spreading within as she continued to lose blood.</p><p>His heart pounded. His breath shortened.</p><p>She was slowing down. Still fighting. Still slaying. But slowing down. Suffering more wounds.</p><p>The soldiers tightened ranks, again boldly encircling her.</p><p>He sensed no fear in her, only a determination to take out as many as she could before she breathed her last breath.</p><p>Well, fuck that.</p><p>Knowing the step he was about to take would forever alter his future, Zach released his wings and took to the air.</p><p>Panting, gritting her teeth against the pain, Lisette swung her shoto sword at the soldier in front of her and sliced open his chest.</p><p>How many were there? It seemed as though every time she slew one, two more took his place.</p><p>And she was weakening, moving almost as slowly as a human, losing the edge immortal speed and strength had given her.</p><p>A breeze coaxed some of her hair from its braid.</p><p>She felt a presence behind her.</p><p>The mercenaries all gasped and stumbled backward, looking over her shoulder.</p><p>Lisette spun around . . . and gaped.</p><p>It was him. The elder immortal she, Roland, and Sarah had interrogated.</p><p>Zach.</p><p>Facing away from her, he wore only low-riding dark leather pants similar to the ones he had sported when she had abducted him. His wings were stretched wide, their tips brushing the walls of nearby buildings.</p><p>More than one of the mercenaries crossed themselves.</p><p>Zach waved a hand.</p><p>The mercenaries dropped their weapons to the ground with a clatter.</p><p>Lisette glanced behind her.</p><p>Yes. Those had dropped their weapons, too.</p><p>Dizziness assailed her.</p><p>She staggered, barely managing to remain on her feet. She had lost count of the number of times she had been shot.</p><p>Darkness threatened.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think, didn\u2019t know what was happening.</p><p>Was Zach working with the mercenaries?</p><p>She stared at the back of his head, at his windblown, longish, raven hair.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said, pointing at a soldier.</p><p>The mercenary stepped forward.</p><p>The elder immortal made a motion with his hand and closed it into a fist. The other mercenaries all collapsed to the ground, sightless eyes wide as they drew their last breaths.</p><p>Those beautiful wings folded in against Zach\u2019s back.</p><p>He turned to face her.</p><p>Lisette tilted her head way back to look up at him. He was well over a foot taller than she was and she stood at five foot six.</p><p>\u201cThe tracking device,\u201d he said, his glowing golden eyes locking on hers.</p><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d she rasped.</p><p>He held out a large hand, palm up. \u201cThe tracking device you\u2019re supposed to plant on him. Give it to me.\u201d</p><p>She dropped one of her beloved shoto swords and fumbled with the outer pocket that contained the tiny tracking device Chris had given her. Her fingers wouldn\u2019t cooperate. She couldn\u2019t even get the pocket open and it wasn\u2019t buttoned.</p><p>Zach gently brushed her hand aside and tucked his own hand in the pocket. When he withdrew it, the tracking device was carefully pinched between his thumb and forefinger.</p><p>He waved the mercenary over.</p><p>The soldier approached robotically and waited patiently while the immortal picked up one of the discarded M16s, then attached the device to it.</p><p>Lisette wanted to protest when he handed the man the weapon, but couldn\u2019t find enough breath for it.</p><p>\u201cYou saw neither of us tonight. Vampires attacked your squad and only you survived,\u201d Zach said.</p><p>The mercenary nodded, then turned and jogged away.</p><p>Zach swiveled to face her.</p><p>\u201cM-mind control?\u201d she managed to ask.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She tried to ask about the others, but could only motion to them.</p><p>\u201cRuptured aneurysms. I\u2019ve never altered the health of a human before and am actually surprised it worked.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Her knees buckled.</p><p>Zach caught her before she could hit the ground. \u201cEasy,\u201d he said, his voice soft and deep. Kneeling, he laid her on the ground with her upper body cradled in his lap.</p><p>Moonlight formed a halo around his head as she stared up at him, struggling for breath.</p><p>The bullets had done a lot of damage. She knew that, rather than kill her, excessive damage would send her into a sort of stasis not unlike the hibernation of a water bear. But she had never done that before and couldn\u2019t help but fear the prospect as she felt her heart rate slow. And slow some more.</p><p>He rested a hand on her chest.</p><p>At first she thought he was feeling her up and forgot everything else in a few seconds\u2019 shock. Then she realized his thumb rested upon her collarbone and his fingers weren\u2019t splayed enough to reach her breasts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His hand heated, warm and comforting. A tingling feeling engulfed her, part pleasure and part pain, beginning in her chest and sweeping down her arms to her fingers, down her torso to her thighs, calves, and toes. Misshapen bullets emerged from her flesh. Bleeding ceased. Wounds closed. Bones shattered by bullets fused themselves back together. Her collapsed lung reinflated. Her breathing grew easier. The pain receded, then vanished entirely.</p><p>He removed his hand from her chest, curling it into a loose fist, then rubbing his thumb against his fingers as though touching her had made him tingle.</p><p>She sat up, but didn\u2019t move away. Just to double check, she pulled the neckline of her sticky shirt away from her body and peered down through it at her bare chest and bra-encased breasts. No wounds. Only dried blood.</p> <p>She let the material fall back against her and stared up at him, too tired to attempt to stand yet. He had healed her wounds, but severe blood loss still rendered her weak.</p><p>A shiver shook her.</p><p>He unfurled his beautiful wings and cupped them around her like a tent, keeping the breeze at bay.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she asked when she could find her voice. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZach,\u201d he said simply.</p> <p>\u201cThat only tells me your name, not who you are.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cSeth calls me Cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Seth\u2019s cousin?\u201d Merde. He really was an elder. She had never heard of any immortal other than David being so close to their leader in age. Or who may actually be able to match his power.</p><p>And that had been quite a power display, killing the mercenaries without even touching them.</p><p>\u201cWhy have I never heard of you?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever come inside when you visit David\u2019s? Why do you keep your presence a secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither Seth nor David would want me there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? Did you have a falling-out?\u201d</p><p>He seemed to weigh his words. \u201cSeth and I chose different paths when we were still young men and disagreed with each other\u2019s choices.\u201d</p><p>David would have, of course, taken Seth\u2019s side. He and Seth were like brothers.</p><p>\u201cAre you enemies?\u201d She was pretty sure she would have heard about it if this man had been actively trying to kill Seth or wage war with him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Just no. Nothing more.</p><p>She had a feeling she wasn\u2019t going to get anything more specific than that, but tried anyway. \u201cSo, you\u2019re immortal, but don\u2019t lead the life of an Immortal Guardian? You don\u2019t hunt vampires or have a Second?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUntil tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, I let you slay the vampires, then took care of the mercenaries when you faltered.\u201d</p><p>And saved her life. Had he not stepped in when he did, the mercenaries would have captured her. \u201cSo you intervened where, in the past, you would not have.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He clenched and unclenched his jaw. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let them take you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>If she didn\u2019t need blood so badly just then, she was sure her heart would have begun to beat faster.</p><p>Had he veered from his chosen path for her?</p><p>\u201cYou need blood,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>She nodded, a shock of excitement darting through her at the idea of leaning into him, pressing against that wide, muscled, bare chest, and touching her lips to his neck.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t give you mine,\u201d he said, his deep voice full of . . . regret?</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d What the hell was she doing? Was she attracted to him? A man who had freely admitted he was at odds with Seth, the wisest man she knew and to whom she owed her life and allegiance?</p><p>Snapping out of it, she fumbled with her coat, seeking the right pocket and\u2014fingers tangling in a couple of holes\u2014managed to draw out her cell phone.</p><p>Or what was left of it. A bullet had forged a hole through it on its way to her liver.</p><p>Wonderful.</p><p>\u201cMay I borrow your phone?\u201d she asked. \u201cI need to call my Second.\u201d Tracy could take care of notifying Chris that a cleanup crew was needed and have Richart bring Lisette some much-needed blood.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t carry a phone.\u201d</p><p>Okay. Plan B.</p><p>She looked at the lifeless mercenary bodies around them. Tucking them away, out of sight, seemed a monumental task as low on energy and strength as she was right now. And when her energy was low, her telepathic range diminished greatly.</p><p>Etienne? she called. Perhaps he and Krysta were hunting nearby.</p><p>Nothing. Etienne! I need you.</p><p>Still nothing.</p><p>Richart? She had an even smaller chance of contacting Richart because he couldn\u2019t send his reply telepathically. He could only think it and hope she would pick up on it.</p><p>\u201cI can take you where you need to go,\u201d Zach said, his eyes never leaving her.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t leave these bodies here. I need to contact the network and have them come clean things up, hide what happened from the humans.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cIf I were a different man, I\u2019d say you owe me one.\u201d</p><p>One what? And shouldn\u2019t being in this powerful immortal\u2019s debt alarm her? \u201cFor killing the mercenaries and saving me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, for this.\u201d He closed his eyes.</p><p>He was so handsome. Straight nose. Strong, shadowed jaw. Ebony brows over eyes so dark a brown they were almost black . . . when they weren\u2019t glowing golden. Just like Seth\u2019s.</p><p>He opened those eyes and met hers. \u201cHelp is on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you sit by yourself?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t even realized he had been supporting her with an arm behind her back.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She sat up straighter.</p><p>Withdrawing his arm, he rose and backed away.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, sensing he wouldn\u2019t stay until help arrived.</p><p>He nodded. Bending his knees, he leapt up into the air and brought those powerful wings down, shooting into the sky like a missile and disappearing from sight.</p><p>Lisette didn\u2019t know what to think. Of him. Of what he had done.</p><p>Seth appeared several yards away, his back to her. \u201cWhat?\u201d he growled. \u201cI don\u2019t appreciate being summoned so . . .\u201d He trailed off.</p><p>Lisette felt as anxious facing Seth now as she had the first time she had realized just how much power he wielded.</p><p>Would he view her interaction with Zach as a betrayal?</p><p>He took in the dead mercenaries and turned around. \u201cLisette!\u201d In a heartbeat, he knelt beside her and touched her shoulder. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cJust weak. I\u2019ve lost a lot of blood.\u201d</p><p>A couple of humans strolled in their direction, not yet in sight of the carnage.</p><p>Seth waved a hand in their direction, mentally guiding them away. \u201cI was summoned here by another,\u201d he said, studying her closely.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cZach was here.\u201d</p><p>No visible reaction. \u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He saved me.\u201d</p><p>A long pause followed, during which she fought the urge to squirm.</p><p>Was he reading her thoughts, surfing through them and replaying what had happened?</p><p>He drew out his phone and dialed. \u201cChris? Seth. Send a cleanup crew to UNCG. A couple of dozen mercenaries attacked Lisette and are dead. One fled bearing a tracking device.\u201d</p><p>He had definitely read her thoughts. Lisette just hoped he hadn\u2019t noticed the fascination and, yes, attraction she felt for the other elder.</p><p>\u201cThey did? Excellent. Keep me posted.\u201d He pocketed his phone. \u201cEtienne and Krysta also engaged mercenaries tonight, over at UNC Chapel Hill, and succeeded in planting a tracking device on one. Chris is already tracking him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you hold out until the cleanup crew arrives, or shall I take you home or to David\u2019s for blood now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can wait.\u201d For blood. She couldn\u2019t wait for a verdict on her encounter with Zach. \u201cAre you angry?\u201d she asked tentatively.</p><p>\u201cWith you? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Zach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is he, Seth?\u201d</p><p>He looked at the bodies around them again. \u201cI\u2019m not sure anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he\u2019s your cousin,\u201d she pressed.</p><p>\u201cDid he?\u201d</p><p>A human approached, accompanied by staticky walkie-talkie speech.</p><p>Lisette\u2019s heart skipped. More mercenaries?</p><p>Seth covered her hand with his. \u201cCampus security.\u201d He looked in the direction from which the sounds came.</p><p>The human\u2019s footsteps stopped, then carried him away.</p><p>Disturbed\u2019s \u201cDown With the Sickness\u201d swelled from Seth\u2019s pocket. Retrieving his phone, he answered, \u201cYes?\u201d He met Lisette\u2019s gaze and smiled. \u201cWord travels fast. Yes, she\u2019s here. She\u2019s fine. Her phone was just destroyed.\u201d He held out the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s Tracy.\u201d Don\u2019t mention Zach.</p><p>Lisette took the phone, aware that Seth had neither confirmed nor denied that Zach was his cousin.</p><p>\u201cTwo mercenaries tagged,\u201d he murmured as she assured Tracy she was fine and glossed over what had happened, leaving out Zach. \u201cIt\u2019s been an interesting night.\u201d</p><p>Once the immortals and Seconds staying at David\u2019s had bedded down for the day, Seth and David retreated to David\u2019s study.</p><p>Seth told him what had happened with Zach and Lisette.</p><p>David\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cHe helped her?\u201d</p><p>Seth nodded, still unsure what to make of it.</p><p>\u201cHow did he kill the mercenaries? I didn\u2019t think he carried a weapon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told Lisette he gave them all ruptured aneurysms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat takes both power and precision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must be practicing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn whom? And why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps when Seth had warned Zach months ago that the Others couldn\u2019t best him because Seth had been exercising and growing his powers, it had struck a nerve. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow did he even know Lisette was in trouble?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cI suspect he was following her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he do that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe, Roland, and Sarah captured him a couple of weeks ago and interrogated him.\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s eyebrows nearly met his hairline. \u201cI assume he let them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Not yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did they ask him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been seeing Ami. They wanted to know why.\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s face filled with pure menace. \u201cBy seeing her . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been meeting with her on your roof.\u201d</p><p>Utter disbelief mingled with the menace. \u201cHow did I not sense his presence?\u201d</p><p>Seth shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s learned to mask it in some way. I didn\u2019t even sense it myself. Had I not read Lisette\u2019s thoughts, I would not have known anything about it.\u201d</p> <p>Judging by his expression, the idea that Zach could come and go without their knowledge unsettled David as much as it did Seth.</p><p>\u201cApparently,\u201d Seth went on, \u201cAmi can detect his presence and joins him up on the roof whenever he pulls gargoyle duty up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn her condition?\u201d David said with disapproval.</p><p>Seth snorted. \u201cShe\u2019s as sure-footed as a cat and has exhibited no dizziness thus far. I don\u2019t think we have any worries there.\u201d</p><p>David grunted. \u201cSo he can mask his presence, but not his energy signature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is Ami\u2019s interest in him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Seth admitted. He seemed to be saying that a lot lately. \u201cI think that\u2019s the biggest puzzle of all.\u201d</p> <p>David frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s romantic, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Ami sees no one but Marcus in that light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d David pondered the mystery for some time. \u201cPerhaps he reminds her of you.\u201d</p><p>Seth grimaced. \u201cI hope not.\u201d</p><p>The sound of a car turning onto the long drive caught his ear. He looked toward the front of the house the same time David did.</p><p>A window rolled down so the driver could lean out and punch in the security code.</p><p>The music of Miles Davis floated to their ears.</p><p>\u201cChris,\u201d they said in unison.</p><p>Reordon always played Miles when he was stressed.</p><p>The car seemed to crawl up the lane so slowly Seth thought Chris could have walked and reached the house faster. The engine stopped. His car door opened and closed.</p><p>\u201cDoes Chris ever sleep?\u201d David asked as they followed his progress up the walk and through the front door.</p><p>\u201cNot much. Not enough. But he refuses to delegate.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps approached from the hallway.</p><p>\u201cYou ever been to his place?\u201d Seth asked.</p><p>David nodded. \u201cLooked like a typhoon hit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, guys,\u201d Chris complained, entering. \u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know,\u201d they said.</p><p>He dropped a briefcase on the floor and flopped down in the chair next to Seth, across the desk from David.</p><p>\u201cHow did the tracking go?\u201d Seth asked.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d He opened the briefcase, drew out a folded piece of paper, then leaned forward and spread a map out on the desk. \u201cBoth mercenaries headed for the same rendezvous point here.\u201d He pointed to an area on the outskirts of Chapel Hill. \u201cThey remained there until daybreak, presumably to ensure they weren\u2019t followed by immortals or vampires, then headed here on wheels they must have stashed somewhere because they moved much more quickly.\u201d He pointed to an isolated area between Mebane and Saxapahaw. \u201cAgain, they waited, then were probably taken blindfolded by someone they met there\u2014if the mercenaries stayed true to what they did before\u2014to what I believe is the PMC\u2019s base here near Burlington.\u201d</p><p>He reached into his bag again and drew out an iPad. \u201cHere\u2019s a satellite image of the area,\u201d he said, bringing it up for them.</p><p>Seth set the tablet on the desk so David could examine it, too, and leaned forward. \u201cDid one of your new contacts send you this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m leery of risking their involvement.\u201d</p><p>Seth hesitated to say anything. Chris still labored under the ass-load of guilt piled on his shoulders after discovering that his former contacts and their spouses and children, had all been either tortured to death or shot execution style by the last mercenary group they had fought in an attempt to extract information and send a message. But one of the things that made Chris indispensable to the Immortal Guardians was his ability to recruit contacts in very high places. Contacts who had been invaluable in the past. \u201cChris\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ll get there. I will. If I thought lives depended on it now, I would risk it in a heartbeat,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThen where did you get this?\u201d Seth tapped the satellite image of a building surrounded by forest.</p><p>\u201cThis is a map I got off the Internet. You can get satellite images of just about any place on the net by typing in the address or GPS coordinates, but the images are often out of date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about that,\u201d Seth murmured. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to explore crap on the Internet.\u201d</p><p>David nodded. \u201cAnd I\u2019d rather read a good book when I find a few free minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmit it,\u201d Chris said. \u201cYou\u2019re both just a couple of old farts who are technologically challenged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmitted without shame.\u201d</p><p>Chris smiled and shook his head. \u201cYou can zoom out or in by pressing these buttons.\u201d</p><p>David pressed the zoom out minus sign a couple of times and studied the area. \u201cSo this is probably out of date? The mercenaries could have expanded the structure or added security features?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. This looks pretty generic, so I think you can pretty much bet on it. If they transport the mercenaries blindfolded and in windowless vehicles, I\u2019m pretty damned sure they\u2019re going to have every kind of security and surveillance feature they can afford.\u201d</p><p>Seth caught David\u2019s gaze. \u201cShall we go have a look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m game.\u201d</p><p>Chris slumped farther down in his chair. \u201cI\u2019ll wait here until you get back. Give me a call if you get into trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo lie down,\u201d David urged him, rising.</p><p>Chris shook his head, eyelids heavy. \u201cI\u2019m good here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it yourself,\u201d Seth pressed. \u201cWe\u2019re a couple of old farts, not youngsters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral thousand years your senior,\u201d David added.</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t have to baby us,\u201d Seth finished.</p><p>\u201cTo quote Sheldon and Melanie: Says you.\u201d</p><p>The elders laughed and shook their heads. Striding from the room, they headed down the hallway, out the front door, and into bright afternoon sunlight.</p><p>\u201cTeleport or fly?\u201d Seth offered.</p><p>David closed his eyes and turned his face up to the sun. \u201cFly.\u201d</p><p>That had been his choice as well. Flying was a real stress reliever.</p><p>The shadows they cast on the brick path morphed into that of large vultures as he and David shifted form and took to the sky.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>North Carolina was a beautiful state. The area above which Seth and David soared boasted rolling hills and meadows, corn fields, hay fields, and forest. Rivers and streams wended through the countryside like arteries, feeding numerous lakes and ponds. Wildlife abounded. And the two eldest immortals were not the only \u201ccarrion birds\u201d surfing the breeze.</p><p>A vulture that shared their glossy black wings joined them, searching the ground below to see what had caught their attention and regarding them curiously.</p><p>Inwardly, Seth smiled.</p><p>I needed this, David said.</p><p>I did, too.</p><p>The trip did not take long by air. Soon the land beneath them began to mimic the satellite image Chris had shown them. There were differences, as he had warned. Fewer trees, thanks to logging and a new housing development under construction that was still in the skeletal stage. The mercenaries probably wouldn\u2019t like that. They wouldn\u2019t want neighbors so close to their home base.</p><p>That must be it, he said as the thick trees beyond parted, revealing a building that looked quite different from the one in the dated satellite image.</p><p>The mercenaries had doubled its width, but the different-colored roofs\u2014old and new\u2014allowed Seth to discern the original structure. The flowering trees in front of it had been removed, leaving a large open area and a small parking lot. Two large hangars rested like small football stadiums nearby. Barracks that reminded him of those their previous mercenary enemy had employed formed rows between the main building and the hangars. A nice collection of Black Hawk helicopters rested on helipads beside the hangars, in which Seth glimpsed armored personnel carriers and Humvees.</p><p>All was surrounded by a twenty-foot fence woven throughout and topped with razor wire.</p><p>As with the other PMC encampment, one road led in and out and required inspection by guards armed with automatic weapons.</p><p>DEj\u00e0 vu, David uttered.</p><p>Seth agreed. It was all very similar to Emrys\u2019s base, to which Donald and Nelson had been frequent visitors.</p><p>Do you think all mercenary bases look like this? David asked.</p><p>I know little about them, Seth confessed.</p><p>Each building bore surveillance cameras. The main building bore two different-colored bricks where Seth guessed they had replaced windows with walls. The front door was steel.</p><p>More soldiers, bearing automatic weapons, walked the grounds and the perimeter.</p><p>I\u2019m getting a bad feeling, David said.</p><p>So was Seth. The feeling that they had indeed screwed up and missed something. The similarities were too numerous. This base was too reminiscent of the other. Coupled with the knowledge that these men had acquired the tranquilizer, Seth could only conclude that\u2014</p><p>We must have missed something, David announced grimly.</p><p>Yes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Do you think it\u2019s Donald and Nelson?</p><p>Their memories were wiped, so if it is them, they\u2019re operating on whatever information the hard drive or whatever gadget we missed contained.</p><p>Which could be a little or a lot.</p><p>Their feathered companion swung away just as a scent reached Seth.</p> <p>You smell that? he asked.</p><p>Death.</p><p>They banked, circling around to follow the vulture to its feast.</p><p>\u201cAre those vultures?\u201d he heard a guard down below ask.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I told you the body was too close. If the wind changes it\u2019s gonna smell like shit.\u201d</p> <p>The vulture led them to the body of a mercenary who had been shot in the head.</p><p>Seth and David joined the bird in circling above it.</p><p>Do you think it\u2019s one of the men Lisette, Etienne, and Krysta tagged? David asked.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure. Why kill only one of them?</p><p>And, if they killed him because they found the tracking device, why are they still here? Why aren\u2019t they all bugging out?</p><p>Let\u2019s widen our circles so we can fly over without raising suspicion and pick their brains. Perhaps they\u2019re busy designing a trap if they think we know where they are.</p> <p>Reading the minds of the guards from this distance was a challenge, simply because maintaining this form already took a lot of concentration, but both elders could do it.</p><p>You weren\u2019t exaggerating, David said. Had they been in their usual forms, Seth knew David would be shaking his head. They know almost nothing about the outfit that employs them.</p><p>Most don\u2019t care because it pays so well.</p><p>I\u2019m not hearing anything about traps. No anticipation of our arrival.</p><p>Nor any mention of the tracking devices.</p><p>They seem to regard the slain one as a betrayer, yet can\u2019t say why.</p><p>They were told he had betrayed them, but not how.</p><p>A couple more vultures joined them, circling the carcass below.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to read the minds of the men in the hangars and the barracks, Seth said. You take the men in the main building.</p><p>It was a time-consuming task. Holding these forms for extended lengths sapped their energy, but neither complained. What they learned here could save lives.</p><p>By the time they finished, half a dozen vultures were picking the dead soldier\u2019s bones clean.</p><p>I got nothing, David said at length. None are aware of any plans to capture us. No one has been warned about or knows anything about the tracking devices. And, while they\u2019re all speculating and coming up with their own ideas, none know why the dead soldier was deemed a traitor.</p><p>Apparently only the commander of the army knows why and he isn\u2019t here.</p><p>And, of course, they don\u2019t know where he is. This is ridiculous , David said with irritation he rarely exhibited. There is a point at which gullibility ceases and stupidity begins.</p><p>I know. They passed that point as soon as they saw their first paycheck and, because they assume that everything they are doing is legal and at the behest of some government contract, they have no problem with the killing.</p><p>Money has made them imbeciles!</p><p>They were imbeciles before that. The money just gave them a chance to confirm it. How are you holding up? Generally the only time David\u2019s mellow temperament succumbed to irritation or anger was when he was in pain. They had been out in the strong midday sun for a few hours now while expending large amounts of energy to retain the forms of vultures. While Seth was weary, David was probably really feeling it by now.</p><p>I could use some blood, he admitted reluctantly.</p><p>We aren\u2019t going to learn any more here today. Let\u2019s head home.</p><p>The fact that David didn\u2019t protest told Seth the pain was substantial. He should have asked David to shift forms and wait on the ground in the shade at least an hour ago.</p><p>Five miles beyond the fence, Seth banked toward the ground.</p><p>David followed without question.</p><p>Seth shifted just above the grass and landed on his feet.</p><p>David did the same, but stumbled.</p><p>Seth braced him until he could get his balance, then drew him into the shade of a nearby tree and placed his hand on David\u2019s chest, absorbing his pain. \u201cForgive me. I lost track of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. We needed the information.\u201d</p><p>When David sighed with relief and nodded, Seth removed his hand and clapped him on the shoulder, teleporting them home.</p><p>\u201cYou seem nervous,\u201d Krysta said, eyeing Etienne with some concern. The only other time she had seen him this nervous was when he had been about to ask Seth if she could be transformed.</p><p>Even facing multiple vampires and mercenaries didn\u2019t make him nervous. So what was up?</p><p>The two continued to arm themselves for the night\u2019s hunt while she awaited his response. Cam was training with Sean in the home gym down in the basement.</p><p>Sean hadn\u2019t been as pissed as she had thought he would be when she had transformed. He actually had seemed relieved that she would now be much safer when hunting.</p><p>Etienne cleared his throat and opened his mouth. Let it hang open. Closed it and turned back to the cabinet in which he kept his many daggers.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on. It can\u2019t be that bad,\u201d she coaxed. \u201cCan it?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a quick glance from the corner of his eye. \u201cDo you have enough daggers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell me what it is!\u201d she blurted, then clamped her lips shut. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just that imagining whatever catastrophe might make you nervous is beginning to make me nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a catastrophe,\u201d he muttered. \u201cOr wasn\u2019t. I seem to be making it one. Cam warned me I would, damn him for being right.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips.</p><p>Crossing to him, she took the dagger from his hand, slipped it into its sheath and turned him to face her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, sweetie?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cHave I mentioned how much I like it when you call me that?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYes. So, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>He leaned back against the cabinet and crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cI talked to Chris earlier. He mentioned assigning you your own Second now that you\u2019re immortal and said he has a couple of houses in mind for you and Sean to choose from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her stomach sank. She had thought . . .</p><p>Well, she hadn\u2019t thought. Not about this.</p><p>When she and Sean had first moved in, living with Etienne and Cam had been a temporary arrangement. She had even mentioned staying in a hotel. But then she had gotten to know Etienne and fallen hard for him. They had made love and admitted their feelings for each other. He had transformed her and helped her adjust to her new condition. They had spent nights hunting together and days . . .</p><p>She hadn\u2019t slept in \u201cher\u201d bedroom in weeks. She spent the days with him in his. The subject of moving out had just never come up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go,\u201d he said.</p><p>Relief left her buoyant. \u201cI don\u2019t either. I mean, we never talked about it and I don\u2019t want to push you into anything you aren\u2019t ready for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Krysta.\u201d He straightened and took her hands. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could sleep without you beside me. I don\u2019t want to sleep without you beside me. And I want you to be right there with me every evening when I wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into his arms and claimed her lips in a kiss that seemed to carry with it everything she felt herself: relief, excitement, lust, love . . .</p><p>\u201cToo bad we have that meeting tonight,\u201d he said, trailing heated kisses down her neck.</p><p>Her pulse leapt. \u201cWe\u2019re both immortal now. Can\u2019t immortals have quickies?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cImmortals give quickies a whole new meaning. But . . .\u201d He drew his hands up her sides and brushed her breasts with his thumbs. \u201cI like to savor you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat disappoints me and excites me all at the same time.\u201d</p><p>He brushed her lips with his once more. \u201cSo you\u2019ll stay with me? You\u2019ll live here with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Happily.</p><p>\u201cHow would you feel if I told you that I\u2019m an old-fashioned guy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and wish to marry you and spend the rest of eternity as your husband?\u201d</p><p>She stopped breathing. \u201cYou want to marry me?\u201d Marriage was big for immortals. For them, \u2019til death do us part could mean hundreds, even thousands, of years.</p><p>\u201cMore than anything,\u201d he vowed, the sincerity in his voice unmistakeable.</p><p>Krysta threw her arms around his neck and squeezed him tight.</p><p>\u201cIs that a yes?\u201d he asked, sliding his arms around her and burying his face in her hair.</p><p>\u201cYes. A very enthusiastic yes!\u201d</p><p>He hugged her close and said with some regret, \u201cI wanted more time to woo you.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cTo what me?\u201d</p><p>He popped her lightly on the butt. \u201cStop mocking me.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s fun.\u201d</p><p>Straightening, he brushed her hair back from her forehead and cupped her face in his large hands. \u201cI wanted to spend months courting you properly. I planned to spend months courting you properly once we\u2019d quashed this latest threat. But Chris kept mentioning the damned house . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cEtienne, you have been courting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t. All we\u2019ve done since we met is train and fight vampires and mercenaries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetie, I\u2019m not a flowers and chocolates kind of gal,\u201d she said, leaning into him. \u201cWell, maybe the chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to say.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. He had seen her put away a lot of chocolate. \u201cI don\u2019t need flowers. I don\u2019t need jewelry. I don\u2019t need . . . whatever other frilly things men give the women they\u2019re dating.\u201d She hadn\u2019t dated anyone long-term since Michael and couldn\u2019t remember what men usually brought their girlfriends. \u201cI need weapons. And you have given me some beautiful weapons.\u201d</p><p>She no longer carried Lisette\u2019s weapons. Etienne had, over the weeks, gifted her with her own personal arsenal. Shoto swords. Katanas. Daggers. Throwing stars. Glock 18s. Sigs. Her very own uncomfortable rubbery suit to wear if she had to venture into daylight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve talked for hours,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve laughed and flirted and teased.\u201d She nipped his chin. \u201cSeduced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very good at that,\u201d he said, voice deepening.</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p> <p>He began to move from side to side, the two of them swaying to slow, nonexistent music. \u201cAll of them.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou see? We\u2019re even dancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what this is? I was just enjoying the feel of you against me.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s what we called it at my high school prom.\u201d And she was loving the feel of his hard body pressed to hers.</p><p>\u201cDancing was very different in my day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould you teach me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love to.\u201d</p><p>A throat cleared.</p><p>Cam and Sean stood in the doorway.</p><p>Cam raised his eyebrows. \u201cShould I call and tell them you\u2019ll be late for the meeting?\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Etienne shook his head. \u201cNo. And you were wrong. It wasn\u2019t a catastrophe.\u201d</p> <p>Krysta grinned. \u201cWe\u2019re engaged.\u201d</p><p>Sean\u2019s face brightened. Striding forward, he hugged her and shook Etienne\u2019s hand. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>Cam did the opposite, hugging Etienne and shaking Krysta\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Sean said, \u201cwhile we\u2019re talking about the future . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ll stay with us,\u201d Etienne said, then looked to Krysta.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Unlike many siblings she knew, they rarely fought. And, since Cam already lived with them, it wasn\u2019t as if Sean would be intruding upon their privacy or anything.</p><p>Sean tucked his hands in his pockets, a nervous gesture she hadn\u2019t seen him make in a long time. \u201cActually, I\u2019ve come to a decision.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like the sound of that, nor the somber look on his face. Had he changed his mind about working for the network? He had seemed very happy working with Dr. Lipton these last few weeks.</p> <p>\u201cEtienne,\u201d Sean said, \u201cI would like you to transform me.\u201d</p><p>Krysta\u2019s jaw hit the floor. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Sean held up his hands. \u201cNow, hear me out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be awesome!\u201d she practically shouted.</p><p>Sean blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Jumping up and down, she tugged on Etienne\u2019s arm. \u201cYou have to do it! That would be so cool! You have to do it! You have to do it!\u201d</p><p>Etienne hesitated. He didn\u2019t want to disappoint Krysta or squash her excitement, especially after she had just made his existence by agreeing to be his wife, but . . . \u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asked Sean.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. If you doubt me, read my mind.\u201d</p><p>Etienne did and found, to his relief, absolute certainty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m as proficient with weapons as Krysta is,\u201d Sean said, \u201cso I wouldn\u2019t require a lot of training.\u201d</p><p>Krysta nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s good. He really is.\u201d</p><p>Etienne smiled. She was like a child trying to convince a parent to buy her that one special toy she wanted for Christmas. \u201cWhat about medical school?\u201d</p><p>Krysta sobered. \u201cOh. Crap. I forgot about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Sean said. \u201cSince I\u2019ll be able to do everything faster, including read, I can finish my studies in record time under Dr. Lipton\u2019s instruction. She has already agreed to oversee my education and I can serve my residency at network headquarters.\u201d</p><p>Etienne was impressed. \u201cSounds like you\u2019ve considered everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have. When I\u2019m not studying, I\u2019ll be able to hunt instead of having to sit on the sidelines as I have for the last six years.\u201d His thoughts revealed just how much that had bothered him. \u201cI\u2019ll be able to heal\u2014Krysta or anyone else who needs it\u2014without risking my life. And I could potentially live forever.\u201d</p><p>With everything that had been happening in recent years, the enemies who had risen up against them, the Immortal Guardians could use another healer in the area. \u201cAs long as Seth grants his approval, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Squealing, Krysta threw her arms around Etienne and hugged him tight, then hugged her brother.</p><p>Cam clapped Sean on the back. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo . . . you\u2019re okay with what will happen when Etienne bites you?\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded. \u201cDr. Lipton told me what to expect and I saw what Krysta went through with the illness, so yeah.\u201d</p><p>Face solemn, Cam shook his head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about the illness. I was talking about the other thing.\u201d</p><p>What other thing? Etienne asked him silently. What are you doing?</p><p>Just having a little fun with him. Play along.</p><p>\u201cWhat other thing?\u201d Sean asked, smile fading.</p><p>Cam lowered his voice conspiratorially. \u201cYou know. The intense sexual bond it will forge between you two.\u201d</p><p>Etienne was looking at Krysta when Cam made the absurd claim and nearly burst into laughter. Lightning fast, her eyes widened, she flashed all of her teeth in a grin, then sobered just as Sean turned a stricken gaze upon her.</p><p>She nodded solemnly. \u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>You are so bad, he told her.</p><p>Don\u2019t make me laugh! This is hilarious! Look at his face!</p><p>\u201cDr. Lipton didn\u2019t say anything about a sexual bond,\u201d Sean said, the picture of unease.</p><p>Krysta shrugged. \u201cShe was probably too embarrassed. You\u2019re about to become her student. I doubt she wanted you to know she was overcome with lust for Roland and tore his clothes off when he bit her. Especially since she and Bastien were already a couple then,\u201d she lied with silent glee.</p><p>Cam nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen the movies. Being bitten is always . . . incredibly erotic.\u201d</p><p>Krysta nodded. \u201cOrgasmic.\u201d</p><p>Sean swallowed. \u201cUmm . . . Okay. Wait.\u201d He actually began to sweat.</p><p>Krysta burst out laughing.</p><p>Unable to keep a straight face any longer, Etienne did, too. Then Cam.</p><p>Realizing he\u2019d been punked, Sean swore and gave Cam a hard shove. \u201cYou asshole!\u201d</p><p>Cam staggered. \u201cYou should have seen your face!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncool, man.\u201d He turned to Krysta. \u201cAnd you!\u201d Locking an arm around her neck, he drew her down and ruffled the hell out of her hair.</p><p>She laughed all the while, letting him do it even though she was strong enough to toss Sean through the roof if she wanted to.</p><p>When he released her, Sean smiled wryly up at Etienne. \u201cSo you\u2019ll transform me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Seth\u2019s permission, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there won\u2019t be anything sexual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Krysta shook her head, still smiling. \u201cThe bite actually hurts like hell. You won\u2019t be having any warm and fuzzy feelings for him. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He narrowed his eyes and shook his head. \u201cYou guys are so wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanna be a cowboy,\u201d a man began to sing to an eighties beat. \u201cAnd you can be my cowgirl.\u201d</p><p>Scowling, Etienne glanced around, then realized it was his cell phone. Damn it. He really needed to figure out who kept changing his . . . ringtone. He looked at Cam, whose mirth was unmistakable. \u201cYou?\u201d he demanded incredulously. Cam was as staid and stolid as they came.</p><p>Or he had been until five minutes ago.</p><p>Laughing, Cam shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been my Second for seven years now and haven\u2019t once cracked a joke until tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you were always so somber,\u201d Cam said. \u201cI thought you were a stick in the mud like the last immortal I served. Damn, Petrus was boring. I practically begged Chris for a transfer, then you ended up being the same. But you started loosening up after you encountered Krysta.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cSo I did, too.\u201d</p><p>Etienne narrowed his eyes. \u201cRemind me to kick your ass later.\u201d He answered the call. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d Lisette said. \u201cI just talked to Chris. We\u2019re striking the mercenaries\u2019 compound tonight. Come loaded for bear.\u201d</p><p>Krysta sat at David\u2019s dining room table, Etienne on one side of her, Sean on the other, and marveled over how dramatically her life had changed. Two months ago, she and Sean had been struggling to make ends meet and risking their lives every night as they tackled the vampire threat on their own. Exhausted. Lonely. Their futures uncertain.</p><p>Tonight she was immortal, even stronger and faster than the vampires she hunted. She fought alongside a powerful immortal warrior she loved and who had asked her to marry him earlier this evening with charming uncertainty. Her brother, still studying medicine, would soon be immortal himself and free of the threat of death if he had to heal her. And the three of them sat at a table, surrounded by more than a dozen other immortals and their Seconds, all of whom would fight to the death if necessary to defend each other and her like family.</p><p>Yes, the task before them\u2014besieging the mercenary compound\u2014was daunting and made her stomach flutter with nerves. But the future was bright. And, for the first time in years, Krysta was happy.</p><p>At least, that was, until she glanced down the table and found Roland staring at her. Again. He had been watching her and studying her ever since she had arrived and it was seriously starting to aggravate her.</p><p>Seth and Chris had not yet arrived. Everyone else chatted and joked and wondered aloud if this battle would be as volatile as the last big battle with mercenaries had been.</p><p>Krysta hoped not. Etienne had told her about it and about the attack that had inspired it. And it had sounded like something out of a freaking Michael Bay movie.</p><p>Beneath the table, Etienne took her hand and rested their entwined fingers on his thigh.</p><p>They had decided not to tell anyone they were engaged tonight, since\u2014</p><p>Across the table, Lisette sucked in a breath. \u201cYou\u2019re engaged?\u201d</p><p>All conversation stopped as heads whipped around and gazes honed in on her and Etienne.</p><p>Krysta stared back, eyes wide.</p><p>Crap. She must have been reading my thoughts. \u201cI\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Etienne announced.</p><p>Lisette whooped and circled the table so fast she blurred, drawing Krysta into a hug, then squeezing the stuffing out of her brother. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for the two of you.\u201d</p><p>Richart rose and approached more slowly with a broad grin. He, too, hugged them both, as did Jenna.</p> <p>When Sheldon rose and tried to hug Krysta, Etienne shoved him aside with a roll of his eyes.</p><p>Congratulations and well wishes abounded.</p><p>Even the quiet giant, David, sitting at the head of the table on the other side of Sean, wished them happiness and expressed his pleasure over the union.</p><p>All retook their seats.</p><p>And still Roland stared.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Krysta said when she couldn\u2019t take it any longer. \u201cWhy do you keep staring at me?\u201d</p><p>Etienne glanced down at her, then followed her gaze to Roland. \u201cHe\u2019s staring at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ever since we arrived.\u201d</p><p>Etienne frowned. \u201cIf you\u2019re still pissed because I asked you to transform her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t it. I was trying to recall where we had first met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me?\u201d Krysta asked with a frown of her own. \u201cHere at David\u2019s place the night the mercenaries tore up my house.\u201d</p> <p>Roland shook his head. \u201cNo. We met before that. I just couldn\u2019t remember where until a few moments ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I would remember it if I had met you before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you had just been bitten by a vampire.\u201d</p><p>Her blood chilled. She had only been bitten by a vampire once . . . the night she and Michael had been attacked. \u201cYou were there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m the reason the vampires didn\u2019t kill you. I intervened when the scent of blood led me to you.\u201d</p><p>She gripped Etienne\u2019s hand like a lifeline. \u201cNo. I remember the attack. The chemical\u2014whatever it is\u2014that affects memory when humans are bitten doesn\u2019t affect me. The vampires grabbed us, dragged us away from campus, tortured Michael, and fed on me. Then I blacked out from blood loss.\u201d</p><p>Roland shook his head. \u201cVampires don\u2019t leave witnesses. Particularly female witnesses. Did you never wonder why they let you live?\u201d</p><p>She had. Every day.</p> <p>Why had they let her live and killed Michael?</p><p>That single question had spawned a nearly suffocating guilt that had never left her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, I don\u2019t remember you being there.\u201d</p><p>David leaned forward, drawing her gaze. \u201cDo you want to remember? All of it?\u201d</p><p>All these years she had thought she had remembered it. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He reached past Sean and touched the tip of his middle finger to her temple.</p><p>Nothing happened at first. Then images flooded her mind. Memories buried by either the concussion the vamps had given her in their initial attack or the drug the vamp\u2019s bite had released into her system.</p><p>A drug against which she had believed she was impervious.</p><p>She saw it all at lightning speed. Strolling hand in hand with Michael. The vampires confronting them and dragging them away. The pleasure they took in cutting and biting and torturing Michael while they made her watch. One of the vamps turning his attention on her and thrusting his fangs into her throat. Then . . .</p><p>Roland arrived, striking with a ferocity that was as frightening as the vampires, his white and purple aura contrasting with the bright orange of theirs. He tore the vampires apart, as vicious as an animal, then turned to her. The vampire feeding from her bolted. Krysta let her gaze stray to Michael, saw his chest rising and falling in pained pants.</p><p>Roland took out his phone and called for a cleanup, then started after the vampire.</p><p>Krysta caught his pant leg as he passed, clutching it with a hand that shook. \u201cP-Please.\u201d</p><p>He knelt beside her, brushed her hair back with gentle fingers.</p><p>\u201cH-help him,\u201d she begged, looking at Michael, too weak to point. \u201cS-save him.\u201d</p><p>Roland shook his head, his strong face full of compassion. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said softly. \u201cOne of them tried to turn him. If he lives, he will become a monster like them. Dying is far more merciful.\u201d</p><p>Darkness threatened.</p><p>David withdrew his touch.</p><p>Krysta stared at Roland through eyes full of moisture. \u201cYou were there.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI arrived too late to save him. He had been infected on too large a scale and, as a human, would have turned vampire. Had he lived, he would have long since lost his sanity by now.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, knowing he spoke the truth. Tears trailed down her cheeks.</p><p>Beside her, Etienne released her hand and wrapped a comforting arm around her.</p><p>\u201cThank you for saving me,\u201d she said.</p><p>He dipped his head in acknowledgment and looked from her to Etienne. \u201cI am doubly glad now that I was able to do so.\u201d</p><p>The front door opened and Chris entered, the strap of a bulging soft leather briefcase looped over one shoulder. Securing the door behind him, he headed for the table and took one of the two unclaimed chairs, leaving the chair at the opposite end of the table from David empty.</p><p>Greetings flowed around the room as Darnell took out his phone and dialed, but the call went to Seth\u2019s voice mail.</p><p>He met David\u2019s gaze as he put away the phone.</p><p>David turned his head to one side, as though listening, and closed his eyes. \u201cSeth.\u201d</p><p>Everyone exchanged glances.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d David opened his eyes and faced them. \u201cHe shall be here shortly.\u201d</p><p>Sheldon stared. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnchorage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlaska?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he could hear you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Lisette met Etienne and Richart\u2019s gazes. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing. I have to at least be in the same state to hear my brothers.\u201d</p><p>Krysta looked up at Etienne as he nodded.</p><p>David shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m older. It requires a great deal of power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awesome,\u201d Sheldon said. \u201cCan you contact any immortal that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you tell Oscar in California that I want the hundred bucks he owes me? He isn\u2019t answering his phone.\u201d</p><p>David stared at him.</p><p>Sheldon swallowed. \u201cYou aren\u2019t telling him, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Krysta\u2019s tears dried as amusement sifted through her.</p><p>Seth appeared just inside the front door, katanas in hand, his face and clothing blood-splattered. \u201cOne moment,\u201d he told them, then vanished.</p><p>Krysta heard a faucet turn on down in the basement. Rustling. The water shut off.</p><p>Seth reappeared, face and hands clean, fresh clothing adorning his tall form, weapons sheathed. He took his seat. \u201cSean,\u201d he said, \u201cI understand you wish to be transformed.\u201d</p><p>Every eye turned to Sean. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have my permission. Etienne may transform you at any time of your choosing after tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight I would like you to remain here and offer what aid you can in the infirmary in case any of the wounded come here instead of going to the network. A staff is already on hand, ready to be of service, and have been informed of your ability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I can to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not push yourself too far healing or you may not live long enough to be transformed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris?\u201d</p><p>Chris rose and, opening his briefcase, began to hand out file folders. \u201cSeth and David inspected the compound this afternoon. These are the schematics they drew. Since the tracking devices could be discovered at any moment, we need to strike tonight.\u201d</p><p>Etienne took the folder offered to him. \u201cHow do you know they haven\u2019t already been discovered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy men have been surveilling the place all day. There has been no increase in activity. Although we do believe the commander arrived just before sunset with two other men. The mercenaries all saluted him and treated him with deference and respect.\u201d</p><p>Krysta took a folder, feeling a sense of pride that she was now one of them and treated as such. Even Sean was given a folder.</p><p>Chris handed David one and rounded the table.</p><p>Marcus took a folder. \u201cDo you know who the commander is yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My men had to keep their distance to avoid compromising their mission and couldn\u2019t get a good look at his face.\u201d</p><p>Krysta studied the map. A large main building. Two hangars that shielded who knew what. Helicopters.</p><p>Marcus scowled. \u201cThis is nearly identical to the last compound we conquered.\u201d</p><p>Seth leaned back in his chair. \u201cYes, it is. There\u2019s no denying anymore that there is a connection. We just don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d</p><p>Ami bit her lip and met Seth\u2019s gaze, worry shadowing her pretty green eyes.</p><p>Seth spoke softly to her. \u201cAmi, I want you to sit this battle out. Stay here with Darnell and help him coordinate the other Seconds. And help Sean with the wounded if you can.\u201d</p><p>Ami looked up at Marcus and nodded. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJenna,\u201d Seth added. \u201cI\u2019d like you to remain here, too. You haven\u2019t completed your training and aren\u2019t prepared to face the opposition you would if you accompanied us.\u201d</p><p>Beside Richart, Jenna nodded. \u201cIf you find yourself in need of an extra pair of hands . . .\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cRichart or I will come for you.\u201d</p><p>David leaned forward and clasped his hands on the table. \u201cSince it worked well for us before, we\u2019re going to employ the same strategy we used the last time. The immortals will strike first, catching them off guard and clearing a path. Then the Seconds and network guards will sweep in behind us.\u201d</p><p>Chris nodded. \u201cI have Black Hawks, two Sisu XA-180 armored personnel carriers, and two Humvees full of men standing by a few miles from the compound. The Seconds here will accompany me to the rendezvous point in a van.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA majority of the mercenaries will likely be in the main structure,\u201d Seth said. \u201cDavid, Roland, Sarah, Marcus, Lisette, and I will tackle that. Bastien, Melanie, Etienne, and Krysta, take the barracks. Richart, Ethan, and Edward, handle the guards on the grounds, but beware of land mines and other traps. Yuri and Stanislov, take the hangers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chris held up a finger. \u201cOnce more I\u2019d like to request that you keep the vehicles intact, if possible, so that we can use them ourselves in the future.\u201d</p><p>Yuri and Stanislov both sighed with disappointment.</p><p>\u201cYou are forever spoiling our fun, Reordon,\u201d Stanislov complained.</p> <p>Seth smiled. \u201cImmortals, make sure you have several doses of the antidote on you stowed in different pockets, so if a bullet destroys one you will have another available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElder immortals,\u201d David said, \u201cKeep an eye on the younger immortals and lend them assistance when needed. Sarah and Melanie, because you possess the speed and strength of elder immortals, I include you in that category.\u201d</p><p>The two women nodded.</p><p>Melanie winked at Bastien. \u201cI get to keep my eye on you.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou always do.

Let\u2019s book.\u201d</p><p>Krysta rose and started to follow the others toward the door.</p><p>Sean caught her elbow and pulled her into a hug. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too. Like Seth said, don\u2019t overdo it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She saw Sarah tug on Roland\u2019s hand as they walked past. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t we have had siblings like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. We got screwed.\u201d</p><p>Sean laughed.</p> <p>Smiling, Krysta took Etienne\u2019s hand and followed the others out into the night.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Krysta stood with Etienne and her immortal brethren (it felt so weird to think of them that way) in the shadows of tall, fragrant evergreens. The moon was new, something that should work to their advantage. Unless the compound bore ultrabright stadium lights, there should be plenty of shadows from which immortals could strike.</p><p>Etienne tightened his grip on her hand. Keep your mind open to me.</p><p>You look nervous, she said, peering up at him. She was a little nervous herself. Are you planning to propose to me again? she teased.</p><p>He smiled. Not if your answer will change.</p><p>Krysta shook her head. It will always be yes.</p><p>He stole a quick kiss.</p><p>Feel better? she asked.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>You were worrying about me getting hurt, weren\u2019t you?</p><p>You know me well.</p><p>She liked to think she did. We\u2019ve fought mercenaries and won before.</p><p>There were far fewer to fight and you still ended up getting shot.</p><p>I\u2019m immortal now. Bullets won\u2019t kill me.</p><p>But they hurt like hell and, as I\u2019ve said before, I don\u2019t like seeing you hurt.</p><p>I am so in love with you, she professed.</p><p>I love you, too, he said, eyes acquiring an amber glow.</p><p>I know. Don\u2019t let that distract you tonight. I don\u2019t want you worrying about me. I can kick ass like the rest of them.</p><p>He raised her hand and pressed a kiss to her knuckles. As you wish.</p><p>You\u2019re totally lying and are going to worry about me anyway, aren\u2019t you?</p><p>Again, you know me well.</p><p>Seth appeared in their midst. Chris and the Seconds are in place. Time to go to work.</p><p>Stay sharp, David advised.</p><p>All nodded and drew their weapons.</p><p>Seth and David vanished. Krysta thought at first that they had teleported, then realized as sounds of their flight reached her ears that they were just so freaking fast that they had only appeared to.</p><p>Roland, Sarah, and Marcus shot off after them.</p><p>Melanie and Bastien followed.</p><p>Richart teleported.</p><p>Krysta, Etienne, and Lisette raced forward.</p><p>Ethan, Edward, Yuri, and Stanislov brought up the rear.</p><p>Anxiety filled Etienne as they whipped through the trees, feet barely touching the ground, making no sound that would alert the guards to their approach.</p><p>Krysta was a fantastic fighter and lacked nothing in the confidence department. But she wouldn\u2019t be fighting vampires this time. Her ability to see auras would not aid her as they did with vampires and . . .</p><p>He just wasn\u2019t sure how she would react to killing humans.</p><p>We\u2019re at war, she thought, and lives are at stake. Immortal. Vampire. Gifted one. And human, if these people succeed in creating their army of supersoldiers. I\u2019ll feel the same way killing them as I would if I were in the army fighting to defend my country.</p><p>How did you do that? he asked, nonplussed.</p><p>Do what?</p><p>Read my thoughts?</p><p>You were . . . what is it you call it? . . . projecting or broadcasting them.</p><p>Big-time, Lisette added.</p><p>And still he worried.</p><p>An explosion rocked the night.</p><p>The forest they navigated parted and a twenty-foot fence entwined with razor wire loomed.</p><p>Etienne leaped it easily and held his breath until he saw Krysta do the same.</p><p>An alarm sounded, wonk wonk wonking at deafening decibels.</p><p>Gunfire erupted as guards swung around to face the threat and fired blindly at the blurred figures racing through the yard.</p><p>Several soldiers cried out as Richart, Ethan, and Edward went to work eradicating them.</p><p>Bullets whizzed past and filled the air like swarms of mosquitoes. Etienne dodged as many as he could as he and Krysta followed Bastien and Melanie to the wooden structures beside the main building.</p><p>Etienne didn\u2019t know how Seth and David had gained entrance to the main building, but the brick facade looked as though a wrecking ball had hit it several times.</p><p>Screams rent the air. The scent of blood thickened on the breeze.</p><p>Etienne saw crimson liquid spurt from Krysta\u2019s shoulder and clenched his teeth.</p><p>I\u2019m fine, she said. Stop worrying about me.</p><p>Easier said than done.</p><p>Ahead of him, Bastien swore foully as Melanie burst through the door of one of the barracks without waiting for him.</p><p>Etienne headed into another, Krysta right on his heels.</p><p>Merde. This must be one the damned day guards used because the fucker was full. Men in T-shirts and boxer shorts were already leaping out of bed and grabbing weapons, having been given a few seconds\u2019 warning by the damned alarm that continued to blare outside.</p><p>Etienne never slowed. Swinging his katanas, he barreled through them like the bulls of Pamplona. Howls of pain ensued.</p><p>At the opposite end of the room, he stopped and spun around.</p><p>Krysta remained in constant motion, zigzagging from side to side as she cut down the soldiers and herded those still standing toward Etienne\u2019s deadly blades.</p><p>Two more bullets hit her. Pain erupted in her side and her thigh.</p><p>Gritting her teeth, she powered forward, glad she had chosen to wield katanas tonight rather than the shorter shoto swords. The longer blades worked well against humans with guns and seemed to scare the hell out of them at the same time.</p><p>The humans\u2019 auras took on a dark, muddied red as anger and fear seized them.</p><p>Krysta wished their auras would warn her when and where they intended to shoot, because those damned bullets stung!</p><p>She was so glad Etienne had transformed her. Had he not done so, she would be down on the floor, bleeding to death.</p><p>Etienne started working his way back toward her.</p><p>The scent of fear mingled with the strengthening odors of blood and death.</p><p>A tranquilizer dart whipped past, narrowly missing her ear.</p><p>Crap!</p><p>She singled out the shooter and . . .</p><p>Oh. She had meant to knock the weapon from his hand with a katana, but overextended herself and severed his hand.</p><p>Screaming, the soldier gripped his wrist and sank to the floor.</p><p>A bullet struck her in the shoulder.</p><p>She faltered.</p><p>Krysta! Etienne shouted mentally.</p><p>Right. She swung at the next soldier. And the next. And the next. Stepping over bodies as she methodically made her way toward Etienne.</p><p>Something stung her neck like a bee . . . and the world went black.</p><p>Etienne took out two soldiers with one swing and glanced through the shifting bodies that still fought to check on Krysta.</p><p>A dart hit her in the neck.</p><p>Her knees instantly buckled and she hit the floor hard.</p><p>\u201cKrysta!\u201d</p><p>One tranquilizer dart shouldn\u2019t have felled her like that. It should have only made her woozy. And he didn\u2019t see any other darts sticking out of her.</p><p>Krysta!</p><p>She didn\u2019t move. Didn\u2019t respond to his shout. Just lay there like a corpse.</p><p>Etienne? Lisette said. What is it?</p><p>Krysta\u2019s down!</p><p>He plowed through the soldiers, cutting as he went.</p><p>How could there still be so many?</p><p>Melanie burst through the door, zipped over, and knelt beside Krysta.</p><p>Either she had heard his mental shout or Lisette had told her Krysta needed help.</p><p>Etienne kept one eye on them as he battled the damned mercenaries.</p><p>Melanie yanked out the dart. \u201cListen to my thoughts,\u201d she called over the racket. Can you hear me? she asked as she pressed two fingers to Krysta\u2019s neck.</p><p>Yes. Something\u2019s wrong. She was just hit with the one dart. She lost consciousness instantly.</p><p>Okay. Don\u2019t panic. She\u2019s alive.</p><p>That relieved him a little. Seeing Krysta drop like that had scared the hell out of him.</p><p>Melanie delved into a pocket, withdrew an autoinjector full of the antidote, flipped the lid, and jammed it against Krysta\u2019s neck.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>Bullets peppered Etienne\u2019s chest.</p><p>Focus! David rebuked him. He and Seth must be listening in and monitoring the situation.</p><p>Etienne impaled the shooter. Dropping a sword, he grabbed the man\u2019s automatic weapon and opened fire on the soldiers rushing toward Melanie and Krysta, still swinging his other sword at the soldiers closest to him.</p><p>More bodies sank to the floor.</p><p>Krysta\u2019s eyelids fluttered, then lifted.</p><p>\u201cCan you hear me?\u201d Melanie asked her, leaning in close to draw eye contact and to be heard over the alarm and screams and sounds of battle.</p><p>Krysta nodded. Even from where he was, Etienne could see how sluggishly she responded.</p><p>\u201cCan you move?\u201d</p><p>Her hands twitched. Her feet, too. Slowly, she dragged her arms closer to her body. \u201cWeak,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Melanie delved into her pocket again and took out another autoinjector. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wait, Etienne said. He remembered Richart telling him Melanie had freaked out when Bastien had tested the antidote on himself because it was so strong it could kill an elephant. She had feared it might make his heart beat so fast that it would merely flutter instead of beating and cease pumping blood through his body.</p><p>Melanie ignored him, jamming the pen into Krysta\u2019s arm.</p><p>Krysta gasped. Eyes widening, she jackknifed into a seated position, chest rising and falling with rapid breaths.</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Melanie asked, taking her by the wrist.</p><p>Krysta nodded. \u201cMy heart is racing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny chest pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifficulty breathing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m breathing kind of fast, but . . . I think I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me know immediately if that changes for the worse.\u201d</p><p>Krysta nodded and scrambled to her feet, picking up the swords she had dropped.</p><p>Melanie caught Etienne\u2019s gaze. Tell the others the mercenaries have upped the dose. One dart will fell them so swiftly they won\u2019t have time to use the antidote. Any immortal felled should be given the antidote twice. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d she asked Krysta.</p><p>Nodding, Krysta leaped into the fray again, a big grin lighting her face. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Thank you!\u201d</p><p>Melanie darted out the door.</p> <p>Seth warned the others before Etienne had a chance.</p><p>Etienne jerked his head to the side just in time to avoid a dart.</p><p>Moments later, the last mercenary fell and Etienne raced forward to yank Krysta into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she muttered into his shirt.</p><p>He could feel how swiftly her chest rose and fell, heard her racing heart, and wasn\u2019t so sure about that. \u201cYou\u2019re practically panting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say? You turn me on,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke about this!\u201d he snapped, tightening his hold on her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said and leaned back. \u201cI\u2019m okay. Really. I think double the antidote is a little too strong, but I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m dying or anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cForgive me. I didn\u2019t mean to snap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, honey. I really am okay. I actually feel . . . great.\u201d And damned near danced in place, seeming unable to remain still. \u201cReally juiced. Like I could . . . I don\u2019t know . . . take out a helicopter or something.\u201d Laughing, she tugged him toward the door. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go. We still have lots of ass to kick.\u201d</p><p>Etienne steadied her when she nearly tripped over a body in her haste, then followed her outside.</p><p>Bastien and Melanie raced past toward the third and last barracks.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got the last one,\u201d Bastien called and plunged inside, Melanie right behind him.</p><p>Richart appeared in front of Etienne and gave Krysta a quick once-over. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked, face full of concern.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m awesome!\u201d she declared with worrisome enthusiasm.</p><p>Richart cast Etienne a dubious glance.</p><p>\u201cYou heard Seth?\u201d Etienne asked.</p><p>His brother nodded. \u201cStay safe.\u201d He vanished.</p><p>You, too, Etienne thought.</p><p>Ethan and Edward, along with Richart, steadily reduced the numbers of the guards outside.</p><p>All hell had broken loose in the hangars, judging by the sounds of it, so Yuri and Stanislov appeared to have things under control there.</p><p>Or not.</p><p>Three mercenaries fled one hangar and scrambled into a helicopter. The blades began to rotate as the engine hummed to life.</p><p>Krysta gave Etienne a huge grin, her face lighting with excitement. \u201cI\u2019m doing it!\u201d she blurted, sheathing her swords and drawing two daggers.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking out that helicopter!\u201d Whooping, she dashed away.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d He took off after Krysta. Melanie!</p><p>Yes?</p><p>Can a double dose of the antidote cause erratic behavior?</p><p>That\u2019s definitely a possibility. It\u2019s a stimulant and frighteningly strong. Why?</p><p>The helicopter lifted off the ground.</p><p>Krysta picked up speed, running damned near as fast as an elder.</p><p>Because I think Krysta has lost her damned mind!</p><p>The helicopter began to move away, strafing the yard with machine gun fire.</p><p>Krysta veered toward a Humvee, jumped onto the hood and, without slowing, leaped into the air.</p><p>Etienne nearly dropped dead of a fucking heart attack as he watched her fly through the air and dive through a side door, tackling one of the door gunners.</p><p>Fuck!</p><p>Jumping onto the Humvee, he leaped after her.</p><p>The helicopter wobbled and began to spin away.</p><p>Etienne brushed the landing gear with his fingers and latched on, pulling himself up and through a side door.</p><p>One door gunner was dead. A second soldier fell out the other side. The pilot . . .</p><p>Krysta buried a dagger in his heart as he spun toward her with a 9mm.</p><p>The helicopter tilted and spun as the pilot abandoned the controls and slumped over dead.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Etienne demanded incredulously as she turned a triumphant smile on him. He sure as hell couldn\u2019t fly this thing. And they couldn\u2019t jump without being caught in the rotors.</p><p>Her face fell. \u201cOh, shit. I didn\u2019t think of that.\u201d</p><p>Seth!</p><p>The ground rushed toward them.</p><p>Seth appeared in the helicopter and promptly bumped his head. \u201cAh! Shit!\u201d Reaching out with both hands, he grabbed their shoulders.</p><p>Etienne breathed a sigh of relief when they teleported to the tarmac in front of one of the hangars.</p><p>Fire reached toward the sky as the helicopter crashed and exploded. Pieces of the rotor blades tore off and shot through the night, taking out several more mercenaries for them.</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Seth said, pointing an authoritative finger at Krysta. \u201cCalm the fuck down!\u201d</p><p>Eyes wide, she nodded hastily. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the drug. I know. Etienne, keep her in check.\u201d He vanished.</p><p>Krysta stared up at Etienne, eyes wide. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I just did that. I\u2019m so sorry. Are you hurt? You aren\u2019t hurt, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. You just scared the hell out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said again. She hadn\u2019t thought. Energy had poured through her, demanding an immediate outlet. She had seen the helicopter and . . .</p><p>She hadn\u2019t thought. She had just acted.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked, grabbing one of her Glocks and firing over her shoulder at some threat behind her.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo chest pains?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My breathing is even beginning to slow.\u201d And rational thought was returning.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI really am sorry,\u201d she said. They could have died in that helicopter. One of the rotor blades could have decapitated them when it crashed. Or they could have burned to death in the fire.</p><p>Could fire kill immortals?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. Let\u2019s go help Yuri and Stanislov\u2014\u201d</p><p>Eyes rolling back in his head, he dropped to the pavement.</p><p>\u201cEtienne!\u201d</p><p>A dart stuck out of his shoulder.</p><p>Looking past him, she jerked to the side to avoid a dart aimed at her, then flung a dagger at the mercenary aiming his tranquilizer gun at them.</p><p>It sank to the hilt in the man\u2019s chest, felling him as quickly as the dart had dropped Etienne.</p><p>Kneeling, Krysta rolled Etienne onto his back and drew out two autoinjectors with shaking fingers. \u201cEtienne?\u201d She flipped the lids open and jabbed them into his neck.</p><p>A few seconds later he gasped. Eyes flying open, he sat up so swiftly he rammed his head into hers.</p><p>\u201cOw! Shit, your head is hard!\u201d she complained, rubbing her throbbing forehead.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, you didn\u2019t feel that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. You were tranqed. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d His chest rose and fell with rapid breaths. \u201cI\u2019m great!\u201d He leapt to his feet, a wide smile splitting his blood-painted face. \u201cLet\u2019s go kick some ass!\u201d</p><p>Krysta scrambled to her feet as he sped into the nearest hangar. \u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>Something exploded inside.</p><p>\u201cOh, crap.\u201d She took off after him.</p><p>As Seth swung his katanas with deadly precision, he heard David laugh on the other side of the building.</p><p>Seth smiled wryly, confusing his opponents. I think we may have a new problem on our hands.</p><p>It would seem so.</p><p>Have you been hit with a dart yet?</p><p>No. Strike that. Yes.</p><p>Do you need me?</p><p>No. It\u2019s a great deal stronger than the darts used against us in the past. I had to use the antidote.</p><p>Two doses?</p><p>No. One sufficed for me. The young ones must be more susceptible.</p><p>The closer Seth came to the back of the building, the thicker the soldiers grew. They were definitely protecting something.</p><p>Or someone.</p><p>A dart hit him in the chest.</p><p>Seth yanked it out.</p><p>Another hit him in the neck.</p><p>Again he yanked it out and cursed the damned hallway that allowed so little maneuvering. All the humans had to do was fire blindly in his direction and sooner or later they\u2019d hit him.</p><p>He worried anew about David.</p><p>I\u2019m fine.</p><p>Warn me if you need to use another dose of the antidote. If it juiced David up as it had Krysta and Etienne . . .</p><p>Hell, with his power, there was no telling what havoc he could wreak.</p><p>David laughed. Don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t risk it. And shouldn\u2019t have to. I\u2019ve nearly eliminated all of the soldiers over here.</p><p>Any sign of the commander?</p><p>No. And the soldiers\u2019 minds are too chaotic and plentiful to read.</p><p>I suspect I\u2019m on his trail.</p><p>Bullets continually peppered Seth\u2019s large form.</p><p>The soldiers\u2019 panic multiplied as they watched with wide eyes as every bullet that pierced him, within seconds, reemerged from his body and fell to the floor at his feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you?\u201d one shouted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The childish \u201cwouldn\u2019t you like to know\u201d taunt floated through his head, wringing another smile from him.</p><p>A smile that seemed to terrify the soldiers even more.</p><p>A mercenary ducked out of a doorway farther down and aimed a shoulder-fire missile at him. \u201cFire in the hole!\u201d</p> <p>The remaining soldiers all hit the ground as fire and smoke accompanied the missile\u2019s launch.</p><p>Seth waved a hand, directed the missile up through the ceiling, the roof, and detonated it in the night sky.</p><p>The soldier gaped.</p><p>Seth arched a brow. \u201cCare to try again?\u201d</p><p>The soldier swallowed as his comrades regained their feet.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Now why don\u2019t you show me what\u2014or whom\u2014you\u2019re hiding?\u201d</p><p>Weapons raised and resumed fire.</p><p>Through the hole in the roof, Seth saw Chris\u2019s Black Hawk helicopters swoop past. A rumbling sound, wafting through the gaping maw he and David had left in the front of the building, told him the armored personnel carriers and Humvees full of network guards had also arrived.</p><p>Enough. He needed to end this, if he could, before the humans fully entered the fray.</p><p>Ignoring the injuries constantly opening on his flesh, he cut down the remaining soldiers and eyed the door they had been defending.</p><p>Waving a hand, he slid the bodies away from it and took a step toward it.</p> <p>Wait, David said.</p><p>Seth paused.</p><p>David streaked up the hallway and stopped beside him. \u201cThe building\u2019s clear. Roland, Sarah, Marcus, and Lisette took out everyone in the basement levels and are outside lending aid wherever it\u2019s needed, so whoever is behind this door is all that\u2019s left.\u201d</p><p>There was an electronic palm pad with keys requiring a code to open the door. Seth waved a hand. Sparks shot from the gadget and a loud clunk sounded. He pushed the door inward.</p><p>Automatic gunfire resounded as bullets bombarded him.</p><p>Three men, wielding the weapons, backed away to the far side of the room.</p><p>Seth recognized two of them.</p><p>Donald and Nelson, David said, yanking the weapons from their hands with a thought and flinging them out of reach.</p> <p>Nelson drew a grenade from his pocket, pulled the pin, and threw it.</p><p>David again used telekinesis to send it out into the hallway and up through the hole in the roof Seth had created with the missile.</p><p>Show-off, Seth remonstrated as it exploded. Hold them still while I find out what we missed.</p><p>The men froze, the only movements David allowed them the rising and falling of their chests and the blinking of their eyes.</p><p>Seth delved into their minds. Was it a hard drive? A laptop? A hidden backup server? An e-mail? What had they missed? How had Donald and Nelson rediscovered vampires and immortals and begun the hunt anew?</p><p>When Seth found the answer, shock seized him.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d David asked, brow crinkling with concern.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t possible,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Seth met his gaze. \u201cTheir memories have been restored.\u201d</p><p>David stared at him, the same disbelief Seth felt writing itself upon his face. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be. We buried them ourselves.\u201d So deeply the memories could never have surfaced again on their own. Nor with drugs. Nor with hypnosis. Not even manifested in dreams.</p><p>\u201cHumans lack the ability to accomplish such a task on their own,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Rage began to simmer within him.</p><p>\u201cSuch could only be accomplished . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the help of an immortal,\u201d Seth finished for him, speaking the unimaginable.</p><p>Had one of their own turned against them?</p><p>David looked at the mercenaries in question. \u201cCan you see who did it?\u201d</p><p>The mercenaries\u2019 faces contorted with pain as Seth ruthlessly tore through their memories.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t let them live.\u201d</p><p>Seth agreed. They had only let the mercenaries live before because their PMC was elite enough that Chris had feared the deaths of both men might draw too much scrutiny. But they had no choice now. No human with any memory of this operation could be allowed to live.</p><p>Seth stopped the men\u2019s hearts.</p><p>David let them fall to the floor.</p><p>An immortal had aided the enemy.</p><p>The building around them began to tremble as Seth\u2019s control slipped, succumbing to the fury and, yes, hurt, swelling within him.</p><p>A clap of thunder split the night. Then another. Cracks opened in the walls. Sheetrock fell from the ceiling.</p><p>David reached out and rested a hand on Seth\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>They stared at each other.</p><p>Calm seeped into him from David\u2019s touch, dampening some of the fury.</p><p>Seth took several deep breaths.</p><p>The building stilled.</p><p>Utter silence reigned outside for several long minutes.</p><p>Gradually, work and conversation resumed.</p><p>David shook his head. How could any immortal betray you like this?</p><p>Betray us, Seth corrected, feeling sick. Whoever it is has betrayed us all, put us all in danger.</p><p>After you helped him adjust to his new way of life and did a thousand other things to improve his existence and foster happiness and contentment.</p><p>Or her.</p><p>David looked as ill as Seth felt.</p><p>Boots struck linoleum, carrying someone up the hallway toward them.</p><p>They faced the doorway just as Chris stopped in it, garbed in black and carrying an automatic weapon. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d he asked tentatively. Only he would have the balls to approach them now.</p><p>Seth nodded as David dropped his hand.</p><p>Wise man that he was, Chris said nothing of the thunder and tremors that had resulted from Seth\u2019s slip. \u201cAll is secure. The compound is ours and we\u2019ve already begun the cleanup.\u201d As his gaze strayed to the three dead men, he swore. \u201cSo it was them. How the hell did they regain the information? What did we miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Seth said, unable to tell him yet that they had been betrayed by one of their own.</p><p>Chris scowled. \u201cWhat do you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d David said with a shake of his head.</p><p>Chris looked from David to Seth and gave a slow nod. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>The walkie on his shoulder squawked. Chris mumbled something into it as he left and retraced his steps up the hallway.</p><p>Silent, Seth and David followed and stepped through the hole in the front of the building.</p><p>The air outside was heavy with the scents of smoke and death. The helicopter Krysta had crashed still burned. Network guards carted bodies to the hangars. More walked the fence and manned the gated entryway. The immortals . . .</p><p>The immortals clustered together about twenty yards away, smiling and laughing as Krysta recounted Etienne\u2019s antics in the hangar. Some partook of the blood Chris had brought them. None were sorely wounded. All gave the appearance of being relaxed and pleased with the victory they had achieved.</p><p>Normally, Seth would join them, slapping backs and congratulating them on a job well done.</p><p>Tonight, however . . .</p><p>Tonight he knew that one of them had betrayed him.</p><p>How could any of them be working against us? David murmured mentally.</p><p>I don\u2019t know, Seth said, already dreading the punishment he would have to deliver.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>The next day, Seth stood outside Lisette\u2019s home, procrastinating.</p><p>The sun clung to the center of the sky, no clouds creeping past to obscure its light. Birds twittered. Squirrels scuttled about in the detritus, looking for goodies.</p><p>No sounds of movement came from within the two-story domicile. If he listened closely, he could hear a single slow heartbeat and the soft sounds of somnolent breath.</p><p>Still, Seth hesitated.</p><p>He and David had agreed that only a telepath could have aided Donald and Nelson. Bastien was empathic. He could feel and manipulate other people\u2019s emotions, but he couldn\u2019t manipulate their thoughts.</p><p>Etienne and Lisette were the only telepaths in North Carolina. And there were none in surrounding states. Any telepaths farther away would\u2019ve had to have been teleported in, and a quick examination of Richart\u2019s thoughts had confirmed that he hadn\u2019t teleported any immortals into the area without mentioning it.</p><p>Seth had just left Etienne\u2019s home. He had dropped by on the pretense of checking on them both to ensure neither had suffered any lasting effects of the double dose of stimulant.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t, thankfully.</p><p>While Krysta had apologized again for the helicopter debacle, Seth had smiled and nodded and examined every nook and cranny of Etienne\u2019s mind, relieved to find nothing more incriminating than some interesting sexual fantasies he intended to pursue with Krysta.</p><p>Which left Seth standing outside Lisette\u2019s home, already dreading what he would find in her thoughts. As well as the punishment he would have to deliver when he confirmed she was the deceiver.</p><p>Although he would never admit it to anyone other than David, who knew without having to be told, Seth had a soft spot for Lisette. Female Immortal Guardians were exceedingly rare. Most female gifted ones suffered torturous deaths at the hands of vampires before they could complete their transformations. So those, like Lisette, who survived were treasured.</p><p>And Seth understood well the burden of guilt beneath which Lisette existed. He understood her, or so he had thought. Being deceived by her in such a blatant, heinous way was a blow from which he didn\u2019t think he would ever recover. He could neither forgive nor forget it.</p><p>Nor would he try to.</p><p>Hardening his heart, he rang the bell.</p><p>Lisette answered the door herself, wearing a pretty pink camisole nightgown and robe. Staying in the shadows, she squinted against the bright afternoon sunlight. \u201cHi, Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLisette.\u201d He stepped inside and waited while she closed the door. \u201cWhere\u2019s Tracy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShopping, I think.\u201d She yawned and combed her fingers through her mussed hair. He hadn\u2019t seen it unconfined by a braid in years and hadn\u2019t realized it now fell in thick waves to her hips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I woke you.\u201d</p><p>She offered him a sweet smile that broke his heart and led him into the living room. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Are you hungry? Would you like me to make you a sandwich or something?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>She sank down on the sofa and motioned to the chair across from it. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Is David\u2019s place too crowded today? You\u2019re welcome to stay here, if it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He watched her draw her long, slender legs up and tuck them under her robe. \u201cI sensed there was something you wished to tell me.\u201d</p> <p>And there it was. The unease he had expected to see cross her features when she had first opened the door to him.</p><p>While she bit her lip and hesitated, he told himself to get on with it and delved into her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cNot tell you,\u201d she said slowly, oblivious to his presence in her mind, \u201cso much as ask you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all know how powerful you are,\u201d she began. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been sort of an unspoken rule not to ask you about . . . all the things you can do.\u201d</p> <p>She had surprisingly strong mental barriers for an immortal her age, but they only slowed him down for a moment or two.</p><p>\u201cDavid wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled when we found out he could shape-shift,\u201d she mentioned.</p><p>Seth grunted. \u201cHe knew there were those who would want to turn it into a parlor trick to be exercised upon request.\u201d</p><p>She sent him a wry smile. \u201cI\u2019m sure Richart has had a hard time keeping Sheldon from asking for an exhibition.\u201d</p><p>Damn it, he wasn\u2019t finding anything about Donald and Nelson in her memories.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you want to ask me?\u201d he pressed.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like I know better now what you\u2019re capable of and . . . I just wondered . . . When we face large numbers of vampires like we did when Bastien raised his army or large numbers of mercenaries like we did last night . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just do what Zach did and give them all aneurysms or heart attacks or something? Why engage in battle at all? Why let us fight and risk our lives when you can kill them all with a thought?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d Zach. No wonder the only guilt he could find in her thoughts was that which she continued to nourish over transforming Richart and Etienne. She hadn\u2019t betrayed him. Etienne hadn\u2019t betrayed him. None of his beloved Immortal Guardians had betrayed him.</p><p>Zach had betrayed him.</p><p>Sort of.</p><p>They weren\u2019t exactly close and . . .</p><p>Actually, he wouldn\u2019t even consider Zach a friend. Not until recently, when Zach had come to him in South Korea, seeming different. Changed. He had actually aided Seth that night. Seth had taken it as a good sign and had thought . . .</p> <p>He held onto his temper enough to keep Lisette\u2019s home from shaking, but was helpless to stop the clap of thunder that rumbled outside as outrage rose.</p><p>Lisette\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have asked. It\u2019s none of my business and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Fucking Zach. Seth had suspected that the numbness was wearing off and he had been right. But that was the only thing about which he had been right.</p><p>When Seth had discovered Zach\u2019s meetings with Ami, he had hoped they might be beneficial. But Zach hadn\u2019t been drawn to Ami\u2019s goodness. He hadn\u2019t been spending hours on end, perched atop David\u2019s roof because he was curious about the relationships of those beneath it.</p><p>He had been collecting information to give Donald and Nelson.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill him,\u201d Seth growled furiously.</p><p>\u201cKill whom?\u201d Lisette asked, lowering her feet to the floor and sitting up straight.</p><p>\u201cNot important,\u201d Seth lied and forced the fury down. He rose and headed for the door. \u201cI must go.\u201d</p><p>Lisette hurried after him. \u201cSeth, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\u201d</p><p>He stopped short and turned around. \u201cYou didn\u2019t. To answer your question, there is a delicate balance that must be maintained in this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires have an unfair advantage when they prey upon innocent, unsuspecting humans. The humans can\u2019t compete with their speed and strength. We hunt vampires to correct that imbalance. When we fight humans ourselves and battle the mercenaries, there must be a balance to it. We have speed and strength. They have deadly weapons. If I exercised my powers to their full extent and killed all of the humans with a thought, we would become the equivalent of the hunter sitting up in the hunting blind, firing upon the defenseless deer that grazed below. The balance would be lost. And the consequences would be apocalyptic.\u201d</p><p>She chewed her lower lip. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean about the consequences, but I see your point about maintaining a balance.\u201d</p><p>He reached for the doorknob, but didn\u2019t turn it. \u201cLisette,\u201d he said, pausing to face her once more.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she asked, her pretty face troubled.</p><p>\u201cYou have labored long beneath the guilt of transforming your brothers.\u201d</p><p>She looked away, unhappy with the change of subject, ever unwilling to discuss it.</p><p>\u201cBut both Richart and Etienne have now found happiness. It is time for you to let go and allow yourself to seek your own.\u201d</p><p>Her slender throat moved with a swallow. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He shook his head. At himself, not at her. \u201cNor do I.\u201d</p><p>Making sure no sunlight would touch her, he opened the door and slipped outside.</p><p>Krysta stood beside her brother, the two siblings staring into the large bathroom mirror. \u201cIt\u2019s weird, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Their reflections gazed back, eyes glowing a vibrant amber.</p><p>Sean nodded. \u201cBeyond weird.\u201d</p><p>She grinned, flashing a very fine pair of gleaming fangs, inspiring Sean to do the same.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever think you would see this?\u201d he asked, snarling and making monster faces.</p><p>\u201cNo. I feared I would see this. My worst nightmare was that things would get out of control one night while I was out hunting and we would both end up being turned.\u201d She crossed her glowing eyes and made a goofy face.</p><p>Sean laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asked curiously.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cHonestly, that first year you hunted vampires, when I envisioned the future, I thought I would be dead by now.\u201d</p><p>Sobering, she turned to him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sean. For all of the pain I\u2019ve caused you over the years. For risking your life so many times in my pursuit of . . . justice or revenge. I don\u2019t know anymore which motivated me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry for secretly resenting not being the one who went out every night and did the hunting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll get to hunt now. Has Chris found you a Second?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cHe said there are three at network headquarters who just completed their training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree? So you get to have your pick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently so. He wants me to go over there tomorrow night and meet with them, hang out for a while, see which one I feel the most comfortable with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to stay here with us? Cam can serve as your Second, too.\u201d Not that she had asked him.</p><p>\u201cCam\u2019s already pulling double duty as your Second. And, honestly, it\u2019s time I had a place of my own.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cI guess I can understand that. How do you feel about having a stranger move in with you?\u201d</p><p>Living with Cam had taken some getting used to when she and Sean had moved in. Etienne, on the other hand, had been a comfortable fit from day one.</p><p>Sean shrugged. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to live together, I assume we won\u2019t be strangers for long.\u201d He gave her a boyish smile. \u201cDid I mention that one of my potential Seconds is a woman?\u201d</p><p>Her interest spiked. \u201cReally? Is she cute?\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t seen her. Chris said she\u2019s been ready to serve as a Second for a while now, but he\u2019s had a hard time placing her.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cIs she difficult? Because the last thing you need after living with me all this time is to be stuck with a bitchy woman.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou aren\u2019t bitchy. You\u2019re stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll second that,\u201d Etienne said from their bedroom down the hall. Apparently he had been following their conversation.</p><p>Krysta blew him a raspberry, then grinned when he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t difficult,\u201d Sean said. \u201cMale immortals just don\u2019t like having female Seconds because they\u2019re old-fashioned and can\u2019t bear the idea of a woman dying while protecting them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good with it,\u201d he said, straight-faced, then laughed when she hit him. \u201cJust kidding. I don\u2019t like the idea either, but Chris thought that\u2014after living with you for the past six years\u2014I might be more amenable to fighting alongside a woman. And, since I\u2019m a healer . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can heal any wounds she incurs on your behalf. Cool. I say go for it. Especially if she\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re incorrigible.\u201d</p><p>Not really. She just wanted him to find the same happiness she had.</p><p>Etienne appeared in the doorway. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d</p><p>Krysta froze. Holy crap.</p><p>She had only ever seen him naked, in sweatpants, or in his hunting clothes. This . . .</p><p>She gave him a long, leisurely look from his neatly combed hair to his feet, encased in shiny shoes that probably cost more than a semester of Sean\u2019s college tuition had.</p><p>His tall, broad-shouldered form was beautifully garbed in a black three-piece suit with silver pin stripes. A bright white shirt stood out starkly against his naturally tan, clean-shaven jaw. As she stared, he lifted his chin a bit and reached up to adjust a black and silver tie.</p><p>Daaaaaamn, he looked good.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re drooling,\u201d Sean drawled.</p><p>She nodded, never taking her gaze from Etienne. \u201cDaaaaaamn, you look good.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally good. Like . . . edible good. In fact, Sean, if you wouldn\u2019t mind giving us a few minutes alone . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Etienne\u2019s brown eyes flashed amber.</p><p>Sean sighed. \u201cNo offense, but this is one of the reasons I want my own place.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, still drinking in her fiancE. \u201cYou look hot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is for me,\u201d she professed, looking him up and down again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not overdressed, am I?\u201d</p><p>Probably, but she wasn\u2019t going to say anything. She wanted to spend the rest of the night, as Sean said, drooling over him. She\u2019d just go put on something dressy herself to even things out.</p><p>\u201cNo. I haven\u2019t changed yet. I\u2019ll be ready in a couple of minutes.\u201d As she moved to squeeze past him in the doorway, she rose onto her toes, looped her arms around his neck, and took his lips in a long, passionate, I-wish-I-could-strip-you-naked-and-have-my-way-with-you-right-here-right-now kiss.</p> <p>He groaned when she pulled away.</p><p>\u201cI mussed your hair,\u201d she murmured and left him gazing after her with glowing eyes full of desire.</p><p>And adorably mussed hair.</p><p>Forty minutes later, his hair was once more tamed, she was squeezed into a little black dress and heels, and Sean wore slacks and a dress shirt. Together, the three strode up the sidewalk in front of a modest middle-class home parked on a nice-sized plot of land in the country outside of Carrboro.</p><p>When they reached the front porch, she turned to smile up at Etienne and did a double take. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, fidgeting inside his suit jacket and smoothing a lapel. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour eyes are glowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d He closed his eyes, drew in a deep breath and let it out slowly. His lids lifted. \u201cWhat about now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill glowing.\u201d</p><p>He swore, then closed his eyes again. Breathed deeply.</p><p>Sean caught her eye and raised his brows.</p><p>Krysta shrugged. No bulge strained against the front of Etienne\u2019s slacks, so it wasn\u2019t lust.</p> <p>He opened his eyes. \u201cWhat about now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill glowing.\u201d</p><p>Again he swore and repeated the process.</p><p>\u201cSweetie, you aren\u2019t nervous, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>On the other side of him, Sean mouthed, \u201cYes, he is.\u201d</p><p>This time, when Etienne\u2019s lids lifted, they revealed warm brown eyes bereft of the glow. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She rang the doorbell.</p><p>Footsteps approached from inside. The locks turned. The door swung open.</p><p>Krysta donned a bright smile. \u201cHi, Mom!\u201d</p><p>Wings spread, Zach rode the breeze, swooping and twirling as he raced the motorcycle eating up the asphalt below.</p><p>The slender figure guiding it nearly scraped her knee on the pavement as she leaned into a curve, taking it far too fast. Her long, midnight braid flapped and danced in the wind, bouncing off the sheathed shoto swords strapped to her back.</p><p>Garbed all in black, she wasn\u2019t wearing her long coat tonight and, no doubt, would have generated a great deal of attention if any other drivers on the road could keep up with her long enough to notice the multitude of weapons she bore.</p><p>Slowing, she turned onto David\u2019s drive and stopped before the security gate.</p><p>Zach\u2019s gaze lingered on her long legs, outlined nicely by fitted cargo pants, as she straddled the bike and typed in the code.</p><p>When the gate swung open, she shot forward once more.</p><p>Zach swept his wings down, propelling himself forward and following her progress through breaks in the trees that formed a canopy between them.</p><p>Completely distracted, he nearly crashed into a large owl. Feathers flew as the owl panicked. Talons threatened. Zach banked, reversed, dodged, and lost sight of Lisette. By the time he caught up with her, she had stowed her helmet away and was striding up the walk to David\u2019s front door.</p><p>He waited until she entered, then spread his wings and gently floated down to the rooftop.</p><p>A heavy weight slammed into his middle, knocking the breath from him, breaking several ribs, and lifting him from the roof.</p><p>North Carolina vanished, replaced by icy tundra being swept clean by a blizzard.</p><p>Zach grunted in pain as his back slammed down into a glacial surface as hard as stone. Several bones in the wings he hadn\u2019t had time to retract broke, snapping like twigs. Ice pellets peppered him, stinging like needles and abrading skin left bare save his usual leather pants.</p><p>Squinting against the white, he focused on the figure kneeling above him, face dark with fury, eyes glowing gold.</p><p>Seth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you think I wouldn\u2019t know?\u201d Seth bellowed over the howling winds. \u201cDid you think I wouldn\u2019t figure it out?\u201d His large hand closed around Zach\u2019s throat and held him down.</p><p>Zach tried to teleport and couldn\u2019t. Seth must be doing something to block or hamper his gifts.</p><p>\u201cI warned you,\u201d Seth said. \u201cI warned you I\u2019ve been exercising and growing my powers while you and the Others sat on your asses. Did you think I lied?\u201d</p><p>When Zach opened his mouth to respond, Seth lifted him and slammed him against the ice again, breaking more bones in Zach\u2019s wings.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me why!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d Zach growled as agony overwhelmed him.</p><p>Lightning streaked through the sky and struck the glacier a few yards away.</p><p>He had never seen Seth so enraged.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fuck with me! Why did you restore Donald and Nelson\u2019s memories? Why did you help the mercenaries prey upon my Immortal Guardians?\u201d</p><p>Zach shook his head, unable to speak past the fingers clutching his throat.</p><p>Roaring, Seth rose to his feet and waved an arm in a circle.</p><p>The wind ceased blowing. The snow it had been carrying fluttered down to the ground, settling upon Zach and decorating his eyelashes as silence engulfed them.</p><p>Shit. Seth could control the weather?</p><p>Zach started to rise, but found he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Seth held him in place telekinetically, his power a frightening and tangible force. \u201cOnly you or an Immortal Guardian could have done it. And my immortals wouldn\u2019t betray me. Just tell me why you did it.\u201d</p><p>Zach shook his head. \u201cYour problem, Seth,\u201d he gasped, \u201chas always been . . . that you think yourself . . . invulnerable. Is it . . . so hard for you to believe . . . that one of your precious . . . Immortal Guardians might have betrayed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deny it was you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI deny nothing,\u201d he snarled, his own fury now matching Seth\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSo be it.\u201d</p><p>The blizzard resumed, wind whipping Seth\u2019s long hair.</p><p>So quickly he appeared to vanish for a moment, Seth drew a dagger and\u2014kneeling\u2014plunged the blade into Zach\u2019s chest an inch from his heart.</p><p>Pain shrieked through him.</p><p>Seth leaned in close and turned the blade, heightening Zach\u2019s suffering. \u201cListen closely, Cousin. This is but a tiny fraction of the power I wield. Betray me again, endanger my Immortal Guardian family again, and I will destroy you. If the Others don\u2019t like it and choose to confront me, they will meet the same fate.\u201d</p><p>He rose while Zach struggled for breath.</p><p>\u201cStay away from Ami. Stay away from Lisette. Stay away from all of us.\u201d He shook his head, his face full of scorn as his glowing gaze raked Zach. \u201cWhat a fucking disappointment.\u201d</p><p>He vanished.</p><p>The pressure holding Zach in place fell away.</p><p>Raising a shaking hand, Zach grasped the handle of the dagger and slowly pulled it from his chest.</p><p>It fell to the ground, staining the ice red.</p><p>He tried to teleport and found he couldn\u2019t. Seth had done something to drain his powers.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, he sat up with a growl of agony and dragged his wings with him.</p><p>A shiver shook him.</p><p>He glanced around at the frozen landscape.</p><p>No structure or shelter in sight.</p><p>For the next several hours, until his broken wings healed enough to carry him home, Zach\u2019s only company would be the anger festering inside him.</p><p>That and the satisfaction of knowing he wasn\u2019t the one who had betrayed Seth.</p><p>Apparently, somewhere out there, an Immortal Guardian was plotting to take down his or her illustrious leader.</p><p>Etienne stared at Krysta\u2019s mother and felt warmth fill him, easing some of his anxiety.</p><p>Opening the door wide, she waved them inside.</p><p>She was smaller than her daughter, standing no taller than five feet. Same slender build with slightly wider hips conservatively clothed in a floral-print dress. Shoulder-length, brown hair streaked with gray framed a friendly face that was the spitting image of Krysta\u2019s, only hers bore faint laugh lines.</p><p>\u201cHoney!\u201d she called over her shoulder, \u201cthey\u2019re here!\u201d She hugged Krysta and Sean as a man, who was at least as tall as Etienne, joined them.</p><p>He, too, bore an athletic build, garbed in slacks and a dress shirt with the sleeves rolled back. His black hair was cut short and showed gray at the temples. His expression was welcoming.</p><p>Smiling, he waited for his wife to get her hugs in, then claimed his own.</p><p>Krysta gave him a hearty embrace, then stepped back and took Etienne\u2019s hand. \u201cMom, Dad, this is Etienne d\u2019Alen\u00e7on. Etienne, these are my parents, Evelyn and Martin Linz.\u201d</p><p>Her mother smiled up at him. \u201cCall me Evie.\u201d</p><p>When she offered her hand, he took it and brought it to his lips. \u201cA pleasure to meet you, Evie.\u201d He offered his hand to Krysta\u2019s father. \u201cAnd you as well, Mr. Linz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Martin. Nice to meet you, Etienne.\u201d</p><p>Etienne\u2019s mind went blank. Two hundred plus years old and he found himself tongue-tied in the face of his fiancEe\u2019s parents.</p><p>Not surprising. He hadn\u2019t formally courted a woman since his transformation.</p><p>Evie grinned up at her husband. \u201cHe reminds me of you, honey. So handsome.\u201d</p><p>Heat stole up his neck.</p><p>Krysta\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cAre you blushing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he denied swiftly, sparking laughs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Evie motioned for them to continue through the living room and into the den. \u201cCome in and make yourself comfortable. Dinner will be ready in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Martin smiled. \u201cCan I get you something to drink, Etienne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please. Whatever you\u2019re having.\u201d</p> <p>Krysta raised her brows. It won\u2019t relax you. Alcohol has no affect on us, she reminded him as Martin crossed to a small bar in one corner and poured them both a Scotch.</p><p>I thought refusing would seem odd, Etienne said. And I want to appear as human as possible.</p><p>\u201cKrysta, do you want anything?\u201d Martin asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Martin returned and handed Etienne a glass.</p><p>Etienne ignored the urge to down it in one gulp and, instead, sipped it slowly.</p><p>Martin sipped his own, moving to stand beside his wife. \u201cSo. Should we assume by your presence here tonight that it\u2019s all over?\u201d he asked them.</p><p>Etienne looked at Krysta, not knowing what he meant.</p><p>She seemed just as confused. \u201cAll what?\u201d</p> <p>He motioned to the front of the house. \u201cWhatever inspired you to station guards around the property.\u201d</p><p>Etienne froze.</p><p>Krysta gaped. \u201cYou knew about that?\u201d</p><p>They nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney,\u201d Evie said gently, \u201cyou know I have strong empathic abilities. I could sense them out there.\u201d</p><p>Merde. How were they going to explain that?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how hard it was,\u201d Evie added, \u201cfor me to refrain from taking them some sandwiches or soda or something to help them through the long, boring hours, but they didn\u2019t seem to want us to know they were there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Krysta muttered, apparently as at a loss as Etienne.</p><p>\u201cSo? What happened?\u201d</p><p>Krysta swallowed audibly. \u201cThere was . . . a . . . uh . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cStalker,\u201d Etienne blurted. \u201cKrysta acquired an Internet stalker who lost his head over her beauty and cleverness and we feared he might harm you in his desire to get to her.\u201d</p><p>Krysta sent him a relieved smile, then nodded somberly.</p><p>Sean pursed his lips and watched his parents.</p><p>Martin looked down at Evie. \u201cI like him. He thinks fast on his feet.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>They knew he was bullshitting?</p><p>Hoping Krysta wouldn\u2019t kick his ass later, Etienne did what he had sworn he wouldn\u2019t do tonight and read her parents\u2019 minds. He had intended to let them get to know him the regular way without peeking into their thoughts and using whatever he found there to manipulate them into liking him. But he needed to know what it was they thought they knew.</p><p>Evie proved to be as difficult to read as her daughter. But Martin . . .</p><p>Etienne sucked in a breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Krysta asked.</p><p>\u201cThey know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout us? What, are you reading their minds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She turned to her mother. \u201cYou know we\u2019re engaged?\u201d</p><p>Evie\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019re engaged?\u201d Squealing, she yanked Krysta into a hug and jumped up and down. \u201cMy baby\u2019s engaged! Congratulations! We just thought you were lovers.\u201d</p><p>Sean laughed.</p><p>Etienne kept his eyes on their father.</p><p>Martin knew everything. He knew Krysta had spent the last six years hunting vampires, something she thought she had successfully kept from them. He knew Sean had helped her. He knew Etienne had saved her ass. More than once. He knew they had been battling soldiers. And he knew Etienne was immortal.</p><p>Sort of. He thought Etienne was a \u201cgood vampire.\u201d</p><p>Evie released her daughter and hugged Etienne.</p><p>Surprised, he wrapped his arms around her and gingerly hugged her back.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He met Martin\u2019s gaze. \u201cI wanted to seek your permission before I asked her, but circumstances were such that I could not,\u201d he admitted. And, damn it, his accent had just gotten thicker and his speech had reverted to the more formal tones of his youth.</p><p>Krysta eyed him curiously. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>Hell, no.</p><p>Her mother backed away, face still bright with a grin.</p><p>\u201cKrysta,\u201d Etienne asked (casually he hoped), \u201cwhat did you say your parents\u2019 gifts were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother is empathic and my dad is precognitive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can see the future?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he has been seeing yours quite clearly for some time now.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Martin. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey know you\u2019ve been hunting vampires.\u201d</p><p>Her parents nodded.</p><p>Krysta shook her head. \u201cNo, they don\u2019t. No way.\u201d</p><p>Sean cleared his throat. \u201cUm . . . Krysta . . . Etienne just said they know you\u2019ve been hunting vampires and they didn\u2019t flinch or frown or make a cuckoo sign with their fingers. They nodded. I think that pretty much confirms it.\u201d</p><p>Krysta kept shaking her head. \u201cNo. They would\u2019ve stopped me.\u201d</p><p>Her mother shrugged. \u201cWhy do you think we refused to pay your and Sean\u2019s college tuition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t refuse to pay it. You couldn\u2019t pay it. You lost everything when the stock market tanked in 2008.\u201d</p><p>Evie waved a hand in a pshaw gesture. \u201cMartin saw that coming from a mile away, as well as the value it would regain over the next few years. We\u2019re actually quite wealthy now. But we knew the only way we could reduce the time you spent risking your life hunting vampires was to ensure that you had to work as many hours as possible to cover rent and help Sean pay his tuition after you dropped out your junior year.\u201d</p><p>Martin nodded. \u201cI didn\u2019t foresee Michael\u2019s death, baby. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He met Etienne\u2019s gaze. \u201cBut I did foresee Etienne and how happy he would make you.\u201d He smiled at Krysta. \u201cIf we had come up with a way to keep you from hunting vampires, you never would have met him. So we settled for doing what we could to limit your hours, so to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m immortal,\u201d Etienne asked, hardly able to believe it, \u201cand still approve of our impending marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he responded simply.</p><p>Evie nodded. \u201cSo?\u201d She turned to Krysta and Sean and rubbed her hands together with anticipation. \u201cLet\u2019s see \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>Krysta and Sean exchanged a glance.</p><p>\u201cSee what?\u201d Krysta asked.</p><p>\u201cYour fangs.\u201d</p><p>The siblings looked equally astonished.</p><p>\u201cYou know about that, too?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get a glimpse of them ever since you arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not upset?\u201d Krysta asked.</p><p>\u201cThat we don\u2019t have to worry about our children ever getting sick or dying? That you\u2019ll be young and healthy forever? No.\u201d</p><p>Martin nodded. \u201cOr that you\u2019ll both spend eternity with someone you love? Someone who makes you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Evie said again.</p><p>\u201cHell, no,\u201d Martin seconded.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Sean said. \u201cAre you saying I\u2019m going to marry an immortal, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Martin stated with confidence.</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never seen her outside of the visions.\u201d</p><p>Evie leaned toward her children and waggled her eyebrows. \u201cSo? What are you waiting for? Flash me some fangs.\u201d</p><p>Krysta and Sean exchanged another glance, then peeled their lips back from their gums, let their fangs descend, and snarled.</p><p>Evie clapped, her eyes bright with excitement.</p><p>Smiling, Martin again offered his hand to Etienne. \u201cWelcome to the family.\u201d</p><p>Etienne shook it, not needing precognition to know he would enjoy being part of it.</p><p>Krysta caught his eye and winked as she continued to growl and ham it up for her mother. I love you.</p><p>He smiled. I love you, too.</p><p>\u201cOoh! Marty, look!\u201d Evie said with excitement. \u201cHer eyes are glowing! Isn\u2019t she pretty?\u201d</p><p>Etienne laughed as Krysta rolled her glowing eyes. </p> </body></html>"]
