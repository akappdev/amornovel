She should know better than to taunt me, which is what she\u2019s done all day.</p><p>The moonlight shines through her window, giving me a perfect view of her. Not that I need one. The image of her is branded into my brain, just like everything else about her. She\u2019s an obsession that seems to grow more and more every day.</p><p>Lying on her back, her legs are spread just enough to get a nice peek at the pussy into which I\u2019m going to unload all my cum. My balls ache, they feel so full. Reaching down, I pull myself from the black gym shorts I've already leaked a little cum into, the head of my cock glistening. I grab my balls and give a little tug, but it does nothing to stop the ache. No, but her pussy will.</p><p>Why shouldn't it? She\u2019s the reason for it. Since she came stumbling into my life a little more than four days ago she's been taunting me. Well, she\u2019s about to learn what happens when you taunt a man. I'm not one of those dipshit high school boys she's used to, the ones who probably do everything she asks in hopes of getting her into bed. I\u2019ll take what I want from her, and she really needs to understand the difference between a boy and a man.</p><p>Her chest rises and falls with soft breaths as she lies there sleeping, her big tits straining against her tee, her hard nipples trying to break free. She looks like a sexy innocent angel that was sent to bait a man\u2019s will, and she has. She has no clue of the predator standing over her while she sleeps. Maybe she thought she was safe from me because her parents are asleep down the hall in their own bed.</p><p>I\u2019m on her before she can react, one hand over her mouth, the other around her throat. I can\u2019t chance her parents catching me in the act if they hear her. Her legs spread wider for me, and I feel her pulse pick up in her throat, but she doesn\u2019t try to scream. My cock is already rubbing against her pussy, the wetness turning me on even more. It takes me a moment to catch it, but I realize that it\u2019s too wet to just be my cum leaking from my cock\u2014something that seems to happen when she\u2019s near me.</p><p>She\u2019s wet. No, she\u2019s fucking primed and ready for me. I tighten my grip around her throat a little more, and I growl in her ear, her soft blonde curls tickling my face, \u201cYou better have been dreaming about me.\u201d The idea that she could\u2019ve been thinking about someone else drives me fucking nuts. I didn\u2019t know jealousy until she came into my life.</p><p>When I feel her nod in agreement, I release my hand around her throat and replace it with my mouth. The need to leave a mark on her rides me hard. She moans into my hand, making me suck her harder. Yeah, that will definitely leave a mark. Look at me, like a fucking high school kid leaving a hickey, sneaking into her room at night. I\u2019d never marked a woman in my life. I can\u2019t wait to walk past her tomorrow and see it on display. Everyone will know she belongs to someone.</p><p>Using my free hand, I push her tee up to grab onto one of her tits. I didn\u2019t know an eighteen-year old could have tits as big as hers, but the proof is in my hand. I knead and pull on one, making the nipple even harder. Her legs spread wider for me, begging me to take her.</p><p>I should make sure she's completely ready to take me, eat her sweet cunt until her juices cover my face, but I can't. I have no control left. It all left the second her phone rang after dinner tonight while we were cleaning up the dishes. Her parents were still in the room so I couldn't react. I had to stand there and listen to her take a call from the high school quarterback, Croy, and agree to go to the Homecoming dance with him because, as she put it, \u201cNo, I'm not going with anyone already. I don't have anyone in my life right now.\u201d I knew the last part was just for me. She stood there with a smirk on her face, one of her perfect little dimples showing, but her eyes were pissed. They had been for the past three days.</p><p>It's like my cock knows where it belongs. Slipping through her pussy lips as it slides right home, thrusting to the hilt and her tight little pussy clenching around my dick. I close my eyes, trying to get myself under control, but she pushed me too far. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll fuck her so hard she won\u2019t be able to walk tomorrow.</p><p>I look down into her eyes. Not even a trace of fear. Here I am, looming over her in the middle of the night, and I think I just played right into her hands. Not that I can blame her. I had pushed her away, but I think she thought I meant pushing her away for good. I hadn\u2019t. No, I was just trying to get my head back on straight, figure out how I was going to get us out of this mess we\u2019d made before it crashed down all around us.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine. Have been from the moment I laid eyes on you, since I sank into you Saturday night, took your cherry and claimed you. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>She nods her head again, removing my hand from her mouth. I don\u2019t give her the opportunity to speak because I know questions will pour from her mouth. I still don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, or what is going to happen. All I know is that she is mine. I take her mouth with mine. Slow and sweet, letting her know this is more than just getting off, that I\u2019ve missed her, and that she has driven me to the edge. She soon takes over, thrusting her tongue into my mouth, clinging to me like she never wants to let go.</p><p>I feel her trying to move her hips, wanting me to move with her. I\u2019m barely hanging on to my control, and it doesn\u2019t help when she comes at me like she\u2019s starved. I release her mouth and flip us over, but before she can protest, I plunge my cock inside her.</p><p>\u201cRide me. Show me how much you want me.\u201d I\u2019ve never sought out a woman\u2019s attentions before. I didn\u2019t have to, and I never craved the need to know one wanted me, but with her I need it. I love seeing how much she wants me. It\u2019s like an addiction. I feel like a puppy begging for a scrap. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her hand lands on my chest, and she stares down at me wide-eyed, probably because she\u2019s never done this. The first and only time we\u2019d ever had sex, when I took her cherry, I was on top, the one in control. Now I\u2019m giving it to her. Not that she really has it. I grip her wide hips, my fingers digging into her soft skin, and I move her. I love that she has no idea what she\u2019s doing. Who knew that could be such a fucking turn on? I\u2019ll teach her everything she\u2019ll know about sex.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take her long to see how I want her to move. She slides back and forth on my cock, her juices coating me more. She looks like a goddess on top of me. Her hips sway, her tits softly bouncing, her nipples hard and begging for my attention, her head thrown back, her curly blonde hair so long it brushes my balls as she rides me.</p><p>Releasing one of her hips, I slide my fingers between her pussy lips, finding her hard little clit. Her body jerks in response, her juices covering me, making me wish I\u2019d had the control to have eaten her cunt before I took her. I could have her taste on my mouth right now.</p><p>\u201cTell me you're mine. No one else touches you.\u201d I need her to reassure me after the little stunt she pulled tonight.</p><p>She responds instantly. \u201cI\u2019m yours, only yours.\u201d</p><p>I strum her clit a little faster, her words almost sending me over the edge. I need her to cum, for her to milk my release out of me.</p><p>\u201cThen cum for me. Work all that cum out of my cock. Take me deep inside you,\u201d I grunt. I marked her neck, now I want to make that same mark inside her; cover the walls of her pussy with me.</p><p>I feel her pussy tighten, and I know she is going to go off. I rise and pull her to me, catching her mouth with mine, swallowing the sounds of her orgasm. Her body jerks against me as I cum hard, deep inside her. Just when I think I\u2019ve emptied all I can into her, my cock jerks again, releasing a little more inside her.</p><p>She collapses onto my chest, and I wrap my arms around her. \u201cI missed you so much,\u201d she says so quietly I almost don\u2019t hear her. I\u2019m not even sure she knows she said it. Her breaths grow deeper, and I know she has fallen fast asleep.</p><p>I\u2019d thought I could just touch her a little, give her what she wanted, but not fully take her. I was fucking shocked that first night when I\u2019d gotten her sweet pussy underneath me, only to realize it was untouched. It wasn\u2019t bad enough I was fucking my friend\u2019s barely legal daughter in his own house while he was sleeping down the hall, but I was also taking her cherry.</p><p>I should have walked away, but it was too late. I\u2019d already tasted her, and nothing would have stopped me from seeing her virgin blood coat my cock as I pumped in and out of her, filled her with my cum until it dripped down her ass and covered my sheets\u2014sheets I stripped from my bed afterwards and kept.</p><p>I was past the point of no return, and I don\u2019t know why I ever tried to fight it. I\u2019ll never forget the day she walked into my life and flipped it upside down.</p><p>2</p><p>Chris</p><p>4 days earlier</p><p>\u201cCan I help you with something?\u201d I ask Phil on my way out to the back deck, taking a long swig from my beer. He\u2019s grilling steaks for a family cook out. His daughter Megan is set to come home any minute, having spent the summer at a creative writing camp.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m all set, Chris. Just ready for Megan to get home. I hate that the camp fell on her eighteenth birthday, but at least we get to celebrate it now that she\u2019s coming home. Her friend\u2019s mom is dropping her off soon. Hopefully she\u2019ll like the party,\u201d he says flipping the steaks on the grill.</p><p>Sitting on one of the patio chairs, I stretch my legs out. The beer is perfect after having spent the whole day out in the heat. Two days on the football field can be killer in the Texas heat. I\u2019m just glad I have a place to crash, and I\u2019m not sitting in some hotel room after a long day at work.</p><p>Phil and I have been friends since I was in college. I played football at Texas Tech, and met Phil when he was doing his clinicals. Part of his job was to see to the football players, and my knee wasn't the best so we spent a lot of time together. He and I hit it off right away, even though he was ten years older than me. He always gave me great tips on how to keep my body in working condition.</p><p>After I graduated from college, I went on to the pros, playing center for the Houston Texans. I played until my knee finally blew out. Phil did the best to try to get my knee back in shape, but we both knew I was playing on borrowed time as it was. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have lasted as long as I did. He fixed me as best as he could, but I\u2019d done some real damage. There was too much wear and tear, and if I went back on the field, I was taking a chance of never being able to walk again. It was a tough decision, but retiring was the right choice. I\u2019d made a lot of money in my years there, saving and investing the best I could. I knew my knee could\u2019ve gone at any minute, and it was time to hang up my jersey.</p><p>\u201cThanks for being here with us today. I know you\u2019re ready for your place to be finished.\u201d</p><p>I was, but Phil and Janet\u2019s home wasn\u2019t a bad place to crash for a while. It was huge, plus I got to talk football every night, and I could bounce ideas off him. Better than going home to an empty house, something that had been bothering me lately.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed the summer with you and Janet, and I know you\u2019re both probably ready for me to get out of your hair,\u201d I joke, knowing they would have had the house all to themselves this summer if I hadn't been staying here.</p> <p>\u201cAre you kidding me? It\u2019s been awesome having someone to talk football with nonstop. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what you\u2019re going to make of the Wildcats this season.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I raise my beer and knock it against his. \u201cHere\u2019s hoping my first year as a high school football coach is a winning season.\u201d</p><p>I had been talking to Phil one day, telling him how much I missed being a part of the sport, even though I didn\u2019t have the urge to play anymore. He told me his local high school was looking for a new head coach and I would be a perfect fit. Not soon after, I interviewed, got the job instantly, and made the move. Only my new house wasn\u2019t finished so Phil offered to let me crash with them this summer while I waited.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drink to that. Oh, and to your house being finished next week,\u201d he laughs and we clink bottles.</p><p>\u201cRemind me never to build again. It\u2019s taken them a month longer than they said, but they\u2019ve guaranteed it by next Friday. Either way, I appreciate you letting me stay with you this summer. It\u2019s clear those boys needed me here as soon as possible; they were a fucking mess. I thought I was going to have to do three a days if that\u2019s even possible.\u201d</p> <p>Phil lets out a laugh as he closes the grill lid. \u201cNo problem. Megan was gone the whole time, so someone needed to fill the silence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa ha. Whatever,\u201d I say, rolling my eyes. He and his wife have been far from quiet. I\u2019m not sure if they always go at it like that or if it is because their kid is out of the house. \u201cI\u2019ll go check out front and see if she\u2019s back. Wouldn\u2019t want you taking your eyes off the grill. Remember the last time you got distracted?\u201d I say this as Janet comes up behind him and puts her arms around his waist.</p><p>\u201cI remember having to order out because the steaks were so burned. Good thing I didn\u2019t marry you for your grilling skills.\u201d</p><p>Phil turns around and scoops her up, kissing her lips. I take that as my cue and walk out. I\u2019ve tried to give them their privacy this summer, but I can\u2019t help but see them in moments like this and feel a spark of envy. I\u2019ve never felt that way about a woman before. Never had a single thought of wanting something like that.</p><p>They are older than me, so I keep telling myself I have time, but at thirty years old, one would think I\u2019d have felt something close to love. As it is right now, I just fuck to get off, and the women I\u2019ve been with know the score. When I played college and pro, I kept my head in the game, even when it was off-season. I knew after I was done playing football I could try for something like that, maybe have a family, but it\u2019s been a year since I left and I\u2019ve still not felt any pull to want that with a woman.</p> <p>As I walk through the living room, I look at all the birthday decorations, eyeing a Star Wars cake in the middle of the table. What kind of eighteen-year-old girl would have a Star Wars cake? Maybe there was a mix-up at the store. Taking a step closer, I see Megan\u2019s name written across it in pink icing. The last time I saw her was when she was eight years old, trying to get me to buy her Girl Scout cookies. I\u2019m happy I get to see her again after all this time. I wonder if she looks like her mom. If so, I\u2019m sure Phil has his hands full. It\u2019s probably why he sent her off to that creative writing thing. Janet is tall, with legs for days, tanned skin, dark hair and bright blue eyes that stand out against her complexion. If Megan looks even a little like her mom, Phil is in trouble with the boys from school.</p><p>I walk around the corner, thinking about their little family, and run into straight into a woman. The collision knocks us both down on the ground, and I land on top of her. I brace myself, trying to make sure she doesn't take the impact of my weight. I\u2019m not a small guy, and I still carry all of the muscle I needed playing center in the NFL.</p><p>\u201cOh shit, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I say, pushing up on my arms and looking down at her. Suddenly, my cock goes hard as a rock as I see this knock-out under me. It's like I\u2019ve never had a chick this close before. Blonde waves frame her face as ice-blue eyes look up at me through thick-framed glasses. Her soft full curves press against me in the best way possible, and all I can think about is how she\u2019s so soft.</p><p>She raises an eyebrow and spreads her legs a little wider. It\u2019s then that I realize our position, me between her legs and her spread out under me. \u201cWow. Don\u2019t apologize,\u201d she says, her cheeks turn a little pink, but a smile forms on her face, showing two perfect dimples.</p><p>This must be the friend who was dropping off Megan, and though I want to stay in this position, I don\u2019t want Phil's daughter walking in and seeing us this way. I sit up, pulling her with me and helping her off the hardwood floor. Her arms go around my neck instantly, like she misses being pressed up against me. Who am I to turn down an invitation like this from the hottest woman I\u2019ve ever seen in my life? That\u2019s saying a lot with all the groupies and jump-offs I had running around me when I played pro. I turn us both so we are in the shadows in the hallway, blocked off in case anyone happens to walk by. She presses her hips to my groin, pushing her body against my hard cock. Her softness fits me perfectly. She\u2019s so tiny compared to me in height, but her curves let me know she could handle me. Like I said, I\u2019m not a small guy, so I could grab onto her and not have to worry.</p><p>I feel the heat between us light up fast, and I need to know more about this chick. \u201cSo I shouldn\u2019t apologize for knocking down a gorgeous woman?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot if you\u2019re going to greet her like this,\u201d she breathes, rubbing her body against mine a little more. Her actions are bold, but her cheeks redden even more. Shit, she looks innocent like that.</p><p>Jesus, who is this chick? Fuck if I\u2019m not harder than I have ever been in my life, and that\u2019s just from being pressed up against her. Her smell, her softness, everything is pulling me in. I feel like I\u2019m drowning in desire. Maybe it\u2019s been too long since I\u2019ve been with a chick. My mind has been so focused on my new job that women haven't even been a blip on my radar. Some of the teachers have been trying to throw themselves at me since I started, but I didn\u2019t have time or inclination. But this little curvy bundle of softness has got my attention. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMegan?\u201d I hear Phil calling from the back of the house. I feel the woman in my arms freeze, no longer rubbing up against me.</p><p>\u201cHey, we better get out there before Megan walks in. Give me your number. I want to see you again,\u201d I say, looking down and searching her eyes, but her big-framed glasses hide them from me. Shit. I can\u2019t remember the last time I asked for a chick\u2019s number. Normally they are slipping them to me, but no way am I letting this one get away. Something about her feels different. Feels right.</p><p>The woman giggles and leans up on her tip toes, licking my neck and giving it a small bite, like she needs a taste of me. I nearly cum in my pants, and just as I\u2019m about to, she pulls back, ducks under my arm, and walks down the hallway. I watch her go, feeling like I just got hit by a linebacker, and before I know it, I\u2019m following behind her, watching her ass wiggle.</p><p>\u201cMegan! There you are!\u201d I see Phil scoop up the woman, giving her a big hug. Then I hear Janet scream \u201cMegan!\u201d while wrapping her arms around the two of them. The family of three embrace, and I\u2019m just standing there with my jaw on the floor.</p> <p>Well, fuck.</p><p>After a second I shake the fog away and grit my jaw, making sure I wipe the confused look off my face before anyone notices. I think about what could have just happened. I should apologize to Megan, to her family, but I can\u2019t find the will right this second to mean it. I\u2019ve never been so struck by a woman before, and it\u2019s laughable considering she literally struck me.</p><p>Phil and Janet turn to look at me. \u201cMegan, do you remember Chris, an old friend of mine? He took the head football position at your high school.\u201d</p><p>Her nose scrunches at Phil\u2019s words. I step forward and hold my hand out and she takes it. \u201cGood to see you again, Megan.\u201d I rub the inside of her wrist with my finger, feeling her pulse pick up.</p><p>\u201cHmm, it\u2019s good to see you too. Not sure I remember you, though.\u201d I study her for a second, not really shocked she doesn't remember me. It was over ten years ago and we only met once. I never hung out with Phil at home because I was usually on the road.</p> <p>\u201cMegan doesn't care much for football, or sports for that matter so she might avoid you like the plague,\u201d Phil jokes, and I almost want to laugh at his words. If he only knew what happened moments ago. That was definitely not avoidance.</p><p>Regretfully, I release her hand, and Janet pulls Megan toward the back deck. As they go, she looks back over her shoulder at me, one of her dimples showing, and her blush returns. My dick twitches, and I curse under my breath. I storm to the bathroom and splash some cold water on my face, trying to get my head straight. I look in the mirror and give myself a pep talk. \u2018Jesus, Chris, she\u2019s your best friend's daughter, and she\u2019s barely eighteen. Get it together.\u2019 I reach down and adjust my cock, trying to hide the fact that the thick bastard is hard as a rock and ready to fuck.</p><p>When I make my way out back with the family, I look over and see Megan saying hello to everyone who\u2019s come to celebrate her homecoming and birthday. I grab my beer from the patio table, retake my chair and just watch her.</p><p>It\u2019s then I realize how young she really does look. When she was pushed up so close against me I couldn\u2019t see all of her, more just feel her.</p><p>Her long blonde hair hangs in waves to her ass. Her bright blue eyes are partially hidden behind her oversized glasses, so I can only catch a glimpse of them here and there. She wears a shirt that fits tight to her tits and reads: I never received my acceptance letter from Hogwarts, so I'm leaving the Shire to become a Jedi! Whatever the fuck that means, I have no idea. She has on loose jeans that she\u2019s rolled at the cuff, and simple white tennis shoes.</p><p>If she wasn\u2019t so curvy I would think she was trying to downplay her looks. It\u2019s almost like she rolled out of bed and just threw something on. Not something that typical of a young woman. I can't keep my eyes off her as she moves around the backyard, talking to people and saying her hellos. She glances over at me every so often and as time goes on she gets bolder whenever she looks, her glances lingering.</p> <p>I try not to stare at her, but it\u2019s hard. Looking around, I start to notice that everyone here is my age or older. Shouldn\u2019t this place be loaded with other teenagers? I just push it to the back of my mind, thinking maybe it\u2019s just for adults, and Megan will have another party with her friends later.</p><p>\u201cCoach Burns.\u201d I pull my eyes away from Megan at the sound of my name. I see Croy, my starting quarterback, standing in the doorway of the back porch. \u201cYou said I could stop by and grab that playbook,\u201d he says before I can ask what he needs.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll go grab it.\u201d I completely forgot he was stopping by, and I\u2019m sure that has something to do with the woman I can\u2019t seem to keep my eyes off of. \u201cWait here. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Making my way upstairs, I grab the playbook off the desk in my room, but stop outside Megan\u2019s door. I\u2019ve never had the desire to open it before, but I find myself pushing it open now. I\u2019m not sure what I expected to find, maybe pink walls, fluffy pillows, and posters of teenage heartthrobs on the wall, but what I get is something completely different. Her walls are a bright green, with a model of the solar system hanging from the ceiling. Books cover every free space. Three computer monitors sit on her desk, a screensaver of the periodic table divided across the screens. Her walls are indeed covered in posters, but I don\u2019t understand half of the slogans and phrases emblazoned across them. The one that says \"Dear Nasa, Your Mom Thought I Was Big Enough\u201d gets a bark of laughter from me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019s a dork. And fuck, why does that turn me on even more? Get it together, Chris. Shutting her door, I try to push all thoughts of Megan out of my head. Off limits. I tell myself again. When I get back to the deck, I look around for Croy, and my jaw tightens when I spot him. Megan has her back pushed to the wall of the house, and I see Croy leaning into her, his hand resting beside her head. She\u2019s smiling at whatever he is saying.</p><p>I have the sudden urge to punch him right in the face, which is contrary to what I\u2019ve been doing all summer: making sure his ass doesn\u2019t get hurt so our season doesn't go to shit. Wouldn't look too good if the coach punched the starting quarterback right in his pretty-boy face.</p><p>\u201cAnderson!\u201d I snap his last name like we\u2019re at practice, and it achieves the effect I want. He snaps to attention, looking like a deer in headlights. \u201cHere\u2019s your book. Now get your ass home and get some rest. We had a long day today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Coach,\u201d he says, but not before he turns and tugs a strand of Megan\u2019s long hair. \u201cSee you Monday.\u201d</p><p>My grip tightens on the playbook, but he releases her hair and makes his way over to me before I can snap at him again. Handing it over, I resist the urge to tell him to stay away from Megan, who\u2019s just staring over at us. I wish I knew if it was me or Anderson she had that dreamy look in her eyes for.</p><p>Croy makes his departure, and Megan continues to stare at me. Fuck, I can\u2019t do this. I break eye contact and walk back over to where I was sitting. I go through the motions for the rest of the night\u2014staying long enough to eat and sing happy birthday so I don\u2019t seem like a dick for bouncing out too soon.</p><p>I make the excuse of a long day out on the field with the boys, and head to bed. I debate masturbating; my cock is still hard from watching Megan bounce around the backyard all night. She would sometimes huff out a laugh that would turn into a snort, making her blush with embarrassment, and fuck me, if that didn't get me hard too. I decide against rubbing one out. I know I\u2019d think about her while I did it, and that wouldn't help the urge I was struggling to keep away. I\u2019ll just go without as a little self-punishment. Stripping out of my clothes, I climb into bed, letting images of a curvy blonde play through my mind as I slowly drift off.</p><p>It\u2019s not long after when I hear a click, and my eyes pop open, unsure of what the noise was. I wait a second, and when I don\u2019t hear anything else, I start to drift back off.</p><p>Moments later, I feel the blanket shift, and my eyes fly open. I see Megan standing beside the bed, her hand creeping under the bedclothes.</p><p>Reaching out, I grab her wrist, pulling her close to me. A gasp escapes her lips, and she\u2019s probably shocked by my fast movement. My heart starts racing, but I want to be quiet so her parents don\u2019t hear us.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I whisper, looking over to the door. I see that it\u2019s locked. Megan must have flipped the lock when she snuck in. Her parents are just down the hall, and they could hear us if we\u2019re too loud.</p><p>She leans in and whispers just as quietly into my ear. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep. I thought maybe...\u201d</p><p>Her words trail off, but I feel her hand run across my naked chest and down my stomach. It\u2019s then I realize where her hand is headed, and I\u2019m not wearing any underwear. I like to sleep naked in the summer, and I\u2019m thinking that wasn\u2019t the best decision with her in the house, but my cock has been hard all night, pressed against my pants, and I\u2019d wanted to let it breathe.</p><p>\u201cYou need to go back to your room,\u201d I say through gritted teeth, but I don\u2019t let go of her wrist or push her away. I look down and see she\u2019s wearing an oversized t-shirt with the neck cut out, so it hangs off one shoulder, exposing her collarbone to me. I\u2019m so fucking hard at being this close to her, seeing her skin, and smelling her sweetness. I breathe deeply and I catch a hint of something more, something that smells like desire. I close my eyes tightly and try to be strong. \u201cLeave, Megan, or you\u2019ll be sorry you stayed.\u201d</p><p>Her hand pushes forward under the covers, and I feel her fingertips touch my dick. Cum starts to seep out of the tip at this slight touch, and I have to hold it back to keep from cumming.</p><p>\u201cMegan,\u201d I warn, but she doesn\u2019t stop. Instead, she leans closer to me, putting her neck against my mouth and grabbing my cock under the covers. I moan at the sensation, but lean back to try to break free. As I do, she puts a knee on the bed, making her t-shirt rise, and opens herself to me. I can smell her pussy, and my mouth starts to water. Her juices must be coating her legs, and I look down, seeing her teenage cunt open and ready, begging to be taken.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Coach Burns. I need this. I know you want me. I want this too.\u201d She pauses for a minute, as if she\u2019s looking for the right words. \u201cI want to get off, and get you off too.\u201d</p><p>I look into her eyes, and scoot back in the bed. I\u2019ve never been tempted like this before, and goddamn do I want to sink inside her. I look to the door, double checking that it\u2019s locked, and think it over. I could do this. I can just get her off and she can leave. I\u2019ll jerk off about a dozen times after, but I can make this quick. It\u2019s the only way to get her to go, and we don\u2019t want to be caught. I\u2019ll do this for her and she\u2019ll go, I lie to myself. \u201cFine. But you\u2019ll be quiet. I don\u2019t want your parents finding out. And this stays between us, right?\u201d I look into her eyes. They\u2019re finally free of her glasses and look so much bigger and brighter now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI promise not to tell.\u201d She puts her other leg on the bed, and gets in, lying down beside me. I pull the covers back, exposing my naked body, and she pulls up the hem of her t-shirt, showing me her wet cunt. \u201cYou can take me if you want to. That can be our little secret too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Her words make more cum leak out of me, and all I can imagine is dumping a load inside her young pussy. I want to wear her cunt out and make her remember who's been there. I have this urge to mark her like she\u2019s mine, but I know I have to hold myself back. She might be eighteen and legal, but I still work at the school she goes to, and her father is a good friend to me. \u201cI\u2019m getting you off. That\u2019s it.\u201d I shoot her a hard look so she knows that\u2019s all we\u2019ll be doing.</p><p>Megan bites her lip and nods her head, reaching down between her legs, spreading her swollen lips open for me. She\u2019s baiting me. Her clit is soaked with her sticky cream, and I move to get between her thighs, my mouth watering. Before I put my mouth on her I look up into her eyes. \u201cOur secret, right?\u201d</p><p>She nods her head, and I latch onto her cunt, sucking up her sweetness and eating her out. She starts to moan, and I reach up, putting a hand over her mouth. She puts her hands over mine to help muffle her cries as I drink down her juices, licking inside her cunt to get it all. I want every last drop of her. She\u2019s the sweetest thing I\u2019ve ever tasted, and the more I eat her, the harder I get. I\u2019m humping the sheets, trying to find relief, but the more I taste, the more I want.</p><p>While sucking her clit, I brace her thigh open with one hand, still holding the other over her mouth. It doesn\u2019t take me long before she starts to grind against my face, her back bowing off the bed. I feel her cum against me, and like an animal I want more. I pull back and lick my lips. \u201cAnother.\u201d I whisper, and go back to sucking on her cunt. I want to see her cum again.</p><p>She gives me another orgasm moments later, and before I know what I\u2019m doing, I\u2019m on top of her, the tip of my cock at her opening. I wonder if that Croy fucker has ever seen her like this before. The thought almost sends me over the edge. She\u2019s been so forward with me that I can\u2019t imagine her lacking for male attention.</p><p>I\u2019ve become possessed by the need to mark her as mine so that no one else can ever touch her again. I want her for me and me alone from this day forward. I\u2019m beyond caring that she\u2019s off limits. I need to fuck her. Now.</p><p>\u201cYou're going to take me inside.\u201d I mean it as a question, but it comes out more like a statement. I can\u2019t seem to get myself under control with her.</p><p>\u201cYes, Coach. I need you.\u201d She pushes her hips up a little, inviting me in.</p><p>I lean down and kiss her full lips, letting her sticky juice slide between our tongues. She moans at her flavor. Knowing the taste of her own pussy turns her on. It turns me on too. I thrust hard inside her, giving us both what we want, and as soon as I plunge all the way inside her, I pull back to look at her, my eyes wide. I felt a barrier break as I thrust in, and it hits me.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Megan. You\u2019re a virgin?\u201d</p><p>Red blossoms on her cheeks, and she nods her head slightly. I can see little tears start to form in the corners of her eyes, and it nearly breaks my heart.</p><p>\u201cOh God, baby, don\u2019t cry. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I feel like an asshole. I should have been gentler. I never thought she could be a virgin with the way she\u2019s been acting, but knowing I\u2019m the only man to have been inside her makes me almost cum on the spot.</p><p>I lean down and kiss her cheeks, holding her to me, trying to comfort her and doing my best to keep myself from embarrassing myself by unloading all my cum into her. Fuck, I shouldn\u2019t be doing this. I\u2019m balls-deep in untouched pussy, and I can\u2019t make myself pull out. She\u2019s squeezing me tighter than anything I\u2019ve ever felt, and all I can think about is fucking her hard and deep to try to break her in.</p><p>I look into her eyes, and she gives me a little smile. \u201cYou want me to pull out, baby? This should\u2019ve been better for you. We shouldn\u2019t be doing it like this.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes get big, and she shakes her head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t stop. I want this. I want you. Don\u2019t you feel it?\u201d She puts her hand on my heart, and I know what she means. The connection between us is real.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not on any birth control, are you?\u201d I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t remember to put on a condom, something I'd never done in my whole life. Fuck, she has me twisted.</p><p>She has the decency to blush again, and shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d My dick twitches at that answer, the image of her, swollen with my child, fills my mind. The sudden urge to breed her and make her mine drives me crazy. Everyone would know without a doubt that she belongs to me. But I think better of it and decide not to cum in her. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll fuck you, but I\u2019ll pull out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you inside me. All of you,\u201d she pleads, and I\u2019m not sure she knows what she\u2019s asking for.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d is all I say in response, because it\u2019s all I can say. If we keep talking about me cumming in her virgin pussy, this is going to be over before it starts.</p><p>I pull out a little and push back in, letting her feel how much I want it. She tilts her hips up, inviting me inside her tight body, and when I thrust hard, I feel myself hit her cervix. If I push up against that and cum, I know she\u2019ll get pregnant. Cumming right inside her would breed her instantly.</p><p>That thought makes me cum inside her a little, and I feel my seed spreading against her virgin walls, making the thought of pulling out that much harder.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her pussy clenches me so tightly, and I reach down to rub her hard clit, wanting to pull another orgasm from her body. It only takes a few strokes of my thumb and a couple of thrusts from my raw cock before her cunt is singing for me. She squeezes me harder, and I feel a flood of cunt juice run down my balls.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it. I\u2019m gonna cum.\u201d I go to pull out, but her legs lock around my ass and pull me further into her. I could probably break free if I tried, but I don\u2019t want to. I want to cum in her bare cunt. \u201cMegan, I could get you pregnant.\u201d</p><p>She moans and pushes me deeper inside her.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Shoving my face in her neck, I thrust hard, pulling her hips against me with both hands, and I feel the tip of my cock nudge her cervix again. I close my eyes and empty into her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine now,\u201d I say, feeling her nod against me.</p><p>I still can't believe that was only Saturday. She passed out before I even pulled myself from her body, so I had to carry her back to her room. I hated leaving her, but what choice did we really have? I cleaned between her legs before returning to my own room, where I stared down at the bed. Her virgin blood and my cum were mixed together on the sheet. I pulled it from the bed and folded it up, hiding it away in my dresser. What I really wanted was to hang it out the window for all the world to see. It now made sense when I heard tales of kings hanging sheets smeared with their virgin bride\u2019s blood out for all to see.</p><p>Glancing over at the clock, I see it\u2019s 1 a.m., and she\u2019s fast asleep on top of me. I came in here to talk to her, but seeing her sleeping like that got the better of me. We both have to be up early for school, and I know I need to talk to her, reassure her of what\u2019s happening here. I\u2019ve been avoiding and ignoring her as best I can.</p><p>Sunday, I spent the day with her father, but she came into the room, and I could tell she wanted to talk, so I stuck close to Phil. Once school started back on Monday, I had to pass her in the hall, and it was the worst feeling in the world. Wanting to reach out and grab her, but knowing I couldn\u2019t, and it\u2019s why I\u2019ve been staying away. Tuesday and today were the same, not being able to talk to her or touch her drove me to the edge of insanity. It\u2019s somewhat easier to show no expression, but clearly that was hard on her. I started locking my bedroom door to keep my distance, but every night I waited for her to break in. I\u2019m moving out Friday since my place is finally ready, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s probably freaking her out too.</p><p>When I heard her on the phone tonight, it got the best of me, and I needed to feel her again. Remind myself of what we have, and remind her body that I own it. I just have to figure out how we\u2019re going to do this. How we can do this without fucking up her life? I want her, and I have to have her, but I want to do it the right way. It\u2019s time we sat down and had a talk.</p><p>3</p><p>Chris</p><p>\u201cTake a lap, Anderson.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s Thursday afternoon, and we\u2019ve got our first game tomorrow against the Badgers. Their defense is going to kill us if my quarterback doesn't get the plays down.</p><p>After a hard practice, the boys are tired but ready. I think we are all feeling the adrenaline of the first game of the season and I\u2019ve got my fingers crossed. It\u2019s my first ever game as coach. I send them all to the showers as I talk to the assistant coaches, making sure everyone is ready, giving them assignments to go over tonight. This isn\u2019t just a big game for the school, it\u2019s also a big game for me too. I want to show everyone that these boys have what it takes. With this being my first coaching job, some of the media is bound to be here, and if there are scouts watching, I want these boys to have the best opportunity to show off.</p><p>When I walk through the double doors of the locker room, I head to my office, which is off to the side. I pass a row of lockers, and stop short when I hear the Megan\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cWho knew little dorky Megan would sprout up like that? Never knew a Harry Potter shirt could give me a woody. I bet that pussy of hers is cherry tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, nobody\u2019s gotten in there yet. I plan on getting it first Saturday night after the Homecoming dance. She\u2019s gonna be all mine.\u201d</p><p>It takes everything in my body not to rip apart the lockers separating me from the boys on the other side. I heard one of the juniors, Atkins, talking, but I know Croy Anderson is the one talking about fucking her. I should go over there and break it up, but my fists are clenched and I\u2019m gripping the playbook so hard I\u2019m about to rip it in half. I can\u2019t beat a student, I can\u2019t beat a student, I can\u2019t beat a student, I keep chanting in my head over and over.</p><p>\u201cI saw that hickey you left on her neck. Nice way to mark your territory, Anderson.\u201d I hear a slap on the back.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. Gotta let everybody know she\u2019s claimed property. Can\u2019t let anyone get that cherry before I do. She fucking loves it when I suck on her. She likes it everywhere, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>My eyes go blurry and I blink a few times, trying to remove the red from my vision. I\u2019ve had all I can stand, so I stomp around the lockers to the other side. When I round the corner, everyone looks at me, but my eyes are locked on Croy.</p><p>\u201cAnderson! On your feet!\u201d My voice echoes through the locker room, and he pops up off the bench looking like a scared little shit. Good. He should be scared. I want to rip his lying face off, but I control it. I can\u2019t go to jail, because then I\u2019d be without Megan, and he\u2019s not worth it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear that kind of talk in here again. Do you understand me, boy?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nods his head nervously, but I wait for a response. \u201cYes, Coach Burns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you back out on the field. You\u2019re running laps with Coach Evans, and once he feels like you\u2019re done, you\u2019re going over the playbook front to back. Then you\u2019ll come in early to go over it with him. We clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d He looks defeated as he walks past me, back out of the locker room, but I don\u2019t give a flying fuck.</p><p>I turn to the other players, and slam my playbook on the bench. \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of locker room crap your last coach put up with, but that\u2019s done and over. If I hear anything like the conversation I just heard ever again, you\u2019ll all be warming the bench come game day.\u201d They all look at me with wide eyes, but I\u2019m beyond enraged. I know it\u2019s because they were talking about Megan. This kind of talk always happens when guys get together, not just in locker rooms. But I\u2019m blinded by my anger, and I don\u2019t care. \u201cEverybody clear on this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Coach Burns,\u201d they say in unison.</p><p>I pick up my playbook and storm into my office, throwing it down on my desk. She\u2019s gotten so deep under my skin that the mention of her name is all it takes to send me over the edge. That little fucker claims he gave her that mark. That mark is mine. She\u2019s mine. I laid claim to that body first. I am the one who broke in her pussy nice and sweet. She\u2019s only had me inside of her. Not some skinny little fucker just trying to get a nut. I\u2019m working myself up, but I can\u2019t stop it. I check my watch and see that her last class is done for the day. I looked up her schedule on the school computer system, memorizing it, and I know she should be nearly home. I grab my keys off my desk, having already made up my mind.</p><p>I bust out of the locker room and out on the field, and I see Coach Evans running Anderson. I give him a chin lift as I approach, and he walks over with his arms folded. \u201cHow many does he need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough to make him remember what happened in there, but not enough that he can\u2019t play tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d Coach Evans turns back to the field and watches Anderson make a lap.</p><p>I go out to my truck and slam the door, cranking it up and hitting the gas. I\u2019ve got to get to Megan. I\u2019ve got to see her right this fucking second to calm this beast inside me.</p><p>I take the back roads to get to Phil and Janet\u2019s house, driving as fast as I can. When I pull up to the driveway, I thank God neither of them is home. They shouldn\u2019t be back for a few hours, but one can\u2019t be too careful. I jump out and pass Megan's red Honda in the garage as I jog into the house to look for her. I blow through the kitchen and living room, taking the stairs two at a time. When I get to her door, I don\u2019t bother knocking, I just push it open.</p><p>She\u2019s standing there in a loose t-shirt that reads, \u2018I run because Gandalf told me to\u2019 and baggy cut-off shorts. She has a pencil through a messy bun in her hair, and her big glasses are nearly falling off the end of her nose. She\u2019s more gorgeous every time I see her, and right now, I want nothing more than to take what someone said isn\u2019t mine.</p><p>Kicking the door shut behind me, I reach back and lock it, just in case. She slowly backs away from me, until the backs of her legs hit her bed. I stalk towards her, my steps careful. I want her to see me coming. This isn\u2019t sneaky and this isn\u2019t a surprise; I came here to take her.</p><p>\u201cChris, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat little prick Croy Anderson was spreading rumors about you two today, and I happened to overhear him.\u201d</p><p>I take another step, and she tries back away further, but she\u2019s run out of room.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d she asks, her eyes widening.</p><p>\u201cSaid he gave you that mark on your neck. Said your pussy was still cherry, and he was going to get it Saturday after the dance. Know anything about that?\u201d</p><p>She squares her shoulders and puts a hand on her hip. \u201cAre you seriously asking me that? You\u2019re the one who put the hickey on my neck for the whole damn world to see. And I\u2019m pretty sure we were both there the night we first...um...when I lost my...you know...\u201d She loses steam as she tries to say I got in that tiny cunt first.</p><p>\u201cYou mean when I got inside you first? You mean the night you came to my room, and I popped your cherry, and got your virgin blood all over my dick?\u201d</p><p>Her face turns bright red and she looks away, nodding her head.</p><p>I get in front of her and grab her chin, making her look at me. \u201cBest night of my fucking life, baby.\u201d</p><p>I lean down and take her mouth, devouring her with my kiss. I reach down, pulling at her shorts and panties, pushing them off her hips to the floor. I break the kiss long enough to take off her t-shirt and bra. Getting her naked as fast as possible is my only goal. When she\u2019s completely bare to me, I push her hips, causing her to fall back on the bed. I grab her legs and pull her to the edge, throwing her feet over my shoulders, and use my fingers to spread her pussy lips open for me. I dive in, rubbing her ripe cunt all over my face. I want her scent all over me when I fuck her, so I rub her sweet honey all over my mouth and nose. I want to be covered in her sticky sweetness so I can smell her pussy as I fuck her. I push two fingers inside her, rubbing her sweet spot as I lick and suck. She needs one quick orgasm, and then she\u2019ll be soft and ready for my dick. I want her squirting on my cock as I fuck her hard, and she needs at least one orgasm first.</p> <p>I stroke her g-spot and suck her clit as she rides my face hard. She\u2019s got my hair gripped in both her hands, humping my face like a horny slut. Knowing she\u2019s never been like this with anyone else before turns me on even more. Only I get to see her like this. I work her harder, moaning against her sweet cunt. It doesn\u2019t take long before she\u2019s cumming on my face, leaking out her sweet honey and coating my fingers. When I pull them out, I see they are covered in sticky juice, so I lean up and rub it across both her nipples. I want her titties tasting like her pussy too. She\u2019s too fucking good to only have that flavor in one spot. I wish her whole fucking body tasted like that sugary cunt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I strip quickly, keeping Megan\u2019s ass hanging off the edge of the bed. Once I\u2019m naked, I push her knees up, opening all of her to me. I line my cock up and thrust home inside her warmth. She\u2019s still virgin tight, and I keep thinking at some point she\u2019ll loosen up. But so far it\u2019s almost as if she gets tighter every time I get in her. Her cunt is primed and my strokes make loud smacking sounds. \u201cGoddamn, Megan. You\u2019re so tight and sweet. Tell me who you belong to, baby. I\u2019ve gotta cum in you again. I need you to tell me who owns this pussy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do, Coach. You own me.\u201d</p><p>I lean down, sucking a fat nipple into my mouth, tasting her cunt juice all over it. I moan around it and thrust hard, bottoming out against her cervix. I know she\u2019s still not on anything, and we are both riding bare. Her unprotected pussy is sucking up my cum, begging to be bred. The thought nearly has me going off. If I get her pregnant, there is no way she wouldn't be mine.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to breed you, don\u2019t you?\u201d The smacking sounds get louder as she gets wetter. My words are making her leak out honey down her ass and onto her bedroom floor. \u201cFuck, you just started gushing when I talked about getting you pregnant. Didn\u2019t you? Oh, you want it bad, baby, don\u2019t you? I should probably pull out, though.\u201d I grit out, gauging her reaction.</p><p>She moves her legs, locking them around my waist, and pulls me deeper inside her. I look down and she pushes her fat tits together, offering me her nipples, begging me to suck her pussy cream off them. \u201cI\u2019ve heard if I cum while you\u2019re in me, it will open up my cervix and I can take more of your cum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Her words are my undoing, and I lean down, sucking one of her nipples into my mouth, tasting her pussy on it as I thrust hard one final time. It\u2019s enough to throw her over the edge, and I feel her pussy pulsing, milking my cock and sucking my seed into her. I grab her by the waist, scooting us further onto the bed, but not breaking our connection. We don\u2019t have much time, and I want to be inside her for as long as possible.</p><p>She holds me to her chest and strokes my hair. I could sleep like this, but I try not to. I want to enjoy the few quiet moments we have together, just being us. No one else to disturb us, and no one else to worry about. I kiss her body and pet her gently. I\u2019m still hard inside her, and I move slowly, lacking the urgency I had before.</p><p>Propping up on my elbows, I look down into her clear blue eyes and brush a few blonde strands away.</p><p>\u201cWhose are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours, Chris. Always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who do I belong to?\u201d</p><p>She smiles so big both dimples show on her cheeks. \u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, baby. It\u2019s just you and me. The rest of this bullshit we can figure out. I know I\u2019ve been distant, but it\u2019s not because I didn't care. I just needed to have a plan for what we need to do. I still don\u2019t know, but staying away from you isn\u2019t the answer. We just need to be careful a little longer. I\u2019ll have my own place and it will make things easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be graduating early, so that will help too.\u201d</p><p>I nod my head, already knowing that is coming up in December. \u201cWe just need to be careful and watch our steps until then.\u201d</p><p>She nods her head in agreement, leaning up to take my lips. I kiss her back, deepening it, and thrust inside her. I want her at least once more before her parents get home.</p><p>Megan breaks the kiss and looks into my eyes, a blush creeping across her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that look for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we do it doggy-style? I hear that\u2019s an easy way to get pregnant too.\u201d</p><p>Her words have my already-hard cock getting even harder. He\u2019s twitching inside her, ready to breed my baby into her womb. I hate to leave her warmth, but I pull out and quickly turn her over, pulling her ass up in the air and pushing her head down on the pillow. \u201cHold it up like this after I cum so it slides down your cervix.\u201d</p><p>She nods into the pillow, and I push in, her pussy already coated with my seed. I fuck her hard like this, riding her cunt like a prized mare being bred. I crouch over her, getting on my feet like an animal, and rut into her hard. She moans into the pillow, loving the rough treatment, and I bite her back, leaving my mark on her. I feel her pussy start to squeeze me, and I know she\u2019s cumming. She\u2019s opening up her pussy for me, and I thrust in and hold it, filling her up.</p><p>Once we both catch our breath and come down from our peaks, I pull out and lie down beside her. I kiss her face gently and pet her body, showing her how much I care for her. She keeps her ass in the air just how I told her to, letting my cum stay and take root.</p><p>If she\u2019s not already bred, she will be soon. I\u2019ll make damn sure she\u2019s bound to me in every way possible.</p> <p>4</p><p>Chris</p><p>Sitting across the table from Megan is wonderful. Her parents being at the table with us isn\u2019t so wonderful. I reach for the bowl of salad at the same time as Megan, and our hands touch. We lock eyes and I run my fingers over hers, feeling her softness with my fingertips.</p><p>\u201cSo, Chris, your place will be ready tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Hearing my name makes Megan jump, and she pulls her hand away from mine. I look up to see Phil and Janet bringing the last of the food to the table as we all sit down for dinner. I clear my throat, trying not to think about how I was just upstairs fucking Megan\u2019s little cunt four times before they got home. It would have been five, but they came home as she was sucking my cock and getting it ready to fill her up again. I got her sweet pussy so full of cum there was hardly room to stuff my cock inside her. She kept her hips tilted up to keep as much as possible inside her, both of us hoping it would result in breeding her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, I can go pick up my keys in the morning, and everything is all set to move in on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be so excited to finally have your own space,\u201d Janet says, smiling at me.</p><p>\u201cIt will be a relief not to have to be quiet anymore.\u201d I look over and smile at Megan, letting her know full well what I mean by that.</p><p>Phil laughs and cuts up his chicken. \u201cOh, you haven\u2019t been so bad. We are all going to miss you, I know that. Aren\u2019t we, girls?\u201d</p><p>Both Megan and Janet agree, and I just smile as I eat my dinner. I know one pussy in this house is going to miss my bedtime stories, but I\u2019m thinking we\u2019ll find a way to still make that happen.</p><p>\u201cSo, honey, have you decided about college yet? I know we keep bringing it up, but you\u2019ve gotten all these acceptance letters and you\u2019re graduating in four months. You really need to decide what you want to do.\u201d</p><p>I pause, my fork halfway to my mouth, as I look at Megan for her response. I can\u2019t imagine her wanting to leave for college after what we\u2019ve shared, but if she decides to go, I guess I\u2019ll just have to follow her. It\u2019s crazy how fast your priorities can change.</p><p>She tucks her hair behind her ear and looks away from her mom and dad. \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to go. I\u2019m graduating early, but I want to leave my options open for now until I decide what I want to do.\u201d</p><p>Phil reaches over, patting her hand until she looks up at him. \u201cI completely understand, honey. I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do until I was already halfway through college and had to change majors. I wasted two years of time and money on something because my parents pushed me into it. You mom and I want you to be happy, so think about it, and when you\u2019re ready, we can decide. You\u2019re a smart girl, and we trust you\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was your age, I just wanted to have babies and be a stay-at-home mom,\u201d Janet sighs wistfully, looking over at Phil, and I nearly choke on my beer.</p><p>\u201cI wish we could have had a dozen babies, my love,\u201d Phil says, and they smile at one another. \u201cLuckily we were able to have one, and she turned out to be enough of a pain in the ass for a dozen.\u201d We all laugh, and Megan\u2019s cheeks burn with embarrassment.</p><p>Phil mentioned that Janet had to have a hysterectomy after giving birth to Megan. Something about complications with bleeding. Phil had almost lost both of them. I look at Megan and feel my heart ache. I can\u2019t imagine losing her. I know that when she gets pregnant, I\u2019ll make every doctor monitor her in case that problem should arise with her too.</p><p>Megan gives me a look, and I see it there in her eyes. Need. She wants that too. She wants to be bred. She wants to give me babies. I feel my cock swell under the table as I think about sinking inside of her again. It\u2019s been less than an hour, but I don\u2019t know how much longer I can wait.</p><p>\u201cMaybe after dinner I can show Megan where my new place is. You guys have already seen it. It\u2019s only fair she gets to see it too.\u201d</p><p>Janet beams. \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea, Chris. You being here has been so great for Megan. She\u2019s normally in her room all the time with her nose stuck in a book. You\u2019ve really opened her up.\u201d</p><p>If she only knew.</p><p>\u201cOh fuck, I\u2019m so close but we\u2019re almost there.\u201d</p><p>Megan pulls back from my cock and smiles at me from the passenger seat. \u201cYou can\u2019t come in my mouth. That would be wasteful.\u201d</p><p>She said she wanted to tease me, and did that and more. As soon as we were out of the driveway, she leaned over the gear stick and undid my pants. Thankfully, the route to my house included some back roads, so we were safe. As she sucks my cock, I reach back and put a finger in her ass. I just need to get inside every part of her. I want all her young holes stretched only for me.</p><p>I pull into my driveway and park in the garage. I look over at Megan, and put my finger in my mouth to suck it clean. Her eyes get big and her face goes bright red. \u201cThere\u2019s not a part of you that isn\u2019t sweet, baby girl.\u201d I lean in and kiss her softly on the cheek. \u201cGet out, baby.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s dark out, but we\u2019re in the garage, and I don\u2019t have any close neighbors. I get out and shut my door, going around to meet her. I grab her up and pin her to the side of the SUV. I can\u2019t wait any longer. I don\u2019t get the keys to the place until tomorrow, but I don\u2019t need to take her inside. This is going to be hard and fast, and I can do that right here.</p><p>Megan is wearing loose cut-off jean shorts and a baggy tank top that has a Stormtrooper on it and it reads, \u2018I love a man in uniform\u2019. She\u2019s so fucking cute I can\u2019t stand it. I love that she embraces what she loves, no matter what people might think. Some would see her as a nerd, but I see her as someone who loves what she loves, not caring what people think.</p><p>I have her pinned to the side of my car, my face in her neck as I bite and suck, leaving another mark for that Croy motherfucker to see. He can tell anybody he wants he did it, but that little shit knows good and well she\u2019s claimed. Someone else is getting her sweet cunt, not him. Not ever.</p> <p>I pull back and spin her around. \u201cPut your hands on the hood, baby. I need to get off. You got me so worked up with that sweet mouth of yours, it\u2019s gonna take me two seconds to nut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust cum inside me, Chris. I don\u2019t need to get off, but just make sure you get it all in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ll get off.\u201d</p><p>I push her shorts down to her knees, and lift the back of her tank so I can see all of her ass. I unbutton my jeans and pull out my cock, already leaking and ready. She leans forward over the hood and sticks her ass out for me. I lube my cock at her opening, seeing that she\u2019s soaked and ready too. Her horny cunt sucks me in slick and easy, without any resistance. I grab her hips with both hands and start to fuck her hard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I won\u2019t last long like this, but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ll make sure she gets off after, but right now I\u2019ve got to fill her little pussy up. My balls are tight and achy. It\u2019s like I haven\u2019t gotten off inside her four times already today. The animal inside me needs her. I look down at where we are connected, seeing my dick pull out of her tight cunt covered in her cream. She\u2019s so wet for it, I\u2019ve got a ring around the base of my cock from her juices, and it drips down my nuts. Sticky syrupy sounds echo in the empty garage as my wet balls smack against her pussy.</p><p>Once again she\u2019s my prime breeding machine, taking my big cock all the way inside and begging for more. Her fertile cunt opens for seed, my seed. Seeing my cock disappear inside of her and feeling her tight pussy squeezing it to the point of pain are enough. I thrust hard one last time, pumping all of my cum into her. She squeezes me and sucks me dry. When my last drop escapes, I pull out and spin her around as I go down on my knees in front of her.</p><p>Megan\u2019s shorts and panties are still around her knees, but I don\u2019t need much room. I\u2019m at eye level with her pussy, and I bury my face in the softness there. She can\u2019t spread her legs because her clothes restrict her movement, but I grab her hips, pulling her to me to get my tongue on her clit. I lick her all over as her hands go to my hair and her moans fill the garage. I suck her clit into my mouth, biting on it slightly and making her shout. She tastes like the two of us mixed together, and I fucking love it. Sucking her cream-covered clit and hearing her sounds have my cock leaking all over again\u2014a fresh batch of cum ready for her.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take long before she\u2019s tensing up and throwing her head back, lost in pleasure. Her orgasm causes a flood of juice to flow between her thighs, and I feel it dripping down my chin. I pull back and see a big smile on her face as she catches her breath. I smile back at her, but flip her around again, pulling her ass towards me as her hands grab the hood.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Chris. Again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one more, baby, and I swear I\u2019ll be done.\u201d We both know that\u2019s a lie, because she can\u2019t go to sleep without my cock inside her.</p><p>I fuck her on the hood of the SUV, fighting between my instinct to be gentle and the urge to wear her pussy out so much that she won\u2019t be able to walk tomorrow. She\u2019ll be sore sitting down as it is, so I\u2019m trying not to break her cunt. I grab her ass with both hands, pulling it to me as I fuck into her tightness. She bounces against my cock, and the feeling of her welcoming softness against my hardness is so fucking perfect.</p><p>The need to cum is so strong I feel like a goddamn teenager with his first dirty magazine. But it only takes me a few minutes until I\u2019m pouring into her cunt again.</p><p>When I pull out, my cock is a sticky mess. Between her cum and mine, I\u2019m covered, but I don\u2019t give a fuck, and I tuck it back into my jeans, smearing our juices all over my underwear.</p><p>I help Megan pull her panties and shorts back up, since her legs are so shaky. Once I straighten her out, I kiss her on the nose and then on the lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think about the new place?\u201d</p><p>She lets out the cutest snort and then makes an exaggerated motion of looking around the garage. \u201cI love it.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t take my eyes off her when I whisper, \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>5</p><p>Megan</p><p>Pulling on the door, I come up short when I see the sign: \u2018Library closed for Homecoming dance committee meeting until end of the school day. Study hall open in room 213\u2019. Crap. I don\u2019t know why I elected to come my senior year. I could\u2019ve graduated at the end of my junior year, but my mom reminded me of all the things I would miss: school dances, graduation, and all the great things normal teenagers apparently do their senior year.</p><p>I\u2019m not normal, but I know part of my mom isn\u2019t ready for me to leave home yet. I am still her baby on some level. She always wanted a big family, and with the way things are going, that might be happening rather soon. Making my way back down the hall, I head to room 213. I\u2019m only enrolled in two classes this semester, and neither of them are credits I need or care about. Opening the door to study hall, I stop when I see six sets of eyes turn and look at me.</p><p>A blush hits my cheeks when their gazes linger over me, and I see Croy among the students. He gives me a cocky chin lift. It takes everything in me not to roll my eyes. I can\u2019t believe he was telling people he gave me that hickey. I\u2019ve only been back at school a week, and it seems things have changed. If I walked into this room last year, none of them would\u2019ve turned to look my way. Now six of the school\u2019s football players are staring at me like I\u2019m the \u2018precious\u2019 from The Lord of The Rings.</p><p>\u201cMegan?\u201d</p><p>My heartbeat accelerates when I hear my name. I know that voice all too well. I look over to see Chris sitting at the front of the classroom, but my eyes shoot over to Miss Heart, who\u2019s sitting on the corner of his desk. She\u2019s smiling at my Chris, being extra flirty, and it makes me clench my teeth.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Coach Burns, the library...\u201d My words trail off when I realize everyone is still staring at me. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m used to or really care for. I prefer to blend in with the crowd and keep to myself. Even more so in high school.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come to the front of the room and have a seat?\u201d He says it without having to hear the end of my sentence. He glances over to the back of the room where Croy and some of his teammates are sitting, and then back to me. His eyes are hard, and it doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to get his silent message: Don\u2019t fucking sit by them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I debate it for half a second before I change my mind. Though I love when I get Chris worked up and crazy, and Croy seems to be his hot button, I opt not to. Tonight\u2019s the first game of the season, and he doesn\u2019t need me adding to his stress. No matter how much I want to go over there in protest of Miss Heart sitting on his desk, I refrain. Isn\u2019t there a freaking thirty-year-old history book she should be updating or something?</p><p>Making my way to the front of the classroom, I sit in the chair directly in front of them, dropping my bag on the floor next to me. Now I\u2019ll be able to hear everything they say. Miss Heart shoots me an annoyed look, like she notices this as well, but she quickly covers it up. She leans down close to Chris, and it\u2019s then I realize my mistake. Now she\u2019ll just have to lean in close to him to whisper.</p><p>I can\u2019t do anything but stare at her. The famous Miss Heart. And by \u2018famous\u2019, I mean all the boys have talked about her since I can remember. She teaches ninth grade history and runs the cheerleading squad for the varsity football team. Today is game day, so the cheerleaders wear their uniforms, the players all sport their jerseys, and all the teachers and students dress in \u2018spirit\u2019 gear, something I\u2019ve never participated in. I\u2019ve never even gone to one of the games. Living in Texas, people worship high school football; something I still don\u2019t understand.</p><p>Like everyone else Miss Heart is all dressed up for game day. She has her dark hair in a high ponytail with blue and white ribbons. Her jeans fit her almost like a second skin, and I wonder how she breathes in them. Her school shirt has a deep V down in the front, and the further she leans down towards Chris, the more her boobs show.</p> <p>I look over at him and see his eyes are locked on me, not paying any attention to Miss Heart.</p><p>\u201cChris,\u201d she says louder, making him look back at her. I bite the inside of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cWe could really use your help on Saturday. Afterwards everyone is going out, and you\u2019re more than welcome to join us. You can meet the rest of the staff. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be celebrating your win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can, Kim. I\u2019m moving this weekend.\u201d His voice is dismissive, and it warms my belly. Normally, girls like her get all the guys, but for some reason Chris wants me. It\u2019s attention I\u2019ve never gotten from the opposite sex before. Well, not until recently. But to be honest, I hadn't wanted it until him. Chris is different. I knew it from the moment I ran right into him. My mom always told me when I found the one, I\u2019d know it, and she was right. Seeing him and feeling him for the first time, it was like my body came alive. And like most things I\u2019ve wanted in life, I just went for it. When I decide on something, it\u2019s final and there\u2019s no holding me back. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing with Chris, but sometimes I think I bit off more than I can chew. I know this could end badly, and that maybe our timing is wrong, but I also know that it would take something like this, something hard and fast and consuming, to change me.</p><p>\u201cHow about you come Saturday night, and I\u2019ll come over Sunday and help you.\u201d She leans in closer to Chris, and I hear her say in a hushed tone, \u201cOr I could just stay over Saturday night, and I\u2019ll be there in the morning to help you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMegan.\u201d I jump when Croy says my name and it pulls me away from hearing Chris\u2019 answer to Miss Heart\u2019s innuendo. I don\u2019t turn around to look at Croy, because I know he\u2019s taken the seat behind me. I can feel him leaning up closer to me, and I want to cringe.</p><p>\u201cYes, Croy,\u201d I say, pulling out my notebook from my bag, trying not to stare at Miss Heart and Chris. I don\u2019t want to watch her flirt with him, and I know there\u2019s nothing I can do about it.</p><p>\u201cYou change your mind and decide you want to come to the dance with me? Broke my heart when you cancelled.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s hard to contain the snort I want to release. First off, it wasn't me who cancelled the date, it was Chris. He took my phone and texted Croy. I\u2019m not even sure what he said because he deleted the text and blocked his number. I don\u2019t know what Croy\u2019s deal is. We\u2019ve gone to school together since middle school, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever talked to me in my life until this year. It\u2019s got to be these boobs. I glance down at my shirt and see my boobs straining against it. I really need to get some bigger sizes. I had no idea this was going to happen over the summer. This has to be more then late blossoming.</p><p>\u201cHmm...\u201d I struggle to find the words. I\u2019ve not been big on talking to boys. Chris is the exception, but he\u2019s definitely no boy.</p><p>I feel Croy pull one of the pencils out of my hair, making my locks fall, hitting my shoulders. I\u2019m annoyed, and I start to say something, but luckily I\u2019m saved from having to answer him.</p> <p>\u201cAnderson, why don\u2019t you go to my office and watch those game tapes? I\u2019ve got them sitting on my desk.\u201d</p><p>I look up to see Chris glaring over at us. Why is he angry? It\u2019s not like I can control where Croy chooses to sit. It\u2019s freaking study hall. Seniors come and go as they please. But I love that he\u2019s feeling a spark of the jealousy that I\u2019m feeling right now.</p><p>Getting up from his seat, Croy tugs on a piece of my hair, making me look up at him. \u201cYou coming tonight?\u201d he asks, and I know he\u2019s talking about the game.</p><p>I just nod my head.</p><p>\u201cWait for me after and we\u2019ll talk.\u201d He pauses for a second, and then leans down so he can look me in my eyes. \u201cSince you won\u2019t respond to my texts.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m terrible about charging my phone.\u201d It\u2019s not a total lie. I\u2019m the worst with that thing.</p><p>\u201cCroy!\u201d Chris snaps again, making both of us jump. Even Miss Heart backs off his desk.</p><p>Croy throws his hands up in an apologetic gesture, but he looks back at me, and then at Chris, before he shakes his head and leaves.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Why doesn't everyone head out.\u201d I glance up at the clock on the wall and see school isn't out for another fifteen minutes, but everyone hops to, excited about the early dismissal. Miss Heart continues to stand there, so I grab my bag, hating that I\u2019m going to have to leave them both in here alone.</p><p>\u201cMegan, I need to speak with you. Your father asked me to give you a message.\u201d I can tell from his tone that he\u2019s pissed, and for some reason it makes my nipples hard. Hearing the authority in his voice does something to my body I didn\u2019t expect. After the Croy incident yesterday, he fucked me until I could barely move. Everything between my legs has been so sore today, but just his tone makes me wet with need.</p><p>Miss Heart stands there like she\u2019s waiting to hear the message herself. I bet she\u2019s hoping he gives me the message and then I\u2019ll leave, giving her the alone time I can see she\u2019s chomping at the bit to get. But I have a feeling Chris is going to give me more than a message.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done here, Kim.\u201d His words are final and dismissive, and I almost feel bad for her. Almost.</p><p>She lets out an irritated breath, and I can tell she wants to say something, but she won\u2019t because I\u2019m standing there. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll see you on the sidelines tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your cheerleaders away from my players, or they\u2019ll be cheering from the stands.\u201d</p><p>My eyes bulge at his words, and I wonder what she\u2019ll say, but she just clenches her jaw and slams the door behind her. Chris follows after her, and I wonder what he\u2019s going to do, but when he reaches the door he locks it. He pulls down the window shade, and then turns to look at me.</p><p>My whole body starts to buzz as I feel his eyes on me. If I didn't know him I\u2019d probably be scared. Chris isn\u2019t a small man by any means. He\u2019s well over a foot taller than me, my head just coming up to his chest. It\u2019s clear he still maintains the build he had when he played in the NFL, because there isn't a soft spot on him. He\u2019s muscled everywhere, and sometimes when he takes me, I feel completely caged under him. Right now, his dark brown eyes seem black, and I see him take a slow deep breath, release it, and squeeze his fists at his side.</p><p>\u201cBend over the desk.\u201d His words come out as a growl, and I hardly recognize it. Nodding, I head towards the desk he was just sitting at, and do what he says.</p><p>Dropping my bag back on the floor, I get to his desk and bend over. Once I\u2019m in position I wait. I stay there for a few minutes and nothing happens, but I know not to move.</p><p>\u201cChris?\u201d I ask, the silence killing me.</p><p>\u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t understand what he means, but now I can feel him behind me. I can feel the soft touch of his pants against my legs.</p><p>\u201cSay my name again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris.\u201d</p><p>As soon as his name passes my lips, he flips up my skirt. He told me to wear one this morning after he fucked me against my bathroom door. He had to rip my pants down my legs, and afterwards he told me, \u201cEnough with the pants shit.\u201d He said he needed easy access to me, so I dug through my drawers to find this skirt.</p><p>In a flash, my panties are down my thighs, but he doesn't pull them off. He uses his feet to kick mine further apart, stretching the white material of my panties. It makes the cotton bite into my thighs, and the feeling puts me on edge. I hear the sounds of his belt buckle coming undone, and then his zipper going down. My pussy knows what\u2019s coming, and my clit starts to pulse.</p><p>\u201cThis is going to be quick. I need this to calm me down before I can let you leave this room. I know I won\u2019t get to see you until tonight.\u201d I can hear the pleading tone in his voice, so I push my ass back further, letting him know I want this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours. Do whatever you like with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d He thrusts all the way in, and his long thick cock fills me so I\u2019m just at the threshold of pain. I\u2019m so much smaller than him, and his cock is so big, but I\u2019m starting to stretch for him. I want to take everything he gives me, and feeling him inside me is beyond heaven. My pussy clenches all around him, loving the feel of him inside me. I wish we could stay joined like this all the time.</p> <p>Gripping the desk on either side of me, he starts to pump in and out. His hands land next to mine, gripping the desk with me, his knuckles turning white. We both hold on as he fucks me hard, filling every inch of me with his enormous dick. There\u2019s not a centimeter left inside of me that he hasn\u2019t filled, and being stretched and pounded like this turns me on even more.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand it when any of them talk to you. It\u2019s fucking ridiculous, but I don\u2019t care.\u201d He starts pumping fast, his words pushing me to my own orgasm. I have no idea why his jealousy turns me on, but it does. To think this man is so crazy for me, that I drive him to the brink and make him lose control, gives me so much power. I love that he\u2019s so far gone with me that he\u2019s beyond reason.</p><p>\u201cBeg me.\u201d He\u2019s grunting against me as he starts to fuck me faster. I can tell by the grit of his teeth he\u2019s doing everything he can to be quiet.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Chris, fill me with your cum. I want it so bad.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShow me, Megan. Milk it out of me.\u201d</p><p>He releases his grip on the desk and reaches down to my clit. That\u2019s all it takes, just the slightest touch, and I start to cum. I feel my pussy gripping him as he pounds into me from behind. The desk scoots across the floor from the force of his thrusts, and I\u2019m cumming hard. I\u2019m doing just as he asked and milking his cock. I feel his warm release splash into my body as he drops down onto my back, kissing my neck. His final twitches inside me are a sweet feeling as he whispers against my skin.</p><p>\u201cThank you, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I should be thanking you.\u201d</p><p>I let out a giggle, and he leans back, pulling out of me. I feel him drop down, and he\u2019s between my legs, pulling my panties the rest of the way down.</p><p>\u201cLove the skirt. Step out.\u201d He indicates for me to lift my foot so he can pull them all the way off. \u201cDon\u2019t move, let me clean you.\u201d</p><p>Using my panties, he wipes between my legs while I watch him over my shoulder. I wait for him to tell me to step back into them, but when he doesn\u2019t, I turn around and watch him put them in his pocket</p><p>\u201cFor luck tonight.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, and I feel myself blush. How I could possibly still have anything left to blush about, I don\u2019t know. Chris stands up, fixes his pants, and then he straightens my skirt.</p><p>\u201cStay away from him, Megan.\u201d I don\u2019t have to ask who he\u2019s talking about.</p><p>\u201cStay away from her!\u201d It\u2019s a bratty comeback but I don\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>He legitimately looks confused, and it just adds to my irritation.</p><p>\u201cMiss Big Boobs, Kim Heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has tits?\u201d</p><p>I hate it, but his comment makes me smile, and then it turns into a laugh. He comes over to me, wrapping me up in a hug, and I nuzzle into him, wishing we could get out of here.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you pretend to be with someone else just because we can\u2019t be together yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow go home and get ready for the game tonight. I need to see you in the stands, cheering me on.\u201d</p><p>I nod my head, and he leans down to kiss me. Feeling his warm lips against mine has me ready for more, but we don\u2019t have time, and this isn\u2019t exactly the best location. I\u2019ll just have to do what we\u2019ve been doing. Wait.</p><p>6</p><p>Chris</p><p>We took down the Badgers in a blowout. I was nervous about it all coming together, but thankfully it turned out all right. The boys performed better than I expected, and I was right to push them so hard. There were scouts in the stands after the media came to film my first game. I even saw a few of my old coaches walking around and taking notes.</p> <p>It takes a couple of hours after the game to talk to everyone and have the locker room speech with the players. Afterwards I have to do some handshakes with the news and a few boosters to talk about the upcoming season. Overall, it\u2019s a lot more politics than I bargained for, but it is what it is. I guess if I want to continue to coach, this side is the bullshit I have to deal with.</p><p>The worst part about tonight was having to do an interview and having to watch helplessly as Croy went up to Megan after the game and put his hands on her. I had a news camera and a microphone in my face, so I kept it together. He reached out to touch her, but she just stood there with her arms crossed. Her big tits were perched on top of her folded arms, making them look obscene, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s why Croy was hanging around.</p><p>Phil and Janet were close by, and they looked like they were having a chummy conversation with him too. That fucking kid makes my blood boil, and I\u2019m pissed off that there isn\u2019t shit I can do about it while I\u2019m his coach.</p><p>I made it through the interview without incident, and as I walked past them to the locker room, Megan and I locked eyes. Her parents were so wrapped up in their conversation with Croy they didn\u2019t see me signal to Megan to check her phone.</p><p>When I get to my office, I grab my phone and text her.</p><p>ME: TELL YOUR PARENTS YOU\u2019RE STAYING WITH A FRIEND TONIGHT.</p><p>MEGAN: WHAT FRIEND?</p><p>ME: DOESN\u2019T MATTER. TELL THEM I\u2019LL GIVE YOU A RIDE SINCE IT\u2019S NEAR MY HOUSE. I\u2019LL DROP YOU OFF TOMORROW TOO BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO BACK AND GET MY STUFF.</p><p>MEGAN: SO YOU AND ME ALL ALONE TONIGHT?</p><p>ME: IF YOU TELL THAT FUCKER TO KEEP HIS HANDS OFF YOU.</p><p>MEGAN: MEET YOU AT YOUR CAR XOXO &lt;3</p><p>I toss my phone in my bag and head out. I\u2019m irritated, even though this should be a great night. Maybe it\u2019s just different being on this side of things. When I was a player, the celebration started after the game, but it seems like I can\u2019t get away from people wanting to do interviews and parents wanting to ask about playing time. All I want to do is get Megan and go home so I can sink inside her in peace.</p><p>I got the keys for my new place from the builder this morning, but Megan still hasn\u2019t seen the inside. I plan on showing her every square foot after I get her out of here. The thought causes me to smile, and as I\u2019m not paying attention, I almost run right into Kim.</p><p>\u201cHey, Coach Burns. Great win out there tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I start to sidestep her, but she follows me.</p><p>\u201cListen, I know you said you\u2019ve got to move tomorrow, but what about a celebratory drink tonight? I promise I know how to show you a good time, you know, you being new in town and all.\u201d</p><p>I look over her shoulder and see Megan standing there with her family and Croy. She\u2019s pissed, and I am too. We\u2019ve got to get away from all this shit. \u201cKim, I appreciate the offer, but I\u2019m not interested. I have a standing policy to never date coworkers, and I\u2019m sorry if I gave you any impression otherwise.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her cheeks flush and she looks away. \u201cI...I just meant as friends.\u201d She\u2019s backpedaling and we both know it. \u201cYou may be some big shot NFL player, but that doesn\u2019t give you the right to be an asshole.\u201d She spins around and stomps away like I was somehow rude to her.</p><p>I just shake my head and try to pretend that didn\u2019t just happen. I go over to everyone waiting for me. I speak to Croy first. He\u2019s my biggest problem, and I need to get rid of him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Chris, congratulations on the win!\u201d Janet beats me to the punch and gives me a hug. I can\u2019t help but smile. She would have made a great cheerleader. She\u2019s beaming with pride.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you did an outstanding job of coaching our star quarterback as well.\u201d Phil pats Croy on the back, and I try not to roll my eyes. He fucked up no less than a dozen plays tonight, but luckily my o-line is strong and saved the day.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d is all I can manage to say as Croy beams, clearly taking the credit. It\u2019s a big win for him, and I don\u2019t want to cheat him out of it. But that kid needs some work if he wants to play college ball.</p><p>\u201cSo, Megan said you\u2019re going to be able to give her a ride tonight.\u201d</p><p>I nearly choke on my own spit at Janet\u2019s question, but I just nod and smile.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Mom. Coach said it was on the way to his new place, and then he could just bring me back in the morning when he comes to get the last of his stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, sounds perfect, as long as he doesn\u2019t mind. Your car is still in the shop getting new tires.\u201d Janet looks at her phone distractedly. \u201cYou\u2019ll just need to be back before noon so you can get your hair done for the dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going?\u201d The words come out as an accusation. Croy answers, which just pisses me off further.</p><p>\u201cYes, we finally worked out the details. I\u2019m going to meet up with some of the guys tonight.\u201d He turns, looking at Megan expectantly, and she just nods her head at him. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll pick you up at five tomorrow. We can do dinner before.\u201d</p><p>Megan\u2019s eyes go wide, but she doesn\u2019t respond. Phil turns to Croy and shakes his hand, telling him he did a good job tonight. I give him a chin lift, and he heads out, leaving the four of us.</p><p>\u201cAll right, husband, we\u2019re kid-free tonight. Let\u2019s go get wild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean ice cream, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>After Phil and Janet leave, I walk to my car, Megan trailing behind me. I hear her quick footsteps trying to keep up, and it\u2019s all I can do not to turn around and throw her over my shoulder. I\u2019m aggravated, pissed off, and horny. Not a good combination.</p><p>I climb in the SUV and wait for Megan to get in and close the door. I crank it up and pull out of the parking lot, waving to people as we leave. Once we are away from school and on the road, I grip the steering wheel with both hands.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going with Croy? After I just said you needed to stay away from him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe put me on the spot in front of my parents. What was I supposed to say? \u2018Sorry I have a boyfriend, and oh look, here he comes now. You guys might recognize him.\u2019 No. My mom jumped at the chance for me to go to a dance. She wanted me to experience the last part of my high school years, and I guess that included Homecoming. You act like I had a choice.\u201d</p><p>I know she\u2019s right, but I can\u2019t think clearly when it comes to her. \u201cFuck.\u201d It\u2019s the only thing I can say. I feel like an asshole for putting us both in this position, but we\u2019re stuck, and I can\u2019t claim her out in the open. Yet.</p><p>\u201cShow me your pussy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me, Megan. Pull your skirt up and show me your cunt. Let me see what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p> <p>I see her shaky fingers go her hem as she scoots her ass to the end of the seat. She pulls it up, spreading her legs wide. I can\u2019t help myself. I reach over.</p><p>\u201cSpread your lips for me.\u201d</p><p>When she does, I rub two fingers over her wet clit, and then sink them deep inside her. I finger-fuck her for a few minutes, and then pull them out, licking them clean. Fuck, I love the taste of her teenage cunt.</p><p>\u201cLet me see your tits too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris.\u201d She sounds shy, but I need it.</p><p>\u201cShow me, Megan. Now.\u201d</p><p>She lifts her shirt and pulls down the soft cups of her bra, letting her big tits bounce free. I reach over, pinching one hard nipple, and then the other. I want my mouth on them so bad, but I\u2019ll have to wait a little longer.</p><p>I reach down and undo my khakis, pulling my cock out. \u201cCome suck me off before we get home. I want you too much right now, and I won\u2019t last.\u201d</p><p>She crawls over to me, leaning over the center console, and starts sucking me right away. Feeling her hot little mouth on my dick is heaven. She\u2019d never sucked a dick before mine, and fuck if that doesn\u2019t make me love it more. She said she watched instructional videos on it, wanting to make it good for me. It\u2019s working all right, because she gives the best head I\u2019ve ever had. She reaches down, stroking my shaft down to my balls and teasing back up as she twirls her tongue around the head. Her warm wet mouth sucks and licks, begging for my cum. I pull over on a back road and grab her hair with both hands, pulling it back out of the way for her while she gets me off.</p><p>I cum hard and fast, and goddamn, her sweet little mouth sucks it all down. \u201cOh God, baby. The best. Best.\u201d</p><p>I breathe heavily as she sits back against the passenger door, spreading her legs wide for me. Seeing her glistening pussy and how she got off on sucking me makes me start leaking cum all over again. I\u2019ll never get enough of her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want you to rub your pussy until we get there.\u201d</p><p>I put the car in gear and pull back onto the road. I glance over every few seconds, seeing her rub her pussy and hearing her sticky sounds of pleasure. The SUV smells like her cunt, and I wish it smelled like this all the time. I'm tempted to tell her to rub it all over the car, but we\u2019re pulling into the garage and I don\u2019t want to waste any time.</p><p>Once the garage door closes, I get out and Megan follows. Before she can open the door between the garage and the house, I scoop her up and carry her across the threshold.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she laughs, but I don\u2019t answer. I just smile and keep walking.</p><p>I carry her down the long hall and straight to the master suite. I bypass the mattress that\u2019s sitting on the floor, and go to the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cI need a shower after that game, and I want you to help me break it in.\u201d</p><p>I had some furniture delivered this afternoon. Basic essentials I knew I would need for my first night. The bulk of the furniture and all my boxes from storage will come tomorrow.</p><p>Walking over, I set Megan on the bathroom counter between the double sinks. \u201cYours is on the left,\u201d I say, kissing her nose and moving to turn on the shower.</p><p>\u201cI have a sink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have more than that.\u201d I toss over my shoulder, letting her think what she wants to.</p><p>Once the eight shower heads are running hot, I turn and strip, and then do the same for Megan. I pick her up and she wraps her legs around me as I carry us both to the shower. My cock is hard and jutting up between us. I\u2019m leaking cum, and it rubs between us, making me even harder.</p><p>I had the builders put in a high seat in the shower, big enough for me to sit on. As it turns out, it\u2019s also the perfect height for me to sit Megan on while I wash her, and when I fuck her.</p><p>After I set Megan down, I hit the built-in shampoo dispenser the designers put in. I make her lean back as I lather her hair, massaging as I go. She moans with pleasure, and that\u2019s when I move between her legs, pressing my cock to her opening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck every inch of you. In every inch of this house. Starting right now.\u201d</p><p>She reaches between us and grabs my cock, guiding me in while I continue to shampoo her hair. I fuck her slowly, unhurriedly, because we\u2019ve got all night. I\u2019ve already taken the edge off, but I know she needs to come after our playtime in the car.</p><p>\u201cReach down and rub your clit, baby. Use my dick to get off.\u201d</p><p>She does as I ask, rubbing her clit while I fuck her. The only point of contact between us is my hands in her hair, and my cock in her pussy. She moans and grinds against me, taking her pleasure.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, baby. Be as loud as you want. This is our home, and you can scream the fucking roof down.\u201d</p><p>Megan moans louder, letting it echo off the shower walls. Fuck if her sounds don\u2019t make me want to cum. I feel her pussy start to squeeze me, and her back arches away from the tile. She rubs hard and fast, and I watch as her orgasm hits her. She\u2019s beautiful when she cums, and being able to just watch is fucking amazing. Seeing her lost in her pleasure triggers my own release, and I thrust against her, holding my cock inside as far as I can go, emptying all of my seed inside her.</p><p>When I catch my breath, I don\u2019t pull out. I just pick her up and tilt her head towards the shower head to rinse her off. Afterwards, I move her back to the seat and soap us both up, still not breaking our connection. I want to be inside her as much as possible tonight. My goal is to not pull out one time. Just one continual fuck fest.</p><p>I kiss her sweet lips and lick water droplets off her nipples as we rinse off. It sparks off our need all over again, so when I step out of the shower, I just take her down to the tile floor. The cool marble chills our hot skin and creates a slick surface for me to fuck her on.</p><p>\u201cYou should really get a rug in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou pick it out, I\u2019ll buy it,\u201d I say, licking the water drops off her neck.</p> <p>\u201cI think a Star Wars-themed bathroom would be pretty badass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want, love.\u201d</p><p>7</p><p>Megan</p><p>\u201cYou're not going,\u201d he whispers in my ear before he nuzzles my neck, the morning light shining through the windows, giving it a little nip.</p><p>\u201cChris, my mom...\u201d I try to reason with him, but my words cut off as he pulls himself from me. I instantly miss the warmth of his body.</p><p>The bedroom is bare, with only a king-size mattress on the floor. Chris paces the room like a caged lion wanting out. The tense lines of all his muscles show. Okay, maybe not a tiger, more like a bear.</p><p>\u201cCome back to bed.\u201d Sitting up, I let the sheet drop away, hoping it will entice him back into bed. I don't know how much longer I have until the movers show up, and I want to soak up every minute of alone time we can have together. These moments are rare, and I want every second I can get. A moment without having to worry about being caught, or what people will think. It\u2019s just him and me in our safe bubble.</p><p>\"Fuck!\" he bellows, and then turns to look at me. His curse sounds angry, but his face doesn't show any trace of that. \u201cI can't do this.\u201d</p><p>A sudden panic hits me at his words, and I can feel the blood leave my face. Gripping the sheet, I pull it to cover myself.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no, baby.\u201d He's on me instantly, his big hands cupping my face. \u201cI meant this hiding shit. I can't do it, and it\u2019s driving me fucking crazy. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me, but the thought of you going anywhere with that kid drives me nuts. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d make it through the night without losing it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Chris, I would never do anything with him.\" I try to reassure him about the dance, running my hand up and down his back and pulling him closer. He just stares down at me. His face looks like he's in agony.</p><p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t because I won\u2019t let you near him.\u201d His mouth takes mine in a punishing kiss. It\u2019s hard, and it demands my surrender\u2014something he already has. I can feel his need to mark me, and I should probably be scared by his intensity, but I\u2019m not. I crave it, want it more than anything else in the whole world.</p><p>No one has ever made me feel the way he does. Like he can\u2019t breathe without me. \u201cI need you.\u201d My legs drop open a little more at his words, giving him what he wants, letting him fully slide between them. His big body cages mine. He feels so good pressed against me. My heart pounds and desire rushes through me.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t wait for permission, no build up or foreplay. He pushes inside my body with all the strength in his powerful thighs. His cock thrusts against the tight muscles of my pussy, and I feel a delicious ache as he bumps against my cervix.</p><p>\u201cYou feel that? I\u2019m going to drain every drop of me into you, and your greedy pussy is going to soak it all up. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I moan at his words; it\u2019s all I can get out as my pussy clenches around him, begging him to do it. My body jerks beneath him as he starts to thrust in and out of me. Each thrust is more forceful than the last. Using his hand, he holds me in place, thrusting deeper, like he can\u2019t get far enough inside me.</p><p>Our moans fill the room as he begins to pound into me at a punishing pace. I know I\u2019ll feel the aftermath of this love-making for days to come. Waves of pleasure so intense wash over me, I\u2019m not sure how much I can take. He rides me hard, making me scream out his name. The climax strikes me without warning, ripping through my body like an explosion. My body locks up under his, every muscle tensing as the orgasm courses through me.</p><p>His cum shoots into my body, his warm jets filling me up. My pussy clamps down around him, trying to greedily suck up all of his cum.</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck is she?\u201d The shrill words jolt me from my lust-sodden mind, Chris\u2019s body goes rigid against me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here?\u201d he bellows, getting up.</p><p>The woman standing in the door looks completely unfazed by Chris\u2019s hard words. She\u2019s well put-together, her short red hair falling to her shoulders. It\u2019s completely straight, with not a strand out of place. Her dark lipstick is a dramatic contrast to her pale skin. She looks like she\u2019s at least six feet tall, with killer heels helping her get there.</p><p>She stares at me with her nose scrunched in disgust, like I\u2019m some kind of bug. It\u2019s then I realize I\u2019m completely naked and so is Chris, standing there next to the bed in all his glory.</p><p>\u201cTurn around, don\u2019t look at her naked,\u201d he barks out, but the woman just stands there staring at me. If anyone should get dressed, it\u2019s him.</p><p>\u201cMegan, bathroom. Now,\u201d he says, noticing the woman in the doorway isn\u2019t moving. \u201cMegan!\u201d he snaps again, sending me into motion and scrambling for the bathroom. I see Chris sliding on a pair of boxers as I slam the bathroom door, and I\u2019m somewhat relieved.</p><p>Dressing quickly, I\u2019m thankful that my clothes are in here as I listen to the yelling on the other side of the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, and how the fuck did you even get in, Delilah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Chris, I shouldn\u2019t have responded like that, I know we aren\u2019t exclusive.\u201d</p><p>The word \u2018exclusive\u2019 makes my stomach clench.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d Chris\u2019s words are sharp and angry. I\u2019ve never heard him talk like this.</p><p>\u201cWell, I just thought, you know, we could never be together before because you traveled so much, and now, well, you\u2019re here, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo down to the kitchen and wait for me,\u201d I hear Chris say, making a lump form in my throat. Why isn\u2019t he kicking her out? Are they still in some kind of relationship?</p><p>It makes me wonder if how he acts with me during sex is how he acts with every woman. I\u2019m new to this. Maybe he\u2019s just always this intense. Maybe he likes talking dirty, and I\u2019m just one in a long line of many.</p><p>I jump when I see the door handle wiggle. \u201cMegan, unlock the door.\u201d</p> <p>I wipe the tears from my eyes, not sure what to say. I don\u2019t want him to know I\u2019m crying.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be out in a minute. I\u2019m just going to jump in the shower...\u201d I pause for a second to steady my voice so it won\u2019t crack. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go take care of your\u2014\u201d I stop because I don\u2019t know what to call her.</p><p>\u201cAll right, baby. Don\u2019t leave this room, you hear me?\u201d His voice is stern and not to be questioned.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d is all I can manage, thankful the one word is all I need. A minute later I hear his footsteps leave the room. Releasing a breath I didn\u2019t realize I was holding, I seize the opportunity. Slipping from the bathroom, I peek out the window that overlooks the front yard.</p><p>Shit. We\u2019re in the middle of nowhere. No way could I walk. I see Chris\u2019s pants on the floor so I go over and pull out his keys.</p><p>Now I just have to get out of here without being noticed. As I sneak down the stairs, I pause when I hear the woman say, \u201cWe were going to get married. You said you wanted babies, and I\u2019m ready for that.\u201d</p><p>It takes everything in me to hold back the sob that wants to escape. I feel like I\u2019m about to vomit. I can\u2019t listen to any more of this. I sneak around to the garage, and it\u2019s then I see how the woman got inside. Chris had left the garage door open. Sliding into his SUV, I text my mom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Megan: Pick me up at the school</p><p>Mom: Be there in ten</p><p>I start the car and pull out of the driveway. I have to beat my mom to the school. I don\u2019t want her to see me driving Chris\u2019s car.</p><p>When I get there, I pull the car into the backlot, dropping the keys into the side panel of the door. Pulling my phone from my purse, I see a ton of missed calls and texts from Chris. Without reading them I type out a message as I head to the front of the school to wait for my mom.</p> <p>Megan: Sorry I took your car but I left it at the school in the staff parking lot. Keys are in the side door. I need time to think. Please give it to me.</p><p>When my mom pulls up to the curb, I jump into her car. My distress is clearly showing.</p><p>\u201cBaby?\u201d she whispers, and the floodgates open. Tears stream down my face, and I no longer try to fight what I\u2019m feeling.</p><p>\u201cHome, Mom, please,\u201d I beg, looking out the window. I know if I look at her, I\u2019ll just cry harder.</p><p>\u201cMegan, you have to tell me if someone hurt you. You\u2019re scaring me. I\u2019ve never seen you like this,\u201d she pleads with me.</p> <p>Looking over at her I reassure her. \u201cJust my heart, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes soften at my words. \u201cIce cream and shopping it is.\u201d</p><p>We pull away from the school, and a silent breath leaves my lungs, thankful that Chris didn\u2019t make it there before we left.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m up for it.\u201d I stare out the window, wiping tears from my eyes.</p><p>\u201cThey opened a new vintage game shop in the shopping center by the lakes.\u201d I look back over at her and see she has a soft smile on her face. \u201cIf he made you cry and isn\u2019t chasing you down, he\u2019s not worth it, baby. They should always chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just have no idea what I\u2019m doing, Mom. I\u2019ve never been\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn love?\u201d she finishes for me, and I just nod my head. I\u2019m totally clueless. Part of me thinks I\u2019m overreacting, that I should sit down with Chris and talk this out, but the other part of me is telling me to run scared. I don\u2019t know if I can\u2019t handle what he might have to say.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll talk it out,\u201d she says, like it\u2019s that simple.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can with you, Mom. It\u2019s, well, awkward.\u201d The idea of talking to my mom about boys seems weird, but maybe because I\u2019ve never done it before. There was never anyone else. Only him.</p><p>\u201cMegan, you\u2019re eighteen years old. I know what your father and I were doing when I was eighteen. You\u2019re a woman, I\u2019m a woman. It\u2019s only awkward if you let it be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIce cream it is,\u201d I say.</p><p>She smiles and nods, heading in the direction of the ice cream shop.</p><p>Lying in bed, I stare up at the ceiling. I told my mom as much as I could without giving away who I was crying over. We spent the day shopping and talking, I texted Croy to let him know I wasn\u2019t going to the dance, and I felt a little better about everything.</p><p>My mom was right. If it\u2019s meant to be, it\u2019s meant to be. It just crushes me to think that Chris might have had what we shared with someone else at one time. That he considered having a baby with another woman eats me alive. I felt so special when I thought of this being something we only felt for each other. This need to be together clawing at both of us was special. Uncontrollable and unexplainable, it was just there. How things were supposed to be.</p> <p>Chris came crashing in when I wasn't sure what I wanted from life. Feeling a little lost, like I didn't fit in anywhere. But with him, it felt like I fit perfectly. That I\u2019d just been lost in my head, waiting for him to come find me and pull me out.</p><p>It\u2019s why I can\u2019t talk to him right now. I don\u2019t want to hear what he has to say about everything. About who or what that woman was to him. I already feel like I could shatter into a million pieces.</p><p>Before he came along, I was so scared about the next chapter in my life and of what it was going to bring. College was the obvious next step. I had filled out the forms, made the grades, took the test, and had no problems getting early acceptance letters. Except the thing is, I don't want to go to college. I was driven to get in because I thought it was what I was supposed to do. Pushed from one world I didn\u2019t fit into to another.</p><p>The dream of making a life with Chris and continuing to write was what I wanted. But part of that dream might be slipping through my fingers. When I told my mom today I wasn't sure I wanted to go to college, she told me she stood behind whatever I chose, that I\u2019ve always been a smart girl and I would figure it out. I think she was so happy that I was showing interest in the opposite sex for once in my life. I can see dreams of grandbabies floating around in her head already.</p><p>It\u2019s why I went so hard for Chris and didn't hold anything back. For the first time in my life, things seemed to line up. I pushed my insecurities away and went after him. Maybe this was all my doing. I pushed myself on him during a time he was vulnerable. Maybe he was still torn up about this woman, and I slid nicely into the role for him.</p><p>I\u2019m so confused about where to go from here. I even talked to my mom about withdrawing from school. I have the credits to graduate. I don\u2019t need to be there. I just need to decide what I want to do with my life, and a big portion of that involves Chris.</p><p>My mom was hell-bent on finding out who I was seeing. She tried incessantly to get it out of me. I was sure she would tell me that the feeling would pass and that I was in too deep too fast, she surprised me by telling me that from the first moment she saw my dad, she knew. They were inseparable from day one, so she made me feel better about heartache after such a short time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In a perfect world I could get Chris. And I\u2019d be okay with the fact that he wanted a family with someone else before me. It shouldn\u2019t bother me, but it does. Maybe he still wants to be with her. She would probably fit him better. No sneaking around or having to deal with someone who has no idea what she\u2019s doing when it comes to relationships. Someone like me.</p><p>The screech of brakes makes me sit up in bed. It\u2019s followed closely by the sound of the front door slamming open.</p><p>\u201cMegan!\u201d</p><p>8</p> <p>Chris</p><p>I drove by her house a dozen times, and I couldn\u2019t see a car in the driveway. I went everywhere I could think of. I decide to drive by her house again. I won't stop searching until I find her, even if it means I do it forever. When I see Janet\u2019s and Phil\u2019s cars out front, I tear into the driveway. I jump out and bust through the front door, shouting her name. I just have to see her. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve gone this long without her since this all began.</p><p>I rush through the kitchen and see Janet standing there, her eyes wide with shock and worry. I must look like a mess, but I feel like I\u2019ve gone crazy. I round the corner, and see Phil leaning against the door frame.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s upstairs.\u201d</p><p>His tone of voice is calm and knowing. I need to tell him. \u201cPhil\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve known for some time, but I wanted you to man up and tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about the way this happened, but I\u2019m not sorry I love her. I don\u2019t know why or how, but she\u2019s the one. She\u2019s it for me.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me and searches my eyes, for what, I don\u2019t know. But he must see what he needs, because he nods his head. \u201cI won\u2019t lie and tell you this is easy for me. She\u2019s my baby girl, she\u2019ll always be my baby girl, but I know she won\u2019t find better.\u201d He reaches his hand out to mine and I take his, thankful for his approval.</p><p>\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d Janet says behind me, and I see Phil smile sweetly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain later, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d Megan\u2019s voice from behind Phil makes me snap to attention.</p> <p>\u201cBaby, listen. You\u2019ve got to let me explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard everything. I thought I was special. I thought I was different. But you and that woman, you...you were going to marry her.\u201d</p><p>A frustrating rage fills my veins and I want to scream. I take a deep breath and try to explain this as swiftly as possible. I need to take her hurt away. I can see she\u2019s torn up about this, and I never intended for this to happen.</p><p>\u201cThat woman, Delilah, she and I went on one date together five years ago. Five years ago. I was traveling a lot with the team then, but even still I knew she was trouble and ended it after that one dinner. She went crazy, Megan. She went to the press, said we were engaged, said she was pregnant with my baby...I never even touched her.\u201d</p><p>Megan crosses her arms defensively, still looking at me in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cI swear to God, Megan. It\u2019s the truth. It\u2019s probably still online somewhere. I had to get a restraining order, and I sued her. We settled out of court and she swore never to bother me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, Delilah is back?\u201d I hear Janet say behind me. Janet and Phil were my rocks back then, helping get me through that mess. I felt like such a dick taking her to court, but they both kept reminding me that she needed serious help.</p><p>\u201cI called the cops and they took her to the hospital. From what they said, she\u2019d been under her sister's care, but had a recent relapse when her boyfriend broke up with her. Guess she was just making the rounds.\u201d</p> <p>Megan looks back and forth between her parents, and I can see hope in her eyes. \u201cDad, is this true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She was really unstable, and I was able to get a psychologist friend of mine to look over the case,\u201d he says, confirming everything I said.</p><p>\u201cHoney, if I had known that was the problem, I could have told you the whole story. My God, you and Chris? When did this happen?\u201d Janet sounds utterly shocked.</p><p>Megan blushes profusely, and looks at me through her lashes.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Janet, let\u2019s give them a chance to talk.\u201d</p><p>Phil pulls her from the room as she keeps asking questions. \u201cHow did you...\u201d I hear her saying over her shoulder as they walk out.</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t want babies with her?\u201d she asks, looking down at her feet. I hate that she thought I wanted with someone else what I only want with her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Megan takes a tentative step towards me, and I stand my ground, not wanting to scare her off. I\u2019m sure I look crazy. I felt crazy when she left me today. The thought of her running from me was like a hot blade to my heart. She\u2019s it for me. If she doesn't want me, I'll live out a miserable existence. Or I'll have to buy a secluded island, kidnap her, and keep her there.</p><p>\u201cAnd you never wanted to marry her?\u201d she asks, looking up at me through her eyelashes.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I fire back instantly.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t love her?\u201d</p><p>She takes another small step forward, and I can feel my heart beating out of my chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve loved one woman in my life, and that\u2019s you, Megan. I love you.\u201d</p><p>She rushes the rest of the way and I catch her, wrapping my arms around her.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Chris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home, baby.\u201d</p><p>I feel her nod against my neck, and I close my eyes. Finally my world is whole again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Epilogue</p><p>MEGAN</p><p>Ten years later...</p><p>\u201cHafy Bifby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>Chris moves his mouth away from my pussy, licking his lips. \u201cI said \u2018happy birthday.\u2019\u201d I giggle as he dives back between my legs, licking and sucking his way to my orgasm.</p><p>I stretch my arms over my head, spreading my legs wider. This isn\u2019t a bad way to start my twenty-eighth year. I grip his hair in my hands, grinding against his face, never getting tired of the way he feels on my body.</p><p>We\u2019ve been through so much, and getting to this moment was hard fought, but goddamn, was it worth it.</p><p>Surprisingly, my parents were thrilled that Chris and I were together, and we didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but having that support meant all the difference. I opted out of my last year of high school and graduated early. Chris and I didn\u2019t go public until it was official, but the backlash was awful. He coached the high school to a state championship with an undefeated season and still they wanted him out. The school board created a new contract for him to sign that was just bullshit to push him out of the door. He didn\u2019t need the money or the attention, so he just went quietly, not making a scene. My heart broke for him, because all he ever wanted to do was to be involved in football, even if it was coaching.</p><p>After a year of sulking about it, I suggested he get involved in a local \u2018big brother\u2019 football camp. Ever since then, he\u2019s found his purpose again. He\u2019s been there eight years, and loves seeing the boys grow and develop.</p><p>I was pretty much treated the same way I was before senior year of high school, like the awkward girl no one knew what to do with. But I was used to it, so it was no skin off my nose. I got pregnant the minute Chris got inside me, giving birth to our son, Chris Junior, nine months later. After that, we had our daughter Fae, and then our other daughter Mara. My pregnancy with Mara was difficult, so after that, we decided it was time to close the baby chapter. Our family is happy and healthy, and that\u2019s all I ever wanted.</p><p>\u201cFuck, baby, I can\u2019t wait. I need to get inside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my birthday! Don\u2019t I get a say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter this, I need to take the edge off.\u201d Chris scoots up the bed, thrusting inside me, hard and fast. \u201cGoddamn, eating that pussy gets me so fucking hard.\u201d</p><p>He reaches between us, rubbing my clit, and then leans down to kiss me, letting me taste myself. The flavor of my need combined with his hard cock fucking me tests my limits. Chris pulls back, putting a hand over my mouth as I shout my release. I feel myself squirt on his cock, drenching him in my cum.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d He buries his face in my neck, biting me there while he empties inside me. The feeling of his warm cum flooding me makes me twitch and sparks off another, smaller orgasm.</p><p>\u201cMom! Grandma is here to take me to soccer practice!\u201d I hear Fae yell from the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cTonight the kids are going to your parents\u2019,\u201d Chris says as he licks my nipple, sucking it into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do with an empty house and all this time on our hands?\u201d I giggle as I rub his hairy chest. God, he\u2019s forty and just getting sexier with every year that passes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we can think of something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you put on that Darth Vader mask I got you and you punish me for being a rebel?\u201d</p><p>He gets a wicked look in his eye and nods his head. \u201cI think I\u2019d enjoy showing you my Lightsaber.\u201d</p><p>We fall into giggling pile as we roll around in our happily ever after.</p> <p>THE END </p> </body></html>"]
