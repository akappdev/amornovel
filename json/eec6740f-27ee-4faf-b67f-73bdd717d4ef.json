Most of them looked as sickly as the king\u2019s guards, which explained their rage. He had given up trying to fathom why they had blamed him, a common poacher, for the plague that had swept through Sherwood. The jailer\u2019s whip and cudgel had beaten the caring out of him.</p><p>The gibbet, made of four old, toppled druids\u2019 stones around a lightning-struck dead oak, stood empty for once. A stained length of rope hung from the thickest of the blackened, twisted branches, and had been knotted into a noose at the very end. Liam had seen bodies of the condemned left to hang for months; they didn\u2019t fall until the local crows literally picked them to pieces.</p> <p>Compared to his fate, that now seemed almost merciful.</p><p>Two more guards, armed with short swords, waited on either side of the stones. The horses they held by their bridles were big, bulky shire mares he had seen plowing a field to the north. He had hoped for a pair of swift hunters, but no, they meant to make him suffer until his last breath. Then, when it was finished, they would drop what was left of him in tar before hanging him from the gates of town.</p><p>The sun burned his eyes, as he had been imprisoned away from it for three months or better, and no one had given him so much as a candle stub to light his dark cell. They had stopped bringing him food when he had begun coughing, and he had thought the starvation would have finished him off, but no, \u2019twas just his bitter luck to have survived the sickness so that they might execute him. He didn\u2019t feel hungry anymore, not since his last beating, but he would have traded his soul for a drink of cool water.</p><p>\u201cLet me through.\u201d A thin, dirty girl in a stained over shift and threadbare under gown pushed past the jeering villeins and threw herself to the ground in front of the guard. \u201cPlease, marster, I beg you, give me leave to say a prayer wi\u2019 Red.\u201d</p><p>The guard kicked at her. \u201cAway with ye, wench.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She looked up, tears making her pale eyes huge. \u201cHe were kind to my ma before she passed. He brought soup and chopped wood for her.\u201d</p><p>Liam swore under his breath. He\u2019d told Clary to keep her distance, but she never listened. At least she hadn\u2019t called him by his real name\u2014that would have made everything he\u2019d suffered for naught.</p><p>\u201cLet the slut bid her lover farewell,\u201d someone yelled, setting off dozens of shouted agreements.</p><p>\u201cPray you fast, wench.\u201d The guard picked up Clary by the back of her shift and tossed her toward Liam.</p><p>Liam brought up his hands too late to catch her, and his manacles became caught between their faces as she knocked him flat on his back. He almost bit through his tongue, and saw bright red blood streak down her chin.</p><p>\u201cClary, why are you here?\u201d He pressed the shreds of his sleeve against the split in her lower lip. \u201cYou promised.\u201d</p> <p>She bent as if to kiss his cheek, and whispered, \u201cYour master is coming for you.\u201d</p><p>He almost laughed. \u201cThe Prince of Trees, rescue me? He cannot even save himself.\u201d He glanced down at her overtunic, smelled soot and rot, and his amusement vanished. \u201cMy God, girl. What have you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needed the silver. The cottage was not mine, nor the mill. I had nothing else to sell.\u201d She tried to smile. \u201c\u2019Twill not be forever. You will come back.\u201d</p><p>She had sold herself into service to pay a madman to save a fool. Were he not so dry, Liam would have wept. \u201cAye, love. I will come for you.\u201d If not in this life, then in the next.</p><p>She yanked the cord from around her neck and pressed the small wooden cross hanging from it into his hand. \u201cI will be waiting.\u201d She pulled him to his feet. \u201cGod bless and keep you, Red.\u201d</p><p>Liam gripped the tiny cross. At least there was one soul in all the world who didn\u2019t despise him\u2014at least, not yet. When she would have drawn back, he held on to her hands and kissed her mouth, and for a long moment the world went away. When he lifted his head, he was almost glad he was about to die, for the look in her wide eyes would have haunted him forever.</p><p>The guard took hold of her and shoved her back into the crowd. A moment later she was gone.</p><p>\u201cAttend me, all ye here,\u201d the bailiff shouted before he read from the scroll in his hands.</p> <p>\u201cThe man known as Mad Red has been found guilty of plotting and devising an uprising against his majesty the king, in a felonious and treasonable effort to overthrow the monarchy. In full knowledge of his own wickedness, he arranged for men of mercenary persuasion to act as accomplices, the very same men who came into England sick with the pestilence that has now stricken our land. Therefore, being devoted to the cause of justice, wishing to maintain and defend his gracious majesty, to tear out by the roots such heresies in his kingdom, to the best of our ability, and to inflict a fitting punishment on the convict according to both human and divine law, and to canon law customarily observed in such cases, the aforesaid traitor Mad Red will be hanged, drawn, and quartered within the liberty of the town as a clear example to his majesty\u2019s other subjects of how abhorrent is this kind of crime. So ordered by the Sherriff of Nottingham on this day, the seventeenth of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand twelve hundred ninety-eight.\u201d He rolled up the scroll and turned to face Liam. \u201cMad Red, have you any last words before sentence is passed?\u201d</p><p>A fist-size stone struck Liam\u2019s temple, and his vision blurred as blood streaked down his face. \u201cI\u2019m no traitor or killer. Ask your wife.\u201d</p><p>The bailiff spit on the ground. \u201cGod have mercy on your black soul.\u201d</p><p>The hooded executioner, a tall, lean, grinning fellow with scarred hands, slipped the noose over Liam\u2019s bloodied head. \u201cRed, if you are not too mad,\u201d he said in a low, husky voice, \u201cI would beg your forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>He scowled up at the shadowed face. \u201cBreak my neck on the first draw, and you\u2019ll have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, and cheat these fine folk of this spectacle of justice?\u201d The hangman cuffed the back of his head. \u201cDo that and I\u2019ll be the next one to dangle.\u201d He produced a black hood. \u201cNot to worry. It\u2019ll be quick, lad.\u201d</p><p>Liam closed his eyes. \u201cBe done with it, then.\u201d</p><p>The black wool hood felt suffocating, especially when the hangman jerked the slipknot tight around his throat. He felt the screams he had fought for three months boiling up inside him, but he would not let them loose, not even if he had to bite through his own tongue to silence them.</p><p>The rope bit into his neck as he was yanked off his feet and dangled helplessly. He expected the choking, but not the roar of fury inside his head. Bright spots of eerie light danced on the insides of his eyelids as he felt his heartbeat slow. Just as the thick wool of the hood seemed to swallow his mind, something hissed near his ear and the rope snapped. He fell, landing with a brutal thud face down in the cold dirt, his wrist snapping under the weight of his body.</p><p>The little wooden cross fell from his limp fingers into the dirt.</p><p>Next they will slice me open, Liam thought, gasping in precious air and trying to brace himself as rough hands jerked him up. He hoped that Clary had gone, prayed that she had, for she did not have to know this day that she had sold her freedom for nothing. He heard steel sliding from a sheath and went still, but he didn\u2019t fear the blades as much as the horses. He realized that his last moments on this earth would be spent in unimaginable agony. Any moment now they would hack into his body, tie it to the horses, and then drive them to pull it apart. His bones would crack and his flesh would tear\u2014slowly\u2014before it was done, and at last he could sleep. As the tip of a blade pressed against his belly, Liam realized something else, something that bewildered him.</p><p>He could no longer hear any voices at all.</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>APRIL 17, 2008</p><p>\u201cKnow what the three greatest pleasures in life are, buddy?\u201d</p><p>Will Scarlet glanced at the inebriated mortal and the sweaty, beefy hand he had dropped on his shoulder. \u201cSobriety, courtesy, and daily attention to one\u2019s personal hygiene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong.\u201d The drunk grinned. \u201cBlondes, brunettes, and redheads.\u201d He leaned over and dropped his voice to a liquor-scented whisper as he pointed past Will. \u201cSee that one down there, the one in the pink? I\u2019ve had my eye on her all night. She\u2019s been acting real particular and standoffish, but you know it\u2019s an act. She didn\u2019t come here to leave alone. She only wants a real man.\u201d</p><p>Will didn\u2019t have to look at the slim, stylish woman on the other side of the bar; he\u2019d been watching her since following her and his master into this place. \u201cPerhaps she\u2019s waiting for someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight she is. Me.\u201d The mortal straightened and used his belt to hitch up his trousers. \u201cNow watch and learn something, buddy.\u201d He staggered off toward the redhead.</p><p>Will followed his progress by watching the mirror behind the bar. During his mortal life, he, too, had pursued his pleasures\u2014wine, women, and song\u2014with the same dogged, oblivious determination. Had he not, he would not be sitting in this noisy, crowded nightclub, surrounded by bountiful measures of all three. He would certainly not be wishing for silence, solitude, and a cup of tea. He would be long gone and forgotten, a layer of dust in an ancient unmarked grave.</p><p>The glass of red wine he was neglecting, while of pitifully infantile vintage, was far superior to the thick, sour stuff he had drunk too much of as a youth. For all its clarity and sophistication, however, it had no spine to it. Perfumed water had more character.</p><p>Then there were the ladies, in which he generally had a considerable interest. No woman from his village would have dared display as much beauty or skin as the innumerable females milling about this place. Certainly women of this era were prettier and smelled infinitely cleaner, but like the wine, they, too, had little substance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As for song...</p><p>Will turned to eye the three bards playing their electronic instruments with mechanical indifference. They cared nothing for the music they produced; that much was obvious. As for the one singing, had he screeched like that in public during Will\u2019s time, he would have been carted off as a madman.</p><p>The Bar with a View had only two merits, as far as Will was concerned: It was within walking distance of his master\u2019s city home, and it closed at two a.m. Within the next hour he\u2019d see to it that Robin was suitably occupied for the evening and perhaps steal a few hours for himself.</p> <p>Gilded emerald eyes looked out of memories he should have banished centuries ago. You could stop. You could stay with me, and take me to wife.</p><p>It is too late for me now, child.</p><p>Then take me with you.</p><p>Will rubbed his brow. Claris of Aubury had been dead and buried for centuries, and still not a day went by that he didn\u2019t think of her in some fashion. He could recall perfectly every word she had ever spoken in his presence, exactly as she had said them. He could sketch the sweet grace of her countenance in his thoughts whenever he closed his eyes. Sometimes, when he felt most alone, he thought he could smell her skin, and taste again that one, sweet kiss he had stolen from her.</p><p>Take me with you.</p> <p>After Clary\u2019s mother had died of the coughing sickness, Clary\u2019d had no one else in the world but him. He\u2019d known that. But by the time she was old enough to marry, he\u2019d been branded an outlaw. To save her from sharing his fate he\u2019d left her behind, and in doing so sacrificed her and any hope of happiness. When he had become Kyn, he had gone back for her, only to discover he had lost her again, this time to her own frail mortality. The orphaned girl had died alone and friendless, her body carted away to be burned with the other victims of the plague.</p><p>Perhaps that was why she had lingered in his mind for so long. She had no one else to haunt.</p><p>\u201cAnyone sitting here?\u201d</p><p>A young female dressed in a dark business suit stood indicating the empty bar stool next to Will\u2019s, but she addressed another female sitting on the other side. He didn\u2019t care for her ignoring him, her dismal garments, or the tight way she\u2019d pinned her honey-colored hair to the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d the other woman said. \u201cGo ahead; he\u2019s not coming back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She placed a slim briefcase under the edge of the bar before taking the seat and waving a ringless hand at the bartender. When he came over, she said, \u201cCoffee, black, please.\u201d</p> <p>As she took out a mobile phone and began reading text messages, Will watched her. Cleverly applied eye and lip color and that torturous topknot of hair couldn\u2019t disguise how young she was. Her jewelry, a pair of simple gray pearl ear studs and a modest string of the same around her slim throat, seemed too drab.</p><p>To add to his annoyance, tonight she had sprayed herself with some expensive scent that women fancied made them seem more alluring. That vexed him more than mannish clothing; he liked the natural smell of a woman\u2019s skin.</p><p>She reached for the coffee the bartender brought her, causing her sleeve to slide back and reveal a small oval shadow on the inside of her right wrist. No profile had yet been etched in the center of her black cameo tattoo, nor would there be until she pledged her loyalty to the immortal Darkyn lord she chose to serve. Will had been hoping for the last six months that it would be the face of his lord, Robin of Locksley.</p><p>As she sipped the vile-smelling brew, she tapped something on the diminutive, slide-out keyboard of her phone\u2014but she still didn\u2019t address or look at him.</p><p>Amused, Will leaned closer and spoke in an exaggerated American drawl. \u201cAre you angry with me, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your sweetheart.\u201d She glanced up, impatient. \u201cAnd why would I be angry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny number of reasons, I daresay.\u201d He watched as the bartender walked past. \u201cSo how shall I get back into your good graces?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were never out of them.\u201d She leaned over and gave his cheek a surprisingly chaste kiss. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again, Will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou might have seen more of me\u201d\u2014he turned her face so he could return the kiss on her soft mouth\u2014\u201chad you come to my bed last night, as you promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork takes priority.\u201d Something flickered in her eyes, chased away by her smile. \u201cYou know how it is.\u201d</p><p>Officially Reese Carmichael was employed by Archer Enterprises as an advertising executive who promoted the various products and goods produced by the Atlanta jardin. Unofficially she served Robin of Locksley as one of his many human servants. Reese knew exactly what he and Will were, because she had been born into a family of tresori, mortals who had served and protected the Kyn for more than five hundred years. They had also trained her to do the same.</p><p>They had been casual lovers for the last year. All their busy lives permitted was a stolen night together once or twice each month, and most of the time Will was glad of it. Like him, Reese was strong and energetic, in the very prime of her life. Unlike him she would grow older by the year until her time to pass came.</p><p>\u201cI do. All the same, I missed you.\u201d He picked up her warm hand and kissed the back of it before holding it between his cool palms. \u201cSo, what have you been doing that keeps you so damnably busy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a regional sales conference going on this week for sporting equipment manufacturers and distributors.\u201d She made a face. \u201cI had one of the last presentations of the day, and as usual the program schedule ran insanely late.\u201d</p><p>As she told him of her work, Will watched her face. Reese did not use the wretched beige-colored paint so many females did that made the face into an anonymous mask; for this he was grateful. She possessed exquisite skin, smooth and golden as warm cream, that took on a slight glow no matter what light played over it. Tonight he noticed it more than he had in the past, perhaps because he wanted so badly to taste every inch of it.</p><p>She glanced around him. \u201cWhere\u2019s his lordship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff in the shadows.\u201d He nodded toward Rob, who was sitting on the other side of the room and trying to intrigue the young red-haired female he had lured to him. \u201cHe\u2019s rather occupied this evening.\u201d He felt her touch his sleeve. \u201cDo you like my new shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always loved that color.\u201d She smiled. \u201cNot many men would be brave enough to wear as much red as you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with red?\u201d Indignant now, he regarded his shirt and trousers. \u201c\u2019Tis a cheerful color. Father Christmas wears it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do prostitutes.\u201d She chuckled and tapped his side with her elbow. \u201cI\u2019m just giving you a hard time. I like it; it makes a statement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo does your undertaker\u2019s suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis, I will have you know, is the latest in unisex professional wear.\u201d She made a contemptuous sound. \u201cSomeday, when I actually own my soul again and don\u2019t have to worry about how I\u2019m perceived by the old boys of advertising, I\u2019m going to burn everything in my closet. Until then, it\u2019s nothing but dressing like I don\u2019t possess breasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d burn now and worry later.\u201d In the bar mirror Will saw Robin speaking to the redhead. \u201cI think I\u2019m about to be relieved of my duties for the evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I need to talk to you somewhere quieter.\u201d She emptied her cup of coffee before she slid to her feet. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>Will didn\u2019t want to leave the club, but it didn\u2019t appear as if Robin needed him, and it was obvious that something was troubling Reese. She spoke and behaved with her usual careless charm, but tonight her smile didn\u2019t reach her eyes.</p><p>Fortunately he knew how best to chase away her worries.</p><p>Will followed her out of the club and into the maze of corridors leading to the elevators, the front desk, and the exercise room. When he saw where she meant to go, he caught her around the waist and guided her in a different direction.</p><p>She glanced down the short, empty corridor. \u201cI think we\u2019d be more comfortable in the lobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo many people.\u201d He took the hotel key card from his pocket and unlocked the day manager\u2019s office door. \u201cNo one will interrupt us in here.\u201d</p><p>With coy reluctance she went inside. \u201cI\u2019m working on the winter catalog, and I\u2019d like to have the new line of composite bows photographed at Rosethorn.\u201d She retreated behind the manager\u2019s desk, placed her briefcase on it, and opened it. \u201cI\u2019ve never been out to the estate, so I\u2019ll need to spend some time there, find the most attractive setting for the shoot, that sort of thing. Can you arrange it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Will secured the latch. \u201cI\u2019ll take you on a tour myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary. Why are you bolting the door?\u201d</p><p>He turned and crossed the red-and-gold paisley carpet. \u201cGuess.\u201d</p><p>She again feigned impatience. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for this, Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not?\u201d He backed her into the filing cabinet, catching her wrist and bringing her hand against him. She\u2019d never made him this hard this fast, and he could see that it startled her as much as it did him. \u201cWhat have you time for, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to go to Rosethorn.\u201d She shuddered as he kissed her neck. \u201cTomorrow night would be best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re here now.\u201d The pungent scent on her skin made him draw back and frown. \u201cChrist Almighty, Reese. Did you spill a bottle of that perfume on yourself? \u2019Tis all over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was on the phone when I put it on. I probably went a little overboard.\u201d She glanced down as he began opening her jacket. \u201cWill, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>If he didn\u2019t get inside her soon, Will thought he\u2019d go mad. \u201cAs you wish, my lady.\u201d He dragged her down to the carpet, shoving her skirt up over her hips.</p><p>She tried to sit up as he bent down, and their mouths fused together. By the time he broke the kiss he had worked himself free of his trousers and was pressing into her softness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBloody hell.\u201d He gritted his teeth as her body resisted him. \u201cRelax, sweetheart. It\u2019s just me. Let me in. Let me love you.\u201d</p><p>Reese began to say something, and then she closed her eyes, her body arching up as he went deeper.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d Will eased into her, forcing himself to go gently rather than hammer into her. \u201cCan you let me...There, yes, like that.\u201d He had breached her to the hilt, and held still to feel the faint flutters against his shaft as her body adjusted to him. He had always delighted in her warmth and willingness, but for some reason tonight she was as tense and tight as a new bride. \u201cEasy, sweetheart. It\u2019s only me.\u201d</p> <p>Will had enjoyed making love to her dozens of times, but never once had it felt as this did. She clenched around him as he drew out of her, dragging at him as if she meant to keep him buried deep. When he forged in again, tears spilled from the corners of her eyes.</p><p>He froze. He\u2019d never forced a woman in his life, and yet here she was, soft and slick and warm around him, and weeping in silence.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she muttered as he disengaged his body from hers. \u201cDo it. Finish it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with you crying on me like that, sweetheart.\u201d He straightened her garments and his before he lifted her from the floor and put her on his lap. \u201cWhat did I do? Was I too rough? Did I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not you.\u201d She wiped the tears from her face with quick fingers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s been a long time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReese. It\u2019s been three weeks.\u201d He caught her chin in his hand and made her look at him. \u201cYou really don\u2019t want this. Damn me, but I thought you were jesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault, not yours,\u201d she said, easing out of his grip and standing. \u201cI\u2019m just tired, that\u2019s all. I wanted it to be special. Another time, okay?\u201d</p><p>Will couldn\u2019t tell if she was lying; the perfume she wore kept him from detecting the changes in her scent. \u201cI\u2019ll call for a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought my own.\u201d She tugged at the hem of her skirt. \u201cWould you arrange for me to have access to Rosethorn tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn one condition.\u201d He took her hand in his, startled to feel how cold she was. \u201cWill you forgive me for behaving like a brute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to forgive.\u201d She hesitated before she stood on her toes and kissed his mouth, her lips soft and damp. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d She unlocked the door and fled.</p> <p>Will considered following her, but the taste of her tears still lingered on his mouth. That and her strange reaction to his lovemaking had him in complete upheaval. She was his friend, his lover\u2014how could his advances have shocked her? Why would she refuse him after they had found pleasure in each other so many times?</p><p>Reese\u2019s tresoran training included a thorough understanding of the ways of his kind. She knew how determined Kyn males became when they were aroused by a human female. Centuries of discipline and self-denial had taught Will to control his instincts and appetites, so she had never been in any real danger. He would rather fall on a bed of copper swords before he hurt a woman, mortal or Kyn, and yet...He suddenly realized something else that had happened, something he barely recalled.</p><p>In those stark moments as he had pulled her to the floor and put himself between her soft thighs, his dents ac\u00e9r\u00e9es had stretched into his mouth, fully extended, eager for the hot richness of her blood.</p><p>This, when he\u2019d fed well from the stores Robin kept at the penthouse before escorting his master to the club. His need for human blood, the only form of nourishment he could take, should not have returned until he woke tomorrow night. Nor should he have had such a primal reaction to Reese. In all the months they\u2019d been lovers, he\u2019d never once been tempted to feed on her. Tonight he suspected he could have drained her dry.</p><p>Had she seen his fangs emerge, and thought he was becoming enthralled? Was that what had frightened her so much? Worse than that, could she have been right?</p><p>Unsettled by his thoughts, Will returned to the nightclub, in time to see his master walk to the dance floor and take the red-haired woman into his arms. Rather than moving close to Robin, the female stepped back, deliberately holding him off as if she meant to maintain a respectable distance between them.</p><p>Not for much longer, little mortal. Will knew that a few humans had the natural ability to resist l\u2019attrait, the scent shed by the Darkyn to lure and control those upon whom they fed. But no one could resist Robin of Locksley\u2019s talent, which charmed any mortal he touched. In a few moments, the redhead would succumb to his master\u2019s ability and begin clinging to him like a thirsty vine.</p><p>\u201cAre you here with anyone?\u201d a hopeful voice asked.</p> <p>Will barely glanced at the woman. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She began to pass him, but then turned back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t mean to bother you, but do you think your date would mind if I asked you to dance?\u201d</p><p>Dancing would allow Will to get closer and watch the redhead\u2019s defenses crumble. Given Reese\u2019s rejection, the urge was a masochistic one, but he was also obliged by duty now to assure that the woman valiantly resisting his master hadn\u2019t been trained to do so.</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d He grasped her hand and led her to the edge of the open space in front of the band. There he took the woman into his arms and finally looked at her. Her makeup, clothes, and hairstyle were those of an older woman trying rather desperately to appear younger. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRosalyn.\u201d She ran the tip of her tongue over her top teeth before she smiled. \u201cWhat\u2019s yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam.\u201d He shed a little scent, just enough to make her pupils expand. \u201cRest your head on my shoulder, dear lady, follow my lead, and listen to the music.\u201d</p><p>Rosalyn happily obeyed him.</p><p>Will didn\u2019t crowd Robin and his partner, but guided Rosalyn close enough so that he could overhear their conversation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty, isn\u2019t it?\u201d the redhead was asking his master. \u201cI think it was the only hit Spandau Ballet ever had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpandau Ballet,\u201d Rob repeated. \u201cI cannot say that I am familiar with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore our time,\u201d his partner said. \u201cMy mother loved this song.\u201d Her expression and the tone of her voice changed. \u201cHow did you know what I was drinking? Did you ask the waitress or the bartender?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither.\u201d Robin studied her face. \u201cI could smell the ginger ale on your breath.\u201d</p><p>Will was obliged to lead Rosalyn around another couple, which took him out of earshot. He glanced back and saw his master bend his head, close enough to kiss the woman in his arms, but the mortal reacted by stiffening and drawing back.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil is wrong with that woman?\u201d he muttered under his breath.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Rosalyn lifted her face. \u201cDo you want me to go and ask her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my dear.\u201d He knew better than to speak without thinking around a be spelled mortal. \u201cYou dance beautifully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d Her eyes brightened. \u201cI come here twice a week, but no one ever asks me to dance. I\u2019m too old for them, you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they are fools,\u201d he assured her, \u201cfor you are lovely and graceful.\u201d</p><p>She breathed in deeply and turned her head slowly toward Robin. \u201cDo you think he would dance with me?\u201d</p><p>Will caught the deep, hot fragrance of bergamot, and turned her around so that he could see Robin\u2019s face. His master no longer smiled, but seemed wholly intent on the red-haired woman. As a beam of light flashed across the dance floor, it illuminated Robin\u2019s dark violet eyes, which now glowed like polished coins.</p><p>The only time Robin of Locksley\u2019s eyes turned to copper was when he hunted.</p><p>\u201cIf this is a practical joke, it\u2019s a good one,\u201d the mortal was saying to Robin. \u201cDid Hutchins put you up to it?\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s master replied in a voice so low it sounded only like a low growl. He saw Robin glance toward the exit leading out to the elevators. He could guess what his master was thinking\u2014he wanted to take the female to the top floor, where all the rooms were kept reserved for their use\u2014but the redhead wasn\u2019t acting as if she were be spelled. In fact, she seemed utterly oblivious to Robin\u2019s state.</p><p>The scent of bergamot grew stronger, spreading out over the dancing couples and enticing their attention away from one another. Soon every mortal within twenty feet was staring openly at Robin and his partner.</p><p>\u201cOh, bloody hell.\u201d Will whirled Rosalyn through the bemused gauntlet of dancers to take her to the edge of the dance floor. Scanning the room, he saw an older man with a kind face sitting alone. \u201cDo you see that man there?\u201d When Rosalyn nodded, he said, \u201cGo and join him. Talk to him. If you like him, ask him to dance with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoin. Talk. Dance.\u201d She nodded and drifted away.</p><p>Will turned to look for Robin. Instead he met the gaze of the redhead, and saw open curiosity in her brandy-colored eyes. She kept watching him as she spoke to Robin, who finally gave Will his attention.</p><p>Robin turned until his partner\u2019s back faced Will, and made a pointed gesture of dismissal.</p><p>Will scowled in return. He didn\u2019t want to leave his master surrounded by dozens of be spelled humans, but he knew Robin badly wanted the woman, and doubted he would remain in the club much longer. Patience had never been one of Robin\u2019s strengths.</p><p>As he wove his way through the crowd gathering around the dance floor, walking toward the exit, Will saw Rosalyn and the older man sitting close together and talking, apparently engrossed in each other. Robin\u2019s scent still lingered on the air, and in the past it had often had a curious effect on large groups of humans exposed to it. Tonight it seemed to be having a mild aphrodisiac effect on the patrons, judging by the sudden pairings and hasty departures.</p><p>Everyone will have their lover tonight, Will thought, except me.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>Reese waited until Will Scarlet had left the nightclub before she left her observation post and walked out to the parking garage. Everything had gone exactly as it should have, and she had played her part flawlessly. The endless hours she had spent preparing herself had not been wasted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And, if she kept repeating that, she might even convince herself of it.</p><p>Seeing Will tonight had not gone as she had expected it would. Reese tried to think of what had changed since the last time she had seen him. Part of the problem was that he never changed, would never change. Time left its mark on mortals, not the Darkyn. It had been seven hundred years since the poacher of Aubury had escaped a gruesome end and pledged his life and loyalty to Robin of Locksley, who had taken him along on his endless quest to give to the poor by stealing from the rich. By then he had become Darkyn, and that also saved him.</p><p>Yet Will Scarlet still had no idea what he had done the day he had escaped the gibbet.</p> <p>Reese made herself recall Will\u2019s image. He\u2019d recently cut his hair himself, judging by the uneven thatch of white-gold strands above his brow. How she\u2019d longed to weave her fingers through the back of it, to feel again that soft thickness where it met the heavy muscles of his neck. His long lashes, still as white as the twin arches of his brows, had veiled the jeweled brilliance of his eyes. She imagined sitting and simply looking into those beloved eyes and listening to his voice for hours. She\u2019d dreamed of that.</p><p>Until he\u2019d taken her beyond the dreams.</p><p>You can\u2019t think about him that way, not now.</p><p>Reese knew how important the work she had to do was, and yet despite it all she wished she could run down the street to the Armstrong building, find him, and tell him the truth\u2014warn him of what was coming, and why it had to be done. He would understand. As the temptation to do exactly that grew stronger, her phone, set on silent, buzzed in her pocket.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to answer it, even as she did. \u201cYou promised that you wouldn\u2019t call.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s late. I was worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m finished here. I\u2019ve arranged to go in tomorrow night.\u201d How calm she sounded, even to her own ears.</p><p>\u201cDoes he suspect anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Father.\u201d If seeing Will tonight hadn\u2019t broken her heart, this would. \u201cI deceived him completely. Just as you instructed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I would not have asked this of you, my child, but there was no one else up to the task.\u201d His voice gentled. \u201cIt will be over soon, and then we can return home to the family. They miss you terribly.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t given her family a single thought since leaving home, but she wouldn\u2019t tell her father that. He could never know her true feelings, or the secret longing she had kept from him. If he had, he would never let her go within one hundred miles of Rosethorn. He would have left her behind.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d Before he could make any more assurances, Reese ended the call.</p><p>She walked to the green Jag she had parked in a shadowy corner. After unlocking the passenger door, she reached in and checked the pulse of the woman she had tied up and gagged.</p><p>Dark eyes, as deep and confused as her own, fluttered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d she told her captive. \u201cI\u2019m taking you to a safe place now. You won\u2019t be harmed.\u201d</p><p>The woman moaned something behind the gag in her mouth.</p><p>By the time Reese reached the safe house, her passenger was asleep. She directed the security guards to take her inside before she went to the library to make her report. When she found the room empty, she went to stand by the mantel and look down into the flames. It was too warm in this place for a fire, but he still lit one each night. He claimed he enjoyed the scent of it, but she wondered if he didn\u2019t do so for other, less pleasant reasons.</p><p>After some time her father came in carrying two glasses of wine.</p><p>\u201cThe young lady is safely installed in the guesthouse.\u201d He placed one glass on a side table and took his own to his favorite chair by the fire. \u201cMarie will take good care of her, child.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know she will.\u201d It was everything she didn\u2019t know that made her wish she were back in England.</p><p>He watched her instead of the fire. \u201cSomething happened at the club that you did not mention. I could hear it in your voice.\u201d</p><p>The ache between her thighs had disappeared, but she could still taste Will Scarlet on her lips. For a moment she considered telling him about the interlude\u2014they had never kept secrets from each other, no matter how terrible they might be\u2014and then decided against it. What had happened had meant nothing to Will, and could not change anything for her.</p><p>\u201cSeeing him\u2014being with him tonight\u2014was more difficult than I had thought it would be,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cI prepared myself for this, I meditated all afternoon before I went there, and I knew how it would be, but...\u201d Her girlish babbling shamed her. \u201cFather, I was not ready for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could not help falling in love, my child.\u201d Ennis stared into the fire. \u201cIt is a powerful and enduring emotion. Even hatred bends before its will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill and I can\u2019t be together, not like this,\u201d she said, more to reassure herself than him. \u201cI know that. I do know what I have to do, Father.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThen why were you not prepared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mission work troubles me.\u201d That much was true. \u201cThere are too many unknowns involved. How can we be certain the suzerain will steal this book? What if he decides against it, or fumbles the job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobin of Locksley does not hesitate or fumble,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cHe has been pursuing the book since it was stolen from his family centuries ago. He covets it more than any other treasure in the world. Now it has been brought into his territory, and will be on open display at a public gallery. How can the most successful thief in history resist helping himself to such a prize?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIn his eagerness, he could make a mistake.\u201d</p><p>Ennis beckoned to her. \u201cCome here to me.\u201d</p><p>She went to him and sat on the carpet in front of his chair, curling up against his long calves. She was too old to do such a childish thing, she knew, but it gave her a measure of comfort. She closed her eyes as he stroked his hand over her hair.</p><p>\u201cThis has been so painful for you,\u201d he said, his voice gentle. \u201cYour loyalty and goodness rebel against what has to be done. But, my dear, our work sometimes demands such things of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could go to him,\u201d she whispered, and felt his hand still. \u201cHe is still a good man at heart, Father. He always has been. We could tell him of the danger. If he knew\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could confide in him,\u201d Ennis agreed. \u201cYou may have forgotten to whom he has made his oath, but I assure you, Will Scarlet has not. He will in turn go to Locksley. Now, what do you think a Darkyn lord would do with the knowledge that he had obtained such power? What did they do when they discovered it the first time?\u201d</p><p>Her heart sank. \u201cLocksley would give the book to Richard.\u201d She lifted her face. \u201cBut, Father, the high lord has changed. All the reports indicate he is becoming more temperate, more reasonable. More human. He knows too well what could happen, just as we do. What if we used this as an opportunity to forge an alliance with him?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cThe Darkyn are not human. They can never be. Even as we speak, Richard has recalled his seigneurs to London. They have suffered great losses over the last three years, and are at this moment deciding whether or not to go to war with the Brethren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t wage war openly,\u201d she protested. \u201cNot without exposing their existence. They have no weapons that can escape mortal detection.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her, his eyes sad. \u201cAfter tonight they will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d She covered her face with her hands.</p><p>\u201cIf I could give this task to anyone else, I would,\u201d he assured her. \u201cTo spare you the suffering, I would do it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Father.\u201d She dropped her hands. \u201cThey would kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne cannot say I deserve any less.\u201d He stood, drawing her to her feet. The misery on his face struck at her heart. \u201cAs long as the book remains in the hands of others, the world will be in peril. We must take it back and destroy it before it is too late.\u201d He pressed his dry lips to her brow. \u201cBe brave, child, for just a little longer.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cNow, at great expense and trouble I have obtained the original building plans for Rosethorn.\u201d He gestured toward several long rolls of paper on his desk. \u201cYou will need to go over them tonight. I also have the names and photographs of every human employed by the estate. Those you must memorize, for once you are inside the house, they will be your only allies.\u201d</p><p>I have no allies. Her shoulders drooped as she went to the desk.</p><p>Her father left her alone, and she spent the next several hours reviewing the blueprints of the estate and the dossiers of the mortals who served Robin of Locksley. It was dreary, mind-numbing work, but that didn\u2019t matter. Nothing mattered but protecting the innocent.</p><p>That was what she had been trained to do; that was what sustained her. For their sake, she would lie, steal, and kidnap. For their sake, if she had no other choice, she would kill anyone who tried to stop her.</p><p>Even Will Scarlet, the only man she would ever love.</p><p>A caress scented with violets roused Rebecca of Daven from her slumber. Waning sunlight inched down the bed and away from her skin, replaced by the soothing touch of large, powerful hands. She should have grown accustomed to this by now, so long had they been together, but no, it seemed she never would. Each time she found herself in his arms seemed as great a miracle as the very first.</p><p>When she thought on who they had been, and what had happened to them, perhaps it was.</p><p>\u201cAt last.\u201d A deep voice stirred her hair. \u201cThe lady awakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are mistaken.\u201d Rebecca smiled against the fingertip tracing the bow of her lips, but kept her eyes closed. \u201cThe lady still dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she must talk in her sleep.\u201d A lean cheek grazed her chin, and cool breath whispered against her ear. \u201cDoes she do anything else, I wonder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon she must rise and rouse the other women, break the fast, tend to the animals, begin the washing, clean the south chambers, and finish the carding.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cUnless my lord gives me yet another long list of impossible tasks he wishes me to see to while he plays at being castellan. He delights in such things, you know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHmm. This fellow sounds lazy and uncaring.\u201d He nipped her earlobe and shifted his body to cover hers. \u201cYou would do better to stay here in bed with me, lovely one.\u201d</p><p>The delicious weight of him made Rebecca sigh and slide her arms around his waist. \u201cI want nothing more than that, but I think my husband would have some strong objections.\u201d She opened her eyes and grinned up into the dark, scowling face of the brute on top of her. \u201cOh, Sylas. \u2019Tis you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDevious wench.\u201d He kissed her hard. \u201cFor that I should chain you to this bed for a week.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you promise?\u201d She curled her good leg over his hip, arching against him. \u201cAn entire week?\u201d</p><p>Her husband\u2019s scowl faded as his eyes, black as midnight, took on a faint blue glow. \u201c\u2019Twould not be enough, would it?\u201d</p><p>No, it wouldn\u2019t. Rebecca sometimes wondered if eternity would be. \u201cI love you, Sylas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I you, wife.\u201d</p><p>Shadows stretched over the bed, covering the lovers as time and thought slipped silently from the chamber. Later, when the sun had vanished and the night bedecked itself with the glory of a thousand diamond-bright stars, Rebecca kissed her husband\u2019s damp shoulder and reluctantly untangled herself from his hold.</p> <p>He rolled onto his side so that he might watch her bathe and dress. \u201cYou should take some time for yourself tonight. Have Lettice organize the women. She is in charge of your ladies; she should do something other than gossip with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would, but Tish is besotted with the new armorer come last week from the Realm,\u201d Rebecca told him. \u201cUntil he returns her affections, or sorts out how to discourage them, she will be of little use to any of us.\u201d She remembered something. \u201cOh, that friend of Will\u2019s telephoned. I may have to attend to her tonight as well.\u201d</p><p>His black brows rose. \u201cWhat friend of Will\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>She picked up a small square of stiff paper from her vanity table and read it. \u201cShe calls herself Reese Carmichael. Apparently she is a senior account executive of Peachtree Marketing, Inc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mortal? Coming here?\u201d When she nodded, he sat up. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Her husband disliked strangers coming to Rosethorn for various reasons, not the least of which was preserving their safety. He, Rebecca, and the remainder of the household were Darkyn, immortal beings whose only nourishment was the blood of mortals. Over the centuries the Kyn had learned not to kill for their needs, and had hidden themselves among them, protecting themselves and the human beings upon whom they still depended. Only the Darkyn\u2019s mortal enemies, the Brethren, still pursued them with their single-minded determination. A renegade sect of fanatics who posed as Catholic priests, the Brethren had held as their sole mission for centuries to exterminate the Kyn.</p> <p>Fortunately they had not succeeded, although the secret war between the Darkyn and the Brethren had endured for six centuries. For those reasons, and some their lord paramount had not bothered to explain, Robin of Locksley had chosen to build his stronghold on two thousand acres of land in the sparsely populated Georgia countryside. In the process he had also convinced the few mortals living near Rosethorn\u2019s borders to sell their property to him. Most of his jardin, made up of some five hundred Darkyn who had pledged their service to him, lived at Rosethorn, while the rest managed more than twenty tenant farms surrounding the stronghold on all sides.</p><p>\u201cIt seems Miss Carmichael will be fashioning the new advertisements for the weaponry our lord sells to mortals, and wishes to use our home as something called a \u2018backdrop.\u2019 You needn\u2019t worry. She\u2019s one of the tresori from the city, so she won\u2019t get into any mischief.\u201d Rebecca came over to the bed, lifted her hair, and turned her back toward him. \u201cAre you going back to the city tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, the master has need of me again.\u201d With the deftness of long practice, Sylas fastened the long row of buttons from her waist to her nape.</p><p>As castellan of Rosethorn, Sylas carried duties not limited to supervising the suzerain\u2019s stronghold. The safety of the estate was his primary responsibility, which meant constant monitoring, augmenting, and improving of stores, weapons, and defense measures. Through daily training on the proving ground, he ensured the readiness of the garrison to face any threat, from a full-scale attack by Brethren fanatics bent on destroying the jardin to the intrusion of a curious mortal unaware of their existence. In Robin\u2019s absence, Sylas had complete authority over the jardin as well, and performed in his lord\u2019s stead by hearing grievances, settling disputes, and granting requests.</p><p>Sylas refused to set himself above his men, however, and always took his turn among the suzerain\u2019s personal guard, which required him to occasionally accompany their lord whenever he traveled from Rosethorn to his great house in the city.</p><p>Rebecca understood why he served as both castellan and warrior, and respected him for it, but that didn\u2019t make her like the separation any better. \u201cI wish you didn\u2019t have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor do I,\u201d he said. \u201cOur lord has been strangely restless of late. Will rarely has a moment of peace. Tell me more about this Carmichael woman.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca recalled the brief conversation she had had with Reese. \u201cShe wishes to be shown through the interior of the house so that she might choose the most favorable spots for the photographs needed. She has never been here, and asked if I would take her on a tour of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe told you she wishes to spy upon us? Just like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery curious mortal is not a Brethren agent wishing to destroy us all,\u201d she told him. \u201cTish said something about her once. I think she is Will\u2019s special friend.\u201d</p><p>Sylas grunted. \u201cI will speak to the men anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thank you, but I have already done so.\u201d His indignant look made her chuckle. \u201cYou were busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am castellan. You are chatelaine. The ladies and the household are your charge; the garrison, the weapons, and the fortifications are supposed to be mine.\u201d He thought for a moment. \u201cI will direct Alain to escort you and this mortal while she is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlain will only wish to use her,\u201d Rebecca pointed out.</p><p>\u201cAye, but you may keep him busy fending off anyone else who comes at her.\u201d Sylas\u2019s hand rasped over the short, tight black curls his constant cropping could never quite disguise. \u201cAttend to this special friend of Will\u2019s, but do it quickly, my lady. Strange mortals do not belong at the stronghold. Even those we are told to trust.\u201d</p><p>While he buttoned her gown, Rebecca twisted her light brown hair into a neat coil, which she pinned against the back of her head before she slid two ivory combs on either side of it. She handed him an airy silk snood and sat down on the edge of the bed while he gathered it over her hair and tied the ribbons. \u201cDo you think you are to stay in the city until the morrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis likely.\u201d He kissed the side of her throat. \u201cNo longer than a single night, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Neither of them cared for being apart for longer than a few hours. Rebecca knew it was mostly due to the physical and emotional dependency they had on each other, a rare but enduring bond that had been born when they had risen from the mortal grave where they had been buried together, and walked the night as immortals. When separated from his sygkenis, a Darkyn male became uneasy and short-tempered; he could not rest or find pleasure in anything. If the separation was unwilling or extended, both partners would quickly grow unstable and even dangerous.</p><p>The bond Rebecca shared with Sylas was rather more than one merely of blood. In the last days of their mortal lives they had been two strangers desperately battling to save the innocent. That hopeless struggle had forged a sudden but deep friendship between them. Rebecca loved her husband, but she also respected and trusted him, as he did her. When death had come for her, he had not run away like the others, but stayed with her, holding her hand in his. She had begged him to go, to save himself, but he said that life without her had no interest or meaning for him anymore. He had not let her die alone and afraid, but went with her into the darkness.</p><p>There had been a price for that loyalty, one some might have found heavy or even terrible, but in time they had learned to deal with that, as well as all the other changes that becoming Kyn had wrought.</p><p>Rebecca made her way slowly to the full-length mirror on the other side of the room. She turned this way and that, examining her reflection.</p><p>\u201cWe need a holiday,\u201d Sylas said, coming up behind her. \u201cYou work as hard now as e\u2019er you did for the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoliday comes from the words holy day,\u201d Rebecca reminded him. \u201c\u2019Twas the church that used to give us leave from our duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, so that we might sit and listen to hours and hours of promises of damnation in poorly spoke Latin.\u201d He nipped her ear. \u201cIf you miss it, we could arrange to spend the day in bed watching the Evangelical Channel.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca laughed. Her husband despised television above all modern things. \u201cI think I would trade all my jewels to see you do such a thing. If I had jewels.\u201d</p><p>He turned her around, his expression troubled. \u201cYou do not miss it still, do you?\u201d</p><p>Rebecca\u2019s humor faded a few degrees. She did miss it, her human life. The enjoyment of food, the pleasure of working in the sunlight, the companionship of her friends among the sisters. Few females rose to walk the night; those who belonged to Locksley had been either villeins or gently bred ladies. As chatelaine, she was responsible for them as well, so what friendship she felt toward them was ever tempered by her duty to watch over them.</p><p>But Sylas had lost as much as, if not more than, she. The plague had taken every member of his family, including his beloved younger sister, for whom he had sacrificed so much. That loss had nearly destroyed him.</p><p>\u201cMy only regret in this life and all the others that have been or will be,\u201d she said, winding her arms around his waist, \u201cis that I did not find you sooner.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>Will rose in the early afternoon, tired of staring aimlessly at the ceiling. He\u2019d managed to rest an hour, but thoughts of Reese kept his mind as a dog chasing its tail, ever turning in useless circles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He dressed, collected the day\u2019s mail from the slot in his door, and skimmed through it. Among the various business letters, purchase orders, and reports was a postcard from the county courthouse, stating that Robin Archer was scheduled to appear in court for jury selection in two weeks.</p><p>\u201cNot again.\u201d He crumpled the postcard and made a mental note to speak once more to their human friends in the Atlanta Police Department about permanently removing Rob\u2019s alias from their computers.</p><p>Will walked through the connecting door to the penthouse suite. Immediately he smelled the dark ginger scent of the red-haired mortal from the nightclub whom Robin had brought to his bed. Mild irritation set in as he tracked her path and found that she\u2019d been all over the rooms. He\u2019d have to arrange to have the entire suite cleaned to rid it of her scent.</p> <p>Will didn\u2019t understand why his master had brought the woman here. He\u2019d always preserved the privacy of his city home as a refuge, a place of retreat from the mortal world and the responsibilities of the jardin. Certainly it hadn\u2019t been for convenience\u2019 sake; the rooms they kept reserved for their use at the hotel had been closer.</p><p>At least she\u2019s gone, he thought as he straightened a pillow and moved into the kitchen. He\u2019d been obliged to watch the security cameras until she had left the building, which she had done shortly before dawn.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t see what Robin found so interesting about her. She had been a pretty thing, well dressed and pleasantly mannered, but they hadn\u2019t trailed her to the club for her charms. She possessed a great prize, the book Robin had coveted for centuries, and the only true reason Robin had to trifle with her was to help him obtain it\u2014and yet he had brought her here and used her for his pleasure.</p><p>Surely there would be complications now. With mortal females, there always were.</p><p>Will eased open the door to Robin\u2019s bedchamber, saw the surprising fact that his master was still at rest, and silently gathered the glasses left by the bed table. He took them into the adjoining bath in order to dump the dregs left in them in the sink. He should have persuaded Reese to come to his rooms last night. Even holding her in his arms through the long daylight hours would have greatly improved his rest\u2014and his mood.</p> <p>\u201cWill?\u201d Robin came to stand in the doorway and looked into the room. \u201cWhere is Chris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean the human female from last night? I cannot say, my lord.\u201d Will shut off the taps and dried his hands. \u201cI assume that she returned to her home after she departed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe left?\u201d His master sounded puzzled. \u201cWhen? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Twas near dawn; I secured the elevator after she used it. I saw no car, so I presume she went on foot. I sorted through the mail, and it seems you were summoned for jury duty again. We can hide from mankind for near a millennia, but try as I may I cannot seem to purge your name from the county courthouse mailing list.\u201d Will\u2019s wry frustration faded as soon as he turned and saw his master\u2019s expression. \u201cWhat is wrong? Did something happen with the female?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. No.\u201d Robin walked away.</p><p>Will followed him into the bedchamber, where his master paced around the bed, examining the carpet before he went out to the front rooms. He returned muttering under his breath and disoriented, as if someone had clubbed him over the head.</p> <p>Will set the glasses aside. \u201cRob? Why do you look that way? Did she take something?\u201d</p><p>Robin ignored him, wandering about the room listlessly, as if lost in it.</p><p>Whatever had happened between the mortal and his master, it had not left a favorable impression. Will was just about to inquire of him again when Robin focused on him.</p><p>\u201cHow did she appear to you when she left?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWas she disoriented? Did she seem upset?\u201d</p><p>Will thought back to what he had seen the night before. \u201cI watched her through the security monitors only long enough to assure that she left the building, but she seemed well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was tidily dressed and moved with purpose. She did not weep or drag her steps. She did not take anything, and she did not look back.\u201d Will didn\u2019t like the change in his master\u2019s expression. What the bloody hell had that female done to make him like this? \u201cDid you not send her down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Robin caught a glimpse of something and moved to the bed, taking from the linens a short length of gold chain. He held it as if it were made of copper\u2014the one metal that could wound the Kyn\u2014and yet examined it as closely as if it were fashioned of priceless diamonds. Then, even stranger, he twined it about his fingers like a lock of a woman\u2019s hair. \u201cI never bade her to go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou...\u201d Will stopped as Robin\u2019s meaning sank in. \u201cI do not understand, my lord. You never allow humans to stay the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one I did. Or should have.\u201d Robin put his hand on the bed, smoothing it over the rumpled silk sheets. \u201cI slept with her, and she left me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it was for the best. Had she remained and awoken before you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not understand me,\u201d Robin snarled. \u201cI fell asleep with her. With her in my arms. I slept with that woman and did not wake, did not dream. I slept as I have not since my human lifetime.\u201d The golden chain disappeared inside his fist. \u201cHow could she go like that?\u201d</p><p>He was, Will saw, entirely besotted. Utterly enraged.</p><p>\u201cYou must have compelled her to leave before dawn,\u201d he assured his master. \u201cShe would not have departed herself, not while be spelled.\u201d</p><p>Robin made a contemptuous sound. \u201cI begin to doubt that she was ever under my power.\u201d</p><p>If the female had been impervious to his scent and his charm...\u201cCould she be a Brethren operative?\u201d Will asked. \u201cWe have known them to be resistant to l\u2019attrait. \u2019Tis said they are bred that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would one of those zealots seduce me,\u201d his master countered, \u201cmuch less leave me alone and sleeping in my bed, when she could kill me or have me taken?\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s worry eased. \u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>Robin seemed to notice something, and walked over to the bedside table. He lifted the lamp and removed a small square of paper. He unfolded it slowly and, after staring at it for some time, said, \u201cShe wrote a note.\u201d</p><p>The gingery scent of the woman still radiated from the bed, the strongest concentration of it in the room. Will went over and pulled the coverlet over the sheets to mask some of it. \u201cYou would be wise not to contact her again, my lord. A mortal who cannot be compelled is unpredictable, even dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does not offer me her phone number or contact information,\u201d Robin said in a blank tone. \u201cShe thanks me.\u201d</p><p>Christ Jesus, she\u2019d used him and left. Will almost laughed at the irony of it\u2014Robin had done the same thing to countless mortal females\u2014until he saw the glitter in his master\u2019s eye and instead cleared his throat. \u201cThat was very, ah, polite of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I no one to her, then? Someone she must thank in writing? For what? A mistake she never intends to repeat?\u201d Robin crumpled the paper and tossed it away. \u201cShe used me. A mortal. A mortal used me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stone-hearted bitch.\u201d Will busied himself with tidying the bed pillows. \u201cShall I track her back to her lair and offer her a sternly worded rebuke, my lord?\u201d</p><p>His master kept speaking as if he hadn\u2019t heard him. \u201cShe did not purchase anything at the auction last night, but she did register as a bidder. She would have had to show her identification and give them a credit card. You will go to the auctioneer\u2019s office and obtain whatever information they have for her. I particularly want her full name and where she resides.\u201d He frowned. \u201cShe told me that she recently transferred here from Chicago. Once you have her full name, call Jaus and ask him to run a background check on her.\u201d</p><p>Will often performed background checks on the mortals who did business or came in regular contact with his master; it provided a measure of safety for his lord and sometimes identified potential conflicts before they could happen. But never in all the centuries of serving Robin of Locksley had he investigated one of the females he used for sex. His master\u2019s habits had not changed in seven hundred years: He spent one night with a woman, pleasured her, and then never saw her again. The females he slept with simply didn\u2019t merit any sort of attention from Robin, other than now and then using l\u2019attrait on those who became too spellbound, but only to remove their memories and assure that they would not return to bother him.</p><p>\u201cRob.\u201d He stepped into his path to stop his master\u2019s pacing. \u201cIt was ill-mannered of this mortal to leave in such haste, but her actions are hardly worth so much trouble. Forget this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was not finished with her.\u201d Robin went around him, opened the closet, and ripped a shirt from its hanger, rending a sleeve from it in the process. He tossed the ruined garment aside before taking another.</p><p>The display of anger startled Will; he decided to choose his next words with more care.</p><p>\u201cYou know that women of this time are not like Kyn females. They have much freedom and independence, and they do as they wish. They do not respect men as we expect they should, but that is how things are in this society\u2014\u201d</p><p>Robin turned on him. \u201cWhen have you known me to sleep the day through, from dawn to dusk? With a mortal in my bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so.\u201d Robin pulled on the second shirt. \u201cShe did something to me, this female. I shall learn exactly what it was.\u201d</p><p>He would not allow that the bloody female had simply taken what she wanted and left satisfied. Robin had never dealt very well with resistance or rejection; both reminded him of Marian, the great love of his life, who had neither wanted nor loved him in return.</p><p>\u201cShe could not drug you or exhaust you.\u201d Will collected the torn shirt from the floor. \u201cCould it be that she made you happy?\u201d</p><p>Robin turned on him. \u201cDo I look happy to you now?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot in the least, my lord. Forgive me for suggesting otherwise.\u201d A signal came over the radio Will carried, and he answered it. \u201cWhat is it, Sylas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn Italian lady has arrived to call on our lord,\u201d the other man told him. \u201cShe gives her name as Contessa Salvatora Borgiana.\u201d</p><p>Will glanced at his master, who gave him an impatient nod. \u201cEscort her to the reception room,\u201d he told Sylas. \u201cOur lord will meet with her shortly.\u201d</p> <p>As far as Will was concerned, the interruption could not have been more timely. His master needed to forget this mortal and return his attention to more important matters. With a little luck, he would put her out of his head and forget the indignity she had caused him to suffer.</p><p>He pressed the radio\u2019s call switch before he asked Robin, \u201cWere you expecting the contessa to call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not know she was in America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe may have been driven out of Italy by the Brethren,\u201d Will said. \u201cSo many have, these last months. Shall I prepare rooms for her and her men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSylas and Bergen can attend to her needs.\u201d Robin continued dressing. \u201cYou have work to do. Go. I want to know everything you can learn about this mortal before dawn.\u201d</p> <p>Reese woke to the sound of a mobile phone ringing, and reached blindly until she found it and brought it in front of her burning eyes. The display showed the time\u2014why had Father allowed her to sleep for so long?\u2014and a pet name: Lover boy.</p><p>She switched it on and held it to her ear. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I wake you?\u201d Lover boy had Will Scarlet\u2019s voice.</p><p>He is Will, you idiot. \u201cNo.\u201d She sat up, dragging the sheet to her chin. He couldn\u2019t see her, but she slept naked, and talking to him while she was bare-skinned made her feel exposed. She had to say something, greet him as if nothing had happened.</p><p>Nothing had happened. Yet. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTired. Somewhat annoyed. Very sorry for behaving like such a jackass last night.\u201d Will sounded tentative, as if he were afraid to say more, and then went on. \u201cReese, I want you to know that I never meant\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You can make it up to me when I get to Rosethorn.\u201d She glanced at her watch; she still had enough time to prepare. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is the other reason I called. I can\u2019t meet you there tonight. Rob is attending a gallery show in town, and I must go with him. We will not be returning to the estate until later, likely after midnight.\u201d</p><p>He was telling her everything she needed to know, as if he knew what she intended to do. Did he know? \u201cIt sounds like a great show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could meet us there,\u201d Will suggested. \u201cRob is escorting an old friend, but I will be on my own. We could talk about what happened last night.\u201d When she didn\u2019t reply, he added, \u201cOr perhaps not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to be there,\u201d she lied. \u201cBut it\u2019s the catalog. I have so much work to do on it.\u201d</p><p>He muttered something, and then said, \u201cSo the fact that I forced myself on you has nothing to do with the manner in which you\u2019re now avoiding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. No. It wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d She stopped and rubbed her hand over her face. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that. I\u2019m not avoiding you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it to me, sweetheart.\u201d The rough tone became soft and persuasive. \u201cCome to the show.\u201d</p> <p>Trying to think of another excuse that would not further offend him, give away her true intentions, or jeopardize the mission made her head whirl. \u201cYou\u2019ll be working, and I doubt Lord Locksley wants me distracting you from your duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang Rob,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cCome anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe patient, Will. We can get together later, when we can have more time for ourselves.\u201d She would never see him again. Last night was all that they would ever have, and she\u2019d run from him. It made this farce she was playing out into a cruel form of self-torture. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather be alone with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done nothing but think about that, and you,\u201d he admitted. \u201cAll day, I\u2019ve had no peace. I barely slept. Reese, I know we agreed in the beginning to be friends only, and that neither of us wanted a serious affair. Somehow last night we strayed beyond that, I think.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or scream. She had to know more, though. She couldn\u2019t go through with her mission if she didn\u2019t. \u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I feel?\u201d He laughed. \u201cI want more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore of the same?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore of you.\u201d</p><p>He would have her, in a sense, but he would never know\u2014and that was probably the kindest thing she could ever do for him. \u201cYou may change your mind before the next time you see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She got out of bed. \u201cAs much as I\u2019d love to chat with you, I have to go and get ready for work now. My boss wants me to stop by the office before I drive out to Rosethorn.\u201d She closed her eyes and added a flirtatious lilt to her voice. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will wait for me?\u201d</p><p>Had she ever done anything else? \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>It took Will only a few hours, a quick trip to the auction house, and a number of phone calls to discover that the mortal female who had seduced and then so angered his master was not, in fact, whom she appeared to be.</p><p>The final revelation came down from the Darkyn suzerain of Chicago himself, Valentin Jaus.</p><p>\u201cThis woman has gone to some length to conceal her true identity,\u201d Jaus said after relating what he had discovered about Chris Renshaw. \u201cMy people have been unable to discover any connection she might have with the Brethren, but that, too, is a possibility. Perhaps Robin should consider relocating to the country until your people can deal with her.\u201d</p><p>Will rubbed his eyes. \u201cI do not think the suzerain will be of the same opinion, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would come to provide my aid directly,\u201d Jaus added, \u201cbut I have promised my sygkenis that I will not travel by plane for some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must agree with your lady, my lord.\u201d Will remembered how desperately they had searched for Jaus when his private jet had been hijacked and forced down by a Brethren agent. Robin, who had originally invited Jaus to fly to Atlanta, had blamed himself for the terrifying incident, and had not quit searching until word of Jaus\u2019s rescue had been sent. \u201cI thank you for your assistance with this matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have never repaid your master for sending my grandfather\u2019s sword to me, Will,\u201d Jaus said. \u201cGive Robin my compliments, and please call on me if he has further need.\u201d</p><p>After speaking with Jaus, Will left his office and went to the gallery where Chris Renshaw worked, where he fortunately encountered a mortal who provided him with the reason the woman had created a false identity for herself.</p><p>Chris Renshaw was not an art dealer, but a federal agent.</p><p>Upon his return to the Armstrong building, Will first checked in with the guards. Robin refused to travel with more than a few men, so Will felt obliged to arrange for the most competent, experienced warriors from the jardin to accompany them when they came to the city. He found Sylas and Bergen warily attending to a small group of Italian cavalieri in one of the reception rooms on the first floor.</p><p>\u201cSeneschal.\u201d Sylas came over to him to report. \u201cWe have divided the contessa\u2019s men into small groups and provided them with stores and beds in the barracks.\u201d</p><p>Will scanned the faces of the cavalieri sitting at the table with Bergen. \u201cWhat of these men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are the contessa\u2019s bodyguards. They await their mistress.\u201d The castellan nodded toward the corridor, and Will followed him out of the room. Once out of earshot, Sylas said, \u201cThese Kyn have no lord with them. Only the lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe contessa is a widow, and a recluse,\u201d Will said. \u201cAfter the jardin wars, she would not permit another to take the place of her late husband. It seems she and the master are old friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld friends or not, a woman cannot control more than seventy Kyn males.\u201d</p><p>Will shrugged. \u201cJayr of the Realm has five times that number, and she manages well as suzeraina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but I still cannot like it. \u2019Tis unnatural, the way they look to her.\u201d Sylas paused, searching for words. \u201cWill, I know many have been made to flee the Brethren in Europe, but there is something wrong here. I can feel it.\u201d</p><p>Will trusted his male instincts, but he needed more than a bad feeling. \u201cName what it is, and I will go to our lord with it directly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could.\u201d The big man sighed. \u201cBut no, they conduct themselves as they should, and I have not seen or heard anything that would mark them as a threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have been on duty too often these last weeks,\u201d Will said. \u201cReturn to the estate and your sygkenis. Send Waltham to take your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should send more than one guard, if you mean to accommodate the contessa\u2019s men here,\u201d Sylas said.</p><p>\u201cToo many for town.\u201d Will hadn\u2019t thought about where the contessa and her men would stay while in their territory. Because the cavalieri were not familiar with the United States or the customs of the country, they would need some time and space to adjust and learn how to behave before they were permitted to mingle freely with American mortals. \u201cI expect our lord will send them to Rosethorn. You had best to prepare for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall, as soon as I arrive.\u201d Sylas bowed and strode off down the corridor.</p><p>Will went to the private reception room where Robin was still entertaining the contessa. He stood outside and listened for a break in their conversation before he knocked and went in.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, my lord, my lady.\u201d Will bowed first to the contessa and then to Robin. \u201cI would not intrude, my lord, but an urgent matter has arisen in regard to last night\u2019s business with the mortal female that I must relate to you at once.\u201d He could not say more than that in front of the contessa, and gave her a meaningful look. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe contessa is an old and trusted friend,\u201d his master told him. \u201cYou may speak in front of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to the auction office as you directed, and obtained the information you desired,\u201d he said. \u201cThe female listed a Chicago address that I verified with our friends in the north. If it existed\u2014which it does not\u2014it would occupy the middle of Lake Michigan.\u201d</p><p>Robin didn\u2019t appear impressed by this news. \u201cSomeone must have noted it wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought so as well at first,\u201d Will continued, \u201cbut the driver\u2019s license she provided was not registered with the Chicago Department of Transportation. Also, her credit card was issued by a government-managed credit union in Washington, D.C., but one week ago.\u201d</p><p>Robin\u2019s expression tightened. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt I should go to the gallery to question her employer,\u201d Will said. \u201cIt is closed until the night of the show, but I intercepted one of the humans exiting from the back door\u2014a man named Dennis. Under my influence, he admitted that he did not work for the gallery or any art dealer. He is an electronics expert who specializes in covert monitoring devices. He said that he, the woman, and everyone associated with this show are special agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u201d</p><p>The contessa, who was listening closely, pressed her full red lips together.</p><p>Robin looked as dumbfounded as he had when he discovered the mortal gone from his bedchamber. \u201cShe is an FBI agent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, my lord, and that is not all that the man told me.\u201d Will wished he could soften the blow somehow for his master\u2019s sake, but decided the truth was best. \u201cAgent Renshaw came to Atlanta to work undercover as an art dealer, and set up what they refer to as a \u2018sting operation.\u2019 The FBI wishes to identify and arrest those responsible for transporting to the states the stolen art recovered by the Kyn in France.\u201d</p><p>Robin fell silent for a time, and then said, \u201cI am the one responsible for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d Will became uneasy. \u201cAccording to the man Dennis, the FBI has been interested in your, ah, activities in the art world for some time. The agents have not yet identified you by name or appearance, and they have no witnesses, but they know a great many details about your most, ah, daring exploits. They call you \u2018the Magician.\u2019\u201d</p><p>The contessa produced a tiny laugh. \u201cMost appropriate, my lord, given your skills at making things disappear.\u201d</p><p>Will didn\u2019t care for her fawning or her flattery; it sounded false to his ears. \u201cI do not believe that the female knows that you and the Magician are one and the same,\u201d he told Robin. \u201cIf she did, she surely would have tried to arrest you last night. But she and her cohorts are staging the gallery show specifically as a trap for you. The Maiden\u2019s Book of Hours is being used as the bait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could she know that I wanted that manuscript?\u201d Robin sounded angry now. \u201cFor that matter, how did they know I live here, in Atlanta?\u201d</p> <p>Will moved his shoulders. \u201cI cannot say, my lord, but their information is very good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo good.\u201d Robin rose and walked from one end of the room to the other. \u201cYou are certain that she does not know who I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord, given that your activities date back several decades, the FBI believes you to be an elderly mortal,\u201d Will replied. \u201cEven if Agent Renshaw did suspect, you appear too young and affluent to fit what Dennis called their \u2018profile.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe it.\u201d Robin shook his head slowly. \u201cFirst this mortal treats me like a discarded garment, and now she means to entrap and imprison me.\u201d</p><p>The contessa, who was watching Robin\u2019s face with a singular intensity, spoke then. \u201cIf I may be so bold as to make a suggestion, my lord?\u201d When Robin faced her, she said, \u201cAs I have told you, my talent is persuasion. I could attend this gallery show with you, and easily convince this mortal female to surrender the manuscript to you voluntarily. Would that not be fitting revenge for what she has taken from you?\u201d</p><p>Robin swept his hand to one side. \u201cShe took nothing from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps nothing material, my lord,\u201d the contessa said. \u201cBut your trust has obviously been violated, and by a woman who would gladly do much more harm to you. You are a suzerain; she is but a mortal. If word of this were to spread among our kind...\u201d</p><p>It sounded almost as if she were threatening him, Will thought. It certainly looked as if she were relishing every detail.</p> <p>\u201cNo one need know anything about this,\u201d Will said, glowering at her. \u201cI\u2019m sure such an old and trusted friend as you, my lady, will keep my lord\u2019s confidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can depend on me to be as silent as a mute,\u201d the contessa agreed before she turned to his master. \u201cBut what will you do about this mortal who dares to hunt you, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeach her a lesson,\u201d Robin said flatly. \u201cOne she will not soon forget.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Rosethorn, Ms. Carmichael,\u201d a melodic female voice said. \u201cI hope your journey from the city was a pleasant one.\u201d</p><p>Reese automatically straightened her jacket as she turned and saw the willowy form of a light brown\u2013haired woman standing just inside the sitting room. At first glance Rebecca of Daven appeared angelic, almost radiant, as if her flawless features had been fashioned in some higher place by an unearthly hand. As accustomed as Reese was to the physical beauty of the Darkyn, this slim goddess just might surpass all of them. For a moment she didn\u2019t know whether to offer her hand or go down on her knees.</p><p>As Rebecca came toward her, however, one glaring imperfection made itself known. The goddess had a limp\u2014a bad one. She stepped out with her right leg but dragged the left along the floor, as if she couldn\u2019t bend the knee or use her hip properly. That explained the heavy material of the floor-length skirt of the dress she wore; she was either covering up a cast or a leg brace.</p><p>Chris\u2019s envy dwindled. \u201cVery pleasant, my lady.\u201d She glanced at the nearest love seat. \u201cWould you care to sit down for a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m quite well, thank you. Forgive my ungainliness.\u201d She touched the side of her skirt. \u201cI had the crippling sickness when I was a human child. What do you Americans call that disease?\u201d</p><p>Reese thought for a moment. \u201cI think you mean polio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that is the word for it.\u201d She came a little closer and studied Reese. \u201cYou seem quite young to be in service. I had thought tresori remained in training until their third decade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost do, but a few of us are permitted to begin serving late in the second.\u201d Reese knew she had to change the subject, and quickly. She gestured around the room. \u201cYou run this entire household by yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my ladies to help me, and my husband, Sylas, serves our lord as his castellan,\u201d Rebecca said. \u201cTogether we are able to cope with most of the domestic crises.\u201d She offered an encouraging smile. \u201cWill Scarlet tells me that you have not yet pledged yourself to Lord Locksley. Have you some concern that has not been addressed?\u201d</p><p>Reese seized on that. \u201cI know so little about the suzerain or the estate. When I make my choice, it\u2019s going to be for life, and I\u2019d like to be sure I\u2019ve made the right one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might have talked this over with Will,\u201d the chatelaine chided. \u201cNo one knows Lord Locksley or Rosethorn as well as he.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca had her there. \u201cThere are things you just can\u2019t ask Kyn males. They don\u2019t always understand what\u2019s important to a female tresora. They look at Rosethorn and see a well-guarded Darkyn fortress. I see property that, under certain circumstances, can be seized and searched by the authorities.\u201d Reese nodded toward the painting hanging between two windows: a delicate portrait of a young woman gazing into a mirror. \u201cI know that is a Vermeer. What I don\u2019t know is if it really belongs to Lord Locksley or someone else.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca eyed the painting. \u201cThat once belonged to a mortal who fled to South America from Germany after one of the mortal World Wars. No one knows it still exists.\u201d She frowned. \u201cBut we would never permit the authorities to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless they came during the day, when all of the jardin is at rest,\u201d Reese pointed out. \u201cThen I would have to know whether to hide this painting, or let them admire it while I served them coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I see your meaning.\u201d The chatelaine gave her a look of approval. \u201cI also understand why they let you serve at so young an age. You are a clever and thoughtful young woman, Reese Carmichael. We would be blessed, I think, to count you among our mortal friends.\u201d</p><p>A pity she never would. \u201cThank you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis Rebecca. Come now, I will show you where you might take your photographs.\u201d The chatelaine limped out of the room, and Reese followed her toward the double winding staircase. \u201cI think we should begin with our sewing rooms, where we keep the tapestry work. Our ladies are quite industrious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are as busy as they are beautiful,\u201d a man drawled from behind Reese. \u201cBut they dim before you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Reese smelled something warm and green, like a field of sweet herbs, and glanced over her shoulder at the Kyn male standing there. Like Rebecca, this man had been blessed with extraordinary beauty, although his was more vibrant and earthly. His hair, streaked with all the colors of autumn leaves, hung loose around a face that belonged in an old master\u2019s painting. Dark brows and lashes made his amber brown eyes look like polished gems.</p><p>Tiger eyes, Reese thought, and then remembered. \u201cI doubt that, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am called Alain.\u201d He circled around as he gave her what should have been an insulting personal inspection. \u201cChatelaine, is it my birthday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it is not,\u201d Rebecca said, her soft voice suddenly sharp.</p><p>\u201cHow tragic.\u201d He reached out and fingered a strand of Reese\u2019s hair. \u201cIs it hers?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is Miss Reese Carmichael, sent from the city by Will Scarlet,\u201d Rebecca said. \u201cReese, this is Alain, captain of the garrison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always envied Will\u2019s eye for beauty, Reese, but never so much as at this moment.\u201d He made the single syllable of her name sound like a symphony as he held out his hand. \u201cI am enchanted, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Reese tried to make the handshake brisk, but as soon as their fingers touched his closed around hers, and he breathed in deeply.</p> <p>\u201cAlain.\u201d Rebecca\u2019s tone grew sharp. \u201cMiss Carmichael has come here at Will\u2019s invitation. She is his guest, and I have assured him that she will be treated with every courtesy while she is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d Slowly the cool hand withdrew from Reese\u2019s, but the tiger eyes kept watching her. \u201cMiss Carmichael, have we met before?\u201d</p><p>The chatelaine sighed his name. \u201cAlain, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is only that she seems somehow familiar to me.\u201d He smiled at Reese, transforming his lethal charm into amused resignation. \u201cForgive my poor manners. Welcome to Rosethorn, Miss Carmichael.\u201d</p><p>If she could deceive him, she could do the same with the rest of them. \u201cThank you, my lord. I am very happy to be here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWere you sent to entertain our Italian brothers,\u201d Alain asked, \u201cor do you prefer more civilized lovers?\u201d</p><p>Reese gave Rebecca an uncertain glance. \u201cI\u2019m not here to entertain anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlain, we have no Italians here,\u201d the chatelaine said.</p><p>\u201cWe will as soon as introductions have been made.\u201d He nodded toward the front of the property. \u201cOur lord has sent more than seventy of them from the city to stay with us, and they have just now arrived.\u201d</p><p>When he arrived back at Rosethorn, Sylas had first seen to preparing quarters among the garrison\u2019s barracks for the contessa\u2019s cavalieri. He had meant to go from there to see his wife and warn her about their possible visitors, but a call from Will Scarlet confirmed that the Italians were already en route to the estate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only just arrived myself,\u201d Sylas told the seneschal. \u201cI will need more time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have none,\u201d Will said bluntly. \u201cI am sorry, Sylas, but our lord is not thinking clearly tonight, and I have my hands full with him. Do what you can.\u201d</p><p>Sylas immediately called for his senior men, relayed the situation, and issued orders. \u201cWe are to regard these Italians as guests, but I want the patrols doubled and the interior guards to stand watch day and night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou expect some trouble from them?\u201d Bergen asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Their mistress is an old friend of the master\u2019s.\u201d Sylas looked around him at the sober faces of his best warriors. \u201cRegardless, I expect us to be ready for anything.\u201d</p><p>Word came over the radio a few minutes later from the perimeter guards that several large, chartered passenger vehicles had stopped just beyond the first gate, and that Kyn males walking in presentation formation were approaching the estate. Sylas summoned an equal number from the garrison, ordered them to arm themselves, and sent them to stand ready in the lower courtyard.</p><p>The castellan remained behind long enough to call his wife over the radio. \u201cRebecca, where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am in Ireland, of course,\u201d she called back. \u201cI think I shall visit the high lord and ask him how I might rid myself of a husband too busy to properly greet me when he comes home.\u201d</p><p>Sylas chuckled. \u201cForgive me, my lady; \u2019twas something of an emergency. Have you word of our visitors?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, Alain brought word to me and my ladies. We should have the main hall ready in a few moments. Did you miss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI will show you how much later.\u201d He remembered what she had said earlier. \u201cIs that mortal\u2014Will\u2019s friend\u2014with you? She will have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left her with Alain,\u201d Rebecca said. \u201cShe needed but a few minutes to take photographs of the workrooms, and then he will escort her from the stronghold.\u201d</p><p>Having a strange mortal under their roof at the same time strange Kyn were arriving made Sylas uneasy. Still, he had no time to chase after Reese Carmichael, and Alain would assure that she came to no harm. \u201cVery well. I will see you shortly in the hall.\u201d</p><p>Not for the first time, Sylas was glad of the work he had done to disguise Rosethorn\u2019s fortifications from the ever-curious eyes of the mortal world. Flower beds and turf covered the steep inclines of the curtain walls\u2019 plinth bases. Trees planted along the inside of the lower courtyard cast shade over the subtle crenellations and hoardings where the Kyn on perimeter patrol stood watch. The plaster veneer of the keep, which had been designed to appear as a large contemporary manor house, concealed five-meter-thick masonry walls.</p><p>The decorative casings above the large picture windows housed rolls of steel slats that at the push of a button could be dropped down to form an impenetrable barrier over the glass panes; dual wooden shutters on hidden tracks flanking the windows covered tall, narrow arrow loops. The garages, gardening sheds, generator, and pump houses were actually smaller versions of the old gate towers and were manned by armed guards around the clock. Even the collapsible ramps leading from the lower bailey up to the shield walls had been paved with granite cobblestone and lined with flowering shrubs to appear to the ignorant eye as nothing more than pleasant, well-landscaped walkways.</p><p>Robin had disagreed with his castellan over the need for one last, outmost barrier against invasion. While the modern world had developed formidable means and firepower since the age of castles, water still presented a sizable and difficult obstacle. The suzerain, however, had maintained that nothing could adequately conceal or explain away a wide, water-filled trench encircling the entire property. Sylas had to be content with a series of retention ponds and ditches for which he fashioned collapsible borders and a massive underground system of supply pipes. Should the stronghold come under attack, he could flip a switch and flood the ditches within minutes, creating an almost instantaneous moat.</p><p>Knowing the stronghold was well guarded did not relieve all of Sylas\u2019s misgivings about their unexpected visitors. If the Brethren had tracked the Italians after they had fled Venice, they might have followed them across the sea to America. Hopefully their mistress had been too clever to lead their mutual enemy directly to Robin of Locksley\u2019s door.</p><p>Sylas led his personal escort down the ramp to where the Italians were waiting. Their leader, a tall warrior whose dark face gave away none of his thoughts, stepped forward and performed a respectful bow.</p><p>\u201cI am Saetta, mar\u00e9chal to Contessa Salvatora Borgiana, sent here by leave of your suzerain, Robin of Locksley.\u201d He straightened and met Sylas\u2019s gaze with the steadiness of an experienced leader. \u201cWe are grateful for the sanctuary you provide.\u201d</p><p>As castellan, Sylas had considerably more rank than Saetta, whose position in Italy was roughly equal to that of a head groom or stablemaster. Under any other circumstances it would be an insult to have such a member of the contessa\u2019s household act as her liaison. Still, Sylas knew that Salvatora Borgiana and her jardin had been without proper leadership since the death of her lord paramount and husband, Arno, during the jardin wars. That Richard had permitted the situation to persist for so long puzzled him, but was not a matter for him to question or challenge.</p><p>\u201cSylas of Daven, Lord Locksley\u2019s castellan.\u201d He walked forward a few steps, eliminating most of the space between them before returning the bow. Among the Kyn, it was a gesture of confidence as well as a silent offer of friendship. \u201cYou and your men are welcome here, mar\u00e9chal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will endeavor not to create any hardship for you or your men, castellan.\u201d Saetta turned and introduced his most senior men, who exchanged the proper greetings while keeping a wary eye on the battlement patrols watching them from above.</p><p>All of them, Sylas noticed, had old, faint marks on their faces, hands, or arms that he recognized as burn scars. It was not unusual for Kyn to suffer scarification from fire\u2014burns healed slowly, and the flesh always retained some mark from it\u2014but he had never seen so many afflicted.</p><p>Once Sylas had accomplished his turn at introductions, Saetta gestured toward the front gates. \u201cWhat weapons we managed to bring with us from Italy are stowed on our transport vehicles. I have allowed my men to retain their daggers for personal protection. I ask your permission to permit them to continue to carry them during our stay at Rosethorn.\u201d</p><p>Seventy men armed with daggers could inflict a great deal of damage. \u201cYou are under no threat here,\u201d Sylas pointed out.</p><p>\u201cTrue, but to strip a man of all his blades after he\u2019s been driven from his homeland and obliged to seek shelter in a strange country, among those who are not blood Kyn...\u201d Saetta made a subtle gesture. \u201cIt is a matter of personal dignity.\u201d</p><p>He would not beg for his men, Sylas thought, but nor would he see them suffer unnecessarily. His respect for Saetta rose another notch.</p><p>\u201cIt took me fifty years to grow accustomed to not wearing a sword outside our territory. As long as your men conduct themselves appropriately, I will allow it.\u201d He raised his voice a degree. \u201cAll of the mortals who serve at Rosethorn are tresori, and are to be treated as such. Females are given the right of choice, and the right of refusal. All Kyn women here have been claimed or are bonded.\u201d He expected to hear a few soft groans, but none of the cavalieri made a sound. \u201cWe will see to your needs. Rosethorn has ample stores, and I will arrange to provide you with transportation at regular intervals to territory where you may hunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour generosity will not be forgotten.\u201d Saetta turned and issued an order in Italian, repeating it in English. \u201cWe are among friends here. You are to speak in their tongue and respect their customs. If you do not know, ask and you shall be told.\u201d</p><p>The men responded in silent unison by each going down on one knee and crossing an arm over his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou are welcome here,\u201d Sylas said. \u201cNow come\u2014come and meet your American Kyn.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The hard line of Saetta\u2019s mouth finally eased. \u201cI have thought of little else since getting off that cursed boat.\u201d</p><p>Once he had led the Italians to the main hall, Sylas kept watch over the two groups as they came together. Rosethorn had many Kyn visitors over the course of the year, but never had so many of their kind descended at once. He felt proud as he watched his men greet Saetta\u2019s and separate them into smaller groups. The ladies appeared with bottles of blood wine and goblets, offering their smiles as they served the cavalieri. Saetta accepted a goblet but remained at Sylas\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cThe one with the golden brown hair and the face of a Madonna,\u201d the mar\u00e9chal said, nodding in her direction. \u201cShe is yours?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, that is my wife.\u201d Sylas eyed him. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer smile changes when she looks upon you. There, now.\u201d He gestured with his goblet as Rebecca smiled across the room at Sylas. \u201cShe is lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is.\u201d Sylas didn\u2019t like other men complimenting his wife, or even looking at her\u2014such was the price of their bond. \u201cThe first time a Kyn male admired her in my presence, I believe I threatened to rip his head from his neck.\u201d He glanced at the Italian. \u201cI think I have mellowed in my old age. Now I only wish to tear out his tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He nodded. \u201cShe is sygkenis as well as wife.\u201d</p><p>Sylas asked Saetta about his journey from Italy, and as they discussed the perpetual hazards of travelling among mortals, the mar\u00e9chal seemed to relax, enough to make Sylas turn the conversation to more delicate matters.</p> <p>\u201cYour men are too few to make a proper jardin, and too many to join another,\u201d Sylas said. \u201cHow did your mistress prevent them from abandoning her to become rogues?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter our suzerain was killed in battle, and our lady refused to accept another in his place, some of the men spoke of leaving Venice. Those of us with wives and blood Kyn needed more protection, and considered pledging ourselves to another lord paramount.\u201d Saetta\u2019s tone grew distant as he gazed out at the assembly. \u201cI think we would have, if not for the fire.\u201d</p><p>Fire had always been a threat to the Kyn, as being burned was one of the few ways they could be killed. \u201cWas it a Brethren attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf a kind.\u201d All expression left the mar\u00e9chal\u2019s countenance. \u201cOur women kept their faith better than we did. They still attended services together in our lord\u2019s chapel several days each week. After the jardin wars, they decided among themselves to secretly install a priest. They thought they could control him. They discovered they were wrong when he trapped them inside the chapel and set fire to it.\u201d</p><p>Sylas looked at the faint burn scars on the men\u2019s faces and limbs. \u201cThe men tried to rescue them.\u201d</p><p>Saetta inclined his head. \u201cWe lost eighteen that day, but none of the women survived. My wife, Francesca, and our daughter, Mariposa, were among them. Then there were the suicides. Another five.\u201d He paused, removing his gloves to reveal strong hands and forearms, every inch covered in faint but visible burn scars. \u201cI should have been the sixth, but for the contessa. She tended our wounds herself, never resting, never leaving us until we had healed. She promised us that she would make our lives worth living again. She saved all of us.\u201d</p> <p>Sylas tried to imagine surviving Rebecca. He couldn\u2019t think of his life without her in it. \u201cForgive me for reminding you of your loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did not know.\u201d The Italian looked out over the assembly. \u201cWe pledged our lives in service to our lord, and our loyalty to him never wavered once. But I tell you this: Every man here would gladly die for our lady.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>Reese felt Alain watching her as she snapped a few more shots of the tapestries hanging from the work frames. \u201cI\u2019m almost done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are depressingly industrious,\u201d he informed her. \u201cAre you quite certain you do not wish to see my chambers? I have many things there that might please your eye. The furnishings are especially fine, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flattered, but as Rebecca said, I have to leave soon.\u201d Reese moved to another angle, one that brought her closer to Alain. \u201cYou\u2019re not English, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I was Irish in my human life. A traveling minstrel with more hot blood than cool sense.\u201d He came to stand beside her and looked down at her intently. \u201cDamn me, lady, but I swear I know you.\u201d</p><p>Reese shut off her camera and tucked it into her purse. \u201cPerhaps we met once in the city.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think not. It is not your face, pretty as it is. It is your scent. I never forget a woman\u2019s sweetness, and yours...\u201d He bent his head and breathed in. \u201c\u2019Tis like something in the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA field of berries at moonrise,\u201d she finished for him.</p><p>\u201cYes. Exactly.\u201d He straightened. \u201cHow did you know what I was thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d She put her closed hand on his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s what you said the first time we met.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a broad grin. \u201cI knew it. When\u2014\u201d He stopped and glanced down at the sharp-ended pressure cartridge sticking out of his shirt. Then his clouding eyes met hers. \u201cWhy do you this, girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave,\u201d she told him. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cI know you now. You came at night. You brought me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She caught him as he staggered and held him until he sagged. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>It took a few minutes to take what she needed from Alain before she secured him where he would not be immediately found. Once Reese had seen to that, she checked the hall and then left the workrooms. The timing of the Italians\u2019 arrival could not have worked out better for her; all she needed to do now was conceal herself in the lord\u2019s chamber and wait for him to come to her.</p><p>Robin of Locksley occupied the largest suite of rooms at Rosethorn, but the furnishings were unexpectedly plain and the decor uncluttered. A great many plants and small trees had been brought in, enough to make a visitor mistake the chamber for a tidy greenhouse. Among the beauties of nature Reese noted a number of incredibly old artworks, carvings, and tapestries, all dating back to the time when Locksley had been human. He could not return to that forgotten world, Reese thought, but he surrounded himself with constant reminders of it.</p><p>She opened a door to another set of rooms, smaller and much less cluttered, and switched on the lights. She knew they belonged to Will from his scent, as dark and rich as bittersweet chocolate, which still lingered in the air.</p><p>Instead of the expected red, Robin\u2019s seneschal had chosen the blue of ice crystals, the paleness of cream, and a blue-tinged onyx for his colors. Shades of winter, she thought as she wandered about, touching the surface of the old black oak desk where he had neatly sorted piles of estate paperwork and letters.</p><p>She picked up a pretty fountain pen, the barrel made of an ivory-streaked dark blue, and removed the end cap. He\u2019d used it so often that he\u2019d worn down one side of the golden nib. \u201cWho taught you to write?\u201d she asked under her breath.</p><p>Silence gave her no answer.</p><p>She replaced the pen where she had found it, and glanced over at the bed. It was large and placed close to the fire, and she could almost see him sleeping there, warm and safe, dreaming of some adventure with Robin, smiling a little as he remembered those happy times.</p><p>Did he ever dream of the nights in Aubury? she wondered. Or had he forgotten?</p><p>Her pocket buzzed against her hip, making her jump. With a shaking hand she took out her phone, expecting to see her father\u2019s number on the screen.</p><p>But no, it was her Lover boy.</p><p>She stared at it for a long moment, and then flipped it open. \u201cHello, Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are doubtless furious for being made to leave the house,\u201d he said, all in a rush, \u201cbut let me explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI know the protocol involved with visiting Kyn. Get all the un pledged mortals out of the house, and then break out the bagged blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound hoarse. Are you ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy throat is a little sore.\u201d She looked around her. \u201cI had thought you\u2019d do your rooms in red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been to my chamber?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m standing in them right now. \u201cRebecca was kind enough to show them to me. You need a new fountain pen.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cA pity you cannot sneak back into Rosethorn tonight. I would very much like to see you in my rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t left the house yet. Maybe...Hold on.\u201d Reese heard shouts from the hallway and crossed the room to listen at the door. She opened it a bare inch to peer outside, and saw one of the guards collapse a few feet away. The dark-haired warrior standing over him held a dart gun, and paused long enough to reload it with two cartridges filled with blue liquid before hurrying off.</p><p>\u201cReese?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard something.\u201d Reese carefully closed the door and ran for the bag she had left on the desk. She searched through it until she found the small cigarette case at the bottom. Her hands shook as she opened it.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot stay at Rosethorn,\u201d Will said. \u201cCome to the gallery show. I\u2019ll ask Rob to give me a few hours for myself. We can go dancing.\u201d</p><p>She removed one of the thin glass vials from the case. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can do that, Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? With the Italians there, you cannot stay to do your work. What else have you to do but sleep?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him until she had swallowed the contents of the vial and replaced the case. \u201cI\u2019ll call you when I get out of here.\u201d She closed her eyes and gritted her teeth against the pain.</p><p>\u201cI will be waiting for your call,\u201d he warned. \u201cUntil then, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Will.\u201d Reese ended the call and started for the door when three men brandishing tranquilizer guns came into the room. She threw the phone at them and ran, but two of them caught her before she could escape and pinned her between them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe is no threat to us,\u201d the burly one holding her left arm said in Italian. \u201cOnly another of their mortal servants.\u201d</p><p>The third, a tall, lean man with sad eyes, nodded. \u201cTake her down to the tunnels and lock her in the dungeons with the others.\u201d</p><p>At the downtown gallery, Will parked the car where it would be easily accessible\u2014long experience serving as Robin\u2019s second had taught him to always prepare for a hasty departure\u2014before he opened the rear door and helped the contessa out.</p> <p>\u201cGrazie, seneschal.\u201d She shook out her skirt, spreading the scent of marigolds around her before she surveyed the gallery building. \u201cAre you sure this is the place? It looks too small.\u201d</p><p>Will didn\u2019t like Salvatora Borgiana or her aura of lazy contempt. So far tonight she had complained about the weather, which she considered too humid, the mortals in the city, whom she decided overcrowded it, and even the limousine ride from Robin\u2019s building, which she felt had taken too long. She might be a refugee seeking sanctuary, but she conducted herself like a disgruntled queen among peasants.</p><p>You were a peasant, he reminded himself. \u201cI shall go in first and scout the premises,\u201d he told his master.</p><p>\u201cThat will not be necessary.\u201d Robin took Salvatora\u2019s arm, but he had eyes only for the gallery. \u201cCheck their security measures and then report back to me inside.\u201d</p><p>Will almost refused\u2014he took his duty to keep Robin safe very seriously\u2014but then saw the glitter of copper in his master\u2019s eyes. \u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p> <p>A quick and quiet reconnoiter of the building revealed the federal agents strategically posted at the front and back entrances as well as the roof. He noted that the windows and doors had also been wired with sensors, doubtless connected to a monitoring station inside. The mortal authorities had fashioned the entire building into a trap, but their crude methods were no match for Robin of Locksley.</p><p>Once he felt satisfied, Will went inside the gallery and looked for Robin. He spotted him with the contessa, but saw no sign of Chris Renshaw.</p><p>\u201cThat scowl on your face makes me think the woman with the titian locks is your Agent Renshaw,\u201d Salvatora was saying to him. \u201cShe was staring at you just before she scurried off to hide.\u201d</p><p>Will was tempted to join them, but decided to watch from a distance. Robin guided his companion away from an eager young girl who had inexplicably dyed her short, spiky hair a glowing shade of pink, and accompanied her to a pedestal case set somewhat apart from the other exhibited artworks.</p><p>He had never seen The Maiden\u2019s Book of Hours, but the ancient manuscript inside the glass case atop the pedestal seemed to match the description Robin had given him. It seemed the thing his master had coveted for so many centuries was finally to be his. The odd thing was, once standing before it, Robin barely spared it a single glance. His gaze, bright with hostility, kept straying toward the closed door to the manager\u2019s office on the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cDid we come here for the book, or for her?\u201d Will muttered.</p> <p>Will moved toward an unoccupied corner, where he stood with his back to the walls and kept watch over his master and the contessa as well as the crowd of mortals surrounding them. Standing guard was, for the most part, boring work, but he usually had no difficulty keeping his mind on his duties. Nor would he have tonight, if not for the call he\u2019d made to Reese from the car.</p><p>He wondered why her voice had sounded so strained. She\u2019d made the excuse of a sore throat, which must have pained her greatly, for when she had first started speaking she\u2019d sounded like a man. But under the hoarseness he\u2019d heard something else\u2014sadness, or perhaps loneliness\u2014exactly as he had before, when they\u2019d met in the club. It made little sense to him, for Reese had always been a happy, energetic woman. It had been the first thing that had drawn him to her.</p><p>No, there was more to it than that. Will rarely got involved with mortal women, but from the first time Reese had come to his master\u2019s city home, she had made her attraction to him quite transparent. Accustomed to females being immediately drawn to his master, Will had felt both startled and flattered by her attention. He didn\u2019t mind standing in Robin of Locksley\u2019s shadow, but it had been quite pleasing to step out of it for once.</p><p>All of that had changed since last night. Something had happened to Reese, perhaps, something that had persuaded her to think differently of him. But Will would swear that she still cared, even more so than in past. He had felt it in her looks. He had heard it in her voice. It had called forth the same response from him.</p><p>He dragged his thoughts back to the present as he saw Robin abandon the contessa and stalk across the room and force his way into the manager\u2019s office. Suppressing a groan, he went after him.</p><p>By the time Will reached the door, Robin had closed it and jammed the knob. Will had no choice but to stand outside and listen.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t notice you coming in,\u201d he heard Chris Renshaw say.</p><p>Robin\u2019s response was quick and vicious. \u201cYou are a better liar than that, madam.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, Rob. I have to get back to the show.\u201d Her footsteps came toward the door. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Robin snapped. \u201cI do not excuse you.\u201d</p><p>Will put a hand on the knob. He knew his lord was greatly put out by how Chris Renshaw had used and deceived him, but she was still a mortal. In his anger, Robin might forget that.</p><p>\u201cI know you saw me,\u201d his master continued. \u201cWhy did you not come to me?\u201d</p><p>The female\u2019s light footsteps retreated from the door. \u201cAll right, I did catch a glimpse of you and your companion when one of the press asked me about you. I didn\u2019t come over because I felt awkward about approaching you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwkward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to say anything that might embarrass you in front of your date.\u201d Chris\u2019s voice paused for a long moment. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be rude. Again, I apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were protecting me. I see.\u201d Heavier footsteps moved across the room. \u201cTell me, what did you think would embarrass me most? That you might slip up and mention that you used me for sex? Or perhaps that you never told me your full name? Or that you left my bed this morning without bothering to wake me or say farewell?\u201d</p><p>Will winced.</p><p>\u201cI wrote you a note\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, yes, how could I forget? The effusive, affectionate, one-line note of thanks.\u201d Like Chris\u2019s, Robin\u2019s voice came from the back of the office now. \u201cI\u2019ve not earned such an unstinting amount of gratitude since the last time I held a door open for an elderly woman using a cane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobin. That is my name. Say it. Say all of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobin.\u201d Chris\u2019s voice grew so soft Will could barely make out her next words. \u201cListen. I\u2019ve never done anything like that, and I really didn\u2019t know what to do except leave. I told you, I don\u2019t pick up guys in bars. I don\u2019t have one-night stands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere, now, that has a ring of truth to it.\u201d His master\u2019s tone changed as well, and became deceptively soft. \u201cBut technically speaking, I wasn\u2019t a one-night stand, was I? You didn\u2019t stay the night. By my calculations, love, you owe me two more hours. I\u2019d like to collect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d the young woman with the pink hair said as she appeared before Will. She eyed the door. \u201cIs there something going on in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to concern us.\u201d Will guided her away from the office and into the short hall beyond it, where he deliberately shed some scent. When her pupils expanded, he said, \u201cLeave the gallery and return to your home. Think no more of this night.\u201d He glanced at her vivid locks. \u201cAnd please stop putting that color in your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave. Forget. Color.\u201d She nodded vaguely and wandered off toward the front entrance.</p><p>Will resumed his listening post in time to hear Chris say, \u201cSomeone is going to come looking for me any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet them try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobin.\u201d Garments rustled. \u201cPlease stop.\u201d</p><p>His master\u2019s next words came as tentative as the hurt coloring them. \u201cDid it truly mean nothing to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it started out that way,\u201d Chris told him, \u201cbut when I woke up and saw you sleeping next to me, and remembered...I didn\u2019t know I would feel like that.\u201d She hesitated before she added, \u201cI didn\u2019t even think about you, not really. I got dressed as fast as I could, and I ran.\u201d</p><p>Will understood her actions then. She hadn\u2019t used Robin and left him. She\u2019d fallen in love with him, and run.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t regret being with me,\u201d his master said, sounding appalled. \u201cNot how we were together.\u201d When the woman didn\u2019t answer him, he said, \u201cChris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her voice went too low for Will to hear as she murmured to his master, but he felt a wave of relief. Now that she had explained, surely it would dispel Rob\u2019s anger.</p><p>\u201cIf that is true,\u201d Robin said, \u201cwhy did you run away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you ever done something amazing and dangerous and exciting,\u201d she asked him, \u201cthat you later wished you\u2019d never done at all? Because you know it could change everything you have, everything you are?\u201d</p><p>Reese, Will thought, awash in his own regret. If he had let her go two months ago, when he had first sensed that their affair might be coming to its conclusion, she might now be happy. Was that it? Had he held on to her too long?</p><p>\u201cSo you ran away because you wanted more.\u201d Robin uttered a bitter laugh. \u201cYes, actually, I have done that myself. I believe this is where my severely bruised pride takes a tumble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not you. It\u2019s me. My life. My choices.\u201d Chris sounded better now, more sure of herself. \u201cI am glad you understand. I\u2019ll never forget you, or the night we spent together.\u201d</p><p>The bluntness of her rejection made Will rub his eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBefore you send me on my way,\u201d Robin told her, \u201cand go back to living your life as it was, there is something else I want you to remember.\u201d</p><p>The sounds of their embrace compelled Will to reach for the knob again, until another idea occurred to him. As angry as he was, Robin would not disgrace himself in front of his old friend. Will looked across the gallery for the contessa, but she no longer stood by the book. Frowning, he walked away from the office and turned, searching the crowd for her.</p><p>A painfully loud screech shattered the air, and icy water showered down over Will, drenching him. As the patrons screamed, his head snapped up to see the streams of water spraying from the overhead metal spout in the ceiling. He blocked the spray from his face with his hand and noticed that every other ceiling spout had activated, and then he felt an icy sensation pass over him.</p> <p>Across the room, glass shattered.</p><p>Frost bloomed over his sodden garments as the cold sank deep and burned against his flesh. Then he couldn\u2019t feel his hand, and looked up to see it encased in a spray-shaped sheath of ice. At the same time, the streams of water pouring down instantly froze all around him, crackling as they formed thick bars. The same happened around the gallery, until every one of the patrons had been trapped in a frozen cage.</p><p>Only one Kyn had the talent to turn water to ice in a heartbeat\u2014his master\u2019s oldest enemy, Guy of Guisbourne.</p><p>Will wrenched his hand free of the ice block and kicked his way out of the trap, drawing his dagger as he whirled, looking for the hateful visage of the dark lord. He saw no sign of him, but soon found the source of the shattering sound. The pedestal case in which The Maiden\u2019s Book of Hours had been displayed now stood empty, the glass smashed by a powerful hand.</p><p>Will made the rounds of the rooms. When he felt sure the rogue was not inside the gallery, he intercepted Robin and the mortal woman as they hurried out of the office.</p> <p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Will said, \u201c\u2019twas done by Kyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy one Kyn.\u201d Hatred made Robin\u2019s voice harsh. \u201cThis is Guisbourne\u2019s work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Chris looked from Robin to Will and back again. \u201cWho\u2019s Guisbourne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not see his face. He set off the water system somehow, and used talent to freeze the streams.\u201d Will felt like a fool. \u201cOnce the mortals and I were trapped, he smashed the case and helped himself to the book.\u201d</p><p>Robin surveyed the room in disgust.</p><p>\u201cCyprien banished him at the winter tournament.\u201d Will shook his head. \u201cTo defy the seigneur\u2019s order of exile would be signing his own death warrant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe has nothing left to go to, Will,\u201d Robin said. \u201cHis seneschal is dead, his Saracens deserted him, and his jardin was burned out. All he has left is his vengeance.\u201d</p><p>Will couldn\u2019t understand it. \u201cWhy would he do this instead of challenging you directly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows I would kill him.\u201d Robin moved to the ruined case and put his hand on the empty velvet base inside. \u201cThis is more personal than a duel. He could not have her in life, so he would keep from me the only likeness of her that exists.\u201d He drew his hand away and curled it into a fist. \u201cTrack him. Now.\u201d</p><p>Will moved around the gallery until he picked up the dark lord\u2019s scent, which led from the case to a side door. Here he had stood watching, Will realized from the heavy odor of aniseed.</p><p>The bastard had actually taken a moment to stop and gloat over his work.</p><p>He went outside, a dagger in his hand, silently praying to find Guisbourne still near. This time he would finish the work the dark lord\u2019s seneschal had begun at the Realm, and deliver his head to his master.</p><p>But the scent trail led him only to a deserted alley between the gallery and a neighboring building, where it abruptly vanished. Will knew only one way Guisbourne could have managed that. Frustrated, he turned his attention to the problem at hand\u2014the mortals caught in the attack. He took a moment to disconnect the landlines at the terminal box outside the gallery before returning inside.</p><p>\u201cGuisbourne\u2019s scent disappeared in the street outside,\u201d he reported to his master. \u201cHe must have used a car to escape.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you disable the telephone lines?\u201d When Will nodded, Robin\u2019s tight expression eased.</p><p>\u201cContact the jardin. We will need a dozen men here while we clean up this mess and attend to the humans. Alert our friends at the police department as well.\u201d</p><p>Will turned and found himself enveloped by the fragrance of marigolds, and facing the contessa and four armed guards.</p><p>\u201cI regret to say that your men cannot come to your aid, my lord,\u201d Salvatora Borgiana said with a beguiling smile.</p><p>Robin studied her face. \u201cYou were a part of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intended only to take the manuscript from you,\u201d she told him. \u201cUnfortunately, it seems that Nottingham had a better plan than I.\u201d</p><p>Robin\u2019s voice grew cold. \u201cWhy do you want the book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy family bought it from Nottingham when he came to settle in Italy. My father made a gift of it to my younger sister, Beatrice, when she took her vows. \u2019Twas the only earthly possession she ever treasured, and upon her death it was supposed to come to me.\u201d Some of the smirk left the contessa\u2019s face, and for a moment she looked as enraged as Will felt. \u201cI have waited seven hundred years for this night.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t impress his master. \u201cObviously, my lady, you will have to wait a little longer. Now, if you will permit me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have just sent word to all of my warriors to capture your men and take control of your stronghold,\u201d the contessa said. \u201cI have also secured your mortal female\u2019s partner as another hostage. You will find Nottingham, retrieve the manuscript, and bring it back to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not command me, madam.\u201d Robin glanced at her men. \u201cIf you wish to hunt down my cousin, send your own men after him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy men have other responsibilities.\u201d Salvatora swept her hand in an elegant motion, and her guards drew their copper swords. \u201cIt should be no trouble for you to retrieve the book. But if you need more reason to pursue Nottingham, consider the lives of all the Kyn and humans under your rule. One call from me, and my men will begin executing them, twenty at a time.\u201d</p><p>Reese was still at Rosethorn. Will\u2019s scent sharpened, and his fangs sprang into his mouth.</p><p>His master\u2019s eyes turned to pure copper. \u201cI thought you named me your friend, Salvatora.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman can have no friends in this world, my lord. Not if she wishes to survive.\u201d She flipped a hand toward Will. \u201cYou may have your seneschal verify that I speak the truth, if you like.\u201d</p><p>Robin gave Will a nod. He walked away a short distance before he took out his mobile phone and called the estate.</p><p>An unfamiliar voice answered the call. \u201cName yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Will Scarlet, seneschal to Suzerain Locksley,\u201d he said. \u201cYour mistress has given me leave to speak to one of my men. Put Sylas on the line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will wait.\u201d</p><p>During the interval of silence that followed, Will tried not to think of Reese, captured and helpless, at the mercy of invading Kyn. He knew her training included how to protect herself during such clashes between his kind; she would do as she had been taught. The fact that she was mortal was some measure of protection in itself. The Italians needed human blood to survive, and they wouldn\u2019t be quick to destroy their only sustainable source of it.</p><p>Will\u2019s thoughts darkened. Reese was his woman. Whatever the outcome, whatever devil\u2019s bargain his master struck with the contessa, he would hunt down and gut any Kyn male who had laid a hand on his lover.</p><p>\u201cThis is Sylas of Daven,\u201d a harsh voice said.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis Will,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me what you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe contessa\u2019s cavalieri attacked us during the welcome gathering,\u201d Sylas said. \u201cWe engaged them, but they brought out strange pistols that shoot darts of blue liquid. I do not know what it is, but every Kyn they shot fell senseless and unmoving.\u201d</p><p>Will reined in his temper. \u201cIt is a sleeping potion discovered by Lady Alexandra, Cyprien\u2019s sygkenis. It will not harm them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Italians spread through the stronghold from the main hall, and did the same to the interior guards and household staff. Once they secured the house, they sent out detachments to deal with the patrols.\u201d</p><p>Whoever had orchestrated this had known exactly what they were doing. \u201cHow many have fallen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll but me,\u201d Sylas said. \u201cThe entire garrison has been imprisoned in the tunnels below. I was kept awake to speak with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what you can,\u201d Will said. \u201cWe will come for you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, seneschal, I shall. Give my love to Rebecca when next you see her.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca of Daven never left Rosethorn. By giving him the message, Sylas was telling him that Rebecca had managed to escape. Will had no doubt that the chatelaine had also taken many or all of her ladies with her. \u201cI shall.\u201d</p><p>Someone snapped something in Italian, and the line went dead.</p><p>Will returned to Robin. \u201cThey permitted Sylas to speak to me, my lord. It is as she says. Her men have captured the jardin and are holding all of our people in the underground tunnels.\u201d He looked around for the contessa and her men, but saw they had departed.</p><p>The sound of approaching sirens distracted Robin.</p><p>\u201cThe police.\u201d He cursed under his breath in the old tongue, eyeing Chris before he gave Will a meaningful look.</p><p>His master didn\u2019t have to tell him that before they could rescue their Kyn, they would have to first deal with the humans.</p><p>Rebecca inched along the narrow passage. The walls scraped her shoulders and her breasts, but she knew she was close. Behind her, the women she had led into the impossibly narrow gap also made their way through it, each blindly following her.</p><p>At last the wall space widened, becoming a small chamber outside a barred door. Rebecca listened as her ladies crowded in behind her, and then lifted the heavy plank of wood. Carefully she eased the door open and stepped out into darkness, breathing in the air until she felt sure no other occupied the immediate area. She turned back and gestured for the women to come out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy lady, there is blood on your gown.\u201d Lettice touched the red-stained slash in the material over her left side.</p><p>Rebecca covered it with her hand. \u201c\u2019Tis nothing.\u201d She gazed at the other women. \u201cWe will take a moment to collect ourselves and then we will enter the tunnel. Keep watch, and be as quiet as you can while we are here.\u201d</p><p>She moved a short distance away from her ladies before she checked her side. The Italians had rapidly emptied their guns during the attack in the main hall, and the one who had chased them had made quick use of his sword when she blocked him from following the women into the baths. Fortunately none of her ladies had seen her response, and she had left the body in the heated pool, where the water turned pink as it erased the most telling indication of her attack: the blood that had poured from his eyes, nose, mouth, and ears.</p> <p>She would not think about him anymore. She couldn\u2019t, or she would surely do it again.</p><p>Drawing on the talent she shared with Sylas, Rebecca closed her eyes and sent out her heart to seek his. She found he had escaped to their bedchamber and had barricaded himself within.</p><p>\u201cThe Italians have taken over,\u201d Sylas said out loud in the empty room as he felt her heart join with his. Through his eyes, she watched him lock the door and go to the weapons cabinet. \u201cWhere are the women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith me on the third level, outside the escape tunnel.\u201d Rebecca lowered her voice. \u201cCan you come to us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He strapped on his chest protector before choosing a helm. \u201cYou must go without me. Warn the suzerain as soon as you are safe.\u201d</p> <p>Now she understood why he was donning his armor. \u201cYou cannot fight so many, Sylas. Not alone.\u201d When he didn\u2019t reply she felt dizzy. \u201cYou have to surrender to them. Talk to them. They must want something.\u201d</p><p>He pulled on his gauntlets. \u201cI do not negotiate with cowards who attack women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must.\u201d She closed her eyes for a moment, but that only made the dizziness worse. \u201cElse they will take my life with yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It need not be so.\u201d Sylas turned his head as something heavy began hammering on the outside of the chamber door. He concentrated until he could see through her eyes. The darkness of the subbasement and the frightened faces of the other women swam inside his head. \u201cYou are stronger than that, Rebecca.\u201d</p><p>Her voice dropped low. \u201cI am nothing without you.\u201d</p><p>It was harder for her to feel his emotions when distance separated them, but sometimes the strongest came through their heart bond. She felt the tightening of his chest as regret filled his heart. She tasted the sweat on his lip as fear and rage fought for dominion over his head. Finally the love he felt for her, the love that had saved them both so many times, conquered the ugliness. As the door to the chamber began to give way, he calmed and put his swords back in the cabinet.</p> <p>\u201cI am going into shadows,\u201d he told her. \u201cIf I stay too long, only your voice will bring me back. Remember.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca covered her mouth with her hand to stop from crying out.</p><p>\u201cI love you, wife.\u201d His talent reached across the bond, became the boundaries of a dark dream. \u201cNow hurry into the tunnel, before they find you.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>Reese didn\u2019t resist the guards holding her or give them any reason to think she understood their language. She kept her expression frightened and her demeanor helpless, and deliberately stumbled now and then over her own feet.</p><p>\u201cThis one is a rabbit,\u201d the burly guard observed, his grip loosening a few degrees. \u201cWe should keep her to serve us in the hall.\u201d</p><p>The other guard scowled. \u201cSaetta said the mortals are to be kept in the tunnels with the garrison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they might feed on and take their pleasure of them at their leisure while we choke on bagged blood?\u201d The burly guard spit on the floor. \u201c\u2019Tis a foolish waste of good humans.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey have not so many,\u201d his companion said, as if to console himself. \u201cThey will have to ration them.\u201d</p><p>It disgusted Reese to hear herself spoken of as if she were nothing more than food, but she kept the fear on her face as she surveyed the corridor ahead of them. A fan of short lances displayed beside a window caught her attention before she lowered her gaze and gathered her will.</p><p>\u201cAt least we are to patrol the house,\u201d the burly guard said. \u201cI do not envy our brothers on perimeter patrol. They will be the first to fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis American lord would not dare siege his own stronghold,\u201d the other guard replied. \u201cNot if he values the lives of his men.\u201d</p><p>Reese moaned and curled over, halting the guards in their tracks. She dropped, clutching at her belly.</p><p>\u201cWhat is she about now?\u201d the second guard demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know their tongue any more than you do,\u201d the burly one snarled. When Reese made retching sounds, he released her. \u201cOh, she is going to puke.\u201d</p><p>The other guard let go of her arm and stood back. As soon as he did Reese straightened and lunged for the lances, grabbing two and extending her arms so that the copper tips pressed into each guard\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cOn your knees,\u201d she ordered them in Italian. \u201cHands behind your heads.\u201d</p><p>Both men sank carefully down on the stones, folding their fingers over the back of their necks.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Locksley?\u201d she demanded. When neither man answered, she jabbed them with the lances. \u201cTell me or die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lord is in the city,\u201d the burly one said sullenly.</p><p>Reese swallowed against the shriek of frustration that rose in her throat. \u201cYou,\u201d she said to the scowling guard. \u201cToss your pistol onto the floor.\u201d She turned her head toward the burly one. \u201cYou pick it up.\u201d When he did so, she added, \u201cShoot him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She drove the lance an inch into his chest. \u201cShoot him, or I will skewer your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot escape the house,\u201d the scowling guard told her. \u201cOur men have\u2014\u201d A dart appeared in the side of his neck, and with a grunt of surprise he fell backward.</p><p>She placed the tip of the lance she had used on the unconscious guard under the fat chin of the burly one. \u201cNow shoot yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaetta will drain you dry.\u201d With an ugly look he turned the pistol on himself before he, too, collapsed.</p><p>Reese crouched to retrieve the pistol. \u201cSaetta wouldn\u2019t like the way I taste.\u201d</p><p>She took what she needed from the burly guard, retrieved her bag from Will\u2019s rooms, and looked for her phone without success. The third guard, she decided, must have taken it with him. From there she made her way downstairs, and, once she located the entrance to the first basement level, she slipped inside.</p><p>No one stopped or questioned her as she made her way through the tight warren of passages to the dark stairwell leading to the subbasement level, carefully avoiding the storage tunnels where Locksley\u2019s garrison had been imprisoned. After using another vial from her bag, she found a dark corner and rested for a few minutes.</p><p>Robin of Locksley had not returned to Rosethorn, so all the months of careful planning were worthless now. There was no hope of completing her mission unless she returned to the city, found Locksley, and retrieved the book. She would have to use Will one last time.</p><p>But to leave Rosethorn under siege...</p><p>What the Italians and the English did to one another was not her concern, her father would say. These were matters in which they did not become involved. Their duty was to the mortal world, and the threat to innocent lives.</p><p>The scent of clover teased her nose.</p><p>Slowly she pushed herself up from the floor and silently followed the sweet fragrance, which led her to a third and final set of stairs, these concealed behind a large group of crates. They inclined sharply down to a single, dark tunnel.</p><p>This one, Reese knew, had been built under Locksley\u2019s land, and would likely be more than a mile in length. It had not been in the building plans, but Father had assured her it would be there.</p><p>\u201cAfter the jardin wars, they always installed an escape tunnel,\u201d he told her. \u201cIt will be at the lowest point of the stronghold. If something goes wrong, find it and it will lead you to a vehicle you may use.\u201d</p><p>As Reese entered the tunnel, she saw the glimmer of electric torches and smelled other scents blending with that of the clover. The women, she realized, had escaped the house, and even now were hurrying toward freedom.</p><p>And Rebecca, who had been so kind to her, was leading them.</p><p>Will worked quickly to manage the humans caught up in the attack on the gallery, aware as he did that Robin had deliberately revealed himself to Chris in order to separate her from the others. Will didn\u2019t approve\u2014unwitting or not, the meddling federal agent had provided both Guisbourne and the contessa with the perfect opportunity to rout his master\u2014but he had no more say in the matter than he suspected she did.</p><p>Once he had dealt with the police and the gallery patrons, he used his contacts in the Atlanta Police Department to complete the arrangements and obtain the location of the patrol unit that had taken Robin and Chris away. He took the limousine and caught up with them on a deserted stretch of highway just outside the city.</p><p>Will saw Robin holding Chris, both of their garments disheveled, as the policeman escorting them walked back to his unit. He parked behind the patrol and got out.</p><p>As he approached, Will saw how furious the mortal female was, and how determined his master looked.</p><p>\u201cHow did you make him do that?\u201d Chris was demanding.</p><p>\u201cI promise you, I shall explain everything when this is over.\u201d Robin saw Will and turned to him. \u201cWere you able to deal with all of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent the police back on patrol; they were most obliging. Our friends in the department will see to any records. The guests are locked inside the building. They will sleep until dawn and have no memory of the attack. The ice should be melted by then, and then our friends will go around and finish tidying up.\u201d He indicated Chris. \u201cShe is the only one left.\u201d</p><p>The mortal\u2019s eyed narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re not drugging me.\u201d She fought against Robin\u2019s grasp. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTell me his name,\u201d Robin said, \u201cand I shall release you.\u201d</p><p>So she had been a part of this plot. \u201cLet me have her, my lord,\u201d Will said, removing one of his blades. \u201cShe will tell me what you wish to know.\u201d</p><p>Chris eyed Will\u2019s dagger and then addressed his master. \u201cHis name was Paul Sherwood. Now let go of me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI said I would release you,\u201d Robin advised her. \u201cI did not say I would do it now.\u201d As she began writhing against him, he said to Will, \u201cBe aware that l\u2019attrait has no affect on her whatsoever. I am none too sure that our talent does, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could kill her,\u201d he offered. \u201cThat would solve the problem.\u201d</p><p>Robin frowned at him and then saw Chris\u2019s expression. \u201cHe is only joking,\u201d he told her. To Will, he said, \u201cTake us back to the penthouse.\u201d</p><p>On the journey back to the Armstrong building, Will kept the divider window down and listened, but the mortal female remained silent, and did not try to fight his master or free herself. When he felt sure she had acquiesced\u2014for the moment, anyway\u2014he placed calls to some of their human friends to confirm her claims.</p><p>\u201cShe told the truth,\u201d he said to Robin after finishing his calls. \u201cA Paul Sherwood left Atlanta International on a chartered flight for Rome. The charter was paid for by a Helen Moran. Our people at the airport are examining their security tapes to see if this Sherwood matches Guisbourne\u2019s description.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe will,\u201d Chris said, sounding resigned. \u201cHelen Moran manages the clothing shop next to the gallery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Robin said.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s left the country, there\u2019s nothing you can do,\u201d she said, changing her manner abruptly. \u201cLet me go, and I\u2019ll alert Interpol. They\u2019ll arrest him as soon as he steps off the plane in Rome.\u201d When his master said nothing, her voice grew sharp. \u201cRobin, that book is priceless.\u201d</p><p>So is Reese, Will thought.</p><p>Chris tried once more to run when Will stopped outside the building, but his master seized her up in his arms and carried her struggling form inside. He didn\u2019t put her back on her feet until they were in the elevator and traveling up to the penthouse level.</p><p>\u201cWere there any of our Kyn who were not at the stronghold when Salva\u2019s men took over?\u201d Robin asked as he pried the remains of the policeman\u2019s manacles from his wrists and gave them to Will.</p> <p>\u201cFazio, Mason, and Sullivan were on guard duty here.\u201d The three warriors were good men, but Will would have traded them all for his castellan, who in his human life had besieged dozens of strongholds. \u201cSylas said to give his love to Rebecca, so I think his wife must have gotten some of the humans and the other women out before they could secure them.\u201d</p><p>Robin nodded. \u201cRebecca will bring them to our friends in Marietta before she attempts to contact us. As soon as she reports in, I shall speak to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we not call on our allies for assistance, my lord?\u201d Will shoved the twisted steel cuffs into his pocket. \u201cSuzeraina Jayr could have her garrison here in a matter of hours.\u201d</p><p>Robin\u2019s face became a stony mask.</p><p>\u201cNo. I do not wish the suzeraina involved in this.\u201d The elevator stopped and he stepped out into the corridor, frowning when Chris did not. \u201cYou cannot stay in the elevator all night, love. There is no place to sit but the floor.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t join him. \u201cYou took those cuffs off like they were made of plastic. You can make cops\u2014anyone\u2014do anything. You\u2019ve got fangs.\u201d Her gaze skittered to Will\u2019s face, and he saw the panic in her eyes. \u201cWhat are you people?\u201d</p><p>Had she been a Brethren operative, she would not have wasted her time feigning such innocence. She would save her energies to do whatever it took to kill or escape them.</p><p>Some of the ugly suspicion cleared from Will\u2019s head as he said to Robin, \u201cI shall prepare some tea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMake it strong and sweet. Everything will be all right, Chris. Come.\u201d Robin coaxed her out of the elevator and led her into his penthouse.</p><p>Will retreated to the kitchen. He stood over the sink, turning on the taps and splashing his face before he filled the kettle and put it on the stove. If they somehow survived this siege, and his master decided to install Chris in his city home, Will would have to look into purchasing a Teasmade.</p><p>Two, perhaps, if Reese survived.</p><p>Slowly he prepared a tray with a porcelain cup, saucer, cream, and sugar. He had no idea what the American took in her tea; they did so many barbaric things with it in this country that the possibilities were endless. To keep his hands busy, he took a lemon from the bowl of fruit he kept out for the mortal staff.</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing wrong with peach tea,\u201d Reese had said to him one night after she\u2019d raided his small larder to concoct the beverage. \u201cIt\u2019s traditional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, tea is traditional,\u201d he argued. \u201cSqueezing peach juice into it is revolting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just jealous because I can drink it and you can\u2019t,\u201d she said, laughing as he took the glass from her. \u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d she warned as he lifted it to his lips. \u201cRemember what happened when you tried my favorite champagne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d he said as he returned the glass to her hands. \u201cRefresh my memory. Who was it who said champagne was simply fizzy wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said to take a sip, like so.\u201d She sipped the tea, her eyes smiling at him over the rim. \u201cNot drink half the bottle.\u201d</p><p>He gathered her against him. \u201cGive me a taste.\u201d When she lifted the glass to his lips, he took it and set it aside. \u201cNot like that.\u201d</p><p>The sharp smell of lemon made Will look down. He had crushed the lemon in his hand, and all that remained of it was a pulpy mess. He discarded the pulverized fruit, took another from the bowl, and sliced it before carrying the tray out to the front rooms.</p><p>His master lay on the floor with the mortal female atop him.</p><p>\u201cAll the way through, love,\u201d Robin said. \u201cHalf measures don\u2019t work on my kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am through playing this game, Robin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>Will smelled blood and bergamot, and hurried forward. When he saw that Chris held a knife to his master\u2019s throat, the tray dropped out of his hands and smashed to the floor. \u201cBloody hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay where you are, Will. Whatever she does to me, you will not touch her.\u201d Robin didn\u2019t look away from the mortal\u2019s reddened face. \u201cKill me and it will be over. My seneschal will not harm you. But the contessa will see to it that hundreds will die\u2014humans and Kyn, my entire jardin. One of them will be your partner.\u201d</p><p>Her head turned from side to side. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. I don\u2019t believe any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I give you proof, will you help me get the book?\u201d</p><p>Chris sat up and took the dagger away from Robin\u2019s neck. Will caught his breath when he saw the shallow wound on his master\u2019s throat, which promptly disappeared. The federal agent held herself rigid, and a strange look came over her face.</p><p>Will knew that look, and went to gently remove the blade from her fingers. She didn\u2019t try to keep hold of it.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be real.\u201d Chris tottered to her feet, her arms hanging limp at her sides as she stared down at his master. \u201cYou can\u2019t be.\u201d She put out an arm, and her eyes rolled up into her head.</p><p>Will got to her before she collapsed, and lifted her into his arms. The paleness of her young face made him sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll make more tea.\u201d</p><p>Robin got up from the floor. \u201cPut her in my bedchamber,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd bolt the door.\u201d</p><p>Will placed Chris on Robin\u2019s bed, removing her heels and covering her with the linens before he straightened. She might be more interested in jailing his master than bedding him, but she was only human. The faint dark half circles under her eyes and a small gnaw mark on her lower lip tugged at his heart.</p><p>\u201cPoor girl,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a time of it tonight, you have.\u201d He tucked the coverlet around her and turned off the bedside lamp before he left, carefully locking the door behind him.</p><p>He found Robin on the phone, talking to the contessa. \u201cNottingham will be landing in Italy in a few hours. He is beyond my reach now. I cannot retrieve the manuscript for you.\u201d</p><p>Will went to pick up the broken crockery from the tray. As he cleaned up the mess, he listened to his master argue with Salvatora.</p><p>\u201cShe will be a hindrance to me,\u201d Robin said at last, and looked at Will. \u201cI shall leave her here with my seneschal. He will keep her sequestered until my return.\u201d</p><p>When Will saw him look at the screen on the phone, he came over and saw that the contessa had sent a video of a black mortal being brutally beaten. Will recognized him as one of the federal agents working at the gallery\u2014the one Dennis had called \u201cHutch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen enough,\u201d Robin said. \u201cStop before you kill him.\u201d</p><p>The image of the contessa\u2019s satisfied face appeared on the screen. \u201cI shall see you and your human lover, in Rome, in two days. Be sure you have the manuscript, my lord. If you do not, her partner dies, and you will revisit every one of the happy memories you have of the jardin war trials.\u201d</p><p>The phone\u2019s screen turned blank.</p><p>\u201cShe would not do this thing unless she felt sure she could get away with it,\u201d Will said as he realized what she meant to do. \u201cOnce she has the manuscript, she will kill you and Agent Renshaw. Then she can blame your deaths on Nottingham, or make up any story she likes.\u201d</p><p>Robin went over to the cabinet where he stored his personal weapons and removed his bow case. \u201cContact Jayr and Lucan, and tell them only that I am in Europe, and in my absence refugee Kyn have captured my stronghold. Ask them to send as many warriors as they can spare. Surround the keep, but do nothing for two days. If I do not call you by the end of the second, you must lead them in and save as many as you can.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhile you die alone in Rome.\u201d Will would have none of that.</p><p>\u201cI have lived seven lifetimes, old friend, and I am certain that death is ready for me. My task is to do whatever I must to protect Chris.\u201d Robin came to him and braced a hand against his shoulder. \u201cYou helped me build the stronghold; no one knows it as well as you. That gives you an advantage over the contessa\u2019s men. Use it. Remember how we routed the king\u2019s men in Sherwood. I know you will prevail.\u201d</p><p>As much as he disliked it, Will knew what his duty was. Robin could not fight a battle on two fronts. \u201cI shall earn you faith in me, but that bitch will not get away with this. As soon as our people are secure, I shall call the high lord and make him aware of her treachery. Then I shall hunt her down and take her head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be too busy for that.\u201d Robin opened his case and adjusted the packing around his bow. \u201cIf I am slain, you are to take my place as suzerain.\u201d</p> <p>Will uttered a sour chuckle. \u201cThat is as likely as my assuming the throne of England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have already advised Cyprien.\u201d His master shut the lid of the case and secured it. \u201cHe agreed with my choice. There will be no opposition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not jesting.\u201d Will gaped him before he shoved aside his astonishment. \u201cMy lord, if you have forgotten, my father was a smith, and my mother a laundress. The only noble blood in my veins came from the mortal gentry I fed on whenever I could lure one of them into the woods. If not for you, I should have ended dangling from a rope at a crossroads. Pledging myself to you, taking vows, fighting in the Holy Land, surviving death, being made Kyn\u2014it surely saved me, but it did not make me another man. I was an outlaw. A thief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo was I.\u201d Robin offered the bow case to him. \u201cI am not dead yet, Will. There is still hope.\u201d The sound of a knob twisting made him glance toward his bedchamber. \u201cIt seems my special agent has awoken. Call the airport and have a plane standing by.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p> <p>Rebecca went to the open window of her bedchamber, where the warm April night beckoned to her. She did not miss the old days, when the hunger had compelled Sylas to go out and hunt as soon as the sun set and the mortal world prepared to sleep. Her satisfaction dimmed a little as the stars brightened, making tiny rainbows dance before her eyes. At the same time, her skin began to shed the scent of sweet clover.</p><p>Something had stirred her talent. \u201cSylas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am here, lass.\u201d Sylas came to stand behind her and folded his arms around hers. \u201cI will help you fight it.\u201d</p><p>The memories were returning. Rebecca heard bitter weeping and terrible laughter. \u201cI do not think you can this time.\u201d</p><p>He turned her to face him and spoke. Although she could no longer hear him, he knew she could see and read his lips. \u201cYou must resist it.\u201d</p><p>The strange voices filling her ears fell abruptly silent, and she drooped, clutching him for a moment as she regained her balance. \u201cI cannot leave you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot stay.\u201d He rubbed a hand over her back. \u201cYou are stronger than you think, wife. Have faith.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. She was not strong; she had never been strong. Not since that terrible night, the first night she had woken in Sylas\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cI know you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>She was his lady. Rebecca held on to that promise. She would do as he wished. She would resist. She would not harm anyone. She was his lady.</p><p>My lady.</p><p>\u201cMy lady.\u201d Hands were touching her, shaking her. \u201cMy lady, please wake up.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca opened her eyes to see Lettice standing over her. \u201cNo,\u201d she muttered. \u201c\u2019Twas not enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady,\u201d the seamstress pleaded, \u201cyou must rouse yourself. We dare not wait any longer.\u201d</p> <p>Horrified that she had fallen asleep, she jerked. \u201cHave they found us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my lady, but they are searching for us. Come.\u201d She bent to put an arm around her.</p><p>Rebecca gripped Lettice\u2019s hand, gritting her teeth as the movement strained the wound in her side. She was not healing, and that was always the first sign. The next would be the constant shedding of her scent.</p><p>\u201cGive me a moment.\u201d She gasped the words as she found her feet. The shadows in the tunnel seemed to lengthen and draw close around her, and she nearly wept with relief. \u201cTish, move away from me.\u201d She looked at the others. \u201cStay beneath the lights.\u201d</p><p>Lettice drew back, moving away quickly to stand with the other women under the dim glow of the single bulb hanging from the ceiling.</p><p>A voice came from the shadows, whispering in the cold, damp stillness. \u201cRebecca.\u201d</p><p>Thank God, he knew her. \u201cI am here, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake word,\u201d the ghostly voice said. \u201cThe one in charge has silver in his hair and a sword scar across his face. The men call him Saetta. He has fortified the barriers and posted guards everywhere.\u201d</p><p>She tried to see a face in the pool of darkness; sometimes he could come that far. \u201cHow many weapons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey each carry a dart gun and extra cartridges. They also wield swords, daggers, the lot.\u201d Something blue glittered in the shadows. \u201cThey have not found our cache yet. They look for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will be gone.\u201d Rebecca thought frantically. \u201cEven if you could free the men and arm them, you are outnumbered three to one. What about our stores?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were the first thing I destroyed.\u201d His voice grew more distant. \u201cThey are coming for me now. Find Will, Rebecca, and tell him everything.\u201d A hand formed from the darkness and reached out to her. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She tried to touch him, but her hand passed through the shadowy fingers and touched only the rough, damp stone. \u201cSylas.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca fell forward, caught by the arms of one of her ladies. She held on to the other female until her legs felt steadier.</p><p>\u201cYou are right, Lettice. They do search for us. We must move quickly.\u201d The face of the woman holding her came into focus. \u201cReese. I did not realize it was you. Forgive me.\u201d Rebecca tried to clear her thoughts. \u201cYou were not in the main hall when we fled the fighting. How did you find us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlain sent me down here to use the escape tunnel.\u201d The mortal female put an arm around her back. \u201cWho were those men upstairs? Why did they take over Rosethorn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will explain later.\u201d She stumbled forward, gesturing to the other ladies. \u201cCome. We must take the caravan into the city before daybreak. Reese, have you a mobile phone with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I...dropped it.\u201d</p><p>None of the other women carried phones, Rebecca knew. \u201cWe will stop to make use of a pay phone somewhere along the way. Quickly now.\u201d</p><p>After Will took Robin and Chris to the airport, he returned to his master\u2019s city home and summoned the three men he had left.</p><p>\u201cOur lord is sending us to Rosethorn,\u201d he told them. \u201cI am to call upon Suzeraina Jayr and Suzerain Lucan. For them and their men, we will need everything from the storerooms and whatever you can borrow from our mortal friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many at the stronghold?\u201d Fazio asked.</p><p>\u201cSeventy-three.\u201d</p><p>Mason gave him an incredulous look. \u201cSeneschal, even seventy-three Mongols could not take Rosethorn from our garrison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey used deceit and drugs,\u201d Will told him. \u201cNow they hold our Kyn hostage. Our lord has gone to Rome to placate their mistress. In two days\u2019 time, if he has not, we attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we be prepared for that in but two days?\u201d Sullivan wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cWe must, or the lives of our brothers and sisters will be forfeit.\u201d Will held out his hand. \u201cUnto the last man, we fight.\u201d</p><p>The other three clapped their hands atop his. \u201cUnto the last man.\u201d</p><p>Will went to the communications room, which still held maps and plans used during the search for Valentin Jaus. There he placed the calls to his master\u2019s allies and told them of the summons to arms.</p><p>\u201cWe will be there before nightfall,\u201d Suzeraina Jayr of the Realm promised, her voice grim. \u201cHow many do I bring?\u201d</p><p>Too many warriors would strain their resources, and too few would prove ineffective. The old rule had been four to one, but that had allowed for a quarter to starve or be killed by defender fire. \u201cOne hundred of your best, if you please, my lady.\u201d</p><p>The second call to Suzerain Lucan proved even easier.</p><p>\u201cA siege? How delightful.\u201d The high lord\u2019s former chief assassin yawned. \u201cMy men are yours. Where and when?\u201d</p><p>Will also requested that Lucan bring one hundred of his most experienced warriors. \u201cWe are most grateful, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are, but I daresay it choked Robin of Locksley to ask for my aid.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cNever fear, seneschal. My garrison is filled with Spaniards, and they have never forgiven the Italians for claiming they discovered this country. We will be most happy to dispatch them from it.\u201d</p><p>Will then placed a call to the sanctuary house in Marietta, to alert them about Rebecca and the other women traveling there.</p><p>\u201cWe will prepare for them immediately, seneschal,\u201d the woman in charge of the house said. \u201cDo you know how many escaped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but they may have mortals with them, so be ready for wounded.\u201d Will prayed Rebecca had taken Reese out of the stronghold. \u201cContact me as soon as they reach you.\u201d</p><p>The airless, dark escape tunnel extended almost two miles beneath Rosethorn\u2019s outlying lands, and by the time they emerged from the other end into a heavily wooded but otherwise vacant lot by the highway, Reese wanted to do nothing more than throw herself down and rub her face in the grass.</p><p>\u201cThe caravan is over here, beneath this brush.\u201d Rebecca waded through the overgrown weeds and pulled a mat of dead pine branches away from the front end of a large truck.</p><p>Reese went to help her, and as soon as they uncovered the cab she looked inside. \u201cNo keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are here.\u201d Rebecca reached under the front wheel well and groped until she produced a small magnetic box, which she handed to Reese. \u201cI do not wish to impose on you, but we cannot operate the vehicle.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNone of you can drive?\u201d Reese watched the other women shaking their heads. \u201cWell, it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve driven a lorry, but I\u2019ll give it a go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is a lorry?\u201d Lettice asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat they call a truck in England.\u201d Reese forced a smile. \u201cOne of my tresoran mentors was English. I guess I picked up some of his slang.\u201d</p> <p>Once they had cleared off the camouflaging branches, Reese unlocked the back of the truck and helped the women inside. Rebecca, however, refused to climb in.</p><p>\u201cI shall ride up front with you.\u201d When Reese began to protest, she said, \u201cI am the only one who knows the way to the sanctuary house in Marietta.\u201d</p><p>Reese hadn\u2019t considered that the women would want to go anywhere else but Atlanta. \u201cI think we should drive to the city instead. Lord Locksley is there, and we\u2019ll be safe with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe cannot,\u201d Rebecca said. \u201cOur lord\u2019s city home may also have been seized by the Italians. If we are ever forced to leave the estate, our instructions are to go to the sanctuary house and wait there for our men.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t argue with that. \u201cI understand.\u201d She\u2019d have to stop at a pay phone along the way and call her father from there. \u201cLet\u2019s get rolling.\u201d</p> <p>Reese took a moment to familiarize herself with the truck\u2019s instruments before she started the engine and slowly eased the vehicle out across the lot and onto the road. She drove slowly at first\u2014the truck had not been used in some time, and the engine had a tendency to sputter\u2014but soon she increased her speed to just under the road\u2019s limit.</p><p>\u201cI imagine this is the last thing you thought you would be doing when you came to Rosethorn tonight,\u201d Rebecca said as she took a pouch from the glove compartment and tucked it into the pocket of her skirt.</p><p>Reese nodded. \u201cThis definitely tops the list.\u201d She saw the lines of strain around the other woman\u2019s mouth. \u201cAre you doing okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not left the estate since we came to America,\u201d she said slowly.</p><p>\u201cHow long ago was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo hundred years and better.\u201d The chatelaine sighed. \u201cI thought about it from time to time, but when Sherman came and burned the city during that very uncivil mortal war, I decided living at Rosethorn was adventure enough for me.\u201d She glanced at Reese. \u201cYou must think me a simpleton.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is nothing wrong with being happy at home,\u201d Reese corrected. \u201cI envy you in some ways.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca stared out the side window. \u201cYou never should.\u201d</p><p>She must have reminded the woman of something unhappy. Reese knew she was missing her husband\u2014anyone who saw them together could see that they were soul mates\u2014but she wondered how a lovely woman like the chatelaine had fallen in love with a big, dark brute like Sylas. \u201cHow did you meet your husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever he was in England, Sylas came to the convent where I lived to visit his youngest sister,\u201d Rebecca said. \u201cShe was one of my charges.\u201d</p><p>Reese\u2019s brows arched. \u201cThat would make you a nun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was, and Sylas a soldier of fortune.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI have shocked you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve met Buddhist advertising executives, vegetarian meatpackers, and one time I sat next to a girl on a plane who swore she was the secret love child of Princess Di and the lead singer of Duran Duran.\u201d Reese shifted on the hard vinyl seat. \u201cGetting caught in the siege of a castle during the twenty-first century, that pretty much tops everything, even a nun married to a mercenary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe never actually married,\u201d Rebecca admitted. \u201cWhen the sickness began to spread through the county around the convent, Sylas came to take his sister away. Unfortunately, by the time he arrived, she was already sick and too ill to be moved. Everyone fled but me and a few of the older sisters. And Sylas. He would not leave his sister\u2019s side.\u201d</p> <p>More bad memories. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have asked\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my dear, I do not mind speaking of it. We worked together to care for the sick.\u201d She closed her eyes. \u201cI came to know him during those long hours in the infirmary. The night his sister died, Sylas and I both began coughing. I knew that it was likely that I would go before him, so I asked my friend, Sister Marian, to bury us together. She honored my last request, bless her soul. Three days later I woke up in the ground. In his arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very romantic.\u201d Reese frowned. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I just said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so frightened, but Sylas...he took care of me. He was such a formidable man to look upon, you understand, but I had witnessed myself how gentle he could be. I trusted him.\u201d She looked down at her hands, which she held tightly folded in her lap. \u201cEven in the grave we shared.\u201d</p><p>Reese grimaced. \u201cI hope he got you out of there in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first I thought perhaps they had buried us alive,\u201d Rebecca said. \u201cIt happened all too frequently in our time. But Sylas said that no, we had died, for he had held me until my last breath. He thought that somehow God had been persuaded to give us another chance.\u201d</p><p>The chatelaine told her how her husband had broken through the lid of the coffin they had shared, and pushed away the soil above it.</p><p>\u201cWe were both so weak by the time we were free, and yet he carried me into the forest and kept me safe with him. Over the next days we discovered the bizarre changes made to us\u2014we could heal from any wound, but we could no longer eat food or drink anything\u2014and tried to make sense of it.\u201d Rebecca shook her head. \u201cI do not know what would have happened to us had not the dark Kyn found us and taken us away with them. They told us what we were, and how we could live.\u201d</p><p>Reese\u2019s eyes felt heavy. \u201cThen you fell in love with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. I did that when I was a mortal.\u201d Rebecca turned her head and sat up suddenly. \u201cReese, open the window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The air was sweet and warm, and made her feel as if she were breathing in pure honey.</p><p>\u201cI am shedding too much scent.\u201d Rebecca reached across her to wind down the window, and then did the same on her own side of the cab. \u201c\u2019Twill be all right. The effect wears off quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Reese\u2019s head cleared. \u201cHow could that have happened? L\u2019attrait has no...it usually has no effect on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine is somewhat more potent than that of other Kyn.\u201d She looked away. \u201cForgive me. I will try to better guard myself until we reach Marietta.\u201d</p><p>What an odd way to put it, Reese thought. She glanced down at the chatelaine\u2019s side and saw through a tear in her gown an open wound. \u201cRebecca, that gash should have healed by now.\u201d She looked ahead for an exit. \u201cI\u2019ll find a place to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it is not necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need blood\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never feed on mortals.\u201d</p><p>Reese cringed. \u201cYou can\u2019t be using the blood of animals; it would have made you a changeling. What other...\u201d She gave Rebecca a startled look. \u201cSylas feeds you. After he hunts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your voice down.\u201d Rebecca glanced back at the small window between the cab and the back of the truck. \u201cI cannot hunt, not with my talent, so Sylas looks after my needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only ones who feed from other Kyn are...\u201d Suddenly Reese understood a great deal about the chatelaine. \u201cThat\u2019s why you never leave Rosethorn. Why Sylas doesn\u2019t want anyone touching you. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Pale eyes closed. \u201cThat is why.\u201d</p><p>Cold dread filled Reese. \u201cJust how powerful is your talent, Rebecca?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have it under control; that is all that matters.\u201d She glanced back at the window. \u201cNone of my ladies know of this, Reese. Please do not tell them. It will only frighten them.\u201d</p><p>As she came up on the exit to Marietta, Reese slowed. \u201cThere\u2019s a truck stop at the end of this ramp. I need to use the phone and contact the suzerain. Will you be okay if I stop for a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d Rebecca wrapped her arms around her waist and fell silent.</p><p>Reese parked the truck between two tractor trailers, and walked across the lot to a pay phone. It wasn\u2019t until she lifted the receiver that she realized she had no coins with her, and dialed the number collect.</p><p>Her father accepted the charges, his voice frantic as he said, \u201cYou are not at Rosethorn. Do you have the book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Father.\u201d Shame gnawed at her. \u201cThe stronghold was attacked by another group of Kyn. Lord Locksley did not return to the estate before they neutralized the guards and took over the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLocksley has gone to Rome after Guisbourne,\u201d he said, his voice dull. \u201cHe must have taken the book with him, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not think he would risk taking it out of the country,\u201d Reese said. \u201cHe would have left it behind with Will for safekeeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind Scarlet,\u201d her father ordered. \u201cAt once.\u201d</p><p>Now she had to admit to the rest of her failure. \u201cThere are some women who escaped the estate with me,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are sitting in the back of a lorry, waiting for me to deliver them to safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they mortals?\u201d When she didn\u2019t answer, her father said, \u201cI thought not. Leave them there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot one of them can drive,\u201d she argued. \u201cIt will be dawn soon. Father, please. I need only an hour to take them to their sanctuary house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave them, my child, and you condemn the world.\u201d</p><p>Reese pressed her forehead against the edge of the pay phone\u2019s stand. \u201cDo not ask this of me.\u201d</p><p>His voice became a whip. \u201cI am not asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d She hung up the phone and stood for a moment, looking at the vehicles around her. She would have to leave the truck with them, but she saw no cars parked anywhere. She was about to walk to the diner to beg a ride from one of the men inside when Rebecca caught her arm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>Reese thought fast. \u201cLord Locksley has gone to Rome after an old enemy. I am needed in Atlanta at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are needed here.\u201d Rebecca shook her arm. \u201cMy ladies and I cannot go on foot. The sunrise is but an hour away. Reese, do you hear me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStay in the back of the truck,\u201d she said desperately. \u201cI\u2019ll send someone to get you. I have to do this. It\u2019s a matter of life and death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Rebecca looked at a man walking past them, and stepped into his path. The scent of clover rolled out from her as she smiled at him. \u201cI need you to drive a truck to Marietta, to this address.\u201d She told him the house and street number. \u201cDo you know where it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, honey. My cousin Walker lives in that part of town.\u201d He grinned and wiped his hand under his nose. \u201cWhere\u2019s the truck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver there.\u201d Rebecca held out her hand. \u201cGive me the keys, Reese.\u201d</p><p>Reese handed them to her, and Rebecca gave them to the trucker, but didn\u2019t follow him as he strolled toward the truck.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to go with him,\u201d Reese said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be near a mortal who has no resistance,\u201d Rebecca told her. \u201cHe will succumb and run the vehicle off the road. I am coming with you.\u201d</p><p>Reese shook her head. \u201cYou could stay in the back of the truck, away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would not make a difference now. Besides that, I have to speak to Will. There is one who can take us.\u201d Rebecca limped toward a trucker who had left the diner and was headed for one of the tractor trailers.</p><p>Reese caught up with her. \u201cYou could make this one crash his truck just as easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will get into the back. The cargo area is sealed.\u201d She took the pouch from the pocket of her skirt and removed a handful of bills from it, which she placed in Reese\u2019s hand. \u201cUse this to hire him.\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>Saetta recalled his lieutenants to the main hall, where they delivered their reports. The interior guard, along with the courtyard and perimeter patrols, had been taken and imprisoned in the tunnels beneath the stronghold. The mortals they had found among the unconscious Kyn had been separated and placed under close guard. Their scouts kept watch for any approaching attackers, but none so far had appeared.</p><p>Not all the news was good. His men had failed to recover the female Kyn who had escaped from the hall during the initial attack. Two guards escorting a female mortal had been discovered unconscious; both had been drugged with their own darts. The body of a third guard, found floating facedown in the water of an enormous bath, had also been found.</p><p>Saetta had hoped to take Rosethorn without any deaths. \u201cHow was he killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot say, mar\u00e9chal. He bled out into the water, but we found no wounds on his body.\u201d The man crossed himself and then made a much older gesture intended to ward off the evil eye.</p><p>Saetta knew the women had likely escaped through an underground passage, but he ordered the stronghold to be searched again to be sure they had not concealed themselves somewhere in the house. \u201cWhat of Sylas, the castellan?\u201d</p><p>The men glanced at one another. \u201cWe found him in his rooms, mar\u00e9chal. He lay upon the floor, and we could not rouse him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he is drugged like the others.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe found no darts on him.\u201d The guard looked unhappy. \u201cHis heart is still, his skin is cold, and he does not breathe.\u201d</p><p>Saetta knew some of their kind could flee their bodies and take refuge in the dreamlands, where the Kyn briefly went sometimes when they rested. There, too, they became trapped when in thrall, a state brought on by feeding on a be spelled human until they were drained of blood. But had Sylas fallen into thrall, he would have had a dying human with him, and his body would have been warmed by the blood he had taken. \u201cCarry him down here to the hall and post guards by him. Have you secured the stores?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe found their cold room,\u201d one lieutenant admitted, \u201cbut one of them got to it first. The bags were slashed, and the pooled blood that leaked from them was strewn with copper coins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeliberately tainted.\u201d That effectively rendered the blood worthless to them. \u201cWe will have to begin using the mortals tomorrow. Set up\u2014\u201d</p><p>A hoarse scream echoed through the hall, followed by shouts for help. Saetta drew his sword and led his lieutenants to the source in the passage outside.</p><p>Three guards stood, backs toward one another other, their blades drawn. Their eyes darted around them as they turned, searching for something.</p><p>Saetta looked as well, but saw nothing. \u201cWhat are you about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt attacked Isidro,\u201d one of the guards said. \u201cIt came out of the wall and took him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat came out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA demon.\u201d The guard stabbed at the shadows. \u201cA demon made of smoke.\u201d</p><p>Saetta\u2019s heel slid on something wet, and he glanced down at a pistol, a sword, and a pile of garments in a pool of blood. He lifted the garments and found a pair of scarred boots.</p><p>\u201cThose belong to Isidro,\u201d one of his lieutenants said.</p><p>\u201cA man does not disappear and leave behind his clothes. It is a trick.\u201d Saetta dropped the garments and went to the wall, running his hand along the stone, feeling for a seam. He found nothing to indicate a hidden passage, but the stone itself was so cold it felt icy. \u201cSearch the passages. Find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of the demon, mar\u00e9chal?\u201d one of the guards asked.</p><p>\u201cThere are no such things,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe saw it,\u201d another of the guards insisted. \u201cIt was not a man. It had no face or body. It was made of black smoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever demon you encountered is but a Kyn using talent.\u201d He turned to his second. \u201cBring one of the English up from the tunnels for questioning. I will know who this \u2018smoke demon\u2019 is, and what he can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReese,\u201d the trucker said as he drove down the highway. \u201cAin\u2019t that the same name of that gal what played in that dumb-blonde movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She rubbed her tired eyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know, she always dressed in piank \u2019n\u2019 carried around one them li\u2019l dogs. Had a sweet li\u2019l ass on her.\u201d He shifted the wad of tobacco from one cheek to the other, and lifted the Coke bottle he kept tucked between his thighs to spit a stream of brown liquid into it. When he caught her watching, he winked. \u201cGotta say, I\u2019m an ass man.\u201d</p><p>Reese stared at the road sign they were approaching. Fifteen miles to Atlanta. She could tolerate the ass man for fifteen more minutes.</p><p>The trucker continued talking, giving her a rambling synopsis of the movie and his estimation of the star\u2019s sexual talents based on her body type, demeanor, and mouth size.</p><p>Reese ignored him and stared through the bug-smeared windshield at the dark road ahead. She played out several scenarios in her head, rehearsing what she would say to Will and how she would use Rebecca to keep him occupied long enough for her to retrieve the book.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d A flannel-covered elbow prodded her. \u201cYou ain\u2019t heard a word I said, have ya?\u201d</p><p>She offered him a meaningless smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m a little tired.\u201d She frowned as she realized the truck had stopped in a dimly lit rest area. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed to take a piss.\u201d He leered at her. \u201cWanna come hold it for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yerself.\u201d He removed the keys from the ignition and climbed down out of the cab.</p><p>Reese watched him stroll to the restroom before she climbed out and went around to the back of the truck. Rebecca opened the door as soon as she rapped on it.</p><p>\u201cWhy have we stopped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe driver needed to use the bathroom.\u201d As Rebecca\u2019s scent rolled over her, she stepped back. \u201cWe\u2019ll be in the city in a few minutes. Be ready to get out the next time we stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, now,\u201d the trucker said, stepping around the side. \u201cYou paid me to take you to Atlanta, honey. You didn\u2019t say nothing about sneaking your friend in the back. And I know you can read.\u201d He jerked a thumb at one of his bumper stickers, which read, No Free Rides.</p><p>Rebecca jumped down and started toward him, but Reese held out her hand. \u201cWait, please.\u201d She turned to the driver. \u201cI gave you six hundred dollars to make the drive. That should be adequate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you, sure. Not for her.\u201d</p><p>Reese held on to her temper. \u201cThen I\u2019ll get more money for you when we reach the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that before, honey. But I think we can work something out.\u201d He stroked the whisker stubble on his chin as he looked both of them over. \u201cTell you what, I\u2019ll take it in trade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrade for what?\u201d Rebecca demanded.</p><p>The trucker ignored her and took hold of Reese\u2019s arm. \u201cYou come on in the back with me now. Got me a nice li\u2019l bunk in there.\u201d He pulled her toward the front cab.</p><p>She wrenched free. \u201cI am not having sex with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you can walk the rest of the way.\u201d He spit tobacco juice on the ground between them. \u201cMakes no never mind to me.\u201d He glanced behind her. \u201cMight be a bit rough on your girlfriend, there, though.\u201d</p><p>Reese heard Rebecca\u2019s dragging steps coming closer. \u201cYou\u2019re making a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. You bitches think you can get anything you want just by twitching your ass under a man\u2019s nose.\u201d He grabbed Reese by the hair. \u201cCome on. You do right by me, honey, and maybe I\u2019ll be too tired to screw the gimp.\u201d</p><p>The air filled with burning clover, and a hand shot past Reese\u2019s face and clamped around the trucker\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cRelease her.\u201d</p><p>The trucker\u2019s eyes bulged, and he let go of Reese\u2019s hair to pry at Rebecca\u2019s hand, but she kept her hold and backed him up against the truck. He began choking, making thick, liquid sounds. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRebecca, stop.\u201d Reese tried to go to her but cried out and pressed her hands to her head as something stabbed into her ears. \u201cDon\u2019t kill him.\u201d</p><p>The unconscious driver slid to the ground, and Rebecca crouched over him, intent. \u201cHe is a pig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca looked down at the trucker\u2019s face, and then slowly moved away. The smell of clover became thinner. She turned her head as Reese took a step toward her. \u201cStay where you are.\u201d</p> <p>Reese saw blood streaming from the trucker\u2019s eyes, nose, mouth, and ears. As the pain in her ears vanished, she pulled her hands away, and saw red stains on her palms. \u201cThis is your talent?\u201d</p><p>Rebecca uttered a laugh like a wail. \u201cMy curse, you mean. Yes.\u201d She met Reese\u2019s gaze levelly. \u201cThis is what I do. This is my power over the living world. I make it bleed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe living world? You mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMortals. Kyn. Animals.\u201d Her shoulders hunched. \u201cAnything with blood in its veins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said you can control it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen I am at Rosethorn, with Sylas, among our friends, yes, I can.\u201d Rebecca looked down at the trucker. \u201cWhen I am away from him, alone and angry...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you need to calm down,\u201d Reese said carefully.</p><p>Slowly Rebecca moved away from him, her movements lurching and painful to watch. She hesitated, removing the copper dagger from her girdle and turning it over to offer the hilt to Reese.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it,\u201d Rebecca told her. \u201cIf I lose control, I will do whatever I must to return to Sylas. I will kill anything that stands between me and my lord. Should it come to that, you know what you must do.\u201d</p><p>Reese considered arguing with her, but the horizon was brightening and they were both exhausted. She put the dagger in her bag before she offered Rebecca her arm. \u201cLean on me, and I\u2019ll help you to the cab.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have too little regard for your own safety.\u201d Rebecca placed a hand on her shoulder, but glanced back. \u201cHe is not dead, or even badly hurt. When he wakes, he will report us to the authorities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be in the city by then.\u201d Reese led her over to the truck\u2019s cab, and helped her up inside. \u201cGo into the back of the cab; there aren\u2019t any windows so the sun won\u2019t bother you there. Try to get some sleep.\u201d She went around the cab, climbed up behind the wheel, and, remembering what she\u2019d seen the driver do, started the engine.</p><p>Rebecca emerged from the back a moment later. \u201cThat mortal has not been sleeping in there. It reeks of body fluids.\u201d She pulled the passenger\u2019s seat belt over her torso and clipped it in place.</p><p>Reese eyed her. \u201cWould you rather go in the trailer? You have to get some rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I cannot settle myself, not in this state.\u201d She put her head back and closed her eyes against the light from the rising sun. \u201cKeep the windows open and the air cooler set on high, and talk to me, please.\u201d</p><p>Reese took a moment to remember everything she had watched the trucker do when they had left the diner, and then carefully imitated his actions as she put the truck in gear, checked the side mirrors, and pulled back out onto the highway. Hopefully she wouldn\u2019t have to parallel park this monster. \u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything. Tell me about your home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot to tell,\u201d Reese said. \u201cI live with my father in the city. Our house is nothing like Rosethorn, but it\u2019s nice, and the neighborhood where we are is quiet. When I\u2019m there I work with him in the garden. He still grows his own vegetables and flowers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe is...retired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the most part.\u201d Reese felt a kind of distant wonder at how easily she could lie about Ennis. Maybe she could because the truth about him\u2014about them\u2014was so unbelievable. \u201cHe does some work from home. He\u2019s also a book collector, so he\u2019s always going to auctions and estate sales, and looking for little out-of-the-way shops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love to read. I taught Sylas how, our second year together.\u201d Rebecca looked at the empty road ahead of them. \u201cHe never learned as a boy, but then, few did in our time. He was so proud that he insisted on reading the Holy Scriptures to me, from start to finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll in one night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank heaven,\u201d Rebecca said. \u201cIt took him the better part of a year. Then there came the questions. Who was Cain\u2019s wife? How could Noah and his small family repopulate the world after the flood by themselves? If the torment of man was Satan\u2019s work, then why would God do the same to Job?\u201d She made a helpless gesture. \u201cI thought for a time he would drive me mad. Soon after, happily, he took to reading the Greeks.\u201d</p><p>The heaviness of Rebecca\u2019s scent had retreated, Reese noticed, and she seemed much calmer. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTired now.\u201d The chatelaine squinted against the sunlight. \u201cIs it much farther?\u201d</p><p>Reese saw the Atlanta skyline ahead of them. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there.\u201d</p><p>She drove directly to the Armstrong building, parking the stolen truck in the back by the loading platform. As soon as she got out of the cab, a man came out of the receiving office and called to her.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, this is a private building,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t park that here.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went to the signet ring on his right hand, which had onyx and ivory stones engraved with a cameo of Robin of Locksley\u2019s profile. \u201cI am tresori,\u201d she told the man, and showed him the cameo tattoo on the inside of her wrist. \u201cThere is a Kyn female with me. We have to see Will Scarlet at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is not here, sister,\u201d the man told her. \u201cHe left at dawn for Rosethorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Reese felt as if she\u2019d been slapped. \u201cWhy? He cannot lay siege to the stronghold by himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be alone, sister,\u201d the tresora said. \u201cBefore he left, the seneschal summoned the suzerain from the south. They are bringing two hundred of their best, and will join him there by nightfall.\u201d</p><p>Reese glanced back at the truck and saw through the windshield that Rebecca had fallen asleep. If Will had left the book behind, she could retrieve it now and be done with this. If he had taken it with him, she would have to return to the stronghold.</p><p>\u201cI have to go up to the penthouse to look for something I might have left there,\u201d she told the tresora. \u201cWill you watch over the lady while I am gone?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>Suzeraina Jayr mac Byrne lifted high-powered binoculars to her eyes and surveyed the camp a half mile away. \u201cWill and his people have taken position in the trees.\u201d</p><p>Her husband and seneschal, Aedan, spoke softly into his handheld radio. \u201cBeau, you and your men hold the road here. Harlech, divide yours and move to the east and west approaches. Farlae, you and yours wait here.\u201d</p><p>Behind them, one hundred warriors split into four separate groups and silently dispersed.</p><p>Jayr turned to her tracker, who was still crouched on the ground, his eyes closed and his face curiously blank. \u201cWhat can you tell me, Rain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is colder here than Orlando,\u201d the tracker complained. \u201cI should have listened to Farlae and brought my furs.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together. \u201cI meant, what can you tell me about the Italians who came here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are seventy or so. They left their vehicle behind and went in on foot, in formation. Wait.\u201d He opened his eyes and turned his head, nodding at a thicket. \u201cFive carried a great weight in there and returned lighter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA body?\u201d Aedan asked.</p><p>The hulking tracker gently touched an almost invisible footprint on the road, pinched a bit of soil from one side of it, and brought it to his nose. \u201cNo. Burlap. Twine.\u201d He sneezed twice and scowled. \u201cCopper and steel.\u201d He looked up at Jayr. \u201cI think they brought many swords, my lady. They had them bundled like potatoes. Then they came back for them.\u201d</p><p>She held out her hand to Rain and helped him to his feet. \u201cI want you to scout the boundaries of the property. I need to know who has walked through here in the last week.\u201d</p><p>Farlae, a shorter, slim male with fair hair, joined them. His eye, flawed by an enormous black mote, glittered with malice. \u201cSomeone was careless.\u201d He offered Jayr a copper dagger of ornate design. \u201c\u2019Twas made in the fourteenth century. The owner is Kyn, likely female, and recently traveled over seawater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFemale?\u201d Aedan echoed. \u201cYou can see that on the blade?\u201d</p><p>Farlae nodded at the blade. \u201cThere is sea spray on the hilt, and a chip of pink nail polish near the pommel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever she is, she used it last on a mortal,\u201d Rain said, disgusted. \u201cThe smell of blood still clings to it. Throw it away, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe may need it as proof later.\u201d She handed the dagger off to one of her guards before she patted the tracker\u2019s shoulder. \u201cStay with Farlae and the others. Aedan and I will walk ahead to the camp.\u201d</p><p>Although it was customary for a Kyn seneschal to walk behind his lord paramount, Aedan led the way toward the encampment. He served Jayr faithfully as her second, but she was his sygkenis, and in dangerous situations protecting her came first. Yet when they arrived at the edge of the camp, Aedan stepped back to stand at her side, and kept silent as she addressed the guards.</p><p>\u201cI am Suzeraina Jayr mac Byrne, summoned here by Will Scarlet, seneschal to Robin of Locksley. My men and I await his orders.\u201d</p><p>The guards bowed and one trotted off, returning a few moments later with a Kyn male dressed in a red mantle.</p><p>\u201cLady mac Byrne.\u201d Will bowed deeply before he offered his hand to Aedan. \u201cLord mac Byrne. I am grateful beyond words for your quick response.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStow the gratitude and the speeches, lad,\u201d Byrne said as he clasped forearms with Will. \u201cTell us how we may help.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cCome with me and I\u2019ll brief you together on the situation.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They followed Will to the largest tent in the center of camp, which he had set up to serve as a command post. Maps and building plans lay spread out atop crates filled with stores and weapons.</p><p>\u201cThe Italians were sent here to infiltrate the household,\u201d Will said. \u201cTheir mistress, Contessa Salvatora Borgiana, played the refugee and begged sanctuary for herself and them from Lord Locksley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn inventive ruse,\u201d Aedan murmured. \u201cHow many?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOver seventy cavalieri, led by a mar\u00e9chal who calls himself Saetta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA stablemaster?\u201d Jayr\u2019s brows rose. \u201cI think not.\u201d</p><p>Aedan uttered a grim laugh. \u201c\u2019Twas common once to bring in an experienced war master but call him cook or armorer or even groom. Whoever this Saetta is, I\u2019ll wager that he knows siegecraft better than horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last thing a siege lord does is announce himself on the field of battle,\u201d an insolent voice said from the opening of the tent. The big, blond man who stepped inside wore a heavy black cloak over modified battle armor. \u201cIt spoils the surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuzerain Lucan.\u201d Will quickly performed a respectful bow. \u201cThank for you coming so quickly. You know Suzeraina Jayr, and her seneschal, Aedan mac Byrne.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do.\u201d Lucan\u2019s silver eyes shifted to Byrne\u2019s tattooed visage. \u201cHello, Highlander. When last we met, you were planning to siege my stronghold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, lad.\u201d The Scotsman offered him a narrow smile. \u201cI but came to watch Cyprien take your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now I serve him. Perhaps decapitation would have been kinder.\u201d Lucan turned to Jayr. \u201cSuzeraina.\u201d He inspected her from head to toe. \u201cMy. You\u2019ve changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexandra Keller,\u201d she said, as if that explained it all.</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Lucan grinned. \u201cI adore that woman.\u201d</p><p>Will gestured to the table. \u201cWe are just assessing the situation, my lord. Will you join us?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBy all means.\u201d He made a languid gesture. \u201cAssess.\u201d</p><p>Jayr paid close attention as Will Scarlet detailed Rosethorn\u2019s fortifications and the layout of the interior areas of the stronghold. She had visited Robin of Locksley\u2019s country home many times, and had a general working knowledge of the property, but the additional, hidden defenses she had not been aware of proved worrisome and rather mystifying.</p><p>\u201cWhy did Locksley need to make this place into such a fortress?\u201d Byrne said, giving voice to her own thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWhen we dwelled in Sherwood, we had the entire forest at our disposal,\u201d Will said. \u201cOur enemies were never able to find us. Here, sitting out in the open, I think my lord felt exposed. He wanted to ensure that if we were attacked, the jardin would have every measure of defense possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich now the Italians will use against us,\u201d Lucan said. \u201cIn the midst of his paranoia, did Rob ever install more modern security devices? Sensors, cameras?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we survive this, I shall have to send my gadgetry people to advise him.\u201d The suzerain helped himself to a glass of blood wine. \u201cThey have wired every inch of my club. A mortal cannot sneeze within fifty yards of the place that I do not know about it.\u201d He glanced at Jayr. \u201cYou have said very little, my lady. What are your thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am thinking that we have two hundred men between us,\u201d Jayr said. \u201cWhen our stores are exhausted, we will have to begin sending off groups to hunt. With no mortals within thirty miles, and only small populations within a hundred, they will have to be gone at least eight hours. If we hold them here too long, some of them will not wait for leave to go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStarvation and desertion, the two plagues of the besieger.\u201d Lucan studied the wine in his glass. \u201cLocksley should have built his castle somewhere more convenient. I daresay you shall never face these problems in Orlando, suzeraina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we face them now.\u201d Jayr thought for a moment. \u201cPerhaps we could parley with this Italian. Offer him blood stores for him and his men in exchange for the hostages. At the very least he should agree to release the mortals he holds. In the old days they would often send out children, the sick, and the elderly to cross the lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mortals are his stores, my lady,\u201d Will said bitterly. \u201cHe will keep them alive as long as he can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a two-to-one advantage,\u201d Byrne said. \u201cAll we need is a way in unseen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they follow the old ways, which I am quite certain they do, they will patrol the battlements and keep snipers at the windows from dusk till dawn,\u201d Lucan reminded him. \u201cOnce we reveal our presence they will be expecting us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could tunnel in under the curtain wall here,\u201d Will said, pointing to the blueprints. \u201cCome up under the middle ward and split the shaft east and west. Our men to the west emerge behind the tower and block the postern there. To the east, they come up in the chapel and enter the tower through the processional passage.\u201d</p><p>Jayr studied the prints. \u201cYou mean to drive them from the tower into the gallery toward the postern.\u201d</p><p>Will nodded. \u201cThere the men sent to the west will be waiting for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fighting space will be too damned confined,\u201d Lucan argued.</p><p>\u201cNot for single combat,\u201d Will said. \u201cOnce we trap them inside, I will challenge Saetta in front of all his men to a duel of three.\u201d</p><p>Byrne scowled. \u201cWhat the devil is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis an English tradition, you tattooed heathen. The combatants are permitted to use against each other but three jabs of the lance, three thrusts of the dagger, and three strokes of the battle-ax. Whoever has a limb left to stand on, wins.\u201d Lucan smiled a little. \u201cI do miss the old days. Terribly. So how long do we have to dig this tunnel?\u201d</p><p>Will hadn\u2019t considered the time involved. \u201cWe have to be in position by tomorrow night. If I have not received word from Rob by then, we are to attack.\u201d</p><p>Byrne studied the map. \u201cEven if we had the equipment, and sent in the miners to work night and day, we\u2019d need at least four days to tunnel through. We need another way in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr someone on the inside.\u201d Lucan lifted his glass to stare at its contents. \u201cI have an idea.\u201d</p><p>In the place between flesh and spirit, Sylas of Daven walked, aware but not aware, himself and not himself. He had often retreated into the shadows, leaving behind his body as he became one with the darkness. Never had he stayed so long, and as he felt more of himself becoming part of the nothingness, he knew he had to return, at least briefly, to regain his strength and reclaim his soul.</p><p>The pain of parting was nothing to that of reunion, and as he sank over his body he felt the cold bite and burn into him like countless needles of copper. His first breath was agony, and he sank his fangs into his lip to keep himself silent.</p><p>The warm scent of mortal blood beckoned to him, promising relief, and he opened his eyes to find himself on the floor of a holding cell. He turned over and saw the battered face of a dark mortal over him.</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard you move.\u201d Strong hands helped him up into a sitting position, and a red-rimmed eye peered at him, the other swollen shut. \u201cNow, would you mind telling me where the hell I am and why I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>Sylas didn\u2019t recognize the man, but he smelled of the city. \u201cWe are being held prisoner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat much I figured out on my own.\u201d</p><p>With a grunt Sylas rose, accepting the man\u2019s support as he found his footing. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent Raymond Hutchins, Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u201d He surveyed Sylas. \u201cYou escape from a costume party, Romeo?\u201d</p><p>Sylas glanced down at his garments. \u201cOf sorts. I am Sylas. How long have I been unconscious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouple of hours at least.\u201d Hutchins paced around the cell, pausing here and there to test one of the copper bars. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any cops around, and this isn\u2019t like any holding cell I\u2019ve ever seen. It looks like a damn dungeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Sylas looked up at the light fixture, which barely illuminated the shadows. \u201cAgent Hutchins\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Hutch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHutch.\u201d He pointed to the floor. \u201cI need you to stand here, in the light, and close your eyes.\u201d</p><p>The mortal scowled. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you do what I say, I can free both of us.\u201d He saw the skepticism in the other man\u2019s black eyes. \u201cOr we can wait for our captors to come and do as they like with us.\u201d</p><p>Muttering under his breath, Hutch came and stood beneath the light.</p><p>\u201cKeep your eyes closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a welding torch in here I don\u2019t know about?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>The mortal closed his eyes. As soon as he did, Sylas went to the bars and reached out to the shadows beyond them. As soon as the darkness covered his hand, he used his talent, shifting from one shadow to the other, until he stood on the other side of the bars.</p><p>He found that the wall cabinet where the keys were kept had been emptied, but no one had discovered the copies he had hidden beneath one of the floor stones. He used them to unlock the door to the cell.</p><p>\u201cYou can open your eyes,\u201d he said as the door creaked open.</p><p>Hutchins didn\u2019t move. \u201cNice trick, Houdini. How did you squeeze the bars like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am quite flexible.\u201d Sylas saw that the mortal wasn\u2019t going to cooperate. \u201cI am also leaving, Hutch. Come with me or stay here.\u201d</p><p>Hutchins came out of the cell, checking the area around them before nodding toward the left. \u201cI heard some voices back there. They came and brought out a man in chains.\u201d</p><p>Sylas breathed in but didn\u2019t detect any strange scents. \u201cStay behind me.\u201d</p><p>The largest of the detention cells beneath Rosethorn had been designed to hold a small army. Most of the garrison occupied it, all standing in circles within circles to afford the best opportunity of protection. As soon as the men saw Sylas and the mortal, they broke formation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSylas.\u201d Eregen, one of his senior men, came to the bars. \u201cWe feared you were dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am well. Who did they take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaglan.\u201d</p> <p>Sylas saw that the men had been stripped of their weapons. \u201cHow long have the guards been gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive minutes at most.\u201d</p><p>They would be returning soon, and probably not with Raglan. Sylas unlocked the cell door, but held up his hand when Eregen would have pushed it open. \u201cWait. Send out two men to occupy our cell. Have them sit back in the shadows until the guards come, and then follow them in here. You should be able to take them without trouble or alerting those above.\u201d</p><p>Eregen nodded. \u201cWe need weapons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse the women\u2019s passage, and go to the bathhouse. I will send down what I can.\u201d He turned and saw the mortal watching them. \u201cThis is Agent Hutchins. He was taken by the cavalieri from the city, doubtless as part of this scheme. Unless he throws his lot in with Saetta, he is to be regarded as an ally.\u201d He looked at the angry faces of the men of the garrison. \u201cKeep your tempers checked. When we have taken back what is ours, then there will be the time for proper reckoning.\u201d</p> <p>To his credit, Hutchins said nothing until he had followed Sylas out to the stairwell. \u201cIs this some kind of reenactment thing? You boys think you\u2019re Knights of the Round Table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was never a round table.\u201d Sylas checked the stairwell before mounting the steps. \u201cArthur\u2019s knights held council on their feet, surrounding their lord. Be quiet.\u201d</p><p>Sylas waited at the top of the stairs for the patrol guard to pass him before he reached out and grabbed the man, clamping a hand over his mouth. \u201cTake the pistol and sword from him.\u201d</p><p>Hutchins snatched the gun, but couldn\u2019t work the sword free of the sheath. He tried to club the guard over the head with the butt of the pistol.</p><p>\u201cThat will not work,\u201d Sylas said. \u201cYou must shoot him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not killing this man\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt will not kill him.\u201d Sylas plucked the pistol from Hutchins\u2019s hand, pressed it to the guard\u2019s neck, and pulled the trigger. The cartridge of blue liquid lodged halfway into his neck, and the guard fell like a stone.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a tranquilizer gun,\u201d the mortal said blankly. His eyes widened when Sylas pulled the empty cartridge from the wound in the guard\u2019s flesh, which immediately healed over. Then he looked up. \u201cWhat kind of drugs did you put in me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d Sylas handed him the gun and bent to retrieve the man\u2019s sword. \u201cYou see? The sheath is made to hold the blade secure. You must draw it up before you pull it back. Remember that.\u201d</p><p>The gun appeared in Sylas\u2019s face. \u201cTell me what this is. What he is, what you are. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were taken prisoner by a group of renegades who invaded our stronghold,\u201d Sylas said. \u201cWe are called Darkyn. We are not human. We cannot be easily killed. I can tell you the rest of our history, but I doubt I will manage more than a few centuries\u2019 worth before we are discovered.\u201d</p><p>Hutchins made a disgusted sound. \u201cThey must have pumped you full of drugs, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will give you proof.\u201d Sylas used the copper dagger to slash his palm, and then held it so Hutchins could watch the wound heal. \u201cWhen there is time, I will explain the rest. For now, I need you to trust me and follow my orders, or we will be captured. If that happens, they will not spare our lives again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d The mortal regarded him steadily. \u201cYou might be crazy as a bedbug, but you got me out of that cell. I\u2019m willing to go on a little faith. What\u2019s next?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe need to retrieve weapons for my men. It will require us to move through occupied areas of the house. You must go ahead of me, and when you confront anyone, behave as if you are addled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAddled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrugged. Disoriented. Lost.\u201d Sylas dragged the guard\u2019s body behind some crates. \u201cWhile you distract the Italians, I will deal with them. Whatever you do, stay in the light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, I\u2019m not afraid of the dark.\u201d</p><p>Sylas handed him a dagger. \u201cIn this place, you have to be.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>Reese searched Robin\u2019s penthouse, tearing it apart in the process, but the book was nowhere to be found. She knew that Will wouldn\u2019t have left it behind unguarded, but she had to be sure. After breaking into Robin\u2019s vault room and searching through his most priceless treasures, she went to the phone and called her father.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not here,\u201d she said, and explained what had happened since her last report. \u201cScarlet must have taken it with him to Rosethorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that is where you will go.\u201d</p><p>She sat down on the edge of Robin\u2019s bed. \u201cFather, this can\u2019t continue. He is already suspicious of me. If I show up there without cause\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe cares for you,\u201d Ennis reminded her. \u201cYou must use that affection. Convince him that you were afraid for him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am afraid for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and seduce him. When he sleeps, take the book and leave.\u201d He waited for her to reply. \u201cOr kill him and take it. Perhaps his death will at last free you from your guilt. He was the one who did this to you, child. Or have you forgotten that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor my sins, I have tried to repent,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cI have given my life into your hands. I have done your work. I have never complained. When will it be enough, Father? When will my penance end?\u201d</p><p>His voice chilled. \u201cYou ask me for your freedom? Now, when we are so close?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. Without the work\u2014without Father\u2014she had nothing. No one would care what happened to her. Not even Will.</p><p>\u201cBring the book to me,\u201d he said, \u201cand I will release you from your vow.\u201d</p><p>They had never spoken of this, not since the night in the graveyard. Although it was everything that she wanted, she felt a perverse curiosity. \u201cWhy free me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have earned it.\u201d</p><p>She took the cigarette case from her bag and opened it. Four vials of blood remained, along with one black vial. The last, filled with poison, she carried in the event she was ever captured by their enemies. Her father carried one just like it.</p><p>She had to drag the words out. \u201cI will go to Rosethorn now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod watches over you, child.\u201d</p><p>Reese left the penthouse and returned to the loading platform, but saw no sign of the truck. Instead, a large recreational vehicle stood parked in its place.</p><p>\u201cOur friends in the police department warned us that the truck you drove was reported stolen,\u201d the tresora told her. \u201cI had my men remove it. The lady is resting in the back of the camper.\u201d</p><p>Reese eyed the large vehicle. \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot well,\u201d he said. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t let anyone come near her. Do you need directions to the sanctuary house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d She pulled the strap of her bag over her shoulder. \u201cI know where I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>Saetta stood at the ravelin atop the main house and looked out at the surrounding property. The stronghold\u2019s central observation post offered a commanding view of the outlying lawns, but nothing past the tree lines. By trapping Locksley\u2019s jardin inside Rosethorn, he had eliminated the immediate threat of a counterattack. However, his lady had warned him that reinforcements were likely to arrive within the first day.</p><p>\u201cI have seen not a glimmer of light, mar\u00e9chal,\u201d the guard on duty assured him.</p><p>\u201cThey will not use light, or fire, where it might be seen from the house.\u201d He handed the binoculars to the guard. As luck would have it, the wind was coming from the north, blowing from the back of the property to the front and eradicating any scent they might have otherwise detected. \u201cSignal me if you suspect an approach.\u201d</p><p>As Saetta returned downstairs to the main hall, a subtle uneasiness crept over him. The house was secure, and no more guards had been attacked by mysterious shadow demons, but something was not right. The silence of the passages seemed too absolute. The air rang with soundless whispers. If he were a superstitious man, he would swear that the house itself watched him with cold, unseen eyes.</p><p>\u201cBernardo, attend me.\u201d When the captain of the cavalieri came to him, Saetta said, \u201cChange the guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, mar\u00e9chal. Which guard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll.\u201d</p><p>Bernardo frowned. \u201cWe have three hours before the next rotation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone who has been watching us will know that,\u201d Saetta said. \u201cThey will seek to take advantage of it. Change them all, at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, mar\u00e9chal.\u201d</p><p>Saetta went to an adjoining room, where his two best interrogators were still questioning the Kyn taken from the cells. Spatters of blood stained the floor and the prisoner\u2019s clothes, but he remained still and watchful.</p><p>\u201cWhat progress have you made?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says nothing, mar\u00e9chal.\u201d Domion pulled off his gauntlets and slipped spiked copper knuckle guards over his fingers. \u201cI think he will soon change his mind.\u201d</p><p>Saetta crouched in front of the sullen warrior. \u201cOne of your jardin attacked my guards. He took one of my men. Until he is returned, and the Kyn who did this named, you will suffer in his place.\u201d He saw the hatred in the man\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou cannot prevail.\u201d</p><p>The warrior smiled, showing bloodied teeth, and then spit in Saetta\u2019s face. With a curse Domion slammed his fist into the prisoner\u2019s chest, puncturing it with his spiked knuckles. The warrior doubled over as far as his bonds would allow, coughed several times, and then slowly straightened.</p><p>\u201cHe will take you,\u201d the warrior promised in a low, menacing voice. \u201cOne by one, you will go. You cannot stop him.\u201d</p><p>Saetta seized the front of the prisoner\u2019s tunic. \u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster of shadows.\u201d His eyes closed, and he sagged, unconscious. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGive him time to heal,\u201d Saetta said as he straightened. \u201cThen begin again, and do not stop until he talks or he dies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you command, mar\u00e9chal.\u201d</p><p>Saetta went to the kitchens, where he washed the blood and saliva from his face. Darkyn did not eat food, so to him the room was a waste of space, but he imagined the Americans pampered the mortals who served them. He could easily imagine the pretty wife of Sylas, working over a breadboard, her sleeves folded back, her slim hands shaping dough. In his human life, he had loved to watch his wife work in the kitchen. Even when he had been hired by the Medicis, and had more money than he had known how to spend, she had refused to hire a cook. Making food for the family was the work of a wife, she always claimed.</p> <p>\u201cMar\u00e9chal,\u201d someone said behind him.</p><p>Saetta dried his dripping face and turned. \u201cWhat is it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis the prisoners we put below,\u201d the lieutenant said. \u201cThey have escaped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich prisoners?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of them, mar\u00e9chal.\u201d</p> <p>Reese took the camper to a public underground garage and parked it there. She was exhausted, and if she were going to finish this thing she had to sleep. Cautiously she went into the back to check on Rebecca, who had curled up on one of the camper\u2019s bunks and appeared to be in the deep, still state that passed for sleep among the Kyn. But as she turned to make her way back toward the front of the camper, the chatelaine called her name, startling her so much she dropped her bag.</p><p>Rebecca looked over the side of the bunk. \u201cForgive me. I didn\u2019t intend to scare you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Reese told her, bending down to pick up her things. \u201cI\u2019ve found a safe place to park for a while. We\u2019re going to stay here until sunset.\u201d</p><p>The chatelaine reached down and picked up Reese\u2019s wallet. \u201cDo you carry photos in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one.\u201d Reese took the wallet, unfolded it, and showed her the picture tucked under the clear plastic. \u201cThat\u2019s my father.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca frowned. \u201cHe\u2019s dressed like a priest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was a priest, before he...left the church.\u201d She closed the wallet and finished gathering her things. \u201cRest now. In a few hours we\u2019ll be back at Rosethorn, and we\u2019ll find Sylas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSylas.\u201d Rebecca\u2019s eyes closed. \u201cHe\u2019s in the shadows.\u201d</p><p>Being in the darkest part of the garage helped block the sunlight and gave an illusion of night, but Reese still couldn\u2019t rest. Given Rebecca\u2019s uncertain mental state, sleeping close to the chatelaine seemed unwise, so she returned to the front of the camper. She lowered the driver\u2019s seat back as far as it would go and turned on her side, trying to make herself comfortable, but her stomach felt shriveled and her head pounded unpleasantly. Finally she grabbed her bag, removed one of the vials, and, with a glance back at Rebecca, drank from it. Only then was she was able to close her eyes and fall into a deep sleep.</p><p>The dream that came over her took her into a shabby room lit only by candles and the flames from a fireplace. There were two people sitting at a table, one dressed in priest\u2019s robes, the other a rude-looking peasant man with a powerful build. A candle and two mugs sat between them.</p><p>Reese tried to turn and leave, but the dream held her fast.</p><p>\u201cPater Noster, que es in calis, sanctific\u00fae nomen tuum,\u201d the priest said, and then waited for the peasant to respond.</p><p>\u201cAdveni\u00e1te regnum tuum,\u201d the villein muttered. \u201cFiat vol\u00fantas tua, sicut in caelo et in terra.\u201d</p><p>The priest nodded. \u201cYou see, my child? You can remember the words, when you try.\u201d</p> <p>The peasant held his head in his hands. \u201cRemember. Words.\u201d He lashed out with his arm, knocking the two mugs from the table. \u201cForget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod wants you to remember words,\u201d the priest said. \u201cHe wants you never to forget again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d The peasant gripped his own shirt in his fists. \u201cNot me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would give you back what you have lost, child, but it is not meant to be.\u201d He eased the peasant\u2019s hands away from the shredded shirt and held them. \u201cGod has given you an enormous gift. It is a miracle. You can be anyone you wish to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d Tears rolled down the man\u2019s face. \u201cI want me.\u201d</p><p>Reese rushed toward the table. \u201cKill him,\u201d she shouted at the priest. \u201cKill him now.\u201d She passed through the table, her body like that of a ghost. \u201cGod, please, don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will find a woman for you,\u201d the priest was saying. \u201cOne who pleases you. Then we will continue with our work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoman. Work.\u201d The peasant swiped at his eyes. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Reese was torn from the room and into another, this one lit by electric lights. The priest sat at a table with six other men and one woman, a scroll rolled out before them.</p><p>\u201cThe prophecy of Beatrice says that the book will remain hidden until just after the turn of this century, when it will be used against the mortal world,\u201d one of the men said. \u201cThe colonies of the new world where it is said it will reappear must be the United States, and from our calculations, the month will be April of next year. But who is the smiling thief and the dark lord, and which one will take the book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobin of Locksley and Guy of Guisbourne.\u201d The priest rolled up the scroll. \u201cLocksley has been made a lord paramount. Guisbourne fled to America a few months ago. Both of them, in fact, will take the book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it has begun,\u201d one of the men murmured. \u201cThe end of days, just as she said.\u201d</p><p>Another of the men leaned back and folded his arms. \u201cFather, how can we trust the predictions made by a demented witch burned at the stake six hundred years ago?\u201d \u201cShe was not demented, nor a witch,\u201d the priest said. \u201cShe was Darkyn, and her talent was foresight.\u201d He looked at the faces around him. \u201cThe moment is at hand, and the fate of all humanity rests with us.\u201d</p><p>Reese saw the priest produce a photograph, one of a smiling young woman with laughing dark eyes, and hand it to the woman at the table. Reese shook her head as she watched the woman study the picture.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d she whispered, even though she knew she couldn\u2019t hear her. \u201cTell him no. Say he must choose another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have no difficulty with her,\u201d the woman said.</p><p>The priest nodded. \u201cOur investigators say that she works in an advertising agency in the city, she lives alone, and she has no friends outside the tresori.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConvenient.\u201d She looked up at the others. \u201cOnce I take over, you cannot contact me. I will report only to Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is something else you should know, my child,\u201d the priest said, and touched her arm. \u201cThe woman has been seen in the company of Robin of Locksley\u2019s seneschal, Will Scarlet.\u201d</p><p>The photo dropped out of the woman\u2019s fingers even as Reese was pushed out of the dream and into the dark. Afraid and alone, she called out for Will. When he came, she tried to reach him, but she couldn\u2019t see him. She began to babble, telling him everything she had kept secret, but then she felt him drawing away.</p><p>The connection between her and Will snapped, and snapped again, and then a third time, until all she could hear was a sharp rapping.</p><p>Reese opened her eyes and turned over to see a security guard tapping the handle of a nightstick against the driver\u2019s-side window. She sat up and opened it.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t sleep in here, miss,\u201d the man said. \u201cLeave the vehicle or leave the lot, one or the other.\u201d</p><p>She looked at her watch and saw the time. The sun would be setting in a few minutes. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>She started the engine and backed out of the space.</p><p>Will knew he had to rest. Jayr had admonished him before retiring to her tent with mac Byrne, and even Lucan had advised him that the quickest way to lose a duel was to spend the night before it awake. As the sun rose, he sent his men to their bedrolls, issued orders to the tresori who would be standing watching during the day, and at last retreated to his tent.</p><p>It had been several years since he had been obliged to sleep on the ground, but he had ordered that the few camp beds available be placed in their allies\u2019 tents. The ground was hard and the blankets rough, but as soon as he stretched out on the bedroll his tired body went limp with relief. He would have to rise early and feed before the others woke, he thought, and closed his eyes.</p><p>Red, if you are not too mad, I would beg your forgiveness.</p><p>Will stood before the gibbet and the hangman, but this time they were all alone. That April morning, when his mortal life had ended, had turned to a night of ill wind and cold, distant stars.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have tormented you that day.\u201d Robin of Locksley removed the black hood covering his handsome face. \u201cHave you ever forgiven me for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t break my neck, master,\u201d Will reminded him. \u201cYou saved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still cheated all those fine folk of their spectacle. Or, rather, you did.\u201d Rob cuffed the back of his head. \u201cFive hundred mortals you sent to sleep that day, with only a thought.\u201d</p><p>Will looked over at the empty road, and remembered the shock of seeing all the bodies of the townspeople piled on either side of it. \u201cA pity my talent doesn\u2019t work on the Kyn.\u201d</p><p>Robin produced a black book. \u201cNot to worry. It\u2019ll be quick, lad.\u201d</p><p>The dreamlands often distorted things in the same way mortal dreams did, but always with a purpose. \u201cWhy have you come to me, Rob? What am I to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d His master opened the book and showed him the blank pages. \u201cYou have served me well, Will Scarlet. You have been my good friend. But in all these years, you have asked for nothing for yourself. You have lived my life, not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am your seneschal, my lord. My life is yours.\u201d Will didn\u2019t know what else to say. \u201cRob, are you in trouble?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI am beyond trouble. I have fallen in love with a mortal.\u201d Robin laughed. \u201cSo have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReese and I are friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were. Not anymore.\u201d He went to the gibbet and tore down the hangman\u2019s noose, placing it around his own neck. \u201cI have ever had the luck of a fool, but this time I have the feeling that it has run out. I do not believe I will see you again, Liam of Aubury.\u201d He tightened the slipknot. \u201cYou will look after Rosethorn and our people for me?\u201d</p><p>Will went to him and tried to pull the knot loose, but it held tightly. \u201cYou are Robin of the Hood. You are a legend. Legends do not die. Do not call me Liam, and give me this bloody rope.\u201d</p> <p>A black wool hood dropped over his head, shutting out the sight of his master trying to hang himself. He could not speak or move, but he heard Robin take in his last breath. He felt the rope biting into his neck just as it tightened around his master\u2019s. This time, the roar of fury inside his head was for the man who had saved him, whom he could no longer save.</p><p>Bright spots of eerie light danced on the insides of his eyelids, and Will heard Robin\u2019s heart begin to slow. Just as fear and outrage were about to swallow his mind, something hissed into his ear and the hood was torn away. He fell, landing with a brutal thud facedown in the cold dirt, his wrist snapping under the weight of his body.</p><p>The little wooden cross fell from his limp fingers into the dirt.</p><p>Rob, Will thought, gasping in precious air and trying to push himself up onto his feet. He would not see Robin of Locksley cut down the middle and torn to pieces by four horses. He would rather take Robin\u2019s place than allow his master to spend his last moments on this earth in unimaginable agony. But the rope slowly swaying in the wind was empty, and his master was gone.</p><p>Instead, Reese stood at the gibbet, dressed in Claris of Aubury\u2019s clothes. \u201cYour master is coming for you.\u201d</p> <p>Will knew it was impossible for her to have entered the dreamlands. No mortal could. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone. No one. I had nothing else to give.\u201d She tried to smile, and for a moment she was Clary. \u201c\u2019Twill be forever now. You never came back for me.\u201d</p><p>She might be a ghost of his imagination\u2014a confused one at that\u2014but she was trying to tell him something. Just as Robin had.</p><p>He took a step toward her and felt something under his bare foot. He bent down and found the little wooden cross Claris had given to him. He picked it up out of the dirt and brought it to her.</p><p>Will pressed it into her hands. \u201cThis was your faith in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found it later.\u201d She tugged a chain out from under her ragged overtunic, and the cross vanished from her hands and appeared on the end of the chain. \u201cI kept it for you.\u201d</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t tell if her face was Reese\u2019s or Clary\u2019s; her features kept blurring. \u201cI was the one who made you sick,\u201d he told her. \u201cI came back, but not soon enough. They had already buried you in the graves with all the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Liam.\u201d She smiled and tucked her cross under her collar. \u201cThey waited too long to put me in the ground. I woke when they tried to bury me.\u201d</p><p>Will breathed in and smelled her scent, as sweet and ripe as a field of berries. \u201cYou went through the change.\u201d Horror sank into him. \u201cYou went through the change alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what they do when a body crawls out of an open grave?\u201d She brushed at her hair, and soil fell from it. \u201cThey try to kill it. Do you know what they do when she won\u2019t die?\u201d</p><p>He backed away from her, shaking his head. \u201cYou are not Claris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey put her in a cage, like an animal. They toy with her. They try to feed her offal and shit. Days and weeks and months of it.\u201d Her clothes disappeared, and her body shrank, becoming little more than skin over bones. Filth bloomed over her, mottling her fairness. \u201cThey bleed her and stab her and laugh, oh, Will, they laugh so much, for it is all so amusing, this thing that crawled from the grave, this girl who would not die.\u201d Her hair grew long and matted, falling down the front of her body in snarls. \u201cAnd then, one night, when she has not moved for a week, and they think she is done, they open the cage to drag her out, to burn what\u2019s left of her. They do not know that she has gone mad. That in her madness, she is strong again.\u201d</p><p>Will watched as her body blurred and grew into that of a big, strapping lad in peasant\u2019s clothes.</p><p>\u201cI was the first.\u201d The young man touched the gaping wound in his throat. \u201cBut not the last. There were more. The butcher.\u201d He body changed into a short, bulky form with heavily muscled arms and a ragged hole in his chest. \u201cThe baker.\u201d Her body became thin and lanky, her hands white with flour, her face red with blood. \u201cThe candlestick maker.\u201d Her belly grew, sagging over spindly legs, her neck ending in a stump.</p> <p>Will had to stop this nightmarish procession of bodies. \u201cClaris, is this you? Have you come to me?\u201d</p><p>Her body blurred again, becoming the image of Reese as she had looked when she had come to the bar. \u201cClaris of Aubury died in that cage,\u201d she told him. \u201cThis is all that\u2019s left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot understand you,\u201d Will said. \u201cWhat does this mean? What are you telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was Father who saved me.\u201d She touched the lump the cross had made under her blouse. \u201cIt was always you. I lived for you. I waited for you.\u201d Her eyes grew empty. \u201cBut you never came for me.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her arms and shook her. \u201cReese, where is Claris? How is she doing this? Tell her I must see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will tell her whatever you like,\u201d Lucan said, \u201cbut do stop shouting and shaking me.\u201d</p><p>Will looked around him. He was standing in the center of camp, with his hands clamped around the arms of the deadliest assassin among the Kyn. He dropped his arms and stepped back. \u201cForgive me, my lord. I was in the dreamlands, and I...\u201d Ashamed of his loss of control, he went down on his knees.</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d Lucan brushed at his sleeves. \u201cSomeone summoned you from afar. From the hold you were under, I would wager it was blood Kyn. Perhaps this Claris whose name you were yelling in my face.\u201d He glanced down. \u201cOh, get up, man. I am not going to kill you for wrinkling my jacket. I do not even like it that much. Now, my leather long coat, that I would find harder to forgive. My sygkenis gave that one to me, and I am extremely fond of it.\u201d</p><p>Will slowly rose. \u201cYou are very kind, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am nothing of the sort, but we will argue that point another time.\u201d He nodded toward the east road. \u201cA female mortal has just driven one of those cottages on wheels into camp, and she is asking for you.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>Reese waited by the camper as the camp guards sent for Will. When he came, he stared at her in open disbelief.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart.\u201d He hurried over to her. \u201cI thought you were inside the stronghold. Captured with the others.\u201d He looked her over. \u201cDid they harm you? Are you hurt? How did you get away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one hurt me. Rebecca looked after me. She\u2019s inside the camper.\u201d When he went to the door, she put herself between him and the vehicle. \u201cYou can\u2019t go in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca is one of my oldest friends,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course I\u2019m going in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Will. She\u2019s sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? We do not get sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt started as soon as we escaped Rosethorn.\u201d She led him away from the camper. \u201cShe told me it\u2019s because of the bond she has with Sylas. It\u2019s stronger with them than with other Kyn. Being apart from him hurts her. It makes her talent harder to control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSylas has always refused to be separated from her for more than a day. Now I see why.\u201d Will glanced back at the big vehicle. \u201cHow far gone is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Reese admitted. \u201cShe pulled the partition shut just before we arrived here. She said I shouldn\u2019t let anyone in there but her husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot say whether Sylas is dead or alive.\u201d Will thrust a hand through his hair. \u201cWe are preparing to move on the Italians tonight.\u201d</p><p>The door to the camper abruptly opened, startling both of them. Rebecca had changed out of her gown into men\u2019s clothing, and she carried a golf club. She didn\u2019t look at Will or Reese, but stared directly at Rosethorn.</p><p>\u201cThey have hurt him,\u201d she said, her expression contorted, \u201cbut my husband lives.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at the hand Will put over the fist she had wrapped around the club, and then turned her gaze on him. \u201cThe last man who put his hand on me I left lying in a ditch and bleeding from the ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not stop you,\u201d he said, carefully removing his hand. \u201cYou may go in there and get yourself and Sylas killed. If that is your wish.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca drew in a deep breath and looked at him again, this time making a visible effort to focus on his features. \u201cI beg your pardon, Will. I am not...myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is naught to forgive.\u201d He put his arm around her. \u201cBecca, I know what this is doing to you, and if there were any way I could put an end to it, I would. But Sylas and all our friends are in there, and they are in desperate need of your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy help.\u201d Her laugh sounded bitter. \u201cIf I use my talent, no one will be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that your bond allows you to see through Sylas\u2019s eyes,\u201d Will said. \u201cI must know what is happening inside the stronghold.\u201d</p><p>She dragged herself away from him, her attention once more on Rosethorn.</p><p>\u201cRebecca.\u201d Reese started after her.</p><p>\u201cLeave her,\u201d Will said, tugging her back. \u201cLet her try.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca\u2019s back tensed and her limbs locked as the scent of burning honey grew thick. \u201cHe is in the shadows,\u201d she said, her words a thin thread of sound. \u201cNear the arsenal below the north terrace. He has hidden a mortal on the fighting platform above. The Moor they brought with them. There are others. He freed the garrison.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Will came around to watch her face. \u201cWhat is Sylas doing, Rebecca?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalking among them.\u201d She smiled a little. \u201cThey do not know. They cannot see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you make yourself known to him? Can you tell him we\u2019re here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe knows.\u201d Her voice grew dreamy. \u201cHe is waiting for the guard to change. When they do, he will give the order.\u201d Her eyes, closed until now, flew open. \u201cReese?\u201d</p><p>Reese came to stand beside the chatelaine and put an arm around her. \u201cI\u2019m here, Rebecca.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca began shaking her head. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. It cannot be. No priest would...\u201d She stared down at Reese in horror. \u201cReese?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d she said, and staggered as Rebecca fell against her. \u201cWill, help me with her.\u201d</p><p>Will lifted Rebecca into his arms and peered at her face. \u201cShe\u2019s unconscious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe strain must have been too much.\u201d When he moved as if to carry her to the tents, Reese added, \u201cYou should put her back in the camper. Do you have any chains?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not putting my friend\u2019s wife in manacles,\u201d he snapped, turning away.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what her talent is?\u201d she countered.</p><p>Surprised, he stopped. \u201cNo. She never uses it or speaks of it to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe makes the living bleed.\u201d Reese lifted her hair and showed him the thin trail of dried blood on her neck. \u201cAnyone who comes near her. Mortal or Darkyn. Animals. Anything alive. She doesn\u2019t have to touch them, either.\u201d</p><p>Will swore softly. \u201cThat is why she never hunts. But how she can live if she does not feed?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSylas has been feeding her from his own veins. She said that her talent doesn\u2019t affect him. Sometimes she uses bagged blood.\u201d She opened the door to the camper. \u201cI\u2019ll stay with her while you go get the chains and some guards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot leave you alone with her,\u201d Will said after he put Rebecca back in the camper. \u201cShe might harm you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019ll be out for a while, but if she wakes up I\u2019ll make a run for the tents.\u201d She put her hand to his cheek. \u201cHurry back.\u201d</p><p>Reese watched Will go before she climbed into the camper. Quickly she discarded the empty pressure dart she had tucked in her sleeve before she went to the unconscious woman.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I had to do that,\u201d she told her, smoothing some of the disheveled hair back from the chatelaine\u2019s face. \u201cBut I can\u2019t fail now, not when I\u2019m this close.\u201d</p><p>She covered Rebecca with the quilt at the end of the tiny bed before she left the camper. She would have to walk out of camp and find a lone guard on patrol. After she used him for what she needed, she\u2019d simply walk back and retrieve the book from Will\u2019s tent.</p><p>Reese glanced back at the camper before she started down the hill. The pines here had thin, almost fragile-looking trunks, but they had been planted so close together they formed a natural barrier to anything except a person on foot. She was glad she\u2019d taken the time to walk several times through the woods along the outside of the property; otherwise she might have lost her way. She didn\u2019t remember smelling jasmine before, though.</p><p>Just as she started after a guard who had walked passed her, a glaring beam of white light found her face, blinding her for a moment.</p> <p>\u201cNow, why,\u201d a lazy voice asked, \u201cwould Will Scarlet\u2019s little mortal lover be skulking about the woods in the midst of a siege?\u201d</p><p>She shaded her eyes with her hand. \u201cI had to relieve myself, my lord.\u201d</p><p>The light beam moved away from her face. \u201cI daresay there are far more adequate facilities for that sort of thing in the back of that monstrosity you just drove into camp.\u201d Suzerain Lucan\u2019s gray eyes took on a metallic gleam. \u201cDo try again.\u201d</p><p>She had no choice but to lie. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d he told her as he took hold of her wrist in a velvet-gloved vise of a hand. \u201cBut I expect we\u2019ll sort it out.\u201d He caught her other arm before she could punch him in the face. \u201cDarling, please don\u2019t wave your delicious-smelling flesh under my nose. I\u2019m in a very bad mood, and I\u2019ve had nothing to eat all day.\u201d</p><p>He brought her wrists behind her back, pinned them there with one hand, and clamped his other hand on her shoulder before he marched her out of the woods.</p><p>Reese saw Will by the camper and panicked.</p><p>Always try to talk your way out, Father\u2019s voice said, ringing in her ears. Do what you must only as a last resort. Remember your vow.</p><p>\u201cI have something that belongs to you,\u201d the Kyn male holding her said to Will. \u201cOr, at least, I thought she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReese?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to wake Rebecca by using the bathroom in the camper,\u201d she said, keeping her tone slightly exasperated. \u201cThe suzerain seems to think I was up to no good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease release her, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d Lucan said, releasing her wrists. \u201cDo you always require an audience when you pee?\u201d He looked at Will. \u201cI caught her sneaking up on one of the patrols.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you haven\u2019t noticed, it\u2019s pretty dark out here, and my night vision is lousy.\u201d She forced out a small laugh. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re making such a big deal out of this. I just needed to\u2014\u201d She broke off and brought up her hand to grab Lucan\u2019s wrist as he attacked her.</p><p>He held the dagger an inch from her left eye. \u201cYour night vision may be poor, darling, but your reflexes are magnificent.\u201d He tugged his hand free and tossed the dagger to Will. \u201cWhoever sent her trained her well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d she snapped. \u201cTresori begin training as soon as they can walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Lucan strolled around her. \u201cBut a real tresora would also know that her scent changes when she lies. Can you smell it now, Will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Will said, his expression stony. \u201cI did before, but I thought her afraid of Rebecca.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is afraid.\u201d Lucan loomed over her, his gaze searching her face. \u201cTerribly afraid. But not of Sylas\u2019s lady. Or of us.\u201d</p><p>Reese whirled and tried to run, but a heavy body slammed into hers, knocking her to the ground. Will flipped her over and put a hand to her throat as a hot sweetness flooded her head.</p><p>Before Reese could draw another breath, she fell into darkness.</p><p>Sylas followed the mortal from the basement level to the first floor of the house, where the dark man waited and listened before making a hand signal to move forward. They crept down one passage until they heard footsteps, and then Sylas stepped into the shadows.</p><p>\u201cRemember,\u201d he murmured to the mortal. \u201cAddled.\u201d</p><p>The dark man hunched over and began to walk in a haphazard fashion, his arms swinging wildly. When two cavalieri came into view, they rushed forward, hands on their sword hilts.</p><p>\u201cHold,\u201d one of them shouted.</p><p>\u201cSomebody hit me over the head,\u201d Hutchins complained, slurring the words. \u201cIs this my mama\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>Sylas passed from one shadow to another, gathering them with his talent until they writhed in a silent, snarling mass. He sent the emptiness out, casting it over one of the guards, whose cry was swallowed along with his flesh. As his clothes and weapon dropped to the floor, the other guard drew his blade.</p><p>\u201cCome out, demon,\u201d he demanded, his voice shaking.</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up.\u201d Hutchins shot him with a dart.</p><p>Sylas emerged from the shadows and recovered their weapons. \u201cYou did well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did better.\u201d Hutchins looked around. \u201cWhere\u2019s the other one, and how did you get him out of his clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shadows took him.\u201d Sylas handed him an ammunition belt loaded with the drug cartridges. \u201cThey will take you as well if you step out of the light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d The mortal laughed. \u201cYou got the bogeyman working for you?\u201d</p><p>Sylas never shared his talent with mortals; it frightened them too much. His men knew\u2014they had fought too many battles with him not to know\u2014but talent was not something Kyn discussed. \u201cI said I would explain later. Come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat thing brushed against me.\u201d Hutchins pulled his sleeve back to reveal a bloody patch on his dark skin. \u201cIt burned like fire, but it was so cold. Now I don\u2019t feel anything.\u201d He touched the wound. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019ve been telling me to stay in the light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Sylas ran a dagger across his palm, then placed his hand over Hutchins\u2019s wound, using his blood to heal it.</p><p>The man jerked, wincing, and then frowned. \u201cYou\u2019d better not have AIDS, my man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no diseases.\u201d Sylas lifted his hand. \u201c\u2019Tis healed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight, \u2019tis healed.\u201d The mortal touched the dark flesh of his arm. \u201cHow the hell did you...I know: You\u2019ll explain it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy men will reach the bathhouse soon,\u201d Sylas said. \u201cWe must go quickly now.\u201d</p><p>They reached the cache of weapons on the second floor without any further confrontations, thanks to a sudden change of the guard.</p><p>\u201cSweet baby Jesus.\u201d Hutchins turned around, staring at the hundreds of swords hanging from the racks. \u201cHow are we are going to carry these out of here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll use this.\u201d Sylas went to the wall and pressed a button on a panel beside a tall steel door, which slid open to reveal a large dumbwaiter. \u201cHelp me load them in.\u201d</p><p>With the mortal\u2019s help Sylas loaded as many blades, daggers, and maces as he could fit into the lift, then used the panel to send it to the first floor. \u201cThis goes directly to the bathhouse. The men will unload it and send it back up for more.\u201d</p><p>Hutchins asked, \u201cYou normally wash your swords in the bath?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe never use that room for bathing. We only make it appear that we do.\u201d Sylas saw the mortal\u2019s drowsy eyes, and realized he was shedding too much scent in the small room. \u201cStep outside for a moment, Hutch. Until your head clears.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d The mortal opened the door and went out, only to come back in almost immediately. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole gang of them at the other end of the hall. I think they saw me.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI think the drugs are kicking back in, too.\u201d</p><p>Sylas barred the door and guided the mortal over to the dumbwaiter, which had returned. \u201cGet in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrother, I can\u2019t leave you here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou must. Tell the men I am going back into the shadows,\u201d Sylas said. \u201cI will do what I can. Stay with Eregen and do as he says.\u201d He clasped Hutchins\u2019s forearm. \u201cThank you, my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d Hutchins grimaced as he climbed into the small space, cramming his body inside. \u201cAll right. Hit it.\u201d</p><p>Sylas watched the door as the dumbwaiter descended. As soon as he heard the pulleys stop, he punched his fist into the control panel, destroying it.</p><p>He stepped into the shadows, where the last thing he saw was the cavalieri forcing in the door.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p> <p>Reese woke up alone, gagged and tied to a tent pole. In the state she was in, she could not break free of her bonds, and even if she could, one of the guards had already searched her and taken away her bag. She was trapped, a mortal at the mercy of the Kyn, and she had run out of lies.</p><p>Will came in and removed his cloak, tossing it over the camp table before he came to stand in front of her. \u201cIf you scream, I will put you to sleep for a week. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He inspected her face before he pulled the gag from her mouth. \u201cHow long have you been working for the Brethren?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed to ease her dry mouth. \u201cI have nothing to do with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who sent you to spy on us?\u201d</p> <p>She had to be careful not to lie. \u201cNo one. I\u2019m not a spy.\u201d She tugged at her wrists. \u201cYou can untie me. I won\u2019t try to run again.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move. \u201cWas it Guisbourne? Did you pledge yourself to him? Did you come to work some vengeance in his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve never met Lord Nottingham. Will, please. I\u2019m not here to hurt anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you have failed.\u201d He turned his back on her and went back to the table.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m telling the truth,\u201d she insisted. \u201cYou know me, Will. You know I wouldn\u2019t betray you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil two nights past, I knew you were a happy, contented woman who enjoyed my company. Who told me that we could never have more than that.\u201d He poured a glass of blood wine and drank it down in three swallows. \u201cYou are not that woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d She closed her eyes and twisted her wrists, but the ropes only tightened. \u201cWhat are you going to do? You can\u2019t keep me tied up here forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think not?\u201d He strode over to her, seizing her face with one hand so that she had no choice but to look into his furious eyes. \u201cI can have you taken from here in chains and tossed into a dark cell and kept there for the rest of your life. One call, Reese, is all I need to make, and you will be gone and forgotten.\u201d</p> <p>He meant to frighten her, but no threat could equal that of the book. \u201cThen make the call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dare taunt me.\u201d He reached behind her and tore the ropes from her wrists, snapping the cords with one jerk. Before she could bring her arms around he dragged her away from the tent pole and over to the thick blankets spread over the ground.</p><p>Reese went limp, but he didn\u2019t let go of her. He hauled her under his arm like a sack of grain and tossed her with the same indifference onto his bed.</p><p>She rolled away, only to find herself trapped, facedown, beneath his body. \u201cWhat happened to my right of refusal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sacrificed all rights the moment you decided to betray me.\u201d He lifted his weight enough to turn her over onto her back. \u201cI can do whatever I please with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always could,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWas this forced upon you? Yes,\u201d he said before she could answer. \u201cThat is it. That is what they did. I can see it in your eyes. I can smell it on your skin. Why did you not tell me?\u201d</p><p>The pain in her heart swelled with bitterness. \u201cI was afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have come to me at any time, sweetheart. I would have listened.\u201d Slowly, almost as if he were afraid to touch her, he put his hand on her brow and brushed her hair back.</p><p>\u201cI would have put a stop to it. I would have protected you.\u201d By telling him, she would be directly disobeying her father\u2019s orders, putting her life in danger, and risking exposing the power of the book. \u201cI was sent to avert a disaster,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I fail, everyone will die\u2014you, your jardin, the Italians, the mortals\u2014and the rest of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou speak of Armageddon.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He gave her a narrow look. \u201cWhat could you do to prevent the end of the world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you any more than I have,\u201d Reese told him. \u201cGive me The Maiden\u2019s Book of Hours, and I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t expecting that. \u201cYou betrayed me for a bloody book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need something inside it,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce I have it, humanity will be safe again, and you can keep the rest for your master.\u201d</p><p>He sat up. \u201cI do not have that book, Reese. Neither does Robin. Guisbourne stole it and took it to Rome. Robin has gone to retrieve it. That is why the contessa sent her men to take possession of Rosethorn. If Robin does not deliver the book to her tonight, she vowed to slaughter the jardin.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t fly to Rome to stop Robin of Locksley. Nothing could stop the book from reaching the contessa now. \u201cThat\u2019s it, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho sent you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u201d Nothing did. She wished she could weep, but no tears came. \u201cI\u2019ve failed. In a few days we will all be dead.\u201d</p><p>Will sighed. \u201cI do not know what you were told, but one sodding book cannot bring about the end of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one will.\u201d There was no hope left, she realized. She had always had hope. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d She couldn\u2019t ask to speak to her father. The news would surely kill him. She looked at Will blindly. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Will took her in his arms and held her, and then she could cry\u2014great, sobbing tears that she had held back for so long, too long. She struck at him with her fists, twisting and fighting against him and the terrible emptiness, and still he held her, cradling her grief, enduring her despair. He used the edge of his tunic to wipe her face and his fingers to comb back her hair, and when she thought the sorrow would crush the last shards of her heart, he put his mouth on hers.</p><p>Reese curled her fists into his tunic, clutching him tightly. He kissed her slowly, gently, coaxing her mouth open and tasting her with mindless absorption. She felt his fangs emerge as his hunger grew, and she took her mouth from his, pressing his face to her throat. He stroked his tongue over her flesh and suckled, but he wouldn\u2019t pierce her.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She would have this much, and finally he would know. \u201cWill, take me.\u201d</p><p>He drew back. \u201cI do not need your blood, Reese.\u201d</p><p>Or perhaps it was better that he didn\u2019t know. Let him have this last illusion. She would not cheat him of what would be his final moments of happiness.</p><p>She reached for the buttons of her blouse and began unfastening them. Will made no move to help her, but watched intently, the pupils of his eyes shrinking to onyx slivers, his mouth set in a hard line. She bared her breasts and then knelt to release the waistband of her skirt, pulling it and her panties down and easing her legs out of them.</p><p>He traced a winding line of dried blood that had run down from her right ear. \u201cThe last time I touched you like this, you were afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was foolish. Now all we may have is this night.\u201d She brought his hand to her heart and pressed it there. \u201cI love you. I have always loved you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes lifted from the sight of their hands. \u201cNot always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a very good liar.\u201d She reached for his shoulder and carefully released the velvet loops holding the front of his tunic in place. His garments took more time to remove than hers had, but she stopped to kiss the skin she revealed, and to breathe in the scent of him, which grew stronger and darker with every touch.</p><p>At last they lay together side by side, a small space between them. She reached across it with her hands, her legs, and her feet. She rubbed the bottom of her toes against the arch of his foot, and stroked the outside of his thigh with the inside of hers. Her hands she could not control; they went everywhere, from the angular bones of his hip to the broad vault of his chest. She felt starved for him, hollowed out by the years of deprivation and denial, and now she wanted to feast.</p><p>Will showed no outward reaction until she slipped her hand between them and palmed his erect shaft, and then his big hand wrapped around her wrist. \u201cI will not stop this time. I do not think I could.\u201d</p><p>She put an arm around his neck and pressed herself full-length against him. \u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Will spread his hand over her bottom, holding her still as he probed between her legs. Desire had made her silky wet, and she enveloped the head of his penis with her heat, bearing down on him as he pushed in, welcoming him into the narrow recess, catching her breath as he filled it with tender force. When the root of his cock pressed against the flowering folds of her labia, she gripped him from within, squeezing until his brow touched hers and he closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel that?\u201d she murmured, her excitement almost unbearable.</p><p>\u201cI feel you,\u201d he said, surging deeper.</p><p>They had been cheated of this simple thing done to give pleasure and create children. For a terrible moment she felt as if she might begin screaming again, for she had never wished for anything but Will, and one night with him was all she would know.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d When she did, he kissed her brow and then gazed into her eyes. \u201cThe world is ours now. I will not let it end.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He held her that way, watching her face as he moved, sliding out and then gliding in, a slow and elegant dance of advance and retreat. The delicate movements became a forge, his hammer to her heat, and he shaped her with every stroke, bringing her to the edge and then turning her back and working her again. Her mortal body was no match for his strength, but he tempered it, his muscles locking and his jaw setting as he kept at her, until passion blinded her and her hands clawed at him.</p><p>\u201cWill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there you are.\u201d He whispered that and other things to her, spilling dark words against her hair, his chest stroking the swollen ache in her breasts. He turned her onto her back and wedged himself between her thighs, burying himself in her before drawing out again and again. She wrapped her legs around his, pinning herself to him, and took everything he gave her, returning it with softness and pleading, wordless sounds, until he pushed her over the edge and she fell, trembling and breathless, into the velvet darkness that spread inside her from the clenching ellipse of her sex to the pounding rhythm of her heart.</p> <p>Will held her against his chest, soothing her with gentle kisses until she came back to her senses, and then began the dance again.</p><p>The sweat from her skin made them both slick by the time he lifted her and put her astride him. Her fingers slipped down his shoulders and dug into the muscles of his arms as she worked her body against his. He took her by the waist and spun her, pushing her to her hands and knees as he knelt behind her, forging so deep inside her she felt him pressing against her womb. He reached around her hip and pressed his hand between her thighs, parting her with the edge of his palm and using that to stroke her there, where the friction made her swell and cry out as she went over again. He kept rubbing at her sex as he fucked her, his shaft a swollen, rigid spike of need, and when she pressed her face into the blankets to muffle her cries he took hold of her hips, pounding himself into her in long, deep strokes, until the last he held himself inside her and groaned as his body spilled into her.</p><p>When she could think again, Reese found herself on her side, curled up tightly against him, his arm clamped around her waist. His hand moved over her belly in absentminded circles, his thumb brushing over the dent of her navel, his mouth at her shoulder, kissing the curve between it and her neck. She put a hand to her own cheek and felt the warmth and dampness there, divided by a single cool tear that slid aimlessly across her face.</p><p>Will murmured something, and only when he repeated it did she hear the words. \u201cMy God, what was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove, Will.\u201d She entwined her fingers with his. \u201cIt was love.\u201d</p> <p>Rebecca stayed in the camper, drinking some of the blood wine Will Scarlet had sent for her. The rest she had taken in the camper had helped her regain some of her senses, but it had also given her talent time to grow. Without Sylas to help her keep it in check, she didn\u2019t know how much longer she could hold on to her sanity.</p><p>I can wait. I can reach him through our bond. He can help me.</p><p>Concentrating, she tried over and over to reach Sylas. Gradually she became aware of his body, still and unfeeling, strapped to some hard surface. The only sight she saw was the ceiling above him, and the faces of the men shouting questions at him. They wanted to know where the prisoners had gone. They struck him, but he did not respond. He could not; his soul had left his flesh.</p><p>She understood that he felt no pain now, but when he returned to his body he would be in agony. Every blow she felt through him did not harm her, but still she flinched, gripping her skirts until she tore great rents in the fabric.</p><p>Do not tear your pretty dress, wife, Sylas whispered inside her mind. I am here.</p><p>His presence, as thin and insubstantial as smoke, almost slipped away before she could answer. Sylas, you must go back to your body. Tell them what they wish to know, or they will kill you.</p> <p>I cannot betray my men. A cold, mindless rage lashed around him. The shadows are so deep here. I never realized how deep.</p><p>She was losing him to the darkness. Sylas, come back to me.</p><p>When I hear your voice call my name, he promised her, I will come back. Only then.</p><p>Rebecca opened her eyes but didn\u2019t recognize her surroundings. She was somewhere near Sylas but not close enough to call him. Her skin crawled, alive with nerves that writhed and tightened and burned with need. She knew what she needed, and she would have it.</p><p>She found a small door and kicked it open. Outside was the night, a small camp of tents, and the woods beyond Rosethorn. She could walk to the stronghold from here, she thought as she climbed down and started toward the house.</p><p>Some faceless male came toward her. \u201cMy lady Rebecca, you must not...\u201d His voice stopped as he choked out blood and fell to his knees. As she limped past, he fell onto his side, pressing his hands to his face as the blood poured from between his fingers.</p><p>Rebecca limped into the trees, tugging at her skirts when they became snagged. Two more males, both holding swords, came at her from different sides. She released her talent and they dropped into the shrubs. All around her small bodies began dropping from the trees and thumping to the ground. She stepped over a robin and a squirrel, and around the twitching death throes of a red fox. As she made her way past the first of the enemy\u2019s lines, she left a trail of dead bodies and the scent of clover on fire.</p><p>Reese woke with Will to the sound of men shouting and cries for help. She handed him his trousers before she jerked on her clothes, but when she tried to follow him he shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cStay here until I see what has happened.\u201d He glanced down at the small pile of ropes he had torn from her wrists.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t try to escape,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cThere will be a guard outside if you do,\u201d he said, and then ducked out of the tent.</p><p>He had no reason to trust her, but still, it hurt. She had given herself to him. She had told him about the book\u2014violating her pledge to her father in the process\u2014and put herself into his hands. As before, he had abandoned her without a second thought.</p><p>She took her case out of her bag and removed one of the vials. As Will came back into the tent, she drank it and slipped the empty vial in her pocket. \u201cIs it Rebecca?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d When she did, he pushed her against the tent pole and pulled her arms around behind her to tie her wrists.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tie me up,\u201d she said. \u201cI have nowhere to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like to keep it that way, sweetheart.\u201d He came around and stopped, staring at her face. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your sweetheart.\u201d Reese turned her arms, snapping the cords binding her wrists.</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d Will didn\u2019t blink. \u201cYou\u2019re a man, for one thing.\u201d He breathed in. \u201cAnd you\u2019re Kyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the moment,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cThe woman in my dreams could change her shape. But how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know exactly how. You changed me with that kiss.\u201d She stepped away from the pole and handed him the torn ropes. \u201cI went back to the kitchens feeling the weight of it on me. Then, that night, I fell sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI died in the cottage, but no one came to look for me for three days. I woke from death in a cart filled with dead bodies.\u201d She pulled her long black hair over one shoulder and began to braid it. \u201cDo you know what it\u2019s like to wake up in a pile of corpses, alone and starving? No, of course you don\u2019t.\u201d She turned her back on him. \u201cYou made the change in the jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lived.\u201d He jerked her around. \u201cAll this time you were alive, and you came to me only once, in a dream? You never looked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what I told you in that dream? What they do with a dead girl who crawls out of a mass grave?\u201d She tilted her head. \u201cNo? I can tell you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His hands fell away from her. \u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>She walked around him and went to look out at the camp. \u201cThrough all of it, in that cage, the one thing I could not understand was what I had done to deserve such a wretched fate. I\u2019d always been a good girl, worked hard, looked after my mother. I prayed for forgiveness for my sins, though they were hardly worth confessing. I\u2019d never harmed anyone. It had to be a mistake. I told them that again and again. Whenever I did, they would just hurt me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long did they torture you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Months. A year, perhaps.\u201d She let the tent flap slip from her fingers. \u201cTime had no meaning for me. I tried to count the sunsets, but then they put boards over the windows so no one would discover me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything else you said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I went mad? That I killed them? All true.\u201d Reese rubbed a hand against her cheek, the roughness and strange flatness of it slightly disturbing. She avoided changing into a male when she could; the physical differences between the genders made it feel uncomfortable and alien. \u201cI escaped and I went into the woods. I lived like the animal they made me. No mortal was safe from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething made you stop.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cFather came for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClary, your father died before you could walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod was merciful and gave me another one.\u201d She finished her braid and used a tie from her bag to bind the end. \u201cHe brought me out of hell and cared for me until the madness passed. He taught me that my life, cursed as it is, could have some meaning. I could use what had befallen me to help the world and protect the innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy betraying your own kind?\u201d Will scowled at her. \u201cI don\u2019t know who this man was, but he did you no kindness. He deceived you. He used you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou know nothing about Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot talk to you like this.\u201d He gestured at her. \u201cTake back your real shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, not without blood.\u201d She showed him her case of vials, then removed one filled with Reese\u2019s blood and drank from it. Immediately her body shifted from that of a Kyn male to the mortal tresora.</p><p>Lucan stepped into the tent. \u201cScarlet, do you mean to keep everyone waiting until dawn?\u201d He glanced at Reese. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be tied to something?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSomeone has to stop Rebecca,\u201d Reese said, ignoring Lucan. \u201cUnlike everyone else, she trusts me.

Rebecca and Sylas belong together.\u201d She looked down at the unconscious suzerain. \u201cWhat is his talent?\u201d</p> <p>He got to his feet. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it will be mine as well, for as long as I keep his form. I take on their strengths, their weaknesses, their scent, everything.\u201d She glared at him. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind out for yourself,\u201d he snarled back.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, tell me.\u201d She flinched as the bottle of bloodwine on the table exploded. \u201cHe shatters glass, is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlass. Bone. Flesh. Lives.\u201d He advanced on her. \u201cHe was Richard\u2019s chief assassin. He can kill anything he touches. It\u2019s why he wears the gloves.\u201d</p><p>She backed away, her silver eyes wide. \u201cStay away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot permit you to commit suicide,\u201d Will told her. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to use his talent to get past me.\u201d</p><p>A large, tattooed Scotsman ducked inside the tent. \u201cScarlet, where the devil...?\u201d He looked from Will to the unconscious Lucan to the one standing. \u201cSo Satan does exist, and takes great joy in our misery.\u201d</p> <p>Reese took out her dagger and ran to the back wall of the tent, slicing it open and stepping through the slit. The camp had been thrown into chaos; no one noticed the suzerain who darted across to the woods. Reese almost choked on the thick scent Rebecca had left behind, and as she followed it she saw the dead animals the chatelaine\u2019s power had killed.</p><p>She knew Rebecca was a gentle woman, but the strain of separation had proven too much. For her to be able to do this with her talent meant nothing living was safe now.</p><p>Rebecca had almost reached the front gates when Reese made it to the clearing. Men came out of the stronghold and rushed toward her, but began to drop before they could get within a few feet of her.</p><p>The siege of Rosethorn had begun, and it would be fought by one woman\u2014one who had gone mad.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>The tide had turned against him, and as Saetta barricaded himself in the main hall, he thought it fitting that the siege should end where it had begun. Here, where they had been made welcome; here, where they had won their first victory. His only regret was that he had not held the place two full days. He had promised his lady that he would.</p><p>Beyond the hall, he could hear the cries of his men, and the thuds of their bodies as they fell. He would not have believed that the pretty, gentle-looking creature Sylas called wife could be capable of slaying so many without even touching them, but he had watched her do it himself, from the ravelin.</p><p>He went to the table where they had tied Sylas\u2019s body. The castellan had lost a great deal of blood during the beatings his men had administered, but never uttered a sound or made any indication that he felt the pain. He stared up at the ceiling blindly, lost in himself or the dreamlands.</p><p>\u201cMar\u00e9chal,\u201d Bernardo whispered, and pointed to a long, deep shadow that seemed to be separating itself from the wall and taking on the vague shape of a man. \u201cThe demon comes.\u201d</p><p>Saetta stepped between the shadow warrior and his men. \u201cYou have taken enough lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWar master,\u201d the shadow man said, his voice a mere whisper. \u201cYou are defeated now. She is coming. Surrender before more men die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have pledged to hold this place for our lady,\u201d Saetta told the creature. \u201cWe will die before we surrender.\u201d</p><p>The dark form swelled as more shadows drifted from the corners and melded with it. \u201cYou have been made a fool.\u201d</p><p>Saetta stiffened. \u201cWe serve our lady with honor and loyalty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have left your lady before the chapel fire,\u201d the dark figure murmured. \u201cYou know siegecraft, mar\u00e9chal. If your garrison means to abandon you, how do you stop them? Do you command them to stay, or do you destroy their reasons for leaving?\u201d</p><p>Saetta frowned. \u201cOur lady would never do such an evil thing. She is good and kind. She saved us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe saved you just after your lord and half your jardin were slaughtered.\u201d The shadow undulated. \u201cYou went to her and told her you meant to leave, and she saved you. She needed you to protect her from the Brethren, and she saved you. But not your families. Not your women, not your children. She saved you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lie.\u201d Bernardo rushed forward, only to be swallowed whole, so quickly that his clothes and blades slid across the floor.</p><p>\u201cWho were the first to be sent out of the stronghold during a siege?\u201d the shadow warrior whispered as it grew larger.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Saetta took a step back. \u201cYou are wrong. She would never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how it was done. The old, the sick, the children. Expelled from the stronghold because they serve no purpose. They did not protect the lord. They used up the stores. So they were sent out to become trapped between the stronghold and the besiegers\u2019 lines. There they were kept, and there they starved until they died.\u201d</p><p>The mar\u00e9chal\u2019s expression grew stricken. \u201cBe silent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could not send them away. She could not easily starve them,\u201d the shadow warrior said. \u201cHow would you dispatch so many?\u201d</p><p>Saetta drew his sword, stabbing it into the dark form. Frost coated the blade as the shadow warrior laughed and then dispersed, the darkness skittering away to the different corners of the hall.</p><p>One of his men picked up Bernardo\u2019s sword. \u201cHow do we fight such a creature?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not know.\u201d Saetta looked over at the motionless form of Sylas of Daven. \u201cBut there is only one man here who knew about the fire.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca limped up to the barricaded entrance to the main house and stopped, vaguely surprised when it wouldn\u2019t open. Until now the strange men had opened all the doors, hurrying out to welcome her home and then falling asleep. She could feel Sylas within, moving and unmoving, but the door wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><p>Sylas wouldn\u2019t lock her out. Someone was playing a trick. Someone was trying to keep her from him.</p><p>Something struck her shoulder and burned in her flesh. She reached back, pulled out the copper bolt, and saw a group of strangers standing at a distance and pointing crossbows and guns at her. They were firing them, the bolts hissing through the air all around her. A small dart pierced her hip, and she pulled it out, holding it up to watch the blue liquid inside it drip out.</p><p>Some of the madness cleared from her mind as she remembered. They had used these the first time. In the hall. The last time she had seen Sylas. The thought of her husband, however sent her thoughts back into a confused snarl.</p><p>Bewildered, Rebecca sent her talent at them with a flick of her hand, and they stopped shooting bolts at her. They wept their tears of blood for her and then lay down to sleep.</p><p>The door remained locked against her.</p><p>Rebecca placed her hand on the wood. It was old and dead, but inside its hardened planks she felt life; millions of tiny creatures who wept for her. The wood swelled and then began to splinter, oozing with their tears. She pried away one of the weakened planks, exposing the locking mechanism and tearing that out of the door. When it still would not open, she punched her fist through, reaching in to feel for the bar across the inside, and lifted it out of the way.</p><p>The door fell away, and the strangers inside shouted to one another before they ran. Rebecca stepped over the threshold and stopped to take one of the old war shields from the wall. Her shoulder hurt, and she was tired, but she wouldn\u2019t let them shoot her again. They didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>She was home.</p><p>Reese knew it would be too dangerous to approach Rebecca in Lucan\u2019s form, so as soon as she reached the stronghold she used another vial. She was almost glad to shift into the body of Reese Carmichael. The big blond Kyn lord had been powerful, but his talent reminded her too much of Rebecca\u2019s.</p><p>She followed the bodies that had fallen into the house, but apparently the Italians had realized they couldn\u2019t fight the chatelaine and fled, for no more appeared. The house had gone silent, and corridors seemed much darker than they had last night.</p><p>Reese stopped to decide which direction to go, and as she turned a cold sensation ran up the side of her arm. As soon as she stepped away from the shadowed wall and into the light, it went away, but now her arm felt numb.</p><p>He is in the shadows, Rebecca had said.</p><p>Reese hurried down the right passage, taking care to stay in the center, under the lights. She heard a man cursing in Italian and then an abrupt silence, and headed in that direction. As she did, she took a pressure dart out of her bag and held it ready in her hand.</p><p>She went around a corner to see Rebecca standing at the stairwell leading down to the basement. She was tracking Sylas by his scent, Reese guessed, and took a deep breath before she took a step toward her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRebecca.\u201d</p><p>The chatelaine looked back at her and smiled. \u201cReese. You have returned.\u201d She glanced at the stairs. \u201cDid you see Sylas go down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did,\u201d she lied. \u201cJust a minute ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe is playing hide-and-seek with the strangers.\u201d She put a hand to her own shoulder. \u201cI think I will scold him for that. I never liked that game.\u201d She started down the stairs.</p><p>Reese felt beads of sweat break out on her brow and upper lip as she followed, but when she wiped them away they made a red streak on her fingers. Rebecca wouldn\u2019t hurt her, but she had lost control of her talent. Reese knew she would have only one chance to get to her.</p><p>The chatelaine limped through the basements until she stopped in front of an empty holding cell. \u201cSylas was here last.\u201d She frowned as she peered inside. \u201cWhy is he not here now?\u201d</p><p>Reese ran, throwing herself at Rebecca and knocking them both to the floor. As blood stung her eyes and poured from her nose, she jammed the pressure cartridge into Rebecca\u2019s neck and emptied it.</p><p>Some of the madness cleared from Rebecca\u2019s eyes. \u201cReese. You must kill me. Please. Before I hurt anyone else.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d she said as she used a blade to cut into Rebecca\u2019s wrist. Before the wound closed, she brought it to her mouth. As soon as Rebecca\u2019s blood touched her lips, her body began to shift. The blood cleared from her eyes, and long golden brown hair fell in a curtain around her face.</p><p>Rebecca\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your friend,\u201d Reese said in Rebecca\u2019s voice. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to put an end to this.\u201d She groped for her bag, removed another cartridge, and infused Rebecca with a second dose of the drug. \u201cSleep now.\u201d</p><p>Heavy eyelids closed over confused eyes, and the chatelaine went limp.</p><p>Reese lifted Rebecca over her shoulder and carried her into the cell, placing her gently on the straw-stuffed mattress before she locked her inside. Then she turned and went back to the stairwell.</p><p>Along with Rebecca\u2019s appearance, Reese discovered too late that she had also taken on her paralyzed leg, which hampered her pace. She had nearly made it to the top of the stairs when one of the cavalieri appeared above her. She felt Rebecca\u2019s talent writhing inside her, demanding to be released, but clamped down on the power.</p> <p>\u201cYou witch.\u201d The Italian drew his dagger, but his hand shook and the blade jittered in his grasp. \u201cYou brought this curse upon us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you do not wish me to bleed you, traitor,\u201d she told the Italian as she slowly mounted the last of the steps, \u201cthen you had better run. Now.\u201d</p><p>Terrified, he dropped the dagger and fled.</p><p>Reese encountered two more of the Italians on her way to the main hall. Both brandished bloody swords, but froze at the sight of her. It took only a smile to send them in the opposite direction.</p><p>She had expected to find the hall barricaded, but one of the doors stood open. As she limped into the great room, she saw Saetta and the last remnants of his guards surrounding a table, upon which lay the unmoving body of Sylas of Daven. The other men backed away as soon as she came into sight, but the mar\u00e9chal only drew his sword and held it poised above Sylas\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cStay where you are,\u201d he told her, \u201cor I will take his head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here for you.\u201d She turned until she found the deepest well of shadows in the room, and hobbled over to it. \u201cSylas.\u201d</p><p>The darkness swelled, taking on the indistinct shape of the shadow warrior.</p> <p>\u201cRebecca.\u201d The featureless head turned. \u201cYou are in danger. Leave this place.\u201d</p><p>Abruptly all the shadows in the room began to grow.</p><p>\u201cNo, my love. I am here with you. I am safe.\u201d She hated deceiving him, but if she didn\u2019t convince him to return to his body this siege might never end. \u201cThe battle is over. You can come home now.\u201d</p><p>A thin, black tendril drifted out and wrapped around her body, moving as lightly and softly as smoke. \u201cI love you, wife.\u201d</p><p>Tears spilled from Rebecca\u2019s eyes as she told her final lie. \u201cAnd I you, husband.\u201d</p><p>The air became electric, and the shadow slowly separated itself from the wall. Although it remained mostly a shapeless cloud, Reese could see the faint shape of a man\u2019s legs moving and his arms swinging.</p><p>\u201cRemove your blade,\u201d she told Saetta as the dark mass approached him. \u201cLet him come back to us now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are insane.\u201d The mar\u00e9chal glared at her. \u201cThat thing will eat him, like the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMar\u00e9chal, that thing is him.\u201d</p><p>The drifting shadow rose from the floor and hovered over Sylas\u2019s motionless form. It shrank into itself, becoming a dark twin of the unconscious male, before it drifted down and enveloped his body.</p><p>\u201cGod in heaven,\u201d she heard Saetta murmur as the darkness began to sink into Sylas\u2019s body. \u201cIt is true. He is a demon incarnate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is the master of shadows.\u201d</p><p>The darkness vanished, and all around the room the shadows thinned until they were once more the places where the light did not reach. Reese went over to Sylas and looked down at his still face. If he didn\u2019t wake now, Rebecca would be lost forever.</p><p>\u201cSylas.\u201d She put her hand over his. \u201cOpen your eyes. Tell me I wasn\u2019t too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will tell you anything you wish, my lady,\u201d he said, turning his head and looking at her, \u201cif you will tell me where my wife is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your wife, man,\u201d Saetta said.</p><p>\u201cShe has my wife\u2019s form, and her voice, and her scent.\u201d Sylas sat up, holding on to Reese\u2019s hand when she would have moved away. \u201cBut not her touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe came for you,\u201d Reese said. \u201cShe was lost in the madness. I had to stop her.\u201d</p><p>Sylas\u2019s grip turned brutal. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca lives,\u201d she said quickly, wincing as he eased his hold. \u201cI drugged her and locked her in a cell downstairs.\u201d</p><p>Sylas pushed himself off the table. \u201cTake me to her.\u201d He stopped suddenly, and Reese glanced back to see Saetta holding the tip of his sword against Sylas\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cYou can kill his body,\u201d Reese said, \u201cbut he won\u2019t die. He\u2019ll only go back into the shadows. Then, when Rebecca wakes up, you can explain it to her. If there\u2019s anything left of you.\u201d</p><p>Her lie made Sylas give her a sideways look. \u201cYou should listen to the lady, mar\u00e9chal.\u201d</p><p>Slowly Saetta withdrew his sword. \u201cShe stays here with me.\u201d</p><p>Reese handed Sylas the keys to the cells. \u201cHurry. I don\u2019t know how much longer the drugs will keep her unconscious.\u201d</p><p>Once the castellan had left them, Reese turned to face Saetta. \u201cThe besiegers will be coming through that door any moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am no prize, mar\u00e9chal.\u201d Reese wearily took the last vial from her pocket, drank it, and resumed the appearance of Will\u2019s mortal lover. She had to brace herself against the edge of the table to keep from collapsing. \u201cI suggest you put down your weapons and recall whatever men you have left.\u201d</p><p>He looked up as they heard the sound of men running toward the hall. \u201cPerhaps you are right.\u201d</p><p>Reese moved over to the fire and sat on the edge of the hearth. The stone had been warmed by the flames, but she felt so cold she could barely feel it. She had saved Rebecca, but for what? In a few days they would all be dead.</p><p>Someone lifted her up, and she opened her eyes to see Will\u2019s face. \u201cYou can leave me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sweetheart,\u201d he said as he carried her out of the room. \u201cI\u2019m never doing that again.\u201d</p><p>They must have worked him over for hours, Sylas thought, putting a hand to his ribs as he felt them slowly knitting. He could barely walk, and had to take the stairs one step at a time, but he could smell her now, her sweet scent all around him.</p><p>When he reached the holding cell, Sylas saw her inside. She looked so pale, so helpless. He had long known about her talent, but she had never set it loose upon the world. This angelic creature, his wife, commanded the power of an army.</p><p>He opened the door and stepped inside, feeling the relief of being with her again with every step. Carefully he lowered himself beside her, putting his arm over her and resting his cheek against hers.</p><p>\u201cSylas.\u201d Her eyes fluttered. \u201c\u2019Tis you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, my lady.\u201d He kissed her. \u201cI am here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was looking for you, I think, and then...\u201d She frowned as she tried to focus, and her expression changed. \u201cWhy are we in the dungeon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a long story.\u201d He climbed onto the mattress with her, and held her against his chest.</p><p>She cuddled against him and sighed with sleepy contentment. \u201cIs the siege over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady. You are home.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>It took the rest of the night to carry out the dead, and part of the next day to bury them. The survivors of the siege were removed to the dungeons, and held in the same cell where they had imprisoned the garrison. The men of Rosethorn buried their friends along with their enemies, and while there was talk of justice, no one spoke of revenge.</p><p>Will Scarlet held council with his men before he assembled them outside the main hall and sent guards to bring the survivors before him for judgment.</p><p>Rebecca\u2019s attack had wiped out two-thirds of the contessa\u2019s forces, but Saetta still led the small group of cavalieri. He came forward slowly, his movements hampered by the copper chains and manacles binding his hands and feet. Someone had torn open his shirt, revealing the old burn scars on his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou attacked this stronghold without provocation,\u201d Will said. \u201cWe offered you sanctuary, and you used that against us. You violated our trust and betrayed your duty, and among our kind, there is no greater offense. The last time it happened, an entire jardin was put to the blade.\u201d He paused and looked into the war master\u2019s eyes. \u201cI know. I was there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou may do as you wish with me,\u201d Saetta told Will. \u201cMake me your slave, imprison me, starve me slowly. I will not resist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would not matter if you did.\u201d Will studied the other man\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou want something in return, I imagine.\u201d</p><p>With difficulty Saetta dropped down on his knees and bowed his head. \u201cIn this, my men but followed my orders. They fought for their lady with dignity and honor. I beg you wield your dagger swiftly, and grant them the coup de gr\u00e2ce.\u201d</p> <p>The coup de gr\u00e2ce, the swift and merciful end by a thin-bladed dagger through a chink in the armor, administered by a brother in arms.</p><p>Will stood watching the impassive faces of the cavalieri. They stared straight ahead, their features tight with leashed emotion. For a moment he felt as if centuries vanished, and he once again faced his blood Kyn across the field of battle. They had looked exactly the same as they advanced on Richard\u2019s troops, led by Guisbourne in his black and silver battle armor. Walking into hell with their eyes open and their hearts torn to pieces.</p><p>He looked down at Saetta. \u201cFirst, you will tell me who you were.\u201d</p><p>Saetta lifted his head. \u201cGuiliano da Sangallo.\u201d</p><p>Not a war master, but a master builder. \u201cIf you are da Sangallo, then you built fortresses for princes. Kings. A Kyn building for mortals.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy family has been masters of siegecraft since the First Crusade,\u201d Saetta said. \u201cIt was my trade. My mortal patrons never knew what I was.\u201d</p><p>Will almost believed him. \u201cHow do a sculptor and an architect of castles come to serve as mar\u00e9chal to Contessa Borgiana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife was her cousin. When the Brethren took control of the Vatican after Alexander died, we knew it was only a matter of time before they discovered us. I took my family out of Rome and offered my service to Lord Arno in exchange for protection for my wife and daughter.\u201d His voice changed. \u201cIt made no difference in the end. The Brethren still found us and murdered them. If not for the contessa, I would have joined them.\u201d</p><p>In the terrible gray days after the change, when Will had learned of Claris\u2019s death from the plague, he had considered leaving Robin and Sherwood, and ending his miserable life. Then Robin had chosen him as his seneschal, and for some time the constant duty and work of protecting his master had been all that kept him from joining his love in sweet oblivion.</p><p>Saetta had no longer had any purpose or interest in life.</p><p>\u201cStand up,\u201d Will said. When the Italian got to his feet, Will gestured to the English courier Richard had sent. \u201cTell them everything you told me.\u201d</p> <p>It took some time for the courier to recount the events that had taken place, beginning with the assassination of Arno during the jardin wars. As Saetta listened, his mask of indifference slowly began to fall away. By the time the courier had finished his tale, the master builder\u2019s eyes were filled with rage.</p><p>\u201cThere is proof of what you say?\u201d Will asked the courier.</p><p>\u201cSuzerain Geoffrey has footage from his security cameras,\u201d the courier said. \u201cThe high lord\u2019s seigneurs were present and can verify everything I have told you. Some of the contessa\u2019s men survived. I cannot say how much longer they will live, but they, too, can give testimony of her deeds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you satisfied?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>\u201cHer treachery made fools of us all.\u201d Saetta glanced back at his men for a moment before facing Will. \u201cWe cannot even beg for mercy, not for what she has done. Do as you will with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold.\u201d Sylas stepped out of the shadows, Rebecca at his side. \u201cI would speak for the captives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would?\u201d Will turned to him. \u201cYou suffered more at their hands than anyone, castellan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father once told me that revenge is a hell we build for our enemies, but willingly cast ourselves in.\u201d He kissed his wife\u2019s temple before reluctantly moving away from her. \u201cGuiliano da Sangallo kept his oath to his lord, and served his lady in good faith. I ask mercy for him and his men, seneschal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey killed your second,\u201d Will reminded him.</p><p>Sylas nodded. \u201cAnd they lost fifty of their friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re not going to kill anyone else,\u201d Lucan drawled, \u201cI\u2019m taking my men and going home to my woman.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca came forward. \u201cI would speak to this man.\u201d Without waiting for permission, she went to Saetta. \u201cYou could have killed my husband at any time. He was helpless whenever he left his body. You knew in the end that he was in the shadows. Why did you spare his life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you smile at him the first night we came.\u201d His eyes met hers. \u201cMy wife had the same smile for me.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him for a long time before she spoke again. \u201cYou will be with her again someday.\u201d She turned to Will. \u201cI, too, ask mercy for these men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is territory to the north that belongs to Lord Locksley,\u201d Will said. \u201cIt is rough and overgrown, but the land is good. I have always wished to build a retreat there for the suzerain, but there has never been enough time to see to it. Twenty men working together with a master builder could make much of it, I think.\u201d</p><p>Saetta stared at him. \u201cWhy would you do this for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, you would do this for your new lord,\u201d Will said. \u201cAfter you pledge him your lives and loyalty, of course. I have good reason to believe you would die before you would betray him.\u201d</p><p>Saetta\u2019s dull eyes came alive. \u201cA retreat, you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne that demands no quarter,\u201d Will said, \u201cand no more blood be spilled.\u201d He held out his hand. \u201cDo you agree, master builder?\u201d</p><p>Saetta clasped Will\u2019s forearm. \u201cWith all my heart, seneschal.\u201d</p><p>Lucan immediately moved his men into the stronghold, but remained at the camp with Jayr and mac Byrne to help guard the perimeter, this time against any mortal intrusion. Will arranged for more stores to be delivered, and went down that night to assure that the suzeraina and her men had everything they needed.</p><p>When he arrived in camp, Will saw Jayr come out of her tent, only to heave something into the forest. The object struck a tree trunk and exploded as she became a blurry streak of motion. By the time Will blinked, she had vanished.</p><p>\u201cCyprien does not need an army,\u201d Lucan said as he came to stand beside Will. \u201cHe can simply ask Alexandra to phone his enemies.\u201d</p><p>Will knew of only one thing that could have made the suzeraina so angry. \u201cI will go to her.\u201d</p><p>The former assassin crouched and prodded the fire with a gnarled branch. \u201cSomehow I doubt she will wish to be comforted by her father\u2019s best friend.\u201d</p><p>Will looked down at him. \u201cYou knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guessed.\u201d The suzerain straightened. \u201cGood God, man, she is the very image of Robin, especially when she uses a bow.\u201d He studied Will\u2019s expression. \u201cYou have long been her friend. Why did you never tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil the winter tournament, when she was made lady paramount, I never knew.\u201d Will ducked his head. \u201cWhen we took her and mac Byrne from a pit trap, I saw the mark of her birth for the first time. \u2019Twas exactly the same as the mark Robin once had. One he cut from his chest after Marian died.\u201d He glanced in the direction Jayr had run. \u201cThen I did not know what to think.\u201d He saw mac Byrne and the patrol approaching. \u201cOr say.\u201d</p><p>Lucan followed his gaze. \u201cI will deal with her lord. You go and see to the lady.\u201d</p><p>Will tracked Jayr for half a mile before he found her standing on a hill overlooking the estate. He kept back and watched her for a time, but she didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Suddenly she turned and looked at him. \u201cDo you come to apologize or explain?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for his answer as she strode down to him. \u201cHow will you make amends for him? Do you mean to tell me more of his lies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came as your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friend.\u201d She laughed. \u201cWill Scarlet, second to Robin of Locksley, the eyes at his back, his third blade. Friend to his bastard daughter. It does not have the same ring of honor to it, does it?\u201d</p><p>He saw that her eyes had turned the same shade of violet as Robin\u2019s, and felt the violence radiating from her like the heat of fever. \u201cHe never took me into his confidence about the matter, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us.\u201d She halted and glanced up at the sky. \u201cThere is a plane waiting for me in Atlanta. I must depart as soon as I can reach it. Then to England, to have Cyprien\u2019s leech punch holes in my bones. All for the thieving liar who fathered me in rape and then made himself my friend. So that I might save his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobin would never have forced Marian.\u201d Will caught her fist before it connected with his jaw. \u201cJayr, he loved her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo proud was he of this love,\u201d she said with a sneer, \u201cthat he could not wait to claim me as his child. Oh, but I forget\u2014he handed that honor to Guisbourne at the winter tourney.\u201d</p><p>Will felt miserable, both for her and for his master. \u201cI cannot say why Rob chose to do as he has. I only know that Marian was his sun and moon, and you the stars. Why do you think he came so often to the Realm?\u201d</p><p>The rage abruptly left her, and she shook her head. \u201cI cannot understand this. Robin and I have known each other since Bannockburn. He might have told me a thousand times.</p><p>\u201cI hold his fate in my hands,\u201d Jayr said. \u201cIf I do not go to England this night, Alexandra says he will die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dead man can tell you nothing,\u201d Will said carefully. \u201cSave him and he will be in your debt. Make your price the answers you seek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that when he tells me I can kill him?\u201d She gave him a jaded look. \u201cI may as well spare myself the journey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever Robin has done,\u201d he reminded her, \u201cwhen you lay dying at Bannockburn, he saved you. You owe him for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that how you see it? A life for a life?\u201d She threw out her arms. \u201cWhat of my mother? He raped her. My birth killed her. What does he owe for her life? What do I?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll I can tell you is this: When we returned from the Crusades, he left me in Sherwood and went to Scotland,\u201d Will told her. \u201cWhen he finally came back, he looked like a ghost of himself. He wouldn\u2019t speak or rest or eat. If anyone came near him, he would draw his sword. Then he went into the forest and challenged every outlaw, murderer, and thief who crossed his path. \u2019Twas how he became their prince.\u201d</p><p>Jayr made an impatient gesture. \u201cWhat of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were women in Sherwood Forest, too. Young, old, plain, and beautiful, and none of them could stay away from him. They followed him about like lovesick girls,\u201d Will said softly. \u201cHe could have taken any of them, but he wouldn\u2019t touch them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo he spared a few peasants his dubious charms\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRob didn\u2019t touch any woman for a hundred years.\u201d He saw the shock appear in her eyes. \u201cDoes that sound to you like a man who cares nothing for the right of a woman to refuse him?\u201d</p><p>She moved away from him, her back rigid, and stood staring down at the lake for a long, silent interval. Finally she turned. \u201cI will go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will come with you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are needed here.\u201d She glanced back toward the camp. \u201cShe is awake now, but she will not leave your tent. She awaits you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes she.\u201d Will had been avoiding Claris since bringing her to the camp. \u201cI must deal with the Italians first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn truth, she is the one who saved Rosethorn,\u201d Jayr said. \u201cRemember that, seneschal.\u201d</p><p>Claris watched Will follow the suzerain out of camp, and stepped back into the tent. She knew his duties demanded much of him, but each time he came to the camp, he never even bothered to look in on her.</p><p>He must hate her now.</p><p>Suddenly she couldn\u2019t bear to spend another moment among the Kyn, and grabbed her bag. She found that she still had the keys to the camper, and hurried off to it. But where would she go from here? No one wanted her. No one cared.</p><p>I will release you from your vow.</p> <p>Father still did not know the truth. She had not found the book, but it had not been here. Guisbourne had stolen it from Locksley, and now Locksley would deliver it into the hands of the contessa. They had assumed the wrong things, had acted on the wrong information. It was her duty to tell her father that she had failed.</p><p>Claris drove out of camp, unaware of the vehicle following her. She drove too fast, but she couldn\u2019t wait to reach the house where her father waited. She felt as frantic as Rebecca, as determined as Sylas. She ran up the drive and into the house, but came to a halt as she saw that all the furnishings had been draped with white dust cloths.</p><p>\u201cFather?\u201d</p><p>She hurried to his library, but the chair by the fireplace sat empty. No fire burned; only a thin layer of ash covered the brick. The desk had been cleared of his papers, the books removed from his shelves. The only trace of life she saw was a bottle half-filled with wine that sat on one of the tables. He must have drunk some of it before he had gone.</p><p>He had abandoned her.</p><p>\u201cClaris.\u201d</p><p>She turned to see Will and Lucan behind her. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had nothing better to do than hare around Atlanta after you.\u201d Lucan strolled over to her father\u2019s chair and sat down. \u201cI suppose a glass of wine would be utterly out of the question.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs this where you were living?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>\u201cWe leased the house when we came to America.\u201d Numbly she went over to the desk and opened one of the drawers. His pens were gone. \u201cMy father must have gone back to England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother tried that once\u2014moving away in the dead of night and not telling me where.\u201d Lucan studied his fingernails. \u201cDamned decent of her, I always thought.\u201d</p><p>A man in a black robe stepped into the room. \u201cI waited for you, child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your father?\u201d Will saw the embroidered red Templar cross on the man\u2019s robe and drew his dagger. \u201cA Brethren priest? You did all this for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is true. I sent Claris to infiltrate your ranks in order to steal The Maiden\u2019s Book of Hours,\u201d he continued as if Will hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cEverything she has done has been on my orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReese?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI have returned the young lady to her apartment,\u201d he said. \u201cShe suffered no ill effects from being our guest, and her new fianc\u00e9 has also been dealt with.\u201d</p><p>Will stared at him. \u201cI know you.\u201d His expression darkened. \u201cYou were the priest sent to Aubury. Ennis of Worcester. The inquisitor.\u201d He whipped around toward Claris. \u201cYou pledged yourself to this butcher?\u201d</p><p>She looked past him. \u201cFather, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has served me faithfully these seven hundred years,\u201d Ennis said. \u201cAlmost from the moment I rose from my grave to walk the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Brethren turned Kyn.\u201d Lucan rested his head against his hand. \u201cDear God. Now I have seen everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was sent to Aubury to capture and interrogate the dark Kyn.\u201d Ennis didn\u2019t cower or run, but stood calmly as Will approached him. \u201cI was very good at my task, as I am sure you know. A hundred of your kind died in my dungeons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may have my life, Will,\u201d Claris pleaded. \u201cOnly spare him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He turned on her. \u201cWhy? Why would you die for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not know our history,\u201d Ennis said. \u201cAs a mortal I became arrogant. I was no longer satisfied with the Kyn who were captured and brought to me. I began to hunt them on my own. By that time Claris had been seen all over the countryside. I believed the descriptions of her mad behavior would make her easy prey. But I miscalculated. Madness does not equal weakness. I tracked her, and found her. When I cornered her, she did what every wounded thing does.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s head spun. \u201cShe changed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Claris stepped in front of Ennis. \u201cI killed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was not her fault. Claris had been tortured and starved,\u201d Ennis said. \u201cWhen she escaped from her tormentors, all mortals were her enemies. She killed any human who crossed her path. When I rose from my grave and I realized that I had become as she was, then I knew what I had to do.\u201d</p><p>Will planted his sword in the ground. \u201cSo you lied to her, and made her believe you were her father, and made her your servant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never deceived her.\u201d He walked over to Claris and stood beside her. \u201cI found her living like a beast in the forest. I tamed her and befriended her. I believe the fact that she was the one who changed me may have had something to do with it. I stayed with her, gentled her, and in time brought her back to her senses. When she understood what she had done, she asked how she could make amends for taking my life and the lives of all the humans she had slain. I asked her to pledge her life to me, and to help me to protect the innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took advantage of her guilt,\u201d Will snarled.</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, I gave her affection and purpose.\u201d He gave Will a haughty look. \u201cI kept her from becoming like you and your kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy using her to work for the Brethren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the moment I changed, I knew I could no longer serve the order. Nor could I allow myself or Claris to serve your kind. I realized there was no one to serve the mortals caught between the Kyn and the Brethren.\u201d He folded his hands in his sleeves. \u201cI found others, alone and frightened, with no one to guide them. Together we became the guardians of humanity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean you have been running about all this time doing good deeds for mortals?\u201d Lucan drawled. \u201cHow exceedingly tedious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather, I could not retrieve the book.\u201d Claris hunched her shoulders. \u201cGuisbourne took it to Rome. That is why Lord Locksley pursued him. He is to take it to the Contessa Borgiana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalvatora is dead, and the book rendered harmless,\u201d Ennis said. \u201cThe threat to the mortal world is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Will. \u201cI think I will leave it to your new friends to explain.\u201d He came to Claris and took her hands in his. \u201cI release you from your vow to me, Claris of Aubury. Your life is your own now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are going back to England, I hope?\u201d Lucan asked. \u201cAssuming my friend Will allows you to leave the building alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am no threat to you, assassin. Or you,\u201d he said to Will. \u201cI trust you will look after her.\u201d When Will nodded, Ennis kissed Claris\u2019s cheek. \u201cGod be with you always, my child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo quickly,\u201d Will advised him. \u201cBefore I think better of this.\u201d</p><p>Claris watched her father withdraw from the room, but it seemed a surreal thing, something out of the dreamlands. She turned slowly toward Will. \u201cI am free now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it would seem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I will go for a walk,\u201d Lucan announced, rising from the chair. \u201cI saw a lovely little Lotus at the other end of the street. Shouldn\u2019t be too terribly difficult to hot-wire.\u201d He smiled a little as both Claris and Will ignored him. \u201cI will see you both back at Rosethorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand why you deceived me,\u201d Will said. \u201cWhat I cannot fathom is why you never came to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not think you would believe that I was Claris of Aubury.\u201d She looked down at her body. \u201cThe only manner in which I can change shape is by taking the blood of the one I wish to mimic. I become that person\u2014appearance, voice, smell, talent, vulnerability\u2014everything an exact copy, down to the very blood in their veins. Then, if I wish to change again, I need blood from a different person, or I remain in the shape I last took.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot change back to who I was in the beginning,\u201d she said. \u201cI have none of my own blood.\u201d</p><p>Will reached into his pocket and took out the small leather pouch. \u201cI have carried this with me since the day I was to be executed. I kept it at first because of the scent you left upon it.\u201d Carefully he drew out a small, rotted bit of fabric, and handed it to her. \u201c\u2019Tis a piece of my sleeve. I used it that day to wipe the blood from your mouth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe blood is too old.\u201d She cradled it in her palm. \u201cIt cannot work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will not know,\u201d he said, \u201cunless you try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you love the woman I am now,\u201d Claris said. \u201cIf I keep this shape, you can have your Reese forever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is only one woman I have ever loved,\u201d he told her, \u201cand her memory is in your hands.\u201d</p><p>She reached for the bottle of wine on the table, and carefully wet the rag with a few drops before she brought it to her lips.</p><p>The shifting of her body happened much slower than before. She felt every inch of her hair as it grew out of her scalp, and every muscle that shrank and tightened. Reese\u2019s generous curves became her smaller, more modest form. She lost four inches in height, her spine shortening a fraction at a time.</p><p>She walked over to look into the mirror on the library wall. Reese\u2019s honey gold hair had turned to her own rich brown, falling over her shoulders to stream down her back. Her face hollowed, the cheekbones sharpening and her oval eyes narrowing and tilting down at the inner corners. Green and gold starbursts swept away the dark chocolate of her irises before a fringe of heavier, dark lashes shadowed them.</p><p>She expected it to hurt, but there was no pain. And when it was finished, she felt at ease in her skin for the first time in centuries.</p> <p>\u201cI forgot how small I was.\u201d She turned away from her reflection and held out her thin arms. \u201cAnd freckles. I had freckles.\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cAm I as I was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaris,\u201d he said, taking her into his arms. \u201cWe can never be who we were. We can only be who we are.\u201d He frowned. \u201cBut as I recall, there were nine freckles on your nose, not eight.\u201d</p><p>She still felt troubled. \u201cWhat about Reese?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReese was my friend,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are my love. And that, sweetheart, will never change.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
