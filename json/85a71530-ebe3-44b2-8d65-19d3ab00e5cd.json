On a scale of one to ten we're talking... a minus six. And it's not like I even have very high standards. Rain spatters down my collar as I shift from one blistered foot to the other. I'm holding my denim jacket over my head as a makeshift umbrella, but it's not exactly waterproof. I just want to find a taxi, get home, kick off these stupid boots, and run a nice hot bath. But we've been waiting here for ten minutes and there's no sign of a cab. My toes are agony. I'm never buying shoes from Cut-?Price Fashion again. I bought these boots last week in the sale (flat black patent; I only ever wear flats). They were half a size too small, but the girl said they would stretch and that they made my legs look really long. And I believed her. Honestly, I'm the world's biggest sucker.</p><p>We're all standing together on the corner of some street in southwest London that I've never been to 2 before, with music pounding faintly from the club below our feet. Carolyn's sister is a promoter and got us discounted entry, so that's why we schlepped all the way here. Only now we have to get home, and I'm the only one even looking for a cab.</p><p>Fi has commandeered the only nearby doorway and has her tongue down the throat of the guy she chatted up earlier at the bar. He's cute, despite the weird little mustache. Also, he's shorter than Fibut then, a lot of guys are, given she's nearly six feet tall. She has long dark hair and a wide mouth, and an oversized laugh to match. \u201cWhen Fi is really tickled by something, she brings the whole office to a standstill. A few feet away, Carolyn and Debs are sheltering underneath a newspaper arm in arm, caterwauling \u201dIt's Raining Men\u201c as if they're still on the karaoke stage. \u201dLexi!\u201c Debs yells, extending an arm for me to join in. \u201dIt's raining men!\u201c Her long blond hair is all ratty in the rain, but she's still bright-?faced. Debs's two favorite hobbies are karaoke and jewelry makingin fact, I'm wearing a pair of earrings she made me for my birthday: teeny silver Ls with dangling seed pearls. \u201dIt isn't bloody raining men!\u201c I call back morosely. \u201dIt's just raining!\" I normally love karaoke too. But I'm not in a singing mood tonight. I feel all sore inside, like I want to curl up away from everyone else. If only Loser Dave had turned up like he promised. After all those luv u Lexi texts; after vowing faithfully to be here at ten. I sat waiting all that time, watching the door, even when the other girls told me to give up on him. Now I feel like a sappy moron. Loser Dave works in car telesales and has been my boyfriend since we got together at Carolyn's friend's barbe 3 cue last summer. I don't call him Loser Dave to insult him it's just his nickname. No one remembers how he got it and he won't tell; in fact, he's always trying to make people call him something else. He started referring to himself as Butch a while ago, because he reckons he looks like Bruce Willis in Pulp Fiction. He has a buzz cut, I supposebut the resemblance ends there. Anyway, it didn't catch on. To his workmates he just is Loser Dave, the way I'm Snaggletooth. I've been called that since I was eleven. And sometimes Snagglehair. To be fair, my hair is pretty frizzy. And my teeth are kind of crooked. But I always say they give my face character.</p> <p>(Actually, that's a lie. It's Fi who says they give my face character. Personally, I'm planning to fix them, as soon as I've got the cash and can psych myself up to having braces in my mouthi.e., probably never.)</p><p>A taxi comes into sight and I immediately stick out my handbut some people ahead flag it down first. Great. I shove my hands in my pockets and miserably scan the rainy road for another yellow light.</p><p>It's not just Loser Dave standing me up that's bothering me: it's the bonuses. Today was the end of the financial year at work. Everyone was given paper slips saying how much they'd got and started jumping about with excitement, because it turns out the company's 2003-2004 sales were better than anyone expected. It was like Christmas came ten months early. Everyone was gabbing all afternoon about how they were going to spend the money. Carolyn started planning a holiday to New York with her boyfriend, Matt. Debs booked highlights at Nicky Clarkeshe's always wanted to go there. Fi called Harvey Nichols and reserved herself a new cool bag called a Paddington or something. And then there was me. With nada. Not because I haven't 4 worked hard, not because I didn't meet my targets, but because to get a bonus you have to have worked for the company for a year, and I missed qualifying by a week. One week. It's so unfair. It's so penny-?pinching. I'm telling you, if they asked me what I thought about it Anyway. Like Simon Johnson would ever ask the opinion of an associate junior sales manager (flooring). That's the other thing: I have the worst job title ever. It's embarrassing. It hardly even fits on my business card. The longer the title, I've decided, the crappier the job. They think they'll blind you with words and you won't notice you've been stuck in the corner of the office with the lousy accounts no one else wants to work on. A car splashes through a puddle near the pavement and I jump back, but not before a shower of water hits me in the face. From the doorway I can hear Fi hotting things up, murmuring into the ear of the cute guy. I catch a few familiar words and, despite my mood, have to clamp my lips together so I don't laugh. Months ago, we had a girls' night in, and ended up confessing all our dirty-?talk secrets. Fi said she uses the same line each time and it works a treat: \u201cI think my underwear's melting off.\u201d I mean. Would any guy fall for that? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Well, I guess, by Fi's record, they do. Debs confessed that the only word she can use without cracking up during sex is hot. So all she ever says is \u201cI'm hot.\u201d \u201cYou're so hot.\u201d \u201cThis is really hot.\u201d Mind you, when you're as stunning as Debs, I wouldn't think you'd need much of a repertoire. Carolyn has been with Matt for a million years and declared she never talks in bed at all except to say \u201cow\u201d or \u201chigher,\u201d or once, as he was about to come, \u201cOh crap, I left my hair straighteners on.\u201c I don't know if she really meant it; she's got a pretty quirky sense of humor, just like Matt. They're both superbrightalmost geekybut cool with it. When we're all out together the two of them throw so many insults at each other, it's hard to know if they're ever serious. I'm not sure even they know. Then it was my turn, and I told the truth, which is that I compliment the guy. Like, with Loser Dave, I always say \u201dYou have beautiful shoulders\u201c and \u201dYou have such beautiful eyes.\u201c I didn't admit that I say these things because I'm always secretly hoping to hear back from a guy that I'm beautiful too. Nor did I admit that it's never yet happened. Anyway. Whatever. \u201dHey, Lexi.\u201c I look up to see that Fi has unsuckered herself from the cute guy. She ducks under my denim jacket and gets out a lipstick. \u201dHi,\u201c I say, blinking rainwater off my lashes. \u201dWhere's lover boy gone?\u201c \u201dTo tell the girl he came with that he's leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFi!\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d Fi looks unrepentant. \u201cThey're not an item. Or much of one.\u201d She carefully redoes her mouth in pillar-?box red. \u201cI'm getting a whole new load of makeup,\u201d she says, frowning at the blunt end of the lipstick. \u201cChristian Dior, the whole lot. I can afford it now!\u201d \u201cYou should!\u201d I nod, trying to sound enthusiastic. A moment later Fi looks up with realization. \u201cOh, bollocks. Sorry, Lexi.\u201d She puts an arm around my shoulder and squeezes. \u201cYou should have got a bonus. It's not fair.\u201d 6 \u201cIt's fine.\u201d I try to smile. \u201cNext year.\u201d \u201cYou okay?\u201d Fi narrows her eyes at me. \u201cYou want to go for a drink or anything?\u201d \u201cNo, I need to get to bed. I've got an early start in the morning.\u201d Fi's face clears suddenly and she bites her lip. \u201cJesus. I forgot all about that, too. What with the bonuses and everything... Lexi, I'm sorry. This is a really shit time for you.\u201d \u201cIt's fine!\u201d I say at once. \u201cIt's... I'm trying not to make it a huge deal.\u201d No one likes a whinger. So somehow I make myself smile brightly, just to show I'm fine with being the snagglytoothed, stood-?up, no-?bonus girl whose dad just died. Fi is silent for a moment, her green eyes glittering in the passing headlights. \u201cThings'U turn around for you,\u201d she says. \u201cYou think?\u201d \u201cUh-?huh.\u201d She nods, with more energy. \u201cYou just have to believe it. Come on.\u201d She squeezes me. \u201cWhat are you, woman or walrus?\u201d Fi's been using that expression since we were both fifteen, and it makes me smile every time. \u201cAnd you know what?\u201d she adds. \u201cI think your dad would have wanted you to turn up to his funeral hungover.\u201d She met my dad a couple of times. She's probably right. \u201cHey, Lexi.\u201d Fi's voice is suddenly softer, and I brace myself. I'm in a pretty edgy mood as it is, and if she says something nice about my dad, I might cry. I mean, I didn't know him that well or anything, but you only get one dad \u201cDo you have a spare condom?\u201d Her voice pierces my thoughts. Right. So I probably didn't need to worry about the sympathy overload.</p><p>\u201cJust in case,\u201d she adds with a wicked grin. \u201cI mean, we'll probably just chat about world politics or whatever.\u201d \u201cYeah. I'm so sure.\u201d I root around inside my green birthday-?present Accessorize bag for the matching coin purse and produce a Durex, which I discreetly hand to her. \u201cThanks, babe.\u201d She kisses me on the cheek. \u201cListen, d'you want to come to mine tomorrow night? After it's all over? I'll make spaghetti carbonara.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d I smile gratefully. \u201cThat would be great. I'll call you.\u201d I'm already looking forward to it. A plate of delicious pasta, a glass of wine, and telling her all about the funeral. Fi can make the grimmest things seem funny...I know we'll end up in stitches. \u201cHey, there's a taxi! Taxiii!\u201d I hurry to the edge of the pavement as the cab pulls up and beckon to Debs and Carolyn, who are screeching out \u201cDancing Queen.\u201d Carolyn's glasses are spattered with raindrops, and she's about five notes ahead of Debs. \u201cHi there!\u201d I lean through the window to the taxi driver, my hair dripping down my face. \u201cCould you possibly take us first to Balham, and then\u201d \u201cSorry, love, no karaoke.\u201d The taxi driver cuts me off with a baleful glance at Debs and Carolyn. I stare at him, confused. \u201cWhat d'you mean, no karaoke?\u201d \u201cI'm not 'aving them girls in 'ere, doin' me 'ead in with their bloody singing.\u201d He has to be joking. You can't ban people for singing. \u201cBut\u201d \u201cMy cab, my rules. No drunks, no drugs, no karaoke.\u201d Before I can reply, he puts the taxi into gear and roars away down the road. \u201cYou can't have a 'no karaoke' rule!\u201d I shout after the 8 cab in outrage. \"It's... discrimination! It's against the law! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It's...\u201c I trail off helplessly and look around the pavement. Fi has disappeared back into Mr. Curie's arms. Debs and Carolyn are doing the worst \u201dDancing Queen\u201c routine I've ever seen; in fact, I don't blame that taxi driver. The traffic is whooshing by, drenching us with spray; rain is drumming through my denim jacket into my hair; thoughts are circling around my head like socks in a dryer. We'll never find a taxi. We'll be stuck out here in the rain all night. Those banana cocktails were noxiousI should have stopped after four. I have my dad's funeral tomorrow. I've never been to a funeral before. What if I start sobbing and everyone stares at me? Loser Dave's probably in bed with some other girl right this second, telling her she's beautiful while she moans \u201dButch! Butch!\u201c My feet are blistered and they're freezing \u201dTaxi!\u201c I instinctively scream the word, almost before I've registered the distant yellow light. It's coming up the road, signaling left. \u201dDon't turn!\u201c I wave frantically. \u201dOver here! Here!\u201c I have to get this cab. I have to. Clutching my denim jacket over my head, I run along the pavement, skidding slightly, yelling till I'm hoarse. \u201dTaxi! Taxi!\u201c As I reach the corner the pavement is crowded with people, and I skirt around them and up the steps to some grand municipal building. There's a balustraded platform with steps going right and left. I'll hail the taxi from up here, then run down and jump in. \u201dTAXI! TAAA-?XHI!\u201c Yes! It's pulling up. Thank God! At lastI can get home, run a bath, forget all about today. \u201dHere!\u201c I call out. \u201dJust coming, wait a sec\u201c To my consternation I notice a guy in a suit on the pave 9 ment below heading toward the taxi. \u201dIt's ours!\u201c I roar, and start pelting down the opposite steps. \u201dIt's ours! I hailed that cab! Don't you even dare Argh! Aaaaargh!\" Even as my foot skids on the wet step I'm not sure what's happening. Then, as I start falling, my thoughts rush with disbelief: I've slipped on my stupid, cheap, shiny-?soled boots. I'm tumbling right over, down the steps, like a threeyear-</p><p>old. I scrabble desperately at the stone balustrade, scraping my skin, wrenching my hand, dropping my Accessorize bag, grabbing for anything, but I can't stop myself Oh shit. The ground's coming straight toward methere's nothing I can dothis is really, really going to hurt...</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>How long have I been awake? Is it morning yet? I feel so rough. What happened last night? God, my head hurts. Okay, I'm never drinking again, ever.</p> <p>I feel so woozy I can't even think, let alone... Oww. How long have I been awake? My head is splitting and kind of foggy. And my mouth is parched. This is the most monster hangover I've ever had. I'm never drinking again, ever.</p><p>Is that a voice? No, I have to sleep... How long have I been awake? Five minutes? Half an hour, maybe? It's kind of hard to tell. What day is it, anyway? For a moment I just lie still. My head is pounding 12 with a rhythmic pain, like some sort of massive concretebreaker. I'm dry-?throated and aching all over. My skin feels like sandpaper. Where was I last night? What's wrong with my brain? It's like a fog has descended over everything. I'm never drinking again. I must have alcohol poisoning or something. I'm trying to remember last night as hard as I ' canbut all that's coming into my head is stupid stuff. Old memories and images from the past, flashing by in random order, like some kind of iPod shuffle in my brain. Sunflowers waving against a blue sky... Amy as a newborn baby, looking like a little pink sausage in a blanket...</p><p>A plate of salty french fries on a wooden pub table; hot sunshine on my neck; my dad sitting opposite in a Panama hat, blowing out cigar smoke and telling me, \u201cEat up, sweetheart\u201d...</p><p>The sack race at school. Oh God, not this memory again. I try to block it out, but too late, it's rushing in I'm seven years old, it's sports day, and I'm winning by miles, but it feels so uncomfortable to be out front that I stop and wait for all my friends. They catch upthen somehow in the melee I trip and wind up coming in last. I can still feel the humiliation, hear the laughter, feel the dust in my throat, the taste of bananas...</p><p>Hang on. Somehow I force my brain to hold steady for a moment. Bananas. Through the fog another memory is glimmering. I'm desperately trying to retrieve it, to reach for i t . ..</p> <p>Yes. Got it. Banana cocktails. We were drinking cocktails at some club. That's all I can remember. Bloody banana cocktails. What on earth did they put in them? I can't even open my eyes. They feel heavy and stuck down, like that time I used false eyelashes with dodgy glue from the market, then tottered into the bathroom the next morning to find one eye glued shut with what looked like a dead spider on top of it. Really attractive, Lexi. Cautiously, I move a hand up to my chest and hear a rustle of sheets. They don't sound like the ones at home. And there's a weird lemony smell in the air, and I'm wearing some soft cottony T-?shirt thing I don't recognize. Where am I? What on earth Hey. I didn't score, did I? Oh wow. Was I unfaithful to Loser Dave? Am I wearing some hot guy's oversize T-?shirt that I borrowed to sleep in after we had passionate sex all night and that's why I feel so bruised and sore No, I've never been unfaithful in my life. I must have stayed overnight with one of the girls or something. Maybe I'll get up, have a shower... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a huge effort I wrench my eyes open and incline my head a few inches. Shit. What the hell I'm lying in a dim room, on a metal bed. There's a panel of buttons to my right, a bunch of flowers on the nightstand. With an inward gulp I see an IV drip in my left hand, attached to a bag of fluid.</p><p>This is unreal. I'm in hospital. What's going on? What happened? I mentally prod my brain, but it's a big, stupid, empty balloon. I need a strong cup of coffee. I try peering around the room for cluesbut my eyes don't want to peer. They don't 14 want information, they want eyedrops and three aspirin. Feebly I flop back onto the pillows, close my eyes, and wait a few moments. Come on. I have to be able to remember what happened. I can't have been that drunk... can I? I'm holding on to my one fragment of memory like it's an island in the ocean. Banana cocktails... banana cocktails . . . think hard... think... Destiny's Child. Yes! A few more memories are coming back to me now. Slowly, slowly, in patches. Nachos with cheese. Those crummy bar stools with the vinyl all split. I was out with the girls from work. At that dodgy club with the pink neon ceiling i n . . . somewhere. I can remember nursing my cocktail, totally miserable. Why was I so down? What had happened Bonuses. Of course. A familiar cold disappointment clenches my stomach. And Loser Dave never showed up. Double whammy. But none of that explains why I'm in hospital. I screw up my face tight, trying to focus as hard as I can. I remember dancing like a maniac to Kylie and singing \u201cWe Are Family\u201d to the karaoke machine, all four of us, arm in arm. I can vaguely remember tottering out to get a cab. But beyond that... nothing. Total blanko. This is weird. I'll text Fi and ask her what happened. I reach toward the nightstandthen realize there's no phone there. Nor on the chair, or the chest of drawers. Where's my phone? Where's all my stuff gone? Oh God. Was I mugged? That has to be it. Some teenager in a hoodie clonked me over the head and I fell down in the street, and they must have called an ambulance and An even more horrendous thought grips me. What underwear was I wearing?</p><p>I can't help giving a small moan. This could be seriously bad. This could be the scaggy gray knickers and bra I only put on when the hamper is full. Or that faded lemon thong with the fraying edge and cartoon of Snoopy. It wouldn't have been anything posh. I mean, you wouldn't for Loser Daveit'd be a waste. Wincing, I swivel my head from side to sidebut I can't see any clothes or anything. The doctors must have incinerated them in the special Hospital Incinerator for Scaggy Underwear. And I still have no idea what I'm doing here. My throat's feeling really scratchy and I could die for a nice cool glass of orange juice. Now that I think of it, where are all the doctors and nurses? What if I were dying? \u201cHello?\u201d I call out feebly. My voice sounds like someone dragging a grater over a wooden floor. I wait for a response, but there's silence. I'm sure no one can hear me through that thick door. Then it occurs to me to press a button on the little panel. I select the one that looks like a person, and a few moments later the door opens. It worked! A gray-?haired nurse in a dark blue uniform enters and smiles at me. \u201cHello, Lexi!\u201d she says. \u201cFeeling all right?\u201d \u201cUm, okay, thanks. Thirsty. And my head hurts.\u201d \u201cI'll fetch you a painkiller.\u201d She brings me a plastic cup full of water and helps me up. \u201cDrink this.\u201d \u201cThanks,\u201d I say after gulping the water. \u201cSo...I'm guessing I'm in hospital? Or, like, a really high-?tech spa?\u201d The nurse smiles. \u201cSorry. Hospital. You don't remember how you got here?\u201c \u201dNo.\u201c I shake my head. \u201dI'm a bit hazy, to be honest.\u201c \u201dThat's because you had quite a bump on the head. Do you remember anything about your accident?\u201c Accident... accident... And suddenly, in a rush, it all 16 comes back. Of course. Running for the taxi, the paving stones wet with rain, slipping on my stupid cheap boots... Jeez Louise. I must have really bashed my head. \u201dYeah. I think so.\u201c I nod. \u201dKind of. So...what's the time?\u201c \u201dIt's eight o'clock at night.\u201c Eight o'clock? Wow. I've been out of it for a whole day? \u201dI'm Maureen.\u201c She takes the cup from me. \u201dYou were only transferred to this room a few hours ago. You know, we've already had several conversations.\u201c \u201dReally?\u201c I say, surprised. \u201dWhat did I say?\u201c \u201dYou were a little slurred, but you kept asking if something was 'baggy.'\u201c She frowns, looking perplexed. \u201dOr 'scaggy'?\u201c Great. Not only do I wear scaggy underwear, I talk about it to strangers. \u201dScaggy?\u201c I try to appear baffled. \u201dI've no idea what I meant.\u201c \u201dWell, you seem fully coherent now.\u201c Maureen plumps up my pillow. \u201dIs there anything else I can get you?\u201c \u201dI'd love some orange juice, if there is any. And I can't see my phone anywhere, or my bag.\u201c \u201dAll your valuables will have been put somewhere safe. I'll just check.\u201d She heads out and I look around the silent room, still dazed. I feel like I've put together only a tiny corner of the jigsaw puzzle. I still don't know which hospital I'm i n . . . how I got here... Has anyone told my family? And there's something else nagging at me like an undertow... I had been anxious to get home. Yes. That's right. I kept saying I needed to get home, because I had an early start the next day. Because Oh no. Oh fuck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My dad's funeral. It was the next day, eleven o'clock. Which means... Did I miss it? Instinctively I try to get out of bedbut even sitting up makes my head lurch. At last, reluctantly, I lie back down. If I've missed it, I've missed it. Nothing I can do about it now.</p><p>It's not like I really knew my dad well. He was never around that much; in fact, he felt more like an uncle. The kind of jokey, roguish uncle who brings you sweets at Christmas and smells of drink and cigarettes. Nor was it a massive shock him dying. He was having some big heart bypass operation, and everyone knew there was a 50-50 risk. But still, I should have been there today, along with Mum and Amy. I mean, Amy's only twelve and a timid little twelve at that. I suddenly have a vision of her sitting in the crematorium next to Mum, all grave under her Shetland pony fringe, clutching her raggedy old Blue Lion. She's not ready to see her dad's coffin, not without her big sister to hold her hand. As I lie there, imagining her trying to look brave and grown up, I suddenly feel a tear rolling down my face. It's the day of my dad's funeral, and here I am in hospital with a headache and probably a broken leg or something. And my boyfriend stood me up last night. And no one's come to visit me, I suddenly realize. Where's all my anxious friends and family, sitting around the bed and holding my hand? Well, I suppose Mum's been at the funeral with Amy. And Loser Dave can sod off. But Fi and the otherswhere are they? When I think how we all went to visit Debs when 18 she had her ingrown toenail removed. We all practically camped on the floor, and brought her Starbucks and magazines, and treated her to a pedicure when it was healed. Just for a toenail. Whereas I've been unconscious, with an IV drip and everything. But obviously no one cares. Great. Just bloody... brilliant. Another fat tear trickles down my face, just as the door opens and Maureen comes in again. She's holding a tray and a plastic bag with Lexi Smart written on it in thick marker. \u201cOh dear!\u201d she says as she sees me wiping my eyes. \u201cIs the pain very bad?\u201d She hands me a tablet and a little cup of water. \u201cThis should help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks very much.\u201d I gulp down the pill. \u201cBut it's not that. It's my life.\u201d I spread my arms hopelessly. \u201cIt's total rubbish, from start to finish.\u201d \u201cOf course it's not,\u201d Maureen says reassuringly. \u201cThings might look bad\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, they are bad.\u201d \u201cI'm sure\u201d \u201cMy so-?called career is going nowhere, and my boyfriend stood me up last night, and I haven't got any money. And my sink keeps leaking rancid brown water into the flat below,\u201d I add, remembering with a shudder. \u201cI'll probably get sued by my neighbors. And my dad just died.\u201d There's silence. Maureen looks flummoxed. \u201cWell, that does all sound rather...tricky,\u201d she says at last. \u201cBut I expect things will soon turn around for the better.\u201d \u201cThat's what my friend Fi said!\u201d I suddenly have a memory of Fi's eyes shining in the rain. \u201cAnd look, I end up in hospital!\u201c I make a despairing gesture at myself. \u201dHow is this turning around for the better?\u201c \u201dI'm... not sure, dear.\u201c Maureen's eyes are darting helplessly from side to side. \u201dEvery time I think everything's crap... it just gets even crapper!\u201c I blow my nose and heave a massive sigh. \u201dWouldn't it be great if just once, just one time, life fell magically into place?\u201c \u201dWell, we can all hope, can't we?\u201d Maureen gives me a sympathetic smile and holds out her hand for the cup. I pass it backand as I do so, I suddenly notice my nails. Bloody hell. What on earth My nails have always been bitten-?down stumps that I try to hide. But these look amazing. All neat and varnished pale pink... and long. I blink at them in astonishment, trying to work out what's happened. Did we go for a latenight manicure last night or something and I've forgotten? Did I get acrylics? They must have some brilliant new technique, because I can't see the join or anything. \u201cYour handbag's in here, by the way,\u201d Maureen adds, putting the plastic bag on my bed. \u201cI'll just go and get you that juice.\u201d \u201cThanks.\u201d I look at the plastic bag in surprise. \u201cAnd thanks for the bag. I thought it had been nicked.\u201d That's something good, anyway, to have got my bag back. With any luck my phone will still be charged up and I can send a few texts As Maureen opens the door to leave, I reach into the shopping bagand pull out a smart Louis Vuitton tote with calfskin handles, all glossy and expensive-?looking. Oh, great. I sigh in disappointment. This isn't my bag. They've got me mixed up with someone else. Like I, Lexi Smart, would possess a Louis Vuitton bag. 20 \u201cExcuse me, this bag isn't mine,\u201d I call out, but the door has already closed. I gaze at the Louis Vuitton wistfully for a while, wondering who it belongs to. Some rich girl down the corridor, must be. At last I drop it onto the floor, flop back on my pillows, and close my eyes.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 2</p><p>I wake up to find chinks of morning light edging underneath the drawn curtains. A glass of orange juice is on the nightstand and Maureen is bustling about in the corner of the room. The IV drip has magically disappeared, and I feel a lot more normal.</p><p>\u201cHi, Maureen,\u201d I say, my voice scratchy. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d She turns around, her eyebrows raised. \u201cYou remember me?\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d I say in surprise. \u201cWe met last night. We talked.\u201d \u201cExcellent! That shows you've come out of posttraumatic amnesia. Don't look alarmed!\u201d she adds, smiling. \u201cIt's a normal stage of confusion after a head injury.\u201d Instinctively I put my hand up to my head and feel a dressing. Wow. I must really have whacked it on those steps. \u201cYou're doing well.\u201d She pats my shoulder. \u201cI'll get you some fresh orange juice.\u201d There's a knock at the door. It opens and a tall, 22 slim woman in her fifties comes in. She has blue eyes, high cheekbones, and wavy, graying blond hair in straggly layers. She's wearing a red quilted waistcoat over a long printed dress and an amber necklace, and she's holding a paper bag. It's Mum. I mean, I'm ninety-?nine percent certain it is. I don't know why I'm even hesitating.</p><p>\u201cThe heating in this place!\u201d she exclaims in her familiar thin, little-?girl voice. Okay, it's definitely Mum. \u201cI feel quite faint!\u201d She fans herself. \u201cAnd I had such a stressful journey....\u201d She glances toward the bed almost as an afterthought, and says to Maureen, \u201cHow is she?\u201d Maureen smiles. \u201cLexi's much better today. Far less confused than she was yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank goodness for that!\u201d Mum lowers her voice a fraction. \u201cIt was like talking to a lunatic yesterday, or some... retarded person.\u201d \u201cLexi isn't a lunatic,\u201d says Maureen evenly, \u201cand she can understand everything you say.\u201d</p><p>The truth is, I'm barely listening. I can't help staring at Mum. What's wrong with her? She looks different. Thinner. And kind of... older. As she comes nearer and the light from the window falls on her face, she looks even worse. Is she ill? No. I'd know about it if she was ill. But honestly, she seems to have aged overnight. I'll buy her some Creme de la Mer for Christmas, I resolve. \u201cHere you are, darling,\u201d she says in overly loud, clear tones. \u201cIt's me. Your mo-?ther.\u201d She hands me the paper bag, which contains a bottle of shampoo, and drops a kiss on my cheek. As I inhale her familiar smell of dogs and tearose perfume, it's ridiculous, but I feel tears rising. I hadn't realized quite how marooned I felt. \u201cHi, Mum.\u201d I reach to hug herbut my arms hit thin air. She's already turned away and is consulting her tiny gold watch. \u201cI can't stay more than a minute, I'm afraid,\u201d she says with a kind of tension, as though if she lingers too long the world will explode. \u201cI'm due to see a specialist about Roly.\u201d \u201cRoly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Smoky's latest litter, darling.\u201d Mum shoots me a glance of reproach. \u201cYou remember little Roly.\u201d I don't know how Mum expects me to keep track of all her dogs' names. There's at least twenty of them and they're all whippets, and every time I go home there seems to be another one. We were always an animal-?free familyuntil the summer when I was seventeen. While on holiday in Wales, Mum bought a whippet puppy on a whim. And overnight it triggered this total mania.</p><p>I do like dogs. Kind of. Except when six of them jump up at you every time you open the front door. And whenever you try to sit down on a sofa or a chair, there's a dog on it. And all the biggest presents under the Christmas tree are for the dogs.</p><p>Mum has taken a bottle of Rescue Remedy out of her bag. She squeezes three drops onto her tongue, then breathes out sharply. \u201cThe traffic coming here was terrible,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople in London are so aggressive. I had a very unpleasant altercation with a man in a van.\u201d \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I say, already knowing that Mum will shake her head. \u201cLet's not talk about it, darling.\u201d She winces, as though 24 being asked to recall her days of terror in the concentration camp. \u201cLet's just forget about it.\u201d Mum finds a lot of things too painful to talk about. Like how my new sandals could have got mangled last Christmas. Or the council's continual complaints about dog mess in our street. Or, to be honest, mess in general. In life. \u201cI've got a card for you,\u201d she says, rooting in her bag. \u201cWhere is it, now? From Andrew and Sylvia.\u201d I stare at her, bemused. \u201cWho?\u201d \u201cAndrew and Sylvia, next door!\u201d she says, as though it's obvious. \u201cMy neighbors!\u201d Her next-?door neighbors aren't called Andrew and Sylvia. They're Philip and Maggie. \u201cMum\u201d \u201cAnyway, they send their love,\u201d she says, interrupting me. \u201cAnd Andrew wants to ask your advice on skiing.\u201d Skiing? I don't know how to ski.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMum...\u201d I put a hand to my head, forgetting about my injury, and wince. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d \u201cHere we are!\u201d Maureen comes back into the room, bearing a glass of orange juice. \u201cDr. Harman's just coming along to check you over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must go, darling.\u201d Mum gets to her feet. \u201cI left the car on some extortionate parking meter. And the congestion charge! Eight pounds I had to pay!\u201d That's not right either. The congestion charge isn't eight pounds. I'm sure it's only five quid, not that I ever use a car My stomach plunges. Oh my GodMum's getting dementia. That has to be it. She's already going senile, at the age of fifty-?four. I'll have to speak to one of the doctors about her.</p><p>\u201cI'll be back later with Amy and Eric,\u201d she says, heading to the door. Eric? She really calls her dogs some odd names. \u201cOkay, Mum.\u201d I smile brightly, to humor her. \u201cCan't wait.\u201d As I sip my juice I feel a bit shaken up. Everyone thinks their mum is a bit crazy. But that was seriously crazy. What if she has to go into a home? What will I do with all the dogs? My thoughts are interrupted by a knock at the door, and a youngish doctor with dark hair enters, followed by three other people in medical uniforms. \u201cHello there, Lexi,\u201d he says in a pleasant, brisk manner. \u201cI'm Dr. Harman, one of the resident neurologists here. These are Nicole, a specialist nurse, and Diana and Garth, our two trainee doctors. So, how are you feeling?\u201d \u201cFine! Except my left hand feels a bit weird,\u201d I admit. \u201cLike I've been sleeping on it and it isn't working properly.\u201d As I lift up my hand to show him, I can't help admiring my amazing manicure again. I must ask Fi where we went last night. \u201cRight.\u201d The doctor nods. \u201cWe'll take a look at that; you may need some therapy. But first I'm going to ask you a few questions. Bear with me if some of them seem blindingly obvious.\u201c He flashes a professional smile and I get the feeling he's said all this a thousand times before. \u201dCan you tell me your name?\u201c \u201dMy name's Lexi Smart,\u201c I reply promptly. Dr. Harman nods and adds a tick mark in his folder. \u201dAnd when were you born?\u201c \u201dNineteen seventy-?nine.\u201c 26 \u201dVery good.\u201c He makes another note. \u201dNow, Lexi, when you crashed your car, you bumped your head against the windshield. There was a small amount of swelling to your brain, but it looks as though you've been very lucky. I still need to do some checks, though.\u201c He holds up his pen. \u201dIf you'd like to look at the top of this pen, I'm going to move it from side to side.\u201c Doctors don't let you get a word in, do they? \u201dExcuse me!\u201c I wave at him. \u201dYou've mixed me up with someone else. I didn't crash any car.\u201c Dr. Harman frowns and flips back two pages in his folder. \u201dIt says the patient was involved in a traffic accident.\u201c He looks around the room for confirmation. Why is he asking them? I'm the one it happened to. \u201dWell, they must have written it down wrong,\u201c I say firmly. \u201dI was out clubbing with my friends and we were running for a taxi and I fell. That's what happened. I remember it really well.\u201c Dr. Harman and Maureen exchange puzzled looks. \u201dIt was definitely a traffic accident,\u201c murmurs Maureen. \u201dTwo vehicles, side-?on. I was down in Emergency and I saw her come in. And the other driver. I think he had a minor arm fracture.\u201c \u201dI couldn't have been in a car crash.\u201c I try to keep my patience. \u201dFor a start, I don't have a car. I don't even know how to drive!\u201c I'm intending to learn to drive one day. It's just that I've never needed to since living in London, and lessons are so expensive, and it's not like I can afford a car. \u201dYou haven't got a...\u201c Dr. Harman flips over a page and squints at the writing. \u201dA Mercedes convertible?\u201c \u201dA Mercedes?\u201c I snort with laughter. \u201dAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it says here\u201d 27 \u201cLook.\u201d I cut him off as politely as I can. \u201cI'll tell you how much twenty-?five-?year-?old sales associates at Deller Carpets earn, okay? And you tell me if I can afford a Mercedes convertible.\u201d Dr. Harman opens his mouth to answerbut is interrupted by one of the trainees, Diana, who taps his shoulder. She scribbles something on my notes and Dr. Harman's mouth snaps open again in shock. His eyes meet the trainee's; she raises her eyebrows, glances at me, then points at the paper again. They look like a pair of mime-?school rejects. Now Dr. Harman is coming closer and gazing intently at me with a grave expression. My stomach starts flipflopping. I've seen ER, I know what that expression means. Lexi, we did a scan and we saw something we weren't expecting to find. It could be nothing. Except it's never nothing, is it? Otherwise why would you be on the show? \u201cIs something really wrong with me?\u201d I say almost aggressively, trying to suppress the sudden wobble of terror in my voice. \u201cJust tell me, okay?\u201d My mind is already ripping through the possibilities. Cancer. Hole in the heart. Lose a leg. Maybe I've already lost a legthey just didn't want to tell me. Surreptitiously I feel through the blankets. \u201cLexi, I want to ask you another question.\u201d Dr. Harman's voice is gentler. \u201cCan you tell me what year it is?\u201d \u201cWhat year it is?\u201d I stare at him, thrown. \u201cDon't be alarmed,\u201d he says reassuringly. \u201cJust tell me what year you think it is. It's one of our standard checks.\u201d I look from face to face. I can tell they're playing some kind of trick on me, but I can't work out what. \u201cIt's 2004,\u201d I say at last. 28 There's a weird stillness in the room, as if no one wants to breathe. \u201cOkay.\u201d Dr. Harman sits down on the bed. \u201cLexi, today is May 6,2007.\u201d His face is serious. All the others appear serious too. For an instant a frightening chink seems to open up in my brainbut then, with a rush of relief, I get it. This is a windup! \u201cHa-?ha.\u201d I roll my eyes. \u201cVery funny. Did Fi put you up to this? Gr Carolyn?\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don't know anyone called Fi or Carolyn,\u201d Dr. Harman replies without breaking his gaze. \u201cAnd I'm not joking.\u201d \u201cHe's serious, Lexi,\u201d one of the trainees chimes in. \u201cWe're in 2007.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut... that's the future\u201d I say stupidly. \u201cAre you saying they've invented time machines?\u201d I force a little laugh, but no one else joins in. \u201cLexi, this is bound to be a shock,\u201d Maureen says kindly, putting a hand on my shoulder. \u201cBut it's true. It's May 2007.\u201d</p><p>I feel as if the two sides of my brain aren't connecting or something. I can hear what they're saying, but it's just ludicrous. Yesterday it was 2004. How can we have jumped three years? \u201cLook, it can't be 2007,\u201d I say at last, trying not to give away how rattled I am. \u201cIt's 2004. I'm not stupid\u201d \u201cDon't get upset,\u201d Dr. Harman says, sending warning glances to the others. \u201cLet's take this slowly. Why don't you tell us what you last remember?\u201d \u201cOkay, well...\u201d I rub my face. \"The last thing I remember is going out with some friends from work last night. Friday night. We went clubbing... and then we were trying to get a taxi in the rain and I slipped on the steps and fell. And I woke up in hospital. That was February 20, 2004.\u201c My voice is trembling. \u201dI know the date exactly, because it was my dad's funeral the next day! I missed it, because I'm stuck here!\u201c \u201dLexi, all of that happened more than three years ago,\u201c Maureen says softly. \u201dYou're remembering the wrong accident.\u201c She seems so sure. They all seem so sure. Panic is rising inside me as I look at their faces. It's 2 0 0 4 , I know it is. It feels like 2004. \u201dWhat else do you remember?\u201c asks Dr. Harman. \u201dWorking back from that night.\u201c \u201dI don't know,\u201c I say defensively. \u201dBeing at work...</p><p>moving into my flat... everything!\u201c \u201dIs your memory foggy at all?\u201c \u201dA...a bit,\u201c I admit reluctantly as the door opens. The trainee named Diana left the room a moment ago and now she's back, holding a copy of the Daily Mail. She approaches the bed and glances at Harman. \u201dShould I?\u201c \u201dYes.\u201c He nods. \u201dThat's a good idea.\u201c \u201dLook, Lexi.\u201c She points to the dateline at the top. \u201dThis is today's paper.\u201c I feel a massive jolt of shock as I read the date: May 6, 2007. But I mean... that's just words printed on paperit doesn't prove anything. I look farther down the page, at a photograph of Tony Blair. \u201dGod, he's aged!\u201c I exclaim before I can stop myself. Just like Mum flashes through my mind, and a sudden coldness trickles down my spine. But... that doesn't prove anything either. Maybe the light was just unflattering. Hands trembling, I turn the page. There's total silence in 30 the room; everyone is watching me, agog. My gaze travels uncertainly over a few headlinesInterest rates to rise... Queen on States visitthen is drawn by a bookshop ad. Half price on all fantasy, including Harry Potter and the Half-?Blood Prince. Okay. Now my skin is really prickling. I've read all the Harry Potter books, all five of them. I don't remember any half-?blood prince. \u201dWhat's this?\u201c Trying to sound casual, I point at the ad. \u201dWhat's Harry Potter and the Half-?Blood Prince?\u201c \u201dThat's the latest book,\u201c Garth, the other trainee, says. \u201dIt came out ages ago.\u201c I can't help gasping. \u201dThere's a sixth Harry Potter?\u201c \u201dThere's a seventh out soon!\u201c Diana steps forward eagerly. \u201dAnd guess what happens at the end of book six\u201c \u201dShh!\u201c exclaims Nicole, the other nurse. \u201dDon't tell her!\" They continue bickering, but I don't hear them anymore. I stare at the newspaper print until it jumps about in front of my eyes. That's why nothing made sense. It's not Mum who's confusedit's me. \u201cSo I've been lying here in a coma\u201dI swallow hard \u201cfor three years?\u201d I can't believe it. I've been Coma Girl. Everyone's been waiting for me to wake up for three whole years. The world's been going on without me. My family and friends have probably made me tapes, kept vigils, sung songs, and everything But Dr. Harman is shaking his head. \u201cNo, that's not it. Lexi, you were only admitted five days ago.\u201d What?</p> <p>Enough. I can't cope with this anymore. I came into hospital five days ago in 2004but now magically it's 2007? Where are we, bloody Narnia? \u201cI don't understand!\u201d I say helplessly, thrusting the paper aside. \u201cAm I hallucinating? Have I gone crazy?\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d Dr. Harman says emphatically. \u201cLexi, I think you're suffering from what we call retrograde amnesia. It's a condition which normally arises following head injuries, but it seems that yours might be quite lengthy.\u201d He carries on speaking, but his words aren't fixing properly in my brain. As I look around at the staff, I suddenly feel suspicion. They look fake. These aren't real medical professionals, are they? Is this a real hospital? \u201cHave you stolen my kidney?\u201d My voice erupts in a panicky growl. \u201cWhat have you done to me? You can't keep me here. I'm calling the police \u201d I try to struggle out of bed. \u201cLexi.\u201d Nicole holds me by the shoulders. \u201cNo one's trying to hurt you. Dr. Harman's speaking the truth. You've lost your memory and you're confused.\u201d \u201cIt's natural for you to panic, to believe that there's some kind of conspiracy. But we're telling you the truth.\u201d Dr. Harman looks me firmly in the eyes. \u201cYou've forgotten a chunk of your life, Lexi. You've forgotten. That's all.\u201d I want to cry. I can't tell if they're lying, if this is all some massive trick, whether I should trust them or make a run for it My head's whirling with confusion Then suddenly I freeze. My hospital-?gown sleeve got hitched up as I was struggling and I've just spotted a small, distinctive V-?shaped scar near my elbow. A scar I've never seen before. A scar I don't recognize. It's not new, either. It must be months old. 32 \u201cLexi, are you all right?\u201d asks Dr. Harman. I can't reply. My eyes are riveted on the unfamiliar scar. Heart thumping, I slowly move my gaze down to my hands. These nails aren't acrylics, are they? Acrylics aren't that good. These are my real, genuine nails. And there's no way they could have grown this long in five days. I feel like I've swum out of the shallows and found myself in mile-?deep gray water. \u201cYou're saying\u201dI clear my hoarse throat\u201cI've lost three years of my memory.\u201d \u201cWell, it's difficult to be precise, but that's what it looks like at the moment.\u201d Dr. Harman nods. \u201cCan I see the newspaper again, please?\u201d My hands are trembling as I take it from Diana. I turn over the pages and every single one has the same dateline. May 6,2007. May 6, 2007. It really is the year 2007. Which means I must b e . . . Oh my God. I'm twenty-?eight. I'm old. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 3</p><p>They've made me a nice strong cup of tea.

Maureen has gone off duty and Nicole has stayed in the room and is scribbling on my chart. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d 34 \u201cReally, really... really weird.\u201d I try to smile. \u201cI don't blame you.\u201d She smiles back sympathetically. \u201cJust take it easy. Don't push yourself. You've got a lot to take in. Your brain is trying to reboot itself.\u201d She consults her watch and writes down the time. \u201cWhen people get amnesia,\u201d I venture, \u201cdo the missing memories come back?\u201d \u201cUsually.\u201d She gives a reassuring nod. I shut my eyes tight and try throwing my mind back as hard as I can. Waiting for it to net something, snag on something. But there's nothing. Just black, frictionless nothing. \u201cSo, tell me about 2007.\u201d I open my eyes. \u201cWho's prime minister now? And president of America?\u201d \u201cThat would be Tony Blair,\u201d replies Nicole. \u201cAnd President Bush.\u201d \u201cOh. Same.\u201d I cast around. \u201cSo...have they solved global warming? Or cured AIDS?\u201d Nicole shrugs. \u201cNot yet.\u201d You'd think a bit more would have happened in three years. You'd think the world would have moved on. I'm a bit unimpressed by 2007, to be honest. \u201cWould you like a magazine?\u201d Nicole asks. \u201cI'm just going to sort you out some breakfast.\u201d She disappears out of the door, then returns and hands me a copy of Hello! I run my eyes down the headlinesand feel a jolt of shock. \u201c 'Jennifer Aniston and Her New Man.'\u201d I read the words aloud uncertainly. \u201cWhat new man? Why would she need a new man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes.\u201d Nicole follows my gaze, unconcerned. \u201cYou know she split up from Brad Pitt?\u201d \u201cJennifer and Brad split?\u201d I stare up at her, aghast. \u201cYou can't be serious! They can't have done!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe went off with Angelina Jolie. They've got a daughter.\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d I wail. \u201cBut Jen and Brad were so perfect together! They looked so good, and they had that lovely wedding picture and everything \u201d \u201cThey're divorced now.\u201d Nicole shrugs, like it's no big deal. I can't get over this. Jennifer and Brad are divorced. The world is a different place. \u201cEveryone's pretty much got used to it.\u201d Nicole pats my shoulder soothingly. \u201cI'll get you some breakfast. Would you like full English, continental, or fruit basket? Or all three?\u201d \u201cUm... continental, please. Thanks very much.\u201d I open the magazine, then put it down again. \u201cHang on. Fruit basket? Did the NHS suddenly get a load of money or something?\u201d \u201cThis isn't NHS.\u201d She smiles. \u201cYou're in the private wing.\u201d Private? I can't afford to go private. \u201cI'll just refresh your tea...\u201d She picks up the smart china pot and starts to pour. \u201cStop!\u201d I exclaim in panic. I can't have any more tea. It probably costs fifty quid a cup. \u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Nicole says in surprise. \u201cI can't afford all this,\u201d I say in an embarrassed rush. \u201cI'm sorry, I don't know why I'm in this posh room. I should have been taken to an NHS hospital. I'm happy to move...\u201d \u201cIt's all covered by your private health insurance,\u201d she says. \u201cDon't worry.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d I say, taken aback. \u201cOh, right.\u201d I took out private health insurance? Well, of course I did. I'm twenty-?eight now. I'm sensible. 36 I'm twenty-?eight years old. It hits me right in the stomach, as though for the first time. I'm a different person. I'm not me anymore. I mean, obviously I'm still me. But I'm twenty-?eight-?yearold me. Whoever the hell that is. I peer at my twenty-?eightyear- old hand as though for clues. Someone who can afford private health insurance, obviously, and gets a really good manicure, and... Wait a minute. Slowly I turn my head and focus again on the glossy Louis Vuitton. No. It's not possible. This zillion-?pound, designer, moviestar- type bag couldn't really be \u201cNicole?\u201d I swallow, trying to sound nonchalant. \u201cD'you think... Is that bag... mine?\u201d \u201cShould be.\u201d Nicole nods. \u201cI'll just check for you...\u201d She opens the bag, pulls out a matching Louis Vuitton wallet, and snaps it open. \u201cYes, it's yours.\u201d She turns the wallet around to display a platinum American Express card with Lexi Smart printed across it. My brain is short-?circuiting as I stare at the embossed letters. That's my platinum credit card. This is my bag. \u201cBut these bags cost, like... a thousand quid.\u201d My voice is strangled. \u201cI know they do.\u201d Nicole suddenly laughs. \u201cGo on, relax. It's yours!\u201d Gingerly I stroke the handle, hardly daring to touch it. I can't believe this belongs to me. I mean... where did I get it? Am I earning loads of money or something? \u201cSo, I was really in a car crash?\u201d I look up, suddenly wanting to know everything about myself, all at once. \u201cI was really driving? In a Mercedes?\u201d \u201cApparently.\u201d She takes in my expression of disbelief. \u201cDidn't you have a Mercedes in 2004, then?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you joking? I can't even drive!\u201d When did I learn to drive? When did I suddenly start to afford designer handbags and Mercedes cars, for God's sake? \u201cLook in your bag,\u201d suggests Nicole. \u201cMaybe the things inside will jog your memory.\u201d \u201cOkay. Good idea.\u201d There are flutters in my stomach as I pull open the bag. A smell of leather, mixed with some unfamiliar perfume, rises from the inside. I reach inand the first thing I pull out is a tiny gold-?plated Estee Lauder compact. At once I flip it open to have a look. \u201cYou've had some cuts to the face, Lexi,\u201d Nicole says quickly. \u201cDon't be alarmedthey'll heal.\u201d As I meet my own eyes in the tiny mirror, I feel sudden relief. It's still me, even if there's a huge graze on my eyelid. I move the mirror about, trying to get a good view, flinching as I see the bandage on my head. I tilt it farther down: there are my lips, looking weirdly full and pink, as if I was snogging all last night, and Oh my God. Those aren't my teeth. They're all white. They're all gleamy. I'm looking at a stranger's mouth. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Nicole interrupts my daze. \u201cLexi?\u201d \u201cI'd like a proper mirror, please,\u201d I manage at last. \u201cI need to see myself. Have you got one you could bring me?\u201d \u201cThere's one in the bathroom.\u201d She comes forward. \u201cIn fact, it's a good idea for you to get moving. I'll help you.\u201d I heave myself out of the high metal bed. My legs are wobbly, but I manage to totter into the adjoining bathroom. \u201cNow,\u201d she says, before she closes the door. \u201cYou have had some cuts and bruising, so your appearance may be a little bit of a shock. Are you ready?\u201d 38 \u201cYes. I'll be fine. Just show me.\u201d I take a deep breath and steel myself. She swings the door shut to reveal a full-?length mirror on the back of it. Is that... me? I can't speak. My legs have turned to jelly. I grip a towel rail, trying to keep control of myself. \u201cI know your injuries look bad.\u201d Nicole has a strong arm around me. \u201cBut believe me, they're just surface wounds.\u201d I'm not even looking at the cuts. Or the bandage or the staple on my forehead. It's what's underneath. \u201cThat's not...\u201d I gesture at my reflection. \u201cThat's not what I look like.\u201d I close my eyes and visualize my old self, just to make sure I'm not going crazy. Mouse-?colored frizzy hair, blue eyes, slightly fatter than I'd like to be. Nice-?ish face but nothing special. Black eyeliner and bright pink Tesco lipstick. The standard Lexi Smart look. Then I open my eyes again. A different girl is staring back at me. Some of my hair has been messed up by the crash, but the rest is a bright, unfamiliar shade of chestnut, all straight and sleek with not one bit of frizz. My toenails are perfectly pink and polished. My legs are tanned golden brown, and thinner than before. And more muscled. \u201cWhat's changed?\u201d Nicole is looking at my reflection curiously. \u201cEverything!\u201d I manage. \u201cI look all... sheeny.\u201d \u201cSheeny?\u201d She laughs. \u201cMy hair, my legs, my teeth...\u201d I can't take my eyes off those immaculate pearly whites. They must have cost a bloody fortune. \u201cThey're nice!\u201d She nods politely. \u201cNo. No. No.\u201d I'm shaking my head vigorously. \u201cYou don't understand. I have the worst teeth in the world. My nickname is 'Snaggletooth.'\u201c \u201dShouldn't think it is anymore.\u201c Nicole raises an amused eyebrow. \u201dAnd I've lost loads of weight And my face is different; I'm not sure exactly how...\u201c I scan my features, trying to work it out. My eyebrows are thin and groomed... my lips seem fuller somehow.... I peer more closely, suddenly suspicious. Have I had something done? Have I turned into someone who has work done? I tear myself away from the mirror and pull the door open, my head spinning. \u201dTake it easy,\u201c Nicole warns, hurrying after me. \u201dYou've had a shock to the system. Maybe you should take things one step at a time \u201d Ignoring her, I grab the Louis Vuitton bag and start yanking things out of it, examining each item closely as though it might impart a message. God, just look at this stuff. A Tiffany key fob, a pair of Prada sunglasses, a lip gloss: Lancome, not Tesco. And here's a small, pale-?green Smythson diary. I hesitate for a moment, psyching myself upthen open it. With a jolt I see my own familiar handwriting. Lexi Smart, 2007 is scribbled inside the front cover. I must have written those words. I must have doodled that feathery bird in the corner. But I have absolutely no recollection of doing so.</p><p>Feeling as if I'm spying on myself, I start leafing through the tiny pages. There are appointments on every page: Lunch 12:30. Drinks P. Meeting Gillartwork. But they're all written in initials and abbreviations. I can't glean much from this. I flick onward to the end and a bunch of business cards falls out of the diary. I pick one up, glance down at the name-?and freeze. It's a card from the company I work at, Deller Carpets although it's been given a trendy new logo. And the name is printed in clear charcoal gray. LEXI SMART DIRECTOR, FLOORING I feel as though the ground has fallen away from me. \u201cLexi?\u201d Nicole is regarding me in concern. \u201cYou've gone very pale.\u201d \u201cLook at this.\u201d I hold the card out, trying to keep a grip on myself. \u201cIt says 'director' on my business card. That's, like, boss of the whole department. How could I possibly be the boss?\u201d My voice rises more shrilly than I intended. \u201cI've only been at the company a year. I didn't even get a bonus!\u201d Hands trembling, I slot the card back between the diary pages and reach into the bag again. I have to find my phone. I have to call my friends, my family, someone who knows what's going on Got it. It's a sleek new model that I don't recognize, but it's still pretty simple to work out. I haven't got any voice messages, although there's a new unread text. I select it and peer at the tiny screen. Running late, I'll call when I can. E. Who's \u201cE\u201d? I rack my brains but can't think of a single person I know whose name begins with E. Someone new at work? I go to my stored textsand the first one is from \u201cE\u201d: I don't think so. E. 41 Is \u201cE\u201d my new best friend or something? I'll trawl through my messages later. Right now I have to talk to someone who knows me, who can tell me exactly what's been going on in my life these last three years... I speed-?dial Fi's number and wait, drumming my nails, for a reply. \u201cHi, you've reached Fiona Roper. Please leave a message.\u201d \u201cHey, Fi,\u201d I say as soon as the beep sounds. \u201cIt's me, Lexi! Listen, I know this'U sound weird, but I've had an accident. I'm in hospital and I just... I need to talk to you. It's quite important. Can you give me a call? Bye!\u201d As I close the phone, Nicole puts a hand on it reprovingly. \u201cYou're not supposed to use these in here,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can use a landline, though. I'll set you up with a receiver.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d I nod. \u201cThanks.\u201d I'm about to start scrolling through all my old texts, when there's a knock on the door and another nurse comes in, holding a pair of bags. \u201cI've got your clothes here.\u201d She puts a shopping bag down on my bed. I reach in, pull out a pair of dark jeans, and stare at them. What are these? The waist is too high and they're way too narrow, almost like tights. How are you supposed to get a pair of boots on under those? \u201cOh, 7 For All Mankind,\u201d says Nicole, raising her eyebrows. \u201cVery nice.\u201d Seven for what? \u201cI'd love a pair of those.\u201d She strokes a leg admiringly. \u201cAbout two hundred quid a pop, aren't they?\u201d Two hundred pounds? For jeans? \u201cAnd here's your jewelry,\u201d adds the other nurse, holding out a transparent plastic bag. \u201cIt had to come off for the scans.\u201d 42 Still stunned by the jeans, I take the bag. I've never been a jewelry-?type person, unless you count TopShop earrings and a Swatch. Feeling like a kid with a Christmas stocking, I reach into the bag and pull out a tangle of gold. There's an expensive-?looking bracelet made of hammered gold, and a matching necklace, plus a watch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWow. This is nice.\u201d I run my fingers cautiously over the bracelet, then reach in again and retrieve two chandelier earrings. Caught up among the knotted strands of gold is a ring, and after a bit of careful unweaving I manage to untangle it.</p><p>There's a general intake of breath. Someone whispers, \u201cOh my God.\u201d I'm holding a huge, shiny, diamond solitaire ring. The type you get in movies. The type you see on navy-?blue velvet in jewelers' windows with no price tag. At last I tear my gaze away and see that both nurses are riveted too. \u201cHey!\u201d Nicole suddenly exclaims. \u201cThere's something else. Hold out your hand, Lexi \u201d She tips up the bag and taps the corner. There's a moment's stillnessthen out onto my palm falls a plain gold band. There's a kind of rushing in my ears as I stare down at it. \u201cYou must be married!\u201d Nicole says brightly. No. No way. Surely I'd know if I was married? Surely I'd sense it deep down, amnesia or no amnesia. I turn the ring over in my clumsy fingers, feeling hot and cold all over. \u201cShe is.\u201d The second nurse nods. \u201cYou are. Don't you remember, love?\u201d I shake my head dumbly. \u201cYou don't remember your wedding?\u201d Nicole looks agog. \u201cYou don't remember anything about your husband?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d I look up suddenly with horror. \u201cI didn't marry Loser Dave, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know!\u201d Nicole gives a giggle and claps her hand over her mouth. \u201cI'm sorry. You just looked so appalled. D'you know what his name is?\u201d She looks at the other nurse, who shakes her head. \u201cSorry. I've been on the other ward. But I know there's a husband.\u201d \u201cLook, the ring's engraved!\u201d Nicole exclaims, taking it from me. \u201c 'A.S. and E.G. June 3,2005.' Coming up on their two-?year anniversary.\u201d She hands it back. \u201cIs that you?\u201d I'm breathing fast. It's true. It's carved here in solid gold. \u201cI'm A.S.,\u201d I say at last. \u201cA for Alexia. But I have no idea who E.G. is.\u201d</p><p>The E from my phone, I suddenly realize. That must have been him texting me. My husband. \u201cI think I need some cold water....\u201d Feeling giddy, I totter into the bathroom, splash water on my face, then lean forward across the cold enamel basin and stare at my bashed-?up, familiar-?unfamiliar reflection. I feel like I'm about to have a meltdown. Is someone still playing a gigantic prank on me? Am I hallucinating? I'm twenty-?eight, I have perfect white teeth, a Louis Vuitton bag, a card saying \u201cdirector,\u201d and a husband. How the hell did all that happen?</p> <p>Chapter 4</p><p>Edward. Ethan. Errol. It's an hour later and I'm still in a state of shock.</p><p>I keep looking in disbelief at my wedding ring resting on the bedside cabinet. I, Lexi Smart, have a husband. I don't feel old enough to have a husband. Elliott. Eamonn. Egbert. Please, God, not Egbert. I've ransacked the Louis Vuitton bag. I've looked all the way through the diary. I've skimmed through all my stored mobile numbers. But I still haven't found out what E stands for. You'd think I'd remember my own husband's name. You'd think it would be engraved in my psyche. When the door opens, I stiffen, almost expecting it to be him. But it's Mum again, looking pink and harassed. \u201cThose traffic wardens have no hearts. I was only twenty minutes at the vet, and\u201d \u201cMum, I've got amnesia.\u201d I cut her off in a rush.</p><p>\u201cI've lost my memory. I've lost a whole chunk of my life. I'm really... freaked out.\u201d \u201cOh. Yes, the nurse mentioned it.\u201d Her gaze briefly meets mine, then flicks away again. Mum's not the greatest at eye contact; she never has been. I used to get quite frustrated by it when I was younger, but now I just see it as one of those Mum things. Like the way she won't learn the names of TV programs properly, even after you've told her five hundred times it's not The Simpsons Family. Now she's sitting down and peeling off her waistcoat. \u201cI know exactly how you feel,\u201d she begins. \u201cMy memory gets worse every day. In fact, the other day\u201d \u201cMum...\u201d I inhale deeply, trying to stay calm. \u201cYou don't know how I feel. This isn't like forgetting where you put something. I've lost three years of my life! I don't know anything about myself in 2 0 0 7 . I don't look the same, none of my things are the same, and I found these rings which apparently belong to me, and I just have to know something...\u201d My voice is jumping about with apprehension. \u201cMum... am I really married?\u201d \u201cOf course you're married!\u201d Mum appears surprised that I need to ask. \u201cEric will be here any minute. I told you that earlier.\u201c \u201dEric's my husband?\u201c I stare at her. \u201dI thought Eric was a dog.\u201c \u201dA dog?\u201c Mum raises her eyebrows. \u201dGoodness, darling! You did get a bump on the head!\u201c Eric. I'm rolling the name around my head experimentally. My husband, Eric. It means nothing to me. It's not a name I feel either way about. 7 love you, Eric. With my body I thee worship, Eric. 46 I wait for some sort of reaction in my body. Surely I should respond? Surely all my love cells should be waking up? But I feel totally blank and nothing-?y. \u201dHe had a very important meeting this morning. But otherwise he's been here with you night and day.\u201c \u201dRight.\u201c I digest this. \u201dSo... so what's he like?\u201c \u201dHe's very nice,\u201c says Mum, as though she's talking about a sponge cake. \u201dIs h e . . . \u201d I stop. I can't ask if he's good-?looking. That would be really shallow. And what if she avoids the question and says he has a wonderful sense of humor? What if he's obese? Oh God. What if I got to know his beautiful inner soul as we exchanged messages over the Internet, only now I've forgotten all about that and I'll have to pretend his looks don't matter to me? We lapse into silence and I find myself eyeing up Mum's dressLaura Ashley, circa 1975. Frills come in and out of fashion, but somehow she doesn't notice. She still wears the same clothes she wore when she first met my dad, and the same long flicky hair, the same frosted lipstick. It's like she thinks she's still in her twenties. Not that I would ever mention this to her. We've never been into cozy mother-?daughter chats. I once tried to confide in her, when I split up with my first boyfriend. Big mistake. She didn't sympathize, or hug me, or even really listen. Instead she got all pink and defensive and sharp with me, as if I was deliberately trying to wound her by talking about relationships. I felt like I was negotiating a land-?mine site, treading on sensitive bits of her life I didn't even realize existed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So I gave up and called Fi instead. 47 \u201cDid you manage to order those sofa covers for me, Lexi?\u201d Mum interrupts my thoughts. \u201cOff the Internet,\u201d she adds at my blank look. \u201cYou were going to do it last week.\u201d Did she listen to anything I said? \u201cMum, I don't know,\u201d I say, slowly and clearly. \u201cI don't remember anything about the last three years.\u201d \u201cSorry, darling.\u201d Mum hits her head. \u201cI'm being stupid.\u201d \u201cI don't know what I was doing last week, or last year... or even who my own husband is.\u201d I spread my arms. \u201cTo be honest, it's pretty scary.\u201d \u201cOf course. Absolutely.\u201d Mum is nodding, a distant look in her eyes, as though she's processing my words. \u201cThe thing is, darling, I don't remember the name of the Web site. So if you did happen to recall\u201d \u201cI'll let you know, okay?\u201d I can't help snapping. \u201cIf my memory returns, the first thing I'll do is call you about your sofa covers. Jesus!\u201d \u201cThere's no need to raise your voice, Lexi!\u201d she says, opening her eyes wide. Okay. So in 2007 Mum still officially drives me up the wall. Surely I'm supposed to have grown out of being irritated by my mother? Automatically I start picking at my thumbnail. Then I stop. Twenty-?eight-?year-?old Lexi doesn't shred her nails. \u201cSo, what does he do?\u201d I return to the subject of my socalled husband. I still can't really believe he's real. \u201cWho, Eric?\u201d \u201cYes! Of course Eric!\u201d \u201cHe sells property,\u201d Mum says, as though I ought to know. \u201cHe's rather good at it, actually.\u201d I've married a real-?estate agent called Eric. How? 48 Why?</p><p>\u201cDo we live in my flat?\u201d \u201cYour flat?\u201d Mum looks bemused. \u201cDarling, you sold your flat a long time ago. You have a marital home now!\u201d \u201cI sold it?\u201d I feel a pang. \u201cBut I've only just bought it!\u201d I love my flat. It's in Balham and is tiny but cozy, with bluepainted window frames which I did myself, and a lovely squashy velvet sofa, and piles of colorful cushions everywhere, and fairy lights around the mirror. Fi and Carolyn helped me move in two months ago, and we spray-?painted the bathroom silver, and then spray-?painted our jeans silver too. And now it's all gone. I live in a marital home. With my marital husband. For the millionth time I look at the wedding ring and diamond solitaire. Then I automatically shoot a glance at Mum's hand. She still wears Dad's ring, despite the way he's behaved toward her over the years Dad. Dad's funeral. It's like a hand has gripped hold of my stomach, tight. \u201cMum...\u201d I venture cautiously. \u201cI'm really sorry I missed Dad's funeral. Did i t . . . you know, go all right?\u201d \u201cYou didn't miss it, darling.\u201d She peers at me as though I'm crazy. \u201cYou were there.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d I stare at her, confused. \u201cRight. Of course. I just don't remember anything about it.\u201d Heaving a massive sigh, I lean back on my pillows. I don't remember my own wedding and I don't remember my dad's funeral. Two of the most important events in my life, and I feel like I've missed out on them. \u201cSo, how was it?\u201d \u201cOh, it all went off as well as these things ever d o . . .\u201d Mum's looking twitchy, the way she always is when the subject of Dad comes up. \u201cWere many people there?\u201d</p><p>A pained expression comes to her face. \u201cLet's not dwell on it, darling. It was years ago.\u201d She gets up as though to remove herself from my questioning. \u201cNow, have you had any lunch? I didn't have time to eat anything, just a snatch of a boiled egg and toast. I'll go and find something for us both. And make sure you eat properly Lexi,\u201c she adds. \u201dNone of this no-?carbs obsession. A potato won't kill you.\u201d No carbs? Is that how I got this shape? I glance down at my unfamiliar toned legs. It has to be said, they look as if they don't know what a potato is.</p><p>\u201cI've changed in appearance quite a lot, haven't I?\u201d I can't help saying, a bit self-?consciously. \u201cMy hair... my teeth...\u201d \u201cI suppose you are different.\u201d She peers at me vaguely. \u201cIt's been so gradual, I haven't really noticed.\u201d For God's sake. How can you not even notice when your daughter turns from a manky, overweight Snaggletooth into a thin, tanned, groomed person? \u201cI won't be long.\u201d Mum picks up her embroidered shoulder bag. \u201cAnd Amy should be here any moment.\u201d \u201cAmy's here?\u201d My spirits lift as I visualize my little sister in her pink fleecy vest and flower-?embroidered jeans and those cute sneakers that light up when she dances. \u201cShe was just buying some chocolate downstairs.\u201d Mum opens the door. \u201cShe loves those mint Kit Kats.\u201d The door closes behind her and I stare at it. They've invented mint Kit Kats? 2007 really is a different world. # Amy's not my half sister or stepsister, like most people assume. She's my full, one-?hundred-?percent sister. But people 50 get confused because: 1. There's thirteen years between us. 2. My mum and dad had split up before she was born. Maybe \u201csplit up\u201d is too strong. I'm not sure what went on exactlyall I know is, my dad was never around much when I was growing up. The official reason was that his business was based abroad. The real reason was that he was a feckless chancer. I was only eight when I heard him described like that by one of my aunts at a Christmas party. \"When they saw me they got flustered and changed the subject, so I figured feckless was some really terrible swear word. It's always stuck in my mind. Feckless. The first time he left home, I was seven. Mum said he'd gone on a business trip to America, so when Melissa at school said she'd seen him in the co-?op with a woman in red jeans, I told her she was a fat liar. He came back home a few weeks later, looking tiredfrom the jet lag, he said. When I pestered him for a souvenir, he produced a pack of Wrigley's gum. I called it my American gum and showed everyone at schooluntil Melissa pointed out the co-?op price sticker. I never told Dad I knew the truth, or Mum. I'd kind of known all along that he wasn't in America. A couple of years later he disappeared again, for a few months this time. Then he started up a property business in Spain, which went bust. Then he got involved in some dodgy pyramid scheme and tried to get all our friends involved. Somewhere along the line he became an alcoholic... then he moved in for a bit with some Spanish woman But Mum kept taking him back. Then, at last, about three years ago, he moved to Portugal for good, apparently to get away from the tax man. Mum had various other \u201cgentlemen friends\u201d over the years, but she and Dad never divorcednever really let go of each other at all. And, evidently, on one of his jovial, the 51 drinks-?are-?on-?me-?darlings Christmas visits, she and he must have... Well. I don't exactly want to picture it. We got Amy, that's the point. And she's the most adorable little thing, always playing on her disco dance mat and wanting to plait my hair a million times over. The room is quiet and dim since Mum left. I pour myself a glass of water and sip it slowly. My thoughts are all cloudy, like a bomb site after the blast. I feel like a forensics expert, picking through the different strands, trying to work out the full picture. There's a faint knocking at the door and I look up. \u201cHello? Come in!\u201d \u201cHi, Lexi?\u201d An unfamiliar girl of about fifteen has edged into the room. She's tall and skinny, with jeans falling off her midriff, a pierced navel, spiky blue-?streaked hair, and about six coats of mascara. I have no idea who she is. As she sees me, she grimaces.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour face still looks fucked up.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d I say, taken aback. The girl's eyes narrow as she surveys me. \u201cLexi... it's me. You do know it's me, don't you?\u201d \u201cRight!\u201d I make an apologetic face. \u201cLook, I'm really sorry, but I've had this accident and I'm having some problems with my memory. I mean, I'm sure we have met\u201d \u201cLexi?\u201d She sounds incredulous; almost hurt. \u201cIt's me! It's Amy.\u201d I'm speechless. I'm beyond speechless. This cannot be my baby sister. But it is. Amy's turned into a tall, sassy teenager. 52 Practically an adult. As she saunters around the room, picking things up and putting them down, I'm mesmerized by the height of her. The confidence of her. \u201cIs there any food here? I'm starving.\u201d She has the same sweet, husky voice she always didbut modulated. Cooler and more street-?wise. \u201cMum's getting me some lunch. You can share if you like.\u201d \u201cGreat.\u201d She sits down in a chair and swings her long legs over the arm, displaying gray suede ankle boots with spiky heels. \u201cSo, you don't remember anything? That's so cool.\u201d \u201cIt's not cool,\u201d I retort. \u201cIt's horrible. I remember up to just before Dad's funeral... and then it just goes fuzzy. I don't remember my first few days in hospital, either. It's like I woke up for the first time last night.\u201d \u201cWay out.\u201d Her eyes are wide. \u201cSo, you don't remember me visiting you before?\u201d \u201cNo. All I remember is you being twelve. With your ponytail and braces. And those cute hair clips you used to wear.\u201d \u201cDon't remind me.\u201d Amy mimes puking, then frowns in thought. \u201cSo... let me get this straight. The whole of the last three years is a total blank.\u201d \u201cLike a big black hole. And even before that it's a bit foggy. Apparently I'm married.?\u201d I laugh nervously. \u201cI had no idea! Were you a bridesmaid at the wedding or anything?\u201c \u201dYeah,\u201c she says distractedly. \u201dIt was cool. Hey, Lexi, I don't want to bring this up when you're feeling so ill and everything, but...\u201d She twists a strand of hair, looking awkward.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I look at her in surprise. \u201cTell me.\u201d 53 \u201cWell, it's just that you owe me seventy quid.\u201d She shrugs apologetically. \u201cYou borrowed it last week when your cash card wasn't working and you said you'd pay me back. I don't suppose you'll remember...\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d I say, taken aback. \u201cOf course. Just help yourself.\u201d I gesture at the Louis Vuitton bag. \u201cI don't know if there's any cash in there...\u201d \u201cThere will be,\u201d Amy says, swiftly unzipping it with a tiny smile. \u201cThanks!\u201d She pockets the notes and swings her legs over the arm of the chair again, playing with her collection of silver bangles. Then she looks up, suddenly alert. \u201cWait a minute. Do you know about\u201d She stops herself. \u201cWhat?\u201d She surveys me with narrowed, disbelieving eyes. \u201cNo one's told you, have they?\u201d \u201cTold me what?\u201d \u201cJesus. I suppose they're trying to break things to you gradually, but, I mean...\u201d She shakes her head, nibbling her nails. \u201cPersonally, I think you should know sooner rather than later.\u201d \u201cKnow what?\u201d I feel a beat of alarm. \u201cWhat, Amy? Tell me!\u201d For a moment Amy seems to debate with herself, then she gets up. \u201cWait here.\u201d She disappears for a few moments. Then the door opens again and she reappears, clutching an Asian-?looking baby about a year old. He's wearing overalls and holding a beaker of juice, and he gives me a sunny smile. \u201cThis is Lennon,\u201d she says, her expression softening. \u201cThis is your son.\u201d I stare at them both, frozen in terror. What's she talking about?</p><p>\u201cI guess you don't remember?\u201d Amy strokes his hair fondly. \u201cYou adopted him from Vietnam six months ago. It was quite a story, actually. You had to smuggle him out in your rucksack. You nearly got arrested!\u201d I adopted a baby? I feel cold to my guts. I can't be a mum. I'm not ready. I don't know anything about babies. \u201cSay hello to your child!\u201d She carts him over to the bed, clicking in her spiky heels. \u201cHe calls you Moo-?mah, by the way.\u201d Moo-?mah? \u201cHi, Lennon,\u201d I say at last, my voice stiff with selfconsciousness. \u201cIt's...it's Moo-?mah!\u201d I try to adopt a motherly, cooing voice. \u201cCome to Moo-?mah!\u201d I look up to see Amy's lips trembling strangely. Suddenly she gives a snort of laughter and claps a hand over her mouth. \u201cSorry!\u201d \u201cAmy, what's going on?\u201d I stare at her, suspicion dawning. \u201cIs this really my baby?\u201d \u201cI saw him in the corridor before,\u201d she splutters. \u201cI couldn't resist it. Your face!\u201d She's in paroxysms of laughter. \u201c 'Come to Moo-?mah!'\u201d I can hear muffled cries and shouts coming from outside the door. \u201cThat must be his parents!\u201d I hiss in consternation. \u201cYou bloody little... Put him back!\u201d I collapse on my pillows in relief, my heart pounding. Thank fuck. I don't have a child. And I cannot get over Amy. She used to be so sweet and innocent. She used to watch Barbie Sleeping Beauty over and over with her thumb in her mouth. What's happened to her? 55 \u201cI nearly had a heart attack,\u201d I say reproachfully as she comes back in, holding a can of diet Coke. \u201cIf I died, it would be your fault.\u201d \u201cWell, you need to get savvy,\u201d she retorts with an unrepentant grin. \u201cPeople could feed you all kinds of bullshit.\u201d She takes out a stick of chewing gum and starts unwrapping it. Then she leans forward. \u201cHey, Lexi,\u201d she says in a low voice. \u201cHave you really got amnesia or are you just making it up? I won't tell.\u201d \u201c What? Why would I make it up?\u201d \u201cI thought there might be something you wanted to get out of. Like a dentist's appointment.\u201d \u201cNo! This is genuine!\u201d \u201cOkay. Whatever.\u201d She shrugs and offers me the gum. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d I wrap my arms around my knees, suddenly daunted. Amy's right. People could take total advantage of me. I have so much to learn and I don't even know where to start. Well, I could start with the obvious. \u201cSo.\u201d I try to sound casual. \u201cWhat's my husband like? What does h e . . . look like?\u201d \u201cWow.\u201d Amy's eyes open wide. \u201cOf course! You have no idea what he's like!\u201d \u201cMum said he was nice...\u201d I try to hide my apprehension. \u201cHe is lovely.\u201d She nods seriously. \u201cHe has a real sense of humor. And they're going to operate on his hump.\u201d \u201cYeah. Nice try, Amy.\u201d I roll my eyes. \u201cLexi! He'd be really hurt if he heard that!\u201d Amy looks taken aback. \u201cThis is 2007. We don't discriminate because of looks. And Eric is such a sweet, loving guy. It's not his 56 fault his back was damaged when he was a baby. And he's achieved so much. He's awe-?inspiring.\u201d Now I'm hot with shame. Maybe my husband does have a hump. I shouldn't be hump-?ist. Whatever he looks like, I'm sure I chose him for a very good reason. \u201cCan he walk?\u201d I ask nervously. \u201cHe walked for the first time at your wedding,\u201d says Amy, her eyes distant with memory. \u201cHe got up out of his wheelchair to say his vows. Everyone was in tears... the vicar could hardly speak \u201d Her mouth is twitching again. \u201cYou little cow!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cHe doesn't bloody well have a hump, does he?\u201d \u201cI'm sorry.\u201d She starts giggling helplessly. \u201cBut this is such a good game.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt's not a game!\u201d I clutch at my hair, forgetting my injuries, and wince. \u201cIt's my life.

And his name was Eric\u201c \u201dShut up! If you won't tell me, I'll ask Mum.\u201c \u201dAll right!\u201c She lifts her hands in surrender. \u201dYou seriously want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d \u201cOkay, then. You met him on a TV show.\u201d \u201cTry again.\u201d I lift my eyes to heaven. \u201cIt's true! I'm not bullshitting now. You were on that reality show Ambition. Where people want to get to the top in business. He was one of the judges and you were a contestant. You didn't get very far on the show, but you met Eric, and you hit it off.\u201d</p><p>There's silence. I'm waiting for her to crack up laughing and produce some punch line, but she just swigs from the can of diet Coke. \u201cI was on a reality show?\u201d I say skeptically. \u201cYeah. It was really cool. All my friends watched, and we all voted for you. You should have won!\u201d I eye her closely, but her face is totally serious. Is she telling the truth? Was I really on the telly? \u201cWhy on earth did I go on a show like that?\u201d \u201cTo be the boss?\u201d Amy shrugs. \u201cTo get ahead. That's when you had your teeth and hair done, to look good on TV.\u201d \u201cBut I'm not ambitious. I mean, I'm not that ambitious . . .\u201d . \u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Amy opens her eyes wide. \u201cYou're, like, the most ambitious person in the world! As soon as your boss resigned you went for his job. All the bigwigs at your company had seen you on telly and they were really impressed. So they gave it to you.\u201d My mind flashes back to those business cards in my diary. Lexi Smart, Director. \u201cYou're the youngest director they've ever had in the company. It was so cool when you got the job,\u201c Amy adds. \u201dWe all went out to celebrate, and you bought us all champagne . . .\u201c She pulls her chewing gum out of her mouth in a long strand. \u201dYou don't remember any of this?\u201c \u201dNo! Nothing!\u201c The door opens and Mum appears, holding a tray bearing a covered plate, a pot of chocolate mousse, and a glass of water. \u201dHere we are,\u201c she says. \u201dI've brought you some lasagne. And guess what? Eric's here!\u201c 58 \u201dHere?\u201c The blood drains from my face. \u201dD'you mean... here in the hospital?\u201c Mum nods. \u201dHe's on his way up right now to see you! I told him to give you a few moments to get ready.\u201c A few moments? I need more than a few moments. This is all happening way too fast. I'm not even ready to be twenty-?eight yet. Let alone meet some husband I allegedly have. \u201dMum, I'm not sure I can do this,\u201c I say, panicked. \u201dI mean... I don't feel up to meeting him yet. Maybe I should see him tomorrow. When I'm a bit more adjusted.\u201c \u201dLexi, darling!\u201c remonstrates Mum. \u201dYou can't turn your husband away. He's rushed here from his business especially to see you!\u201c \u201dBut I don't know him! I won't know what to say or what to d o . . .\u201c \u201dDarling, he's your husband.\u201c She pats my hand reassuringly. \u201dThere's nothing to worry about.\u201c \u201dHe might trigger your memory,\u201c chimes in Amy, who has helped herself to the chocolate mousse pot and is ripping the top off. \u201dYou might see him and go 'Eric! My love! It all comes back to me!'\u201c \u201dShut up,\u201c I snap. \u201dAnd that's my chocolate mousse.\u201c \u201dYou don't eat carbs,\u201c she retorts. \u201dHave you forgotten that too?\u201c She waves the spoon tantalizingly in front of my face. \u201dNice try, Amy,\u201c I say, rolling my eyes. \u201dThere's no way I would ever have given up chocolate.\u201c \u201dYou never eat chocolate anymore. Does she, Mum? You didn't eat any of your own wedding cake because of the calories!\u201d She has to be bullshitting me. I wouldn't have given up chocolate, not in a million years. I'm about to tell her to piss off and hand over the mousse, when there's a knock at the door and a muffled male voice calls, \u201cHello?\u201d \u201cOh my God.\u201d I look wildly from face to face. \u201cOh my God. Is that him? Already?\u201d \u201cHold on a moment, Eric!\u201d Mum calls through the door, then she whispers to me. \u201cTidy yourself up a bit, sweetheart! You look like you've been dragged through a hedge.\u201d \u201cGive her a break, Mum,\u201d says Amy. \u201cShe was dragged through the wreckage of a car, remember?\u201d \u201cI'll just comb your hair quickly...\u201d Mum comes over with a tiny handbag comb and starts jerking at my head. \u201cOw!\u201d I protest. \u201cYou'll make my amnesia worse!\u201d \u201cThere.\u201d She gives a final tug, and wipes at my face with the corner of a hanky. \u201cReady?\u201d \u201cShall I open the door?\u201d says Amy. \u201cNo! Just... wait a sec.\u201d My stomach is churning in dread. I can't meet some total stranger who's apparently my husband. It's just...too freaky. \u201cMum, please.\u201d I turn to her. \u201cIt's too soon. Tell him to come back later. Tomorrow. Or we could leave it a few weeks, even.\u201d \u201cDon't be silly, darling!\u201d Mum laughs. How can she laugh? \u201cHe's your husband. And you've just been in a car accident and he's been worried sick, and we've kept him waiting long enough, poor chap!\u201d As Mum heads toward the door I'm gripping the sheets so hard, the blood is squashed out of my fingertips. \u201cWhat if I hate him? What if there's no chemistry between us?\u201d My voice shoots out in terror. \u201cI mean, does he expect me to go back and live with him?\u201d \u201cJust play it by ear,\u201d Mum says vaguely. \u201cReally, Lexi, there's nothing to worry about. He's very nice.\u201d 60 \u201cAs long as you don't mention his toupee,\u201d puts in Amy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOr his Nazi past.\u201d \u201cAmy!\u201d Mum clicks her tongue in reproof and opens the door. \u201cEric! I'm so sorry to keep you. Come in.\u201d There's an unbearably long pause. Then into the room, carrying an enormous bouquet of flowers, walks the most drop-?dead gorgeous man I've ever seen.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>I can't speak. All I can do is gaze up at him, a bubble of disbelief rising inside me. This man is seriously, achingly good-?looking. Like, Armani model goodlooking. He has medium-?brown curly hair, cropped short. He has blue eyes, broad shoulders, and an expensive-?looking suit. He has a square jaw, impeccably shaved. How did I land this guy? How? How? How? \u201cHi,\u201d he says, and his voice is all deep and rounded like an actor's.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I manage breathlessly. Look at his huge chest. He must work out every day. And look at his polished shoes, and his designer watch... My eyes drift back to his hair. I never thought I'd marry someone with curly hair. Funny, that. Not that I have anything against curly hair. I mean, on him it looks fabulous. \u201cMy darling.\u201d He strides to the bed in a rustle of 62 expensive flowers. \u201cYou look so much better than yesterday.\u201d \u201cI feel fine. Um... thanks very much.\u201d I take the bouquet from him. It's the most amazing, trendy designer-?looking bouquet I've ever seen, all shades of white and taupe. Where on earth do you get taupe roses? \u201cSo...you're Eric?\u201d I add, just to be one hundred percent sure. I can see the shock reverberate through his face, but he manages a smile. \u201cYes. That's right. I'm Eric. You still don't know me?\u201d \u201cNot really. In fact... not at all.\u201d \u201cI told you,\u201d Mum chips in, shaking her head. \u201cI'm so sorry, Eric. But I'm sure she'll remember soon, if she makes a real effort.\u201d \u201cWhat's that supposed to mean?\u201d I shoot her an affronted look. \u201cWell, darling,\u201d she says, \u201cthese things are all a matter of willpower, I've read. Mind over matter.\u201d \u201cI'm trying to remember, okay?\u201d I say indignantly. \u201cYou think I want to be like this?\u201d \u201cWe'll take it slowly,\u201d Eric says, ignoring Mum. He sits down on the bed. \u201cLet's see if we can trigger some memories. May I?\u201d He gestures toward my hand. \u201cUm... yes. Okay.\u201d I nod, and he takes my hand in his. It's a nice hand, warm and firm. But it's a stranger's hand. \u201cLexi, it's me,\u201d he says in firm, resonant tones. \u201cIt's Eric. Your husband. We've been married for nearly two years.\u201d I'm too mesmerized to reply. He's even better-?looking up close. His skin is really smooth and tan, and his teeth are a perfect gleaming white...</p> <p>Oh my GodI've had sex with this man shoots through my mind.</p><p>He's seen me naked. He's ripped my underwear off. We've done who-?knows-?what together and I don't even know him. At least... I assume he's ripped my underwear off and we've done who-?knows-?what. I can't exactly ask, with Mum in the room. I wonder what he's like in bed. Surreptitiously I run my eyes over his body. Well, I married him. He must be pretty good, surely.... \u201cIs something on your mind?\u201d Eric has noticed my wandering gaze. \u201cDarling, if you have any questions, just ask away....\u201d \u201cNothing!\u201d I flush. \u201cNothing. Sorry. Carry on.\u201d \u201cWe met nearly three years ago,\u201d Eric continues, \u201cat a reception at Pyramid TV. They make Ambition, the reality show we were both involved in. We were attracted instantly. We were married in June and honeymooned in Paris. We had a suite at the George V. It was wonderful. We went to Montmartre, we visited the Louvre, we had cafe au kit every morning \u201d He breaks off. \u201cDo you recall any of this?\u201d \u201cNot really,\u201d I say, feeling guilty. \u201cSorry.\u201d Maybe Mum's right. I should try harder to remember. Come on. Paris. The Mona Lisa. Men with stripy shirts. Think. I cast my mind back, desperately trying to match his face with images of Paris, to trigger some memory.... \u201cDid we go up the Eiffel Tower?\u201d I say at last. \u201cYes!\u201d His face lights up. \u201cAre you starting to remember? We stood in the breeze and took photos of each other\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d I cut him off. \u201cI just guessed. You know, Paris... Eiffel Tower... it seemed quite likely.\u201d \u201cAh.\u201d He nods with obvious disappointment, and we lapse into silence. To my slight relief, there's a knock at the door and I call out, \u201cCome in!\u201d 64 Nicole enters, holding a clipboard. \u201cJust need to do a quick blood pressure check\u201d She breaks off as she sees Eric holding my hand. \u201cOh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't worry!\u201d I say. \u201cThis is Nicole, one of the nurses who's been looking after me.\u201d I gesture around the room. \u201cThis is my mum, and sister...and my husband, who's called\u201dI meet her eyes significantly\u201cEric.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEric!\u201d Nicole's eyes light up. \u201cVery nice to meet you, Eric.\u201d \u201cIt's a pleasure.\u201d Eric nods at her. \u201cI'm eternally grateful to you for looking after my wife.\u201d</p><p>Wife. My stomach flips over at the word. I'm his wife. This is all so grown-?up. I bet we have a mortgage, too. And a burglar alarm. \u201cMy pleasure.\u201d Nicole gives him a professional smile. \u201cLexi's a great patient.\u201d She wraps the blood pressure cuff around my arm and turns to face me. \u201cI'll just pump this u p . . . .\u201d \u201cHe's gorgeous!\u201d she mouths, giving me a surreptitious thumbs-?up, and I can't help beaming back. It's true. My husband is officially gorgeous. I've never even had a date with anyone in his league before. Let alone get married to them. Let alone go and eat croissants in the George V hotel. \u201cI'd very much like to make a donation to the hospital,\u201d Eric says to Nicole, his deep, actory voice filling the room. \u201cIf you have any special appeal or fund...\u201d \u201cThat would be wonderful!\u201d exclaims Nicole. \u201cWe've got an appeal right now for a new scanner.\u201d \u201cMaybe I could run the marathon for it?\u201d he suggests. \u201cI run every year for a different cause.\u201d I'm nearly bursting with pride. None of my other boy 65 friends has ever run the marathon. Loser Dave could barely make it from the sofa to the TV. \u201cWell!\u201d says Nicole, raising her eyebrows as she lets the blood pressure cuff deflate. \u201cIt's a real pleasure to meet you, Eric. Lexi, your pressure looks fine...\u201d She writes something on my notes. \u201cIs that your lunch there?\u201d she adds, noticing the untouched tray. \u201cOh yes. I forgot all about it.\u201d \u201cYou must eat. And I'm going to ask everyone not to stay too much longer.\u201d She turns to Mum and Amy. \u201cI know you want to spend time with Lexi, but she's still fragile. She needs to take it easy.\u201c \u201dI'll do whatever it takes.\u201c Eric clasps my hand. \u201dI just want my wife well again.\u201d</p><p>Mum and Amy start to gather their thingsbut he stays put. \u201cI'd like a few moments, just the two of us,\u201d he says. \u201cIf that's okay, Lexi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say with a dart of apprehension. \u201cEr... fine!\u201d Mum and Amy both come over to hug me good-?bye, and Mum makes another quick attempt to straighten my hair. Then the door closes behind them and I'm left alone with Eric, in a still, strange silence. \u201cSo,\u201d Eric says at last. \u201cSo. This i s . . . weird.\u201d I attempt a little laugh, which immediately peters out to nothing. Eric is gazing at me, his brow furrowed. \u201cHave the doctors said whether you'll ever retrieve your memories?\u201d \u201cThey think I will. But they don't know when.\u201d Eric gets up and strides to the window, appearing lost in thought. \u201cSo it's a waiting game,\u201d he says at last. \u201cIs there anything I can do to speed the process?\u201d 66 \u201cI don't know,\u201d I say helplessly. \u201cMaybe you could tell me some more about us and our relationship?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely. Good idea.\u201d He turns, his frame silhouetted against the window. \u201cWhat do you want to know about? Ask me anything at all.\u201d \u201cWell... where do we live?\u201d \u201cWe live in Kensington in a loft-?style apartment.\u201d He proclaims the words as though they're capitalized. \u201cThat's my business. Loft-?style living.\u201d As he says the phrase loftstyle living he makes a sweeping, parallel-?hands gesture, as though he's moving bricks along a conveyor belt. Wow. We live in Kensington! I cast around for another question to ask, but it all seems so arbitrary, like I'm padding out time in an interview. \u201cWhat sort of things do we do together?\u201d I say eventually. \u201cWe eat fine food, we watch movies... We went to the ballet last week. Had dinner at The Ivy afterward.\u201c \u201dThe Ivy?\u201d I can't help gasping. I've been to dinner at The Ivy? Why can't I remember any of this? I shut my eyes tightly, trying to mentally kick-?start my brain into action. But... nothing.</p> <p>At last I open my eyes again, feeling a bit dizzy, to see Eric has noticed the rings on the cabinet. \u201cThat's your wedding ring, isn't it?\u201d He looks up, puzzled. \u201cWhy is it here?\u201d \u201cThey took it off for the scans,\u201d I explain. \u201cShall I?\u201d He picks up the ring and takes hold of my left hand. I feel a sudden prickle of alarm. \u201c I . . . u m . . . n o . . . \u201d Before I can stop myself I yank my hand away and Eric flinches. \u201cI'm sorry,\u201d I say after an awkward pause. \u201cI'm really sorry. I just... you're a stranger.\u201d \u201cOf course.\u201d Eric has turned away, still holding the ring. \u201cOf course. Stupid of me.\u201d Oh God, he looks really hurt. I shouldn't have said \u201cstranger.\u201d I should have said \u201cfriend I haven't met yet.\u201d \u201cI'm really sorry, Eric.'' I bite my lip. \u201dI do want to know you and... love you and everything. You must be a really wonderful person or I wouldn't have married you. And you look really good,\u201c I add encouragingly. \u201dI wasn't expecting anyone nearly so handsome. I mean, my last boyfriend wasn't a patch on you.\u201c I look up to see Eric staring at me. \u201dIt's strange,\u201c he says at last. \u201dYou're not yourself. The doctors warned me, but I didn't realize it would be s o . .. extreme.\u201c For a moment he looks almost overcome, then his shoulders straighten. \u201dAnyway, we'll get you right again. I know we will.\u201c He carefully puts the ring back on the cabinet, sits down on the bed, and takes my hand. \u201dAnd just so you know, Lexi... I love you.\u201c \u201dReally?\u201c I beam delightedly before I can stop myself. \u201dI mean... fab. Thanks very much!\u201c None of my boyfriends has ever said \u201dI love you\" like thati.e., properly, in the middle of the day, like a grownup and not just pissed or while having sex. I have to reciprocate. What shall I say? I love you too.

Deal?\u201d \u201cDeal.\u201d I nod. \u201cSee you later.\u201d He lets himself out quietly. I sit still in the silence for a moment. My head's starting to throb again and I'm a bit dazed. It's all too much. Amy has blue hair and Brad Pitt has a love child with Angelina Jolie and I have a gorgeous husband who just said he loves me. I'm half-?expecting to go to sleep and wake up back in 2004, hungover on Carolyn's floor, and find this was all a dream.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>But it was no dream. I wake up the next morning and it's still 2 0 0 7 . I still have shiny perfect teeth and bright chestnut hair. And I still have a big black hole in my memory. I'm just eating my third piece of toast and taking a sip of tea when the door opens and Nicole appears, wheeling a trolley laden with flowers. I gape at it, impressed by the array. There must be about twenty arrangements on there. Tied bouquets... orchids in pots... grand-?looking roses... \u201cSo... is one of these mine?\u201d I can't help asking. Nicole looks surprised. \u201cAll of them.\u201d \u201cAll of them?\u201d I splutter, almost spilling my tea. \u201cYou're a popular girl! We've run out of vases!\u201d She hands me a stack of little cards. \u201cHere are your messages.\u201d \u201cWow.\u201d I take the first card and read it. 70 Lexidarling girl. Look after yourself, get well, see you very soon, all my love. Rosalie. Rosalie? I don't know anyone called Rosalie. Bemused, I put it aside for later and read the next one. Best wishes and get well soon. Tim and Suki. I don't know Tim and Suki, either. Lexi, get well soon! You'll soon be back to three hundred reps! From all your friends at the gym. Three hundred reps? Me? Well, I guess that would account for the muscled legs. I reach for the next cardand at last, it's from people I actually know. Get well soon, Lexi. All best wishes from Fi, Debs, Carolyn, and everyone in Flooring. As I read the familiar names, I feel a warm glow inside. It's stupid, but I almost thought my friends had forgotten all about me. Nicole interrupts my thoughts. \u201cSo your husband's quite a stunner!\u201d \u201cD'you think so?\u201d I try to appear nonchalant. \u201cYeah, he is quite nice-?looking, I suppose \u201d \u201cHe's amazing! And you know, he came around the ward yesterday, thanking us all again for looking after you. Not many people do that.\u201c \u201dI've never been out with a guy like Eric in my life!\u201c I abandon all pretense at being nonchalant. \u201dTo be honest, I still can't believe he's my husband. I mean, me. And him.\u201c There's a knock on the door and Nicole calls, \u201dCome in!\u201d It opens and in come Mum and Amy, both looking hot and sweaty, lugging between them about six shopping bags stuffed with photograph albums and envelopes. \u201cGood morning!\u201d Nicole smiles as she holds the door open. \u201cLexi's feeling a lot better today, you'll be glad to hear.\u201d \u201cOh, don't tell me she's remembered everything!\u201d Mum's face drops. \u201cAfter we've carried all these pictures all this way. Do you know how heavy photograph albums are? And we couldn't find a space in the car park\u201d Nicole cuts her off. \u201cShe's still experiencing severe memory loss.\u201d \u201cThank goodness for that!\u201d Mum suddenly notices Nicole's expression. \u201cI mean... Lexi, darling, we've brought some pictures to show you. Maybe they'll trigger your memory.\u201d I eye the bag of photos, suddenly excited. These pictures will tell my missing story. They'll show me my transformation from Snaggletooth to...whoever I am now. \u201cFire away!\u201d I put down all the flower messages and sit up. \u201c Show me my life!\u201d</p> <p>I'm learning a lot from this hospital stay. And one thing I've learned is, if you have a relative with amnesia and want to trigger her memory, just show her any old pictureit doesn't matter which one. It's ten minutes later, but I 72 haven't seen a single photo yet, because Mum and Amy keep arguing about where to start. \u201cWe don't want to overwhelm her,\u201d Mum keeps saying as they both root through a bag of pictures. \u201cNow, here we are.\u201d She picks up a photo in a cardboard frame.</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d\u201c Amy grabs it from her. \u201dI've got a zit on my chin. I look gross.\u201c \u201dAmy, it's a tiny pimple. You can hardly see it.\u201c \u201dYes, you can.

Anything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Mum advances toward the bed, holding an unframed print. \u201cI'll hold it up, Lexi. Just look at the image carefully and see if it jogs anything. Ready?\u201c Mum turns the print around. It's a picture of a dog dressed up as Santa Claus. \u201dMum...\u201c I try to control my frustration. \u201dWhy are you showing me a dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling, it's Tosca!\u201d Mum appears wounded. \u201cShe would have looked very different in 2004.

Like people?\u201d \u201cHey, Lexi, do you remember this?\u201d Amy comes forward, holding up a distinctive necklace with a rose made out of jade. I squint at it, trying desperately to dredge some memory up. \u201cNo,\u201d I say at last. \u201cIt doesn't jog anything at all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCool. Can I have it, then?\u201d \u201cAmy!\u201d says Mum. She riffles through the pictures in her hand with dissatisfaction. \u201cMaybe we should just wait for Eric to come with the wedding DVD. If that doesn't trigger your memory, nothing will.\u201d The wedding DVD. My wedding. Every time I think about this, my stomach curls up with a kind of excited, nervous anticipation. I have a wedding DVD. I had a wedding! The thought is alien. I can't even imagine myself as a bride. Did I wear a pouffy dress with a train and a veil and some hideous floral headdress? I can't even bring myself to ask. \u201cSo... he seems nice,\u201d I say. \u201cEric, I mean. My husband.\u201d \u201cHe's super.\u201d Mum nods absently, still leafing through pictures of dogs. \u201cHe does a lot for charity, you know. Or the company does, I should say. But it's his own company, so it's all the same.\u201d \u201cHe has his own company?\u201d I frown, confused. \u201cI thought he was a real-?estate agent.\u201d \u201cIt's a company that sells properties, darling. Big loft developments all over London. They sold off a large part of it last year, but he still retains a controlling interest.\u201c \u201dHe made ten million quid,\u201c says Amy, who's still crouched down by the bag of photos. \u201dHe what?\u201d I stare at her.</p><p>\u201cHe's stinking rich.\u201d She looks up. \u201cOh, come on. Don't say you hadn't guessed that?\u201d \u201cAmy!\u201d says Mum. \u201cDon't be so vulgar!\u201d I can't quite speak. In fact, I'm feeling a bit faint. Ten million quid?</p><p>There's a knock at the door. \u201cLexi? May I come in?\u201d 74 Oh my God. It's him. I hastily check my reflection and spray myself with some Chanel perfume that I found in the Louis Vuitton bag.</p><p>\u201cCome in, Eric!\u201d calls Mum. The door swings openand there he is, manhandling two shopping bags, another bunch of flowers, and a gift basket full of fruit. He's wearing a striped shirt and tan trousers, a yellow cashmere sweater, and loafers with tassels. \u201cHi, darling.\u201d He puts all his stuff down on the floor, then comes over to the bed and kisses me gently on the cheek. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d \u201cMuch better, thanks.\u201d I smile up at him. \u201cBut she still doesn't know who you are,\u201d Amy puts in. \u201cYou're just some guy in a yellow sweater.\u201d Eric doesn't look remotely fazed. Maybe he's used to Amy being bolshy. \u201cWell, we're going to tackle that today.\u201d He hefts one of the bags, sounding energized. \u201cI've brought along photos, DVDs, souvenirs Let's reintroduce you to your life. Barbara, why don't you put on the wedding DVD?\u201d He hands a shiny disc to Mum. \u201cAnd to get you started, Lexi...our wedding album.\u201d He heaves an expensivelooking calfskin album onto the bed and I feel a twang of disbelief as I see the embossed words. ALEXIA AND ERIC JUNE 3, 2005 I open it and my stomach seems to drop a mile. I'm staring at a black-?and-?white photograph of me as a bride. I'm wearing a long white sheath dress; my hair's in a sleek knot;</p><p>and I'm holding a minimalist bouquet of lilies. Nothing pouffy in sight.</p> <p>Wordlessly I turn to the next page. There's Eric standing next to me, dressed in black tie. On the following page we're holding glasses of champagne and smiling at each other. We look so glossy. Like people in a magazine. This is my wedding. My actual, real live wedding. If I needed proof... this is proof. From the TV screen suddenly comes the mingled sound of people laughing and chattering. I look up and feel a fresh shock. Up there on the telly, Eric and I are posing in our wedding outfits. We're standing next to a huge white cake, holding a knife together, laughing at someone off screen. I can't take my eyes off myself. \u201cWe chose not to record the ceremony,\u201d Eric is explaining. \u201cThis is the party afterward.\u201d \u201cRight.\u201d My voice is a tad husky. I've never been sappy about weddings. But as I watch us cutting the cake, smiling for the cameras, posing again for someone who missed the shot... my nose starts to prickle. This is my wedding day, the so-?called happiest day of my life, and I don't remember a thing about it. The camera swings around, catching the faces of people I don't recognize. I spot Mum, in a navy suit, and Amy, wearing a purple strappy dress. We're in some huge, modern-?looking space with glass walls and trendy chairs and floral arrangements everywhere, and people are spilling out onto a wide terrace, champagne glasses in their hands. \u201cWhere's this place?\u201d I ask. \u201cSweetheart...\u201d Eric gives a disconcerted laugh. \u201cThis is our home.\u201d \u201cOur home? But it's massive! Look at it!\u201d \u201cIt's the penthouse.\u201d He nods. \u201cIt's a nice size.\u201d A \u201cnice size\u201d? It's like a football field. My little Balham flat would probably fit on one of those rugs. 76 \u201cAnd who's that?\u201d I point at a pretty girl in a baby-?pink strapless dress who's whispering in my ear. \u201cThat's Rosalie. Your best friend.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My best friend? I've never seen this woman before in my life. She's skinny and tanned, with huge blue eyes, a massive bracelet on her wrist, and sunglasses pushed up on her blond, California-?girl hair. She sent me flowers, I suddenly remember. Darling girl... love, Rosalie. \u201cDoes she work at Deller Carpets?\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d Eric smiles as though I've cracked a joke. \u201cThis bit is fun.\u201d He gestures toward the screen. The camera is following us as we walk out onto the terrace, and I can just hear myself laughing and saying, \u201cEric, what are you up to?\u201d Everyone is looking up for some reason. I have no idea why And then the camera focuses and I see it. Skywriting. Lexi I will love you forever. On the screen, everyone is gasping and pointing, and I see myself staring up, pointing, shading my eyes, then kissing Eric. My husband organized surprise skywriting for me on my wedding day and I can't bloody remember it? I want to weep. \u201cNow, this is us on holiday in Mauritius last year...\u201d Eric has fast-?forwarded the DVD and I stare disbelievingly at the screen. Is that girl walking along the sand me? My hair's braided and I'm tanned and thin and wearing a red string bikini. I look like the kind of girl I'd normally gaze at with envy. \u201cAnd this is us at a charity ball...\u201d Eric's fast-?forwarded and there we are again. I'm wearing a slinky blue evening dress, dancing with Eric in a grand-?looking ballroom.</p><p>\u201cEric is a very generous benefactor,\u201d Mum says, but I don't respond. I'm riveted by a handsome, dark-?haired guy standing near the dance floor. Wait a moment. Don't I . .. know him from somewhere? I do. I do. I definitely recognize him. At last! \u201cLexi?\u201d Eric has noticed my expression. \u201cIs this jolting your memory?\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d I can't help a joyful smile. \u201cI remember that guy on the left.\u201d I point at the screen. \u201cI'm not sure who he is exactly, but I know him. Really well! He's warm, and funny, and I think maybe he's a doctor... or maybe I met him in a casino\u201c \u201dLexi...\u201c Eric gently cuts me off. \u201dThat's George Clooney, the actor. He was a fellow guest at the ball.\u201c \u201dOh.\u201c I rub my nose, discomfited. \u201dOh right.\u201d</p><p>George Clooney. Of course it is. I'm a moron. I subside back onto my pillows, dispirited. When I think of all the hideous, mortifying things I can remember. Having to eat semolina at school when I was seven, and nearly vomiting. Wearing a white swimsuit when I was fifteen and getting out of the pool, and it was transparent and all the boys laughed. I remember that humiliation like it was yesterday.</p><p>But I can't remember walking along a perfect sandy beach on Mauritius. I can't remember dancing with my husband at some grand ball. Hello, brain? Do you have any priorities? \u201cI was reading up on amnesia last night,\u201d Amy says from her cross-?legged position on the floor. \u201cYou know which sense triggers memory the best? Smell. Maybe you should smell Eric.\u201d \u201cIt's true,\u201d Mum puts in unexpectedly. \u201cLike that chap 78 Proust. One whiff of a fairy cake and everything came flooding back into his mind.\u201d \u201cGo on,\u201d Amy says encouragingly. \u201cIt's worth a try, isn't it?\u201d I glance over at Eric, embarrassed. \u201cWould you mind if I . . . smelled you, Eric?\u201d \u201cNot at all! It's worth a go.\u201d He sits on the bed and freeze-?frames the DVD. \u201cShould I lift my arms up, or...\u201d \u201cUm... I guess s o . . .\u201d Solemnly Eric lifts his arms. I lean forward gingerly and sniff his armpit. I can smell soap, and aftershave, and a mild, manly kind of smell. But nothing's rushing back into my brain. Except visions of George Clooney in Ocean's Eleven. I may not mention those. \u201cAnything?\u201d Eric is frozen, rigid in his arms-?up position. \u201cNothing yet,\u201d I say after sniffing again. \u201cI mean, nothing very strong...\u201c \u201dYou should smell his crotch,\u201c says Amy. \u201dSweetheart,\u201c Mum says faintly. I can't help glancing down at Eric's crotch. The crotch I've married. It looks pretty generous, although you can never quite tell. I wonder No. Not the point right now. \u201dWhat you two should do is have sex,\u201c Amy says into the awkward silence, then snaps her gum. \u201dYou need the pungent smell of each other's bodily\u201c \u201dAmy!\u201c Mum cuts her off. \u201dDarling! That is quite enough!\u201c \u201dI'm just saying! It's nature's own amnesia cure!\u201c \u201dSo.\u201c Eric drops his arms again. \u201dNot exactly the greatest success.\u201c \u201dNo.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe Amy's right. Maybe we should have sex. I glance at Ericand I'm convinced he's thinking the same thing. \u201cNever mind. It's still early days.\u201d Eric smiles as he closes the wedding album, but I can tell he's disappointed too. \u201cWhat if I never remember?\u201d I look around the room. \u201cWhat if all those memories are lost for good and I can never get them back? Ever?\u201d As I look around at the concerned faces I suddenly feel powerless and vulnerable. It's like that time my computer crashed and I lost all my e-?mail, only a million times worse. The techy guy kept telling me I should have backed up my files. But how do you back up your own brain? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In the afternoon I see a neuropsychologist, Neil. He's a friendly guy, in jeans. I sit at a table with him, taking tests and I have to say, I'm pretty good! I remember most of twenty words in a list; I remember a short story; I draw a picture from memory.</p><p>\u201cYou're functioning extremely well, Lexi,\u201d Neil says after he fills in the last check box. \u201cYour executive skills are there, your short-?term memory is pretty good considering, you have no major cognitive problems... but you're suffering from a severe focal retrograde amnesia. It's very unusual you know.\u201c \u201dBut why?\u201c \u201dWell, it has to do with the way you hit your head.\u201c He leans forward, animated, draws an outline of a head on his pad of paper, and starts to fill in a brain. \u201dYou've had what we call an acceleration-?deceleration injury. When you hit the windshield, your brain was thrown around in your skull, and a small area of your brain was, shall we say, tweaked. It could be you've done damage to your warehouse of 80 memories... or it could be that you've done damage to your ability to retrieve memories. In that case the warehouse is intact, if you like, but you're unable to open the door.\u201c His eyes are shining, as though this is all really fabulous and I should be thrilled with myself. \u201dCan't you give me an electric shock?\u201c I say in frustration. \u201dOr hit me over the head or something?\u201c \u201dI'm afraid not.\u201c He looks amused. \u201dContrary to popular belief, hitting an amnesiac over the head is not going to bring their memory back. So don't try that at home.\u201c He pushes his chair back. \u201dLet me walk you to your room.\u201c We arrive back at my room to find Mum and Amy still watching the home DVD while Eric talks on his cell phone. Immediately he finishes his conversation and claps his phone shut. \u201dHow did you get on?\u201c \u201dWhat did you remember, darling?\u201c Mum chimes in. \u201dNothing,\u201c I admit. \u201dOnce Lexi gets back to familiar surroundings, she'll probably find her memory returns quite naturally,\u201c says Neil reassuringly. \u201dAlthough it may take time.\u201c \u201dRight.\u201c Eric nods earnestly. \u201dSo, what next?\u201c \u201dWell.\u201c Neil flips through my notes. \u201dYou're in good shape physically, Lexi. I would say you'll probably be discharged tomorrow. I'll make an appointment for you in a month's time as an outpatient. Until then, the best place for you is home.\u201c He smiles. \u201dI'm sure that's where you want to be too.\u201c \u201dYes!\u201c I say after a pause. \u201dHome. Great.\u201d Even as I'm saying the words I realize I don't know what I mean by home. Home was my Balham flat. And that's gone. \u201cWhat's your address?\u201d He takes out a pen. \u201cFor my notes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm...not sure.\u201d \u201cI'll write it down,\u201d Eric says helpfully, and takes the pen. This is crazy. I don't know where I live. I'm like some confused old lady. \u201cWell, good luck, Lexi.\u201d Neil looks at Eric and Mum. \u201cYou can help by giving Lexi as much information as possible about her life. Write things down. Take her back to places she's been. Any problems, just call me.\u201d The door closes behind Neil and there's silence, apart from the chatter of the telly. Mum and Eric are exchanging looks. If I was a conspiracy theorist I'd say they were hatching a plan. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cSweetheart, your mother and I were talking earlier about how we would\u201dhe hesitates\u201ctackle your release.\u201d Tackle my release. He sounds like I'm a dangerous, psychotic prisoner. \u201cWe're in a pretty strange situation here,\u201d he continues. \u201cObviously I would love it if you wanted to come home and resume your life again. But I appreciate that you may find it uncomfortable. After all...you don't know me.\u201d \u201cWell, no.\u201d I chew my lip. \u201cI don't.\u201d \u201cI said to Eric, you're very welcome to come and stay with me for a bit,\u201d puts in Mum. \u201cObviously it will be a little disruptive, and you'll have to share with Jake and Florian, but they're good dogs.\u201d \u201cThat room smells,\u201d says Amy. \u201cIt does not smell, Amy.\u201d Mum seems affronted. \u201cThat builder chap said it was simply a question of dry something-?or-?other.\u201d She makes a vague gesture. 82 \u201cRot,\u201d says Amy, without moving her gaze off the television. \u201cAnd it does smell.\u201d Mum is blinking hard in annoyance. Meanwhile, Eric has come over, his face showing concern. \u201cLexi, please don't think I'll be offended. I understand how tough this is for you. I'm a stranger to you, for Christ's sake.\u201d He spreads his arms. \u201cWhy on earth would you want to come home with me?\u201d I know it's my cue to answerbut I've suddenly been distracted by an image on the TV screen. It's of me and Eric on a speedboat. God knows where we are, but the sun is shining and the sea is blue. We're both wearing sunglasses and Eric is smiling at me as he drives the boat and we look totally glamorous, like something out of a James Bond movie. I can't help staring at it, mesmerized. I want this life rushes through my brain. It belongs to me. I earned it. I'm not going to let it slip through my fingers. Eric is still talking. \u201cThe last thing I want to do is get in the way of your recovery. Whatever you want to do, I will completely understand.\u201d \u201cRight. Yes.\u201d I take a sip of water, playing for time. \u201cI'll just... think about it for a few moments.\u201d Okay, let's just get my options absolutely clear here: 1. A rotting room in Kent which I have to share with two whippets. 2. A palatial loft in Kensington with Eric, my goodlooking husband who can drive a speedboat. \u201cYou know what, Eric?\u201d I say carefully, measuring out my words. \u201cI think I should come and live with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d His face lights up, but I can tell he's taken aback. \u201cYou're my husband,\u201d I say. \u201cI should be with you.\u201d \u201cBut you don't remember me,\u201d he says uncertainly. \u201cYou don't know me.\u201d \u201cI'll get to know you again!\u201d I say with growing enthusiasm. \u201cSurely the best chance I have of remembering my life is to live it. You can tell me about yourself, and me, and our marriage I can learn it all again! And that doctor said familiar circumstances would help. They'll trigger my retrieval system or whatever.\u201d I'm more and more positive about this. So I don't know anything about my husband or my life. The point is, I've married a good-?looking multimillionaire who loves me and has a huge penthouse and brought me taupe roses. I'm not going to throw it all away just because of the small detail that I can't remember him.</p><p>Everyone has to work at their marriage in some way or another. I'll just have to work at the \u201cremembering your husband\u201d part. \u201cEric, I really want to come home with you,\u201d I say as sincerely as I can. \"I'm sure we have a great, loving marriage.</p><p>We can work it out.\u201c \u201dIt would be wonderful to have you back.\u201c Eric still looks troubled. \u201dBut please don't feel any sense of obligation\u201c \u201dI'm not doing this out of obligation! I'm doing it because . . . it just feels right.\u201c \u201dWell, I think it's a very good idea,\u201c Mum puts in. \u201dThat's it, then,\u201c I say. \u201dSettled.\u201c \u201dObviously you won't want t o . . . \u201c Eric hesitates awkwardly. \u201dI mean... I'll take the guest suite.\u201c 84 \u201dI would appreciate that,\u201c I say, trying to match his formal tone. \u201dThank you, Eric.\u201c \u201dWell, if you're sure about this...\u201c His whole face has brightened. \u201dLet's do this properly, shall we?\u201c He glances questioningly at my wedding ring, still lying on the cabinet, and I follow his gaze. \u201dYes, let's!\u201c I nod, suddenly excited. He picks up both rings and self-?consciously I hold out my left hand. I watch, transfixed, as Eric slips the rings onto my finger. First the wedding band, then the enormous diamond solitaire. There's a hush in the room as I gaze down at my beringed hand. Fuck, that diamond's huge. \u201dAre you comfortable, Lexi?\u201c Eric asks. \u201dDoes that feel right?\u201c \u201dIt feels... great! Really. Just right.\u201c A huge smile licks across my face as I turn my hand this way and that. I feel like someone should throw confetti or sing the \u201dWedding March.\" Two nights ago I was being stood up in a crappy club by Loser Dave. And now... I'm married!</p><p>Chapter 7</p> <p>It has to be karma. I must have been amazingly noble in a previous existence. I must have rescued children from a burning building, or given up my life to help lepers, or invented the wheel or something. It's the only explanation I can think of for how I've landed the dream life. Here I am, zooming along the Thames Embankment, with my handsome husband, in his open-?top Mercedes. I say zooming. Actually we're going at about twenty miles an hour. Eric is being all solicitous and saying he knows how hard it must be for me to get back in a car, and if I feel traumatized to tell him straightaway. But really, I'm fine. I don't remember anything about the crash. It's like a story I've been told that happened to someone else, the kind where you tilt your head politely and say \u201cOh no, how awful\u201d but you've already stopped listening properly. 86 I keep glancing down at myself in wonder. I'm wearing a pair of cropped jeans, two sizes smaller than I used to wear. And a top by Miu Miu, which is one of those names I only used to know about from magazines. Eric brought me a bag of clothes to choose from, and they were all so posh and designer I hardly dared touch them, let alone put them on. On the backseat are all the bouquets and presents from my hospital room, including a massive basket of tropical fruit from Deller Carpets. There was a letter attached from someone called Clare, which said she would send me the minutes of the latest board meeting to read at my leisure, and she hoped I was feeling better. And then she signed it \u201cClare Abrahams, assistant to Lexi Smart.\u201d</p><p>Assistant to Lexi Smart. I have my own personal assistant. I'm on the board of directors. Me! My cuts and bruises are a lot better and the plastic staple has been taken out of my head. My hair is freshly washed and glossy and my teeth are as movie-?star perfect as ever. I can't stop smiling at every shiny surface I pass. In fact, I can't stop smiling, full stop.</p><p>Maybe in a previous life I was Joan of Arc and I got tortured horrifically to death. Or I was that guy in Titanic. Yes. I drowned in a cruel, freezing sea and never got Kate Winslet, and this is my reward. I mean, people don't just get presented with a perfect life for no good reason. It just doesn't happen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll right, darling?\u201d Eric briefly puts his hand on mine. His curly hair is all ruffled in the wind and his expensive sunglasses are glinting in the sunshine. He looks like the kind of guy the Mercedes PR people would want to be driving their cars.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I beam back. \u201cI'm great!\u201d I'm Cinderella. No, I'm better than Cinderella, because she only got the prince, didn't she? I'm Cinderella with fab teeth and a shit-?hot job. Eric signals left. \u201cWell, here we are...\u201d He pulls off the road into a grand pillared entrance, past a porter in a glass box, into a parking space, and then turns off the engine. \u201cCome and see your home.\u201d You know how some hyped-?up things are a total letdown when you actually get to them. Like, you save up for ages to go to an expensive restaurant and the waiters are snooty and the table is too small and the dessert tastes like Mr Whippy. Well, my new home is approximately the opposite of that. It's way better than I imagined. As I walk around, I'm awestruck. It's massive. It's light. It has views over the river.</p><p>There's a vast, L-?shaped cream sofa and the coolest black granite cocktail bar. The shower is a whole marble-?clad room, big enough for about five people. \u201cDo you remember any of this?\u201d Eric is watching me intently. \u201cIs it triggering anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But it's absolutely stunning!\u201d We must have some cool parties here. I can just see Fi, Carolyn, and Debs perched at the cocktail bar, tequila shooters going, music blaring over the sound system. I pause by the sofa and run my hand along the plushy fabric. It's so pristine and plumped up, I don't think I'll ever dare sit down on it. Maybe I'll just have to hover. It'll be great for my bum muscles. \u201cThis is an amazing sofa!\u201d I look up at Eric. \u201cIt must have cost a packet.\u201d He nods. \u201cTen thousand pounds.\u201d Shit. I draw my hand back. How can a sofa cost that 88 much? What's it stuffed with, caviar? I edge away, thanking God I didn't sit down on it. Memo to self: do not ever drink red wine on / eat pizza on / ever go near the ten-?grand posh cream sofa. \u201cI really love this... e r . . . light fitting.\u201d I gesture to a free-?standing undulating piece of metal. Eric smiles. \u201cThat's a radiator.\u201d \u201cOh right,\u201d I say, confused. \u201cI thought that was a radiator.\u201d I point to an old-?fashioned iron radiator that has been painted black and fitted halfway up the opposite wall. \u201cThat's a piece of art.\u201d Eric corrects me. \u201cIt's by Hector James-?John. Disintegration Falls.\u201d I walk over to it, cock my head, and gaze up alongside Eric, with what I hope is an intelligent art-?lover's expression. Disintegration Falls. Black radiator. Nope, no idea. \u201cIt's s o . . . structural,\u201d I venture after a pause. \u201cWe were lucky to get this,\u201d Eric says, nodding at the piece. \u201cWe tend to invest in a piece of nonrepresentational art about every eight months. The loft can take it. And it's about the portfolio as much as anything else.\u201d He shrugs as though this is self-?explanatory. \u201cOf course!\u201d I nod. \"I would have thought the portfolio...</p> <p>aspect would b e . . . absolutely...\" I clear my throat and turn away. Keep your mouth shut, Lexi. You know fuck-?all about modern art or portfolios or basically what it's like being rich and you're giving it all away.</p><p>I turn away from the radiator-?art-?thing and focus on a giant screen, which almost fills the opposite wall. There's a second screen across the room, by the dining table, and I noticed one in the bedroom. Eric clearly likes the telly.</p><p>He notices me looking at it. \u201cWhat would you like?\u201d He 89 picks up a remote control and flicks it at the screen. \u201cTry this.\u201d The next minute I'm looking at a massive blazing, crackling fire. \u201cWow!\u201d I stare at it in surprise.</p><p>\u201cOr this.\u201d The picture changes to brightly colored tropical fish weaving through fronds of seaweed. \u201cIt's the latest in home screen system technology,\u201d he says proudly. \u201cIt's art, it's entertainment, it's communication. You can e-?mail on these things, you can listen to music, read books... I have a thousand works of literature stored on the system. You can even have a virtual pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pet?\u201d I'm still gazing at the screen, dazzled. \u201cWe each have one.\u201d Eric smiles. \u201cThis is mine, Titan.\u201d He flicks his control and an image appears on the screen of a massive stripy spider, prowling around a glass box. \u201cOh my God!\u201d I back away, feeling sick. I've never been great with spiders, and that one is about ten feet high. You can see the hairs on its horrible legs. You can see its face. \u201cCould you possibly switch that off, please?\u201d \u201cWhat's wrong?\u201d Eric looks-?surprised. \u201cI showed Titan to you on your first visit here. You said you thought he was adorable.\u201d Great. It was our first date. I said I liked the spider to be polite, and now I'm stuck with it. \u201cYou know what?\u201d I say, trying to keep my gaze averted from Titan. \u201cThe crash could have given me a spider phobia.\u201d I try to sound knowledgeable, like I heard this from a doctor or. something. \u201cMaybe.\u201d Eric has a slight frown, as though he's about to pick holes in this theory. As well he might. \u201cSo I have a pet too?\u201d I say quickly, to distract him. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cHere you go.\u201d He zaps at the screen. \u201cHere's Arthur.\u201d 90 A fluffy white kitten appears on the screen and I cry out in delight. \u201cHe's so cute!\u201d I watch him playing with a ball of string, batting it and tumbling over. \u201cDoes he grow up into a cat?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Eric smiles. \u201cHe stays as a kitten indefinitely. All your life, if you want. They have a life capacity of one hundred thousand years.\u201d \u201cOh, right,\u201d I say after a pause. Actually, that's freakish. A one-?hundred-?thousand-?year-?old virtual kitten. Eric's phone beeps and he flips it open, then zaps at the screen again to restore the fish.\u201cSweetheart, my driver's here. I'm going to have to go to the office briefly. But Rosalie is on her way to keep you company. Until then, if anything bothers you, just call me at onceor you can e-?mail me through the system.\u201d He hands me a rectangular white gadget with a screen. \u201cHere's your remote control. It controls heating, ventilation, lighting, doors, blinds... Everything here is intelligent. But you shouldn't need to use it. All the settings are in place.\u201d \u201cWe have a remote-?control house?\u201d I want to laugh. \u201cIt's all part of loft-?style living!\u201d He makes the parallel hand gesture again, and I nod, trying not to give away how overwhelmed I am. I watch as he shrugs on his jacket. \u201cSo... how exactly does Rosalie fit in?\u201d \u201cShe's the wife of my partner, Clive. You two have a great time together.\u201d \u201cDoes she hang out with me and the other girls from the office?\u201d I ask. \u201cLike Fi and Carolyn? Do we all go out together?\u201d \u201cWho?\u201d Eric looks blank. Maybe he's one of those guys who doesn't keep up with his wife's social life. \u201cNever mind,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cI'll work it all out.\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGianna will be back later too.

Then he disengages his hand and heads toward the door, and a moment later it closes behind him. I'm alone. Alone in my marital home. As I look around the huge space again, taking in the Lucite cube coffee table, the leather chaise, the art books... I realize I can't see that many signs of me. There are no brightly colored pottery jugs or fairy lights or piles of paperbacks.</p><p>Well, Eric and I probably wanted to start again, choosing things together. And we probably got loads of amazing wedding presents. Those blue-?glass vases on the mantelpiece look like they cost a fortune.</p><p>I wander over to the huge windows and peer down at the street below. There's no noise or draft or anything. I watch a man carry a package into a taxi far below and a woman struggling with a dog on a lead. Then I pull out my phone and start texting Fi. I have to talk to her about all of this. I'll get her to come around later. We'll curl up on the sofa and she can fill me in on my life, starting with Eric. I can't help smiling with anticipation as I press the buttons. Hi! Back homegive me a call! Can't wait to c u!H Lxxxx I send the same text to Carolyn and Debs. Then I put my phone away and swivel around on the shiny wooden floor. I've been trying to keep up a nonchalant air in front 92 of Eric, but now that I'm alone I can feel a beam of elation popping through. I never thought I'd live anywhere like this, ever. A laugh suddenly bubbles to my lips. I mean, it's crazy. Me. In this place! I swivel again on the floor, then start twirling, my arms out, laughing madly. I, Lexi Smart, live here in this state-?ofthe- art remote-?controlled palace! Sorry, Lexi Gardiner. This thought makes me giggle even more. I didn't even know my own married name when I woke up. What if it had been Pratt-?Bottom? What would I have said then? \u201cSorry, Eric, you seem a lovely guy, but there's absolutely no way on earth...\u201d Crash. The sound of breaking glass interrupts my thoughts. I stop twirling in horror. Somehow I accidentally caught my hand on a glass leopard that was leaping through the air on a display shelf. Now it's lying on the floor in two pieces. I've broken a priceless ornament, and I've only been in the place about three minutes. Shit. I cautiously bend down and touch the bigger tail-?end piece. There's a nasty jagged edge and some splinters of glass on the floor. There's no way this can be mended. I'm hot with panic. What am I going to do? What if it was worth ten thousand quid, like the sofa? What if it's some family heirloom of Eric's? What was I thinking, twirling around? Gingerly I pick up the first piece, and then the second. I'll have to sweep up the splinters of glass and then An electronic beep interrupts me and my head jerks up.</p> <p>The giant screen opposite has turned bright blue with a message in green capitals. HI, LEXIHOW ARE YOU DOING? Fuck! He can see me. He's watching me. It's Big Brother! In terror I leap to my feet and shove the two pieces of glass under a cushion on the sofa. \u201cHi,\u201d I say to the blue screen, my heart pounding. \u201cI didn't mean to do that, it was an accident...\u201d There's silence. The screen isn't moving or reacting in any way. \u201cEric?\u201d I try again. There's no reply. Okay... maybe he can't see me after all. He must be typing this from the car. Cautiously I venture over to the screen and notice a wall-?mounted keyboard and tiny silver mouse, discreetly tucked away to the side. I click on Reply and slowly type FINE, THANKS! I could leave it there. I could find a way to fix the leopard ... or replace it somehow.... No. Come on. I can't start off my brand-?new marriage by keeping secrets from my husband. I have to be brave and own up. HAVE BROKEN GLASS LEOPARD BY MISTAKE, I type. REALLY SORRY. HOPE IS NOT IRREPLACEABLE? I press Send and pace about as I wait for the reply, telling myself over and over not to worry. I mean, I don't know for certain that it's a priceless ornament, do I? Maybe we won it in a raffle. Maybe it's mine, and Eric's always hated it. How am I supposed to know? How am I supposed to know anything? I sink down onto a chair, suddenly overwhelmed by how little I know about my own life. If I'd known I was going to 94 get amnesia, I would have at least written myself a note. Given myself a few tips. Be careful of the glass leopard, it's worth a bloody fortune. P.S., you like spiders. There's a beep from the screen. I catch my breath and look up. OF COURSE IS NOT IRREPLACEABLE! DON'T WORRY. I feel a huge whoosh of relief. It's all right. THANKS! I type, smiling. WON'T BREAK ANYTHING ELSE, PROMISE! I can't believe I overreacted like that. I can't believe I hid the pieces under a cushion. What am I, five years old? This is my own house. I'm a married woman. I have to start behaving like it. Still beaming to myself, I lift up the cushion to retrieve the piecesand freeze. Fuck. The bloody glass has ripped the bloody cream sofa. I must have caught it as I shoved the pieces underneath. The plushy fabric's all ragged. The ten-?thousand-?pound sofa. I automatically glance up at the screenthen quickly look away, hollow with fear. I can't tell Eric I've ruined the sofa too. I can't. Okay. What I'll do i s . . . i s . . . I won't tell him today. I'll wait for a better moment. Flustered, I rearrange the cushions so the rip isn't visible. There. Good as new. No one looks under cushions, do they? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I grab the bits of glass leopard and head into the kitchen, which is all glossy gray-?lacquer cupboards and rubber floor. I locate a roll of kitchen paper, wrap up the leopard, manage to track down the trash behind a streamlined unit door, and chuck the bits in. Okay. That's it. I am not wrecking anything else. A buzzer sounds through the apartment and I look up my spirits lifting. This must be Rosalie, my new best friend. I can't wait to meet her. Rosalie turns out to be even skinnier than she looked on the wedding DVD. She's dressed in black capri pants, a pink cashmere V neck, and huge Chanel sunglasses pushing her blond hair back. As I open the door she gives a small shriek and drops the Jo Malone gift bag she's holding. \u201cOh my God, Lexi. Look at your poor face.\u201d \u201cIt's fine!'' I say reassuringly. \u201dHonestly, you should have seen me six days ago. I had a plastic staple in my head.\u201c \u201dYou poor thing. What a nightmare.\u201c She retrieves her gift bag, then kisses me on each cheek. \u201dI would have come around earlier, only you know how long I waited to get that slot at Cheriton Spa.\u201c \u201dCome in.\u201c I gesture to the kitchen. \u201dWould you like a cup of coffee?\u201c \u201dSweetie...\u201c She looks puzzled. \u201dI don't drink coffee. Dr. Andre banned me. You know that.\u201c \u201dOh right.\u201c I pause. \u201dThe thing i s . . . I don't remember. I have amnesia.\u201c Rosalie is gazing at me, politely blank. Doesn't she know? Didn't Eric tell her? \u201dI don't remember anything about the last three years,\u201c I try again. \u201dI hit my head and it's all been wiped from my memory.\u201c \u201dOh my God.\u201c Rosalie's hand goes to her mouth. \u201dEric kept saying things about amnesia and you wouldn't know me. I thought he was joking!\u201c I want to giggle at her horrified expression. \u201dNo, he wasn't joking. To me you're... a stranger.\u201c \u201dI'm a stranger?\" She sounds hurt. 96 \u201cEric was a stranger too,\u201d I add hastily. \u201cI woke up and I didn't know who he was. I still don't, really.\u201d There's a short silence during which I can see Rosalie processing this information. Her eyes widen and her cheeks puff out and she chews her lip.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she says at last. \u201cNightmare.\u201d \u201cI don't know this place.\u201d I spread my arms around. \u201cI don't know my own home. I don't know what my life is like. If you could help me out, o r . . . tell me a few things...\u201d \u201cAbsolutely! Let's sit down...\u201d She leads the way into the kitchen area. She dumps the Jo Malone bag on the counter and sits down at the trendy steel breakfast table and I follow suit, wondering if I chose this table, or Eric chose it, or we both chose it together. I look up to see Rosalie staring at me. At once she smilesbut I can see she's freaked out. \u201cI know,\u201d I say. \u201cIt's a weird situation.\u201d \u201cSo, is it permanent?\u201d \u201cApparently my memory could come back, but no one knows if it will. Or when it will, or how much.\u201d \u201cAnd apart from that, are you okay?\u201d \u201cI'm fine, except one of my hands is a bit slow.\u201d I lift up my left hand to show her. \u201cI've got physio exercises to do.\u201d I flex my hand like the physiotherapist taught me, and Rosalie watches in fascinated horror. \u201cNightmare\u201d she breathes. \u201cBut the real problem i s . . . I don't know anything about my life since 2004. It's just a big black hole. The doctors said I should try and talk to my friends and build up a picture, and maybe that'll trigger something.\u201d \u201cOf course.\u201d Rosalie nods. \u201cLet me fill you in. What do you want to know?\u201d She leans forward expectantly.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d I think for a moment. \u201cHow did we two meet?\u201d \u201cIt was about two and a half years ago.\u201d Rosalie nods firmly. \u201cI was at a drinks party, and Eric said, 'This is Lexi.' And I said, 'Hi!' And that's how we met!\u201d She beams. \u201cRight.\u201d I shrug apologetically. \u201cI don't remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were at Trudy Swinson's? You know, who used to be an air hostess, but she met Adrian on a flight to New York, and everyone says she zeroed in on him as soon as she spotted his black Amex...\u201d She trails off, as if the enormity of the situation is hitting her for the first time. \u201cSo you don't remember any gossip?\u201d \u201cWell... no.\u201d \u201cOh my God.\u201d She blows out sharply. \u201cI have so much to fill you in on. Where shall I start? Okay, so there's me.\u201d She pulls a pen out of her bag and starts writing. \u201cAnd my husband, Clive, and his evil bitch ex, Davina. Wait till you hear about her. And there's Jenna and Petey\u201d \u201cDo we ever hang out with my other friends?\u201d I interrupt her. \u201cLike Fi and Carolyn? Or Debs? Do you know them?\u201d \u201cCarolyn. Carolyn.\u201d Rosalie taps the pen against her teeth, frowning thoughtfully. \u201cIs she that lovely French girl at the gym?\u201d \u201cNo, Carolyn my friend from work. And Fi. I must have talked about them, surely. I've been friends with Fi forever . . . we go out every Friday night...\u201d Rosalie looks blank. \u201cSweetie, to be honest, I've never heard you mention them. As far as I know, you never socialize with colleagues from work.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at her. \u201cBut...it's our thing! We go clubbing and we dress up and we have cocktails...\u201d 98 Rosalie laughs. \u201cLexi, I've never even seen you with a cocktail! You and Eric are both so serious about wine.\u201d Wine? That can't be right. All I know about wine is that it comes from Oddbins. \u201cYou look confused,\u201d Rosalie says anxiously. \u201cI'm bombarding you with too much information. Forget the gossip.\u201d She pushes aside her sheet of paper, on which I can see she's written a list of names with \u201cbitch\u201d and \u201csweetheart\u201d next to them. \u201cWhat would you like to do?\u201d \u201cMaybe we could just do whatever we normally do together?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely!\u201d Rosalie ponders for a moment, then her brow clears. \u201cWe should go to the gym.\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe gym,\u201d I echo, trying to sound enthused. \u201cOf course. So... I go to the gym a lot?\u201d \u201cSweetie, you're addicted! You run for an hour every other morning at six a.m.\u201d</p><p>Six a.m.? Running? I never run. It's painful and it makes your boobs bounce around. I once did a mile-?long fun run with Fi and Carolyn, and I nearly died. Although at least I was better than Fi, who gave up running after two minutes and walked the rest of the way, smoking a cigarette, and then got into a row with the organizers and was banned from any future Cancer Research fund-?raisers. \u201cBut don't worry, we'll do something lovely and restful today,\u201d Rosalie says reassuringly. \u201cA massage, or a nice gentle stretch class. Just grab your exercise clothes and we'll go!\u201d \u201cOkay!\u201d I hesitate. \u201cActually, this is a bit embarrassing . . . but I don't know where my clothes are. All the cupboards in our bedroom are full of Eric's suits. I can't find any of mine.\u201d</p><p>Rosalie looks utterly pole-?axed. \u201cYou don't know where your clothes are?\u201d Tears suddenly spring to her huge blue eyes and she fans her face. \u201cI'm sorry,\u201d she gulps. \u201cBut it's just come home to me how horrific and scary this must be for you. To have forgotten your entire wardrobe.\u201d She takes a deep breath, composing herself, then squeezes my hand. \u201cCome with me, sweetie. I'll show you.\u201d So the reason I couldn't find my clothes is they're not in a wardrobe, they're in a whole other room, behind a concealed door which looks like a mirror. And the reason they need a whole other room is because there's so bloody many of them. As I stare at the racks I feel faint. I've never seen so many clothes, not outside a shop. Crisp white shirts, tailored black trousers, suits in shades of mushroom and taupe. Chiffony evening wear. Tights rolled up in their own special drawer. Folded silky knickers with La Perla labels. I can't see anything that doesn't look brand-?new and immaculate. There are no baggy jeans, no sloppy sweaters, no comfy old pj's. I leaf through a row of jackets, all pretty much identical apart from the buttons. I can't believe I've spent so much money on clothes and they're all versions of beige.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Rosalie is watching me, her eyes sparkling. \u201cAmazing!\u201d \u201cAnn has a great eye.\u201d She nods sagely. \u201cAnn, your personal shopper.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have a personal shopper?\u201d \u201cJust for the main pieces each season...\u201d Rosalie pulls out a dark blue dress with spaghetti straps and the tiniest ruffle around the hem. \u201cLook, this is the dress you wore 100 when we first met. I remember thinking, 'Ah, this is the girl Eric's smitten with.' It was the talk of the party! And let me tell you, Lexi, there were a lot of disappointed girls out there when you two got married \u201d She reaches for a long black evening dress. \u201cThis is the dress you wore to my murder mystery evening.\u201d She holds it up against me. \u201cWith a little fur shrug and pearls... Don't you remember?\u201d \u201cNot really.\u201d \u201cWhat about this Catherine Walker? You must remember that... or your Roland Mouret...\u201d Rosalie is whipping out dress after dress, none of which looks remotely familiar. She reaches a pale garment carrier and stops with a gasp. \u201cYour wedding dress!\u201d Slowly, reverently, she unzips the garment carrier and pulls out the silky white sheath I recognize from the DVD. \u201cDoesn't that bring it all back?\u201d I stare at the dress, trying as hard as I can to will my memory to return... but nothing. \u201cOh my God.\u201d Rosalie suddenly claps a hand over her mouth. \u201cYou and Eric should have a renewal of vows! I'll plan it for you! We could have a Japanese theme, you could wear a kimono\u201d \u201cMaybe!\u201d I cut her off. \u201cIt's early days. I'll...think about it.\u201d \u201cHmm.\u201d Rosalie looks disappointed as she packs the wedding dress away. Then her face lights up. \u201cTry the shoes. You have to remember your shoes.\u201d</p><p>She heads to the other side of the room and flings open a cupboard door. And I stare in disbelief. I've never seen so many shoes. All in neat rows, most of them high-?heeled. What am I doing with high-?heeled shoes?</p><p>\u201cThis is unbelievable.\u201d I turn to Rosalie. \u201cI can't even walk in heels, God knows why I bought them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can.\u201d Rosalie looks puzzled. \u201cOf course you can.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI've never been able to do heels. I fall over, I twist my ankle, I look stupid...\u201d \u201cSweetie.\u201d Rosalie's eyes are wide. \u201cYou live in heels. You were wearing these last time we had lunch.\u201d She pulls out a pair of black pumps with four-?inch stiletto heels. The kind I'd never even look at in a shop. The soles are scuffed. The inside label has been rubbed away. Someone's been wearing these. Me? \u201cPut them on!\u201d says Rosalie. Cautiously I slip off my loafers and step into the pointy heels. Almost at once I topple over and grab Rosalie. \u201cYou see? I can't balance.\u201d \u201cLexi, you can walk in these,\u201d Rosalie says firmly. \u201cI've seen you do it.\u201d \u201cI can't.\u201d I make to take them off, but Rosalie grabs my arm. \u201cNo! Don't give up, sweetie. It's in you, I know it is! You have t o . . . unlock it!\u201d I try another step, but my ankle bends like plasticine. \u201cIt's no good.\u201d I exhale in frustration. \u201cI wasn't meant to do this.\u201d \u201cYes, you were. Try again! Find the zone!\u201d Rosalie sounds like she's coaching me for the Olympics. \u201cYou can do it, Lexi.\u201d I totter to the other side of the room and cling to the curtain. \u201cI'll never crack this,\u201d I say despairingly. \"Of course you will. Just don't think about it. Distract yourself. I know! We'll sing a song! 'Land of hope and gloreeee...' Come on, Lexi, singV 102 Reluctantly I join in. I really hope Eric doesn't have a CCTV camera trained on us at this moment. \u201cNow walk!\u201d Rosalie gives me a little push. \u201cGo!\u201d \u201c 'Land of hope and gloreeee....'\u201d Trying to keep my mind focused on the song, I take a step forward. Then another. Then another. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh my God. I'm doing it. I'm walking in high heels! \u201cYou see?\u201d Rosalie crows in triumph. \u201cI told you! You are a heels girl.\u201d I get to the other side of the room, swivel around confidently, and walk back, an elated grin on my face. I feel like a model! \u201cI can do it! It's easy!\u201d \u201cYay!\u201d Rosalie lifts her hand and gives me a high-?five. She opens a drawer, scoops up some gym clothes, and pops them into an oversize tote. \u201cCome on, let's go.\u201d We drive to the gym in Rosalie's car. It's a sumptuous Range Rover with the license plate ROS 1. Designer shopping bags are strewn all over the backseat. \u201cSo, what do you do?\u201d I say as she winds her way between two lanes of traffic. \u201cI do a lot of volunteer work.\u201d She nods earnestly. \u201cWow.\u201d I feel a bit shamefaced. Rosalie didn't strike me as the volunteer-?work type, which just shows how prejudiced I am. \u201cWhat kind?\u201d \u201cEvent planning, mainly.\u201d \u201cFor a particular charity?\u201d \u201cNo, mostly for friends. You know, if they need a helping hand with the flowers or party favors or whatever...\u201d Rosalie's smiling winsomely up at a truck driver. \u201cPlease let me in, Mr. Lorry-?driver... Thank you!\u201c She pulls over into the next lane and blows him a kiss. \u201dI do the odd bits for the company, too,\u201c she adds. \u201dEric's such a sweetie, he always gets me involved in launches, that kind of thing. Oh shit, road works!\u201c She swerves, to a cacophony of angry hooting, and turns the radio up higher. \u201dSo you like Eric?\u201d I try to sound casual, although I'm dying to hear what she thinks of him.</p><p>\u201cOh, he's the perfect husband. Absolutely perfect.\u201d She draws up at a crosswalk. \u201cMine's a monster.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d I stare at her. \u201cMind you, I'm a monster too.\u201d She turns to face me, her blue eyes deadly serious. \u201cWe're so volatile. It's a total lovehate relationship. Here we are!\u201d She zooms off again and drives into a tiny car park, pulls up next to a Porsche, and turns off the engine. \u201cNow, don't worry,\u201d she says as she ushers me toward the glass double doors. \u201cI know this will be really hard for you, so I'll do all the talking Hi there!\u201d She pushes her way into a smart reception area furnished with tan leather seating and a pebbled fountain.</p><p>\u201cHi, ladies.\u201d The receptionist's face falls as she sees me. \u201cLexi! You poor thing! We heard about the accident. Are you all right?\u201d \u201cI'm fine, thanks.\u201d I venture a smile. \u201cThanks very much for the flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Lexi has amnesia,\u201d says Rosalie impressively. \u201cShe doesn't remember this place. She doesn't remember anything.\u201d She casts around as though for a way to illustrate. \u201cLike, she doesn't remember this door...or...or this plant...\u201d She gestures to a large frondy fern. 104 \u201cGoodness!\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d Rosalie is nodding solemnly. \u201cIt's a nightmare for her.\u201d She turns to me. \u201cIs this bringing back any memories, Lexi?\u201d \u201cEr... not really,\u201d Everyone in the reception area is staring at me, agog. I feel like a member of the Amnesia Freak Circus. \u201cCome on!\u201d Rosalie firmly takes hold of my arm. \u201cWe'll get changed. You might remember once you're in your exercise clothes.\u201d The changing rooms are the most palatial ones I've ever seen, all smooth wood and mosaic showers and gentle music playing over the speakers. I disappear into a cubicle and pull on a pair of leggings. Then I pull on the leotard bit. It's got a thong, I realize to my horror. My bum will look massive. I can't wear this. But I don't have anything else. Reluctantly I pull it on, then edge out of the cubicle, hands over my eyes. This could be really, really gross. I count to five, then force myself to take a peek. Actually...I don't look too bad. I remove my hands completely and stare at myself. I look all long and lean and... different. Experimentally I flex my armand a biceps muscle I've never seen before pops up. I stare at it in astonishment. \u201cSo!\u201d Rosalie bustles up to me, dressed in leggings and a crop top. \u201cThis way...\u201d She ushers me into a large, airy exercise studio, where rows of well-?groomed women are already in position on yoga mats. \u201cSorry we're late,\u201d she says momentously, looking around the room. \u201cBut Lexi has got amnesia. She doesn't remember anything. About any of you.\u201d</p> <p>I get the feeling Rosalie is enjoying this. \u201cHi.\u201d I do a shy wave around the room. \u201cI heard about your accident, Lexi.\u201d The exercise teacher is coming over wearing a sympathetic smile. She's a slim woman with cropped blond hair and a headset. \u201cPlease take it easy today. Sit out whenever you like. We're starting with some mat work...\u201d \u201cOkay. Thanks.\u201d \u201cWe're trying to trigger her memory,\u201d Rosalie chimes in. \u201cSo everyone just act normal.\u201d As all the others raise their arms, I nervously take a mat and sit down. Gym has never exactly been my strong point. I guess I'll just follow as best I can. I stretch my legs out in front of me and reach for my toes, although there's no way I'll ever be able to Bloody hell. I can touch my toes. In fact, I can put my head right down on my knees. What's happened to me? In disbelief I follow the next maneuverand I can do that one too! I'm bendy! My body is moving into each position as if it can remember everything perfectly, even if I can't. \u201cAnd now, for those that are up to it,\u201d the teacher is saying \u201cthe advanced dancer position...\u201d Cautiously I start tugging on my ankleand it obeys me! I'm pulling my leg right above my head! I feel like yelling \u201cLook at me, everyone!\u201d \u201cDon't overdo it, Lexi.\u201d The teacher looks alarmed. \u201cMaybe take it easy now. I'd leave out splits this week.\u201d No way. I can do splits? Afterward in the changing room I'm exhilarated. I sit in front of the mirror, drying my hair, watching as it turns 106 from damp mouse back to shiny glowing chestnut. \u201cI can't get over it,\u201d I keep saying to Rosalie. \u201cI was always so crap at exercise!\u201d \u201cSweetie, you're a natural!\u201d Rosalie is slathering body lotion all over herself. \u201cYou're the best in the class.\u201d I switch off the hair dryer, pull my hands through my dry hair, and survey my reflection. For the millionth time, my gaze is drawn to my gleaming white teethand my full pink lips. My mouth never looked like that in 2004I know it didn't. \u201cRosalie.\u201d I lower my voice. \u201cCan I ask you a... a personal question?\u201d \u201cOf course!\u201d Rosalie whispers back. \u201cDid I ever have anything done? To my face? Like Botox? Or\u201dI lower my voice still further, hardly able to believe I'm saying this\u201csurgery?\u201d \u201cSweetie!\u201d Rosalie looks appalled. \u201cShh!\u201d She puts her finger to her lips. \u201cBut...\u201d \u201cShh! Of course we haven't had anything done! All totally, one-?hundred-?percent natural.\u201d She winks. What does that wink mean? \u201cRosalie, you have to tell me what I've had done...\u201d I trail off suddenly, distracted by my reflection in the mirror. Without noticing what I've been doing, I've been taking hairpins from the jar in front of me and putting my hair up on autopilot. In about thirty seconds, I've constructed the most perfect chignon. How the fuck did I do that? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I survey my own hands I can feel slight hysteria rising inside me.

Assassinate someone with one blow of my hand? \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Rosalie catches my gaze.</p><p>\u201cI just put my hair up.\u201d I gesture at the mirror. \u201cLook. It's incredible. I've never done that before in my life.\u201d \u201cYes, you have.\u201d She looks puzzled. \u201cYou wear it like that for work every day.\u201d \u201cBut I don't remember. It's like... it's like Superwoman's taken over my body or something. I can walk in heels, I can put my hair up, I can do splits I'm like this uberwoman! It's not me.\u201d \u201cSweetie, it is you.\u201d Rosalie squeezes my arm. \u201cYou better get used to it!\u201d We have lunch in the juice bar and chat with a couple of girls who seem to know me, and then Rosalie drives me home. As we travel up in the lift I'm suddenly exhausted. \u201cSo!\u201d Rosalie says as we enter the apartment. \u201cDo you want to have another look at your clothes? Maybe swimwear!\u201d \u201cActually, I feel pretty wiped out,\u201d I say apologetically. \u201cDo you mind if I go and have a rest?\u201d \u201cOf course not!\u201d She pats my arm. \u201cI'll wait out here for you, make sure you're okay...\u201d \u201cDon't be silly.\u201d I smile. \u201cI'll be fine until Eric comes home, really. And... thanks, Rosalie. You've been so kind.\u201d \u201cDarling girl.\u201d She gives me a hug and picks up her bag. \u201cI'll give you a call. Look after yourself!\u201d She's halfway out the door when something occurs to me. \u201cRosalie!\u201d I call. \u201cWhat should I make Eric for dinner tonight?\u201d She turns and gazes at me uncomprehendingly. I suppose it is quite a strange question, out of the blue. \u201cI just thought you might know what sort of thing he likes.\u201d I laugh awkwardly. 108 \u201cSweetie...\u201d Rosalie blinks several times. \u201cSweetie, you don't make the dinner. Gianna makes the dinner. Your housekeeper? She'll be out shopping right now, then she'll come back, make dinner, turn down your bed...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Of course!\u201d I nod hastily, trying to look like I knew that all along. But bloody hell. This really is a different life. I've never even had a cleaner before, let alone a five-?star-?hotel-?type housekeeper.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess I'll go to bed, then,\u201d I say. \u201cBye.\u201d Rosalie blows me a kiss and closes the door behind her, and I head into the bedroom, which is all cream and luxurious dark wood, with a massive suede-?upholstered bed. Eric has insisted that I take the main bedroom, which is very kind and noble of him. Mind you, the spare room is pretty sumptuous too; in fact, I think he gets his own Jacuzzi, so he can't complain. I kick off my heels, climb under the duvet, and feel myself instantly relax. This is the most comfortable bed I have ever been in, ever. I wriggle around a bit, luxuriating in the smooth sheets and perfect squashy pillows. Mmm, that's good. I'll just close my eyes and have a tiny kip... I wake to a dim light and the sound of chinking crockery. \u201cDarling?\u201d comes a voice from outside the door. \u201cAre you awake?\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d I struggle to a sitting position and rub my eyes. \u201cEr...hi.\u201d The door opens and in comes Eric, holding a tray and a shopping bag. \u201cYou've been asleep for hours. I've brought you some supper.\u201d He heads toward the bed, puts down the tray, and switches on the bedside light. \u201cIt's Thai chicken soup.\u201d \u201cI love Thai chicken soup!\u201d I say in delight. \u201cThanks!\u201d</p> <p>Eric smiles and hands me a spoon. \u201cRosalie told me you two girls went to the gym today.\u201d \u201cYes. It was great.\u201d I take a spoonful of soup and it's absolutely delicious. God, I'm ravenous. \u201cEric, you couldn't get me a piece of bread, could you?\u201d I raise my head. \u201cJust to mop this up?\u201d \u201cBread?\u201d Eric frowns, looking puzzled. \u201cDarling, we don't keep bread in the house. We're both low-?carb.\u201d Oh, right. I'd forgotten about the low-?carb thing. \u201cNo problem!\u201d I smile at him and take another mouthful of soup. I can be low-?carb. Easy. \u201cWhich brings me to my little gift,\u201d says Eric. \u201cOr in fact... two gifts. This is the first one \u201d He reaches into the shopping bag and produces a laminated ring-?bound booklet, which he hands to me with a flourish. The front cover is a color photograph of me and Eric in our wedding outfits, and the title reads: Eric and Lexi Gardiner: Marriage Manual. \u201cYou remember, the doctor suggested writing down all the details of our life together?\u201d Eric looks proud. \u201cWell, I've compiled this booklet for you. Any question you have about our marriage and life together, the answer should be in there.\u201d I turn the first page, and there's a frontispiece. Eric and Lexi A better marriage for a better world \u201cWe have a mission statement?\u201d I'm slightly stunned. \u201cI came up with it just now.\u201d Eric shrugs modestly. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d \u201cIt's great!\u201d I flip through the booklet. There are pages of print, interspersed with headings, photographs, and even 110 some hand-?drawn diagrams. I can see sections on holidays, family, laundry, weekends... \u201cI've organized the entries in alphabetical order,\u201d Eric explains. \u201cAnd indexed them. It should be fairly simple to use.\u201d I flip to the index and run my eyes down the page at random. Tomatoespp. 5, 23 Tongssee Barbecue Tonguesp. 24 Tongues? Immediately I start flipping to page twentyfour. \u201cDon't try and read it now.\u201d Eric gently closes the manual. \u201cYou need to eat and sleep.\u201d I'll look up \u201ctongues\u201d later. When he's gone. I finish the rest of the soup and lean back with a contented sigh. \u201cThank you so much, Eric. That was perfect.\u201d \u201cIt's no trouble, my darling.\u201d Eric removes the tray and puts it on the dressing table. As he does so, he notices my shoes on the floor. \u201cLexi!\u201d He flashes me a smile. \u201cShoes go in your dressing room.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say. \u201cSorry.\u201d \u201cNo problem. There's a lot to learn.\u201d He comes back over to the bed and reaches into his pocket. \u201cAnd this is my other gift...\u201d He produces a little jewelry box made of leather. My head starts prickling in disbelief as I gaze at it. My husband is giving me a present in a posh jewelry box. Just like grown-?up people in movies. \u201cI'd like you to have something you actually remember me giving you,\u201c Eric says with a rueful smile, then nods at the box. \u201dOpen it.\u201c I pry it openand find a single diamond strung on a gold chain. \u201dLike it?\u201c \u201dIt's... it's amazing!\u201c I stammer. \u201dI love it! Thank you so much!\u201c Eric reaches over and strokes my hair. \u201dIt's good to have you home, Lexi.\u201c \u201dIt's good to be home,\u201c I reply with fervor. Which is almost true. I can't honestly say this place feels like home yet. But it feels like a really swish five-?star hotel, which is even better. I take out the diamond and look at it in awe. Meanwhile Eric is playing idly with a strand of my hair, a tender expression on his face. \u201dEric,\u201c I say, a bit shyly. \u201dWhen we first met, what did you see in me? Why did you fall in love with me?\u201c A reminiscent smile flickers across Eric's face. \u201dI fell in love with you, Lexi,\u201c he says, \u201dbecause you're dynamic. You're efficient. You're hungry for success, like me. People call us hard, but we're not. We're just intensely competitive.\u201c \u201dRight,\u201c I say after a slight pause. To be honest, I've never thought of myself as that intensely competitive. But then, maybe I am in 2007. \u201dAnd I fell in love with your beautiful mouth.\u201c Eric touches my top lip gently. \u201dAnd your long legs. And the way you swing your briefcase.\u201d He called me beautiful. I'm listening, entranced. I want him to go on forever. No one has ever spoken to me like this, in my whole life. \u201cI'll leave you now.\u201d He kisses me on the forehead 112 and picks up the tray. \u201cYou sleep well. See you in the morning.\u201d \u201cSee you then,\u201d I murmur. \"Good night, Eric. And...</p><p>thank you!\" He closes the door and I'm left alone with my necklace and my marriage manual and my glow of euphoria. I have the dream husband. No, I have the fretter-?than-?a-?dream husband. He brought me chicken soup and gave me a diamond and fell in love with the way I swing my briefcase. I must have been Gandhi.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Flossingp. 79 Food, see also Daily Meals, Kitchen; Eating Outp. 20 Foreplayp. 21 No way. He put in a section on foreplay? I've been flicking through the marriage manual ever since I woke up this morningand it's totally, utterly riveting. I feel like I'm spying on my own life. Not to mention Eric's. I know everything, from where he buys his cuff links to what he thinks of the government to the fact that he checks his scrotum for lumps every month. (Which is a bit more than I bargained for. Did he have to mention his scrotum?) It's breakfast time, and we're both sitting in the kitchen. Eric's reading the Financial Times, and I was consulting the index to see what I normally eat. But Foreplay looks a whole lot more interesting than Food. Surreptitiously I turn to page twenty-?one. 114 Oh my God. He seriously has written three paragraphs on foreplay! Under General Routine. \u201c... sweeping, regular motion... normally clockwise direction . . . gentle stimulation of the inner thighs...\u201d I splutter on my coffee and Eric looks up. \u201cAll right, darling?\u201d He smiles. \u201cIs the manual helpful? Are you finding everything you need?\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d I hastily flick to another section, feeling like a kid looking up rude words in the dictionary. \u201cI was just finding out what I usually have for breakfast.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGianna's left some scrambled egg and bacon in the oven,\u201d says Eric. \u201cAnd you usually have some green juice.\u201d He gestures at a jug of what looks like sludgy marsh water on the counter. \u201cIt's a vitamin drink and natural appetite suppressant.\u201d I suppress a shudder. \u201cI think I'll give that a miss today.\u201d I take some egg and bacon from the oven and try to quell my longing for three slices of granary toast to go with it. \u201cYour new car should be delivered later on.\u201d Eric takes a sip of coffee. \u201cThe replacement for the one that was damaged. Although I'm guessing you won't want to drive in a hurry.\u201d \u201cI hadn't really thought about it,\u201d I say helplessly. \u201cWell, we'll see. You can't yet, anyway, until you've retaken your driving test.\u201d He wipes his mouth with a linen napkin and gets up. \u201cThere was another thing, Lexi. If you don't mind, I'd like to schedule a small dinner party for next week. Just a few old friends.\u201d \u201cA dinner party?\u201d I echo, apprehensive. I've never really been the dinner-?party-?throwing type. Unless you count pasta on the sofa in front of Will &amp; Grace as a dinner party. \u201cThere's nothing to worry about.\u201d He puts his hands gently on my shoulders. \u201cGianna will do the catering. All you have to do is look wonderful. But if you're not up to it, we can forget the idea.\u201d \u201cOf course I'm up to it!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cI'm tired of everyone treating me like I'm an invalid. I feel great!\u201d \u201cWell, that brings me to another subject. Work.\u201d Eric shrugs on his jacket. \u201cObviously you're not up to returning full-?time just yet, but Simon was wondering if you'd like to go into the office for a visit. Simon Johnson,\u201d he clarifies. \u201cDo you remember him?\u201d \u201cSimon Johnson? The managing director?\u201d \u201cUh-?huh.\u201d Eric nods. \u201cHe called here last night. We had a good chat. Nice guy.\u201d \u201cI didn't think he'd even heard of me!\u201d I say in disbelief. \u201cLexi, you're an important member of the senior management team,\u201d Eric says patiently. \u201cOf course he's heard of you.\u201c \u201dOh, right. Of course.\u201c I chew my bacon, trying to look nonchalantbut inside, I want to cheer. This new life of mine gets better and better. I'm an important member of the senior management team! Simon Johnson knows who I am! Eric is continuing. \u201dWe agreed it would be helpful for you to visit the office. It might help bring back your memory as well as give reassurance to your department.\u201c \u201dI think it's a great idea,\u201c I say with enthusiasm. \u201dI could get to know my job again, see all the girls... We could have lunch.\u201c \u201dYour deputy is standing in for you at the moment,\u201c Eric says, consulting a notepad on the kitchen counter. \u201dByron Foster. Just till you return, obviously.\u201c \u201dByron's my deputy now?\u201c I say incredulously. \u201dBut Byron used to be my boss!\u201c 116 Everything's upside down. Everything's unrecognizable. I can't wait to get to the office and see what's been going on. Eric taps something into his BlackBerry, then puts it away and picks up his briefcase. \u201dHave a good day, darling.\u201c \u201dYou t o o . . . e r . . . darling!\u201c I stand up as he turns to face meand there's a sudden frisson bepween us. Eric's standing only inches away from me. I can just smell his aftershave and see a little nick on his neck where he cut himself shaving. \u201dI haven't read the whole manual yet.\u201c I suddenly feel awkward. \u201dWould I normally... kiss you good-?bye at this point?\u201c \u201dYou normally would, yes.\u201c Eric sounds stiff too. \u201dBut please don't feel you\u201c \u201dNo! I want to! I mean... we should do everything just like we usually do.\u201c I'm getting a bit pink in the face here. \u201dSo, would I kiss you on the cheek, o r . . . or the lips...\u201c \u201dThe lips.\u201c Eric clears his throat. \u201dThat would be the usual.\u201c \u201dRight.\u201c I nod. \u201dSo...um...\u201c I reach out for his waist, trying to appear natural. \u201dLike this? Tell me if it's not the way I normally do i t . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cProbably just one hand,\u201d Eric says after a moment's thought. \u201cAnd it's usually a bit higher up.\u201d \u201cOkay!\u201d I shift one hand up to his shoulder and drop the other down, feeling as if I'm ballroom dancing. Then, keeping in position as best I can, I tilt my face up.</p><p>Eric has a strange little nodule on the end of his tongue, I suddenly notice. Okay... I won't look at it. Concentrate on the kiss. He leans forward and his mouth brushes briefly against mine, and I feel... nothing.</p><p>I was hoping our first kiss would trigger all sorts of memories or sensations, maybe a sudden image of Paris or our wedding, or our first snog But as he draws away I feel totally, one hundred percent blank. I can see the anticipation in Eric's face and quickly search for something encouraging to say. \u201cThat was lovely! Very...\u201d I trail off, unable to think of a single word other than quick, which I'm not sure hits the right note. \u201cIt didn't bring back any memories?\u201d Eric is studying my face. \u201cWell...no,\u201d I say apologetically. \u201cBut, I mean, that doesn't mean it wasn't really... I mean it was... I feel quite turned on!\u201d The words come out before I can stop them. What the hell did I say that for? I don't feel turned on. \u201cReally?\u201d Eric lights up and he puts his briefcase down. Oh no. No no no. Nooo. I cannot possibly have sex with Eric yet. Number one, I don't even know him, hardly. Number two, I haven't read what happens after gentle stimulation of the inner thighs. \u201cNot that turned on,\u201d I amend hastily. \u201cI mean, just enough to know... to realize... I mean obviously we have a great... when it comes to the bedroom... um... arena...\u201d Stop. Talking. Lexi. Now. \u201cAnyway.\u201d I smile as brightly as I can manage. \u201cHave a great day.\u201d \u201cYou too.\u201d Eric touches my cheek gently, then turns and strides off. I hear the door close, and subside into a chair. That was a bit close. I reach for the marriage manual and quickly flick to the \u201cF\u201d section. I need to read up on Foreplay. 118 Not to mention Fellatio, I suddenly notice. And Frequency (Sexual).</p><p>This could take me a while. Two hours and three cups of coffee later, I close the manual and lean back, my head bursting with information. I've read it cover to cover, and I've pretty much got the whole picture. I've learned that Eric and I often spend weekends away at \u201cluxury boutique hotels.\u201d I've learned that we enjoy watching business documentaries and The West Wing. And we had differing views on Brokeback Mountain. Which I've also learned was a film about gay cowboys. (Gay cowboys?) I've learned that Eric and I share a love of wine from the Bordeaux region. I've learned that I'm \u201cdriven\u201d and \u201cfocused\u201d and \u201cwork 24-7 to get the job done.\u201d I've learned I \u201cdon't suffer fools gladly,\u201d \u201cdespise time-?wasters,\u201d and am \u201csomeone who appreciates the finer things in life.\u201d Which is kind of news to me. I get up and walk to the window, trying to digest everything I've read. The more I learn about twenty-?eight-?yearold Lexi, the more I feel like she's a different person from me. She doesn't just look different. She is different. She's a boss. She wears beige designer clothes and La Perla underwear. She knows about wine. She never eats bread. She's a grown-?up. That's what she is. I gaze into the mirror and my twenty-?eight-?year-?old face stares back. How on earth did I get from me... to her? On impulse I get up and head into the bedroom, then through that into the clothes room. There have to be some clues somewhere. I sit down at my smart, minimalist dressing table, and regard it silently. 119 I mean, look at this, for a start. My old dressing table was painted pink and a total messall scarves, necklaces looped over the mirror, and jars of makeup everywhere. But this is immaculate. Silver jars in rows, a single dish containing one pair of earrings, and an art deco hand mirror. I open a drawer at random and find a pile of neatly folded scarves, on top of which is a shiny DVD marked Ambition: EPl in felt-?tip marker. I pick it up, puzzledand then suddenly realize what it is. It's that program Amy was talking about. This is me on the telly! Oh my God, I have to see this. First because I'm dying to know what I looked like. And second because it's another piece of the puzzle. This reality show is where Eric first saw me. It gave me my big break at work. I probably had no idea at the time how crucial it was going to be. I hurry into the living room, eventually manage to locate the DVD player behind a translucent panel, and slot it in. Soon the program titles are rolling on all the wall-?mounted screens throughout the flat. I fast-?forward until my face appears onscreen, then press Play. I'm prepared to cringe with embarrassment and duck behind the sofa. But actually...I don't look that bad! My teeth have already been veneered or capped or whatever although my mouth looks much thinner than it does now. (I have definitely had collagen injections.) My chestnut hair's been blow-?dried and tied back in a ponytail. I'm wearing a black suit and an aquamarine shirt and I look totally businesslike. \u201cI need to succeed,\u201d I'm saying to an off-?camera interviewer. \u201cI need to win this.\u201d Blimey. I look so serious. I don't understand it. Why did I suddenly want to win a reality business show? \u201cGood morning, Lexi!\u201d A voice makes me practically 120 jump out of my skin. I jab at Stop on the remote and turn around to see a woman in her fifties. She has dark, graystreaked hair tied back; she's wearing a flowery overall; and she's holding a plastic bucket full of cleaning things. An iPod is clipped to her overall pocket and from the speakers in her ears I can just hear the strains of opera. \u201cYou're up!\u201d she says in a piercing voice. \u201cHow you feeling? Any better today?\u201d Her accent is hard to place, kind of cockney mixed with Italian. \u201cAre you Gianna?\u201d I say cautiously. \u201cOh my Lord in heaven.\u201d She crosses herself and kisses her fingers. \u201cEric warned me. You're not right in the head, poor girl.\u201d \u201cI'm fine, really,\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cI've just lost a bit of memory. So I'm having to learn everything about my life again.\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, I am Gianna.\u201d She hits her chest. \u201cGreat!

Er... I was. Just to remind myself.\u201d I hastily turn it off. Meanwhile Gianna has started polishing a display of picture frames. I twist my fingers awkwardly. How can I just stand here, watching another woman clean my house? Should I offer to help? \u201cWhat would you like me to cook for dinner tonight?\u201d she says, starting to plump up the cushions on the sofa. \u201cOh,\u201d I say, looking up in horror. \u201cNothing! Really!\u201d</p><p>I know Eric and I are all rich and everything, but I can't ask someone else to cook my supper.

I just thought... maybe I'd do the cooking myself tonight.\u201d \u201cOh, I see,\u201d she says. \u201cWell, it's up to you.\u201d Her face set, she picks up a cushion and bangs it out with more vigor. \u201cI hope you enjoyed the soup last night,\u201d she adds, without looking at me. \u201cIt was delicious!\u201d I say hastily. \u201cThanks! Lovely... flavors.\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d she says in a stiff voice. \u201cI do my best.\u201d Oh God. She isn't offended, is she? \u201cLet me know what you'd like me to buy for you to cook,\u201d she continues, slapping the cushion down. \u201cIf you're after something new, or different...\u201d Shit. She is offended. \u201cOr...er...well.\u201d My voice is scratchy with nerves. \u201cActually, on second thought... maybe you could make a little something. But I mean, don't make any effort. Just a sandwich would be fine.\u201c \u201dA sandwich?\u201c She raises her head incredulously. \u201dFor your dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr...whatever you like! Whatever you enjoy cooking!\u201d Even as I say the words I know how stupid this sounds. I back away, pick up a property magazine that's lying on a side table, and open it at a piece about fountains.</p><p>How am I ever going to get used to all this? How did I turn into someone with a housekeeper, for God's sake? \u201cAiee! The sofa has been damaged!\u201d Gianna's accent suddenly sounds far more Italian than cockney. She yanks her iPod speakers out of her ears and gestures at the torn 122 fabric in horror. \u201cLook! Ripped! Yesterday morning it was perfect.\u201d She looks at me defensively. \u201cI tell youI left it in good condition, no rips, no marks...\u201d The blood rushes to my head. \u201cThat... that was me.\u201d I stammer. \u201cI did it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a mistake,\u201d I gabble. \u201cI didn't mean to. I broke this glass leopard and...\u201d I'm breathing hard. \u201cI'll order another sofa cover, I promise. But please don't tell Eric. He doesn't know.\u201d \u201cHe doesn't know?\u201d Gianna seems bewildered. \u201cI put the cushion over the rip.\u201d I swallow. \u201cTo hide it.\u201d Gianna stares at me for a few disbelieving moments. I stare back pleadingly, unable to breathe. Then her severe face creases into a laugh. She puts down the cushion she's holding and pats me on the arm. \u201cI'll sew it. Little tiny stitches. He'll never know.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d I feel a wash of relief. \u201cOh, thank God. That would be wonderful. I'd be so grateful.\u201d Gianna is surveying me with a perplexed frown, her broad arms folded across her chest. \u201cYou're sure nothing happened when you bumped your head?\u201d she says at last. \u201cLike... personality transplant?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d I give an uncertain laugh. \u201cI don't think s o . . .\u201d The door buzzer goes off. \u201cOh, I'd better get this.\u201d I hurry to the front door and lift the answer phone. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d comes a guttural voice. \u201cCar delivery for Gardiner.\u201d My new car is parked in a place at the front of the building, which according to the porter is my own private spot. It's a silver Mercedes, which I can tell from the badge-?thing on the front. And it's a convertible. Apart from that, I couldn't tell you much about itexcept I'm guessing it cost a fortune. \u201cSign here... and here...\u201d The deliveryman is holding out a clipboard. \u201cOkay.\u201d I scribble on the paper. \u201cHere's your keys... all your paperwork. Cheers, love.\u201d The guy retrieves his pen from my hand and heads out the gates, leaving me alone with the car, a bundle of papers, and a set of shiny car keys. I dangle them in my fingers, feeling a frisson of excitement. I've never been a car person. But then, I've never been this close to a glossy, brand-?new Mercedes before. A brand-?new Mercedes which is all mine. Maybe I'll just check it over inside. With an instinctive gesture I hold out the key fob and press the little button then jump as the car bleeps and all the lights flash on. Well, I've obviously done that before. I open the door, slide into the driver's seat, and inhale deeply. Wow. Now, this is a car. This knocks Loser Dave's crappy Renault out of the park. It has the most wonderful, intoxicating scent of new leather. The seats are wide and comfortable. The dashboard is gleaming wood veneer. Cautiously I place my hands on the steering wheel. They seem to grip it quite naturallyin fact, they seem to belong there. I really don't want to take them off. I sit there for a few moments, watching the entry gates rise and fall as a BMW drives out. The thing i s . . . I can drive. At some stage I must have passed my test, even if I don't remember doing it. And this is such a cool car. It would be a shame not to have a go. Experimentally I push the key into the slot beside the 124 steering wheeland it fits! I rotate it forward, like I've seen people do, and there's a kind of roar of protest from the engine. Shit. What did I do? I turn it forward again, more cautiously, and this time there's no roar, but a few lights pop on around the dashboard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now what? I survey the controls hopefully for inspiration, but none comes. I have no idea how to work this thing, is the truth. I have no memory of driving a car in my life.</p><p>But the point i s . . . I have done it. It's like walking in heelsit's a skill locked away inside me. What I need is to let my body take over. If I can just distract myself enough, then maybe I'll find myself driving automatically. I place my hands firmly on the steering wheel. Here we go. Think about other things. La la la. Don't think about driving. Just let your body do what comes naturally. Maybe I should sing a songthat worked before. \u201c 'Land of hope and gloree,'\u201d I begin tunelessly, \u201c 'mother of the freeee.. .\u201d Oh my God. It's working. My hands and feet are moving in synch. I don't dare look at them; I don't dare register what they're doing. All I know is I've switched on the engine and pushed down on one of the pedals and there's a kind of rumbling and... I did it! I switched on the car! I can hear the engine throbbing, as if it wants to get going. Okay, keep calm. I take a deep breathbut deep inside I'm already a bit panicky. I'm sitting at the controls of a Mercedes and the engine's running and I'm not even sure how that happened. Right. Collect yourself, Lexi. Hand brake. I know what that is. And the gear stick. Cautiously I release bothand at once the car moves forward.</p><p>Hastily I press my foot down on one of the pedals, to stop it, and the car bucks with an ominous grinding noise. Shit. That didn't sound good. I release my footand the car creeps forward again. I'm not sure I want it doing that. Trying to stay calm, I press my foot down again, hard. But this time it doesn't even stop, it just keeps going inexorably forward. I thrust againand it revs up like a racing car. \u201cShit!\u201d I say, almost gibbering in fear. \"Okay, just...</p><p>stop. Stay!\u201c I'm pulling back on the wheel, but it's making no difference. I don't know how to control this thing. We're slowly heading toward an expensive-?looking sports car parked opposite and I don't know how to stop. In desperation I thrust both feet down again, hitting two pedals at once with a shrieking, engine-?breaking sound. Oh God, Oh God... My face is hot; my hands are sweating. I never should have gotten into this car. If I crash it, Eric will divorce me and I won't blame him \u201cStop!\u201d I cry again. \u201cPlease!\u201d Suddenly I notice a dark-?haired man in jeans coming in at the gates. He sees me gliding forward toward the sports car and his whole face jolts. \u201cStop!\u201d he yells, his voice faint through the window. \u201cI can't stop!\u201d I yell back desperately. \u201cSteer!\u201d He mimes steering. The steering wheel. Of course. I'm a moron. I wrench it around to the right, nearly dragging my arms out of my sockets, and manage to turn the car off course. Only now I'm heading straight toward a brick wall. \u201cBrake!\u201d The guy is running alongside me. \u201cBrake, Lexi!\u201d \u201cBut I don't\u201d \u201cFor God's sake, brake!\u201d he yells. The hand brake, I suddenly remember. Quick. I yank it 126 back with both hands and the car stops with a judder. The engine is still running, but at least the car is stationary. And at least I haven't hit anything. My breath is coming fast and hoarse; my hands are still clenched around the hand brake. I'm never driving again. Never. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d The guy is at my window. After a few moments I manage to unclench one of my hands from the hand brake. I jab randomly at the buttons on the car door until the window winds down. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he says. \u201c I . . . panicked. I can't actually drive a car. I thought I'd remember how to, but I had a bit of a panic attack.\u201d Suddenly, with no warning, I feel a tear running down my face. \u201cI'm sorry,\u201d I gulp. \u201dI'm a bit freaked out. I've had amnesia, you see...\u201c I look up to see the guy just staring at me as if I'm talking a foreign language. He's got a pretty striking face, now that I come to notice it. High cheekbones, dark gray eyes, and slanted eyebrows gathered in a frown, with dark brown untidy hair. He's wearing a plain gray T-?shirt over his jeans, and he looks a bit older than me, maybe early thirties. He also seems totally dumbfounded. Which I guess is not surprising, bearing in mind he's just come into a car park, minding his own business, to find a girl crashing a car and saying she has amnesia. Maybe he doesn't believe me, I think, suddenly alarmed. Maybe he thinks I'm drunk-?driving and this is all some invented excuse. \u201dI was in a car crash a few days ago,\u201c I explain hurriedly. \u201dI really was. I hit my head. Look.\u201c I point to the remaining cuts on my face. \u201dI know you were in a car crash,\u201c he says at last. He has a very distinctive voice, dry and kind of intense. As though every word he speaks really, really matters. \u201cI heard about it.\u201d \u201cWait a minute!\u201d I click my tongue, suddenly realizing. \u201cYou called out my name. Do we know each other?\u201d A jolt of shock passes over the guy's face. I can see his eyes studying me almost as though he doesn't believe me; as though he's searching for something. \u201cYou don't remember me?\u201d he says at last. \u201cUm, no,\u201d I say with an apologetic shrug. \u201cI'm sorry, I'm not being rude; I don't remember anyone I've met in the last three years. My friends... my husband, even. He was a total stranger to me! My own husband! Can you believe it?\u201d I smilebut the guy doesn't smile back or express sympathy. In fact, his expression almost makes me nervous. \u201cDo you want me to park that for you?\u201d he says abruptly. \u201cOh. Yes, please.\u201d I glance anxiously at my left hand, still clutching the hand brake. \u201cCan I let go of this? Will the car roll away?\u201d A tiny smile flickers over his face. \u201dNo. It won't roll away. You can let go.\u201c Cautiously I unfurl my hand, which had practically seized up, and shake out the stiffness. \u201dThanks so much,\u201c I say, getting out. \u201dThis is my brandnew car. If I'd crashed it, I can't even think...\u201c I wince at the idea. \u201dMy husband got it for me, to replace the other one. Do you know him? Eric Gardiner?\u201c \u201dYes,\u201c he says after a pause. \u201dI know him.\u201c He gets into the car, shuts the door, and signals to me to get out of the way. The next moment he's expertly reversed the car safely back into its parking spot. \u201dThanks,\u201c I say fervently as he gets out. \u201dI really appreciate it.\u201c 128 I wait for the guy to say \u201dIt's no trouble\u201c or \u201dAny time,\u201c but he seems lost in thought. \u201dWhat did they say about the amnesia?\u201c he says, suddenly looking up. \u201dHave your memories gone forever?\u201c \u201dThey might come back anytime,\u201c I explain. \u201dOr they might not. No one knows. I'm just trying to learn about my life again. Eric's being really helpful and teaching me all about our marriage and everything. He's the most perfect husband!\u201c I smile again, attempting to lighten the atmosphere. \u201dSo... where do you fit into the picture?\u201c There's no response at all from the dark-?haired guy. He's shoved his hands in his pockets and is staring up at the sky. I really don't know what his problem is. At last he lowers his head and surveys me again, his face all screwed up, as though he's in pain. Maybe he is. Maybe he has a headache or something. \u201dI have to go,\u201c he says. \u201dOh, right. Well, thanks again,\u201c I say politely. \u201dAnd very nice to meet you. I mean, I know we've met before in my previous life, but... you know what I mean!\u201c I hold out a hand to shake hisbut he just looks at it as though it makes no sense to him at all. \u201dBye, Lexi.\u201c He turns on his heel. \u201dBye...\" I call after him, then trail off. What a weird guy. He never even told me his name.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 9</p><p>Fi is one of the most straightforward people I know. We met at the age of six, when I was the new girl in the school playground. She was already a head taller than me, her dark hair in hunches, her voice booming and confident. She told me my plastic skipping rope was rubbish and loudly listed all its faults. Then, just as I was about to start crying, she offered me hers to play with.</p><p>That's Fi. She can upset people with her bluntness, and she knows it. When she's said the wrong thing she rolls her eyes and claps a hand over her mouth. But underneath it all, she's warmhearted and kind. And she's great in meetings. When other people waffle on, she gets right to the point, no bullshit. It was Fi who gave me the idea of applying to Deller Carpets. She'd been working there for two years when Frenshaws, the company I was at before, got taken over by a Spanish company and a bunch of us were laid off. There was an opening in 130 the Flooring department, and Fi suggested I bring my CV in to show Gavin, her boss... and that was it. I had a job. Since working together, Fi and I have become even closer. We have lunch together, we go to the cinema on the weekend, we send text messages to each other while Gavin is trying to give one of his \u201cteam bollockings,\u201d as he calls them. I'm close to Carolyn and Debs toobut Fi's the one I ring up first with news; the one I think of when something funny happens. Which is why it's so weird that she hasn't been in touch. I've texted her several more times since I got out of hospital. I've left two messages on voice mail. I've sent a few jokey e-?mails and even written a card thanking her for the flowers. But I haven't heard a word back. Maybe she's just busy, I keep telling myself. Or she's been on some work residential seminar thing, or she's got the flu There's a million good reasons. Anyway, I'm going in to work today, so I'll see her. And everyone. I stare at myself in the huge mirror in my dressing room. 2004-Lexi used to show up at the office in a pair of black trousers from Next, a shirt from the bargain bin at New Look, and a pair of loafers with chewed-?up heels. Not anymore. I'm in the crispest shirt I've ever worn in my life, all expensive Prada double cuffs. I'm wearing a black suit with a pencil skirt and a nipped-?in waist. My legs are gleaming in Charnos sheer gloss tights. My shoes are patent and spiky. My hair is blow-?dried and twisted up into my signature chignon. I look like an illustration from a child's picture book. Boss Lady. Eric comes into the room and I do a twirl. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d He nods, but doesn't seem surprised at my appearance. I suppose to him this kind of outfit is normal. Whereas I can't imagine this ever feeling like anything other than dressing up. \u201cAll set?\u201d \u201cI guess!\u201d I pick up my baga black Bottega Veneta tote I found in the cupboard. I tried asking Eric about Fi yesterdaybut he barely seemed to know who she was, even though she's my oldest friend and was at our wedding and everything. The only friend of mine he seems to know about is Rosalie, which is because she's married to Clive. Anyway, it's fine. I'll see Fi today, and there'll be some explanation, and everything will fall back into place. I expect we'll all go out for a drink at lunchtime and have a good old catch-?up. \u201cNow, don't forget this!\u201d Eric is opening a cupboard in the corner. He retrieves a sleek black briefcase and hands it to me. \u201cI gave it to you when we were married.\u201d \u201cWow, this is beautiful!\u201d It's made of buttery-?soft calfskin and on the front are discreetly embossed initials: L.G. \u201cI know you still use your maiden name for work,\u201d says Eric, \u201cbut I wanted you to take a little piece of me to the office with you every day.\u201c He is so romantic. He is so perfect. \u201dI must go. The car will be here to pick you up in five minutes. Have a good time.\u201c He kisses me and heads out. As I hear the front door close I pick up my briefcase and look at it, wondering what to put in it. I've never used a briefcase beforeI always just shoved everything into my bag. Eventually I take a packet of tissues and some Polos out of my bag and put them into the briefcase. Then I add a 132 pen. I feel like I'm packing for my first day at a new school. As I'm sliding the pen into a silk pocket, my fingers bump against something thin, like a card, and I pull it out. It's not a card; it's an old photo of me, Fi, Debs, and Carolyn. Before I had my hair done. When my teeth were still all snaggly. We're in a bar, all dressed up in glittery tops with rosy cheeks and party-?popper streamers over our heads. Fi has her arm clenched around my neck and I have a cocktail umbrella in my teeth, and we're all in hysterics. I can't help grinning at the sight. I remember that evening really well. Debs had chucked her awful banker boyfriend, Mitchell, and we were on a mission to help her forget. Halfway through the evening, when Mitchell called Debs's mobile, Carolyn answered and pretended to be a \u00a31,000 Russian call girl who thought she was being booked. Carolyn took Russian in school, so she was quite convincing, and Mitchell got genuinely rattled, no matter what he claimed later. We were all listening on speakerphone and I thought I'd die of laughter. Still smiling, I slide the photo back into the pocket and snap the briefcase shut. I pick it up and regard myself in the mirror. Boss Lady Goes to Work. \u201dHi,\u201c I say to my reflection, trying to adopt a businesslike tone. \u201dHi, there. Lexi Smart, Director of Flooring. Yup, hi. I'm the boss.\u201d Oh God. I don't feel like a boss. Maybe I'll snap back into it when I get there. Deller Carpets is the company everyone remembers from the TV ads back in the eighties. The first one showed a woman lying on some blue swirling patterned carpet in a shop, pretending it was so soft and luxurious she immedi 133 ately had to have sex on it with the nerdy sales assistant. Then there was the follow-?up ad where she married the nerdy assistant and had the whole aisle carpeted in flowery Deller carpet. And then they had twins, who couldn't sleep unless they had blue and pink Deller carpet in their cribs. They were pretty tacky ads, but they did make Deller Carpets a household name. Which is part of its trouble. The company tried to change its name a few years ago, to just Deller. There was a new logo and mission statement and everything. But nobody took any notice of that. You say you work at Deller and people frown and then they say, \u201cYou mean Deller Carpets?\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It's even more ironic because carpet is only a fraction of the company these days. About ten years ago the maintenance department started producing a carpet cleaner that was sold by mail order and became incredibly popular. They expanded into all sorts of cleaning products and gadgets, and now the mail-?order business is huge. So are soft furnishings and fabrics. But poor old carpets have fallen by the wayside. Trouble is, they're not cool these days. It's all slate and laminate wood flooring. We do sell laminate flooringbut hardly anyone realizes we do, because they think we're still called Deller Carpets. It's like one big vicious circle that all leads back to shag. I know carpets aren't cool. And I know patterned carpets are even less cool. But secretly, I really love them. Especially all the old retro designs from the seventies. I've got an old pattern book on my desk, which I always flick through when I'm in the middle of a long, tedious phone conversation. And once I found a whole box of old samples at the warehouse. No one wanted them, so I took them back to the office and pinned them up on the wall next to my desk. That's to say, my old desk. I guess I've been upgraded 134 now. As I head toward the familiar building on Victoria Palace Road, I feel a fizz of anticipation in my stomach. It's the same as it ever was: a tall, pale gray block with granite pillars at the entrance. I push open the glass doors to reception and stop in surprise. The foyer is different. It looks really cool! They've moved the desk, and there are glass partitions where there used to be a wall... and the flooring is blue metallic-?effect vinyl. There must be a new range out. \u201cLexi!\u201d A plump woman in a pink shirt and tapered black trousers is bustling toward me. She has highlights and fuchsia lipstick and pumps and she's called...I know her... head of human resources... \u201cDana.\u201d I gasp the name in relief. \u201cHi.\u201d \u201cLexi.\u201d She holds out a hand to shake mine. \u201cWelcome back! You poor thing! We were all so upset to hear what happened...\u201d \u201cI'm fine, thanks. A lot better.\u201d I follow her over the shiny vinyl floor, take a security pass from her, and swipe my way through the security entrance. This is all new too. We didn't use to have barriers, just a guard called Reg. \u201cGood! Well, come this way...\u201d Dana's ushering me along. \u201cI thought we could have a short chat in my office, pop in on the budget meeting, and then you'll want to see your department!\u201d \u201cGreat! Good idea.\u201d My department. I used to just have a desk and a stapler. We travel up in the lift and get out at the second floor, and Dana ushers me into her office. \u201cTake a seat.\u201d She pulls out a plushy chair and sits down at her desk. \u201cSo now, obviously, we need to talk about your... condition.\u201d She lowers her voice discreetly as though I have some embarrassing ailment. \u201cYou have amnesia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat's right. Apart from that, I'm pretty much okay.\u201d \u201cGood!\u201d She scribbles something on her pad of paper. \u201cAnd is this amnesia permanent or temporary?\u201d \u201cWell...the doctors said I might start remembering things at any time.\u201d \u201cMarvelous!\u201d Her face brightens. \u201cObviously, from our point of view it would be great if you could remember everything by the twenty-?first. That's when our sales conference is,\u201d she adds, giving me an expectant look. \u201cRight,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cI'll do my best.\u201d \u201cYou can't do better than that!\u201d She trills with laughter and pushes back her chair. \u201cNow, let's go and say hello to Simon and the others. You remember Simon Johnson, the MD?\u201d \u201cOf course!\u201d</p><p>How could I not remember the boss of the whole company? I remember him giving a speech at the Christmas party. I remember him appearing in our office and asking our names while Gavin, our department head then, followed him around like a lackey. And now I go to meetings with him! Trying to conceal my nerves, I follow Dana down the corridor and up in the lift again to the eighth floor. She leads me briskly to the boardroom, knocks on the heavy door, and pushes it open. \u201cSorry to interrupt! Only Lexi's popped in for a visit.\u201d \u201cLexi! Our superstar!\u201d Simon Johnson stands up from his seat at the head of the table. He has a tall, broadshouldered, ex-?army-?officer frame and thinning brown hair. He comes over, clasps my hand as if we're old friends, and kisses my cheek. \u201cHow are you feeling, my dear?\u201d Simon Johnson just kissed me. The MD of the whole company kissed me. 136 \u201cEr...fine, thanks!\u201d I try to keep my composure. \u201cMuch better.\u201d I glance around the room, taking in a whole bunch of other high-?powered company people in suits. Byron, who used to be my direct boss, is sitting on the other side of the conference table. He's pale and lanky with dark hair, and wearing one of his trademark retro-?print ties. He gives me a pinched smile and I grin back, relieved to recognize someone else. \u201cYou had quite a knock to the head, we understand,\u201d Simon Johnson is saying in his mellifluous public-?school voice. \u201cThat's right.\u201d \u201cWell, hurry back!\u201d he exclaims with mock urgency. \u201cByron here is standing in for you very well.\u201d He gestures at Byron. \u201cBut whether you can trust him to safeguard your department's budget...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don't know.\u201d I raise my eyebrows. \u201cShould I be worried?\u201d There's an appreciative laugh around the table, and I notice Byron shooting me daggers. Honestly. I was only making a joke.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, though, Lexi. I need to talk to you about our recent... discussions.\u201d Simon Johnson gives me a meaningful nod. \u201cWe'll have lunch when you get back properly.\u201d \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d I match his confidential tone, even though I have no idea what he's talking about. \u201cSimon.\u201d Dana steps forward, lowering her voice a smidgen. \u201cThe doctors don't know whether Lexi's amnesia is permanent or temporary. So she may have some problems with memory...\u201d \u201cProbably an advantage, in this business,\u201d says a balding man opposite, and there's another chuckle around the table. \u201cLexi, I have every confidence in you,\u201d Simon Johnson says firmly. He turns to a red-?haired guy sitting nearby. \u201cDaniel, you two haven't met yet, have you? Daniel is our new finance controller. Daniel, you might have seen Lexi on television?\u201d \u201cThat's right!\u201d I can see recognition dawning on the guy's face as we shake hands. \u201cSo you're the whiz kid I've heard about.\u201d Whiz kid? \u201cEr... I don't think so,\u201d I say uncertainly, and there's a laugh. \u201cDon't be modest!\u201d Simon gives me a warm smile, then turns to Daniel. \u201cThis young woman has had the most meteoric rise through this company. From associate junior sales manager to director of her department within eighteen months. As I've said many times to Lexi herself, it was a gamble, giving her the jobbut I've never regretted taking that risk for a moment. She's a natural leader. She's inspirational. She puts in twenty-?four hours a day; she has some exciting strategic visions for the future This is a very, very talented member of the company.\u201d As he finishes, Simon is beaming at me; so are the balding guy and a couple of the others.</p><p>I'm in a state of total shock. My face is puce; my legs are wobbling. No one's ever spoken about me like that. Ever, my whole life. \u201cWell... thanks!\u201d I stutter at last.</p><p>\u201cLexi.\u201d Simon gestures at an empty chair. \u201cCan we tempt you to stay for the budget meeting?\u201d \u201cEr...\u201d I glance at Dana for help. 138 \u201cShe's not staying long today, Simon,\u201d says Dana. \u201cWe're popping down to Flooring now.\u201d \u201cOf course.\u201d He nods. \u201cWell, you're missing a treat. Everyone loves a budget meeting.\u201d His eyes crinkle with humor.</p> <p>\u201cDon't you realize I did this to avoid the budget meeting?\u201d I gesture at the last remaining graze on my head and there's another huge laugh around the room. \u201cSee you soon, Lexi,\u201d Simon says. \u201cLook after yourself.\u201d As Dana and I leave the boardroom I'm light-?headed with exhilaration. I can't quite believe all that just happened. I bantered with Simon Johnson. I'm a whiz kid! I have strategic visions of the future! I just hope I wrote them down somewhere.</p><p>\u201cSo, you remember where the Flooring department is?\u201d Dana says as we descend again in the lift. \u201cI know everyone's eager to see you.\u201d \u201cMe too!\u201d I say with growing confidence. We head out of the lift and Dana's phone gives a little chirrup. \u201cOh dear!\u201d she says as she glances at it. \u201cI should take this. Do you want to pop along to your office and I'll see you in there?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I stride down the corridor. It looks just the same as it ever did, with the same brown carpet and fire notices and plastic plants. The Flooring department is just along, to the left. And to the right is Gavin's office. I mean my office. My own private office. I stand outside the door for a moment, psyching myself to go in. I still can't quite believe it's my office. My job. Come on. There's nothing to be scared of. I can do this job, Simon Johnson said so. As I reach for the door handle, I see a girl of about twenty darting out of the main office.</p><p>Her hands go to her mouth. 139 \u201cOh!\u201d she says. \u201cLexi! You're back!\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d I peer uncertainly at her. \u201cYou'll have to forgive me. I've had this accident; my memory's gone...\u201d \u201cYeah, they said.\u201d She looks nervous. \u201cI'm Clare. Your assistant?\u201d \u201cOh hi! Nice to meet you! So I'm in here?\u201d I jerk my head toward Gavin's door. \u201cThat's right. Can I bring you a cup of coffee?\u201d \u201cYes, please!\u201d I try to hide my delight. \u201cThat would be great.\u201d I have an assistant who brings me cups of coffee. I have really, really made it. I step into the office and let the door close behind me with a satisfying clunk. Wow. I'd forgotten how big this room was. It has a sweeping desk and a plant and a sofa... and everything. I put my briefcase down on the desk and walk over to the window. I even have a view! Of another tall building, admittedly but still, it's mine! I'm the boss! I can't help laughing in euphoria as I swing around and jump onto the sofa. I bounce up and down a few times, then stop abruptly as there's a knocking on the door. Shit. If someone walked in right now and saw me... Catching my breath, I hurry over to the desk, pick up a random piece of paper, and start perusing it with a businesslike frown. \u201cCome in!\u201d \u201cLexi!\u201d Dana bustles in. \u201cAre you making yourself at home again? Clare told me you didn't even recognize her! This is going to be tricky for you, isn't it? I hadn't quite appreciated...\u201d She shakes her head, her brow creased. \u201cSo you don't remember anything?\u201d \u201cWell... no,\u201d I admit. \u201cBut I'm sure it'll all come back to me, sooner or later.\u201d 140 \u201cLet's hope you're right!\u201d She still looks anxious. \u201cNow, let's go through to the department, reacquaint yourself with everybody...\u201d We head outand I suddenly see Fi coming out of the Flooring office, in a short black skirt with boots and a green sleeveless top. She looks different from the way I remember her, with a new red streak in her hair and a thinner face, somehow. But it's her. She's even wearing the same set of tortoiseshell bangles she always used to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFi!\u201d I exclaim in excitement, almost dropping my bag. \u201cOh my God! It's me, Lexi! Hi! I'm back!\u201d Fi visibly starts. She turns, and for a few seconds she just gapes at me as if I'm a lunatic. I suppose I did sound a bit overexcited. But I'm just so thrilled to see her.</p><p>\u201cHi, Lexi,\u201d she says at last, eyeing my face. \u201cHow're you doing?\u201d \u201cI'm fine!\u201d I say, my words tumbling out eagerly. \u201cHow are you? You look great! I love your new hair!\u201d Everyone's staring at me now.</p><p>\u201cAnyway\u201dI force myself to sound more composed \u201cmaybe we can catch up properly later? With the others?\u201d \u201cUhyeah.\u201d Fi nods without looking me in the eye. Why is she being so off? What's wrong? Coldness clenches me around the chest. Maybe that's why she never replied to any of my messages. We've had some huge row. And the others took her side. And I just don't remember.... \u201cAfter you, Lexi!\u201d Dana ushers me into the main, openplan office. Fifteen faces look up at us and I try not to gasp. This is so weird.</p><p>I can see Carolyn, and Debs, and Melanie, and several others I know. They all look familiar... but three years on. Their hair and makeup and clothes all look different. Debs has super-?toned arms and is tanned as though she's just got back from some exotic holiday; Carolyn's wearing new rimless glasses and her hair's cropped even shorter than before . .. There's my desk. A girl with bleached hair in braids is sitting at it, looking totally at home. \u201cYou all know that Lexi has been ill following her accident,\u201d Dana is announcing to the room. \u201cWe're delighted that she's back with us today for a visit. She's suffered a few side effects from her injuries, in particular amnesia. But I'm sure you'll all help her to remember her way around and give her a big welcome back.\u201c She turns to me and murmurs, \u201dLexi, do you want to say a few motivational words to the department?\u201c \u201dMotivational words?\u201d I echo uncertainly.</p> <p>\u201cJust something inspiring.\u201d Dana beams. \u201cRally the troops.\u201d Her phone chirrups again. \u201cI'm sorry. Excuse me!\u201d She hurries out to the corridor and I'm left alone, facing my department. Come on. Simon Johnson says I'm a natural leader. I can do this. \u201cUm... hi, everyone!\u201d I give a small wave around the office, which no one returns. \u201cI just wanted to say that I'll be back soon, and...um...keep up the good work \u201d I flounder for something motivational. \u201cWho's the best department in the company? We are! Who rocks? Flooring!\u201d I give the air a little punch, like a cheerleader. \u201cF! L! O! R!\u201d \u201cThere should be another O,\u201d interrupts a girl I don't recognize. She's standing with her arms folded, looking totally unimpressed. \u201cSorry?\u201d I stop, breathless. \u201cThere's a double O in flooring.\u201d She rolls her eyes. Two 142 girls next to her are giggling into their hands, while Carolyn and Debs are just gaping at me. \u201cRight,\u201d I say, flustered. \u201cAnyway... well done, everybody . . . you've all done a great job...\u201d \u201cSo are you back now, Lexi?\u201d demands a girl in red. \u201cNot exactly\u201d \u201cOnly I need my expenses form signed, urgently.\u201d \u201cMe too!\u201d say about six people. \u201cHave you spoken to Simon about our targets?\u201d Melanie is coming forward, frowning. \u201cOnly they're totally unworkable as they are...\u201d \u201cWhat's happening about the new computers?\u201d \u201cDid you read my e-?mail?\u201d \u201cHave we sorted the Thorne Group order?\u201d Suddenly everyone in the room seems to be swarming toward me, asking questions. I can hardly follow any of them, let alone know what they mean. \u201cI don't know!\u201d I'm saying desperately. \u201cI'm sorry, I can't remember... I'll see you later!\u201c Breathing hard, I back out across the corridor and into my own office and slam the door. Shit. What was all that about? There's a knock at the door. \u201dHello?\u201c I call out, my voice sounding strangled. \u201dHi!\u201c says Clare, coming in under a vast pile of letters and documents. \u201dSorry to bother you, Lexi, but while you're here, could you just have a quick run-?through of these? You need to get back to Tony Dukes from Biltons and authorize the payment to Sixpack and sign these waivers, and some guy called Jeremy Northpool has rung several times, says he hopes you can resume discussions...\u201d She's holding out a pen. She's expecting me to spring into action.</p><p>\u201cI can't authorize anything,\u201d I say in panic. \u201cI can't sign anything. I've never heard of Tony Dukes. I don't remember any of this stuff!\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d Clare's pile of papers drops slightly as she surveys me, wide-?eyed. \u201cWell... who's going to run the department? Byron?\u201d \u201cNo! I mean... me. It's my job. I'll do it. I just need a bit of time... Look, leave all that with me.\u201d I try to pull myself together. \u201cI'll have a read-?through. Maybe it'll come back to me.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d Clare says, clearly relieved. She dumps the pile of papers on the desk. \u201cI'll just bring your coffee through.\u201d My head spinning, I sit down at the desk and pick up the first letter. It's all about some ongoing complaint. \u201cAs you will be aware... expect your immediate response...\u201d I turn to the next document. It's a monthly budget forecast for all the departments in the company. There are six graphs and a Post-?it on which someone has scribbled: \u201cCould I get your views, Lexi?\u201d \u201cYour coffee...\u201d Clare taps on the door. \u201cAh yes,\u201d I say, summoning a bosslike tone. \u201cThank you, Clare.\u201d As she puts down the cup I nod at the graphs. \u201cVery interesting. I'll... formulate my response to them later.\u201c The minute she's gone I drop my head down on the desk in despair. What am I going to do? This job is really hard. I mean... it's really, really hard. How on earth do I do it? How do I know what to say and what decisions to make? There's yet another knocking at the door and I hastily sit bolt upright, grabbing a bit of paper at random. \u201dEverything all right, Lexi?\u201c It's Byron, holding a bottle 144 of water and a sheaf of papers. He leans against the door frame, his bony wrists protruding from his white shirt. Around one of them is an outsize high-?tech watch, which I'm sure cost a lot, but it looks ridiculous. \u201dFine! Great! I thought you were in the budget meeting.\u201c \u201dWe've broken for lunch.\u201c He has this sarcastic, drawling way of speaking, as though you're a total moron. Truth be told, I never got on with Byron. Now his eye is running over the pile of papers on my desk. \u201dBack at it already, I see.\u201c \u201dNot really.\u201c I smile, but he doesn't return it. \u201dHave you decided what to do about Tony Dukes? Because Accounts were on to me yesterday.\u201c \u201dWell...\u201c I hesitate. \u201dActually, I don't quite...I'm not...\u201c I swallow, feeling color sweep through my face. \u201dThe thing is, I've had amnesia since my accident, and...\u201c I trail off, twisting my fingers into knots. Byron's face suddenly snaps in comprehension. \u201dJesus,\u201c he says after surveying me for a moment. \u201dYou don't know who Tony Dukes is, do you?\u201c Tony Dukes. Tony Dukes. I rack my brain frantically but nothing. \u201d I . . . um... well... no. But if you could just remind me...\u201c Byron ignores me. He comes farther into the room, tapping his water bottle against his palm, his forehead creased in an appraising frown. \u201dLet me get this straight,\u201c he says slowly. \u201dYou remember absolutely nothing?\u201d All my instincts are prickling. He's like a cat prodding a mouse, working out exactly how weak its prey i s . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wants my job.</p><p>As soon as it hits me I feel like a total idiot for not having worked that one out before.

That your head will be blank forever.\u201d I meet his gaze with as much steel as I can muster. Nice try. But you're not going to freak me out that easily. \u201cI'm sure I'll be back to normal very soon,\u201d I say briskly. \u201cBack to work, running the department... I was having a great chat with Simon Johnson earlier,\u201d I throw in for good measure. \u201cUh-?huh.\u201d He taps the water bottle thoughtfully. \u201cSo... what do you want to do about Tony Dukes?\u201d Fuck. He's outmaneuvered me. There's nothing I can say about Tony Dukes, and he knows it. I shuffle the papers on my desk, playing for time. \u201cMaybe... you could make a decision on that?\u201d I say at last. \u201cI'd be happy to.\u201d He gives me a patronizing smile. \u201cI'll take care of everything. You just look after yourself, Lexi. Get yourself better, take as much time as you need. Don't worry about a thing!\u201d \u201cWell... thank you.\u201d I force a pleasant tone. \u201cI appreciate it, Byron.\u201d 146 \u201cSo!\u201d Dana appears at the door. \u201cAre you two having a nice chat? Catching up with things, Lexi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d I smile, my teeth gritted. \u201cByron's being very helpful.\u201d \u201cAnything I can do to help...\u201d He spreads his arms in a self-?deprecating gesture. \u201cI'm right here. Memory intact!\u201d \u201cSuper!\u201d Dana glances at her watch. \u201cNow, Lexi, I have to shoot off to lunch, but I can see you out if we leave now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't worry, Dana,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cI'll stay on here a bit longer and read through some paperwork.\u201d I'm not leaving this building without talking to Fi. No way.</p> <p>\u201cOkey-?doke.\u201d She beams. \u201cWell, lovely to see you, Lexi, and let's talk on the phone about when you want to return properly.\u201d She does the phone-?under-?chin gesture and I find myself copying it.</p><p>\u201cTalk soon!\u201d The two of them walk away, and I hear Byron saying, \u201cDana, may I have a word? We need to discuss this situation. With the greatest respect to Lexi...\u201d My office door shuts and I tiptoe toward it. I open it a chink and poke my head out. \u201c...she's clearly not fit to lead this department...\u201d Byron's voice is audible as he and Dana turn the corner toward the lifts. Bastard. He didn't even bother waiting until he was out of earshot. I head back into my office, slump down at the desk, and bury my head in my hands. All my euphoria has vanished. I have no idea how I ever got this job. I lift a paper at random from the heap in front of me and stare at it. It's something about insurance premiums. How do I know all this stuff, anyway? When did I learn it? I feel like I've woken up clinging to the top of Mount Everest and I don't even know what a crampon is. Heaving a huge sigh, I put the sheet down. I need to talk to someone. Fi. I lift the phone receiver and dial 352, which is her extension, unless they've changed the system. \u201cFlooring department, Fiona Roper speaking.\u201d \u201cFi, it's me!\u201d I say. \u201cLexi. Listen, can we talk?\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d Fi says in formal tones. \u201cDo you want me to come in and see you now? Or should I make an appointment with Clare?\u201c My heart sinks. She sounds s o . . . remote. \u201dI just meant we could have a chat! Unless you're busy...\u201c \u201dActually, I was about to go to lunch.\u201c \u201dWell, I'll come too!\u201c I say eagerly. \u201dLike old times! I could die for a hot chocolate. And does Morellis still do those great paninis?\u201c \u201dLexi...\u201c \u201dFi, I really need to talk to you, okay?\u201c I clutch the phone tighter. \u201dI...I don't remember anything. And it's freaking me out a bit. The whole situation.\u201c I try to laugh. \u201dJust hang on, I'll be out in a moment...\u201c I thrust down the receiver and grab a piece of paper. I hesitate, then scrawl, \u201dPlease action all these, Byron. Many thanks, Lexi.\u201c I know I'm playing right into his hands. But right now all I care about is seeing my friends. Seizing my bag and briefcase, I hurry out of my office, past Clare's desk, and into the main Flooring department. \u201dHi, Lexi,\u201c says a nearby girl. \u201dDid you want something?\u201c 148 \u201dNo, it's okay, thanks, I'm just meeting Fi for lunch...\u201c I trail off. I can't see Fi anywhere in the office. Or Carolyn. Or Debs. The girl looks surprised. \u201dI think they've already gone to lunch. You only just missed them, though...\u201c \u201dOh right.\u201c I try to hide my discomfiture. \u201dThanks. I expect they meant to meet in the lobby.\u201c I swivel on my heel, then walk as fast as I can in my spiky shoes along the corridorjust in time to see Debs disappearing into a lift. \u201dWait!\u201c I cry out, breaking into a run. \u201dI'm here! Debs!\u201d But the lift doors are already closing. She heard me. I know she did. Thoughts are spinning wildly around in my head as I shove open the door to the stairs and clatter down. They knew I was coming. Are they avoiding me? What the fuck has gone on these last three years? We're friends. Okay, I know I'm boss now... but you can be friends with your boss, can't you? Can't you? I arrive at the ground floor and almost tumble into the foyer. The first thing I see is Carolyn and Debs heading out the main glass doors, with Fi just in front of them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi!\u201d I cry out almost desperately. \u201cWait!\u201d I pelt toward the glass doors and at last catch up with them on the front steps of the building. \u201cOh, hi, Lexi.\u201d Fi gives a tiny snort that I know means she's trying not to laugh.</p><p>I suppose I do look a bit incongruous, running along redfaced in my black suit and chignon. \u201cI thought we were going to have lunch together!\u201d I say, panting. \u201cI told you I was coming!\u201d</p><p>There's silence.

Did we have a . . . a row or something?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Fi shrugs. \u201cWell, I don't understand it.\u201d I look around the faces entreatingly. \u201cLast I remember, we were best mates!

We had banana cocktails, Loser Dave stood me up, we did karaoke... remember?\u201d Fi exhales sharply and raises her eyebrows at Carolyn. \u201cThat was a long time ago.\u201d \u201cSo, what's happened since?\u201d \u201cLook.\u201d Fi sighs. \u201cLet's just leave it. You've had this accident, you're ill, we don't want to upset you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, let's just all go and get a sandwich together.\u201d Debs glances at Fi as though to say \u201cHumor her.\u201d \u201cDon't patronize me!\u201d My voice is sharper than I meant. \u201cForget about the accident! I'm not an invalid. I'm fine. But I need you to tell me the truth.\u201d I look around the group in desperation. \u201cIf we didn't have a row, what's wrong? What happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLexi, nothing happened.\u201d Fi sounds awkward. \u201cIt's 150 just... we don't really hang out with you anymore. We're not mates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why not?\u201d My heart is thudding, but I'm trying to stay calm. \u201cIs it because I'm the boss now?\u201d \u201cIt's not because you're the boss. That wouldn't matter if you were\u201d Fi breaks off. She shoves her hands in her pockets, not meeting my eye. \u201cIf I'm honest, it's because you're a bit of a...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I'm looking from face to face in bewilderment. \u201cTell me!\u201d Fi shrugs. \u201cSnotty cow.\u201d \u201cTotal bitch-?boss-?from-?hell, more like,\u201d mutters Carolyn. The air seems to freeze solid in my lungs. Bitch-?bossfrom- hell? Me?</p><p>\u201c I . . . I don't understand,\u201d I stammer at last. \u201cAren't I a good boss?\u201d \u201cOh, you're great.\u201d Carolyn's voice drips with sarcasm. \u201cYou penalize us if we're late. You time our lunch hours. You do spot checks on our expenses Oh, it's a bundle of fun in Flooring!\u201d</p><p>My cheeks are throbbing as though she'd hit me. \u201cBut I would never... That's not what I'm like\u201d Carolyn cuts me off. \u201cYeah. It is.\u201d \u201cLexi, you asked.\u201d Fi is rolling her eyes, like she always does when she's uncomfortable. \u201cThat's why we don't hang out anymore. You do your thing and we do ours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can't be a bitch,\u201d I manage at last, my voice trembling. \u201cI can't be. I'm your friend! Lexi! We have fun together, we go out dancing together, we get pissed...\u201d Tears are pricking my eyes. I look around the faces I know so wellyet kind of don'ttrying desperately to spark a chord of recognition.</p><p>\u201cI'm me! Lexi. Snaggletooth. Remember me?\u201d 151 Fi and Carolyn exchange looks. \u201cLexi...\u201d Fi says almost gently. \u201cYou're our boss. We do what you say. But we don't have lunch. And we don't go out.\u201d She hefts her bag on her shoulder, then sighs. \u201cLook, come along today if you want t o . . .\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I say, stung. \u201cIt's okay, thanks.\u201d And with shaky legs I turn and walk away.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>I'm numb with shock. All the way home from the office, I sat in my taxi in a kind of trance. Somehow I managed to talk to Gianna about the dinner party arrangements and listen to Mum when she called to complain about her latest run-?in with the council. And now it's early evening and I'm in the bath. But all the time my thoughts have been circulating around and around. I'm a bitch-?boss-?from-?hell. My friends all hate me. What the fuck has happened? Every time I remember Carolyn's scathing voice, I flinch. God knows what I've done to herbut she obviously has no time for me. Have I really turned into a bitch over the last three years? But how? Why? The water is growing tepid and at last I heave myself out. I rub myself briskly, trying to energize myself. I can't keep obsessing about it. It's already six, and in an hour I have to host a dinner party. At least I don't have to cook. When I arrived home, Gianna was busy in the kitchen with two of her niecesall singing along to the opera blaring out of the speakers. There were platters of sushi and canapes on every shelf in the fridge and the most amazing smell of roasting meat. I tried to join inI'm pretty good at garlic bread but they bustled me away. So I decided I'd be safest in the bath. I wrap a fresh towel around myself and pad into the bedroom then double back into the dressing room for my clothes. Jeez Louise. I know why rich people are so thin: it's from trekking around their humongous houses the whole time. In my Balham flat I could reach the wardrobe from the bed. And the TV. And the toaster. I pick out a little black dress, some little black underwear, and some minuscule black satin shoes. There's nothing in my 2007 wardrobe that's big. No cuddly sweaters, no chunky shoes. Everything's slimline and tailored, to match me. As I trail back into the bedroom I let my towel drop onto the floor. \u201cHi, Lexi!\u201d \u201cAargh!\u201d I jump in fright. The big screen at the base of the bed has lit up with a huge image of Eric's face. I clap my hands over my chest and duck behind a chair. I'm naked. And he can see me. He's my husband, I remind myself feverishly. He's seen it all beforeit's fine. It doesn't feel fine. \u201cEric, can you see me?\u201d I say in a high-?pitched, strangled voice. \u201cNot right now.\u201d He laughs. \u201cPut the setting to Camera.\u201d \u201cOh! Okay!\u201d I say in relief. \u201cJust give me a sec...\u201d 154 I sling on a dressing gown, then quickly start gathering the clothes I've dropped about the room. Something I've learned pretty quickly is that Eric doesn't like things lying around on the floor. Or on chairs. Or basically any kind of mess at all. I shove them all under the duvet as quickly as possible, plonk a cushion on top, and smooth it down as best I can. \u201cReady!\u201d I head to the screen and swivel the dial to Camera. \u201cMove back,\u201d Eric instructs me, and I back away from the screen. \u201cNow I can see you! So, I've got one more meeting, then I'll be on my way home. Is everything set up for dinner?\u201d \u201cI think so!\u201d \u201cExcellent.\u201d His huge pixellated mouth spreads in a jerky beam. \u201cAnd how was work?\u201d \u201cIt was great!\u201d Somehow I manage a cheerful tone. \u201cI saw Simon Johnson and all my department, and my friends...\u201d I trail off, suddenly feeling a burn of humiliation. Can I even describe them as friends anymore? \u201cMarvelous.\u201d I'm not sure Eric's even listening. \u201cNow you really should be getting ready. I'll see you later, darling.\u201d \u201cWait,\u201d I say on impulse. \u201cEric.\u201d This is my husband. I may barely know himbut he knows me. He loves me. If there's anyone I should confide in about my problems, if anyone can reassure me, it's him. \u201cFire away.\u201d Eric nods, his screen movements slow and jerky. \u201cToday, Fi said...\u201d I can hardly bring myself to say the words. \u201cShe said I was a bitch. Is that true?\u201d \u201cOf course you're not a bitch.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d I feel a pang of hope. \u201cSo I'm not a horrible bitch-?boss-?from-?hell ?\u201d \u201cDarling, there's no way you're horrible. Or a bitchboss- from-?hell.\u201d Eric sounds so sure, I relax in relief. There'll be an explanation. Maybe some wires have got crossedthere's been a misunderstanding, it'll all be fine \u201cI'd say you were... tough,\u201d he adds. My relieved smile freezes on my face. Tough? I don't like the sound of tough. \u201cDo you mean tough in a good way?\u201d I try to sound casual. \u201cLike, tough, but still really friendly and nice?\u201d \u201cSweetheart, you're focused. You're driven. You drive your department hard. You're a great boss.\u201c He smiles. \u201dNow, I must go. I'll see you later.\u201d The screen goes dark and I stare at it, totally unreassured. In fact, I'm more alarmed than ever.</p><p>Tough. Isn't that just another way of saying \"bitch-?bossfrom- helP? Whatever the truth is, I can't let all this get to me. I have to keep everything in perspective. It's an hour later, and my spirits have risen a little. I've put on my new diamond necklace. I've sprayed myself with lots of expensive scent. And I've had a sneaky little glass of wine, which has made everything look a lot better. So maybe things aren't as perfect as I thought. Maybe I've fallen out with my friends; maybe Byron is after my job; maybe I don't have a clue who Tony Dukes is. But I can put it all right. I can learn my job. I can build bridges with Fi and the others. I can google Tony Dukes. And the point is, I'm still the luckiest girl in the world. I have a gorgeous husband, a wonderful marriage, and a stunning apartment. I mean, just look around! Tonight the place looks even more jaw-?dropping than ever. The florist has been and goneand there are arrangements of lilies and roses everywhere. The dining table has been extended and laid for dinner with gleaming silverware and crystal and a centerpiece like at weddings. There are even place cards written out in calligraphy! Eric said it was a \u201ccasual little supper.\u201d God knows what we do when it's formal. Maybe have ten butlers in white gloves or something. I carefully apply my Lancome lipstick and blot it. When I've finished I can't help staring at myself in the mirror. My hair is up and my dress fits to perfection and there are diamonds at my ears and throat. I look like some elegant girl in an ad. Like any minute a caption will appear on the screen below me. Ferrero Rocher. For the finer things in life. British Gas. Keeping you warm in your million-?billionpound trendy loft apartment.</p><p>I step back and automatically the lights change from the mirror spotlight to more of an ambient glow. The \u201cintelligent lighting\u201d in this room is like magic: it figures out where you are from heat sensors and then adjusts accordingly. I quite like trying to catch it out by running around the room and shouting, \u201cHa! Not so intelligent now, are you?\u201d When Eric's out, obviously. \u201cDarling!\u201d I jump, and turn to see him standing at the door, in his business suit. \u201cYou look wonderful.\u201d \u201cThanks!\u201d I glow with pleasure and pat my hair. \u201cOne tiny thing. Briefcase in the hall. Good idea?\u201d His smile doesn't waver, but I can hear the annoyance in his voice. Shit. I must have left it there. I was so preoccupied when I arrived home, I didn't think. \u201cI'll move it,\u201d I say hastily. \u201cSorry.\u201d \u201cGood.\u201d He nods. \u201cBut first, taste this.\u201d He hands me a glass of ruby-?red wine. \u201cIt's the Chateau Branaire Ducru. We bought it on our last trip to France. I'd like your opinion.\u201d \u201cRight.\u201d I try to sound confident. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Oh no. What am I going to say? Cautiously I take a sip and swill it around my mouth, racking my brain for all the wine-?buff words I can think of. Leathery. Oaky. A fine vintage. Come to think of it, they all just bullshit, don't they? Okay, I'll say it's a divinely full-?bodied vintage with hints of strawberries. No, blackcurrants. I swallow the mouthful and nod knowledgeably at Eric. \u201cYou know, I think this is a div\u201d \u201cIt's shocking, isn't it?\u201d Eric cuts me off. \u201cCorked. Totally off.\u201d Off? \u201cOh! Er... yes!\u201d I regain my composure. \u201cWay past the sell-?by date. Urggh.\u201d I make a face. \u201cRevolting!'' That was a close shave. I put the glass down on a side table and the intelligent lighting adjusts again. \u201dEric,\u201c I say, trying not to give away my exasperation. \u201dCan we have a lighting mix that just stays the same all night? I don't know if that's possible\u201c \u201dAnything is possible.\u201c Eric sounds a bit offended. \u201dWe have infinite choice. That's what loft-?style living is all about.\u201c He passes me a remote control. \u201dHere. You can 158 override the system with this. Pick a mood. I'll go arid sort out the wine.\"</p><p>I head into the sitting room, find Lighting on the remote, and start experimenting with moods. Daylight is too bright. Cinema is too dark. Relax is dull I scroll much farther down. Reading... Disco... Hey. We have disco lights? I press the remoteand laugh out loud as the room is suddenly filled with pulsating multicolored lights. Now let's try Strobe. A moment later the room is flashing black and white and I gleefully start robotic dancing around the coffee table. This is like a club! Why didn't Eric tell me we had this before? Maybe we have dry ice, too, and a mirror ball \u201cJesus Christ, Lexi, what are you doing!\u201d Eric's voice pierces the flashing room. \u201cYou put the whole fucking apartment on Strobe Light! Gianna nearly chopped her arm off!\u201d \u201cOh no! Sorry.\u201d Guiltily I fumble for the remote and jab it until we're back on disco. \u201cYou never told me we had disco and strobe lights! This is fantastic!\u201d \u201cWe never use them.\u201d Eric's face is a multicolored whirl. \u201cNow find something sensible, for God's sake.\u201d He turns and disappears. How can we have disco lights and never use them? What a waste! I have to have Fi and the others around for a party. We'll get some wine and nibbles, and we'll clear the floor and ramp up the volume And then my heart constricts as I remember. That won't be happening anytime soon. Or maybe ever. Deflated, I switch the lighting to Reception Area One, which is as good as anything else. I put down the remote, walk over to the window, and stare out at the street below, suddenly determined. I'm not giving up. These are my friends. I'm going to find out what's been going on. And then I'm going to make up with them. My plan for the dinner party was to memorize each guest's face and name using visualization techniques. But this scheme disintegrates almost at once when three golfing buddies of Eric's arrive together in identical suits, with identical faces and even more identical wives. Their names are things like Greg and Mick and Suki and Pooky, and they immediately start discussing a skiing holiday we all apparently went on once.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sip my drink and smile a lot, and then about ten more guests arrive at once and I have no idea who anyone is except Rosalie, who dashed up, introduced her husband, Clive (who doesn't seem like a monster at all, just a mildmannered guy in a suit), and then rushed off again. After a bit my ears are ringing and I feel dizzy. Gianna is serving drinks and her niece is handing out canapes and everything seems under control. So I murmur an excuse to the balding guy who's telling me about Mick Jagger's electric guitar, which he's just bought at a charity auction, and slip away and head out to the terrace. I take a few lungfuls of clean air, my head still spinning. A blue-?gray dusk is falling and the streetlamps are just coming on. As I gaze out over London I don't feel real. I feel like someone playing the part of a girl in a dress standing on a posh balcony with a glass of champagne in her hand. \u201cDarling! There you are!\u201d I turn to see Eric pushing the sliding doors open. \u201cHi!\u201d I call back. \u201cI was just getting some air.\u201d \u201cLet me introduce Jon, my architect.\u201d Eric ushers out a dark-?haired man in black jeans and a charcoal linen jacket. 160 \u201cHello,\u201d I begin automatically, then stop. \u201cHey, we know each other!\u201d I exclaim, relieved to have found a familiar face. \u201cDon't we? You're the guy from the car.\u201d An odd expression flickers across the man's face. Almost like disappointment. Then he nods. \u201cThat's right. I'm the guy from the car.\u201d \u201cJon's our creative spirit,\u201d says Eric, slapping him on the back. \u201cHe's the talent. I may have the financial sense, but this is the man who brings the world\u201dhe pauses momentously\u201c loft-?style living.\u201d As he says the words, he does the parallel-?hands-?sweeping-?bricks gesture again.</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d I try to sound enthused. I know it's Eric's business and everything, but that phrase \u201cloft-?style living\u201d is really starting to bug me. \u201cThanks again for the other day.\u201d I smile politely at Jon. \u201cYou really saved my life!\u201d I turn to Eric. \u201cI didn't tell you, darling, but I tried to drive the car and nearly hit the wall. Jon helped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my pleasure.\u201d Jon takes a sip of his drink. \u201cSo, you still don't remember anything?\u201d \u201cNothing.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cThat must be strange for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt i s . . . but I'm getting used to it. And Eric's really helpful. He's made me this book to help me remember. It's like a marriage manual. With sections and everything.\u201d \u201cA manual?\u201d Jon echoes, and his nose starts twitching. \u201cYou're serious. A manual.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, a manual.\u201d I stare at him suspiciously. \u201cAh, there's Graham.\u201d Eric isn't even listening to the conversation. \u201cI must just have a word. Excuse me.\u201d He heads off inside, leaving me and Jon the architect guy alone. I don't know what it is about this man. I mean, I don't even know him, but he rankles me.</p><p>\u201cWhat's wrong with a marriage manual?\u201d I hear myself demanding. \u201cNo. Nothing. Nothing at all.\u201d He shakes his head gravely. \u201cIt's a very sensible move. Because otherwise you might not know when you were supposed to kiss each other.\u201d \u201cExactly! Eric's put in a whole section on\u201d I break off. Jon's mouth is crinkled up as if he's trying not to laugh. Does he think this is funny? \u201cThe manual covers all sorts of areas,\u201d I say rather stonily. \u201cAnd it's been very helpful for both of us. You know, it's difficult for Eric, too, having a wife who doesn't remember the first thing about him! Or perhaps you hadn't appreciated that?\u201d There's silence. All the humor has melted out of his face. \u201cBelieve me,\u201d he says at last. \u201cI appreciate it.\u201d He drains his glass, then stares into the bottom of it for a few moments. He looks up and seems about to speakthen, as the sliding doors open, changes his mind.</p><p>\u201cLexi!\u201d Rosalie comes tottering over toward us, glass in hand. \u201cWonderfulcanapes!\u201d \u201cOh, well... thanks!\u201d I say, embarrassed to be receiving praise for something I had absolutely nothing to do with. \u201cI haven't had any yet. Do they taste good?\u201d</p><p>Rosalie appears perplexed. \u201cI've no idea, sweetie. But they look marvelous. And Eric says dinner's about to begin.\u201d \u201cOh God,\u201d I say guiltily. \u201cI've just left him to it. We'd better go in. D'you two know each other?\u201d I add as we start walking in.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d says Jon. \u201cJon and I are old friends,\u201d Rosalie says sweetly. \u201cAren't we, darling?\u201d \u201cSee you.\u201d Jon nods, picks up his pace, and disappears through the glass doors. 162 \u201cAwful man.\u201d Rosalie makes a face at his departing back. \u201cAwful?\u201d I echo in surprise. \u201cEric seems to like him.\u201d \u201cOh, Eric likes him,\u201d she says disdainfully. \u201cAnd Clive thinks he's the bees' knees. He's visionary and wins prizes, blah blah blah...\u201d She tosses her head. \u201cBut he's the rudest man I ever met. When I asked him to donate to my charity last year, he refused. In fact, he laughed.\u201d \u201cHe laughed?\u201d I say, shocked. \u201cThat's terrible! What was the charity?\u201d \u201cIt was called An Apple a Day,\u201d she says proudly. \u201cI thought the whole idea up myself. The idea was, once a year we'd give an apple to every schoolchild in an inner-?city borough. Full of lovely nutrients! Isn't that so simple, it's brilliant?\u201d \u201cEr...great idea,\u201d I say cautiously. \u201cSo, did it work out?\u201d \u201cWell, it started off well,\u201d Rosalie says rather crossly. \u201cWe gave out thousands of apples and we had special T-?shirts and a van with an apple logo to drive about in. It was such fun! Until the council started sending us stupid letters about fruit being abandoned in the street and causing vermin.\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh dear.\u201d I bite my lip.

I'm totally freaked. As I find my place at the long glass dining table, nodding and smiling as people greet me, I feel like I'm in some weird dream. These people are allegedly my friends. They all know me. And I've never even seen them before. \u201cLexi, darling.\u201d A dark woman draws me aside as I'm approaching my chair. \u201cCan I have a quick word?\u201d She lowers her voice almost to a whisper. \u201cI was with you all day on the fifteenth and the twenty-?first, okay?\u201d \u201cWere you?\u201d I say blankly. \u201cYes. If Christian asks. Christian, my husband?\u201d She gestures at the balding Mick-?Jagger-?guitar guy, who's taking his seat opposite. \u201cOh, right.\u201d I digest this for a moment. \u201cWere we really together?\u201d \u201cOf course!\u201d she says after a brief pause. \u201cOf course we were, darling!\u201d She squeezes my hand and moves away. \u201cLadies and gentlemen.\u201d Eric is standing at the other end of the gleaming table, and the chatter dies to a hush as everyone sits down. \u201cWelcome to our home. Lexi and I are delighted you could make it.\u201d All eyes swivel to me, and I give an embarrassed smile. \u201cAs you know, Lexi is suffering the aftereffects of her recent accident, which means her memory's not too hot.\u201d Eric gives a rueful smile. A man opposite laughs, then is shushed by his wife. \u201cSo what I propose is that each of you reintroduce yourselves to Lexi. Stand up, give 164 your name, and maybe some memorable event that links you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo the doctors think this will trigger Lexi's memory?\u201d asks an earnest-?looking guy to my right. \u201cNo one knows,\u201d Eric says gravely. \u201cBut we have to try. So... who wants to start?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe! I'll start!\u201d Rosalie says, leaping to her feet. \u201cLexi, I'm your best friend, Rosalie, which you already know. And our memorable incident was that time we both got waxed and the girl got a bit carried away...\u201d She breaks into a giggle. \u201cYour face...\u201d \u201cWhat happened?\u201d says a girl in black. \u201cI'm not saying in public!\u201d Rosalie looks offended. \u201cBut honestly, it was totally memorable.\u201d She beams around the table, then sits down. \u201cRight,\u201d says Eric, sounding a bit taken aback. \u201cWho's next? Charlie?\u201d \u201cI'm Charlie Mancroft.\u201d A gruff man next to Rosalie stands up and nods at me. \u201cI suppose our memorable incident would be the time we were all at Wentworth for that corporate do. Montgomerie made a birdie on the eighteenth. Stunning play.\u201d He looks at me expectantly. \u201cOf course!\u201d I have no idea what he's talking about. Golf? Or snooker, maybe. \u201cEr... thanks.\u201d He sits down and a thin girl next to him gets to her feet. \u201cHi, Lexi.\u201d She gives me a little wave. \u201cI'm Natalie. And my most memorable event would be your wedding day.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d I say, surprised and touched. \u201cWow.\u201d \u201cIt was such a happy day!\u201d She bites her lip. \u201cAnd you looked so beautiful and I thought, 'That's what I want to look like when I get married.' I actually thought Matthew would propose to me that day, but... he didn't.\u201d Her smile tightens.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Natalie,\u201d mutters a guy across the table. \u201cNot this again.\u201d \u201cNo! It's fine!\u201d she exclaims brightly. \u201cWe're engaged now! It only took three years!\u201c She flashes her diamond at me. \u201dI'm having your dress! Exactly the same Vera Wang, in white\u201c \u201dWell done, Natalie!\u201c Eric chimes in heartily. \u201dI think we should move on Jon? Your turn.\u201d</p><p>Across the table from me, Jon gets to his feet. \u201cHi,\u201d he says in his dry voice. \u201cI'm Jon. We met earlier.\u201d He lapses into silence. \u201cSo, Jon?\u201d prompts Eric. \u201cWhat's your memorable event involving Lexi?\u201d Jon surveys me for a moment with those dark, intense eyes, and I find myself wondering what he's going to say. He scratches his neck, frowns, and takes a slug of wine, as though thinking hard. At last he spreads his arms. \u201cNothing comes to mind.\u201d \u201cNothing?\u201d I'm slightly stung, despite myself. \u201cAnything at all!\u201d Eric says encouragingly. \u201cJust some special moment the two of you shared...\u201d Everyone is watching Jon. He frowns again, then shrugs, apparently stumped. \u201cI don't recall anything,\u201d he says at last. \u201cNothing I could describe.\u201d \u201cThere must be something, Jon,\u201d a girl opposite says eagerly. \u201cIt could trigger her memory!\u201d \u201cI doubt it.\u201d He gives a brief half-?smile. \u201cWell, all right,\u201d says Eric, sounding a bit impatient. \u201cIt doesn't matter. Let's move on.\u201d By the time everyone around the table has stood up and recounted their anecdote, I've forgotten who the first people were. But it's a start, I suppose. Gianna and her helper 166 serve tuna carpaccio, arugula salad, and baked pears, and I talk to someone called Ralph about his divorce settlement. And then the plates are cleared, and Gianna is making her way around the table, taking coffee orders. \u201cI'll make the coffee,\u201d I say, jumping up. \u201cYou've done so much tonight, Gianna. Have a break.\u201d I've grown increasingly uncomfortable seeing her and her niece scurrying around the table with heavy plates. And the way no one even looks at them as they take their food. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And the way that awful man Charlie barked at her when he wanted some more water. It's so rude. \u201cLexi!\u201d Eric says with a laugh. \u201cThat's hardly necessary.\u201d \u201cI want to,\u201d I say stubbornly. \u201cGianna, sit down. Have a biscuit or something. I can easily make a few cups of coffee. Really, I insist.\u201d</p><p>Gianna looks perplexed. \u201cI'll go and turn down your bed,\u201d she says at last, and heads off toward the bedroom, her niece in her wake. That's not exactly what I meant by having a break. But anyway. \u201cThere.\u201d I smile around the table. \u201cNow, who would like coffee? Hands u p . . . \u201d I start counting the hands. \u201cAnd anyone for mint tea?\u201d \u201cI'll help,\u201d Jon says suddenly, pushing his chair back. \u201cOh,\u201d I say, taken aback. \u201cWell... okay. Thanks.\u201d I head into the kitchen, fill the kettle, and switch it on. Then I start looking in cupboards for cups. Maybe we have some special posh coffee cups for dinner parties. I briefly consult the marriage manual, but can't find anything. Meanwhile Jon is just pacing around the kitchen, his face screwed up as though in some distant daydream, not helping at all.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I say at last, with a flash of irritation. \u201cI don't suppose you know where the coffee cups are, do you?\u201d Jon doesn't even seem to hear the question. \u201cHello?\u201d I wave at him. \u201cAren't you supposed to be helping?\u201d At last he stops pacing and regards me, an even stranger expression on his face. \u201cI don't know how to tell you this,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I'm just going to tell you.\u201d He takes a breaththen he seems to change his mind and comes over close, studying my face. \u201cYou really don't remember? This isn't some kind of game you're playing with me?\u201d \u201cRemember what?\u201d I say, totally bewildered. \u201cOkay, okay.\u201d He turns and resumes pacing, thrusting his hands through his dark hair, leaving it spiky on top.</p><p>At last he turns to face me again. \u201cHere's the thing. I love you.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d I look at him in confusion. \u201cAnd you love me,\u201d he continues, without giving me time to say anything more. \u201cWe're lovers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSweetie!\u201d The door bursts open and Rosalie's face appears. \u201cTwo more orders for mint tea and a decaf for Clive.\u201d \u201cComing up!\u201d I say, my voice sounding strangled.</p><p>Rosalie disappears and the kitchen door swings shut. There's silence between us, the most prickling silence I've ever known. I can't move or speak. My eyes keep flicking ludicrously to the marriage manual still lying on the counter, as though the answer might be in there. Jon follows my gaze. \u201cI'm guessing,\u201d he says in a dry, confidential tone, \u201cthat I'm not in the manual.\u201d 168 Okay. I have to get a grip. \u201cI...don't understand,\u201d I say, trying to summon some composure. \u201cWhat do you mean, lovers? You're trying to tell me we've been having an affair?\u201d \u201cWe've been seeing each other for eight months.\u201d His dark gaze is fixed on me. \u201cYou're planning to leave Eric forme.\u201d I can't stop a gurgle of laughter. At once I clap my hand over my mouth. \u201cI'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude, but... leave Eric? For you?\u201d Before Jon can react, the door opens again. \u201cHi, Lexi!\u201d A red-?faced man comes in. \u201cCan I grab some more sparkling water?\u201d \u201cHere.\u201d I thrust two bottles into his arms. The door closes again and Jon shoves his hands in his pockets. \u201cYou were about to tell Eric you couldn't be with him anymore,\u201d he says, speaking faster. \u201cYou were about to leave him. We'd made plans \u201d He breaks off and exhales. \u201cThen you had the accident.\u201d His face is deadly serious. He really means all this. \u201cBut... that's ludicrous!\u201d For an instant Jon looks like I've hit him. \u201cLudicrous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ludicrous! I'm not the unfaithful type. Plus, I have a great marriage, a fantastic husband, I'm happy\u201d \u201cYou're not happy with Eric.\u201d Jon interrupts me. \u201cBelieve me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I'm happy with Eric!\u201d I say in astonishment. \u201cHe's lovely! He's perfect!\u201d \u201cPerfect?\u201d Jon looks as if he's trying to stop himself from going further. \u201cLexi, he's not perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, near enough,\u201d I retort, suddenly rattled. Who does this guy think he is, interrupting my dinner party to say he's my lover? \u201cListen, Jon... whoever you are. I don't believe you. I would never have an affair, okay? I have the dream marriage. I have the dream life!\u201c \u201dThe dream life?\u201c Jon rubs his forehead as though trying to gather his thoughts. \u201dThat's what you think?\u201c Something about this guy is getting under my skin. \u201dOf course!\u201c I swing my arms around the kitchen. \u201dLook at this place! Look at Eric! It's all fantastic! Why would I throw it all away on some\u201c I break off abruptly as the kitchen door swings open. \u201dSweetheart.\u201c Eric beams at me from the doorway. \u201dHow are those coffees going?\u201c \u201dThey're... on their way,\u201c I say, flustered. \u201dSorry, darling.\u201c I turn away to hide the blood pumping through my cheeks, and start spooning coffee messily into the cafetiere. I just want this man to leave. \u201dEric, I'm afraid I have to go,\u201c Jon says behind me, as though reading my mind. \u201dThanks for a great evening.\u201c \u201dJon! Good man.\u201c I can hear Eric clapping Jon on the back. \u201dWe should hook up tomorrow, talk about the planning meeting.\u201c \u201dLet's do it,\u201c Jon replies. \u201dGood-?bye, Lexi. Nice to make your acquaintance again.\u201c \u201dGood-?bye, Jon.\u201c Somehow I force myself to turn and present a hostessy smile. \u201dLovely to see you.\u201c He bends forward and kisses me lightly on the cheek. \u201dYou don't know anything about your life,\u201d he murmurs in my ear, then strides out of the kitchen without looking back.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 11</p><p>It can't be true. Morning light is creeping in around the blinds and I've been awake for a while, but I haven't got out of bed. I'm gazing straight up at the ceiling, breathing evenly in and out. My theory is that if I lie still enough, maybe the maelstrom of my mind will calm down and everything will fall neatly into place. So far it's turning out to be a pretty crap theory. Every time I replay the events of yesterday I feel giddy. I thought I was coming to grips with this new life of mine. I thought it was all falling into place. But now it's like everything is slipping and sliding away. Fi says I'm a bitch-?boss-?from-?hell. Some guy says I'm his secret lover. What next? I discover I'm an FBI agent? It cannot be true. End of story. Why would I cheat on Eric? He's good-?looking and caring and a multimillionaire and knows how to drive a speedboat. Whereas Jon is scruffy. And kind of... spiky.</p><p>As for saying \u201cYou don't know anything about your life\u201cwhat a nerve! I know plenty about my life, thank you. I know where I get my hair done, I know what dessert I had at my wedding, I know how often Eric and I have sex... It's all in the manual. And anyway, how rude is that? You don't just pitch up in someone's house and say \u201dWe're lovers\u201d when they're trying to host a dinner party with their husband. You . . . you choose a different moment. You write a note. No, you don't write a note. You Anyway. Stop thinking about it. I sit up, press the button for the window blinds to retract, and run my fingers through my hair, wincing at the tangles. The screen in front of me is blank and the room is eerily silent. I still find it weird, after my drafty bedroom in Balham, to be living in such a hermetically sealed box. According to the manual we're not supposed to open the windows because it messes up the air-?conditioning system if you do. This Jon guy is probably a psycho. He probably makes a habit of targeting people with amnesia and telling them he's their lover. There's no evidence we're having an affair. None. I haven't seen any mention of him, no scribbled notes, no photos, no mementos. But then... I'd hardly leave them around for Eric to find, would I? says a tiny voice at the back of my brain. I sit perfectly still for a moment, letting my thoughts swirl around. Then on impulse I get up and head into my clothes room. I hurry to the dressing table and wrench open the top drawer. It's full of Chanel makeup, arranged in neat rows by Gianna. I shut the drawer and pull open the next, which is full of folded scarves. The next contains a jewelry roll and a suede photo album, both empty. 172 Slowly I shut the drawer. Even here, in my very own private sanctum, everything's so tidy and sterile and kind of nothing-?y. Where's the mess? Where's the stuff? Where's the letters and the photos? Where's all my studded belts and free lipsticks off crappy magazines? Where's... me? I lean forward on my elbows, chewing my nail for a moment. Then inspiration hits me. Underwear drawer. If I was going to hide anything, it would be there. I open the wardrobe and pull open my knicker drawer. I reach down among the satiny sea of La Perlabut I can't feel anything. Nor in my bra drawer... \u201cLooking for something?\u201d Eric's voice makes me jump. I turn my head to see him standing at the door, watching me search, and at once my cheeks stain pink. He knows. No, he doesn't. Don't be stupid. There's nothing to know. \u201cHi, Eric!\u201d I withdraw my hands from the cupboard as nonchalantly as I can. \u201cI just thought I'd look for... some bras!\u201d Okay, this is the main reason why I can't be having an affair. I'm the most crap liar in the world. Why would I need \u201csome bras\u201d? Do I suddenly have six boobs? \u201cActually, I was wondering,\u201d I continue hastily. \u201cIs there any more of my stuff anywhere?\u201d \u201cStuff?\u201d Eric wrinkles his brow. \u201cLetters, diaries, that kind of thing?\u201d \u201cThere's your desk in the office. That's where you keep all your work files.\u201d \u201cOf course.\u201d I'd forgotten about the office. Or rather, I thought it was more Eric's domain than mine. \u201cIt was a marvelous evening last night, I thought.\u201d Eric comes a couple of steps into the room. \u201cBravo, darling. Can't have been easy for you.\u201d \u201cIt was good fun.\u201d I sit back on my haunches, fiddling with my watch strap. \u201cThere were some... interesting people there.\u201d \u201cYou weren't too overwhelmed?\u201d \u201cA little.\u201d I shoot him a bright smile. \u201cThere's still so much to learn.\u201d \u201cWell, you know you can ask me anything about your life. That's what I'm here for.\u201d Eric spreads his arms. \u201cIs there anything particular on your mind?\u201d I stare back at him for a moment, speechless. Have I been shagging your architect, do you happen to know?</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cSince you ask, I was just wondering. We are happy together, aren't we? We do have a happy... faithful... marriage?\u201d I'm thinking I dropped in faithful quite subtly there, but Eric's keen ears pick it up straightaway. \u201cFaithful?\u201d He frowns. \u201cLexi, I've never been unfaithful to you. I would never think of being unfaithful to you. We made vows. We made a commitment.\u201d \u201cOf course!\u201d I exclaim quickly. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d \u201cI can't even imagine how such an idea came to you.\u201d He looks quite shocked. \u201cHas someone been saying otherwise? One of our guests? Because whoever it was\u201d \u201cNo! No one said anything! I just... everything's still so new and strange.\u201d I'm floundering, my face hot. \u201cI just... thought I'd ask. Just out of interest.\u201d Okay, so we don't have some open, groovy marriage. Just in case I needed that point clarified. I shut the bra drawer, open another at random, and stare 174 at three rows of rolled-?up tights, my mind whirling. I should move away from this whole subject area. But I can't help it, I have to probe. \u201cSo, um, that guy...\u201d I wrinkle my brow artificially as though I can't remember his name. \u201cThe architect guy.\u201d \u201cJon.\u201d \u201cJon. Of course. He seems like a pretty good guy.\u201d I shrug, trying to appear as casual as possible. \u201cOh, one of the best,\u201d says Eric firmly. \u201cHe's been a massive part of our success. That guy has more imagination than anyone I know.\u201d \u201cImagination?\u201d I seize on this with slight hope. \u201cSo is he maybe overimaginative sometimes? Like... a bit of a fantasist?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Eric seems puzzled. \u201cNot at all. He's my righthand man. You'd trust Jon with your life.\u201d To my relief, the phone suddenly gives a shrill ring, before Eric can ask why I'm so interested in Jon. Eric disappears into the bedroom to answer it and I shut the tights drawer. I'm about to give up on searching in my cupboard when suddenly I see something I never noticed before. A concealed drawer, at the base of the unit, with a tiny keypad located to the right. I have a secret drawer? My heart starts to thump. Slowly I reach down and punch in the PIN number I've always used4591. There's a tiny clickand the drawer opens. Glancing at the door to make sure Eric isn't there, I gingerly stretch out my hand and clasp my hand around something hard, like the handle of a . . . It's a whip. For a moment I'm too gobsmacked to move. It's a little whip, with strands of black leather, like something straight out of a bondage shop. I'm totally transfixed by the sight of it in my hand. Is this my adultery whip? Have I turned into a completely different person? Am I now a fetishist and go to S&amp;M bars to drag men around while wearing a studded corset? Suddenly I can feel eyes on me and turn to see Eric leaning in the doorway. His gaze falls on the whip and he raises his eyebrows quizzically. \u201cOh!\u201d I say, starting in panic. \u201cI just...I found that here! I didn't know...\u201d \u201cYou'd better not leave that around for Gianna to find.\u201d He sounds amused. I stare back, my befuddled brain working overtime. Eric knows about the whip. He's smiling. That, therefore, would mean... No. Way. No way no way no way. \u201cThis wasn't in the manual, Eric!\u201d I'm aiming to sound light and jokey, but my voice is shrill. \u201cNot everything's in the manual.\u201d His eyes twinkle. Okay, this is changing the rules. I thought everything was supposed to be in the manual. I glance at the whip nervously. So... what happens? Do I whip him? Or does he No. I can't think about it anymore. I shove it back in the drawer and bang it shut, my hands sweaty. \u201cThat's right.\u201d Eric gives me a tiny wink. \u201cKeep it safe. See you later.\u201d He heads out and a few moments later I hear the front door bang.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I think I might need a small vodka. In the end I settle for a cup of coffee and two biscuits Gianna gives me from her private stash. God, I've missed 176 biscuits. And bread. And toast. I could die for some toast, all chewy and golden, slathered in butter... Anyway, stop fantasizing about carbs. And stop thinking about the whip. One teeny whip. So what? Mum's coming over to visit at eleven, and I have nothing to do till then. I wander into the sitting room, sit down on the arm of the immaculate sofa, and open a magazine. After two minutes I close it again. I'm too edgy to read. It's as if tiny cracks are appearing in my perfect life. I don't know what to believe. I don't know what to do. I put down my coffee cup and stare at my immaculate nails. I was a normal girl with frizzy hair and snaggle teeth and a crap boyfriend. And a fairly crap job, and friends who I had a laugh with, and a cozy little flat. And now... I still do a double take whenever I catch my reflection in the mirror. I don't see my personality reflected anywhere in this apartment. The TV show...the high heels... my friends refusing to hang out with me... a guy saying he's my secret lover... I just don't know who I've turned into. I don't get what the fuck's happened to me. On impulse I head into the office. There's my desk, all spick-?and-?span with the chair pushed under tidily. I've never owned a desk that looked like that in my life; no wonder I didn't realize it was mine. I sit down and open the first drawer. It's full of letters, tidily clipped together in plastic files. The second is full of bank statements, threaded onto a piece of blue string. Jeez Louise. Since when did I become so anal? I open the last, biggest drawer, expecting to find neatly stacked bottles of Wite-?Out or somethingbut it's empty except for two scraps of paper. I pull the bank statements out of the other drawer and flick through them, my eyes widening as I clock my monthly salary, which is at least three times what I used to earn. Most of my money seems to be going out of my single account into the joint account I hold with Eric, except one big sum every month, going to something called \u201cUnito Ace.\u201d I'll have to find out what that is.</p><p>I put the bank statements away and reach into the bottom drawer for the scraps of paper. One is covered in my own handwritingbut so abbreviated I can't make anything out. It's almost in code. The other is torn out of a foolscap pad and has my writing scrawled across it, only three words in pencil. I just wish I stare at it, riveted. What? What did I wish?</p><p>As I turn the scrap over in my fingers I try to imagine myself writing those words. I even trythough I know it's pointlessto remember myself writing them. Was it a year ago? Six months? Three weeks? What was I talking about? The buzzer rings, interrupting my thoughts. I fold the scrap of paper carefully and put it in my pocket. Then I bang the empty drawer shut and head out. Mum has brought three of the dogs along with her. Three huge, energetic whippets. To an immaculate apartment full of immaculate things.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mum!\u201d I take her tatty quilted jacket and try to kiss her as two of the dogs slip out of her grasp and bound toward the sofa. \u201cWow. You brought... dogs!\u201d \u201cThe poor things looked so lonely as I was leaving.\u201d She embraces one of them, rubbing her cheek against its face. \u201cAgnes is feeling rather vulnerable at the moment.\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d I say, trying to sound sympathetic. \u201cPoor old Agnes. Could she maybe go in the car?\u201d \u201cDarling, I can't just abandon her!\u201d Mum raises her eyes with a martyred air. \u201cYou know, it wasn't easy organizing this trip to London.\u201d Oh for God's sake. I knew she didn't really want to come today. This whole visit arose out of cross-?purposes. All I said on the phone was that I felt a bit weird being surrounded by strangers, and the next thing Mum was getting all defensive and saying of course she was planning to visit.</p> <p>And we ended up making this arrangement. To my horror I notice a dog putting its paws up on the glass coffee table, while the other is on the sofa grabbing a cushion in its jaws. Jesus. If the sofa's worth ten grand, then that cushion is probably worth about a thousand quid on its own. \u201cMum... could you possibly get that dog off the sofa?\u201d \u201cRaphael won't do any harm!\u201d says Mum, looking hurt. She lets go of Agnes, who bounces over to join Raphael and whatever the other one is called. There are now three whippets romping joyfully on Eric's sofa. He'd better not turn on the cameras. \u201cHave you got any diet Coke?\u201d Amy has sauntered in behind Mum, hands in her pockets. \u201cIn the kitchen, I think,\u201d I say distractedly, holding out my hand. \u201cHere, dogs! Off the sofa!\u201d All three dogs ignore me. \u201cCome here, darlings!\u201d Mum produces some dog biscuits out of her cardigan pockets, and the dogs magically stop chewing the upholstery. One sits at her feet and the other two snuggle up beside her, resting their heads on her faded print skirt. \u201cThere,\u201d says Mum. \u201cNo harm done.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I look at the mangled cushion that Raphael has just dropped. It's really not worth saying anything. \u201cThere's no diet Coke.\u201d Amy reappears from the kitchen, unwrapping a Chupa Chups lollipop, her legs endless in white skinny jeans tucked into boots. \u201cHave you got any Sprite?\u201d \u201cWe might have...\u201d I look at her, suddenly distracted. \u201cShouldn't you be at school?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Amy pops the lolly in her mouth with a defiant shrug. \u201cWhy not?\u201d I look from her to Mum, sensing a sudden tension in the air. No one answers immediately. Mum is adjusting her velvet Alice band on her hair, her eyes distant, as though positioning it just right is her absolute priority. \u201cAmy's in a teeny bit of trouble,\u201d she says at last. \u201cIsn't she, Raphael?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI've been suspended from school.\u201d With a swagger, Amy heads over to a chair, sits down, and puts her feet up on the coffee table. \u201cSuspended? Why?\u201d There's silence. Mum doesn't appear to have heard me. \u201cMum, why?\u201d \u201cI'm afraid Amy's been up to her old tricks again,\u201d Mum says with a little wince. \u201cOld tricks?\u201d The only tricks I can ever remember Amy doing are card tricks from a magic set she once got in her Christmas stocking. I can see her now, in her pink gingham pajamas and bunny slippers in front of the fireplace, asking us to pick a card while we all pretended not to notice the one she had hidden up her sleeve. I feel a pang of nostalgia. She was such a sweet little thing. 180 \u201cWhat did you do, Ame?\u201d \u201cIt was nothing! They so totally overreacted.\u201d Amy takes her lolly out of her mouth and sighs with exaggerated patience. \u201cAll I did was bring this psychic into school.\u201d \u201cA psychic?\u201d \u201cWell.\u201d Amy meets my eye with a smirk. \u201cThis woman I met in a club. I don't know exactly how psychic she is. But everyone believed us. I charged ten quid each and she told all the girls they'd meet a boy tomorrow. Everyone was happy. Until some teacher found out.\u201d \u201cTen quid each?\u201d I stare at her in disbelief. \u201cNo wonder you got in trouble!\u201d \u201cI'm on my final warning,\u201d she says proudly. \u201cWhy? Amy, what else have you done?\u201d \u201cNothing much! Just...over the holidays I collected money for this math teacher, Mrs. Winters, who was in the hospital.\u201d Amy shrugs. \u201cI said she was on the way out and everyone gave loads. I raised over five hundred quid.\u201d She snuffles with laughter. \u201cIt was so cool!\u201d \u201cDarling, it's extorting money under false pretenses.\u201d Mum's twisting her amber beads obsessively with one hand, while stroking one of the dogs with the other. \"Mrs.</p><p>Winters was very upset.\u201c \u201dI gave her some chocolates, didn't I?\u201c retorts Amy, unrepentant. \u201dAnd anyway, I wasn't lying. You could die from liposuction.\u201c I'm trying to find something to say, but I'm too gobsmacked. How did my sister turn from cute, innocent little Amy into... this? \u201dI need some lip salve,\u201c Amy says, swinging her legs down off the sofa. \u201dCan I get some off your dressing table?\u201c \u201dUm, sure.\u201c As soon as she's out of the room I turn to Mum. \u201cWhat's going on? How long has Amy been getting into trouble?\u201d \u201cOh... for the last couple of years.\u201d Mum doesn't look at me and instead addresses the dog on her lap. \u201cShe's a good, sweet girl, really, isn't she, Agnes? She just gets led astray. Some older girls encouraged her into the stealing; that really wasn't her fault \u201d \u201cStealing?\u201d I echo in horror. \u201cYes. Well.\u201d Mum looks pained. \u201cIt was an unfortunate incident. She took a jacket from a fellow pupil and sewed her own name-?tape into the back. But she really was very repentant.\u201d \u201cBut... why?\u201d \u201cDarling, nobody knows. She took her father's death quite badly and ever since then... it's been one thing after another.\u201d I don't know what to say to that. Maybe all teens who lose their fathers go off the rails for a bit. \u201cThat reminds me. I've got something for you, Lexi.\u201d Mum reaches into her canvas bag and produces a DVD in a plain plastic case. \u201cThis is the last message from your father. He did a farewell recording before the operation, just in case. It was played at the funeral. If you don't remember it, you should probably see it.\u201d She hands it over with two fingers as though it's contaminated. I take the DVD and stare at it. The last surviving message from Dad. I still can't quite believe he's been dead for over three years. \u201cIt'll be like seeing him again.\u201d I turn the disc over in my hands. \u201cHow amazing that he did a recording.\u201d \u201cYes. Well.\u201d Mum's got that twitchy look again. \u201cYou know your father. Always had to be the center of attention.\u201d 182 \u201cMum! It's fair enough to be the center of attention at your own funeral.\u201d Again Mum appears not to have heard. That's always her trick whenever anyone starts talking about a topic she doesn't like. She just blanks the whole conversation and changes the subject. Sure enough, a moment later she looks up and says, \u201cMaybe you could help Amy, darling. You were going to find her an internship at your office.\u201d \u201cAn internship?\u201d I frown doubtfully. \u201cMum, I'm not sure about that.\u201d My work situation is complicated enough right now without Amy flouncing around the place. \u201cJust for a week or two. You said you'd spoken to the right people about it and it was all set up\u201d \u201cMaybe I did.\u201d I cut her off hastily. \u201cBut everything's different now. I'm not even back at work yet. I need to relearn my job\u201d \u201cYou've done so well in your career,\u201d says Mum persuasively. Yup, I've done great. From junior sales manager to bitchboss- from-?hell, in one seamless leap. There's silence for a few moments, apart from the sound of dogs skittering in the kitchen. I dread to think what they're doing. \u201cMum, I was wondering about that,\u201d I say. \u201cI'm trying to put all the pieces of my life together... and it doesn't make sense. Why did I go on that TV show? Why did I become all hard and ambitious overnight? I don't get it.\u201d \u201cI have no idea.\u201d Mum seems preoccupied, searching in her bag for something. \u201cNatural career advancement.\u201d \u201cBut it wasn't natural.\u201d I lean forward, trying to get her attention. \u201cI was never a high-?powered career woman you know I wasn't. Why would I suddenly change?\u201d \u201dDarling, it was all so long ago, I really can't remember. . . . Aren't you a good girl? Aren't you the most beautiful girl in the world?\u201c She's addressing one of the dogs, I suddenly realize. She isn't even listening to me. Typical. I look up to see Amy coming back into the room, still sucking her lollipop. \u201dAmy, Lexi was just talking about you doing an internship at her office!\u201c Mum says brightly. \u201dWould you like that?\u201c \u201dMaybe,\u201c I put in quickly. \u201dWhen I've been back at work for a while.\u201c \u201dYeah. S'pose.\u201c She doesn't even look grateful. \u201dThere'd have to be some ground rules,\u201c I say. \u201dYou can't rip off my colleagues. Or steal from them.\u201c \u201dI don't steal!\u201c Amy looks stung. \u201dIt was one jacket, and there was a mix-?up. Jesus\u201c \u201dSweetheart, it wasn't just the jacket, was it?\u201c says Mum, after a pause. \u201dIt was the makeup, too.\u201c \u201dEveryone thinks the worst of me. Every time anything goes missing, I'm the scapegoat.\u201c Amy's eyes are glittering in her pale face. She hunches her thin shoulders and suddenly I feel bad. She's right. I've judged her without even knowing the facts. \u201dI'm sorry,\u201c I say awkwardly. \u201dI'm sure you don't steal.\u201c \u201dWhatever.\u201c Her face is averted. \u201dJust blame me for everything, like everyone else.\u201c \u201dNo. I won't.\u201c I head over to where she's standing by the window. \u201dAmy, I really want to apologize. I know things 184 have been hard for you since Dad died Come here.\u201c I hold my arms out for a hug. \u201dLeave me alone,\u201c she says almost savagely. \u201dBut Amy\u201c \u201dGo away!\u201c She backs away urgently, raising her arms as though to fend me off. \u201dBut you're my little sister!\u201c I lean forward and give her a tight hugthen draw back almost immediately, rubbing my ribs. \u201d Ow! What the hell... You're all lumpy!\u201c \u201dNo, I'm not,\u201c Amy says after a fraction of a beat. \u201dYes, you are!\u201c I peer at her bulky denim jacket. \u201dWhat on earth have you got in your pockets?\u201c \u201dTins of food,\u201c says Amy seamlessly. \u201dTuna and sweet corn.\u201c \u201dSweet corn?\u201c I stare at her, baffled. \u201dNot again.\u201c Mum shuts her eyes. \u201dAmy, what have you taken from Lexi?\u201c \u201dGive me a break!\u201c Amy yells. \u201dI haven't taken anything!\u201c She throws her hand up in a defensive motion and two Chanel lipsticks fly out of the sleeve of her jacket, followed by a powder compact. They land on the floor with a clatter and we all stare at them. \u201dAre those mine?\u201c I say at last. \u201dNo,\u201c Amy says belligerently, but she's turned pink. \u201dYes, they are!\u201c \u201dLike you'd even notice\u201c She shrugs sulkily. \u201dYou've got thousands of bloody lipsticks.\u201c \u201dOh, Amy,\u201c Mum says sorrowfully. \u201dTurn out your pockets.\" Shooting Mum a murderous glance, Amy starts unpacking her pockets, laying all the contents on the coffee table with a series of little crashes. Two unopened moisturizers. A Jo Malone candle, A load of makeup. A Christian Dior perfume gift set. I watch her in silence, goggling at her haul. \u201cNow take off your T-?shirt,\u201d Mum orders, like some kind of immigration official. \u201cThis is so unfair,\u201d mutters Amy. She struggles out of the T-?shirt and my jaw drops. Underneath, she's wearing an Armani slip dress that I recognize from my wardrobe, all scrunched up under her jeans. She has about five La Perla bras worn around her middle, and dangling from them, like charms from a bracelet, are two beaded evening bags. \u201cYou took a dress?\u201d I suppress a giggle. \u201cAnd bras?\u201d \u201cFine. You want your dress back. Fine.\u201d She peels everything off and dumps it on the table. \u201cSatisfied?\u201d She looks up and catches the expression on my face. \u201cIt's not my fault. Mum won't give me any money for clothes.\u201d \u201cAmy, that's nonsense!\u201d Mum exclaims sharply. \u201cYou have plenty of clothes!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey're all out of date!\u201d she instantly yells back at Mum, in a way that suggests they've had this argument before. \u201cWe don't all live in a bloody fashion time-?warp like you do! When are you going to realize it's the twenty-?first century?\u201d She gestures at Mum's dress. \u201cIt's tragic!\u201d \u201cAmy, stop it!\u201d I say hastily. \u201cThat's not the point. And anyway, those bras don't even fit you!\u201d \u201cYou can sell bras on eBay,\u201d she retorts scathingly. \u201cFancy overpriced bras, that is.\u201d She shoves on her T-?shirt, sinks down onto the floor, and starts texting something on her phone. I'm totally flummoxed by all of this. \u201cAmy,\u201d I say at last, \u201cmaybe we should have a little talk. Mum, why don't you go and make some coffee or something?\u201d Mum looks totally flustered, and seems grateful to head out to the kitchen. When she's gone I sit down on the floor, 186 across from where Amy has plonked herself. Her shoulders are tensed angrily and she doesn't look up. Okay. I have to be understanding and sympathetic. I know there's a big age gap between me and Amy. I know I can't even remember a whole chunk of her life. But surely we have a sisterly rapport? \u201cAmy, listen,\u201d I say in my best understanding-?grown-?upsister- but-?still-?pretty-?cool voice. \u201cYou can't steal, okay? You can't extort money from people.\u201d \u201cFuck off,\u201d Amy says without raising her head. \u201cYou'll get in trouble. You'll get chucked out of school!\u201d \u201cFuck,\u201d Amy says conversationally. \u201cOff. Fuck off, fuck off, fuck off...\u201d \u201cLook!\u201d I say, trying to keep my patience. \u201cI know things can be difficult. And you're probably lonely with just you and Mum at home. But if you ever want to talk about anything, if you've got any problems, I'm here for you. Just call me, or text me, anytime. We could go out for a coffee, or see a film together...\u201d I trail away. Amy's still texting with one hand. With the other she has slowly moved her thumb and index finger into the \u201cLoser\u201d sign. \u201cOh fuck off, yourself!\u201d I exclaim furiously, and hug my knees. Stupid little cow. If Mum thinks I'm having her in my office on some internship, she has to be joking. We sit there in grouchy silence for a bit. Then I reach for the DVD of Dad's funeral message, slide across the floor, and plug it into the machine. The huge screen opposite lights up, and after a few moments my father's face appears. I stare at the screen, gripped. Dad's sitting in an armchair, wearing a red plushy dressing gown. I don't recognize the roombut then, I never did get to see many of Dad's homes. His face is gaunt, the way I remember it after he got ill. It was as though he was slowly deflating. But his green eyes are twinkling and there's a cigar in his hand. \u201cHello,\u201d he says, his voice hoarse. \u201cIt's me. Well, you know that.\u201d He gives a little laugh, then breaks into a hacking cough, which he relieves by taking a puff on his cigar as if it was a drink of water. \u201cWe all know this operation has a fifty-?fifty chance of survival. My own fault for buggering up my body. So I thought I'd do a little message to you, my family, just in case.\u201d He pauses and takes a deep slug from a tumbler of whisky. His hand is shaking as he puts it down, I notice. Did he know he was going to die? Suddenly there's a hard lump in my throat. I glance over at Amy. She's let go of her phone and is watching, too, transfixed. \u201cLive a good life,\u201d Dad is saying to the camera. \u201cBe happy. Be kind to one another. Barbara, stop living your life through those bloody dogs. They're not human. They're never going to love you or support you or go to bed with you. Unless you're very desperate.\u201d I clap my hand over my mouth. \u201cHe didn't say that!\u201d \u201cHe did.\u201d Amy gives a little snort of laughter. \u201cMum walked out of the room.\u201d \u201cYou only get one life, loves. Don't waste it.\u201d He looks at the camera with glittering green eyes, and I suddenly remember him when I was much younger, picking me up from school in a sports car. I was pointing him out to everyone: That man there is my daddy! All the kids were gasping at the car and all the mothers were shooting surreptitious glances at him, in his smart linen jacket and Spanish tan.</p><p>\u201cI know I've fucked up here and there,\u201d Dad's saying. \u201cI know I haven't been the best family man. But hand on 188 heart, I did my best. Cheers, m'dears. See you on the other side.\u201d He raises his glass to the camera and drinks. Then the screen goes blank.</p><p>The DVD clicks off, but neither Amy nor I moves. As I gaze at the blank screen I feel even more marooned than before. My dad's dead. He's been dead three years. I can never talk to him again. I can never give him a birthday present. I can never ask him for advice. Not that you'd ask Dad's advice on anything except where to buy sexy underwear for a mistressbut still. I glance over at Amy, who meets my gaze with a tiny shrug. \u201cThat was a really nice message,\u201d I say, determined not to be sentimental or cry or anything. \u201cDad came good.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d Amy nods. \u201cHe did.\u201d The frostiness between us seems to have melted. Amy reaches in her bag for a tiny makeup case with Babe embossed on the lid in diamante. She takes out a lip pencil and expertly outlines her lips, peering into a tiny mirror. I've never seen her put on makeup before, except as a dressingup game. Amy's not a child anymore, I think as I watch her. She's on the brink of being an adult. I know things haven't gone that well between us todaybut maybe in the past she's been my friend. My confidante, even. \u201cHey, Amy,\u201d I say in a low, cautious voice. \u201cDid we talk much before the accident? The two of us, I mean. About... stuff.\u201d I glance toward the kitchen to make sure Mum can't hear. \u201cA bit.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cWhat stuff?\u201d \u201cI was just wondering.\u201d I keep my voice natural. \u201cOut of interest, did I ever mention anyone called.. .Jon?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJon?\u201d Amy pauses, lipstick in hand. \u201cYou mean the one you had sex with?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d My voice shoots out like a rocket. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>Oh my God. It's true. \u201cYeah.\u201d Amy seems surprised by my reaction. \u201cYou told me at New Year's Eve. You were quite pissed.\u201d \u201cWhat else did I tell you?\u201d My heart is thumping wildly. \u201cTell me everything you can remember.\u201d \u201cYou told me everything!\u201d Her eyes light up. \u201cAll the gory details. It was your first-?ever time, and he lost the condom, and you were freezing to death on the school field...\u201d \u201cSchool field?\u201d I stare at Amy, my mind trying to make sense of this. \u201cDo you mean... are you talking about James?\u201d \u201cOh yeah!\u201d She clicks her tongue in realization. \u201cThat's who I meant. James. The guy in the band when you were at school. Why, who are you talking about?\u201d She finishes her lipstick and regards me with fresh interest. \u201cWho's Jon?\u201d \u201cHe's no one,\u201d I say hastily. \u201cJust...some guy. He's nothing.\u201d You seethere's no evidence. If I was really having an affair I would have left a trail. A note, or a photo, or a diary entry. Or Amy would know, or something... And the point is, I'm happily married to Eric. That's the point. It's much later that evening. Mum and Amy left a while ago, after we finally managed to cajole one whippet off the 190 balcony and another out of Eric's Jacuzzi, where it was having a fight with one of the towels. And now I'm in the car with Eric, zipping along the Embankment. He's having a meeting with Ava, his interior designer, and suggested I come along and see the show flat of his latest development, Blue 42. All Eric's buildings are called \u201cBlue\u201d and then some number. It's the company's brand. It turns out that having a brand is a crucial part of selling loft-?style living, as is having the right music on when you walk in, and the right cutlery on the show table. Apparently Ava is a genius at choosing the right cutlery.</p><p>I learned about Ava from the marriage manual. She's forty-?eight, divorced, worked in LA for twenty years, has written a series of books called things like Tassel and Fork, and designs all the show homes for Eric's company. \u201cHey, Eric,\u201d I say as we drive along. \u201cI was looking at my bank statement today. I seem to pay all this regular money to something called Unito. I rang up the bank, and they said it's an offshore account.\u201c \u201dUh-?huh.\u201d Eric nods as though he's not remotely interested. I wait for him to say something else, but he turns on the radio. \u201cDon't you know anything about it?\u201d I say over the sound of the news. \u201cNo.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cNot a bad idea, though, putting some of your money offshore.\u201d \u201cRight.\u201d I'm dissatisfied by his response; I almost feel like I want to pick a fight about it. But I don't know why. \u201cI just need to get some petrol.\u201d Eric swings off the road into a BP station. \u201cI won't be a moment...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say as he opens the door. \u201cCould you get me some chips in the shop? Salt 'n' vinegar if they have them.\u201d \u201cChips?\u201d He turns back and stares at me as though I've asked for some heroin. \u201cYes, chips.\u201d \u201cDarling.\u201d Eric looks perplexed. \u201cYou don't eat chips. It was all in the manual. Our nutritionist has recommended a low-?carb, high-?protein diet.\u201d \u201cWell...I know. But everyone's allowed a little treat once in a while, aren't they? And I really feel like some chips.\u201d For a moment Eric seems lost for an answer. \u201cThe doctors warned me you might be irrational, and make odd, out-?of-?character gestures,\u201d he says, almost to himself. \u201cIt's not irrational to eat a packet of chips!\u201d I protest. \u201cThey're not poison.\u201d \u201cSweetheart... I'm thinking of you.\u201d Eric adopts a loving tone. \u201cI know how hard you've worked at reducing those two dress sizes. We invested a lot in your personal trainer. If you want to throw it away on a bag of chips, then that's your choice. Do you still want the chips?\u201c \u201dYes,\u201d I say, a bit more defiantly than I meant to.</p> <p>I see a flash of annoyance pass over Eric's face, which he manages to convert into a smile. \u201cNo problem.\u201d He shuts the car door with a heavy clunk. A few minutes later I see him walking briskly back from the garage, holding a packet of chips.</p><p>\u201cHere you are.\u201d He drops them on my lap and starts the engine. \u201cThank you!\u201d I smile gratefully, but I'm not sure he notices. As he drives off, I try to open the packetbut my left hand is still clumsy after the accident and I can't get a 192 proper grip on the plastic. At last I put the packet between my teeth, yank as hard as I can with my right hand... and the entire packet explodes.</p><p>Shit. There are chips everywhere. All over the seats, all over the gear stick, and all over Eric. \u201cJesus!\u201d He shakes his head in annoyance. \u201cAre those in my hair?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I gasp, brushing at his jacket. \u201cI'm really, really sorry...\u201d The reek of salt and vinegar has filled the car. Mmm. That's a good smell.</p><p>\u201cI'll have to have the car valeted.\u201d Eric's nose is wrinkled in distaste. \u201cAnd my jacket will be covered in grease.\u201d \u201cI'm sorry, Eric,\u201d I say again, humbly, brushing the last crumbs off his shoulder. \u201cI'll pay for the dry cleaning,\u201d I sit back, reach for a massive chip that landed on my lap, and put it in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cAre you eating that?\u201d Eric sounds like this is the last straw. \u201cIt only landed on my lap,\u201d I protest. \u201cIt's clean!\u201d We drive on awhile in silence. Surreptitiously I eat a few more chips, trying to crunch them as quietly as possible. \u201cIt's not your fault,\u201d says Eric, staring ahead at the road. \u201cYou had a bump on the head. I can't expect normality yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel perfectly normal,\u201d I say. \u201cOf course you do.\u201d He pats my hand patronizingly and I stiffen. Okay, I may not be totally recovered. But I do know that eating one packet of chips doesn't make you mentally ill. I'm about to tell that to Eric, when he signals and turns in at a pair of electric gates that has opened for us. We drive into a shallow forecourt and Eric turns off the engine.</p> <p>\u201cHere we are.\u201d I can hear the pride crackling in his voice. He gestures out the window. \u201cThis is our latest baby.\u201d I stare up, totally overcome, forgetting all about chips. In front of us is a brand-?new white building. It has curved balconies, an awning, and black granite steps up to a pair of grand silver-?framed doors. \u201cYou built this?\u201d I say at last. \u201cNot personally.\u201d Eric laughs. \u201cCome on.\u201d He opens his door, brushing the last few chips off his trousers, and I follow, still in awe. A uniformed porter opens the door for us. The foyer is all palest marble and white pillars. This place is a palace. \u201cIt's amazing. It's so glamorous!\u201d I keep noticing tiny details everywhere, like the inlaid borders and the sky-?painted ceiling. \u201cThe penthouse has its own lift.\u201d With a nod to the porter, Eric ushers me to the rear of the lobby and into a beautiful marquetry-?lined lift. \u201cThere's a pool in the basement, a gym, and a residents' cinema. Although of course most apartments have their own private gyms and cinemas as well,\u201d he adds. I look up sharply to see if he's jokingbut I don't think he is. A private gym and cinema? In a flat? \u201cAnd here we are...\u201d The lift opens with the tiniest of pings and we walk into a circular, mirrored foyer. Eric presses gently on one of the mirrors, which turns out to be a door. It swings open and I just gape. I'm looking at the most massive room. No, space. It has floor-?to-?ceiling windows, a walk-?in fireplace on one wall and on another wall there's a gigantic steel sheet down which are cascading endless streams of water.</p><p>\u201cIs that real water?\u201d I say stupidly. \u201cInside a house?\u201d Eric laughs. 194 \u201cOur customers like a statement. It's fun, huh?\u201d He picks up a remote and jabs it at the waterfalland at once the water is bathed in blue light. \u201cThere are ten pre-?programmed light shows. Ava?\u201d He raises his voice, and a moment later a skinny blond woman in rimless glasses, gray trousers, and a white shirt appears from some recessed doorway next to the waterfall.</p><p>\u201cHi there!\u201d she says in a mid-?Atlantic accent. \u201cLexi! You're up and about!\u201d She grasps my hand with both of hers. \u201cI heard all about it. You poor thing.\u201d \u201cI'm fine, really.\u201d I smile. \u201cJust piecing my life back together again.\u201d I gesture around the room. \u201cThis place is amazing! All that water...\u201c \u201dWater is the theme of the show apartment,\u201c says Eric. \u201dWe've followed feng shui principles pretty closely, haven't we, Ava? Very important for some of our ultra-?high net worths.\u201c \u201dUltra-?what?\u201c I say, confused. \u201dThe very rich,\u201c Eric translates. \u201dOur target market.\u201c \u201dFeng shui is vital for ultra-?highs.\u201c Ava nods earnestly. \u201dEric, I've just taken delivery of the fish for the master suite. They're stunning!\u201c She adds to me, \u201dEach fish is worth three hundred pounds. We hired them especially.\u201c Ultra-?high whatevers. Fish for hire. It's a different world. Lost for words, I look around again at the massive apartment: at the curved cocktail bar and the sunken seating area and the glass sculpture hanging from the ceiling. I have no idea how much this place costs. I don't want to know. \u201dHere you are.\u201c Ava hands me an intricate scale model made of paper and tiny wooden sticks. \u201dThis is the whole building. You'll notice I've mirrored the curved balconies in 195 the scalloped edges of the scatter pillows,\u201c she adds. \u201dVery art deco meets Gaultier.\u201c \u201dEr... excellent!\u201c I rack my brains for something to say about art deco meets Gaultier, and fail. \u201dSo, how did you think of it all?\u201c I gesture at the waterfall, which is now bathed in orange light. \u201dLike, how did you come up with this?\u201c \u201dOh, that wasn't me.\u201c Ava shakes her head emphatically. \u201dMy area is soft furnishings, fabrics, sensual details. The big concept stuff was all down to Jon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I feel a tiny lurch inside. \u201cJon?\u201d I tilt my head, adopting the vaguest expression I can muster, as if Jon is some unfamiliar word from an obscure foreign language. \u201cJon Blythe,\u201d Eric prompts helpfully. \u201cThe architect. You met him at the dinner party, remember? In fact, weren't you asking me about him earlier on?\u201d \u201cWas I?\u201d I say after an infinitesimal pause. \u201cI...don't really remember.\u201d I start turning over the model in my fingers, trying to ignore the slight flush rising up my neck. This is ridiculous. I'm behaving like a guilty adulterous wife. \u201cJon, there you are!\u201d Ava calls out. \u201cWe were just talking about you!\u201d He's here? My hands clench involuntarily around the model. I don't want to see him. I don't want him to see me. I have to make an excuse and leave But too late. Here he is, loping across the floor, wearing jeans and a navy V-?neck and consulting some bit of paper. Okay, stay calm. Everything's fine. You're happily married and have no evidence of any secret fling, affair, or liaison with this man. 196 \u201cHi, Eric, Lexi.\u201d He nods politely as he approaches then stares at my hands. I look down and feel a jerk of dismay. The model's totally crushed. The roof's broken and one of the balconies has become detached. \u201cLexi!\u201d Eric has just noticed it. \u201cHow on earth did that happen?\u201d \u201cJon.\u201d Ava's brow crumples in distress. \u201cYour model!\u201d \u201cI'm really sorry!\u201d I say, flustered. \u201cI don't know how it happened. I was just holding it, and somehow...\u201d \u201cDon't worry.\u201d Jon shrugs. \u201cIt only took me a month to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA month?\u201d I echo, aghast. \u201cLook, if you give me some Scotch tape I'll fix it \u201d I'm patting at the crushed roof, desperately trying to prod it back into shape. \u201cMaybe not quite a month,\u201d Jon says, watching me. \u201cMaybe a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I stop patting. \u201cWell, anyway, I'm sorry.\u201d Jon shoots me a brief glance. \u201cYou can make it up to me.\u201d Make it up to him? What does that mean? Without quite meaning to I slip my arm through Eric's. I need some reassurance. I need ballast. I need a sturdy husband by my side. \u201cSo, the apartment's very impressive, Jon.\u201d I adopt a bland, corporate-?wife-?type manner, sweeping an arm around the space. \u201cMany congratulations.\u201d \u201cThank you. I'm pleased with it,\u201d he replies in equally bland tones. \u201cHow's the memory doing?\u201d \u201cPretty much the same as before.\u201d \u201cYou haven't remembered anything new?\u201d \u201cNo. Nothing.\u201d \u201cThat's a shame.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d I'm trying to stay naturalbut there's an electric atmo 197 sphere growing between us as we face each other. My breath is coming just slightly short. I glance up at Eric, convinced he must have noticed somethingbut he hasn't even flickered. Can't he feel it? Can't he see it? \u201cEric, we need to talk about the Bayswater project,\u201d says Ava, who has been riffling through her soft leather handbag. \u201cI went to see the site yesterday and made some notes\u201d \u201cLexi, why don't you look around the apartment while Ava and I talk?\u201d Eric cuts her off, loosening his arm from mine. \u201cJon will show you.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d I stiffen. \u201cNo, don't worry.\u201d \u201cI'd be happy to show you.\u201d Jon's voice is dry and kind of bored. \u201cIf you're interested.\u201d \u201cReally, there's no need...\u201d \u201cDarling, Jon designed the whole building,\u201d Eric says reprovingly. \u201cIt's a great opportunity for you to find out the vision of the company.\u201c \u201dCome this way and I'll explain the initial concept.\u201c Jon gestures toward the other side of the room. I can't get out of this. \u201dThat would be great,\u201c I say at last. Fine. If he wants to talk, I'll talk. I follow Jon across the room and we pause next to the tumbling streams of the waterfall. How could anyone live with water thundering down the wall like this? \u201dSo,\u201c I say politely. \u201dHow do you think of all these ideas? All these 'statements' or whatever they are.\u201c Jon frowns thoughtfully and my heart sinks. I hope he's not going to come up with a load of pretentious stuff about his artistic genius. I'm really not in the mood. \u201dI just ask myself, what would a wanker like?\u201c he says at last. \u201dAnd I put it in.\u201c 198 I can't help a half-?laugh of shock. \u201dWell, if I were a wanker I'd love this.\u201c \u201dThere you go.\u201c He takes a step nearer and lowers his voice beneath the sound of the water. \u201dSo you really haven't remembered anything?\u201c \u201dNo. Nothing at all.\u201c \u201dOkay.\u201c He exhales sharply. \u201dWe have to meet. We have to talk. There's a place we go, the Old Canal House in Islington.\u201c In a much louder voice he adds, \u201dYou'll notice the high ceilings, Lexi. They're a trademark feature of all our developments.\u201c He glances over and catches my expression. \u201dWhat?\u201c \u201dAre you crazy?\u201c I hiss, glancing over to make sure Eric can't hear. \u201dI'm not meeting you! For your information, I haven't found a single piece of evidence that you and I are having an affair. Not one. What a great sense of space!\u201c I add at full volume. \u201dEvidence?\u201c Jon looks as if he doesn't understand. \u201dLike what?\u201c \u201dLike... I don't know. A love note.\u201c \u201dWe didn't write each other love notes.\u201c \u201dOr trinkets.\u201c \u201dTrinkets?\u201c Jon looks like he wants to laugh. \u201dWe weren't much into trinkets, either.\u201c \u201dWell, it couldn't have been much of a love affair, then!\u201c I retort. \u201dI've looked in my dressing tablenothing. I looked in my diarynothing. I asked my sistershe'd never even heard of you.\u201c \u201dLexi.\u201c He pauses as though working out how to explain the situation to me. \u201dIt was a secret affair. That would mean an affair that you keep secret\u201c \u201dSo you have no proof. I knew it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I turn on my heel and stride away toward the fireplace, Jon following closely behind. \u201cYou want proof?\u201d I can hear him muttering in low, incredulous tones. \u201cWhat, like... you have a strawberry mark on your left buttock?\u201d \u201cI don't\u201d I swivel around in triumph, then stop abruptly as Eric glances across the room at us. \u201cI don't know how you came up with this amazing use of light!\u201d I wave at Eric, who waves back and continues his conversation. \u201cI know you don't have a birthmark on your buttock.\u201d Jon rolls his eyes. \u201cYou don't have any birthmarks at all. Just a mole on your arm.\u201d I'm briefly silenced. He's right. But so what? \u201cThat could be a lucky guess.\u201d I fold my arms. \u201cI know. But it's not.\u201d He looks at me steadily. \u201cLexi, I'm not making it up. We're having an affair. We love each other. Deeply and passionately.\u201d \u201cLook.\u201d I thrust my hands through my hair. \u201cThis is just... mad! I wouldn't have an affair. Not with you or anyone. I've never been unfaithful to anybody in my life\u201d \u201cWe had sex on that floor four weeks ago,\u201d he cuts me off. \u201cRight there.\u201d He nods at a huge fluffy white sheepskin. I stare at it speechlessly. \u201cYou were on top,\u201d he adds. \u201cStop it!\u201d Flustered, I wheel around and stride away toward the far end of the space, where a trendy Lucite staircase rises to a mezzanine level. \u201cLet's take a look at the wet room complex,\u201d Jon says loudly as he follows me up. \u201cI think you'll like i t . . .\u201d \u201cNo, I won't,\u201d I shoot over my shoulder. \u201cLeave me alone.\u201c 200 We both reach the top of the staircase and turn to look over the steel balustrade. I can see Eric on the level below, and beyond, the lights of London through the massive windows. I have to hand it to him, it's a staggering apartment. Beside me, Jon is sniffing the air. \u201dHey,\u201c he says. \u201dHave you been eating salt and vinegar chips?\u201c \u201dMaybe.\u201c I give him a suspicious look. Jon's eyes open wide. \u201dI'm impressed. How did you sneak those past the food fascist?\u201c \u201dHe's not a food fascist,\u201c I say, feeling an immediate need to defend Eric. \u201dHe just... cares about nutrition.\u201c \u201dHe's Hitler. If he could round up every loaf of bread and put it in a camp, he would.\u201c \u201dStop it.\u201c \u201dHe'd gas them all. Finger rolls first. Then croissants.\u201c \u201dStop it.\u201c My mouth twists with an urge to giggle and I turn away. This guy is funnier than I thought at first. And he's kind of sexy, close up, with his rumpled dark hair. But then, lots of things are funny and sexy. Friends is funny and sexy. It doesn't mean I'm having an affair with it. \u201dWhat do you want?\u201c At last I turn to face Jon, helpless. \u201dWhat do you expect me to do?\u201c \u201dWhat do I want?\u201c He pauses, his brow knitted as though he's thinking it through. \u201dI want you to tell your husband you don't love him, come home with me, and start a new life together.\u201c He's serious. I almost want to laugh. \u201dYou want me to come and live with you,\u201c I say, as though to clarify arrangements. \u201dRight now. Just like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn, say, five minutes.\u201d He glances at his watch. \u201cI have a few things to do first.\u201d \u201cYou're a total psycho.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI'm not a psycho,\u201d he says patiently. \u201cI love you. You love me. Really. You have to take my word on that.\u201d \u201cI don't have to take your word on anything!\u201d I suddenly resent his confidence. \u201cI'm married, okay? I have a husband whom I love, whom I've promised to love forever. Here's the proof!\u201d I brandish my wedding ring at him. \u201cThis is proof!\u201d \u201cYou love him?\u201d Jon ignores the ring. \u201cYou feel love for him? Right deep down here?\u201d He thumps his chest.</p><p>I want to snap \u201cYes, I'm desperately in love with Eric\u201d and shut him up for good. But for some ridiculous reason I can't quite bring myself to lie. \u201cMaybe it's not quite there yet... but I'm sure it will be,\u201d I say, sounding more defiant than I meant to. \u201cEric's a fantastic guy. Everything's wonderful between us.\u201d \u201cUh-?huh.\u201d Jon nods politely. \u201cYou haven't had sex since the accident, have you?\u201d I stare at him mistrustfully. \u201cHave you?\u201d There's a glint in his eye. \u201c I . . . w e . . . \u201d I flounder. \u201cMaybe we have, maybe we haven't! I'm not in the habit of discussing my private life with you.\u201d \u201cYeah, you are.\u201d There's a sudden wryness in his face. \u201cYou are. That's the point.\u201d To my surprise he reaches for one of my hands. He just holds it for a moment, looking at it. Then, very slowly, he starts tracing over the skin with his thumb. I can't bring myself to move. My skin is fizzing; his thumb is leaving a trail of delicious sensation wherever it goes. I can feel tiny prickles up the back of my neck. 202 \u201cSo what do you think?\u201d Eric's booming voice heralds us from below and I jump a mile, whipping my hand away. What was I thinking? \u201cIt's great, darling!\u201d I trill back over the balustrade, my voice unnaturally high. \u201cWe'll just be a couple more seconds . . .\u201d I draw back, out of sight of the floor below, and beckon Jon to follow. \u201cLook, I've had enough,\u201d I say in a swift undertone. \u201cLeave me alone. I don't know you. I don't love you. Things are hard enough for me right now. I just want to get on with my life, with my husband. Okay?\u201d I make to head down the stairs. \u201cNo! Not okay!\u201d Jon grabs hold of my arm. \"Lexi, you don't know the whole picture.

It belongs to me.</p><p>I stare into my eyes, reflected an inch away in the mirrored wardrobe door. This is a new habit of mine, to stand right up close to the mirror so the only bit I can see is my eyes. It's comforting. It makes me feel as if I'm looking at the old me. \u201cRemember, you moron,\u201d I instruct myself in a low, fierce voice. \u201cRe-?mem-?ber.\u201d</p> <p>My eyes stare back at me as though they know everything but won't tell. I sigh, and lean my head against the glass in frustration. In the days since we got back from the show apartment, I've done nothing but immerse myself in the last three years. I've looked through photo albums, watched movies I know I've \u201cseen,\u201d listened to songs that I know the old Lexi heard a hundred times But nothing's worked. Whichever mental filing cabinet my missing memories are locked into, it's pretty sturdy. It's not about to fly open just because I listen to a song called \u201cYou're Beautiful\u201d by James... someone or other. Stupid secretive brain. I mean, who's in charge here? Me or it? Yesterday I went to see that neurologist, Neil. He nodded sympathetically as I poured everything out, and scribbled loads of notes. Then he said it was all fascinating and he might write a research paper on me. When I pressed him, he added that maybe it would help to write out a timeline, and I could go and see a therapist if I liked. But I don't need therapy. I need my memory. The mirror is misting up from my breath. I'm pressing my forehead harder against the mirror, as though the answers are all inside the mirror-?me, as though I can get them if I concentrate enough...</p><p>\u201cLexi? I'm off.\u201d Eric comes into the bedroom, holding a DVD, out of its box. \u201cDarling, you left this on the rug. Sensible location for a DVD?\u201d I take the disc from him. It's the Ambition EP 1 DVD that I started watching the other day.</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry, Eric,\u201d I say quickly, taking it from him. \u201cI don't know how it got there.\u201d That's a lie. It got there when Eric was out and I had about fifty DVDs all scattered over the rug, together with magazines and photo albums and candy wrappers. If he'd seen it, he'd have had a heart attack.</p><p>\u201cYour taxi will be here at ten,\u201d says Eric. \u201cI'm off now.\u201d \u201cGreat!\u201d I kiss him, like I do every morning now.

I'm going back to work today, full-?time. Not to take over the departmentobviously I'm not ready to do that. But to start relearning my job, catching up on what I've missed. It's five weeks since the accident. I can't just sit around at home anymore. I have to do something. I have to get my life back. And my friends. On the bed, all ready, are three glossy gift bags with presents inside for Fi, Debs, and Carolyn, which I'm going to take in today. I spent ages choosing the perfect gifts; in fact, every time I think about them I want to hug myself with pleasure. Humming, I head into the sitting room and slot the Ambition DVD into the player. I never did watch the rest of this. Maybe it'll help me get back into office mode. I fastforward through the introductory shots, until I come to a bit with me in a limo with two guys in suits, and press Play. \u201cLexi and her teammates won't be taking it easy tonight,\u201d explains a male voice-?over. The camera focuses in on me, and I hold my breath with anticipation. \u201cWe're going to win this task!\u201d I'm saying in a sharp voice to the guys, slapping the back of one hand on the other palm. \u201cIf we have to work around the clock, we're going to win. Okay? No excuses.\u201c My jaw drops slightly. Is that fierce, scary businesswoman me? I've never spoken like that in my life. \u201dAs ever, Lexi is taking her team to task,\u201c says the voiceover. \u201dBut has the Cobra gone too far this time?\u201d I don't quite understand what he's talking about. What cobra? The picture now flashes to one of the guys from the limo. He's sitting in an office chair, a night sky visible through the plate-?glass window behind him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe isn't human,\u201d he's muttering. \u201cThere's only so many fucking hours in the day. We're all doing our best, you know, but does she fucking care?\u201d As he's talking, an image of me striding around some warehouse has appeared on the screen. I feel a sudden dismay. Is he talking about me? Now the picture cuts to a full, stand-?up row between me and the same guy. We're standing on a London street and he's trying to defend himself, but I'm not letting him get a word in. \u201cYou're sacked!\u201d I snap at last, my voice so scathing that I wince. \u201cYou're sacked from my team!\u201d \u201cAnd the Cobra has struck!\u201d the jaunty voice-?over comes again. \u201cLet's see that moment again!\u201d Hang on a minute. Is he saying I'm the Cobra? To menacing music, a slow-?motion replay has begun onscreen, zooming right into my face. \u201cYou're ssssssacked!\u201d I'm hissing. \u201cYou're sssssacked from my team.\u201d I stare, light-?headed with horror. What the fuck have they done? They've manipulated my voice. It sounds like I'm a snake. \u201cAnd Lexi's in top venomous form this week!\u201d says the voice-?over. \u201cMeanwhile, over on the other team...\u201d A different group of people in suits appears on the screen and starts arguing about a price negotiation. But I'm too shell-?shocked to move. Why H o w - Why didn't anyone tell me? Why didn't anyone warn me about this? On autopilot, I reach for my phone and jab in Eric's number. \u201cHi, Lexi.\u201d \u201cEric, I just watched the DVD of that TV show!\u201d My 208 voice comes shooting out in agitation. \u201cThey called me the Cobra! I was a total bitch to everyone! You never told me about that!\u201d \u201cSweetheart, it was a great show,\u201d says Eric soothingly. \u201cYou came across really well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they named me after a snake.\u201d \u201cSo what?\u201d \u201cSo I don't want to be a snake!\u201d I know I sound almost hysterical, but I can't help it. \u201cNo one likes snakes! I'm more like a . . . a squirrel. Or a koala.\u201d Koalas are soft and furry. And a bit snaggly. \u201cA koala? Lexi!\u201d Eric laughs. \u201cDarling, you're a cobra. You have timing. You have attack. That's what makes you a great businesswoman.\u201d \u201cBut I don't want to be\u201d I break off as the buzzer sounds. \u201cMy taxi's here. I'd better go.\u201d I head into the bedroom and pick up my three glossy gift bags, trying to regain my former optimism, trying to be excited about the day again. But suddenly all my confidence has evaporated. I'm a snake. No wonder everyone hates me. As my taxi wends its way toward the Victoria Palace Road, I sk rigid on the backseat, clutching my gift bags, giving myself a pep talk. First of all, everyone knows the TV skews things. No one really thinks I'm a snake. Besides which, that TV show was ages agoeveryone's probably forgotten about it. Oh God. The trouble with giving yourself a pep talk is, deep down you know it's all bullshit. The taxi deposits me outside the building and I take a deep breath, tugging my beige Armani suit straight. Then with trepidation, I make my way up to the third floor. As I step out of the lift the first thing I see is Fi, Carolyn, and Debs standing by the coffee machine. Fi is gesturing to her hair and talking with animation while Carolyn chips in, but as I appear the conversation instantly stops, as though someone pulled the plug on the radio. \u201cHi, you guys!\u201d I look around with the warmest, friendliest smile I can muster. \u201cI'm back again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Lexi.\u201d There's a general muted reply and Fi makes a kind of acknowledging shrug. Okay, it wasn't a smilebut at least it was a reaction. \u201cYou look really nice, Fi! That top's great.\u201d I gesture at her cream shirt and she follows my gaze in surprise. \u201cAnd Debs, you look fab too. And Carolyn! Your hair looks so cool, all cropped like that and... and those boots are fantastic!\u201d \u201cThese?\u201d Carolyn snorts with laughter and kicks one brown suede boot against the other. \u201cI've had them for years.\u201d \u201cWell, still... they're really striking!\u201d I'm gabbling with nerves, talking a load of bollocks. No wonder they all seem unimpressed. Fi's arms are folded and Debs looks like she wants to giggle.</p><p>\u201cSo, anyway...\u201d I force myself to slow down a bit. \u201cI got you all a little something. Fi, this is for you, and Debs...\u201d As I hand over the gift bags they suddenly look ridiculously shiny and conspicuous.</p> <p>\u201cWhat's this for?\u201d Debs says blankly. \u201cWell, you know! Just t o . . . u m . . . \u201d I falter slightly. \u201cYou guys are my friends, and... Go on. Open them!\u201d Giving each other uncertain looks, all three start ripping at their wrapping paper. 210 \u201cGucci?\u201d Fi says in disbelief as she pulls out a green jewelry box. \u201cLexi, I can't accept\u201d \u201cYes, you can! Please. Just open it, you'll see...\u201d Silently, Fi snaps it open to reveal a gold bangle watch. \u201cD'you remember?\u201d I say eagerly. \u201cWe always used to look at them in the shop windows. Every weekend. And now you've actually got one!\u201d \u201cActually...\u201d Fi sighs, looking uncomfortable. \u201cLexi, I got it two years ago.\u201d She lifts up her sleeve and she's wearing exactly the same watch, only a little duller and older-?looking. \u201cOh,\u201d I say, my heart sinking. \u201cOh, right. Well, never mind. I can take it back, or exchange it, we can get something else...\u201d \u201cLexi, I can't use this,\u201d Carolyn chimes in, and hands back the perfume gift set I bought her, together with the leather tote it came in. \u201cThat smell makes me gag.\u201d \u201cBut it's your favorite,\u201d I say in bewilderment. \u201cWas,\u201d she corrects me. \u201cBefore I fell pregnant.\u201d \u201cYou're pregnant?\u201d I stare at her, overwhelmed. \u201cOh my God! Carolyn, congratulations! That's so wonderful! I'm so happy for you. Matt will be the best dad ever\u201d \u201cIt's not Mart's baby.\u201d She cut me off flat. \u201cIt's not?\u201d I say stupidly. \u201cBut what...Did you two break up?\u201d They can't have broken up. It's impossible. Everyone assumed Carolyn and Matt would be together forever. \u201cI don't want to talk about it, okay?\u201d Carolyn says almost in a whisper. To my horror I see her eyes have turned pink behind her glasses and she's breathing hard. \u201cSee you.\u201d She thrusts all the wrapping paper and ribbon at me, then turns and strides off, back toward the office. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGreat, Lexi,\u201d says Fi sarcastically. \u201cJust when we thought she'd finally got over Matt.\u201d \u201cI didn't know!\u201d I say, aghast. \u201cI had no idea. I'm so sorry...\u201d I rub my face, feeling hot and flustered. \u201cDebs, open your present.\u201d I bought Debs a cross studded with tiny diamonds. She's so crazy about jewelry, and you can't go wrong with a cross. She has to love it. In silence Debs pulls off the wrapping. \u201cI know it's quite extravagant,\u201d I say nervously. \u201cBut I wanted to get something really special\u201d \u201cThis is a cross!\u201d Debs thrusts the box back at me, her nose wrinkled as though it smells of something rancid. \u201cI can't wear this! I'm Jewish.\u201d \u201cYou're Jewish?\u201d My mouth hangs open. \u201cSince when?\u201d \u201cSince I've been engaged to Jacob,\u201d she says as though it's obvious. \u201cI've converted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d I say joyfully. \u201cYou're engaged?\u201d And of course now I can't miss the platinum ring on her left hand, with a diamond lodged right in the center of the band. Debs wears so many rings, I hadn't noticed it. \u201cWhen's the wedding?\u201d My words spill out in excitement. \u201cWhere's it happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext month.\u201d She looks away. \u201cIn Wiltshire.\u201d \u201cNext month! Oh my God, Debs! But I haven't got\u201d I break off abruptly into a kind of hot, thudding silence. I was about to say \u201cBut I haven't got an invitation.\u201d I haven't got an invitation because I haven't been invited. \u201cI mean... urn...congratulations!\u201d Somehow I keep a bright smile plastered on my face. \u201cI hope it all goes brilliantly. And don't worry, I can easily return the cross... and the watch...and the perfume \u201d With trembling fingers 212 I start stuffing all the ripped wrapping paper into one of the gift bags. \u201cYeah,\u201d Fi says in an awkward voice. \u201cWell, see you, Lexi.\u201d \u201cBye.\u201d Debs still can't look me in the eye. They both walk off and I watch them go, my chin stiff from wanting to cry. Great work, Lexi. You didn't win your friends back you just fucked up everything even more. \u201cA present for me?\u201d Byron's sarcastic voice hits the back of my head and I turn to see him loping along the corridor, coffee in hand. \u201cHow sweet of you, Lexi!\u201d God, he gives me the creeps. He's the snake. \u201cHi, Byron,\u201d I say as briskly as I can. \u201cGood to see you.\u201d Summoning all my strength, I lift my chin high and sweep a stray hair back off my face. I can't crumble. \u201cIt's very brave of you to come back, Lexi,\u201d Byron says as we head down the corridor. \u201cVery admirable.\u201d \u201cNot really!\u201d I say as confidently as I can. \u201cI'm looking forward to it.\u201d \u201cWell, any questions, you know where I am. Although today I'll be with James Garrison most of the day. You remember James Garrison?\u201d Bloody bloody bloody. Why does he pick the people I've never heard of?</p><p>\u201cRemind me,\u201d I say reluctantly. \u201cHe's head of our distributor, Southeys? They distribute stock around the country? Like, carpet, flooring, the stuff we sell? They drive it around in lorries?\u201d His tone is polite, but he's smirking. \u201cYes, I remember Southeys,\u201d I say cuttingly. \u201cThanks. Why are you seeing them?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d says Byron after a pause. \u201cThe truth is, they've lost their way. It's crunch time. If they can't improve their systems, we're going to have to look elsewhere.\u201c \u201dRight.\u201c I nod in as bosslike a way as I can. \u201dWell, keep me posted.\u201c We've reached my office and I open the door. \u201dSee you later, Byron.\u201c I close the door, dump my gift bags on the sofa, open the filing cabinet, and take out an entire drawer's worth of files. Trying not to feel daunted, I sit down at the desk and open the first one, which contains minutes of departmental meetings. Three years. I can catch up on three years. It's not that long. m Twenty minutes later, my brain is already aching. I haven't read anything serious or heavy for what seems like monthsand this stuff is as dense as treacle. Budget discussions. Contracts up for renewal. Performance evaluations. I feel like I'm back at college, doing about six degrees at once. I've started a sheet of paper: Questions to ask, and already I'm onto the second side. \u201dHow are you doing?\u201c The door has opened silently and Byron is looking in. Doesn't he knock? \u201dFine,\u201c I say defensively. \u201dReally well. I just have a couple of tiny questions...\u201c \u201dFire away.\u201c He leans against the doorjamb. \u201dOkay. First, what's QAS?\u201c \u201dThat's our new accounting system software. Everyone's been trained in it.\u201c \u201dWell, I can get trained too,\u201c I say briskly, scribbling on my sheet. \u201dAnd what's Services.com?\u201d 214 \u201cOur online customer service provider.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d I wrinkle my brow, confused. \u201cBut what about the customer services department?\u201d \u201cAll made redundant years ago,\u201d says Byron, sounding bored. \u201cThe company was restructured and a load of departments were contracted out.\u201d \u201cRight.\u201d I nod, trying to take all this in, and glance down at my sheet again. \u201cSo what about BD Brooks? What's that?\u201d \u201cThey're our ad agency,\u201d Byron says with exaggerated patience. \u201cThey make advertisements for us, on the radio and the TV\u201d \u201cI know what an ad agency is!\u201d I snap, more hotly than I intended. \u201cSo, what happened to Pinkham Smith? We've had such a great relationship with them\u201d \u201cThey don't exist anymore.\u201d Byron rolls his eyes. \u201cThey went bust. Jesus, Lexi, you don't know a bloody thing, do you?\u201d I open my mouth to retortbut I can't. He's right. It's as if the landscape I knew has been swept away by some kind of hurricane. Everything's been rebuilt and I don't recognize any of it. \u201cYou're never going to pick all this up again.\u201d Byron is surveying me pityingly. \u201cYes, I am!\u201d \u201cLexi, face it. You're mentally ill. You shouldn't be putting your head under this kind of strain\u201d \u201cI'm not mentally ill!\u201d I exclaim furiously, and get to my feet. I push roughly past Byron and out the door, and Clare looks up in alarm, snapping her mobile phone shut. \u201cHi, Lexi. Did you want something? A cup of coffee?\u201d She looks terrified, like I'm about to bite her head off or fire her or something. Okay, now is my chance to show her I'm not a bitch-?boss-?from-?hell. I'm me.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi, Clare!\u201d I say in my most friendly, warm manner, and perch on the corner of her desk. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d \u201cUm... yes.\u201d Her eyes are wide and wary. \u201cI just wondered if you'd like me to get you a coffee?\u201d \u201cYou?\u201d She stares as though suspecting a trick. \u201cGet me a coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Why not?\u201d I beam, and she flinches. \u201cIt's...it's okay.\u201d She slides out of her chair, her eyes fixed on me as though she thinks I really am a cobra. \u201cI'll get one.\u201d \u201cWait!\u201d I say almost desperately. \u201cYou know, Clare, I'd like to get to know you better. Maybe one day we could have lunch together... hang out... go shopping...\u201d Clare looks even more pole-?axed than before. \u201cUm...yeah. Okay, Lexi,\u201d she mumbles, and scuttles down the corridor. I turn to see Byron still in the doorway, cracking up. \u201cWhat?\u201d I snap. \u201cYou really are a different person, aren't you?\u201d He raises his eyebrows in wonder. \u201cMaybe I just want to be friendly with my staff and treat them with respect,\u201d I say defiantly. \u201cAnything wrong with that?\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d Byron lifts his hands. \u201cLexi, that's a great idea.\u201d He runs his eyes over me, that sarcastic smile still at his lips, then clicks his tongue as though remembering something. \u201cThat reminds me. Before I shoot off, there's one thing I left for you to deal with as director of the department. I thought it only right.\u201d At last. He's treating me like the boss. \u201cOh, yes?\u201d I lift my chin. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cWe've had an e-?mail from on high about people abusing lunch hours.\u201d He reaches into his pocket and produces a 216 piece of paper. \u201cSJ wants all directors to give their teams a bollocking. Today, preferably.\u201d Byron raises his eyebrows innocently. \u201cCan I leave that one to you?\u201d Bastard. Bastard. I'm pacing about my office, sipping my coffee, my stomach churning with nerves. I've never told anyone off before. Let alone a whole department. Let alone while simultaneously trying to prove that I'm really friendly and not a bitch-?boss-?from-?hell. I look yet again at the printed-?out e-?mail from Natasha, Simon Johnson's personal assistant.</p><p>Colleagues. It has come to Simon's attention that members of staff are regularly pushing the limit of lunchtime well beyond the standard hour. This is unacceptable. He would be grateful if you could make this plain to your teams ASAP, and enforce a stricter policy of checks.</p><p>Thanks. Natasha Okay. The point is, it doesn't actually say \u201cgive your department a bollocking.\u201d I don't need to be aggressive or anything. I can make the point while still being pleasant. Maybe I can be all jokey and friendly! I'll start off, \u201cHey, guys! Are your lunch hours long enough?\u201d I'll roll my eyes to show I'm being ironic and everyone will laugh, and someone will say, \u201cIs there a problem, Lexi?\u201d And I'll smile ruefully and say, \u201cIt's not me, it's the stuffed shirts upstairs. So let's just try and make it back on time, yeah?\u201d And a few people will nod as though to say \u201cfair enough.\u201d And it'll all be fine.</p> <p>Yes. That sounds good. Taking a deep breath, I fold the paper and put it away in my pocket, then head out of my office, into the open-?plan main Flooring office. There's the chatter and buzz of people on the phone and typing and chatting to each other. For about a minute no one even notices me. Then Fi looks up and nudges Carolyn, and she prods a girl I don't recognize, who brings her phone conversation to an end. Around the room, receivers go down and people look up from their screens and chairs swivel around, until gradually the whole office has come to a standstill. \u201cHi, everyone!\u201d I say, my face prickling. \u201c I . . . u m . .. Hey, guys! How's it going?\u201d No one replies, or even acknowledges that I've spoken. They're all just staring up with the same mute, get-?on-?withit expression. \u201cAnyway!\u201d I try to sound bright and cheerful. \u201cI just wanted to say... Are your lunch hours long enough?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d The girl at my old desk looks blank. \u201cAre we allowed longer ones?\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cI mean... they're too long.\u201d \u201cI think they're fine.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cAn hour's just right for a bit of shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d agrees another girl. \u201cYou can just make it to the King's Road and back.\u201d Okay, I am really not getting my point across here. And now two girls in the corner have started talking again. \u201cListen, everyone! Please!\u201d My voice is becoming shrill. \u201cI have to tell you something. About lunch hours. Some people in the company...um...I mean, not necessarily any of you\u201d</p><p>\u201cLexi,\u201d says Carolyn clearly. \u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d Fi and Debs explode with laughter and my face flames with color. 218 \u201cLook, guys,\u201d I try to keep my composure. \u201cThis is serious.\u201d \u201cSeriousssss,\u201d someone echoes, and there are sniggers about the room. \u201cIt's sssseriousssss.\u201d \u201cVery funny!\u201d I try to smile. \u201cBut listen, seriously...\u201d \u201cSssseriousssly...\u201d Now almost everyone in the room seems to be hissing or laughing or both. All the faces are alive; everyone's enjoying the joke, except me. All of a sudden a paper airplane flies past my ear and lands on the floor. I jump with shock and the entire office erupts with gales of laughter. \u201cOkay, well, look, just don't take too long over lunch, okay?\u201d I say desperately. No one's listening. Another paper airplane hits me on the nose, followed by an eraser. In spite of myself, tears spring to my eyes. \u201cAnyway, I'll see you guys!\u201d I manage. \u201cThanks for... for all your hard work.\u201d With laughter following me I turn and stumble out of the office. In a daze, I head toward the ladies' room, passing Dana on the way. \u201cGoing to the bathroom, Lexi?\u201d she says in surprise as I'm pushing my way in. \u201cYou know, you have a key to the executive washroom! Much nicer!\u201d \u201cI'm fine in here.\u201d I force a smile. \u201cReally.\u201d I head straight for the end cubicle, slam the door shut, and sink down with my head in my hands, feeling the tension drain from my body. That was the single most humiliating experience of my life. Except for the white swimsuit episode. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why did I ever want to be a boss?

I'm running my eye down the messages, smiling at some libelous story about Simon Johnson, when a new message in blue marker catches my eye. It's in Debs's handwriting and it reads: \u201cThe Cobra's back.\u201d And underneath, in faint black Biro: \u201cDon't worry, I spat in her coffee.\u201d There's only one way to go. And that's to get really, really, really drunk. An hour later and I'm slumped at the bar at the Bathgate Hotel, around the corner from work, finishing my third mojito. Already the world has turned a little blurrybut that's fine by me. As far as I'm concerned, the blurrier the better. Just as long as I can keep my balance on this bar stool. \u201cHi.\u201d I lift my hand to get the attention of the barman. \u201cI'd like another one, please.\u201d The barman raises his eyebrows very slightly, then says, \u201cOf course.\u201d I watch him a touch resentfully as he gets out the mint. Isn't he going to ask me why I want another one? Isn't he going to offer me some homespun barman wisdom? He puts the cocktail on a coaster and adds a bowl of peanuts, which I push aside scornfully. I don't want anything soaking up the alcohol. I want it right in my bloodstream. 220 \u201cCan I get you anything else? A snack, perhaps?\u201d He gestures at a small menu, but I ignore it and take a deep gulp of the mojito. It's cold and tangy and limey and perfect. \u201cDo I look like a bitch to you?\u201d I say as I look up. \u201cHonestly?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d The barman smiles. \u201cWell, I am, apparently.\u201d I take another slug of mojito. \u201cThat's what all my friends say.\u201d \u201cSome friends.\u201d \u201cThey used to be.\u201d I put my cocktail down and stare at it morosely. \u201cI don't know where my life went wrong.\u201d I sound slurred, even to my own ears. \u201cThat's what they all say.\u201d A guy sitting at the end of the bar looks up from his Evening Standard. He has an American accent and dark, receding hair. \u201cNo one knows where it went wrong.\u201d \u201cNo, but I really don't know.\u201d I lift a finger impressively. \u201cI have a car crash... and boom! I wake up and I'm trapped in the body of a bitch.\u201d \u201cLooks like you're trapped in the body of a babe to me.\u201d The American guy edges along to the next bar stool, a smile on his face. \u201cI wouldn't trade that body for anything.\u201d I gaze at him in puzzlement for a momentuntil realization dawns. \u201cOh! You're flirting with me! Sorry. But I'm already married. To a guy. My husband.\u201d I lift up my left hand, locate my wedding ring after a few moments, and point at it. \u201cYou see. Married.\u201d I think intently for a moment. \u201cAlso, I may have a lover.\u201d There's a muffled snort from the barman. I look up suspiciously, but his face is straight. I take another gulp of my drink and feel the alcohol kicking in, dancing around my head. My ears are buzzing and the room is starting to sway. Which is a good thing. Rooms should sway. \u201cYou know, I'm not drinking to forget,\u201d I say conversationally to the barman. \u201cI already forgot everything.\u201d This suddenly strikes me as being so funny, I start giggling uncontrollably. \u201cI had one bang on the head and I forgot everything.\u201d I'm clutching my stomach; tears are edging out of my eyes. \u201cI even forgot I had a husband. But I do!\u201d \u201cUh-?huh.\u201d The barman is exchanging glances with the American guy. \u201cAnd they said there isn't a cure. But you know, doctors can be wrong, can't they?\u201d I appeal to the bar. Quite a few people seem to be listening now, and a couple of them nod. \u201cDoctors are always wrong,\u201d the American guy says emphatically. \u201cThey're all assholes.\u201d \u201cExactly!\u201d I swivel to him. \u201cYou are so right! Okay.\u201d I take a deep gulp of my mojito, then turn back to the barman. \u201cCan I ask you a small favor? Can you take that cocktail shaker and hit me over the head with it? They said it wouldn't work, but how do they know?\u201d The barman smiles, as if he thinks I'm joking. \u201cGreat.\u201d I sigh impatiently. \u201cI'll have to do it myself.\u201d Before he can stop me, I grab the cocktail shaker and whack myself on the forehead. \u201cOw!\u201d I drop the shaker and clutch my head. \u201cOuch! That hurt!\u201d \u201cDid you see that?\u201d I can hear someone exclaiming behind me. \u201cShe's a nutter!\u201d \u201cMiss, are you all right?\u201d The barman looks alarmed. \u201cCan I call you a\u201d \u201cWait!\u201d I lift a hand. For a few moments I'm poised, completely still, waiting for memories to flood into my 222 brain. Then I subside in disappointment. \u201cIt didn't work. Not even one. Bugger.\u201d \u201cI'd get her a strong black coffee,\u201d I can hear the American guy saying in an undertone to the barman. Bloody nerve. I don't want a coffee. I'm about to tell him this, when my phone beeps. After a small struggle with the zipper of my bag I get my phone outand it's a text from Eric. Hi, on my way home. E \u201cThat's from my husband,\u201d I inform the barman as I put away my phone. \u201cYou know, he can drive a speedboat.\u201d \u201cGreat,\u201d says the barman politely. \u201cYeah. It is.\u201d I nod emphatically, about seven times. \u201cIt is great. It's the perfect, perfect marriage...\u201d I consider for a moment. \u201cExcept we haven't had sex.\u201d \u201cYou haven't had sex?\u201d the American guy echoes in astonishment. \u201cWe have had sex.\u201d I take a slug of mojito and lean toward him confidentially. \u201cI just don't remember it.\u201d \u201cThat good, huh?\u201d He starts to laugh. \u201cBlew your mind, huh?\u201d Blew my mind. His words land in my mind like a big neon flashing light. Blew my mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d I say slowly. \u201cYou may not realize it, but that's very sig... sigficant... significant.\u201d I'm not sure that word came out quite right. But I know what I mean. If I have sex, maybe it'll blow my mind. Maybe that's just what I need! Maybe Amy was right all along, it's nature's own amnesia-?cure.</p><p>\u201cI'm going to do it.\u201d I put my glass down with a crash. \u201cI'm going to have sex with my husband!\u201d 223 \u201cYou go, girl!\u201d says the American, laughing. \u201cHave fun.\u201d</p><p>I'm going to have sex with Eric. This is my mission. As I ride home in a taxi I'm quite excited. As soon as I get back, I'll jump him. And we'll have amazing sex and my mind will be blown and suddenly everything will be clear. The only tiny snag I can think of is I don't have the marriage manual on me. And I can't totally remember the order of foreplay. I close my eyes, trying to ignore my dizzy head and recall exactly what Eric wrote. Something was in a clockwise direction. And something else was with \u201cgentle, then urgent tongue strokes.\u201d Thighs? Chest? I should have memorized it. Or written it on a Post-?it; I could have stuck it on the headboard. Okay, I think I have it. Buttocks first, then inner thighs, then scrotum... \u201cSorry?\u201d says the taxi driver. Oops. I didn't realize I was speaking aloud. \u201cNothing!\u201d I say hastily. Earlobes came in somewhere, I suddenly remember. Maybe that was the urgent tongue strokes. Anyway, it doesn't matter. What I can't remember I'll make up. I mean, it can't be that we're some boring old married couple and do it exactly the same way each time, can it?</p><p>Can it? I feel a tiny qualm, which I ignore. It's going to be great. Plus, I have fantastic underwear on. Silky and matching, and everything. I don't even possess anything scaggy anymore. We draw up in front of the building and I pay the taxi 224 driver. As I travel up in the lift I remove the chewing gum that I've been chewing for fresh breath, and unbutton my shirt a bit. Too far. You can see my bra. I do it up again, let myself into the apartment, and call out, \u201cEric!\u201d There's no answer, so I head toward the office. I am quite drunk, to tell the truth. I'm lurching on my heels, and the walls are going backward and forward in my field of vision. We'd better not try and do it standing up. I arrive at the door of the office and look for a few moments at Eric, who's working at his computer. On the screen I can see the brochure for Blue 42, his new building. The launch party is in a few days, and he's spending all his time preparing his presentation. Okay, what he should do now is sense the charged sexual vibe in the room, turn around, and see me. But he doesn't. \u201cEric,\u201d I say in my most husky, sensual voicebut still he doesn't move. Suddenly I realize he's wearing earphones. \u201cEric!\u201d I yell, and at last he turns around. He pulls out his earphones and smiles. \u201cHi. Good day?\u201d \u201cEric... take me.\u201d I push a hand through my hair. \u201cLet's do it. Blow my mind.\u201d He peers at me for a few seconds. \u201cSweetheart, have you been drinking?\u201d \u201cI may have had a couple of cocktails. Or three.\u201d I nod, then hold on to the door frame for balance. \u201cThe point is, they made me realize what I want. What I need. Sex.\u201d \u201cOooo-?kay.\u201d Eric raises his eyebrows. \u201cMaybe you should sober up, have something to eat. Gianna made us a great seafood stew\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don't want seafood stew!\u201d I feel like stamping my foot. \u201cWe have to do it! It's the only way I'll ever remember!\u201d What's wrong with him? I was expecting him to leap on me, but instead he's rubbing his forehead with the back of his fist.</p><p>\u201cLexi, I don't want to rush you into anything. This is a big decision. The doctor at the hospital said we should only go to whatever stage you're comfortable with\u201d \u201cWell, I'm comfortable with us doing it right now.\u201d I undo two more buttons, exposing my La Perla underwire plunge bra. God, my boobs look great in this. I mean, they ought to, for sixty quid. \u201cCome on.\u201d I lift my chin in a challenging way. \u201cI'm your wife.\u201d I can see Eric's mind working as he stares at me. \u201cWell...okay!\u201d He closes his document and turns off the computer, then walks over, puts his arms around me, and starts kissing me. And it's... nice. It is. It's... pleasant. His mouth is quite soft. I noticed that before. It's a bit weird for a man. I mean, it's not exactly wwsexy, but \u201cAre you comfortable, Lexi?\u201d Eric's breathy voice comes in my ear. \u201cYes!\u201d I whisper back. \u201cShall we move to the bedroom?\u201d \u201cOkay!\u201d Eric leads the way out of the office and I follow him, stumbling slightly on my heels. It all seems a bit oddly formal, like he's showing me in to a job interview. In the bedroom, we resume kissing. Eric seems really into it, but I have no idea what I'm supposed to do next. I 226 glimpse the marriage manual on the ottoman and wonder if I could quickly nudge it open to Foreplay with my toe. Except Eric might notice. Now he's pulling me down onto the bed. I have to reciprocate. But with what? Eeny-?meeny-?miney No. Stop it. I'm going to go with... chest. Unbutton the shirt. Sweeping strokes. Clockwise. He does have a good chest. I'll give him that. Firm and muscled from the hour he spends in the gym every day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you comfortable with me touching your breast?\u201d he murmurs as he starts undoing my bra. \u201cI guess so,\u201d I murmur back. Why is he squeezing me? It's like he's buying fruit. He's going to give me a bruise in a minute.</p><p>Anyway. Stop being picky. This is all great. I have a fab husband with a fab body and we're in bed and Ouch. That was my nipple. \u201cI'm sorry,\u201d whispers Eric. \u201cListen, sweetheart, are you comfortable with me touching your abdomen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... I guess!\u201d Why did he ask that? Why would I be comfortable with the breast and not the abdomen? That doesn't make sense. And to be absolutely honest, I don't know if comfortable is the word. This is all a bit surreal. We're moving around and panting and doing it all like in a book, but I don't feel like I'm going anywhere. Eric's breath is hot on my neck. I think it's time for me to do something else. Buttocks, maybe, o r . . . Oh, right. From the way Eric's hands are moving, looks like we're jumping straight to inner thighs. \u201cYou're hot,\u201d he's saying, his voice urgent. \u201cJesus, you're hot. This is so hot.\u201d</p><p>I don't believe this! He says hot the whole time too! He should so have sex with Debs. Oh. No. Obviously he shouldn't have sex with Debs. Erase that thought. Suddenly I realize I'm about three steps behind on the whole foreplay thing, not to mention the sex talk. But Eric doesn't even seem to have noticed. \u201cLexi, sweetheart?\u201d he murmurs breathily, right in my ear. \u201cYes?\u201d I whisper back, wondering if he's about to say \u201cI love you.\u201d \u201cAre you comfortable with me putting my penis into your\u201d Uurk! Before I can stop myself, I've pushed him off me and rolled away.</p> <p>Oops. I didn't mean to shove quite so hard. \u201cWhat's wrong?\u201d Eric sits up in alarm. \u201cLexi! What happened? Are you okay? Did you have a flashback?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d I bite my lip. \u201cI'm sorry. I just suddenly felt a bit...um...\u201d \u201cI knew it. I knew we were rushing things.\u201d Eric sighs and takes both my hands. \u201cLexi, talk to me. Why weren't you comfortable? Was it because of some... traumatic memory resurfacing?\u201d Oh God. He looks so earnest. I have to lie. No. I can't lie. Marriages only work if you're totally honest. \u201cIt wasn't because of a traumatic memory,\u201d I say at last, carefully looking past him at the duvet. \u201cIt was because you said 'penis.'\u201d \u201cPenis?\u201d Eric looks utterly stumped. \u201cWhat's wrong with penis I 228 \u201dIt's just... you know. Not very sexy. As words go.\u201c Eric leans back against the headboard, his brow knitted in a frown. \u201dI find 'penis' sexy,\u201c he says at last. \u201dOh, right!\u201c I backtrack quickly. \u201dWell, I mean, obviously it is quite sexy...\u201c How can he find the word \u201dpenis\u201c sexy? \u201dAnyway, it wasn't just that.\u201c I hastily change the subject. \u201dIt was the way you kept asking me every two seconds if I was comfortable. It made things a bit... formal. Don't you think?\u201c \u201dI'm just trying to be considerate,\u201c says Eric stiffly. \u201dThis is a pretty strange situation for both of us.\u201c He turns away and starts pulling on his shirt with jerky gestures. \u201dI know!\u201c I say quickly. \u201dAnd I appreciate it, I really do.\u201c I put a hand on his shoulder. \u201dBut maybe we can loosen up. Be more... spontaneous?\u201c Eric's silent for a while, as though weighing up what I've said. \u201dSo... should I sleep here tonight?\u201c he says at last. \u201dOh!\" In spite of myself I recoil. What's wrong with me? Eric's my husband. A moment ago I was all for having sex with him. But still, the idea of him sleeping here with me all night seems... too intimate. \u201cMaybe we could leave it a while. I'm sorry, it's just...\u201d \u201cFine. I understand.\u201d Without meeting my eye he gets up. \u201cI think I'll take a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Left alone, I slump back on the pillows. Great. I didn't have sex. I didn't remember anything. My mission totally failed. I find \u201cpenis\u201d sexy. I give a sudden gurgle and clap my hand over my mouth in case he can hear me. Beside the bed the phone starts ringing, but at first I don't moveit's bound to be for Eric. Then I realize he must be in the shower. I reach over and pick up the state-?of-?the-?art Bang &amp; Olufsen receiver. \u201cHello?\u201d \u201cHi,\u201d comes a dry, familiar voice. \u201cIt's Jon.\u201d \u201cJon?\u201d I feel a white-?hot thrill. Eric's nowhere in sight, but even so, I dart into the adjoining bathroom with the phone, then shut the door and lock it. \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d I hiss in lowered, furious tones. \u201cWhat are you ringing here for? It's so risky! What if Eric picked up?\u201d \u201cI was expecting Eric to pick up.\u201d Jon sounds a bit baffled. \u201cI need to speak with him.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d I halt in sudden realization. I'm so stupid. \u201cOh... right.\u201d Trying to remedy the situation, I put on a formal, wifely voice. \u201cOf course, Jon. I'll just fetch him\u201d Jon cuts me off. \u201cBut I need to speak with you more. We have to meet. We have to talk.\u201d \u201cWe can't! You have to stop this. This whole... talking thing. On the phone. And also not on the phone.\u201d \u201cLexi, are you drunk?\u201d says Jon. \u201cNo.\u201d I survey my bloodshot reflection. \u201cOkay... maybe a tad.\u201d There's a snuffling sound at the end of the phone. Is he laughing? \u201cI love you,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don't know me.\u201d \u201cI love the girl... you were. You are.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYpu love the Cobra?\u201d I retort sharply. \u201cYou love the bitch from hell?

And you made some pretty big mistakes. But you weren't a bitch.\u201d Beneath my drunken haze, I'm absorbing every word. It's like he's rubbing salve on some raw part of me.

What am I getting into here? \u201cStop. Just...stop!\u201d I cut across him. \u201cI need t o . .. think.\u201d I pace to the other side of the room, thrusting my hand through my hair, trying to force some rational thoughts into my giddy head. We could meet, and just talk... No. No. I can't start seeing someone behind Eric's back. I want my marriage to work. \u201cEric and I just had sex!\u201d I say defiantly. I'm not even quite sure why I said that. There's silence down the line and I wonder whether Jon is so offended he's gone. Well, if he has, that's a good thing. \u201cYour point would be?\u201d His voice comes down the line. \u201cYou know. That changes things, surely.\u201d \u201cI'm not following. You think I won't be in love with you anymore because you had sex with Eric?\u201d \u201c I . . . I don't know. Maybe.\u201d \u201cOr you think having sex with Eric somehow proves you love him?\u201d He's relentless. \u201cI don't know!\u201d I say again, rattled. I shouldn't even be having this conversation. I should be marching straight out of the bathroom, holding the phone aloft, calling, \u201cDarling? It's Jon for you.\u201d</p><p>But something's keeping me here, the receiver clamped to my ear. \u201cI thought it might trigger my memories,\u201d I say at last, sitting on the side of the bath. \u201cI just keep thinking, maybe my memory's all there, all locked up, and if only I could get to i t . . . It's so frustrating...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Jon says wryly, and I suddenly imagine him standing in his gray T-?shirt and jeans, scrunching his face up in that way he does, holding the phone with one hand, the other elbow bent with his hand behind his head a glimpse of armpit The image is so vivid that I blink. \u201cSo, how was it? The sex.\u201d His tone has changed, is easier. \u201cIt was...\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cYou know. Sex. You know about sex.\u201d \u201cI do know about sex,\u201d he agrees. \u201cI also know about sex with Eric. He's adept... considerate... He has quite the imagination...\u201d \u201cStop it! You're making all of those sound like bad qualities\u201d \u201cWe have to meet,\u201d Jon cuts in. \u201cSeriously.\u201d \u201cWe can't.\u201d I feel a fearful quake deep inside me. Like I'm about to step over an edge. Like I have to stop myself. \u201cI miss you so much.\u201d His voice is lower, softer. \u201cLexi, you have no idea how much I miss you, it's tearing me up, not being with you\u201d My hand is damp around the phone. I can't listen to him anymore. It's confusing me; it's shaking me up. Because if it was true, if everything he was saying was really true 232 \u201cLook, I have to go,\u201d I say in a rush. \u201cI'll get Eric for you.\u201d My legs wobbly, I unlock the bathroom door and head out, holding the phone away from me like it's contaminated. \u201cLexi, wait.\u201d I can hear his voice coming from the phone, but I ignore it. \u201cEric!\u201d I call brightly as I approach his door and he comes out, dressed in a towel. \u201cDarling? It's Jon for you. Jon the architect.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 13</p> <p>I've tried. I really have tried. I've done everything I can think of to show the department that I'm not a bitch. I've put up a poster asking for suggestions for a fun department outingbut no one's filled any in. I've put flowers on the windowsills, but no one's even mentioned them. Today I brought in a massive basket of blueberry, vanilla, and chocolate-?chip muffins and put it on the photocopier, together with a sign saying From LexiHelp Yourself!</p><p>I took a stroll into the office a few minutes ago and not a single muffin had been taken. But never mind, it's still early. I'll leave it another ten minutes before I go and check again. I turn a page in the file I've been reading, then click on the onscreen document. I'm working through paper files and computer files at the same time, trying to cross-?reference everything. Without meaning to, I give an enormous yawn and lean my head on the desk. I'm tired. I mean, I'm knackered. 234 I've been coming in every morning at seven, just to get through some more of this mountain of paperwork. My eyes are red from all the endless reading. I nearly didn't come back here at all. The day after Eric and I \u201ckind of\u201d had sex, I woke up with a pale face, the most crashing headache, and absolutely no desire to go to work again, ever. I staggered into the kitchen, made a cup of tea with three spoonfuls of sugar, then sat down and wrote out on a sheet of paper, wincing at every movement: OPTIONS 1. Give up. 2. Don't give up. I stared at it for ages. Then at last I put a line through Give up. The thing with giving up is you never know. You never know whether you could have done the job. And I'm sick of not knowing about my life. So here I am, in my office, reading through a debate on carpet-?fiber cost trends, dating from 2005. Just in case it's important. No. Come on. It can't be important. I close the file, stand up, shake out my legs, then tiptoe to my door. I open it a crack and peek hopefully out at the main office. I can just glimpse the basket through the window. It's still intact. I feel totally squashed. What's wrong? Why is no one taking any? Maybe I'll just make it absolutely clear that these muffins are for everyone. I head out of my room, into the main open-?plan office. \u201cHi there!\u201d I say brightly. \u201cI just wanted to say, these muffins are from me to all of you. Fresh from the bakery this morning. So... go ahead! Help yourself!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No one answers. No one even acknowledges my presence. Did I suddenly become invisible? \u201cSo, anyway.\u201d I force myself to smile. \u201cEnjoy!\u201d I swivel on my heel and walk out. I've done my bit. If they want the muffins, they want them. If they don't, they don't. End of subject. I really don't care either way. I sit back down at my desk, open a recent financial report, and start running my finger down the relevant columns. After a few moments I lean back, rubbing my eyes with my fists. These figures are just confirming what I already know: the department performance is terrible. Sales went up in the last year by a bit, but they're still far, far too low. We're going to be in real trouble if we don't turn things around. I mentioned it to Byron the other day and he didn't even seem bothered. How can he be so blase? I make a memo on a Post-?it\u201cDiscuss sales with Byron.\u201d Then I put my pen down. Why don't they want my muffins? I was really optimistic when I bought them this morning. I imagined everyone's faces lighting up at the sight, and people saying \u201cWhat a nice thought, Lexi. Thanks!\u201d But now I'm crestfallen. They must totally hate me. I mean, you'd have to loathe someone to refuse a muffin, wouldn't you? And these are really deluxe ones. They're fat and fresh and the blueberry ones have even got lemon icing on them. A tiny, sensible voice in my head is telling me to leave it.</p><p>Forget about it. It's only a basket of muffins, for God's sake. But I can't. I can't just sit here. On impulse I leap to my feet again and head into the main office. There's the basket, still untouched. Everyone is typing away or on the phone, ignoring both me and the muffins. \u201cSo!\u201d I try to sound relaxed. \u201cNobody wants a muffin? They're really nice ones!\u201d \u201cMuffin?\u201d Fi says at last, her brow wrinkled. \u201cI can't see any muffins.\u201d She looks around the office as though baffled. \u201cAnyone seen any muffins?\u201d Everyone shrugs, as though equally baffled. \u201cDo you mean an English muffin?\u201d Carolyn's brow is wrinkled. \u201cOr a French muffin?\u201d \u201cThey do muffins at Starbucks. I could send out if you like,\u201d Debs says, barely hiding her giggles. Ha-?ha. Really funny. \u201cFine!\u201d I say, trying to hide my hurt. \u201cIf you want to be childish about it, then that's fine. Just forget it. I was only trying to be nice.\u201d Breathing hard, I stalk out again. I can hear the sniggers and giggles behind me, but I try to block my ears. I have to keep my dignity; I have to be calm and bosslike. I mustn't rise. I mustn't react. Oh God. I can't help it. Hurt and anger are rising through me like a volcano. How can they be so mean? \u201cActually, it's not fine.\u201d I march back into the office, my face burning. \u201cLook, I went to a lot of time and trouble to get these muffins, because I thought it would be nice to give you a treat, and now you're pretending you can't even see them...\u201d \u201cI'm sorry, Lexi.\u201d Fi appears blank and apologetic. \u201cI honestly don't know what you're talking about.\u201d Carolyn snorts with laughterand something inside me snaps. \u201cI'm talking about this!\u201d I grab a chocolate-?chip muffin and brandish it at Fi's face, and she shrinks away. \u201cIt's a muffin! It's a bloody muffin! Well, fine! If you're not going to eat it, then I will!\u201d I stuff the muffin into my mouth and 237 start chewing it furiously, then take another bite. Huge crumbs are falling all over the floor, but I don't care. \u201cIn fact, I'll eat all of them!\u201d I add. \u201cWhy not?\u201d I grab an iced blueberry muffin and cram that in my mouth too. \u201cMmm, yum!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLexi?\u201d I turn and my insides shrivel up. Simon Johnson and Byron are standing at the door to the office. Byron looks like he wants to burst with delight. Simon's regarding me as though I'm the crazy gorilla throwing its food around at the zoo.</p><p>\u201cS-?Simon!\u201d I splutter muffin crumbs in horror. \u201cUm... hi! How are you?\u201d \u201cI just wanted a quick word, if you're not...busy?\u201d Simon raises his eyebrows.</p> <p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d I smooth my hair down, desperately trying to swallow my mouthful. \u201cCome through to my office.\u201d As I pass by the glass door I catch my reflection and wince at my eyes, all red from tiredness. My hair looks a bit all over the place too. Maybe I should have put it up. Oh well, nothing I can do about it now. \u201cSo, Lexi,\u201d Simon says as I close the door and dump my half-?eaten muffins on the desk. \u201cI just had a good meeting with Byron about June '07. I'm sure he's been filling you in on developments.\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d I nod, trying to look like I know what he's referring to. But \u201cJune '07\u201d means absolutely nothing to me. Is something happening then? \u201cI'm scheduling in a final decision meeting for Monday. I won't say any more just now. Obviously discretion is crucial \u201d Simon breaks off, his forehead suddenly furrowed. \u201cI know you've had reservations, Lexi. We all have. But really, there are no more options.\u201d 238 What's he talking about? What? \u201cWell, Simon, I'm sure we can work it out,\u201d I bluff, desperately hoping he won't ask me to elaborate. \u201cGood girl, Lexi. Knew you'd come around.\u201d He raises his voice again, sounding more cheerful. \u201cI'm seeing James Garrison later on, the new guy at Southeys. What do you make of him?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thank God. At last, something I've heard of. \u201cAh yes,\u201d I say briskly. \u201cWell, unfortunately I gather Southeys isn't up to scratch, Simon. We'll have to look elsewhere for a distributor.\u201d \u201cI beg to differ, Lexi!\u201d Byron cuts in with a laugh. \u201cSoutheys has just offered us an improved rate and service package.\u201d He turns to Simon. \u201cI was with them all day last week, along with Keith from Soft Furnishings. James Garrison has turned the place around. We were impressed.\u201d My face is burning. Bastard. \u201cLexi, don't you agree with Byron?\u201d Simon turns to me in surprise. \u201cHave you met James Garrison?\u201d \u201cI...um...no, I haven't.\u201d I swallow. \u201cI'm...I'm sure you're right, Byron.\u201d He has completely shafted me. On purpose. There's a horrible pause. I can see Simon regarding me with puzzled disappointment. \u201cRight,\u201d he says at last. \u201cWell, I must be off. Good to see you, Lexi.\u201d \u201cBye, Simon.\u201d I usher him out of my office, trying my best to sound confident and senior-?management-?like. \u201cLook forward to catching up again soon. Maybe we can do that lunch sometime...\u201d \u201cHey, Lexi,\u201d Byron says suddenly, gesturing at my bum. \u201cThere's something on your skirt.\u201d I grope behind me, and find myself peeling off a Post-?it. I look at itand the ground seems to swivel beneath me like quicksand. Someone's printed, in pink felt-?tip: I fancy Simon Johnson. I can't look at Simon Johnson. My head feels like it's about to explode. Byron snorts with laughter. \u201cThere's another one.\u201d He jerks his head and numbly I peel off a second Post-?it: Simon, do it to me! \u201cJust a silly prank!\u201d I crumple up the Post-?its desperately. \u201cThe staff having a bit of... fun\u201d Simon Johnson doesn't look amused. \u201cRight,\u201d he says after a pause. \u201cWell, I'll see you, Lexi.\u201d He turns on his heel and heads away, down the corridor, with Byron. After a moment I hear Byron saying, \u201cSimon, now do you see? She's absolutely...\u201d</p><p>I stand there, watching them go, still quivering in shock. That's it. My career's ruined before I've even had a chance to try it out. In a daze I walk back into my office and sink into my chair. I can't do this job. I'm knackered. Byron's shafted me. No one wants my muffins.</p><p>At that last thought I feel an enormous pang of hurt and then suddenly I can't help it, a tear is running down my face. I bury my face in my arms and soon I'm convulsing with sobs. I thought it was going to be so great. I thought being boss would be fun and exciting. I never realized... I never thought... \u201cHi.\u201d A voice pierces my thoughts and I raise my head to see Fi standing just inside the doorway. \u201cOh. Hi.\u201d I wipe my eyes roughly. \u201cSorry. I was just...\u201d \u201cAre you okay?\u201d she says awkwardly. \u201cI'm fine. Fine.\u201d I scrabble in my desk drawer for a tissue and blow my nose. \u201cCan I do anything for you?\u201d \u201cSorry about the Post-?its.\u201d She bites her lip. \u201cWe never 240 thought Simon would come down. It was just supposed to be a laugh.\u201d \u201c 'S all right.\u201d My voice is shaky. \u201cYou weren't to know.\u201d \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d \u201cHe wasn't impressed.\u201d I sigh. \u201cBut he's not impressed with me anyway, so what's the difference?\u201d I tear off a bit of chocolate-?chip muffin, stuff it in my mouth, and feel immediately better. For about a nanosecond. Fi is just staring at me. \u201cI thought you didn't eat carbs anymore,\u201d she says at last. \u201cYeah, right. Like I could live without chocolate.\u201d I take another massive bite of muffin. \u201cWomen need chocolate. It's a scientific fact.\u201d There's silence, and I look up to see Fi still gazing at me uncertainly. \u201cIt's so strange,\u201d she says. \u201cYou sound like the old Lexi.\u201d \u201cI am the old Lexi.\u201d I feel suddenly weary at having to explain all over again. \u201cFi... imagine you woke up tomorrow and it was suddenly 2010. And you had to slot into some new life and be some new person. Well, that's what this is like for me.\u201c I break off another piece of muffin and survey it for a few moments, then put it down again. \u201dAnd I don't recognize the new person. I don't know why she is like she is. And it's kind of... it's hard.\u201d</p><p>There's a long silence. I'm staring fixedly at the desk, breathing hard, crumbling the muffin into little pieces. I don't dare look up, in case Fi says something else sarcastic or laughs at me and I burst into tears again.</p> <p>\u201cLexi, I'm sorry.\u201d When she speaks, her voice is so quiet, I barely hear it. \u201cI didn't... we didn't realize. I mean, you don't look any different.\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d I give her a rueful smile. \u201cI look like a brunette Barbie.\u201c I lift a strand of chestnut hair and let it fall. \u201dWhen I saw myself in the mirror in hospital, I nearly died of shock. I didn't know who I was.\u201c \u201dLook...\u201c She's chewing her lip and twisting her bangles. \u201dI'm sorry. About the muffins, and the Post-?its and... everything. Why don't you have lunch with us today?\u201c She comes toward the desk with a sudden eagerness. \u201dLet's start again.\u201c \u201dThat'd be nice.\u201c I give her a grateful smile. \u201dBut I can't today. I'm seeing Loser Dave for lunch.\u201c \u201dLoser Dave?\u201c She sounds so shocked, I can't help laughing. \u201dWhy are you seeing him? Lexi, you're not thinking of\u201c \u201dNo! Of course not! I'm just trying to work out what's happened in my life during the last three years. Put the pieces together.\u201c I hesitate, suddenly realizing that Fi probably has the answers to all my questions. \u201dFi, do you know how it ended with me and Loser Dave?\u201c \u201dNo idea.\u201c Fi shrugs. \u201dYou never told us how you broke up. You shut us all out. Even me. It was like...all you cared about was your career. So in the end we stopped trying.\u201c I can see a flicker of hurt in her face. \u201dI'm sorry, Fi,\u201c I say awkwardly. \u201dI didn't mean to shut you out. At least, I don't think I did \u201d It's surreal, apologizing for something I have no memory of. Like I'm a werewolf or something. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon't worry. It wasn't you. I mean, it was you but it wasn't you \u201d Fi trails off.

I reach behind and 242 pull off yet another Post-?it. It reads Simon Johnson: I would. \u201cI so wouldn't,\u201d I say, crumpling it. \u201cWouldn't you?\u201d Fi grins wickedly. \u201cI would.\u201d \u201cNo, you wouldn't!\u201d I can't help a giggle at her expression. \u201cI reckon he's quite fit.\u201d \u201cHe's ancient! He probably can't even do it anymore.\u201d I catch her eye and suddenly we're both laughing helplessly, like in the old days. I drop my jacket and sit on the arm of the sofa, clutching my stomach, unable to stop. I don't think I've laughed like this since the accident. It's like all my strains and tensions are coming out; everything's being laughed away. \u201cGod, I've missed you,\u201d Fi says at last, still gulping. \u201cI've missed you too.\u201d I take a deep breath, trying to collect my thoughts. \u201cFi, really. I'm sorry for whatever I was like... or whatever I did\u201d \u201cDon't be a sap.\u201d Fi cuts me off kindly but firmly, handing me my jacket. \u201cGo and see Loser Dave.\u201d Loser Dave's done really well for himself, it turns out. I mean, really well. He now works for Auto Repair Workshop at their head office, and has some quite senior sales role. As he gets out of the lift, he's all dapper in a pin-?striped suit, with much longer hair than the buzz cut he used to have, and rimless glasses. I can't help jumping up from my seat in the lobby and exclaiming, \u201cLoser Dave! Look at you!\u201d Immediately he winces, and looks warily around the lobby. \u201cNo one calls me Loser Dave anymore,\u201d he snaps in a low voice. \u201cI'm David, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Sorry... e r . . . David. Not Butch?\u201d I can't resist adding, and he shoots me a glare. His paunch has disappeared too, I notice as he leans against the foyer desk to talk to the receptionist. He must be working out properly these days, as opposed to his old routine, which was five heaves of a dumbbell, followed by cracking open a beer and turning on the soccer. Now I look back, I can't believe I put up with him. Scuzzy boxer shorts littered over his flat. Crude, antifeminist jokes. Complete paranoia that I was desperate to trap him into marriage and three kids and domestic drudgery. I mean. He should be so lucky. \u201cYou're looking good, Lexi.\u201d As he turns away from the reception desk he eyes me up and down. \u201cIt's been a while. Saw you on the telly, of course. That Ambition show. Kind of program I might have wanted to take part in once.\u201d He shoots me a pitying glance. \u201cBut I've leapfrogged over that level now. I'm on the fast track. Shall we go?\u201d I'm sorry, I just can't take Loser Dave seriously as \u201cDavid the fast-?track businessman.\u201d We head out of the office toward what Loser Dave calls a \u201cgood local eatery,\u201d and all the while he's on his phone, talking loudly about \u201cdeals\u201d and \u201cmill,\u201d his eyes constantly sliding toward me. \u201cWow,\u201d I say as he puts his phone away at last. \u201cYou're really senior now.\u201d \u201cGot a Ford Focus.\u201d He casually shoots his cuffs. \u201cCompany AmEx card. Use of the corporate ski chalet.\u201d \u201cThat's great!\u201d We've reached the restaurant now, which is a small Italian place. We sit down and I lean forward, resting my chin on my hands. Loser Dave seems a bit edgy, fiddling with the plastic menu and endlessly checking his phone. \u201cDavid,\u201d I begin. \u201cI don't know if you got the message about why I wanted to meet up?\u201d 244 \u201cMy secretary told me you wanted to talk over old times?\u201d he says cautiously. \u201cYeah. The thing is, I had this car accident. And I'm trying to piece together my life, work out what happened, talk about our breakup...\u201d Loser Dave sighs. \u201cSweetheart, is this really a good idea, dredging all that up again? We both had our say at the time.\u201c \u201dDredging up all what?\u201c \u201dYou know...\u201c He looks around and catches the eye of a nearby lounging waiter. \u201dCould we get some service here? Some vino? Bottle of house red, please.\u201c \u201dBut I don't know! I have no idea what happened!\u201c I lean farther forward, trying to get his attention. \u201dI have amnesia. Didn't your secretary explain? I don't remember anything.\u201c Very slowly Loser Dave turns back and stares at me, as though suspecting a joke. \u201dYou've got amnesia?\u201c \u201dYes! I've been in hospital, everything.\u201c \u201dFuck me.\u201c He shakes his head as a waiter comes over and goes through the rigamarole of pouring and tasting. \u201dSo you don't remember anything?\u201c \u201dNothing from the last three years. And what I want to know is, why did we split? Did something happen... or did we drift apart... or what?\u201c Loser Dave doesn't answer straightaway. He's eyeing me over his glass. \u201dSo is there anything you do remember?\u201c \u201dThe last thing is the night before my dad's funeral. I was in this nightclub, and I was really pissed off with you because you didn't turn u p . . . and then I fell down some steps in the rain And that's all I remember.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d He's nodding thoughtfully. \u201cI remember that night. Well, in fact... that's why we split up.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d I say, puzzled. \u201cBecause I never turned up. You chucked me. Finito.\u201d He takes a gulp of wine, visibly relaxing. \u201cReally?\u201d I say, astonished. \u201cI chucked you?\u201d \u201cNext morning. You'd had enough, so that was it. We were over.\u201d I frown as I try to imagine the scene. \u201cSo, did we have a big row?\u201d \u201cNot so much a row,\u201d Loser Dave says after a moment's consideration. \u201cMore like a mature discussion. We agreed it was right to end things and you said you might be making the biggest mistake in the world, but you couldn't stop your jealous, possessive nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say dubiously. \u201cYeah. I offered to come along to your dad's funeral, show support, but you turned me down, said you couldn't bear the sight of me.\u201d He takes a gulp of wine. \u201cI didn't bear you a grudge, though. I said, 'Lexi, I will always care for you. Whatever you want, I want.' I gave you a single rose and a final kiss. Then I walked away. It was beautiful.\u201d I put my glass down and survey him. His gaze is as open and blameless as it used to be when he conned customers into taking extra-?premium total-?scam insurance on their cars. \u201cSo that's exactly what happened?\u201d I say. \u201cWord for word.\u201d He picks up the menu. \u201cFancy some garlic bread?\u201d Is it my imagination or does he seem a whole lot more cheerful since he's heard I have amnesia? 246 \u201cLoser Dave... is that really what happened?\u201d I give him my severest, most penetrating look. \u201cOf course,\u201d he says in an injured tone. \u201cAnd stop calling me Loser Dave.\u201d \u201cSorry.\u201d I sigh, and start unwrapping a bread stick. Maybe he's telling the truth. Or a Loser-?Dave version of it, at least. Maybe I did chuck him. I was certainly pissed off with him. \u201cSo... did anything else happen back then?\u201d I snap the bread stick in two and start nibbling it. \u201cIs there anything you can remember? Like, why did I suddenly get so careeroriented? Why did I shut my friends out? What was going on in my head?\u201d \u201cSearch me.\u201d Loser Dave is perusing the specials menu. \u201cD'you fancy sharing the lasagne for two?\u201d \u201cIt's all just s o . . . confusing.\u201d I rub my brow. \u201cI feel like I've been plonked in the middle of a map, with one of those big arrows pointing to me. 'You Are Here.' And what I want to know is, how did I get here?\u201d At last Loser Dave lifts his eyes from the specials menu. \u201cWhat you want is GPS,\u201d he says, like the Dalai Lama making a pronouncement on top of a mountain.</p><p>\u201cThat's it! Exactly!\u201d I lean forward eagerly. \u201cI feel lost. And if I could just trace the path, if I could navigate back somehow...\u201d Loser Dave is nodding wisely. \u201cI can do you a deal.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d I say, not understanding.</p><p>\u201cI can do you a deal on GPS.\u201d He taps his nose. \u201cWe're branching out at Auto Repair.\u201d For a moment I think I might explode with frustration. \u201cI don't literally need GPS!\u201d I almost yell. \u201cIt's a metaphor! Me-?ta-?phor!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight, right. Yeah, of course.\u201d Loser Dave nods, his brow furrowed as though he's digesting my words and mulling them over. \u201cIs that a built-?in system?\u201d I don't believe it. Did I actually go out with this guy? \u201cYeah, that's right,\u201d I say finally. \u201cHonda makes it. Let's have the garlic bread.\u201d When I arrive home later, I'm planning to ask Eric what he knows about my breakup with Loser Dave. We must have talked about all our old relationships, surely. But when I walk into the loft, I sense straightaway that this isn't the moment. He's striding around, on the phone, looking stressed. \u201cCome on, Lexi.\u201d He puts his hand briefly over the phone. \u201cWe'll be late.\u201d \u201cFor what?\u201d \u201cFor what?\u201d echoes Eric, looking as though I've asked him what gravity is. \u201cFor the launch!\u201d Shit. It's the Blue 42 launch party tonight. I did know that; it just slipped my mind. \u201cOf course,\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cI'll just go and get ready.\u201d \u201cShouldn't your hair be up?\u201d Eric casts a critical eye over me. \u201cIt looks unprofessional.\u201d \u201cOh. Er...right. Yes.\u201d Totally flustered, I change into a black silk tailored suit, put on my highest black pumps, and quickly shove my hair up into its chignon. I accessorize with diamonds, then turn to survey myself. Aargh. I look so boring. Like an actuary or something. I need... something else. Don't I have any brooches anymore? Or any silk flowers or scarves or sparkly hair clips? 248 Anything fun? I root around for a bit in my drawers, but can't find anything except a plain quilted beige hair band. Great. That's a real style statement. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReady?\u201d Eric strides in. \u201cYou look fine. Let's go.\u201d Jeez Louise. I've never seen him so tense and hyper before. All the way there, he's on the phone, and when at last he puts it away, he taps his fingers on it, staring out the car window. \u201cI'm sure it'll go really well,\u201d I say encouragingly. \u201cIt has to,\u201d he says without turning toward me. \u201cThis is our big sales push. Lots of ultra-?highs. Lots of press. This is where we turn Blue 42 into the talk of the city.\u201d As we turn in at the entrance gates I can't help gasping. Burning torches lead the way to the front doors. Lasers are sweeping the night sky. There's a red carpet for guests to walk down and even a couple of photographers waiting. It looks like a film premiere. \u201cEric, this is amazing.\u201d Impulsively I squeeze his hand. \u201cIt's going to be a triumph.\u201d \u201cLet's hope.\u201d For the first time Eric turns to give me a quick, tight smile. The driver opens my door, and I pick up my bag to leave. \u201cOh, Lexi.\u201d Eric is feeling in his pocket. \u201cBefore I forget. I've been meaning to give you this.\u201d He hands me a piece of paper. \u201cWhat's this?\u201d I smile as I unfold it. Then my smile kind of melts away. It's an invoice. At the top is Eric's name, but he's crossed it out and written \u201cAssigned to Lexi Gardiner.\u201d I scan the words in disbelief. Chelsea Bridge Glass Objets. Large Blown Leopard: quantity 1. To pay: \u00a33,200. \u201cI ordered a replacement,\u201d Eric is saying. \u201cYou can settle up anytime. Check is fine, or just put a transfer into my bank account...\u201d</p><p>He's invoicing me? \u201cYou want me to pay for the leopard?\u201d I force a little laugh, just to see if he's joking. \u201cOut of my own money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you broke it.\u201d Eric sounds surprised. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d \u201cNo! That's... that's fine.\u201d I swallow. \u201cI'll write you a check. As soon as we get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo hurry.\u201d Eric smiles, and gestures at the waiting driver, holding the door. \u201cWe'd better get going.\u201d It's fine, I tell myself firmly. It's fair for him to invoice me. It's obviously how our marriage works. That's not how a marriage should work. No. Stop it. It's fine. It's lovely. I stuff the paper into my bag and smile as brightly as I can at the driver, then get out and follow Eric along the red carpet.</p> <p>Chapter 14</p><p>Bloody hell- This is a real, serious, glitzy party. The whole building is alive with light and thudding music. The penthouse loft looks even more spectacular than before, with flowers everywhere, and waiters in cool black outfits holding trays of champagne, and gift bags ready for people to take. Ava and Jon and a few other people I don't recognize, are gathered by the window, and Eric strides straight over to them. \u201cPeople,\u201d he says. \u201cHave we done the rundown on the guests? Sarah, you've got the press list? All under control?\u201c \u201dThey're here.\u201c A young girl in a wrap dress comes hurrying in, almost tripping over her stilettos. \u201dThe van Gogens are early. And they've brought friends. And there's another lot right behind them!\u201c \u201dGood luck, guys.\u201c Eric is high-?fiving his entire team. \u201dLet's sell this building.\u201d</p><p>The next moment a couple in expensive-?looking coats enters, and Eric springs into full-?charm of 251 fensive, ushering them to meet Ava, handing them champagne, and taking them over to see the view. More people are arriving, and soon there's a small crowd chattering and leafing through the brochure and eyeing the waterfall. Jon is about ten yards away, to my left, wearing a dark suit, frowning as he talks to the van Gogens. I haven't spoken to him yet. I have no idea if he's noticed me. Occasionally I glance over at him, then quickly look away as my stomach pops over. It's like I'm thirteen again and he's my crush. All I'm aware of in this entire roomful of people is him. Where he is, what he's doing, who he's talking to. I dart another glance at him and this time he meets my eye. Cheeks flaming, I turn away and swig my wine. Great, Lexi. Not at all obvious. Deliberately, I swivel right away so he's out of my line of vision. I'm watching everyone arrive, almost in a trance, when Eric arrives beside me. \u201cLexi, darling.\u201d He has a fixed, disapproving smile. \u201cYou look awkward, standing there on your own. Come with me.\u201d Before I can stop him, he's leading me firmly over to Jon, who's talking to another rich-?looking couple. The woman is in a Dior-?print trouser suit, with dyed red hair and severely overdone lipliner. She bares her porcelain teeth at me, and her gray-?haired husband grunts, his hand clamped possessively on her shoulder. \u201cLet me introduce my wife, Lexi.\u201d Eric beams at them. \u201cOne of the greatest fans of\u201dhe pauses, and I tense up, waiting for it\u201cloft-?style living!\u201d</p><p>If I hear that phrase one more time I'm going to shoot myself. 252 \u201cHi, Lexi.\u201d Jon meets my eye briefly as Eric heads off again. \u201cHow are you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI'm fine, thanks, Jon.\u201d I try to sound calm, like he's any other person at the party; like I haven't been fixating on him since I arrived. I turn to the Dior woman. \u201cSo... how do you like the loft?\u201d</p><p>The couple exchange doubtful glances. \u201cWe have one concern,\u201d says the man, in a European accent I can't quite place. \u201cThe space. Whether it is big enough.\u201d I'm stumped. This place is like a bloody aircraft hangar. How can it not be big enough?</p><p>\u201cWe think five thousand square feet is a generous size,\u201d says Jon. \u201cHowever, you could knock two or even three units together if you need a larger space.\u201d \u201cOur other problem is the design,\u201d says the man.</p><p>\u201cThe design?\u201d echoes Jon politely. \u201cIs something wrong with the design?\u201d \u201cAt our home we have touches of gold,\u201d says the man. \u201cGold paintings. Gold lamps. Gold...\u201d He seems to run out of steam.</p> <p>\u201cCarpets,\u201d the woman puts in, rolling the \u201crrr\u201d heavily. \u201cGold carrr-?pets.\u201d The man jabs at the brochure. \u201cHere I see a lot of silver. Chrome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Jon nods, deadpan. \u201cWell, obviously the loft can be customized to your own individual taste. We could, for example, have the fireplace gold-?plated.\u201d \u201cA gold-?plated fireplace?\u201d says the woman uncertainly. \u201cWould that b e . . . too much?\u201d \u201cIs there such a thing as too much gold?\u201d Jon replies pleasantly. \u201cWe could also add solid gold light-?fittings. And Lexi could help you with the gold carpet. Couldn't you Lexi?\u201d 253 \u201cOf course.\u201d I nod, praying desperately I don't suddenly snort with laughter. \u201cYes. Well, we will think about it.\u201d The couple moves off, talking in some foreign language I don't recognize. Jon knocks back his drink.</p><p>\u201cNot big enough. Jesus Christ. Ten of our units at Ridgeway would fit into this space.\u201d \u201cWhat's Ridgeway?\u201d \u201cOur affordable-?housing project.\u201d He sees my blank look. \u201cWe only get planning permission for a place like this if we put up some affordable units.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d I say in surprise. \u201cEric's never even mentioned affordable housing.\u201d A flicker of amusement passes over Jon's face. \u201cI'd say his heart isn't totally in that aspect of the job,\u201d he says, as Eric steps up onto a small podium in front of the mantelpiece. The ambient lighting dims, a spotlight falls on Eric and gradually the hum of chatter dies away. \u201cWelcome!\u201d he says, his voice ringing out around the space. \u201cWelcome to Blue 42, the latest in the Blue series of projects dedicated t o . . .\u201d I hold my breath. Please don't say it, please don't say it... \u201cLoft-?style living!\u201d His hands sweep along and all the members of his staff applaud vigorously. Jon glances at me and takes a step back, away from the crowd. After a moment I move back too, my eyes fixed firmly ahead. My whole body is crackling with apprehension. And... excitement. \u201cSo, have you remembered anything yet?\u201d he says in a casual undertone. \u201cNo.\u201d Behind Eric, a massive screen is lighting up with images 254 of lofts from all angles. Punchy music fills the air and the room becomes even darker. I have to hand it to Ericthis is a fantastic presentation. \u201cYou know, we first met each other at a loft launch like this one.\u201c Jon's voice is so low, I can barely hear it above the music. \u201dThe minute you spoke I knew.\u201c \u201dKnew what?\u201c \u201dKnew I liked you.\u201d</p><p>I'm silent for a few moments, curiosity prickling at me. \u201cWhat did I say?\u201d I whisper back at last. \u201cYou said, 'If I hear that phrase loft-?style living again, I'm going to shoot myself.'\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d I stare at him, then splutter with laughter. A man in front turns around with a frown, and as if in synch, Jon and I back away a few more paces, till we're right in the shadows. \u201cYou shouldn't be hiding away,\u201d I say. \u201cThis is your moment. Your loft.\u201d \u201cYeah, well,\u201d he says dryly. \u201cI'll let Eric take the glory. He's welcome to it.\u201d For a few moments we watch Eric onscreen in a hard hat, striding over a building site. \u201cYou make no sense,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cIf you think lofts are for rich wankers, why do you design them?\u201d \u201cThat's a good question.\u201d Jon takes a gulp of his drink. \u201cTruth is, I should move on. But I like Eric. He believed in me, he gave me my first chance, he runs a great company....\u201d \u201cYou like Eric?\u201d I shake my head in disbelief. \u201cOf course you do. That's why you keep telling me to leave him.\u201d \u201cI do. He's a great guy. He's honest, he's loyal...\u201d For a while Jon's silent beside me, his eyes flickering in the dim light. \u201cI don't want to fuck Eric's life up,\u201d he says finally. \u201cIt wasn't in the plan.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo why...\u201d \u201cHe doesn't understand you.\u201d Jon looks directly at me. \u201cHe has no idea who you are.\u201d \u201cAnd you do, I suppose?\u201d I retort, just as the lights come up and applause breaks out around the room. Instinctively I take a step away from Jon, and we both watch as Eric mounts the podium again, glowing with an aura of success and money and on-?top-?of-?the-?world-?ness. \u201cSo, have you encountered Mont Blanc yet?\u201d Jon says, clapping vigorously, his mood lighter.</p><p>\u201cWhat's Mont Blanc?\u201d I give him a suspicious glance. \u201cYou'll find out.\u201d \u201cTell me.\u201d \u201cNo, no.\u201d He shakes his head, pressing his mouth together as though trying not to laugh. \u201cI couldn't spoil the surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me!\u201d \u201cJon! There you are. Emergency!\u201d We both start in surprise as Ava appears behind us. She's dressed in a black trouser suit, holding a burlap sack, and appears flustered. \u201cThe ornamental rocks for the master bedroom fish tank have only just arrived from Italy. But I've got to see to the kitchen place-?settingssome fucking idiot's been fiddling with themso can you do it?\u201d She shoves the burlap sack into Jon's arms. \u201cJust arrange the rocks in the tank. There should be time before the presentation finishes.\u201d \u201cNo problem.\u201d Jon hefts the sack in his arms, then looks at me, his eyes opaque and impenetrable. \u201cLexi, want to come with me and help?\u201d My throat tightens up so hard, I can't breathe. This is an invitation. A challenge. No. I have to say no. \u201cUm... yes.\u201d I swallow. \u201cSure.\u201d 256 I feel almost light-?headed as I follow Jon through the crowd, up the stairs onto the mezzanine level, and into the bedroom. No one even notices us. All attention is on the presentation. We head into the main bedroom and Jon closes the door. \u201cSo,\u201d he says. \u201cLook.\u201d My voice is sharp with nerves. \u201cI can't carry on like this! All this whispering, creeping around, trying t o . . . to sabotage my marriage. I'm happy with Eric!\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cYou won't be with him in a year.\u201d He sounds so sure of himself, I'm nettled. \u201cYes, I will,\u201d I shoot back. \u201cI expect I'll be with him in fifty years!\u201d \u201cYou'll try your best, you'll try to mold yourself... but your spirit's too free for him. At last you won't be able to stand it anymore.\u201d He exhales, pressing his meshed hands outward. \u201cI've watched it happen once. I don't want to see it again.\u201d \u201cThanks for the warning,\u201d I snap. \u201cWell, when it does happen, I'll give you a call, how's that? We should do the rocks.\u201d I jerk my head toward the sack, but Jon ignores me. He puts it down on the floor and comes toward me, his eyes intense and questioning. \u201cYou really, really don't remember anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say almost wearily. \u201cFor the millionth time, I don't remember anything.\u201d He's only inches away from me now, studying my face, searching for something. \u201cAll the time we spent together, all the things we said There has to be something to trigger your memory.\u201d He briefly rubs his brow, frowning. \u201cDo sunflowers mean anything to you?\u201d</p> <p>In spite of myself I rack my brain. Sunflowers. Sunflowers. Didn't I once...</p><p>No, it's gone. \u201cNothing,\u201d I say at last. \u201cI mean, I like sunflowers, but...\u201d \u201ce.e. cummings? Mustard on fries?\u201d \u201cI don't know what you're talking about,\u201d I say helplessly. \u201cNone of this means anything to me.\u201d He's so close I can feel his gentle breath on my skin. His eyes haven't left mine. \u201cDoes this mean anything to you?\u201d He's moved his hands up to my face, cradling my cheeks, rubbing my skin with his thumbs. \u201cNo.\u201d I swallow. \u201cThis?\u201d He leans down and brushes a kiss against my neck. \u201cStop it,\u201d I say feebly, but I can barely get the words out. And besides, I don't mean them. My breathing is getting shorter and shorter. I've forgotten about everything else. I want to kiss him. I want to kiss him in a way I didn't want to kiss Eric. And then it's happeninghis mouth is on mine and my entire body's telling me this is the right thing to do. He smells right. He tastes right. He feels right. I can feel his arms wrapping themselves tightly around me; the roughness of his five-?o'clock shadow. My eyes are closed, I'm losing myself, this is so right \u201cJon?\u201d Ava's voice comes through the door and it's like someone electrocuted me. I fly away from Jon, tripping over my wobbly legs, cursing under my breath, \u201cFuck!\u201d \u201cShh!\u201d He looks thrown too. \"Stay cool. Hi, Ava.</p><p>What's up?\u201c Rocks. Yes. That's what we're supposed to be doing. I grab the sack and start pulling rocks out, chucking them into the fish tank as fast as I can with a series of splashes. 258 The poor fish are swimming about like lunatics, but I don't have any choice. \u201dEverything okay?\u201c Ava puts her head around the door. \u201dI'm about to lead a party of guests up here for the tour...\u201c \u201dNo problem,\u201c Jon says reassuringly. \u201dNearly done.\u201c As soon as Ava disappears, he kicks the door shut and comes back to me. \u201dLexi.\u201c He grasps my face as though he wants to devour me, or hug me, or maybe both. \u201dIf you only knew, this has been torture...\u201c \u201dStop it!\u201c I draw away, my mind spinning like a kaleidoscope. \u201dI'm married! We can't You can't just\u201c I gasp and clap a hand to my mouth. \u201dOh shit. Shit!\u201c I'm not looking at Jon anymore. I'm looking at the fish tank. \u201dWhat?\u201c Jon stares, uncomprehending, then follows my gaze. \u201dOh. Oops.\u201c The tank has quieted down. All the tropical fish are swimming peacefully among the marble rocks. Except one blue stripy one, which is floating on top. \u201dI've killed a fish!\u201c I let out a horrified giggle. \u201dI've brained it with one of the rocks.\u201c \u201dSo you have,\u201c Jon says, going over to survey the tank. \u201dNice aim.\u201c \u201dBut it cost three hundred pounds! What am I going to do? The guests will be in here any moment!\u201c \u201dThat's pretty bad feng shui.\u201c Jon grins. \u201dOkay, I'll go and delay Ava. You flush it away.\" He reaches for my hand and holds it a moment. \u201cWe haven't finished.\u201d He kisses the tips of my fingersthen heads out of the room, leaving me alone with the tank. Wincing, I reach into the warm water and pick up the fish by the very edge of its fin. \u201cI'm really sorry,\u201d I say in a tiny voice. Trying to catch the dripping water with my other hand, I hurry into the high-?tech bathroom. I drop the fish in the gleaming white loo and look for the flush. There isn't one. This must be an intelligent loo. \u201cFlush,\u201d I say aloud, waving my arms to set off the sensors. \u201cFlush!\u201d Nothing happens. \u201cFlush!\u201d I say, with more desperation. \u201cGo on, flush!\u201d But the loo is totally dead. The fish is floating around, looking even more lurid blue against the white porcelain. This cannot be happening. If anything is going to put a customer off a high-?end luxury apartment, it's a dead fish in the loo. I pull out my phone from my pocket and scroll down my contacts until I find J. That must be him. I press speed-?dial, and a moment later he answers. \u201cJon here.\u201d \u201cThe fish is in the loo!\u201d I hiss. \u201cBut I can't flush it!\u201d \u201cThe sensors should set it off automatically.\u201d \u201cI know! But they're not setting anything off! There's a dead blue fish staring up at me! What am I going to do?\u201d \u201cIt's fine. Go to the panel next to the bed. You can override it and flush it from there. Hey, Eric! How are you doing?\u201d The phone abruptly cuts off. I hurry over to the bed and locate a flip-?down panel set into the wall. A scary digital display blinks back at me and I can't help a small moan. How can anyone live in a house that's more complicated than NASA? Why does a house have to be intelligent, anyway? Why can't it be nice and stupid? My fingers fumbling, I press Menu, then Override, then Options. I scan down the list. Temperature... Lighting... Where's Bathroom? Where's Flush Loo? Do I even have the right panel? Suddenly I notice another flip-?up panel on the other side 260 of the bed. Maybe that's it. I rush to it, wrench it open, and start jabbing at random. In a minute I'm going to have to scoop the stupid fish out of the water with my bare hands A sound draws me up short. It's a wail. A kind of distant siren. What on earth... I stop jabbing and look more carefully at the panel I've been hitting. It's flashing words at me in red. Panic Alert Secure Space. A sudden movement from the window attracts my attention and I look up to see a metal grille descending steadily over the glass. What the Frantically I jab again at the panel, but it flashes back at me Unauthorized, then returns to Panic AlertSecure Space. Oh... my God. What have I done? I dart to the door of the bedroom and look down to the space below. I don't believe it. It's mayhem. The siren is even louder out here. Metal grilles are descending everywhere, over the windows, the paintings, the waterfall. All the rich guests are clinging to each other in the middle of the space like hostages, apart from one portly man who's trapped next to the waterfall. \u201cIs it a robbery? Do they have guns?\u201d a woman in a white trouser suit is exclaiming hysterically, wrenching at her hands. \u201cGeorge, swallow my rings!\u201d \u201cThat's a helicopter!\u201d A gray-?haired man is cocking his ear. \u201cListen! They're on the roof! We're sitting targets!\u201d I'm staring at the scene, my heart hammering, frozen with panic. \u201cIt's coming from the master bedroom!\u201d shouts one of Eric's staff, who has been consulting a panel by the fire 261 place. \u201cSomeone's set off the panic alarm. The police are on their way.\u201d I've ruined the party. Eric will kill me, he'll kill me... And then, with no warning, the noise stops. The sudden quiet is like the sun coming out. \u201cLadies and gentlemen.\u201d A voice comes from the stairs and my head whips around. It's Jon. He's holding a remote control, and he glances briefly up at me before addressing the crowd. \u201cWe hope you enjoyed our security demonstration. Rest assured, we are not under attack from robbers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pauses, and a few people laugh nervously.

I count to threethen plunge my hand in, grab the fish, and, with a shudder, stuff it in my bag. I wash my hands, then head out to see that Eric has taken over from Jon. \u201cFrom this adventure you'll see even more clearly that we at Blue Developments understand you and your concerns better even than you yourselves do,\u201d he's saying. \u201cYou're not our customers... you're our partners in a perfect lifestyle.\u201d He lifts up his glass. \u201cEnjoy your tours.\u201d As he steps aside, a relieved babble of chatter and laughter breaks out. I can see the woman in the white trouser suit grabbing three massive diamond rings back from her husband and pushing them back onto her fingers. 262 I wait a few minutes, then unobtrusively slip down the stairs. I grab a glass of champagne from a passing waiter and take a deep swig. I am never touching any panels again, ever. Or fish. Or loos. \u201cSweetie!\u201d Rosalie's voice makes me jump. She's wearing a skimpy beaded dress in turquoise, and high feathered shoes. \u201cOh my God. Wasn't that genius? That'll make a few diary pieces tomorrow. Everyone's talking about the state-?of-?the-?art security. You know it cost three hundred grand? Just for the system!\u201d Three hundred grand, and the loo doesn't even flush. \u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cGreat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLexi.\u201d Rosalie is giving me a thoughtful look. \u201cSweetie... can I have a little word? About Jon. I saw you talking to him earlier.\u201d I feel suddenly apprehensive. Did she see something? \u201cOh, right!\u201d I aim for a careless tone. \u201cYes, well, he's Eric's architect, so we just got chatting about the design, as you d o . . .\u201d \u201cLexi.\u201d She takes me by the arm and draws me away from the hubbub. \u201cI know you had your bump on the head and everything.\u201d She leans forward. \u201cBut do you remember anything about Jon? From your past?\u201d \u201cUrn... not really.\u201d Rosalie pulls me still nearer. \u201cSweetie, I'm going to give you a bit of a shock,\u201d she says in a low, breathy voice. \u201cA while ago you told me something in confidence. Girlfriend to girlfriend. I didn't say a word to Eric...\u201d I'm transfixed, my fingers frozen around the stem of my champagne flute. Does Rosalie know? \u201cI know this may seem really hard to believe, but something was going on between you and Jon, behind Eric's back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou're joking!\u201d My face is burning. \u201cLike... what, exactly?\u201d \u201cWell, I'm afraid to say....\u201d Rosalie glances around the room and hustles closer. \u201cJon kept pestering you. I just thought I should warn you in case he tried it on again.\u201d For a moment I'm too dumbstruck to reply. Pestering me? \u201cWh-?what do you mean?\u201d I stammer at last. \u201cWhat do you think? He's tried it on with all of us.\u201d Her nose wrinkles disparagingly. \u201cYou mean...\u201d I can't quite process this. \u201cYou mean he's tried it on with you too?\u201d \u201cOh my God, yes.\u201d She rolls her eyes. \u201cHe told me Clive doesn't understand me. Which is true,\u201d she adds after a moment's thought. \u201cClive's a total dimwit. But that doesn't mean I'm going to rush off and be a notch on his bedpost, does it? And he went after Margo, too,\u201d she adds, waving merrily at a woman in green across the room. \u201cSuch a nerve. He said he knew her better than her own husband and she deserved more, and he could tell she was a sensual woman All kinds of ridiculous stuff!\u201c She clicks her tongue dismissively. \u201dMargo's theory is he targets married women and tells them whatever they want to hear. He probably gets some kind of weird kick out of it\u201cShe breaks off as she sees my frozen face. \u201dSweetie! Don't worry. He's like an irritating fly, you just have to swat him away. But he was quite persistent with you. You were, like, the big challenge. You know, being Eric's wife and everything?\u201c She peers at me. \u201dDon't you remember any of this?\u201c Ava walks past us with some guests, and Rosalie beams at them, but I can't move. \u201dNo,\u201c I say at last. \u201dI don't remember any of it. So... what did I do?\u201c 264 \u201dYou kept telling him to leave you alone. It was awkward. You didn't want to wreck his relationship with Eric, you didn't want to rock the boat You were very dignified, sweetie. I would have poured a drink over his head!\u201c She suddenly focuses over my shoulder. \u201dDarling, I must just dash and have a word with Clive about our dinner arrangements. He's booked completely the wrong table, he's an absolute nightmare ...\u201c She breaks off and looks at me again, suddenly anxious. \u201dAre you okay? I just thought I should warn you \u201c \u201dNo.\u201c I come to. \u201dI'm glad you did.\u201c \u201dI mean, I know you'd never fall for his bullshit.\u201c She squeezes my arm. \u201dOf course not!\u201c Somehow I manage to laugh. \u201dOf course I wouldn't!\u201d Rosalie trips away into the party, but my feet are rooted to the ground. I've never felt so humiliated in my life, so gullible, so vain. I believed it all. I fell for his blarney. We've been having a secret affair....I know you better than Eric does It's all bullshit. He took advantage of my memory loss. He flattered me, turned my head. And all he wanted was to get me into bed like a . . . a trophy. I feel hot with mortification. I knew I would never have an affair! I'm not the unfaithful type. I'm just not. I have a decent husband who loves me. And I allowed my head to be swayed. I nearly ruined everything. Well, not anymore. I know where my priorities are. I take a few deep gulps of champagne. Then I lift my head high, walk forward through the crowd until I find Eric, and slip my arm through his. \u201cDarling. The party's going wonderfully. You're brilliant.\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think we've pulled it off.\u201d He looks more relaxed than he has all evening. \u201cNarrow escape with that alarm. Trust Jon to save the day. Hey, there he is! Jon!\u201d I clutch Eric's arm even more tightly as Jon walks toward us. I can't even bear to look at him. Eric claps him on the back and hands him a glass of champagne from a nearby tray. \u201cHere's to you,\u201d he exclaims. \u201cHere's to Jon.\u201d \u201cTo Jon,\u201d I echo tightly, taking the smallest possible sip of champagne. I'm just going to pretend he doesn't exist. I'm going to blank him out. A beep from my bag disturbs my thoughts, and I pull out my phone to see a new message. From Jon. I do not believe this. He's texting me in front of Eric? I quickly press View and the message comes up. Old Canal House in Islington, any evening from 6. We have so much to talk about. I love you. J PS Delete this message. PPS What did you do with the fish?? My face is burning with fury. Rosalie's words ring in my head. You just have to swat him away. \u201cIt's a text from Amy!\u201d I say to Eric, my voice shrill. \u201cI might just quickly reply...\u201d Without looking at Jon, I start texting, my fingers charged up with adrenaline. Yeah. Right. I suppose you thought it was a laugh, taking advantage of the girl who lost her memory. Well, I know your stupid game, okay? I'm a married woman. Leave me alone. 266 I send the text and put my phone away. A moment later Jon frowns at his watch and says casually, \u201cIs that the right time? I think I'm fast.\u201d He takes his cell phone out and squints at the display as though checking, but I can see his thumb moving over the keys and I can see him reading the message and I can see his face jerk with shock.</p><p>Ha. Got him. After a few moments, he seems to recover. \u201cI'm six minutes out,\u201d he says, tapping at the phone. \u201cI'll just change the clock...\u201d I don't know why he's bothering with an excuse. Eric's not even paying any attention. Three seconds later my phone beeps again and I pull it out. \u201cAnother text from Amy,\u201d I say disparagingly. \u201cShe's such a pain.\u201d I dart a glance at Jon as I put my finger on Delete, and his eyes widen with consternation. Huh. Now that I know the truth, it's obvious he's putting it all on. \u201cIs that a good idea?\u201d he says quickly. \u201cDeleting a message without even reading it?\u201d \u201cI'm really not interested.\u201d I shrug. \u201cBut if you haven't read it, you don't know what it says...\u201d \u201cLike I say\u201dI shoot him a sweet smile\u201cI'm not interested.\u201d I press Delete, switch off my phone, and drop it into my bag. \u201cSo!\u201d Eric turns back to us, glowing and ebullient. \u201cThe Clarksons want a repeat viewing tomorrow. I think we have another sale. That's six units, just tonight.\u201d \u201cWell done, my darling, I'm so proud of you!\u201d I exclaim, putting an arm around him in an extravagant gesture. \u201cI love you even more now than I did on our wedding day.\u201d Eric frowns, confused. \u201cBut you don't remember our wedding day. So you don't know how much you loved me.\u201d</p><p>For God's sake. Does he have to be so literal? I try to control my impatience. \u201cWell, however much I loved you then... I love you more now. Much more.\u201d I put my champagne glass down, and with a defiant glance at Jon, pull Eric in for a kiss. The longest, most slurpy, lookhow- much-?I-?love-?my-?husband-?and-?by-?the-?way-?we-?havegreat- sex kiss. At one point Eric tries to draw back, but I clamp tighter, pinning his face to mine. At last, when I think I might suffocate, I release him, wipe my mouth with the back of my hand, and look around the emptying room. Jon has gone.</p><p>Chapter 15</p> <p>My marriage. That's my priority. From now on I'm going to focus on my relationship with Eric, and nothing else. I'm still a bit shaken the next morning, as I go into the kitchen for breakfast and take the jug of green juice out of the fridge. I must have been crazy last night. I have the dream husband, handed to me on a plate. Why would I jeopardize that? Why would I kiss some guy in the back bedroom, whatever his story was? I pour a little green juice into a glass and swirl it around to look like dregs, which is what I do every morning. (I can't drink that pond-?weed stuff. But neither can I disappoint Eric, who thinks green juice is almost as great as loft-?style living.) Then I take a boiled egg from the pan and pour myself a cup of tea from the pot that Gianna made earlier. I'm really getting into this low-?carb start to the day. I have a boiled egg, bacon, or egg-?white omelette every morning without fail.</p><p>And then sometimes a bagel on the way to work. Just if I'm starving. As I sit down, the kitchen seems calm and tranquil. But I'm still jittery. What if I'd taken things further with Jon? What if Eric had found out? I could have wrecked everything. I've only had this marriage for a few weeksand already I'm risking it. I need to cherish it. Like a yucca plant. \u201cMorning!\u201d Eric breezes into the kitchen in a blue shirt, looking ebullient. I'm not surprised. Last night's launch was the best they've ever had, apparently. \u201cSleep well?\u201d \u201cGreat, thanks!\u201d We're not sharing a bedroom yet, nor have we tried sex again. But if I'm going to cherish my marriage, maybe we should be getting more physical. I stand up to get the pepper and brush deliberately against Eric. \u201cYou look great this morning.\u201d I smile up at him. \u201cSo do you!\u201d I run my hand down his jawline. Eric's eyes meet mine questioningly, and he puts a hand up to meet mine. I glance quickly at the clock. There isn't time, thank God. No. I didn't think that. I need to be positive. Sex with Eric is going to be great, I know it is. Maybe we just need to do it in the dark. And not talk to each other. \u201cHow are you... feeling?\u201d Eric says with a cryptic little smile. \u201cI'm feeling fine! In a bit of a hurry, though.\u201d I flash him a smile, move away, and gulp at my tea before he can suggest a quickie against the oven. Thank goodness, he seems to get the message. He pours himself a cup of tea, then takes out his BlackBerry as it beeps. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh!\u201d he says, sounding pleased. \u201cI've just won a case of '88 Lafite Rothschild at auction.\u201d 270 \u201cWow!\u201d I say enthusiastically. \u201cWell done, darling!\u201d \u201cEleven hundred quid,\u201d he continues. \u201cBit of a steal.\u201d Eleven hundred quid?</p><p>\u201cFor... how many bottles?\u201d I ask. \u201cA case.\u201d He frowns as though it's obvious. \u201cTwelve.\u201d I can't speak. Eleven hundred quid for twelve bottles of wine? I'm sorry, that's just... wrong. Does he know how much eleven hundred quid is? I could buy a hundred bottles of wine for that. And they'd still be posh ones. And I'd have money left over. \u201cLexi, are you okay?\u201d \u201cI'm fine.\u201d I come to. \u201cJust thinking... what a great deal!\u201d With a final gulp of tea I put on my jacket and pick up my briefcase. \u201cBye, darling.\u201d \u201cBye, sweetheart.\u201d Eric comes over and we kiss each other good-?bye. It's aaually starting to feel quite natural. I shrug on my jacket and am at the door when something hits me. \u201cHey, Eric,\u201d I say as casually as possible. \u201cWhat's... Mont Blanc?\u201d \u201cMont Blanc?\u201d Eric turns, his face searching mine in disbelief. \u201cYou're kidding. Do you remember Mont Blanc?\u201d Okay. I really fell into this one. I can't say \u201cNo, Jon told me.\u201d \u201cI don't remember, exactly,\u201d I improvise. \u201cBut the name 'Mont Blanc' came back to me, and it seemed significant, somehow. Does it mean something... special?\u201d \u201cYou'll find out, darling.\u201d I can see the suppressed pleasure in Eric's face. \u201cIt'll all come back to you. I won't say any more for now. This has to be a good sign!\u201d \u201cMaybe!\u201d I try to match his excitement. \u201cWell...see you later!\u201d I head out of the kitchen, racking my brain. Mont Blanc. Skiing? Those posh fountain pens? A great big snowy mountain?</p><p>I have absolutely no idea. I get off the tube at Victoria, buy a bagel, and nibble it as I walk along. But as I get near the office, I'm suddenly not hungry anymore. I have a nasty churning in my stomach. That kind of sinking, I-?don't-?want-?go-?to-?school sensation. Fi might be my friend again, but no one else is. And I messed up in front of Simon Johnson, and I still don't feel on top of anything... As the building comes in sight I stop, heavy with dread. Come on, I tell myself firmly. It'll be fun. No, it won't. Well, okay, it won't. But I don't have any choice. Summoning all my determination, I chuck the rest of the bagel in a bin and push my way through the main glass doors. I head straight up to my office without bumping into anyone, sit down, and pull my pile of papers toward me. As I do so, I notice the Post-?it I wrote yesterday: Discuss sales with Byron. Maybe I'll do that now. I lift the phone to dial his extension, but put it down again when there's a knock at the door. \u201cHello?\u201d \u201cHi, Lexi?\u201d Debs edges her way into the room. She's wearing a turquoise beaded cardigan and denim skirt, and holding an envelope. \u201cOh,\u201d I say apprehensively. \u201cHi, Debs.\u201d \u201cHow are you?\u201d She sounds awkward. \u201cI'm... fine.\u201d The door widens to reveal Fi and Carolyn, both looking ill at ease too. \u201cHi!\u201d I exclaim in surprise. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d \u201cI told them what you told me,\u201d says Fi. \u201cLast night we went out for a drink and I told them.\u201d \u201cWe didn't realize,\u201d says Debs, looking worried. \u201cWe 272 didn't give you a chance. We just assumed you were still...\u201d She casts around for the word. \u201cA power-?crazed nightmare,\u201d supplies Carolyn, deadpan. \u201cWe feel bad.\u201d Debs bites her lip as she looks at the others. \u201cDon't we?\u201d \u201cDon't worry.\u201d I force a smile. But all of a sudden, as I regard the three of them, I feel more lonely than ever. These were my mates; we were always a foursome. But now they've had three years of nights out and talking and laughs that I've missed out on. They're banded together in a trio and I'm the stranger.</p><p>\u201cSo, I just wanted to give you this.\u201d Debs advances toward the desk, her face pinkening, and hands me the envelope. I rip it open and pull out a stiff white engraved card. A wedding invitation. \u201cHope you can come.\u201d Debs has shoved her hands into her pockets. \u201cYou and Eric.\u201d I feel a rush of humiliation. Her body language is obvious. The last thing she wants is us at her wedding. \u201cLook, Debs, you don't have to ask me. It's really kind of you...\u201d I'm trying to stuff the card back into the envelope, my face hot. \u201cBut I know you don't really\u201d \u201cYes, I do.\u201d She puts her hand on mine, stopping me, and I look up. Her eyes are just the same as they ever were deep blue with long mascaraed lashes. \u201cYou were one of my best friends, Lexi. I know things changed. But... you should be there.\u201d \u201cWell... thanks,\u201d I mumble at last. \u201cI'd love to come.\u201d I turn the invitation over, running a finger over the engraving. \u201cHow did you get your mother to agree to such a late guest?\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe nearly killed me,\u201d Debs says bluntly, and I can't help laughing. \u201cDid she threaten to stop your allowance?\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d Debs exclaims, and this time we all break into giggles. Debs's mum has been threatening to stop her allowance ever since I've known hereven though she stopped giving Debs an allowance about ten years ago. \u201cWe've bought some muffins, too,\u201d says Fi. \u201cTo say sorry for yesterday...\u201d She stops as there's a tapping at the door. Simon Johnson is standing in the doorway. \u201cSimon!\u201d I start in shock. \u201cI didn't see you there!\u201d \u201cLexi.\u201d He smiles. \u201cAvailable for a quick chat?\u201d \u201cWe'll go,\u201d Fi says hurriedly, and hustles the others out. \u201cThanks for that... e r . . . information, Lexi. Very useful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Fi!\u201d I smile at her gratefully. \u201cI won't take up your time,\u201d Simon says, shutting the door as they leave. \u201cJust wanted to give you the final rundown for Monday's meeting. Obviously keep it close to your chest. Within this department, only you and Byron have this information.\u201d He comes toward the desk, holding out a folder. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d I nod in a businesslike manner. \u201cThanks.\u201d As I take the folder from him, I see June '07 typed discreetly in the top right-?hand corner and feel a twinge of foreboding. I still have no idea what June '07 means. I searched through all my files yesterday afternoon, but found nothing. No computer files, no paperwork, nothing. I know I should have asked Byron. But I was too proud. I wanted to figure it out for myself. \u201cLooking forward to it!\u201d I pat the folder, hoping I look convincing. \u201cGood. It's Monday, twelve noon sharp, in the 274 boardroom. A couple of the nonexecutive directors have to shoot off promptly.\u201d \u201cSee you there,\u201d I say with a confident smile. \u201cThanks, Simon.\u201d The minute Simon has left, I sit down and whip open the folder. The first page is entitled Summary, and I run my eyes down the text. June '07... major restructuring... realignment in the market... overall rethink... After a few seconds I sink down into my chair, feeling overwhelmed. No wonder this is a big secret. The whole company's being changed around. We're acquiring a home technology company... we're amalgamating several departments . . . I flick my eyes farther down. . . . context of its current sales performance... plans to disband... What? I read the words again. And again. My spine has gone cold. I'm frozen on my chair, reading the lines over and over. That can't... it can't mean what I think it means... With a surge of adrenaline I leap to my feet and hurtle out the door and down the corridor. There's Simon, by the lifts, talking to Byron. \u201cSimon!\u201d I'm gulping air in my panic. \u201cCould I possibly have a quick word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLexi.\u201d As he looks up I can see a wrinkle of irritation in his brow. \u201cHi.\u201d I look around, checking there's no one around to overhear. \u201cI just wanted t o . . . t o . . . clarify a couple of things. These plans to disband the Flooring section.\u201d</p><p>I tap the folder. \u201cThat can't mean...you can't really mean...\u201d \u201cShe's finally twigged.\u201d Byron folds his arms, shaking his head with such amusement that I want to punch him. He knew about this? Simon sighs. \u201cLexi, we've been through this many times, as you know. It's a tough market out there. You've done marvels with your sales forcewe all appreciate that. And you yourself will be rewarded. But the department is unsustainable.\u201d \u201cBut you can't get rid of Flooring! Deller Carpets is all about flooring! This is how the company started!\u201d \u201cKeep your voice down!\u201d Simon snaps sotto voce, glancing around the floor. All the pleasantness has disappeared from his veneer. \u201cLexi, I cannot have this level of disruption. It's highly unprofessional.\u201d \u201cBut\u201d \u201cThere's nothing to worry about. You and Byron will both have new roles in senior management. It's all been worked out very carefully. I don't have time for this.\u201d The lift arrives and he steps into it. \u201cBut, Simon,\u201d I say desperately. \u201cYou can't just fire the whole department \u201d It's too late. The lift doors have closed. \u201cIt's not called firing,\u201d Byron's sardonic voice comes behind me. \u201cIt's called making redundant. Get your terrns right.\u201d \u201cHow can you just stand there?\u201d I wheel around, incensed. \u201cAnd how come I didn't know anything about this?\u201d \u201cOh, didn't I tell you?\u201d Byron clicks his tongue in mock self-?reproach. \u201cI'm sorry, Lexi. It's hard to know where to start when you've forgotten... let's see. Everything.\u201d \u201cWhere are the files? Why didn't I see this before?\u201d \u201cI may have borrowed them.\u201d He shrugs and heads toward his office. \u201cCiao.\u201d \u201cNo! Wait!\u201d I push my way in behind him and close the door. \u201cI don't understand. Why are they axing the department?\u201d \u201cHave you looked at our sales recently?\u201d Byron rolls his eyes. \u201cThey went up!\u201d I retort before I can stop myself, already knowing this is the wrong tack. \u201cBy three percent?\u201d Byron says scoffingly. \u201cLexi, carpet is old news. We've failed to penetrate the other flooring markets. We've only got a couple of contracts to see out. Face it. The party's over.\u201d \u201cBut we can't just lose the department. Those original carpet designs are classics! What about... rugs?\u201d Byron stares at me incredulously for a moment, then bursts into laughter. \u201cYou're hilarious, you know that?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cYou do know you're repeating yourself? You said all this at the first crisis meeting. 'We could make the carpets into rugs!'\u201d he imitates me in a shrill voice. \u201cGive up.\u201d \u201cBut they'll all be out of a job! The whole team!\u201d \u201cYeah. Shame.\u201d He sits at his desk and motions toward the door. \u201cI have work to do?\u201d \u201cYou're a bastard,\u201d I say, my voice shaking, I stride out of his office and slam the door, still clutching the folder, breathing harder and harder until I think I might hyperventilate. I have to read all this information, I have to think \u201cLexi!\u201d My head jerks up and instinctively I clasp the folder closer to my chest. Fi is standing at the door of the main Flooring office, beckoning me. \u201cCome in! Have a muffin.\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a moment I just stare speechlessly at her. \u201cCome on!\u201d She laughs. \u201cSimon Johnson's gone now hasn't he?\u201c \u201dUrn... yes,\u201c I say huskily. \u201dHe has.\u201c \u201dWell, come on, then! We're all waiting!\u201c I can't refuse. I have to appear normal; I haveto appear friendly, even though I'm in a state of meltdown . .. Fi grabs my armand as I follow her into the main office, I feel an almighty shock. A banner has been strung up between two window latches, reading Welcome Back, Lexi!!! A plate of fresh muffins is on the filing cabinet, along with an Aveda gift basket. \u201dWe never gave you a proper welcome back,\u201c says Fi, her face slightly pink. \u201dAnd we just wanted to say we're glad you're okay after the car crash.\u201c She addresses the room. \u201dTo those of you who didn't know Lexi way back when... I just want to say that I think this accident has changed things. I know she's going to be the most fantastic boss and we should all get right behind her. Here's to you, Lexi.\u201c She lifts her coffee mug and the whole room breaks into applause. \u201dThanks, everyone,\u201c I manage, my face puce. \u201dYou're... all great.\u201c They're all about to lose their jobs. They have no idea. And they've bought me muffins and a gift basket. \u201dHave a coffee.\u201c Fi brings a mug over. \u201dLet me take that folder for you...\u201c \u201dNo!\u201c I gasp, clutching it tighter. \u201dIt's... fairly confidential...\u201c \u201dIt's all our bonuses, isn't it?\u201c Debs says with a grin, and 278 then gives me a nudge. \u201dMake sure they're all nice and big, Lexi! I want a new handbag!\u201d Somehow I raise a sick smile. I'm in a bad dream. As I finally leave work at six-?thirty, the nightmare hasn't lifted. I have the weekend to put together a defense of the Flooring department somehow. And I barely know what the problem is, let alone the answer. As I'm jabbing the ground-?floor button in the lift, Byron slips in, wearing his overcoat.</p><p>\u201cWorking at home?\u201d He raises his eyebrows as he sees my stuffed briefcase. \u201cI have to save the department,\u201d I say shortly. \u201cI'm going to work all weekend until I find a solution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to be kidding.\u201d Byron shakes his head incredulously. \u201cLexi, haven't you read the proposal? This is going to be better for you and me. They're creating a new strategic team, we're going to have more power, more scope...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat's not the point!\u201d I cry in a blaze of fury, \u201cWhat about all our friends who won't have anything?\u201d \u201cSob, sob, let me just mop up my bleeding heart,\u201d Byron drawls. \u201cThey'll find jobs.\u201d He hesitates, eyeing me closely. \u201cYou know, you weren't bothered before.\u201d</p> <p>It takes a second or two for his words to register. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cBefore you had that car crash, you were all for getting rid of Flooring. Once you saw your new package. More power for us, more money... what's not to love?\u201d</p><p>A coldness creeps over me. \u201cI don't believe you.\u201d My voice is jerky. \u201cI don't believe you. I would never have sold out my friends.\u201d Byron just looks at me pityingly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you would. You're not a saint, Lexi. Why should you be?\u201d The doors open and he strides out of the lift. I arrive at Langridge's department store, and travel up to the personal shopping department as though in a daze. I have an appointment at seven o'clock with my shopper, Ann. According to the manual, I see her every three months and she picks out some \u201cpieces\u201d and we work on that season's \u201clook.\u201d \u201cLexi! How are you?\u201d A voice greets me as I approach the reception area. Ann is very petite, with close-?cropped dark hair, slim black cigarette pants, and a distinct perfume that turns my stomach instantly. \u201cI was so devastated to hear about your accident!\u201d \u201cI'm fine, thanks. All recovered now.\u201d I attempt a smile. I should have canceled this appointment. I don't know what I'm doing here.</p><p>\u201cGood! Now, I have some fabulous pieces for you to see.\u201d Ann ushers me into a cubicle and presents a rail of clothes to me with a flourish. \u201cYou'll see some new shapes and styles here, but I think you can carry them off...\u201d What is she talking about, new shapes and styles? They're all suits in neutral colors. I have a cupboard full of these already. Ann is showing me jacket after jacket, talking about pockets and lengths, but I can't hear a word. Something is buzzing in my head like a trapped insect; it's getting louder and louder.... \u201cDo you have anything different?\u201d I cut her off abruptly. \u201cDo you have anything... alive?\u201d \u201cAlive?\u201d Ann echoes uncertainly. She hesitates, then reaches for another beige jacket. \u201cThis is full of flair...\u201d 280 I stride out of the cubicle onto the main shop floor, feeling like I need to gasp for air. Blood is rushing in my ears. I feel a bit deranged, to be honest. \u201cThis.\u201d I seize a purple minidress with bright splodges on it. \u201cThis is great. I could go clubbing in this.\u201d Ann looks like she wants to pass out. \u201cLexi,\u201d she says at last. \u201cThat's... not what I would call your style.\u201d \u201cWell, I would.\u201d Defiantly I grab a silver miniskirt. \u201cAnd this.\u201d It's exactly like what I'd pick up at New Look, only a million times more expensive, obviously. \u201cLexi.\u201d Ann places her fingers on the bridge of her nose and breathes in a couple of times. \u201cI am your stylist. I know what suits you. You have a very workable, attractive, professional look that we've spent some time honing\u201d \u201cIt's boring. It's stultifying.\u201d I pluck a beige sleeveless dress out of her arms and hold it up. \u201cI'm not this person, I'm just not.\u201d \u201cLexi, you are.\u201d \u201cI'm not! I need fun. I need color.\u201d \u201cYou've existed perfectly well for several years in beige and black.\u201d Ann's face has tightened. \u201cLexi, you told me specifically at our first meeting that what you required was a working capsule wardrobe in neutral colors\u201c \u201dThat was then, okay?\u201c I'm trying to curb my agitation, but it's as if all the events of the day are bubbling up in a rush of distress. \u201dMaybe things have changed. Maybe I've changed.\u201c \u201dThis.\u201c Ann comes up with another beige suit, with tiny pleats. \u201dThis is you.\u201c \u201dIt's not.\u201c \u201dIt is.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt's not me! It's not! I'm not this person! I won't be her!\u201d Tears are stinging my eyes. I start tugging pins out of my chignon, suddenly desperate to get rid of it. \u201cI'm not the kind of person who wears beige suits! I'm not the kind of person who wears her hair in a bun every day. I'm not the kind of person who pays a thousand quid for wine. I'm not the kind of person who...who sells out her friends...'' I'm gulping with sobs by now. My chignon won't come loose, so strands of hair are sticking out all over my head like a scarecrow. My whole face is wet with tears. I wipe my eyes with the back of my hand, and Ann whips the beige dress away in horror. \u201dDon't get tears on the Armani!\u201c she snaps. \u201dHere.\u201c I shove it back to her. \u201dYou're welcome to it.\" And without saying any more, I leave. I head to the cafe on the ground floor, order a hot chocolate, and drink it while I take the rest of the pins out of my chignon. Then I order another, together with a doughnut. After a while, all the carbs have settled in my stomach like a warm, comforting cushion, and I feel better. There has to be a way, there has to. I'll work all weekend, I'll find the solution, I'll save the department A beep from my pocket interrupts my thoughts. I pull out my phone and see it's a text from Eric. How are you doing? Working late? As I stare at the words I'm suddenly touched. Overwhelmingly touched, in fact. Eric cares about me. He's thinking about me. On my way home now, I type back. I missed you today!! It's not exactly true, but it has the right sound to it. I missed you too! comes back instantly. I knew there was a point to marriage. And this is it. Someone to care about you when everything's crap. Someone to cheer you up. Just texting Eric is making me feel a million times warmer than the hot chocolate did. I'm composing a reply in my head when the phone beeps once more. Fancy a Mont Blanc?? :):) Again with the Mont Blanc. What is this? A cocktail, maybe? Well, it's obviously really special to Eric. And there's only one way I'll find out. Great! I text back. Can't wait! Then I pick up my bag, head out of Langridges, and hail a taxi. It only takes about twenty minutes to arrive home, during which time I reread three files, each more depressing than the last. Carpet sales have never been worse in the whole history of the company, whereas every other department is booming. At last I close the files and stare out the taxi window, my mind working overtime. If I could just put a rescue package together... I know there's still value in the Deller Carpet brand \u201cLove?\u201d The taxi driver breaks me out of my reverie. \u201cWe're here.\u201d \u201cOh, right. Thanks.\u201d I'm fumbling for my purse when my phone beeps yet again. I'm ready! Ready? This gets more and more mysterious. Just got home! See you in a minute! I text back briskly, and hand the money to the taxi driver. As I let myself into the flat, the lights are dim, in a setting that I recognize as Seduction. Music is playing so quietly I can barely hear it; other than that it's totally silent. \u201cHi!\u201d I call out cautiously, hanging up my coat. \u201cHi!\u201d</p><p>Eric's distant voice seems to be coming from the bedroom. My bedroom. Well... I guess, officially, our bedroom. I check my reflection in the mirror and hastily give my disheveled hair a comb. Then I head to the other side of the living area and through to the bedroom. The door is only slightly ajar; I can't see inside the room. I stand there for a moment, wondering what on earth this is all about. Then I push the door open. And at the sight before me I nearly scream out loud.</p><p>This is Mont Blanc? This is Mont Blanc? Eric is lying on the bed. Totally naked. Except for the most massive mound of whipped cream on his genital region. \u201cHi, darling.\u201d He raises his eyebrows with a knowing twinkle, then glances downward. \u201cDive in!\u201d 284 In? Dive? Dive in? I'm paralyzed with horror as I survey the creamy, whippy mountain. Every cell in my body is telling me that I do not want to dive in. But I can't just turn and run away, can I? I can't reject him. This is my husband. This is obviously... what we do. Oh God, oh God... Gingerly I edge forward toward the creamy edifice. Barely knowing what I'm doing, I extend a finger and take a tiny scoop from the top of the mound, then put it in my mouth. \u201cIt's... it's sweetened!\u201d My voice is grainy from nerves. \u201cLow calorie.\u201d Eric beams back at me. No. No. I'm sorry. This just... This isn't happening. Not in my lifetime. I have to come up with an excuse \u201cI feel dizzy!\u201d The words come out of nowhere. I clap a hand to my eyes and back away from the bed. \u201cOh my God. I'm having a flashback.\u201d \u201cA flashback?\u201d Eric sits up, alert. \u201cYes! I had a sudden memory of.. .the wedding,\u201d I improvise. \u201cIt was just a brief image, of you and me, but it was really vivid, it took me by surprise...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down, darling!\u201d Eric is frowning anxiously. \u201cTake it easy. Maybe some more memories will come back.\u201d He seems so hopeful, I feel terrible for lying. But it's better than saying the truth, surely?</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI might just go and lie down quietly in the other room, if you don't mind.\u201d I head swiftly toward the door, my hand still shielding my eyes from the sight of the cream mountain. \u201cI'm sorry, Eric, after you went to so much... trouble...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling, it's fine! I'll come too\u201d Eric makes to get up from the bed. \u201cNo!\u201d I cut him off a bit too shrilly. \u201cYou just...sort yourself out. I'll be fine.\u201d Before he can say anything else, I hurry out and flop down on the big cream sofa. My head is spinning, whether from the Mont Blanc shocker or the whole day... I don't know. All I know is, I feel like curling up under a duvet and pretending the world doesn't exist. I can't cope with this life of mine. Any of it.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>I can't look at Eric without seeing whipped cream. Last night I dreamed he was made of whipped cream. It wasn't a great dream. Thankfully we've barely seen each other this weekend. Eric's been doing corporate entertaining and I've been trying desperately to come up with a plan to save Flooring. I've read through all the contracts of the last three years. I've looked at our supplier information. I've analyzed customer feedback.</p> <p>To be honest, it's a crap situation. We did have a small triumph last year, when I negotiated a good deal with a new software company. I guess that's what impressed Simon Johnson. But it masked our real position.</p><p>Not only are orders too low, no one even seems interested in Flooring anymore. We have a fraction of the advertising and marketing budget that other departments do. We're not running any special promotions. In the weekly directors' meeting, Flooring always appears last on the agenda. It's like the Cinderella of the company. But all that will change, if I have anything to do with it. Over the weekend I've devised a total relaunch. It'll need a bit of money and faith and cost-?trimmingbut I'm positive we can kick-?start sales. Cinderella went to the ball, didn't she? And I'm going to be the fairy godmother. I have to be the fairy godmother. I can't let all my friends lose their jobs. Oh God. My stomach heaves yet again with nerves. I'm sitting in the taxi on the way to work, my hair firmly up, my presentation folder in my lap. The meeting is in an hour. All the other directors are expecting to vote to disband Flooring. I'm going to have to argue my socks off. Or else... No. I can't think about \u201cor else.\u201d I have to succeed, I just have to My phone rings and I nearly jump off the seat, I'm so on edge. \u201cHello?\u201d \u201cLexi?\u201d I hear a small voice. \u201cIt's Amy. Are you free?\u201d \u201cAmy!\u201d I say in astonishment. \u201cHi! Actually, I'm on my way somewhere\u201d \u201cI'm in trouble.\u201d She cuts me off. \u201cYou have to come. Please.\u201d \u201cTrouble?\u201d I say, alarmed. \u201cWhat kind of trouble?\u201d \u201cPlease come.\u201d Her voice is quivering all over the place. \u201cI'minNottingHill.\u201d \u201cNotting Hill? Why aren't you at school?\u201d \u201cHang on.\u201d The sound is muffled and I can just hear Amy saying, \u201cI'm talking to my big sister, okay? She's coming.\u201d Then she's back on the line. \u201cPlease, Lexi. Please come. I've got myself into a bit of a mess.\u201d I've never heard Amy like this. She sounds desperate. 288 \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d My mind's racing, trying to think what trouble she could have got into. Drugs? Loan sharks?</p><p>\u201cI'm on the corner of Ladbroke Grove and Kensington Gardens. How long will you be?\u201d \u201cAmy...\u201d I clutch my head. \u201cI can't come now! I have a meeting, it's really important. Can't you phone Mum?\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d Amy's voice rockets in panic. \u201cLexi, you said. You said I could ring whenever I wanted, that you were my big sister, that you'd be there for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn't mean... I have this presentation...\u201d I trail off, suddenly aware of how feeble this sounds. \u201cLook, any other time...\u201d \u201cFine.\u201d Her voice is suddenly tiny. She sounds about ten years old. \u201cGo to your meeting. Don't worry.\u201d Guilt drenches me, mixed with frustration. Why couldn't she have phoned last night? Why pick the very minute I need to be somewhere else? \u201cAmy, just tell me, what's happened?\u201d \u201cIt doesn't matter. Go to your meeting. Sorry I bothered you.\u201d \u201cStop it! Just let me think a second.\u201d I stare blindly out the window, wired up with stress, with indecision There's forty-?five minutes until the meeting. I don't have time, I just don't. I might, if I went straight now. It's only ten minutes to Notting Hill. But I can't risk being late for the meeting, I just can't And then suddenly, against the crackly background of the phone line, I can hear a man's voice. Now he's shouting. I stare at the phone, feeling a nasty chill. I can't leave my little sister in trouble. What if she's got in with some street gang? What if she's about to be beaten up? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAmy, hold on,\u201d I say abruptly. \u201cI'm coming.\u201d I lean forward and knock on the driver's window. \u201cWe need to make a quick detour to Notting Hill. As fast as you can, please.\u201d As we head up Ladbroke Grove, the taxi roaring with the effort, I'm leaning forward, peering desperately out the window, trying to glimpse Amy... and then suddenly I see a police car. On the corner of Kensington Gardens. My heart freezes. I'm too late. She's been shot. She's been knifed.</p><p>Weak with terror, I thrust the cash at the driver and get out of the cab. There's a throng of people in front of the police car, masking my view, all peering and gesturing at something and talking agitatedly to each other. Bloody rubberneckers. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d My voice isn't working properly as I approach the crowd. \u201cIt's my sister, can I get through \u201d Somehow I manage to push my way in between the anoraks and denim jackets, steeling myself for what I might see... And there's Amy. Not shot or knifed. Sitting on a wall, wearing a policeman's hat, looking totally cheery. \u201cLexi!\u201d Amy turns to the policeman standing next to her. \u201cThere she is. I told you she'd come.\u201d \u201cWhat's been going on?\u201d I demand, shaky with relief. \u201cI thought you were in trouble!\u201d \u201cIs this your sister?\u201d The policeman chimes in. He's stocky and sandy-?haired, with large freckled forearms, and has been making notes on a clipboard. \u201cEr...yes.\u201d My heart is sinking. Has she been shoplifting or something? \u201cWhat's wrong?\u201d \u201cI'm afraid this young lady's in trouble. She's been exploiting tourists. A lot of angry people here.\u201d He gestures at the crowd. \u201cNothing to do with you, is this?\u201d 290 \u201cNo! Of course not! I don't even know what you're talking about!\u201d \u201cCelebrity tours.\u201d He hands me a leaflet, his eyebrows raised sky-?high. \u201cSo-?called.\u201d In disbelief I read the leaflet, which is fluorescent yellow and has obviously been put together on some crappy wordprocessor.

Do not be fooled! This is part of their Undercover Secret!

She has the same long blond straight hair and a similar kind of face. Just a bit older and more haggard. \u201cAre you with her?\u201d The Gwyneth look-?alike suddenly spots me and comes down her steps. \u201cI want to make an official complaint. I've had people taking pictures of my home all week, intruding into my lifeFor the last time, she's not called fucking Apple!\u201d She turns to a young Japanese woman who is calling \u201cApple! Apple!\u201d to the little girl, trying to get a picture. This woman is furious. And I don't blame her. \u201cThe more I tell people I'm not Gwyneth Paltrow, the more they think I am her,\u201d she's saying to the policeman. \u201cI can't win. I'll have to move!\u201d \u201cYou should be flattered!\u201d Amy says insouciantly. \u201cThey think you're an Oscar-?winning movie star!\u201d \u201cYou should be put in jail!\u201d snarls not-?Gwyneth. She looks like she wants to hit Amy over the head. To be honest, I'd be right behind her. \u201cI'm going to have to reprimand your sister officially.\u201d The policeman turns to me as a policewoman tactfully steps in and leads not-?Gwyneth back to her house. \u201cI can release her into your custody, but only when you've filled in these forms and arranged an appointment at the station.\u201d \u201cFine,\u201d I say, and shoot a murderous look at Amy. \u201cWhatever.\u201d \u201cPiss off!\u201d Not-?Gwyneth is rounding on a young geeky guy who is tagging along behind her hopefully, holding out a CD. \u201cNo, I can't get that to Chris Martin! I don't even like bloody Coldplay!\u201d 292 Amy is sucking in her cheeks as though she's trying not to laugh. Yeah. This is so funny. We're all having a great time. I don't have to be somewhere else really important, or anything. I fill in all the forms as quickly as I can, stamping a furious full stop after my signature.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan we go now?\u201d \u201cAll right. Try and keep tabs on her,\u201d the policeman adds, handing me back a duplicate form and leaflet entitled \u201cYour Guide to a Police Reprimand.\u201d Keep tabs on her? Why should I have to keep tabs on her? \u201cSure.\u201d I give a tight smile and stuff the documents into my bag. \u201cI'll do my best. Come on, Amy.\u201d I glance at my watch and feel a spasm of panic. It's already ten to twelve. \u201cQuick. We need to find a taxi.\u201d \u201cBut I want to go to Portobello\u201d \u201cWe need to find a fucking taxi!\u201d I yell. \u201cI need to get to my meeting!\u201d Her eyes widen and she obediently starts scanning the road. At last I flag one down and bundle Amy into it. \u201cVictoria Palace Road, please. Quick as you can.\u201d There's no way I'll make it for the start. But I can still get there. I can still say my piece. I can still do it. \u201cLexi... thanks,\u201d says Amy in a small voice. \u201cIt's fine.\u201d As the taxi heads back down Ladbroke Grove my eyes are glued to the road, desperately willing lights to change, willing traffic to move over. But everything's suddenly solid. I'm never going to get there for midday. Abruptly I pull out my phone, dial Simon Johnson's office number, and wait for his PA, Natasha, to answer.</p><p>\u201cHi, Natasha?\u201d I say, trying to sound calm and professional. \u201cIt's Lexi. I'm having a slight holdup, but it's really vital that I speak at the meeting. Could you tell them to wait for me? I'm on my way in a taxi.\u201c \u201dSure,\u201c Natasha says pleasantly. \u201dI'll tell them. See you later.\u201c \u201dThanks!\u201c I ring off and lean back in my seat, a tiny bit more relaxed. \u201dSorry,\u201c Amy says suddenly. \u201dYeah, whatever.\u201c \u201dNo, really, I am.\u201c I sigh, and look at Amy properly for the first time since we got in the cab. \u201d Why, Amy?\u201c \u201dTo make money.\u201c She shrugs. \u201dWhy not?\u201c \u201dBecause you'll get in serious trouble! If you need money, can't you get a job? Or ask Mum?\u201c \u201dAsk Mum,\u201c she echoes scornfully. \u201dMum doesn't have any money.\u201c \u201dOkay, maybe she doesn't have loads of money\u201c \u201dShe doesn't have any. Why d'you think the house is falling down? Why d'you think the heating's never on? I spent half of last winter at my friend Rachel's house. At least they put on the radiators. We're skint.\u201c \u201dBut that's weird,\u201c I say, puzzled. \u201dHow come? Didn't Dad leave Mum anything?\u201c I know some of Dad's businesses were a bit dodgy. But there were quite a few of them, and I know she was expecting a windfall when he died. Not that she ever would have admitted it. \u201dDunno. Not much, anyway.\u201c \u201dWell, whatever, you can't carry on like this. Seriously, you'll end up in jail or something.\u201c 294 \u201dBring it on.\u201c Amy tosses back her blue-?streaked hair. \u201dPrison's cool.\u201c \u201dPrison's not cool!\u201c I stare at her. \u201dWhere d'you get that idea? It's gross! It's manky! Everyone has bad hair, and you can't shave your legs or use cleanser.\u201c I'm making all this up. Probably these days they have inprison spas and blow dryers. \u201dAnd there aren't any boys,\u201c I add for good measure. \u201dAnd you're not allowed an iPod, or any chocolate or DVDs. You just have to march around a yard.\u201d That bit I'm sure isn't true. But I'm on a roll now. \u201cWith chains around your legs.\u201d \u201cThey don't have leg chains anymore,\u201d Amy says scornfully. \u201cThey brought them back,\u201d I lie without missing a beat. \u201cEspecially for teenagers. It was a new experimental government initiative. Jeez, Amy, don't you read the papers?\u201d</p><p>Amy looks slightly freaked. Ha. That pays her back for Moo-?mah. \u201cWell, it's in my genes.\u201d She regains some of her defiance. \u201cTo be on the wrong side of the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt's not in your genes\u201d \u201cDad was in prison,\u201d she shoots back triumphantly. \u201cDad?\u201d I stare at her. \u201cWhat do you mean, Dad?\u201d The idea's so preposterous, I want to laugh. \u201cHe was. I heard some men talking about it at the funeral. So it's, like, my fate.\u201d She shrugs and takes out a pack of cigarettes. \u201cStop it!\u201d I grab the cigarettes and throw them out the window. \u201cDad didn't go to prison. You're not going to prison. And it's not cool; it's lame.\u201d I break off and think for a moment. \u201cLook, Amy... come and be an intern at my office. It'll be fun. You can get some experience, and earn some money.\u201c \u201dHow much?\u201c she shoots back. God, she's annoying sometimes. \u201dEnough! And maybe I won't tell Mum about this.\u201c I flick the yellow leaflet. \u201dDeal?\u201c There's a long silence in the taxi. Amy is peeling at the chipped blue varnish on her thumbnail, as though it's the most important thing in the world. \u201dOkay,\u201c she says at last, shrugging. The taxi pulls up at a red light and I feel a spasm as I consult my watch for the millionth time. It's twenty past. I just hope they started late. My gaze drifts to the yellow leaflet again and a grin reluctantly creeps over my face. It was a pretty ingenious scheme. \u201dSo, who were your other celebrities?\u201c I can't help asking. \u201dYou didn't really have Madonna.\u201c \u201dI did!\u201c Amy's eyes light up. \u201dThis woman in Kensington looked just like Madonna, only fatter. Everyone totally fell for it, especially when I said that proved how much airbrushing they did. And I had a Sting, and a Judi Dench, and this really nice milkman in Highgate who looked the spitting image of Elton John.\u201c \u201dElton John? A milkman?\u201c I can't help laughing. \u201dI said he was doing community service on the quiet.\u201c \u201dAnd how on earth did you find them?\u201c \u201dJust went looking. Gwyneth was my firstshe gave me the idea.\u201c Amy grins. \u201dShe really hates me.\u201c \u201dI'm not surprised! She probably gets more hassle than the real Gwyneth Paltrow.\u201c The taxi moves off again. We're nearing Victoria Palace Road now. I open my presentation folder and scan my 296 notes, just to make sure all the important points are fresh in my mind. \u201dYou know, they did say Dad had been in prison.\u201c Amy's quiet voice takes me by surprise. \u201dI didn't make it up.\u201c I don't know what to say. I can't get my head around this. Our dad? In prison? It seems... impossible. \u201dDid you ask Mum about it?\u201c I venture at last. \u201dNo.\u201c She shrugs. \u201dWell, I'm sure it wouldn't have been for anything\u201c I flounder, feeling out of my depth\u201dyou know, bad.\u201c \u201dD'you remember how he used to call us the girls?\u201c All trace of bolshiness has vanished from Amy's face. \u201dHis three girls. You, Mum, and me.\u201c I smile reminiscently. \u201dAnd he used to dance with each us.\u201c \u201dYeah.\u201c Amy nods. \u201dAnd he always bought those massive boxes of chocolates\u201c \u201dAnd you used to get sick...\u201c \u201dDeller Carpets, ladies.\u201c The taxi has drawn up in front of the Deller Building. I hadn't even noticed. \u201dOh, right. Thanks.\u201c I root in my bag for some money. \u201dAmy, I have to rush. I'm sorry, but this is really, really important.\u201c \u201dWhat's up?\u201c To my surprise she actually looks interested. \u201dI have to save my department.\u201c I wrench open the handle and scramble out of the cab. \u201dI have to talk eleven directors into doing something they've already decided not to do. And I'm late. And I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.\u201c \u201dWow.\u201c Amy makes a dubious face. \u201dWell... good luck with that.\u201c \u201dThanks. And... we'll talk more.\u201d I give her a brief hug then skitter up the steps and crash into the lobby. I'm only half an hour late. It could be worse. \u201cHi!\u201d I call to Jenny the receptionist as I run past the desk. \u201cI'm here! Can you let them know?\u201d \u201cLexi\u201d Jenny starts to call something out to me, but I haven't got time to stop. I hurry to a waiting lift, jab the button for the eighth floor, and wait the agonizing thirty or so seconds it takes to get to the top. We need express lifts in this place. We need emergency, late-?for-?a-?meeting instant lifts... At last. I burst out, run toward the boardroom... and stop. Simon Johnson is standing in the corridor outside the boardroom, talking cheerfully to three other guys in suits. A man in a blue suit is shrugging on his raincoat. Natasha is milling around, pouring cups of coffee. There's a hubbub of chatter. \u201cWhat's...\u201d My chest is bursting with adrenaline. I can barely speak. \u201cWhat's going on?\u201d All the faces turn toward me in surprise. \u201cDon't panic, Lexi.\u201d Simon shoots me the same disapproving frown he had before. \u201cWe're having a break. We've finished the crucial part of the meeting and Angus has to leave.\u201d He gestures toward the guy in the raincoat. \u201cFinished?\u201d I feel an almighty lurch of horror. \u201cDo you mean\u201d \u201cWe've voted. In favor of the reorganization.\u201d \u201cBut you can't!\u201d I hurry toward him in panic. \u201cI've found a way to save the department! We just have to trim a few costs; and I had some ideas about marketing\u201d Simon cuts me off firmly. \u201cLexi, we've made our decision.\u201d \u201cBut it's the wrong decision!\u201d I cry desperately. \u201cThere's 298 value in the brandI know there is! Please.\u201c I appeal directly to Angus. \u201dDon't leave. Hear me out. Then you can vote again...\u201c \u201dSimon.\u201c Angus turns away from me, looking embarrassed. \u201dGood to see you. I have to run.\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d They aren't even acknowledging me. No one wants to know. I watch, my legs watery, as the directors file back into the boardroom. \u201cLexi.\u201d Simon is in front of me. \u201cI admire your loyalty to your department. But you cannot behave like this at directors' meetings.\u201d There's steel beneath his pleasant voice; I can tell he's furious. \u201cSimon, I'm sorry...\u201d I swallow. \u201cNow, I know things have been tricky for you since your accident.\u201d He pauses. \u201cSo what I suggest is you take three months' paid leave. And when you return, we'll find you a more... suitable role within the company. All right?\u201d All the blood drains from my face. He's demoting me. \u201cI'm fine,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cI don't need any leave\u201d \u201cI think you do.\u201d He sighs. \u201cLexi, I'm truly sorry about how things have gone. If you recovered your memory, then things would be different, but Byron's been filling me in on your situation. You're not up to a senior position right now.\u201d There's an absolute finality in his voice. \u201cFine,\u201d I manage at last. \u201cI understand.\u201d \u201cNow, you might want to go down to your department. Since you weren't here\u201dhe pauses meaningfully\u201cI gave Byron the task of breaking the unfortunate news to them.\u201d Byron? With a final curt nod, Simon disappears into the boardroom. I watch the door as though pinioned to the floor then with a sudden burst of panic, run to the lift. I can't let Byron tell them the bad news. I have to do that myself, at least. In the lift, I punch Byron's direct line into my cell phone and get his voice mail. \u201cByron!\u201d I say, my voice quivering with urgency. \u201cDon't tell the department about the redundancies yet, okay? I want to do it myself. Repeat, do not tell them.\u201c Without looking right or left I pelt out of the lift, into my office, and close the door. I'm shaking all over. I've never been so petrified in my life. How am I going to break the news? What am I going to say? How do you tell all your friends they're losing their jobs? I pace around my office, twisting my hands, feeling like I might throw up. This is worse than any exam, any test, anything I've ever done And then a sound alerts me. A voice outside the door. \u201dIs she in there?\u201c \u201dWhere's Lexi?\u201c chimes in another voice. \u201dIs she hiding? Bitch.\u201c For an instant I consider diving under the sofa and never coming out. \u201dIs she still upstairs?\u201c The voices are getting louder outside my door. \u201dNo, I saw her! She's in there! Lexi! Come out here!\u201c Someone bangs on the door, making me flinch. Somehow I force myself to move forward across the carpet. Gingerly I stretch out a hand and open the door. They know. They're all standing there. All fifteen members of the Flooring department, silent and reproachful. Fi is at the front, her eyes like stone. \u201dIt... it wasn't me,\u201c I stammer desperately. \u201dPlease listen, 300 everyone. Please understand. It wasn't my decision. I tried t o . . . I was going t o . . . \u201c I trail off. I'm the boss. The bottom line is, it was down to me to save the department. And I failed. \u201dI'm sorry,\u201c I whisper, tears filling my eyes, looking from face to unrelenting face. \u201dI'm so, so sorry...\u201d There's silence. I think I might melt under the hatred of their gazes. Then, as though at a signal, they all turn and silently walk away. My legs like jelly, I back toward my desk and sink into my chair. How did Byron break it to everybody? What did he say? And then suddenly I spot it in my inbox. A round-?robin e-?mail under the heading: COLLEAGUESSOME BAD NEWS.</p><p>With trepidation I click on the e-?mail, and as I read the words, I give a whimper of despair. This went out? Under my name? To all colleagues in Flooring As you may have noticed, the performance of Flooring has been appalling of late. It has been decided by senior management to disband the department. You will all therefore be made redundant in June. In the meantime, Lexi and I would be grateful if you would work with improved efficiency and standards. Remember, we'll be giving your references, so no slacking or taking the piss. Yours, Byron and Lexi OK. Now I want to shoot myself.</p><p>When I arrive home Eric is sitting on the terrace in the evening sun. He's reading the Evening Standard and sipping a gin and tonic. He looks up from the paper. \u201cGood day?\u201d \u201cTo be honest... no,\u201d I say, my voice quivering. \u201cIt was a pretty terrible day. The entire department is being fired.\u201d As I say the words out loud I can't help itI dissolve into tears. \u201cAll my friends. They're all losing their jobs. And they all hate me... and I don't blame them \u201d \u201cDarling.\u201d Eric puts down his paper. \u201cIt's business. These things happen.\u201d \u201cI know. But these are my friends. I've known Fi since I was six.\u201d Eric seems to be thinking as he sips his drink. At last he shrugs and turns back to the paper. \u201cLike I say, these things happen.\u201d \u201cThey don't just happen.\u201d I shake my head vehemently. \u201cYou stop them from happening. You fight.\u201d \u201cSweetheart.\u201d Eric appears amused. \u201cYou still have your job, don't you?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThe company's not collapsing, is it?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, then. Have a gin and tonic.\u201d How can he respond like that? Isn't he human? \u201cI don't want a gin and tonic, okay?\u201d I feel like I'm spiraling out of control. \u201cI don't want a bloody gin and tonic!\u201d \u201cA glass of wine, then?\u201d \u201cEric, don't you understand?\u201d I almost shout. \u201cDon't you get how terrible this is?\u201d All my rage toward Simon Johnson and the directors is 302 swiveling direction like a twister, channeling toward Eric, with his calm roof terrace and his Waterford glass and his complacent life. \u201cLexi\u201d \u201cThese people need their jobs! They're not all... ultrahigh rich bloody billionaires!\u201d I gesture around at our glossy balcony. \u201cThey have mortgages. Rent to find. Weddings to pay for.\u201d \u201cYou're overreacting,\u201d Eric says shortly, and turns a page of his paper. \u201cWell, you're underreacting! And I don't understand. I just don't understand you.\u201d I'm appealing to him directly. Wanting him to look up, to explain his view, to talk about it. But he doesn't. It's like he didn't even hear me. My whole body is pulsating with frustration. I feel like throwing his gin and tonic off the balcony. \u201cFine,\u201d I say at last. \u201cLet's not talk about it. Let's just pretend everything's okay and we agree, even though we don't.\u201d I wheel around and draw a sharp breath. Jon is standing at the doors to the terrace. He's wearing black jeans and a white T-?shirt and shades, so I can't see his expression. \u201cHi.\u201d He steps down onto the terrace. \u201cGianna let me in. I'm not... intruding?\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d I turn away swiftly so he can't see my face. \u201cOf course not. It's fine. Everything's fine.\u201d Of all the people to show up. Just to make my day complete. Well, I'm not even going to look at him. I'm not going to acknowledge him. \u201cLexi's a little upset,\u201d Eric says to Jon in a man-?to-?man undertone. \u201cA few people at her work are losing their jobs.\u201d \u201cNot just a few people!\u201d I can't help expostulating. \u201cA whole department! And I didn't do anything to save them. I'm supposed to be their boss and I fucked up.\u201c A tear creeps down my cheek and I roughly wipe it away. \u201dJon.\u201c Eric isn't even listening to me. \u201dLet me get you a drink. I've got the Bayswater plans right here. There's a lot to talk about \u201c He gets up and steps into the sitting room. \u201dGianna! Gianna, are you there?\u201c \u201dLexi.\u201c Jon comes across the terrace to where I'm standing, his voice low and urgent. He's trying it on again. I don't believe this. \u201dLeave me aloneX\u201c I round on him. \u201dDidn't you get the message before? I'm not interested! You're just a . . . a womanizing bullshitter. And even if I were interested, it's not a good time, okay? My whole department has just crumbled to nothing. So unless you have the answer to that, piss off.\u201c There's silence. I'm expecting Jon to come back with some cheesy chat-?up line, but instead he takes off his shades and rubs his head as though perplexed. \u201dI don't understand. What happened to the plan?\u201c \u201dPlan?\u201c I say aggressively. \u201dWhat plan?\u201c \u201dYour big carpet deal.\u201c \u201dWhat carpet deal?\u201c Jon's eyes snap open in shock. For a few moments he just stares at me as though I have to be joking. \u201dYou're not serious. You don't know about it?\u201c \u201dKnow about what?\u201c I exclaim, at the end of my tether. \u201dI have no idea what the fuck you're talking about!\u201c \u201dJesus Christ.\u201c Jon exhales. \u201dOkay, Lexi. Listen to me. You had this massive carpet deal all lined up in secret. You said it was going to change everything, it was going to bring in big bucks, it was going to transform the department So! You enjoy the view, huh.\u201d He seamlessly switches track as Eric appears at the door, holding a gin and tonic. 304 Massive carpet deal? My heart is beating fast as I stand there, watching Eric give Jon his drink and pull out a chair under the huge sunshade. Ignore him, says a voice in my head. He's making it up. He's playing youthis is all part of the game. But what if it's not?</p><p>\u201cEric, darling, I'm sorry about earlier.\u201d My words come out almost too fluently. \u201cIt's just been a difficult day. Could you possibly get me a glass of wine?\u201d I'm not even looking at Jon. \u201cNo problem, sweetheart.\u201d Eric disappears inside again and I wheel around. \u201cTell me what you're talking about,\u201d I say in low tones. \u201cQuickly. And this better not be a windup.\u201d As I meet his gaze I feel the sting of humiliation. I have no idea if I can trust anything he says or not. But I have to hear more. Because if there's just a one percent chance that what he's saying is true... \u201cThis isn't a windup. If I'd realized before that you didn't know...\u201d Jon shakes his head incredulously. \u201cYou'd been working on this thing for weeks. You had a big blue file that you used to carry around. You were so excited about it you couldn't sleep\u201d \u201cBut what was it?\u201d \u201cI don't know the exact details. You were too superstitious to tell me. You had this theory I was a jinx.\u201d His mouth twists briefly as though he's sharing a private joke. \u201cBut I know it was using retro carpet designs from some old pattern book. And I know it was going to be huge.\u201d \u201cBut why don't I know about it? Why doesn't anyone know about it?\u201d \u201cYou were keeping it quiet until the last moment. You said you didn't trust everyone at the office and it was safer not to.\u201c He lifts his voice. \u201dHey, Eric. How's it going?\u201c I feel like I've been slapped in the face. He can't stop there. \u201dHere you are, Lexi,\u201c Eric says cheerfully, handing me a glass of wine. Then he heads to the table, sits down, and gestures at Jon to sit. \u201dSo the latest is, I spoke to the planning officer again...\u201d I'm standing perfectly still as they talk, my mind racing torn apart with uncertainty. It could all be bullshit. Maybe I'm a gullible fool, listening to even a word. But how would he know about the old pattern book? What if it's true? My chest constricts with a deep, painful spasm of hope.

The sun is hot on my face. I'm barely aware of the distant roar of traffic below. Over at the table, Jon and Eric are studying an architect's drawing. \u201cWe might have to rethink the parking completely.\u201d Jon is sketching on the paper. \u201cIt's not the end of the world.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d Eric sighs heavily. \u201cIf you think it can be done, Jon, I trust you.\u201d I take a deep swig of winethen pull out my phone. I cannot believe I'm about to do this. With fumbling hands I find Jon's number and type a text. Can we meet? L 306 I press Send, then immediately slip my phone into my bag and stare rigidly out at the view. A moment later, still sketching and without looking anywhere near me, Jon takes his phone out of his pocket with his other hand. He checks it briefly and types back a return text. Eric doesn't even seem to notice. I force myself to count to fiftythen casually flip open my phone. Sure. J</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>We've agreed to meet in a cafe called Fabian's in Holland Park, a small, cozy place with terra-?cotta painted walls and prints of Tuscany and shelves full of Italian books. As I walk in and look around at the granite bar, the coffee machine, the battered sofa... I have the weirdest feelinglike I've been there before.</p><p>Maybe I'm just having deja vu. Maybe it's wishful thinking. Jon is already sitting at a table in the corner, and as he looks up I feel my guard rising. Against all my better instincts, after all my protests, here I am, meeting him illicitly. Just like he wanted all along. I feel like I'm falling into some kind of trap... but I don't know what the trap is.</p> <p>Anyway, I'm meeting him for business reasons. As long as I remember that, I'll be fine. \u201cHi.\u201d I join him at the table, where he's drinking coffee, and drop my briefcase on an adjoining chair. \u201cSo. We're both busy people. Let's talk about this deal.\u201d Jon is just staring at me, as though trying to work something out. \u201cIs there anything more you can tell me?\u201d I add, trying to ignore his expression. \u201cI think I'll have a cappuccino.\u201d \u201cLexi, what is this? And what the fuck happened at the party?\u201d \u201c I . . . I don't know what you mean.\u201d I pick up the menu and pretend to be studying it. \u201cMaybe I'll have a latte.\u201d \u201cCome on.\u201d Jon pulls the menu down so he can see my face. \u201cYou can't hide. What happened?\u201d He thinks this is funny. I can tell it from his voice. With a jag of wounded pride, I slap the menu down on the table. \u201cIf you must know,\u201d I say tightly, \u201cI spoke to Rosalie at the party, and she told me about your... predilections. I know it was all bullshit. And I don't appreciate being bullshitted, thanks.\u201d \u201cLexi\u201d \u201cDon't try and pretend, okay? I know you tried it on with her and Margo.\u201d An edge of bitterness has crept into my voice. \u201cYou're just some smooth operator who tells married women what they want to hear. What you think they want to hear.\u201d Jon's expression doesn't flicker. \u201cI did try it on with Rosalie and Margo. And I might have gone\u201che hesitates\u201da tad too far. But you and I agreed I should. That was our cover.\u201d Well, of course he'd bloody well say that. I glare at him in impotent fury. He can say anything he likes, and there's no way for me to know whether he's speaking the truth or not.</p><p>\u201cYou have to understand.\u201d He leans across the table. \u201cIt was all fake. We cooked up a story that would fool every 309 one, so if we were ever spotted together, that could be the explanation. Rosalie fell for it, just like we wanted her to.\u201d \u201cYou wanted to be portrayed as a womanizer?\u201d I retort, rolling my eyes.</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d There's a sudden heat to his voice. \u201cBut we had a couple of... near misses. Rosalie, in particular she's sharp. She would have cottoned on.\u201d \u201cSo you chat her up.\u201d I can't help the sarcasm. \u201cNice. Really classy.\u201d</p><p>Jon meets my look steadfastly. \u201cYou're right. This hasn't all been pretty. It's not a perfect situation and we've made mistakes.\u201d He reaches a hand toward mine. \u201cBut you have to trust me, Lexi. Please. You have to let me explain everything.\u201d \u201cStop it!\u201d I whip my hands away. \u201cJust... stop! We're not here to talk about that, anyway, it's irrelevant. Let's stick to the subject.\u201c A waitress approaches the table and I look up. \u201dA cappuccino, please.\u201c As soon as the waitress moves away, I say briskly, \u201dSo, this deal. It doesn't exist. I've looked everywhere. I went into the office and searched every tiny corner, every computer file. I've looked at home, nothing. The only thing I've found is this.\u201c I reach into the briefcase and produce the piece of paper with the coded scribbles on it. \u201dThere was an empty drawer in my desk. This was in there.\u201c I'm half-?hoping Jon's eyes will light up and he'll say, \u201dAha! The key!\u201c like we're in The Da Vinci Code. Instead he glances at it and shrugs. \u201dThat's your handwriting.\u201c \u201dI know it's my handwriting.\u201c I try to keep my patience. \u201dBut I don't know what it means!\u201c In frustration I throw the paper down. \u201dWhy on earth didn't I keep my notes on the computer?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u201cThere's a guy at work, Byron?\u201d 310 \u201cYes,\u201d I say guardedly. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d \u201cYou didn't trust him. You thought he actually wanted the department to be disbanded. You thought he'd try and screw things up for you. So you were going to present the whole thing to the board when it was already done.\u201d The door to the cafe swings open and I jump in guilt, imagining it's Eric. I'm all ready with an excuse at the tip of my tongue, I was just out shopping and guess what, I bumped into Jon! By total coincidence! But of course it's not Eric, it's a cluster of teenagers who start talking in French. \u201cSo you don't know anything else.\u201d My guilt makes me sound aggressive, almost accusing. \u201cYou can't help me.\u201d \u201cI didn't say that,\u201d Jon replies calmly. \u201cI've been thinking back, and I did remember something. Your contact was Jeremy Northam. Northwick. Something like that.\u201d \u201cJeremy Northpool?\u201d The name pops into my head. I can remember Clare thrusting a Post-?it at me with his name on it. Along with the other thirty-?five Post-?its. \u201cYes.\u201d Jon nods. \u201cThat could be it. Northpool.\u201d \u201cI think he called while I was in hospital. Several times.\u201d \u201cWell.\u201d Jon raises his eyebrows. \u201cMaybe you should call him back.\u201d \u201cBut I can't.\u201d I drop my hands on the table in despair. \u201cI can't say 'Hi, this is Lexi Smart, do we have a deal, oh and by the way, what's your business?' I don't know enough! Where's all the information?\u201d \u201cIt's there.\u201d Jon is stirring his coffee. \u201cIt's there somewhere. You must have moved the file. Hidden it somewhere, or put it somewhere for safekeeping...\u201d \u201cBut where?\u201d The waitress arrives and puts a cappuccino down in front of me. I pick up the little freebie biscuit and distractedly start unwrapping it. Where would I have put a file? Where would I hide it? What was I thinking? \u201cI remember something else.\u201d Jon drains his cup and gestures to the waitress for another. \"You went down to Kent.</p><p>You went to your mother's house.\u201c \u201dReally?\u201c I look up. \u201dWhen?\u201c \u201dJust before the accident. Maybe you took the file down.\u201c \u201dTo my mum's house?\u201c I say skeptically. \u201dIt's worth a chance.\u201c He shrugs. \u201dCall her up and ask her.\u201c I stir my cappuccino moodily as the waitress brings over another coffee for Jon. I don't want to ring up Mum. Ringing Mum is bad for my health. \u201dCome on, Lexi, you can do it.\u201c Jon's mouth twitches with amusement at my expression. \u201dWhat are you, woman or walrus?\u201c I raise my head, stunned. For a moment I wonder whether I heard that right. \u201dThat's what Fi says,\u201c I say at last. \u201dI know. You told me about Fi.\u201c \u201dWhat did I tell you about Fi?\u201c I say suspiciously. Jon takes a sip of coffee. \u201dYou told me you met in Mrs. Brady's class. You had your first and last cigarette with her. You went to Ibiza together three times. Losing her friendship has been really traumatic.\u201c He nods at my phone, sticking out of my bag. \u201dWhich is why you should make the call.\u201c This is so spooky. What the hell else does he know? Sliding him wary glances, I take the phone out of my bag and key in Mum's number. 312 \u201dLexi, I'm not magic.\u201c Jon looks even more as if he wants to laugh. \u201dWe had a relationship. We talked.\u201c \u201dHello?\u201c Mum's voice on the line tears me away from Jon. \u201dOh, Mum! It's me, Lexi. Listen, did I bring some papers down any time recently? Or like... a folder?\u201c \u201dThat big blue folder?\u201c I feel an almighty thrust of disbelief. It's true. It exists. I can feel the excitement rising inside me. And the hope. \u201dThat's right.\u201c I try to stay calm. \u201dDo you have it? Is it still there?\u201c \u201dIt's in your room, exactly where you left it.\" Mum sounds defensive. \u201cOne corner may be slightly damp...\u201d I don't believe it. A dog's peed on it. \u201cBut it's still okay?\u201d I say anxiously. \u201cIt's still legible?\u201d \u201cOf course!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d I clutch the phone tighter. \u201cWell, just hold on to it, Mum. Keep it safe and I'll come and get it today.\u201d I flip my phone shut and turn to Jon. \u201cYou were right! It's there. Okay, I have to go down there straightaway. I have to get to Victoriathere's bound to be a train in the next hour...\u201d \u201cLexi, calm down.\u201d Jon drains his coffee. \u201cI'll drive you if you like.\u201c \u201dWhat?\u201c \u201dI'm not busy today. It'll have to be in your car, though. I don't have one.\u201c \u201dYou don't have a car?\u201c I say disbelievingly. \u201dI'm between cars at the moment.\u201c He shrugs. \u201dI use my bike or taxis. But I do know how to drive a swanky Mercedes open-?top.\u201d Again he looks like he's sharing a private joke with someone. With me, it suddenly hits me. With the girl I used to be. </p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I open my mouth to speakbut I'm too confused. My head is teeming with thoughts. \u201cOkay,\u201d I say at last. \u201cOkay. Thanks.\u201d We have our story totally worked out. At least I do. If anyone asks, Jon is giving me a driving lesson. He just happened to drop by when I was getting into the car, and just happened to offer. But no one does ask. It's a sunny day, and as Jon reverses the car out of its parking space, he retracts the roof. Then he reaches in his pocket and hands me a black hair elastic. \u201cYou'll need this. It's windy.\u201d I take the hair elastic in surprise. \u201cHow come you have this in your pocket?\u201d \u201cI have them everywhere. They're all yours.\u201d He rolls his eyes, signaling left. \u201cI don't know what you do, shed them?\u201d Silently, I put my hair up into a ponytail before it can get windswept. Jon turns onto the road and heads to the first junction. \u201cIt's in Kent,\u201d I say as we pull up at the lights. \u201cYou have to head out of London on the\u201d \u201cI know where it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know where my mother's house is?\u201d I say a touch incredulously. \u201cI've been there.\u201d The lights turn green and we move on. I stare out at the grand white houses passing by, barely noticing them. He's been to Mum's house. He knows about Fi. He has my hair elastic in his pocket. He was right about the blue folder. Either he's really, really done his research, o r . .. \u201cSo... hypothetically,\u201d I say at last. \u201cIf we were once lovers...\u201d \u201cHypothetically.\u201d Jon nods without turning his head. \u201cWhat exactly happened? How did we...\u201d \u201cLike I told you, we met at a launch party. We kept bumping into each other through the company. I came over to your place more and more. I'd arrive early, while Eric was still tied up. We'd chat, hang out on the terrace It was innocuous.\u201d He pauses, negotiating a tricky lanechange. \u201cThen Eric went away one weekend. And I came over. And after that... it wasn't so innocuous.\u201d I'm starting to believe. It's like the world is slidinga screen is going back. Colors are becoming sharper and clearer. \u201cSo what else happened?\u201d I say. \u201cWe saw each other as often as we could.\u201d \u201cI know that.\u201d I cast around. \u201cI mean...what was it like? What did we say, what did we do? Just...tell me stuff.\u201d \u201cYou crack me up.\u201d Jon shakes his head, his eyes crinkled in amusement. \u201cThat's what you always said to me in bed. 'Tell me stuff.'\u201d \u201cI like hearing stuff.\u201d I shrug defensively. \u201cAny old stuff.\u201d \u201cI know you do. Okay. Any old stuff.\u201d He drives silently for a while and I can see a smile pushing at his mouth as he thinks. \u201cEverywhere we've been together, we've ended up buying you socks. Same thing every time, you rip off your shoes to be barefoot on the sand or the grass or whatever, and then you get cold and we need to find you socks.\u201c He pulls up at a crosswalk. \u201dWhat else? You've got me into putting mustard on fries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrench mustard?\u201d 315 \u201cExactly. When I first saw you, I thought it was an evil perversion. Now I'm addicted.\u201d He pulls away from the crossing and turns onto a big dual carriageway. The car is speeding up; he's harder to hear over traffic noise. \u201cOne weekend it rained. Eric was away playing golf and we watched every single episode of Doctor Who, back to back.\u201d He glances at me. \u201cShould I keep going?\u201d Everything he's saying is resonating. My brain is tuning up. I don't remember what he's talking about, but I'm feeling stirrings of recognition. It feels like me. This feels like my life. \u201cKeep going.\u201d I nod. \u201cOkay. So...we play table tennis. It's pretty brutal. You're two games ahead, but I think you're about to crack.\u201d \u201cI am so not about to crack,\u201d I retort automatically. \u201cOh, you are.\u201d \u201cNever!\u201d I can't help grinning. \u201cYou met my mum. She instantly guessed. She knows me too well to kid her. But that's okay. She's cool, she'd never say anything.\u201d Jon pulls into another lane. \u201cYou always sleep on the left. We've had five whole nights together in eight months.\u201d He's silent for a moment. \u201cEric's had two hundred and thirty-?five.\u201d I don't know how to reply to that. Jon's gaze is focused ahead; his face is intent. \u201cShould I keep going?\u201d he says at last. \u201cYeah.\u201d I clear my throat huskily. \u201cKeep going.\u201d As we drive through the Kent countryside, Jon has exhausted all the details he can give me about our relationship. Obviously I can't supply any of my own, so we're sitting in silence as the hop fields and oast houses pass by. 316 Not that I'm looking at them. I grew up in Kent, so I don't even notice the picturesque, garden-?of-?England scenery. Instead I'm watching the GPS screen in a trance; following the arrow with my gaze.</p><p>Suddenly it reminds me of my conversation with Loser Dave, and I heave a sigh. \u201cWhat's up?\u201d Jon glances over. \u201cOh, nothing. I just still keep wondering, how did I get to where I am? What made me go after my career, get my teeth done, turn into this... other person?\u201d I gesture at myself. \u201cWell,\u201d says Jon, squinting up at a sign. \u201cI suppose it started with what happened at the funeral.\u201c \u201dWhat do you mean?\u201c \u201dYou know. The thing with your dad.\u201c \u201dWhat about my dad?\u201c I say, puzzled. \u201dI don't know what ypu're talking about.\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a screech of brakes, Jon stops the Mercedes right next to a field full of cows, and turns to face me. \u201cDidn't your mother tell you about the funeral?\u201d \u201cOf course she did!\u201d I say. \u201cIt happened. Dad was... cremated or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat's it?\u201d I rack my brain. I'm sure Mum didn't say anything else about the funeral. She changed the subject when I brought it up, I suddenly recall. But, I mean, that's normal for Mum. She changes every subject. Shaking his head in disbelief, Jon puts the car back into gear. \u201cThis is unreal. Do you know anything about your life?\u201d \u201cApparently not,\u201d I say, a bit rattled. \u201cWell, tell me! If it's so important.\u201d \u201cUh-?uh.\u201d Jon shakes his head as the car moves off again.</p><p>\u201cNot my call. Your mum has to tell you this one.\u201d He turns off the road and pulls into a gravel drive. \u201cWe're here.\u201d So we are. I hadn't even noticed. The house is looking pretty much as I remember it: a redbrick house dating from the 1900s, with a conservatory on one side and Mum's ancient Volvo parked in front. The truth is, the place hasn't changed since we moved in twenty years ago; it's just got more crumbly. A length of gutter is hanging off the roof and ivy has crept even farther up the walls. Under a moldy tarpaulin at the side of the drive is a pile of paving stones that Dad once dumped there. He was going to sell them and start a business, I think. That was... eight years ago? Ten? Through the gate I can just glimpse the garden, which used to be quite pretty, with raised flower beds and a herb patch. Before we got the dogs.</p><p>\u201cSo... you're saying Mum lied to me?\u201d Jon shakes his head. \u201cNot lied. Edited.\u201d He opens the car door. \u201cCome on.\u201d The thing about whippets is they look quite slight, but when they stand on their hind legs they're huge. And when about ten of them are trying to jump up on you at once, it's like being mugged. \u201cOphelia! Raphael!\u201d I can just about hear Mum's voice over the scrabbling and yelping. \u201cGet down! Lexi, darling! You really did rush down here. What is all this?\u201d She's wearing a corduroy skirt and blue-?striped shirt with fraying hems at the sleeves, and she's holding an ancient \u201cCharles and Diana\u201d tea towel. \u201cHi, Mum,\u201d I say breathlessly, manhandling a dog off me. \u201cThis is Jon. My...friend.\u201d I gesture at Jon, who is 318 gazing a whippet straight in the eyes and saying, \u201cPut your paws on the floor. Step away from the humans.\u201d \u201cWell!\u201d Mum seems flustered. \u201cIf I'd realized, I would have rustled up some lunch. How you expect me to cater at this late notice\u201d \u201cMum, we don't expect you to cater. All I want is that folder. Is it still there?\u201d \u201cOf course.\u201d She sounds defensive. \u201cIt's perfectly all right.\u201d I hurry up the creaky green-?carpeted stairs and into my bedroom, which still has the floral Laura Ashley wallpaper it always did. Amy's rightthis place stinks. I can't tell if it's the dogs or the damp or the r o t . . . but it should get sorted. I spot the folder on top of a chest of drawers and grab itthen recoil. Now I know why Mum was defensive. This is so gross. It totally smells of dog pee. Wrinkling my nose, I gingerly extend two fingers and open it. There's my writing. Lines and lines of it, clear as day. Like a message from me t o . . . me. I scan the first page, trying to glean as quickly as possible what I was doing, what I was planning, what this is all about I can see I had written some sort of proposal, but what exactly? I turn the page, my brow wrinkled in bewilderment, then turn another page. And that's when I see the name. Oh. My God. In an instant, I understand. I've got the whole picture. I raise my head, my heart thudding with excitement. That is such a good idea. I mean, that is such a good idea. I can already see the potential. It could be huge, it could change everything Filled with adrenaline, I grab the folder, not caring how it smells, and rush out of the room, taking the stairs two steps at a time. \u201cGot it?\u201d Jon is waiting at the bottom of the stairs. \u201cYes!\u201d A smile licks across my face. \u201cIt's brilliant! It's a brilliant idea!\u201d \u201cIt was your idea.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d I feel a glow of pride, which I try to quell. \u201cYou know, this is what we needed all along. This is what we should have been doing. If this works out, they can't give up carpeting. They'd be mad.\u201d A dog jumps up and tries to chew my hair, but even that can't dent my mood. I can't believe I put together this deal. Me, Lexi! I can't wait to tell everyone \u201cNow!\u201d Mum is approaching bearing a tray of coffee cups. \u201cI can at least offer you a cup of coffee and a biscuit.\u201d \u201cReally, Mum, it's okay,\u201d I say. \u201cI'm afraid we have to dash off\u201d \u201cI'd like a coffee,\u201d says Jon pleasantly. He what? Shooting him daggers, I follow him into the sitting room and we sit down on a faded sofa. Jon takes his seat like he feels totally at home there. Maybe he does. \u201cSo, Lexi was just talking about piecing her life together,\u201d he says, crunching a biscuit. \u201cAnd I thought maybe knowing the events that happened at her dad's funeral would help.\u201c \u201dWell, of course, losing a parent is always traumatic...\u201c Mum is focused on breaking a biscuit in two. \u201dHere you are, Ophelia.\u201c She feeds half to a whippet. \u201dThat's not what I'm talking about,\u201c Jon says. \u201dI'm talking about the other events.\u201c 320 \u201dOther events?\u201c Mum looks vague. \u201dNow, Raphael, that's naughty! Coffee, Lexi?\u201c The dogs are all over the biscuit plate, slobbering and grabbing. Are we supposed to eat those now? \u201dLexi doesn't seem to have the fullest of pictures,\u201c Jon persists. \u201dSmoky, it's not your turn...\u201c \u201dStop talking to the fucking dogs!\u201c Jon's voice makes me leap off my seat. Mum looks almost too shocked to speak. Or even move. \u201dThis is your child.\u201c Jon gestures at me. \u201dNot that.\u201c He jerks a thumb at a dog and gets up from the sofa in an abrupt movement. Both Mum and I gaze up at him, transfixed, as he walks over to the fireplace, ruffling his hair, ignoring the dogs clustering around him. \u201dNow, I care about your daughter. She may not realize it, but I do.\u201c He focuses directly on Mum. \u201dMaybe you want to get through life in a state of denial. Maybe it helps you. But it doesn't help Lexi.\u201c \u201dWhat are you talking about?\u201c I say helplessly. \u201dMum, what happened at the funeral?\u201c Mum's hands are fluttering around her face as though to protect herself. \u201dIt was rather... unpleasant.\u201c \u201dLife can be unpleasant,\u201c Jon says bluntly. \u201dIt's even more unpleasant if you don't know about it. And if you don't tell Lexi, I will. Because she told me, you see.\u201c He crunches the last of his biscuit. \u201dAll right! What happened was...\u201d Mum's voice descends into a whisper.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bailiffs came!\u201d Her cheeks are growing pink with distress. \u201cRight in the middle of the party.\u201d \u201cBailiffs? But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey came with no warning. Five of them.\u201d She's staring straight ahead, stroking the dog on her lap with an obsessive repetitive motion. \u201cThey wanted to repossess the house. Take all the furniture, everything. It turned out your father hadn't been... totally honest with me. Or anybody.\u201d \u201cShow her the second DVD,\u201d says Jon. \u201cDon't tell me you don't know where it is.\u201d There's a pause, then without looking at either of us, Mum gets up, roots in a drawer, and finds a blank, shiny disc. She puts it into the machine and the three of us sit back. \u201cDarlings.\u201d Dad is on the screen again, in the same room as in the other DVD, in the same plushy dressing gown. The same charming twinkle as he faces the camera. \u201cIf you're watching this, I've popped it. And there's something you should know. But this one's not for... public consumption, shall we say.\u201d He takes a deep puff on his cigar, frowning regretfully. \u201cThere's been a bit of a catastrophe on the old moolah front. Didn't mean to land you in it. You girls are cleveryou'll find a way to sort it out.\u201d He considers for a moment. \u201cBut if you're stuck, ask old Dickie Hawford. He should be good for a bit. Cheers, m'dears.\u201d He lifts his glass upthen the screen goes dark. I wheel around to Mum. \u201cWhat did he mean, 'catastrophe'?\u201d \u201cHe meant he'd remortgaged the entire house.\u201d Her voice is trembling. \u201cThat was his real message. That DVD arrived in the post a week after the funeral. But it was too late! The bailiffs had visited! What were we supposed to do?\u201d She's stroking the whippet harder and harder, until, with a sudden yelp, it escapes from her grasp. \u201cSo... what did we do?\u201d \u201cWe would have had to sell up. Move to another area. Amy would have been taken out of school...\u201d Her hands 322 are fluttering around her face again. \u201cSo my brother very kindly stepped in. And so did my sister. And... and so did you. You said you'd pay off the mortgage. As much as you could afford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p> <p>I sink back into the sofa, my mind reeling with shock, trying to fit this into the picture. I agreed to pay off Dad's debts. \u201cIs it an offshore mortgage?\u201d I say suddenly. \u201cIs the bank called Uni... something?\u201d She nods. \u201cMost of Daddy's dealings were offshore. Trying to avoid the tax man. I don't know why he couldn't just be honest\u201d \u201cSaid the woman who kept her daughter in the dark!\u201d expostulates Jon. \u201cHow can you even say that?\u201d I can't help catching some of his exasperation. \u201cMum, you knew I couldn't remember the funeral. You didn't tell me any of this. Can't you see how it might have... made things clearer for me? I had no idea where that money was going.\u201d \u201cIt's been very difficult!\u201d Mum's eyes are swiveling from side to side. \u201cI've been trying to keep it quiet for Amy's sake.\u201d \u201cBut\u201d I break off as something else even darker occurs to me. \u201cMum... I have another question. Was Dad ever in prison?\u201d Mum winces as though I've trodden on her toe. \u201cBriefly, darling. A long time ago... It was a misunderstanding. Let's not dwell on that. I'll make some more coffee.\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d In frustration I leap to my feet and stand right in front of her, trying to get her single-?minded attention. \u201cMum, listen! You can't just live in a bubble, pretending nothing's happened. Amy's right! You have to break out of this... this time warp.\u201c \u201dLexi!\u201c Mum says sharply, but I ignore her. \u201dAmy heard about Dad going to prison. She got the idea it's cool. No wonder she's been getting in so much trouble Jesus!\u201d Suddenly the pieces of my life are slotting together like a Tetris puzzle. \u201cThat's why I suddenly got ambitious. That's why I was so single-?minded. That funeral changed everything.\u201d \u201cYou told me what happened,\u201d Jon says. \u201cWhen the bailiffs arrived, she went to bits.\u201d He glances scornfully at Mum. \u201cYou had to hold them off, Lexi; you had to make the decisions. You took it all on yourself.\u201d \u201cStop looking at me as though it's all my fault!\u201d Mum suddenly cries out, her voice shrill and quivering. \u201cStop heaping blame on me! You have no idea about my life, none! Your father, that man\u201d She breaks off, the words hanging in the air, and I catch my breath as her blue eyes meet mine. For the first time that I can remember, my mother sounds... true. The room is totally still. I hardly dare speak. \u201cWhat about Dad?\u201d My sotto voce whisper still feels too loud. \u201cMum, tell me.\u201d But it's too late. Already the moment's over. Mum's eyes are shifting sideways, avoiding me. With a sudden pang I see her as though for the first time: her hair girlish in its Alice band, her hands wrinkled, Dad's ring still on her finger. Even as I watch, she's feeling for a dog's head and starting to pat it. \u201cIt's nearly lunchtime, Agnes!\u201d Her voice is bright and brittle. \u201cLet's see what we can find you\u201d \u201cMum, please.\u201d I take a step forward. \u201cYou can't stop there. What were you going to say?\u201d 324 I don't know what exactly I'm hoping forbut as she looks up I can tell I'm not going to get it. Her face is opaque again, as though nothing just happened. \u201cI was simply going to say\u201dalready she's regaining her old martyred spirit\u201cthat before you start blaming me for everything in your life, Lexi, that chap had a lot to answer for. That boyfriend of yours at the funeral. Dave? David? He's the one you should be accusing.\u201d \u201cLoser Dave?\u201d I stare at her, thrown. \u201cBut...Loser Dave wasn't at the funeral. He told me he offered to come but I turned him down. He said...\u201d I peter out as I see Jon just shaking his head, his eyes raised to heaven. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat else did he tell you?\u201d \u201cHe said we broke up that morning, and that it was beautiful, and that he gave me a single rose...\u201d Oh God.

Whipping my mobile phone from my pocket, I direct-?dial Loser Dave's office. \u201cAuto Repair Workshop,\u201d comes his businesslike voice down the line. \u201cDave Lewis at your service.\u201d \u201cLoser Dave, it's me,\u201d I say, my voice steely. \u201cLexi. I need to hear about our breakup again. And this time I need to hear the truth.\u201d \u201cBabe, I told you the truth.\u201d He sounds supremely confident. \u201cYou're going to have to trust me on this one.\u201d I want to wallop him. \u201cListen, you fuckhead,\u201d I say in slow, furious tones. \u201cI'm at the neurological specialist's office right now, okay? They say someone has been giving me wrong information and it's messing up my neural memory pathways. And if it isn't corrected, I'll get permanent brain damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d He sounds shaken. \u201cStraight up?\u201d He really is stupider than one of Mum's whippets. \u201cYeah. The specialist's with me right now, trying to correct my memory circuits. So maybe you want to try again with the truth? Or maybe you'd like to speak to the doctor?\u201d \u201cNo! Okay!\u201d He sounds totally unnerved. I can just picture him breathing harder, running a finger around his collar. \u201cMaybe it wasn't exactly like I told you. I was trying to protect you.\u201d \u201cProtect me from what? Did you come to the funeral?\u201d \u201cYeah, I came along,\u201d he says after a pause. \u201cI was handing out canapes. Being helpful. Giving you support.\u201d \u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d \u201cThen I . . . \u201d He clears his throat. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cShagged one of the waitresses. It was the emotional stress!\u201d he adds defensively. \u201cIt makes us all do crazy things. I thought I'd locked the door\u201d</p><p>\u201cI walked in on you?\u201d I say in disbelief. \u201cYeah. We weren't naked or anything. Well, obviously a bit\u201d \u201cStop!\u201d I thrust the phone away from me. I need a few moments to take all this in. Breathing hard, I crunch over the gravel, sit down on the garden wall, and look at the field of sheep opposite, ignoring the \u201cLexi! Lexi!\u201d coming from the phone. I caught Loser Dave two-?timing me. Well, of course I did. I'm not even that surprised. At last I lift the phone back to my ear. \u201cSo, how did I react? And don't say I gave you a rose and it was beautiful.\u201d \u201cWell.\u201d Loser Dave breathes out. \u201cTo be honest, you went ballistic. You started yelling about your life. Your 326 whole life had to change, it was all crap, you hated me, you hated everything I'm telling you, Lexi, it was extreme. I tried to calm you down, give you a prawn sandwich. But you weren't interested. You stormed out.\u201d \u201cThen what?\u201d \u201cThen I didn't see you again. Next time I clapped eyes on you, you were on the telly, looking totally different.\u201d \u201cRight.\u201d I watch two birds circling in the sky. \u201cYou know, you could have told me the truth, first time around.\u201d \u201cI know. I'm sorry.\u201d \u201cYeah, right.\u201d \u201cNo, I am.\u201d He sounds as genuine as I've ever heard him. \u201cAnd I'm sorry I shagged that girl. And I'm sorry for what she called you, that was well out of order.\u201d I sit up, suddenly alert. \u201cWhat did she call me?\u201d \u201cOh. You don't remember,\u201d he says hastily. \u201cEr... nothing. I don't remember either.\u201d \u201cWhat was it?\u201d I stand up, clutching the phone tighter. \u201cTell me what she called me! Loser Dave!\u201d \u201cI gotta go. Good luck with the doctor.\u201d He rings off. I immediately redial his number, but it's busy. Little sod. I march into the house to find Jon still sitting on the sofa, reading a copy of Whippet World. \u201cHi!\u201d His face lights up. \u201cHow did it go?\u201d \u201cWhat did the waitress call me at the funeral?\u201d</p><p>At once Jon looks evasive. \u201cI don't know what you mean. Hey, have you ever read Whippet World?\u201d He holds it up. \u201cBecause it's a surprisingly good\u201d \u201cYou do know what I mean.\u201d I sit down beside him and pull his chin around so he has to look at me. \u201cI know I told you. Tell me.\u201d Jon sighs. \u201cLexi, it's a tiny detail. Why does it matter?\u201d \u201cBecause... it just does. Look, Jon, you can't lecture my mum about denial and then not tell me something which happened in my own life, which I deserve to know. Tell me what that waitress called me. Now.\u201c I glare at him. \u201dAll right!\u201c Jon lifts his hands as though in defeat. \u201dIf you have to know, she called you... Dracula.\u201c Dracula? In spite of myselfin spite of the fact that I know my teeth aren't snaggly anymoreI can feel my cheeks staining with mortification. \u201dLexi\u201c Jon's wincing, as he reaches for my hand. \u201dNo.\u201c I shake him off. \u201dI'm fine.\u201d My face still hot, I stand up and head over to the window, trying to picture the scene, trying to put myself back in my own chewed-?up, flat-?heeled Lexi shoes. It's 2004. I didn't get a bonus. It's my dad's funeral. The bailiffs have just arrived to bankrupt us. I come across my boyfriend screwing a waitress... and she takes one look at me and calls me Dracula. Okay. Things are starting to make sense.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 18</p><p>On the way back, I sit in silence for a long, long while.

Jon glances at me every now and then but doesn't speak.</p><p>I'm going around and around it all in my head, trying to digest everything I've just learned. I feel like I've done a degree in Lexi Smart, in the space of half an hour. \u201cI still can't believe my dad left us in trouble like that,\u201d I say at last. \u201cWith no warning or anything.\u201d \u201cOh no?\u201d Jon sounds noncommittal. Kicking off my shoes, I draw my feet up onto the seat and rest my chin on my knees, gazing out at the road. \u201cYou know, everyone loved my dad. He was so good-?looking, and fun, and sparky, and he loved us. Even though he fucked up a few times, he really did love us. He used to call us his three girls.\u201d \u201cHis three girls.\u201d Jon's voice is drier than ever. \u201cA dog-?obsessive in denial, a teenage extortionist, and a screwed-?up amnesiac. And all of them in debt. Good work, Michael. Nicely done.\u201c I shoot him a look. \u201dYou don't think much of my dad, do you?\u201c \u201dI think he had a good time and left the pieces for all of you to deal with,\u201c says Jon. \u201dI think he was a selfish prick. But hey, I never met the guy.\u201c Abruptly he signals and pulls into another lane. His hands are gripping the wheel tightly, I suddenly notice. He seems almost angry. \u201dAt least I get myself a bit more.\u201c I chew on my thumbnail. \u201dDid I ever talk to you about it? The funeral?\u201c \u201dOnce or twice.\u201c Jon gives me a wry smile. \u201dOh, right.\u201c I color. \u201dAll the time. I must have bored you to death.\u201c \u201dDon't be stupid.\u201d He takes a hand off the wheel and squeezes mine briefly. \u201cOne day, really early on, when we were still just friends, it all came out. The whole story. How that day changed your life. How you took on your family's debt, booked a cosmetic dentistry appointment the next day, went on a crash diet, decided to change everything about yourself. Then you went on TV and everything became even more extreme. You rocketed up the career ladder you met Eric, and he seemed like the answer. He was solid, rich, stable. A million miles away from...\u201c He breaks off into silence. \u201dMy dad,\u201d I say eventually.</p><p>\u201cI'm no psychologist. But I would guess.\u201d There's silence. I watch a small plane heading higher and higher into the sky, leaving a double trail of white smoke. \u201cYou know, when I woke up, I thought I'd landed the dream life,\u201d I say slowly. \u201cI thought I was Cinderella. I was better than Cinderella. I thought I must be the happiest girl in the world...\u201d I break off as Jon shakes his head. 330 \u201cYou were living your whole life under a strain. You went too far too soon; you didn't know how to handle it; you made mistakes.\u201d He hesitates. \u201cYou alienated your friends. You found that the hardest of all.\u201d \u201cBut I don't understand,\u201d I say helplessly. \u201cI don't understand why I became a bitch.\u201d \u201cYou didn't mean to. Lexi, give yourself a break. You were thrust into this boss position. You had a big department to run, you wanted to impress senior management, not be accused of favoritism... and you floundered. You did some things the wrong way. Then you felt trapped. You'd built up this tough persona. It was part of your success.\u201d \u201cThe Cobra,\u201d I say, wincing. I still can't believe I got nicknamed after a snake. \u201cThe Cobra.\u201d He nods, a smile pushing at his mouth again. \u201cYou know, that was the TV producers' idea. That wasn't you. Although they had somethingyou are pretty cobra-?like when it comes to business.\u201d \u201cNo, I'm not!\u201d I lift my head in horror. \u201cIn a good way.\u201d He grins. A good way? How can you be like a cobra in a good way? We drive on for a while without speaking, golden fields sprawling into the distance on either side of us. At length Jon turns on the radio. The Eagles are playing \u201cHotel California\u201d and as we zip along, sunlight glinting off the windshield, I suddenly feel like we could be in another country. Another life. \u201cYou once said to me, if you could go back in time and do everything differently, you would.\u201d Jon's voice is softer than before. \u201cWith everything. Yourself ...your job... Eric... Everything looks different when the gloss is gone.\u201d I feel a sudden sting at the mention of Eric. Jon's talking like everything's in the pastbut this is now. I'm married. Nor do I like what he's implying. \u201cLook, I'm not some shallow gold-?digger, okay?\u201d I say hotly. \u201cI must have loved Eric. I wouldn't just marry a guy because of the gloss.\u201d \u201cAt first you thought Eric was the real deal,\u201d Jon agrees. \u201cHe's charming, he ticks the boxes... In fact, he's like one of the intelligent systems from our lofts. Put him on 'Husband' setting and away he goes.\u201d \u201cStop it.\u201d \u201cHe's state-?of-?the-?art. He has a range of mood settings; he's touch sensitive...\u201d \u201cStop it.\u201d I'm trying not to laugh. I lean forward and turn the radio up higher, as though to block Jon out. A moment later I've worked out what I want to say, and turn it down again. \u201cOkay, look. Maybe we did have an affair. In the past. But that doesn't mean... Maybe I want to make my marriage work this time around.\u201d \u201cYou can't make it work.\u201d Jon doesn't miss a beat. \u201cEric doesn't love you.\u201d Why does he have to be such a bloody know-?it-?all? \u201cYes, he does.\u201d I fold my arms. \u201cHe told me so. In fact, it was really romantic, if you want to know.\u201d \u201cOh yeah?\u201d Jon doesn't sound remotely fazed. \u201cWhat'd he say?\u201d \u201cHe said he fell in love with my beautiful mouth and my long legs and the way I swing my briefcase.\u201c I can't help coloring with self-?consciousness. I've always remembered Eric saying that, in fact I memorized it on the spot. \u201dThat's a crock of shit.\u201d Jon doesn't even turn.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt's not a crock of shit!\u201d I retort indignantly. \u201cIt's romantic!\u201d 332 \u201cOh, really?

I can't turn it into a list\u201d he says, almost scathingly. There's a long pause. I'm staring straight ahead, my arms still folded tightly. Jon's focused on the road, as though he's already forgotten the conversation. We're getting nearer London now, and the traffic is thickening up around us. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says finally, as we draw to a halt in a queue of cars. \u201cI like the way you squeak in your sleep.\u201d \u201cI squeak in my sleep?\u201d I say disbelievingly. \u201cLike a chipmunk.\u201d \u201cI thought I was supposed to be a cobra,\u201d I retort. \u201cMake up your mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCobra by day.\u201d He nods. \u201cChipmunk by night.\u201d I'm trying to keep my mouth straight and firm, but a smile is edging out. As we crawl along the dual carriageway, my phone beeps with a text and I pull it out. \u201cIt's Eric,\u201d I say after reading it. \u201cHe's arrived safely in Manchester. He's scoping out some possible new sites for a few days.\u201d \u201cUh-?huh. I know.\u201d Jon swings around a roundabout. We're into the outskirts of the city now. The air seems 333 grayer and a spot of rain suddenly hits me on the cheek. I shiver, and Jon puts the roof of the Mercedes back up. His face is set as he negotiates the lanes of the dual carriageway. \u201cYou know, Eric could have paid off your dad's debt in his sleep,\u201c he suddenly says, his voice matter-?of-?fact. \u201dBut he left you to it. Never even mentioned it.\u201d I feel at a loss. I don't know how to reply to that; I don't know what to think.</p><p>\u201cIt's his money,\u201d I say at last. \u201cWhy should he? And anyway, I don't need anyone's help.\u201d \u201cI know. I offered. You wouldn't take anything. You're pretty stubborn.\u201d He reaches a big junction, draws up behind a bus, and turns to look at me. \u201cI don't know what you're planning now.\u201c \u201dNow?\u201c \u201dThe rest of today.\u201c He shrugs. \u201dIf Eric's away.\u201c Deep within me, something starts stirring. A gentle pulsing, which I don't want to admit to. Even to myself. \u201dWell.\u201c I try to sound businesslike. \u201dI wasn't planning anything. Just go home, have some supper, read through this folder...\u201c I force myself to leave a natural pause before I add, \u201dWhy?\u201c \u201dNothing.\u201c Jon leaves a pause too, and frowns ahead at the road before he adds casually, \u201dIt's just there's some stuff of yours at my flat. You might want to pick it up.\u201c \u201dOkay.\u201c I shrug noncommittally. \u201dOkay.\u201c He swings the car around and we travel the rest of the way in silence. Jon lives in the most beautiful flat I've ever seen. Okay, it's in a daggy street in Hammersmith. And you have to ignore the graffiti on the wall opposite. But the 334 house is big and pale brick, with massive old arched windows, and it turns out that the flat runs into the next-?door building too, so it's a million times wider than it seems from the outside. \u201dThis i s . . . amazing.\u201d I'm standing, looking around his workspace, almost speechless. The ceiling is high and the walls are white and there's a tall, sloped desk covered in paper, next to a workstation bearing a massive Apple Mac. In the corner is a drawing easel, and opposite is an entire wall covered in books, with an old-?fashioned library ladder on wheels.</p><p>\u201cThis whole row of houses was built as artists' studios.\u201d Jon's eyes are gleaming as he walks around, picking up about ten old coffee cups and disappearing with them into a tiny kitchen.</p><p>The sun has come out again and is glinting through the arched windows onto the reclaimed floorboards. Discarded pieces of paper are on the floor, covered in lines, drawings, sketches. Plonked in the middle of all the work is a bottle of tequila next to a packet of almonds. I look up to see Jon standing in the kitchen doorway, watching me soundlessly. He ruffles his hair as though to break some mood, and says, \u201cYour stuff's through here.\u201d I walk where he's pointing, through an archway into a cozy sitting room. It's furnished with big blue cotton sofas and a massive leather bean bag and an old TV balanced on a chair. Behind the sofa are battered wooden shelves, haphazardly filled with books and magazines and plants and... \u201cThat's my mug.\u201d I stare at a hand-?painted red pottery mug that Fi once gave me for my birthday, sitting on the shelves like it belongs there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Jon nods. \u201cThat's what I mean. You left stuff here.\u201d He picks it up and hands it to me. \u201cAnd...my sweater!\u201d There's an old ribbed polo neck draped over one of the sofas. I've had it forever, since I was about sixteen. How come I look around in disbelief as more things spring into my vision, like a Magic Eye. That furry fake-?wolf throw that I always used to wrap around myself. Old college photos in their beaded frames. My pink retro toaster? \u201cYou used to come here and eat toast.\u201d Jon follows my astonished gaze. \u201cYou used to cram it in like you were starving.\u201d I'm suddenly seeing the other side of me; the side I thought had disappeared forever. For the first time since I woke up in hospital I feel like I'm at home. There's even a string of fairy lights draped around the plant in the corner; the same fairy lights I had in my little flat in Balham. All this time, all my stuff was here. Suddenly I have a memory of Eric's words, that first time I asked him about Jon. You'd trust Jon with your life.</p><p>Maybe that's what I did. Trusted him with my life. \u201cDo you remember anything?\u201d Jon sounds casual, but I can sense the hope underneath. \u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cJust the stuff that came from my life before...\u201d I break off as I notice a beaded frame I don't recognize. I move closer to see the pictureand feel a tiny jolt. It's a photo of me. And Jon. We're sitting on a tree trunk and his arms are around me and I'm wearing old jeans and sneakers. My hair is streaming down my back; my head is tossed back. I'm laughing as though I'm the happiest girl there ever was. It was real. It was really real. 336 My head is prickling as I stare at our faces, bleached by the sunshine. All this time, he had proof. \u201cYou could have shown me this,\u201d I say almost accusingly. \u201cThis photo. You could have brought it along the first time we met.\u201d \u201cWould you have believed me?\u201d He sits on the arm of the sofa. \u201cWould you have wanted to believe me?\u201d I'm halted. Maybe he's right. Maybe I would have explained it away, rationalized it, clung to my perfect husband, my dream life. Trying to lighten the atmosphere, I walk over to a table cluttered with old novels belonging to me and a bowl of seeds. \u201cSunflower seeds.\u201d I grab a handful. \u201cI love sunflower seeds.\u201d \u201cI know you do.\u201d Jon has the oddest, most unfathomable expression on his face. \u201cWhat?\u201d I look at him in surprise, seeds halfway to my mouth. \u201cWhat's wrong? Are these okay?\u201d \u201cThey're fine. There was something...\u201d He breaks off and smiles, as though to himself. \"No. It doesn't matter.</p><p>Forget it.\u201c \u201dWhat?\u201c I frown, bewildered. \u201dSomething from our relationship? You have to tell me. Go on.\u201c \u201dIt's nothing.\u201c He shrugs. \u201dIt was stupid. We just had this... tradition. The first time we had sex you'd been munching on sunflower seeds. You planted one in a yogurt pot and I took it home. It was like our own private joke. Then we started doing it every time. As a memento. We called them our children.\u201c \u201dWe planted sunflowers?\u201c I wrinkle my brow with interest. That rings a tiny bell. 337 \u201dUh-?huh.\u201c Jon nods, like he wants to change the subject. \u201dLet me get you a drink.\u201c \u201dSo where are they?\u201c I say as he pours out two glasses of wine. \u201dDid you keep any of them?\u201c I'm looking around the room for signs of seedlings in yogurt pots. \u201dIt doesn't matter.\u201c He hands me a glass. \u201dDid you throw them away?\u201c \u201dNo, I didn't throw them away.\u201c He heads over to a CD player and puts on some low music, but I won't be put off. \u201dWhere are they, then?\u201c A challenging note creeps into my voice. \u201dWe must have had sex a few times, if everything you say is true. So there should be a few sunflower plants.\u201c Jon takes a sip of his wine. Then without saying a word he turns on his heel and gestures for me to walk along a small corridor. We head through a sparsely decorated bedroom. There he pushes open double doors to a wide, decked balcony. And I catch my breath. There's a wall of sunflowers all the way around. From huge yellow monsters reaching up to the sky, down to young flowers, tethered to canes, down to spindly green shoots in tiny pots, just starting to open. Everywhere I look, I can see sunflowers. This was it. This was us. From the very beginning to the latest scrappy seedling in a pot. My throat is suddenly tight as I gaze around at the sea of green and yellow. I had no idea. \u201dSo, how long ago... I mean...\u201c I jerk my head at the tiniest seedling, in a tiny painted pot, propped up with sticks. \u201cSince we last...\u201d \u201cSix weeks ago. The day before the crash.\u201d Jon pauses, an unreadable expression on his face. \u201cI'm kind of looking after that one.\u201d 338 \u201cWas that the last time I saw you before...\u201d I bite my lip. There's a beat of silence, then Jon nods. \u201cThat's the last time we were together.\u201d I sit down and gulp at my wine, feeling totally overwhelmed. There's a whole story here. A whole relationship. Growing and thickening and turning into something so strong I was going to leave Eric. \u201cWhat about...the first time?\u201d I say eventually. \u201cHow did it all start?\u201d \u201cIt was that weekend Eric was away. I was over and we were chatting. We were out on the balcony, drinking wine. Kind of like we are now.\u201d Jon gestures around. \u201cAnd then halfway through the afternoon we fell silent. And we knew.\u201d He lifts his dark eyes to mine and I feel a lurch, deep inside. He gets up and starts walking toward me. \u201cWe both knew it was inevitable,\u201d he says softly. I'm transfixed. Gently he removes the wineglass from my hand and takes hold of both my hands. \u201cLexi...\u201d He brings my hands up to his mouth, closing his eyes, gently kissing them. \u201cI knew...\u201d His voice is muffled against my skin. \u201cYou'd come back. I knew you'd come back to me.\u201d \u201cStop it!\u201d I whip my hands away, my heart thudding in distress. \u201cYou don't...you don't know anything!\u201d \u201cWhat's wrong?\u201d Jon looks as shell-?shocked as though I'd hit him. I almost don't know what's wrong myself. I want him so badly; my entire body's telling me to go for it. But I can't. \u201cWhat's wrong i s . . . I'm freaked.\u201d \u201cBy what?\u201d He looks dumbfounded. \u201cBy all this!\u201d I gesture at the sunflowers. \u201dIt's too much. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>You're presenting me with this... this fully fledged relationship.</p><p>But for me, it's just the beginning.\u201c I take a deep gulp of wine, trying to keep my cool. \u201dI'm too many steps behind. It's too unbalanced.\u201c \u201dWe'll balance it,\u201c he says quickly. \u201dWe'll work it out. I'll go back to the beginning too.\u201c \u201dYou can't go back to the beginning!\u201c I thrust my hands hopelessly through my hair. \u201dJon, you're a guy who's attractive and witty and cool. And I really like you. But I don't love you. How could I? I haven't done all this. I don't remember all this.\u201c \u201dI don't expect you to love me\u201c \u201dYes, you do. You do! You expect me to be her.\u201c \u201dYou are her.\u201c There's a sudden streak of anger in his voice. \u201dDon't give me this bullshit. You're the girl I love. Believe it, Lexi.\u201c \u201dI don't know!\u201c My voice rises in agitation. \u201dI don't know if I am, okay? Am I her? Am I me?\u201c To my horror, tears are streaming down my face; I have no idea where they came from. I turn away and wipe my face, gulping, unable to stop the torrent. I want to be her, I want to be the girl laughing on the tree trunk. But I'm not. At last I manage to get a grip on myself and turn around. Jon is standing in exactly the same place as he was before, a bleakness on his face that makes my heart constrict. \u201dI look around at these sunflowers.\u201c I swallow hard. \u201dAnd the photos. And all my things here. And I can see that it happened. But it looks like a wonderful romance between two people I don't know.\u201c \u201dIt's you,\u201c says Jon in a quiet voice. \u201dIt's me. You know both of us.\u201c \u201dI know it in my head. But I don't feel it. I don't know it.\u201c 340 I clench a fist on my chest, feeling the tears rising again. \u201dIf I could just remember one thing. If there was one memory, one thread...\u201c I trail off in silence. Jon is gazing at the sunflowers as though rapt by every petal. \u201dSo, what are you saying?\u201c \u201dI'm saying... I don't know! I don't know. I need time... I need...\" I break off helplessly.</p><p>Spots of rain are starting to fall on the balcony. A breeze gusts past and the sunflowers sway against each other as though they're nodding. At last Jon breaks the silence. \u201cA lift home?\u201d He lifts his eyes to meet mineand there's no anger anymore. \u201cYes.\u201d I wipe my eyes and push my hair back. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>It only takes fifteen minutes to reach home. We don't chat. I sit holding on to the blue folder and Jon changes gear, his jaw set. He pulls the Mercedes into my parking space, and for a moment neither of us moves. Rain is thundering against the roof by now and there's a sudden crash of lightning. \u201cYou'll have to run straight in,\u201d Jon says, and I nod.</p> <p>\u201cHow will you get back?\u201d \u201cI'll be fine.\u201d He hands me my keys, avoiding my eye. \u201cGood luck with that.\u201d He nods at the folder. \u201cI mean it.\u201d \u201cThanks.\u201d I run a hand over the cardboard, biting my lip. \u201cAlthough I don't know how I'm going to get to Simon Johnson to talk about it. I've been demoted. I've lost all my credibility. He won't be interested.\u201d \u201cYou'll do it.\u201d \u201cIf I can get in to speak to him, it'll be fine. But I know I'll be fobbed off. They have no time for me anymore.\u201d I sigh and reach for the car door. The rain is totally sheeting down, but I can't sit here all night. \u201cLexi...\u201d I feel a flurry of nerves at Jon's tone. \u201cLet's... talk,\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cSometime.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d He holds my gaze for a moment. \u201cSometime. It's a deal.\u201d He gets out, lifting his hands ineffectually against the rain. \u201cI'm going to find a cab. Go on, run.\u201d He hesitates, then drops a kiss on my cheek and strides away. I pelt through the rain to the entrance, nearly dropping the precious folder, then stand under the portico, gathering the papers together, feeling a fresh spasm of hope as I remember the details. Although what I said was true. If I can't see Simon Johnson it will all be for nothing. And all of a sudden I sag as the reality of my situation hits home. I don't know what I've been thinking. Whatever I have in this folder, he's never going to give me another chance, is he? I'm not the Cobra anymore. I'm not Lexi the talented whiz kid. I'm the memorily challenged, embarrassment-?to-?the-?firm, total fuckup. Simon Johnson won't even give me five minutes, let alone a full hearing. I'm not in the mood for the lift. To the obvious astonishment of the doorman, I head for the stairwell and trudge up the gleaming steel-?and-?glass stairs that not a single resident of this block ever uses. Once inside, I put on the remotecontrol fire and try to hunker up on the cream sofa. But the cushions are all shiny and awkward, and I'm afraid of my rain-?damp head leaving a stain on the fabric, so in the end I get up and head to the kitchen to make a cup of tea. After all the adrenaline of the day I'm leaden with disappointment. So I learned a few things about myself. So what? I got totally carried away, with Jon, with the deal, 342 with everything. This whole day has been a pipe dream. I'm never going to save the Flooring department. Simon's never going to usher me into his office and ask me what I think, let alone pitch a deal. Never in a million years. Not unless... Not unless... No. I couldn't. Could I? I'm frozen in a disbelieving excitement, thinking through the implications, with Simon Johnson's voice running through my head like a soundtrack. If you recovered your memory, Lexi, then things would be different. If I recovered my memory, then things would be different. The kettle is coming to the boil, but I don't even notice. As though in a dream, I pull out my mobile phone and direct dial. \u201cFi,\u201d I say as soon as it's answered. \u201cDon't say anything. Listen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 19</p><p>Think bitch. Think boss. Think Cobra, I survey myself in the mirror and put on some more lipstick. It's a pale gray-?pink shade that could practically be called \u201cBitch-?boss-?from-?hell.\u201d My hair's scraped back and I'm wearing the most severe outfit I could find in my wardrobe: the slimmest pencil skirt; the pointiest pumps; a white shirt striped with gray. There's no mistaking the message this outfit conveys: I mean business. I spent two hours with Jeremy Northpool yesterday at his office in Reading, and every time I think of it, I experience a tiny thrill. Everything's in place: We both want this deal to work out. Now it's up to me. \u201cYou don't look mean enough.\u201d Fi, standing by my side in a navy trouser suit, surveys me critically. \u201cTry scowling more.\u201d I screw my nose upbut now I just look like I want to sneeze. \u201cNope.\u201d Fi shakes her head. \u201cThat's still not 344 right. You used to have this really chilling stare. Like, 'You are an insignificant minion, get out of my way instantly.'\u201d She narrows her eyes and puts on a hard, dismissive voice. \u201cI'm the boss and I'll have things done my way.\u201d \u201cThat's really good!\u201d I turn in admiration. \u201cYou should do this. We'll swap.\u201d \u201cYeah, right.\u201d She pushes my shoulder. \u201cGo on, do it again. Scowl.\u201d \u201cGet out of my way, you minion,\u201d I snarl in a Wicked Witch of the West voice. \u201cI'm the boss and I'll have things done my way.\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d She applauds. \u201cThat's better. And kind of flick your eyes past people, like you can't even waste time acknowledging they're there.\u201d I sigh and flop down on the bed. All this bitchy behavior is exhausting. \u201cI was a real cow, wasn't I?\u201d \u201cYou weren't as bad as that all the time.\u201d Fi relents. \u201cBut we can't run any risks of people guessing. The meaner the better.\u201d Fi has been coaching me for the last twenty-?four hours. She took a sick day yesterday and came over, bringing breakfast with her. In the end we were so engrossed, she stayed all day, and the night. And she's done the most brilliant job. I know everything. I know what happened at last year's Christmas party. I know that at a meeting last year, Byron stormed out and called me an arrogant nobody. I know that vinyl sales went up two percent last March, due to an order from a school in Wokingham, which then complained that the color was wrong and tried to sue us.</p><p>My head is so crammed full of facts it's ready to burst. And that's not even the most important bit. \u201cWhen you go into your office, always slam the door.\u201d Fi is still instructing me. \u201cThen come out and demand a coffee. In that order.\u201d The most important bit is that I come across like the old bitch-?boss Lexi and fool everyone. I put away my lipstick and pick up my briefcase. \u201cGet me a coffee,\u201d I bark at myself. \u201cAt once!\u201d \u201cNarrow your eyes even more.\u201d Fi surveys me, then nods. \u201cYou're set.\u201d \u201cFi...thanks.\u201d I turn and give her a hug. \u201cYou're a star.\u201d \u201cIf you pull this off you'll be a star.\u201d She hesitates, then adds, a little gruffly, \u201cEven if you don't pull it off. You didn't have to make all this effort, Lexi. I know they're offering you a big job, even if they close the department.\u201d \u201cYeah, well.\u201d I rub my nose awkwardly. \u201cThat's not the point. Come on, let's go.\u201d As we travel to the office in a cab, my stomach is clenched up with nerves and I can't make small talk. I'm crazy, doing this. I know I'm crazy. But it's the only way I can think of. \u201cJesus, I've got stage fright,\u201d Fi murmurs as we draw up. \u201cAnd it's not even me doing it. I don't know how I'm going to keep a straight face in front of Debs and Carolyn.\u201d We haven't told the others what I'm up to. We reckon the fewer people that know, the safer. \u201cWell, Fi, you'll just have to make an effort, okay?\u201d I snap in my new-?Lexi voice, and nearly giggle as her face jerks in shock. \u201cGod, that's scary. You're good.\u201d We get out of the cab, and I hand the driver the fare, practicing my mean-?eyed glare as I collect my change. \u201cLexi?\u201d A voice comes from behind me. I look around, 346 all ready to launch my scary-?Lexi face on some unsuspecting personbut instead feel it drop in astonishment. \u201cAmy? What the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI've been waiting for you.\u201d She smooths a strand of hair back a little defiantly. \u201cI'm here to be your intern.\u201d \u201cYou... what?\u201d As the taxi drives away, I goggle at her. She's dressed in teetering high heels, fishnets, a tiny pin-?striped miniskirt with a matching waistcoat, and her blue-?streaked hair in a ponytail. On her lapel is a badge reading You don't have to be crazy to work here but it helps if you're a hot lesbian. \u201cAmy...\u201d I put my hand to my head. \u201cToday really isn't a good day\u201c \u201dYou said!\u201c Her voice quivers. \u201dYou said you'd sort it out. I've made a real effort to get here. I got up early and everything. Mum was really pleased. She said you'd be pleased too.\u201c \u201dI am pleased! But of all the days...\u201c \u201dThat's what you said last time. You're not really interested.\u201c She turns away and yanks her ponytail free. \u201dFine. I don't want your stupid crappy job anyway.\u201c \u201dShe might be a distraction,\u201c Fi says beside me in a low voice. \u201dIt might actually be a good idea. Can we trust her?\u201c \u201dTrust me?\u201c Amy's voice sharpens with interest. \u201dWith what?\u201c She comes over, her eyes shining. \u201dHave you guys got a secret?\u201c \u201dOkay.\u201c I make a snap decision. \u201dListen, Amy.\u201c I lower my voice. \u201dYou can come in, but here's the thing. I'm telling everyone I've recovered my memory and I'm my old self, to get a deal done. Even though I haven't. Got it?\u201d Amy doesn't bat an eyelid. I can see her mind working furiously, taking all this in. There are some advantages to having a scam artist as a little sister.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo you're trying to make out you're the old Lexi,\u201d she says. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThen you should look meaner.\u201d \u201cThat's what I said,\u201d agrees Fi. \u201cLike you think everyone is just a . . . worm.\u201d \u201cExactly.\u201d They both sound so sure, I feel a pang of hurt. \u201cWas I ever nice?\u201d I say, a bit plaintively.</p><p>\u201cEr...yes!\u201d Fi says unconvincingly. \u201cPlenty of times.

For your information, I'm fully recovered and if you've got any mail for me I want to know why it isn't upstairs already.\u201d \u201cExcellent!\u201d whispers Fi by my side. \u201cThere's nothing for you, Lexi.\u201d Jenny seems taken aback as she fills out a pass for Amy. \u201cSo... you remember everything now, do you?\u201d \u201cEverything. Come on, Fi. We're late enough already. I need to talk to the team. They've been slacking.\u201d I stride away, toward the lifts. A moment later I can hear Jenny behind me, saying in an excited undertone, \u201cGuess what? Lexi's got her memory back!\u201d I turn backand sure enough, she's already on the phone to someone. The lift pings. Fi, Amy, and I walk inand as soon as the doors close, dissolve into giggles. \u201cHigh five!\u201d Fi lifts her hand. \u201cThat was great!\u201d We all get out at the eighth floor, and I head straight to 348 Natasha's desk outside Simon Johnson's office, my head high and imperious. \u201cHi, Natasha,\u201d I say curtly. \u201cI assume you got my message about my memory returning? Obviously I'll need to see Simon as soon as possible.\u201d \u201cYes, I got your message.\u201d Natasha nods. \u201cBut I'm afraid Simon's quite booked up this morning\u201d \u201cThen juggle things around! Cancel someone else! It's essential I see him.\u201d \u201cOkay!\u201d Natasha types hastily at her keyboard. \u201cI could do you a slot a t . . . ten-?thirty?\u201d \u201cFantast\u201d I stop as Fi nudges me. \u201cThat'll be fine,\u201d I amend, shooting Natasha my meanest scowl for good measure. \u201cCome on, Fi.\u201d God, this barking and snapping is a strain. It's getting me down and I've only been doing it for ten minutes. \u201cTen-?thirty,\u201d Amy says as we get back in the lift. \u201cThat's cool. Where do we go now?\u201d \u201cTo the Flooring department.\u201d I feel a stab of nerves. \u201cI'll have to keep this act up till ten-?thirty.\u201d \u201cGood luck.\u201d Fi squeezes my shoulder briefly, and the lift doors open. As we head along the corridor to the main office I feel slightly sick. I can do this, I tell myself, over and over. I can be a bitch boss. I arrive at the door and stand there for a few moments, surveying the scene before me. Then I draw a breath. \u201cSo.\u201d I summon a harsh, sarcastic voice. \u201cReading Hello! magazine is work, is it?\u201d Melanie, who had been flicking through Hello! with a telephone receiver under her chin, jumps as though she's been scalded and flames red.</p><p>\u201cI was just... waiting to be put through to Accounts.\u201d She hastily closes Hello! Til be speaking to you all about attitude later.\u201c I glare around the room. \u201dAnd that reminds me. Didn't I ask everyone to provide full written travel-?expense breakdowns two months ago? I want to see them.\u201c \u201dWe thought you'd forgotten,\u201c Carolyn says, looking dumbstruck. \u201dWell, I've remembered.\u201c I give her a sweet, scathing smile. \u201dI've remembered everything. And you might all remember that you're relying on me for references.\u201c I sweep out, almost straight into Byron. \u201dLexi!\u201c He nearly drops his cup of coffee. \u201dWhat the fuck\u201c \u201dByron. I need to talk to you about Tony Dukes,\u201c I say crisply. \u201dHow did you handle the discrepancy in his calculations? Because we all know his reputation for pulling a fast one. Remember the trouble we had in October 2006?\u201c Byron's mouth is hanging open stupidly. \u201dAnd I want to talk to you about our annual strategy conference. Last year's was a shambles.\u201c I head to my office, then turn around. \u201dSpeaking of which, where are the minutes of our last product meeting? You were doing them, as I remember.\u201c \u201dI'll... get those to you.\" He looks utterly gobsmacked. Everything I'm saying is hitting right home. Fi is a total genius!</p> <p>\u201cSo, are you recovered?\u201d Byron says as I open my office door. \u201cAre you back?\u201d \u201cOh yes. I'm back.\u201d I usher Amy in and slam the door. I count to three, then I look out again. \u201cClare, a coffee. And one for my temp, Amy. Fi, can you come in here?\u201d As Fi closes the door behind her, I collapse on the sofa, breathless. \u201cYou should be on the stage!\u201d Fi exclaims. \u201cThat was so great! That's just the way you used to be!\u201d I'm still cringing inside. I can't believe I said those things. \u201cSo now we just have to sit it out till ten-?thirty.\u201d Fi glances at her watch as she perches on my desk. \u201cIt's past ten now.\u201d \u201cYou were a real bitch out there,\u201d says Amy admiringly. She's taken out mascara and is applying yet another coat. \u201cThat's what I'll be like when I go into business.\u201d \u201cThen you won't make any friends.\u201d \u201cI don't want to make friends.\u201d She tosses her head. \u201cI want to make money. You know what Dad always said? He said\u201d Suddenly I really don't want to hear what Dad always said. \u201cAmy, we'll talk later.\u201d I cut her off. \u201cAbout Dad.\u201d There's a knock on the door and we all freeze. \u201cQuick!\u201d says Fi. \u201cGet behind the desk. Sound cross and impatient.\u201d I scuttle to the office chair, and she quickly pulls up a chair opposite. \u201cCome in,\u201d I call, trying to muster the most impatient tone I can. The door opens and Clare appears, holding a tray of coffee. Irritably I jerk my head at the desk. \u201cSo, Fi... I've had just enough of your attitude!\u201d I improvise as Clare unloads the coffee cups. \u201cIt's unacceptable. What have you got to say for yourself?\u201c \u201dSorry, Lexi,\u201d Fi mumbles, her head bowed. Suddenly I realize she's in fits of giggles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, well.\u201d I'm trying desperately to keep a straight face. \u201cI'm the boss. And I won't have you...\u201d Oh God, my brain is blank. What's she done? \u201cI won't have you... sitting on the desk!\u201d A kind of spluttery snort comes from Fi. \u201cSorry,\u201d she gasps, and clutches a hanky to her eyes. Clare looks absolutely petrified. \u201cUm... Lexi,\u201d she says, backing toward the door. \u201cI don't want to interrupt, but Lucinda is here? With her baby?\u201d Lucinda. That means nothing to me. Fi sits up, her giggles vanished. \u201cLucinda who worked for us last year, do you mean?\u201d she says quickly, glancing at me. \u201cI didn't know she was coming in today.\u201d \u201cWe're giving her a baby gift and we wondered if Lexi could present it to her?\u201d Clare gestures out the door and I see a small cluster around a blond woman holding a baby carrier. She looks up and waves. \u201cLexi! Come and see the baby!\u201d Shit. There's no way out of this one. I can't refuse to look at a babyit'll seem too weird. \u201cWell... all right,\u201d I say at last. \u201cJust for a moment.\u201d \u201cLucinda was with us about eight months,\u201d Fi murmurs frantically as we head out of the office. \u201cTook care of European accounts, mainly. Sat by the window, likes peppermint tea...\u201d \u201cHere we are.\u201d Clare hands me a huge gift-?wrapped parcel crowned with a satin bow. \u201cIt's a baby gym.\u201d As I draw near, the others back away. To be honest, I don't blame them. \u201cHi, Lexi.\u201d Lucinda looks up, glowing at all the attention. 352 \u201cHi there.\u201d I nod curtly at the baby, which is dressed in a white onesie. \u201cCongratulations, Lucinda. And this i s . . .a girl? A boy?\u201d \u201cHe's called Marcus!\u201d Lucinda appears offended. \u201cYou've met him before!\u201c Somehow I force myself to shrug disparagingly. \u201dI'm afraid I'm not into babies.\u201c \u201dShe eats them!\u201c I hear someone whisper. \u201dAnyway, on behalf of the department, I'd like to give you this.\u201c I hand the parcel over. \u201dSpeech!\u201c says Clare. \u201dThat's not necessary,\u201c I say with a forbidding glare. \u201dEveryone back to\u201c \u201dYes it is!\u201c Debs objects defiantly. \u201dThis is like Lucinda's leaving-?do too. She can't not have a speech.\u201c \u201dSpeech!\u201c calls someone at the back. \u201dSpeech!\u201c A couple of others start banging the desks. Oh God. I can't refuse. Bosses give speeches about their employees. This is what they do. \u201dOf course,\u201c I say at last, and clear my throat. \u201dWe're all very pleased for Lucinda on the birth of Marcus. But sad to say good-?bye to such a valued member of our team.\u201c I notice Byron joining the cluster of people, surveying me closely over his Lost mug. \u201dLucinda was always...\u201c I take a sip of coffee, playing for time. \u201dShe was always... by the window. Sipping her peppermint tea. Managing her European accounts.\u201c I glance up and see Fi at the back, frantically miming some kind of activity. \u201dWe all remember Lucinda for her love of... biking,\u201c I say uncertainly. \u201dBiking?\u201c Lucinda looks puzzled. \u201dDo you mean riding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Exactly. Riding,\u201d I amend hastily. \u201cAnd we all appreciated your efforts with those... French clients.\u201d \u201cI didn't deal with France.\u201d Lucinda is gazing at me in outrage. \u201cDid you ever even notice what I did?\u201d \u201cTell the story about Lucinda and the snooker table!\u201d calls out someone at the back, and there's a chorus of laughter. \u201cNo,\u201d I snap, rattled. \u201cSo.. .here's to Lucinda.\u201d I raise my coffee cup. \u201cDon't you remember the story, Lexi?\u201d Byron's bland voice comes from the side. I glance at himand feel a sudden hollowness inside. He's guessed. \u201cOf course I remember it.\u201d I summon my most cutting tones. \"But it's not the time for silly, irrelevant stories.</p><p>We should all be at work. Get back to your desks, everyone.\u201c \u201dGod, she's a hard bitch,\u201c I can hear Lucinda muttering. \u201dShe's even worse than before!\u201c \u201dWait!\u201c Byron's voice rises smoothly over the disgruntled muttering. \u201dWe forgot Lucinda's other present! The mother and baby spa voucher.\u201c He brings a slip of paper up to me with an overdeferential air. \u201dIt just needs Lucinda's name filled in, Lexi. You should do that, being head of the department.\"</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I take the pen. \u201cYou need to put the surname too,\u201d he adds casually as I take off the cap. I look up and his eyes are gleaming. Fuck. He's got me. \u201cOf course,\u201d I say briskly. \u201cLucinda... remind me what name you're using these days.\u201d \u201cThe same as before,\u201d she says resentfully, cradling her baby. \u201cMy maiden name.\u201d 354 \u201cRight.\u201d As slowly as I can, I write Lucinda on the dotted line. \u201cAnd the surname?\u201d Byron says, like a torturer turning the screw. I look up desperately at Fi, to see her mouthing something at me. Dobson? Dodgson? Holding my breath, I carefully write a D. Then I pause and stretch out my arm as though limbering it up. \u201cI've had problems with my wrist,\u201d I say to no one in particular. \u201cThe muscles sometimes get a bit... stiff.\u201d \u201cLexi, face it,\u201d says Byron, shaking his head. \u201cThe pantomime's over.\u201d \u201cNothing's over\u201d I say cuttingly. \u201cI'll just take this back to my office\u201d \u201cGive me a break!\u201d He sounds incredulous. \u201cI mean, for God's sake! Do you really think you're kidding\u201d \u201cHey!\u201d Amy's high-?pitched voice shoots across the office, drawing everyone's attention. \u201cLook! That's Jude Law! With no shirt on!\u201c \u201dJude Law?\u201c \u201dWhere is he?\u201d Byron's voice is drowned out under an instant stampede to the window. Debs is pushing Carolyn out of the way, and even Lucinda is craning to see.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I love my little sister. \u201cRight,\u201d I say in a businesslike way. \u201cWell, I must get on.

We should call OK! magazine!\u201d \u201cShe hasn't remembered a bloody thing!\u201d Byron is saying furiously, trying to make his voice heard. \u201cThis is all a bloody act!\u201d \u201cI need to go to my meeting with Simon. Get back to work.\u201c I swivel on my heel in my best scary-?Lexi manner and walk rapidly out of the office before he can reply. The door of Simon Johnson's office is closed as I arrive upstairs, and Natasha gestures to me to take a seat. I sink down onto the sofa, still a bit shaky from Byron's nearconfrontation. \u201dAre you both seeing Simon Johnson?\u201c she says in surprise, looking at Fi. \u201dNo. Fi's just here...\u201c I can't say, \u201dAs moral support.\u201c \u201dLexi needed to consult me on a sales document,\u201c Fi says smoothly, and raises her eyebrows at Natasha. \u201dShe really is back to her old self.\u201c \u201dUnderstood.\u201c Natasha raises her own eyebrows back. A moment later the phone rings and Natasha listens for a moment. \u201dAll right, Simon,\u201c she says at length. \u201dI'll tell her.\u201c She puts down the receiver and looks at me. \u201dLexi, Simon's in with Sir David and a few other directors.\u201c \u201dSir David Allbright?\u201c I echo apprehensively. Sir David Allbright is chairman of the board. He's the total bigwig, even bigger and wiggier than Simon. And he's really fierce, everyone says so. \u201dThat's right.\u201c Natasha nods. \u201dSimon says you should just go in, join the meeting and see all of them. In about five minutes, okay?\u201d Panic is sending little shooters through my chest. I wasn't counting on Sir David and the directors.</p><p>\u201cOf course! Fine. Um... Fi, I need to powder my nose. Let's just continue our discussion in the Ladies'.\u201d \u201cFine.\u201d Fi looks surprised. \u201cWhatever.\u201d I push my way into the empty Ladies' and sit down on a stool, breathing hard. \u201cI can't do this.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cI can't do it.\u201d I hug my folder helplessly. \u201cThis is a stupid plan. How am I going to impress Sir David Allbright? I've never given a presentation to important people like that. I'm no good at giving speeches\u201d \u201cYes, you are!\u201d retorts Fi. \u201cLexi, you've given speeches to the whole company. You were excellent.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d I stare at her blankly. \u201cI wouldn't lie,\u201d she says firmly. \u201cAt the last sales conference you were brilliant. You can do this standing on your head. You just have to believe it.\u201d I'm silent for a few seconds, trying to picture it, wanting to believe it. But it doesn't chime in my brain. It's not registered anywhere. She could be telling me I'm fabulous at the circus trapeze, or have a great triple axel. \u201cI don't know.\u201d I rub my face hopelessly, my energy dissipating. \u201cMaybe I'm just not cut out to be a boss. Maybe I should just give up\u201d \u201cNo! You're totally meant to be a boss!\u201d \u201cHow can you say that?\u201d My voice trembles. \u201cWhen I was promoted to director, I couldn't cope! I alienated all of you, I didn't manage the department well... I fucked it up. And they realize that.\u201d I jerk my head toward the door. \u201cThat's why they demoted me. I don't know why I'm even bothering.\u201d I sink my head into my hands. \u201cLexi, you didn't fuck it up.\u201d Fi speaks in a rush, almost brusque with embarrassment. \u201cYou were a good boss.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d I look up briefly and roll my eyes. \u201cRight.\u201d \u201cYou were,'\u201d Her cheeks have reddened. \u201cWe... weren't fair. Look, we were all pissed off at you, so we gave you a hard time.\u201c She hesitates, twisting a paper towel into a plait. \u201dYes, you were too impatient some of the time. But you did some really great things. You are good at motivat 357 ing people. Everyone felt alive and kicking. People wanted to impress you. They admired you.\u201c As I take in her words I can feel an underlying tension slowly slipping off me, like a blanket onto the floor. Except I can't quite trust what I'm hearing. \u201dBut you made me sound like such a bitch. All of you.\u201c Fi nods. \u201dYou were a bitch some of the time. But sometimes you needed to be.\u201c She hesitates, weaving the towel through her fingers. \u201dCarolyn was taking the piss with her expenses. She deserved a bit of a rocket. I didn't say that,\u201c she adds quickly, with a grin, and I can't help smiling back. The door to the Ladies' opens and a cleaner starts coming in with a mop. \u201dCould you give us two minutes?\u201c I say at once in my best crisp, don't-?argue-?with-?me voice. \u201dThanks.\u201c The door closes again. \u201dThing is, Lex...\u201c Fi abandons her mangled paper towel. \u201dWe were jealous.\u201c She looks at me frankly. \u201dJealous?\u201c \u201dOne minute you were Snaggletooth. Next thing, you've got this amazing hair and teeth and your own office, and you're in charge and telling us what to do.\u201c \u201dI know.\u201c I sigh. \u201dIt's... mad.\u201c \u201dIt's not mad.\u201c To my surprise. Fi comes over to where I'm sitting. She crouches down and takes both my shoulders in her hands. \u201dThey made a good decision, promoting you. You can be boss, Lexi. You can do this. A million times better than fucking Byron.\u201c She swivels her eyes derisively. I'm so touched by her belief in me, I can't quite speak for a moment. \u201dI just want to be...one of you,\u201c I say at last. \u201dWith everybody.\u201c 358 \u201dYou will be. You are. But someone has to be out there.\u201c Fi sits back on her heels. \u201dLexi, remember when we were at primary school? Remember the sack race on sports day?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon't remind me.\u201d I roll my eyes. \u201cI fucked that up too.

And if you'd kept going, if you hadn't waited for the rest of us... you would have won.\u201d She gazes almost fiercely at me, with the same green eyes I've known since I was six years old. \u201cJust keep going. Don't think about it, don't look back.\u201d</p><p>The door opens again and we both start. \u201cLexi?\u201d It's Natasha, her pale brow wrinkling as she sees me and Fi. \u201cI wondered where you'd got to! Are you ready?\u201d I give one final glance at Fi, then get to my feet and lift my chin high. \u201cYes. Ready.\u201d I can do this. I can. As I walk into Simon Johnson's room, my back is ramrod stiff and my smile rigid. \u201cLexi.\u201d Simon beams. \u201cGood to see you. Come and take a seat.\u201d Everyone else looks totally at ease. Four directors are clustered around a small table, in comfortable leather chairs. Cups of coffee are on the go. A thin, graying man whom I recognize as David Allbright is talking to the man on his left about a villa in Provence. \u201cSo, your memory is recovered!\u201d Simon hands me a cup of coffee. \u201cTremendous news, Lexi.\u201d \u201cYes. It's great!\u201d \u201cWe're just going through the implications of June '07.\u201d He nods at the papers spread over the table. \u201cThis is very good timing, because I know you had some strong views about the amalgamation of departments. You know everyone here?\u201c He pulls out a chair, but I don't sit down. \u201dActually...\u201c My hands are damp and I curl them around the folder. \u201dActually, I wanted to speak to you. All of you. About... something else.\u201c David AUbright looks up with a frown. \u201dWhat?\u201c \u201dFlooring.\u201c Simon winces. Someone else mutters, \u201dFor God's sake.\u201c \u201dLexi.\u201c Simon's voice is tight. \u201dWe've discussed this before. We've moved on. We're no longer dealing in Flooring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I've done a deal! That's what I want to talk about!\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cI've always felt the archive prints that Deller owns are one of its biggest assets. For several months I've been trying to find a way to harness these assets. Now I have a deal in place with a company that would like to use one of our old designs. It'll raise Deller's profile. It'll turn the department around!\u201d I can't help sounding exhilarated. \u201cI know I can motivate my department. This can be the beginning to something big and exciting! All we need is another chance. Just one more chance!\u201d I stop breathlessly and survey the faces. I can see it at once. I have made precisely no impact whatsoever. Sir David has the same impatient frown on his face.</p><p>Simon looks murderous. One guy is checking his BlackBerry. \u201cI thought the decision on Flooring had been made,\u201d Sir David AUbright says testily to Simon. \u201cWhy are we raising it again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt has been decided, Sir David,\u201d he says hurriedly. \u201cLexi, I don't know what you're doing\u201d \u201cI'm doing business!\u201d I retort with a clench of frustration. \u201cYoung lady,\u201d Sir David says. \u201cBusiness is forwardlooking. Deller is a new-?millennium, high-?tech company. We have to move with the times, not cling to the old.\u201d 360 \u201cI'm not clinging!\u201d I try not to yell. \u201cThe old Deller prints are fabulous. It's a crime not to use them.\u201d \u201cIs this to do with your husband?\u201d Simon says, as though he suddenly understands. \u201cLexi's husband is a property developer,\u201d he explains to the others, then turns back to me. \u201cLexi, with all due respect, you're not going to save your department by carpeting a couple of show flats.\u201d One of the men laughs and I feel a knife of fury. Carpeting a couple of show flats? Is that all they think I'm capable of? Once they hear what this deal is, they'll... they'll... I'm drawing myself up, ready to tell them; ready to blow them away. I can feel the bubbling of triumph, mixed with a bit of venom. Maybe Jon's right, maybe I am a bit of a cobra. \u201cIf you really want to know...\u201d I begin, eyes blazing.</p><p>And then all of a sudden I change my mind. I halt, midsentence, thinking furiously. I can feel myself retreating, fangs going back in. Biding my time.</p><p>\u201cSo... you've really made your decision?\u201d I say in a different, more resigned voice. \u201cWe made our decision a long time ago,\u201d says Simon. \u201cAs you well know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I sink as though in massive disappointment and chew at one of my nails. Then I perk up as though an idea's just hit me. \u201cWell, if you're not interested, maybe I could buy the copyright of the designs? So I can license them as a private venture.\u201d \u201cJesus Christ,\u201d mutters Sir David. \u201cLexi, please don't waste your time and money,\u201d says Simon. \u201cYou have a position here. You have prospects. There's no need for this kind of gesture.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want to,\u201d I say stubbornly. \u201cI really believe in Deller Carpets. But I need it soon, for my deal.\u201d I can see the directors exchanging glances. \u201cShe had a bump to the head in a car crash,\u201d Simon murmurs to the guy I don't recognize. \u201cShe hasn't been right since. You have to feel sorry for her, really.\u201d \u201cLet's just sort it out.\u201d Sir David Allbright waves an impatient hand. \u201cI agree.\u201d Simon heads to his desk, lifts his phone, and punches in a number. \u201cKen? Simon Johnson here. One of our employees will be coming to see you about the copyright of some old Deller Carpets design. We're closing down the department, as you know, but she's got some idea of licensing it.\u201d He listens for a moment. \u201cYes, I know. No, she's not a company, just a single operator. Work out a nominal fee and the paperwork, could you? Thanks, Ken.\u201d He puts the phone down, then scribbles a name and number on a piece of paper. \u201cKen Allison. Our company lawyer. Call him to make an appointment.\u201d \u201cThanks.\u201d I nod and pocket the paper. \u201cAnd Lexi.\u201d Simon pauses. \u201cI know we talked about a three-?month leave. But I think that by mutual agreement your employment here should be terminated.\u201c \u201dFine.\u201c I nod. \u201d I . . . understand. Good-?bye. And thanks.\u201c I turn on my heel and walk out. As I open the door I can hear Simon saying, \u201dIt's a terrific shame. That girl had such potential...\u201d</p><p>Somehow I get out of the room without skipping. Fi is waiting for me as I step out of the lift at the third floor, and raises her eyebrows. \u201cWell?\u201d 362 \u201cDidn't work,\u201d I murmur as we head to the main Flooring office. \u201cBut it's not all over.\u201d \u201cThere she is.\u201d Byron heads out of his office as I pass by. \u201cThe miracle recovery girl.\u201d \u201cShut up,\u201d I say over my shoulder. \u201cSo, are we really supposed to believe that you've recovered your memory?\u201d His sarcastic drawl follows me. \u201cYou're really going to snap back into it?\u201d I turn and regard him with a blank, perplexed gaze. \u201cWho's he?\u201d I say at last to Fi, who snorts with laughter. \u201cVery funny,\u201d snaps Byron, whose cheeks have colored. \u201cBut if you think\u201d \u201cOh, leave it out, Byron!\u201d I say wearily. \u201cYou can have my fucking job.\u201d I've arrived at the door to the main office, and clap my hands to get everyone's attention. \u201cHi,\u201d I say, as everyone looks up. \u201cI just wanted to let you know, I'm not cured. I haven't got my memory back, that was a lie. I tried to pull off a massive bluff, to try to save this department. But... I failed. I'm really sorry.\u201d As everyone watches, agog, I take a few steps into the office, looking around at the desks, the wall charts, the computers. They'll all be pulled down and disposed of. Sold, or chucked into skips. This whole little world will be over. \u201cI did everything I could, but...\u201d I exhale sharply. \u201cAnyway. The other news is, I've been fired. So Byron, over to you.\u201d I register the jolt of shock on Byron's face and can't help a half-?smile. \u201cAnd to all of you who hated me or thought I was a total hard-?as-?nails bitch...\u201d I swivel around, taking in all the silent faces. \u201cI'm sorry. I know I didn't get it right. But I did my best. Cheers, and good luck, everyone.\u201c I lift a hand. \u201dThanks, Lexi,\u201c says Melanie awkwardly. \u201dThanks for trying, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah... thanks,\u201d chimes in Clare, whose eyes have been like saucers through my speech. To my astonishment someone starts clapping. And suddenly the whole room is applauding. \u201cStop it.\u201d My eyes start stinging and I blink hard. \u201cYou idiots. I didn't do anything. I failed.\u201d I glance at Fi and she's clapping hardest of all. \u201cAnyway.\u201d I try to keep my composure. \u201cAs I say, I've been fired, so I'll be going to the pub immediately to get pissed.\u201d There's a laugh around the room. \u201cI know it's only eleven o'clock... but anyone care to join me?\u201d By three o'clock, my bar bill is over three hundred quid. Most of the Flooring employees have drifted back to the office, including a fractious Byron, who has been in and out of the pub, demanding that everyone return, for the last four hours. It was one of the best parties I've ever been to. When I produced my platinum AmEx, the pub people whacked up the music for us and provided hot nibbles, and Fi gave a speech. Amy did a karaoke version of \u201cWho Wants to Be a Millionaire,\u201d then got chucked out by the bar staff, who suddenly realized she was underage. (I told her to go back to the office and I'd see her there, but I think she's gone to TopShop.) And then two girls I barely know did a fantastic sketch of Simon Johnson and Sir David Allbright meeting on a blind date. Which apparently they did at Christmas, only of course I don't remember it. Everyone had a great time; in fact, the only one who didn't get totally pissed was me. I couldn't, because I have a meeting with Ken Allison at four-?thirty. \u201cSo.\u201d Fi lifts her drink. \u201cTo us.\u201d She clinks glasses with 364 me, Debs, and Carolyn. It's just the four of us sitting around a table now. Like the old days. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTo being unemployed,\u201d Debs says morosely, picking a bit of party popper out of her hair. \u201cNot that we blame you, Lexi,\u201d she adds hastily.

But you can't let on to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Carolyn is bright-?eyed. \u201cAre you pregnant?\u201d \u201cNo, you dope!\u201d I lower my voice. \u201cI've done a deal. That's what I was trying to tell Simon Johnson about. This company wants to use one of our old retro carpet designs. Like a special, high-?profile limited edition. They'll use the Deller name, we'll get huge PR... it'll be amazing! The details are all sorted out, I just need to finalize the contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat's great, Lexi,\u201d says Debs, looking uncertain. \u201cBut how can you do it now you're fired?\u201d \u201cThe directors are letting me license the old designs as an independent operator. For a song! They're so shortsighted.\u201d I pick up a samosathen put it down again, too excited to eat. \u201cI mean, this could be just the start! There's so much archive material. If it grows, we could expand, employ some more of the old team... turn ourselves into a company...\u201d \u201cI can't believe they weren't interested.\u201d Fi shakes her head incredulously. \u201cThey've totally written off carpet and flooring. All they care about is bloody home entertainment systems. But that's good! It means they're going to let me license all the designs for practically nothing. Then all the profits will come to me. And... whoever works with me.\u201d I look from face to face, waiting for the message to hit home.</p><p>\u201cVsf says Debs, her face suddenly glowing. \u201dYou want us to work with you?\u201c \u201dIf you're interested,\u201c I say a little awkwardly. \u201dI mean, think about it first, it's just an idea.\u201c \u201dI'm in,\u201c Fi says firmly. She opens a packet of chips and crunches a handful into her mouth. \u201dBut, Lexi, I still don't understand what happened up there. Didn't they get excited when you told them who the deal was with? Are they crazy?\"</p> <p>\u201cThey didn't even ask who it was with.\u201d I shrug. \u201cThey assumed it was one of Eric's projects. 'You're not going to save your department by carpeting a couple of show flats!'\u201d I imitate Simon Johnson's patronizing voice.</p><p>\u201cSo, who is it?\u201d asks Debs. \u201cWho's the company?\u201d I glance at Fiand can't help a tiny smile as I say, \u201cPorsche.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>So that's it. I am the official licenser of Deller Carpets designs. I had a meeting with the lawyer yesterday and another one this morning. Everything's signed and the bank draft has gone through. Tomorrow I meet with Jeremy Northpool again, and we sign the contract for the Porsche deal. As I arrive home I'm still powered up by adrenaline. I need to call all the girls, fill them in on developments. Then I need to think where we're going to base ourselves. We need an office, somewhere cheap and convenient. Maybe Balham. We could have fairy lights in the office, I think in sudden glee. Why not? It's our office. And a proper makeup mirror in the loos. And music playing while we work. There are voices coming from Eric's office as I walk into the flat. Eric must have arrived home from Manchester while I was with the lawyer. I peep around the open door to see a roomful of his senior staff grouped around the coffee table, with an empty cafetiere at the center. Clive is there, and the head of HR, Penny, and some guy called Steven whose role I've never been able to work out. \u201cHi!\u201d I smile at Eric. \u201cGood trip?\u201d \u201cExcellent.\u201d He nods, then gives a puzzled frown. \u201cShouldn't you be at work?\u201d \u201cI'll... explain that later.\u201d I look around the faces, feeling generous after my successful morning. \u201cCan I bring you all some more coffee?\u201d \u201cGianna will do it, darling,\u201d says Eric reprovingly. \u201cIt's okay! I'm not busy.\u201d</p><p>I head into the kitchen, humming as I make a fresh pot, sending quick texts to Fi, Carolyn, and Debs to let them know all went well. We'll have a meeting this evening, and talk everything through. I've already had an e-?mail from Carolyn this morning, saying how excited she is, and listing a load of new ideas and possible contacts for more exclusive deals. And Debs is gagging to take on PR.</p> <p>We're going to make a good team, I know we are. I head back to Eric's office with a full pot and discreetly start pouring it out while listening to the discussion. Penny is holding a list of personnel names, with figures scribbled in pencil at the side. \u201cI'm afraid I don't think Sally Hedge deserves a raise or a bonus,\u201d she's saying as I pour her a cup of coffee. \u201cShe's very average. Thanks, Lexi.\u201d \u201cI like Sally,\u201d I say. \u201cYou know her mum's been ill recently?\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d Penny makes a face as though to say \u201cSo what?\u201d \u201cLexi made friends with all the secretaries and junior staff when she came into the office.\u201d Eric gives a little laugh. \u201cShe's very good at that kind of thing.\u201d 368 \u201cIt's not a 'kind of thing'!\u201d I retort, a little rankled by his tone. \u201cI just got talking to her. She's really interesting. You know, she nearly made the British gymnastics squad for the Commonwealth games? She can do a front somersault on the beam.\u201d Everyone looks at me blankly for a second. \u201cAnyway.\u201d Penny turns back to her paper. \u201cWe're agreed, no bonus or raise this time, but perhaps a review after Christmas. Moving on, Damian Greenslade...\u201d I know this isn't my business. But I can't bear it. I can just imagine Sally waiting for the news of the bonuses. I can just imagine her thud of disappointment. \u201cExcuse me!\u201d I dump the coffeepot on a handy shelf and Penny stops talking in surprise. \u201cI'm sorry, can I just say something? The thing i s . . . a bonus may not be much to the company. It's peanuts to the bottom line. But it's huge to Sally Hedge. Do any of you remember what it was like to be young and poor and struggling?\u201c I look around at Eric's managers, all dressed in smart, grown-?up clothes with their smart, grown-?up accessories. \u201dBecause I do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLexi, we know you're a tenderhearted soul.\u201d Steven rolls his eyes. \u201cBut what are you sayingwe should all be poor?\u201d \u201cI'm not saying you have to be poor!\u201d I try to control my impatience. \u201cI'm saying you have to remember what it's like, being at the bottom of the ladder. It's a lifetime away for all of you.\u201d I sweep my hand around the room. \u201cBut that was me. And it feels like it was about six weeks ago. I was that girl. No money, hoping for a bonus, wondering if I'd ever get a break, standing in the pouring rain...\u201d Suddenly I realize I'm getting a bit carried away. \u201cAnyway, I can tell you that if you give it to her, she really will appreciate it.\u201d 369 There's a pause. I glance at Eric, and he has a fixed, livid smile on his face. \u201cRight.\u201d Penny raises her eyebrows. \u201cWell... we'll come back to Sally Hedge.\u201d She marks her paper. \u201cThanks. I didn't mean to interrupt. Carry on.\u201d I pick up the coffeepot and try to creep out of the room silently, only stumbling briefly on a Mulberry briefcase that someone's left on the floor. Maybe they'll give a bonus to Sally Hedge and maybe they won't. But at least I said my bit. I pick up the paper and am just flicking through to see if there's an \u201cOffices to Rent\u201d section, when Eric appears out of his office. \u201cOh hi,\u201d I say. \u201cHaving a break?\u201d \u201cLexi. A word.\u201d He walks me swiftly to my bedroom and closes the door, that horrible smile still on his face. \u201cPlease don't ever interfere with my business again.\u201d Oh God, I thought he seemed pissed off. \u201cEric, I'm sorry I interrupted the meeting,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cBut I was only expressing an opinion.\u201d \u201cI don't need any opinions.\u201d \u201cBut isn't it good to talk about things?\u201d I say in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cEven if we disagree? I mean, that's what keeps relationships alive! Talking!\u201d \u201cI don't agree.\u201d His words are coming out like bullet fire. He's still got that smile on, like a mask, as if he has to hide how angry he really is. And all of a sudden, it's like a filter falls off my eyes. I don't know this man. I don't love him. I don't know what I'm doing here.</p><p>\u201cEric, I'm sorry. I . . . won't do it again.\u201d I walk over to the window, trying to gather my thoughts. Then I turn around. \u201cCan I ask you a question, since we're talking? 370 What do you really, genuinely think? About us? Our marriage? Everything?\u201c \u201dI think we're making good progress.\u201c Eric nods, his mood instantly better, as though we've moved on to a new subject on the agenda. \u201dWe're becoming more intimate... you've started having flashbacks... you've learned everything from the marriage manual... I think it's all coming together. All good news.\u201c He sounds so businesslike. Like he might suddenly produce a PowerPoint presentation with a graph going up to show how happy we are. How can he think that, when he's not interested in what I think or any of my ideas or who I really am? \u201dEric, I'm sorry.\u201c I heave a deep sigh and slump down on a suede armless chair. \u201dBut I don't agree. I don't think we are becoming more intimate, not really. And...I have something to confess. I invented the flashback.\u201c Eric stares at me in shock. \u201dYou invented it? Why?\u201c Because it was that or the whipped cream mountain. \u201dI suppose I just... really wanted it to be true,\u201c I improvise vaguely. \u201dBut the truth is, I've remembered nothing this whole time. You're still just a guy I met a few weeks ago.\u201d Eric sits down heavily on the bed and we lapse into silence. I pick up a black-?and-?white photograph of us at our wedding. We're toasting each other and smiling, and outwardly blissful. But now I look more carefully, I can see the strain in my eyes.</p><p>I wonder how long I was happy for. I wonder when it hit me that I'd made a mistake. \u201cEric, let's face it, it's not working out.\u201d I sigh as I replace the picture. \u201cNot for either of us. I'm with a man I don't know. You're with a woman who remembers nothing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat doesn't matter. We're building a new marriage. Starting again!\u201d He's sweeping his hands around for emphasis. Any minute he's going to say we're enjoying \u201cmarriage-?style living.\u201d \u201cWe're not.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cAnd I can't do it anymore.\u201d \u201cYou can, darling.\u201d Eric switches instantly into \u201cconcerned husband of deranged invalid\u201d mode. \u201cMaybe you've been pushing yourself too hard. Take a rest.\u201d \u201cI don't need a rest! I need to be myself!\u201d I get to my feet, my frustration bubbling to the surface. \u201cEric, I'm not the girl you think you married. I don't know who I've been these last three years, but it hasn't been me. I like color. I like mess. I like...\u201d I flail my arms around. \u201cI like pasta! All this time, I wasn't hungry for success, I was hungry.\u201d Eric looks totally bemused. \u201cDarling,\u201d he says carefully. \u201cIf it means that much to you, we can buy some pasta. I'll tell Gianna to order some\u201d \u201cIt's not about the pasta!\u201d I cry out. \u201cEric, you don't understand. I've been acting for the last few weeks. And I can't do it anymore.\u201d I gesture at the massive screen. \u201cI'm not into all this high-?tech stuff. I don't feel relaxed. To be honest, I'd rather live in a house.\u201d \u201cA house?\u201d Eric looks as horrified as if I've said I want to live with a pack of wolves and have their babies. \u201cThis place is fantastic, Eric.\u201d I suddenly feel bad for slagging off his creation. \u201cIt's stunning and I really admire it. But it's not me. I'm just not made for... loft-?style living.\u201d Aargh. I can't believe it. I actually did the sweeping, parallel-?hands gesture. \u201cI'm... shocked, Lexi.\u201d Eric looks truly pole-?axed. \u201cI had no idea you felt that way.\u201d 372 \u201cBut the most important thing is, you don't love me.\u201d I meet his eye straight on. \u201cNot me.\u201d \u201cI do love you!\u201d Eric seems to regain his confidence. \u201cYou know I do. You're talented and you're beautiful...\u201d \u201cYou don't think I'm beautiful.\u201d \u201cYes, I do!\u201d He seems affronted. \u201cOf course I do!\u201d \u201cYou think my collagen job is beautiful,\u201d I correct him gently, shaking my head. \u201cAnd my tooth veneers and my hair dye.\u201d Eric is silenced. I can see him eyeing me up incredulously. I probably told him it was all natural. \u201cI think I should move out.\u201d I take a few steps away, focusing on the carpet. \u201cI'm sorry, but it's just... too much of a strain.\u201d \u201cI guess we rushed things,\u201d Eric says at last. \u201cMaybe a break would be a good idea. After a week or two you'll see things differently, and we can think again.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d I nod. \u201cMaybe.\u201d V It feels weird, packing up this room. This isn't my lifeit's another girl's life. I'm stuffing the absolute minimum into a Gucci suitcase that I found in a cupboardsome underwear, jeans, a few pairs of shoes. I don't feel I have any right to all the beige designer suits. Nor, to be honest, do I want them. As I'm finishing, I sense a presence in the room and look up to see Eric in the doorway. \u201cI have to go out,\u201d he says stiffly. \u201cWill you be all right?\u201d \u201cYes, I'll be fine.\u201d I nod. \u201cI'll take a cab to Fi's house. She's coming home early from work.\u201d I zip up the suitcase, wincing at its sound of finality. \u201cEric... thanks for having me. I know this has been hard for you too.\u201d \u201cI care for you deeply. You must know that.\u201d There's genuine pain in Eric's eyes, and I feel a stab of guilt. But you can't stay with people because of guilt. Or because they can drive a speedboat. I stand up, rubbing my stiff back, and survey the massive, immaculate room. The designer stateof- the-?art bed. The built-?in screen. The dressing-?room for all those millions of clothes. I'm sure I'll never live in such a luxurious place again in my life. I must be crazy. As my gaze sweeps over the bed, something crosses my mind. \u201cEric, do I squeak in my sleep?\u201d I ask casually. \u201cHave you ever noticed?\u201d \u201cYes, you do.\u201d He nods. \u201cWe went to a doctor about it. He suggested you douche your nasal passages with salt water before retiring, and prescribed a nose clip.\u201d He heads to a drawer, brings out a box, and produces a gross-?looking plastic contraption. \u201cDo you want to take it with you?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I manage after a pause. \u201cThanks anyway.\u201d Okay. I'm making the right decision. Eric puts the nose clip down. He hesitatesthen comes over and gives me an awkward hug. I feel like we're obeying instructions from the marriage manual: Separation (parting embrace). \u201cBye, Eric,\u201d I say against his expensive scented shirt. \u201cI'll see you.\u201d Ridiculously, I feel near tears. Not because of Eric... but because it's over. My whole, amazing, perfect dream life. At last, he pulls away. \u201cBye, Lexi.\u201d He strides out of the room and a moment later I know he's gone. An hour later, I really have, finished packing. In the end, I couldn't resist stuffing another suitcase full of La Perla and Chanel makeup and body products. And a third full of 374 coats. I mean, who else will want them? Not Eric. And I've kept my Louis Vuitton bag, for old times' sake. Saying good-?bye to Gianna was pretty hard. I gave her a huge good-?bye hug, and she muttered something in Italian while she patted my head. I think she kind of understood. And now it's just me. I drag my cases to the living room, then glance at my watch. There's still a few minutes till the taxi's due. I feel like I'm checking out of a posh boutiquestyle hotel. It's been a great place to stay, and the facilities were amazing. But it was never home. Even so, I can't help a massive pang as I step out onto the huge terrace for the very last time, shading my eyes against the afternoon sun. I can remember arriving here and thinking I'd landed in heaven. It seemed like a palace. Eric seemed like a Greek god. I can still conjure up that amazing, lottery winner's euphoria. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a sigh, I turn on my heel and head back inside. I guess I didn't have the perfect life handed to me on a plate, after all. Which probably means I was never Gandhi. As I'm locking the terrace door it occurs to me I should say good-?bye to my pet. I flick on the screen and click onto \u201cPet Corner.\u201d I summon up my kitten and watch it for a minute, patting a ball, cute and ageless forever. \u201cBye, Arthur,\u201d I say. I know it's not real, but I can't help feeling sorry for it, trapped in its virtual world. Maybe I should say good-?bye to Titan, too, just to be fair. I click on \u201cTitan\u201d and at once a six-?foot spider appears on the screen, rearing up at me like some kind of monster. \u201cJesus!\u201d In horror I recoil backward, and the next moment I hear a loud crash. I wheel around, still shakento see a mess of glass, earth, and greenery on the floor.</p><p>Oh great. Stunning work. I've knocked over one of those bloody posh-?plant things. Orchids, or whatever they are. As I'm staring at the wreckage in dismay, a message flashes up on the screen, bright blue on green, over and over. Disruption. Disruption. This place is really trying to tell me something. Maybe it is pretty intelligent, after all. \u201cI'm sorry!\u201d I say aloud to the screen. \u201cI know I've disrupted things, but I'm going! You won't have to put up with me anymore!\u201d I fetch a broom from the kitchen, sweep up all the mess, and dump it in the bin. Then I find a piece of paper and write Eric a note. Dear Eric, I broke the orchid. I'm sorry. Also, I ripped the sofa. Please send me an invoice. Yours, Lexi. The doorbell rings, just as I'm signing, and I prop the page up against the new glass leopard. \u201cHi,\u201d I say into the phone. \u201cCan you possibly come up to the top floor?\u201d</p><p>I might need some help with my cases. God knows what Fi will say; I told her I was only taking a shoebox full of essentials. I head to the outside landing and listen to the lift coming up to the penthouse floor. \u201cHello!\u201d I begin as the doors start opening. \u201cI'm sorry, I've got quite a lot of\u201d And then my heart stops dead. It's not the taxi driver standing in front of me. It's Jon. He's wearing off-?duty jeans and T-?shirt. His dark hair is 376 sticking up unevenly and his face looks all scrumpled as though he slept on it wrong. He's the opposite of Eric's immaculate, Armani-?model groomedness. \u201cHi,\u201d I say, my throat suddenly dry. \u201cWhat...\u201d His face is almost austere; his dark eyes as intense as ever. I'm suddenly reminded of the very first time I met him, down in the car park, when he kept studying me as if he couldn't believe I didn't remember him. Now I can understand why he looked so desperate when I told him about my marvelous husband Eric. I can understand . . . a lot of things. \u201cI called you at work,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they said you were at home.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d I manage a nod. \u201cSome stuff has happened at work.\u201d I'm all twisted up inside. I can't meet his eyes. I don't know why he's here. I take a step away, staring at the floor, winding my hands around each other tightly; holding my breath. \u201cI need to say something to you, Lexi.\u201d Jon takes a deep breath and every muscle in my body tightens in apprehension. \u201cI need... to apologize. I shouldn't have pestered you; it was unfair.\u201d I feel a jolt of shock. That's not what I was expecting. \u201cI've thought about it a lot,\u201d Jon continues rapidly. \u201cI realize this has been an impossible time for you. I haven't helped. And... you're right. You're right.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI'm not your lover. I'm a guy you just met.\u201d He sounds so matter-?of-?fact, there's a sudden lump in my throat.</p><p>\u201cJon, I didn't mean...\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d He lifts a hand, his voice gentler. \"It's okay.</p> <p>I know what you meant. This has been hard enough for you.\u201c He takes a step closer, his eyes searching for mine. \u201dAnd what I want to say i s . . . don't beat yourself up, Lexi. You're doing your best. That's all you can do.\u201c \u201dYeah.\u201c My voice is clotted with unshed tears. \u201dWell... I'm trying.\u201c Oh God, I'm going to cry. Jon seems to realize this, and moves away as though to give me space. \u201dHow'd it go at work with the deal?\u201c \u201dGood.\u201c I nod. \u201dGreat. I'm really pleased for you.\u201c He's nodding like this is the windup, like he's about to turn and leave. And he doesn't even know yet. \u201dI'm leaving Eric.\u201c I blurt it out like a release. \u201dI'm leaving right now. I've got my suitcases packed, the taxi's coming...\u201c I don't mean to look for Jon's reaction, but I can't help it. And I see it. The hope rushing into his face like sunshine. Then out again. \u201dI'm... glad,\u201c he says at last, carefully measured. \u201dYou probably need some time to think everything over. This is all still pretty new for you.\u201c \u201dUh-?huh. Jon...\u201c My voice is all thick. I don't even know what I want to say. \u201dDon't.\u201c He shakes his head, somehow managing a wry smile. \u201dWe just missed our time.\u201c \u201dIt's not fair.\u201c \u201dNo.\u201c Through the glass behind Jon, I suddenly see a black taxi turning into the entrance. Jon follows my gaze, and I see a sudden bleakness in the cast of his cheekbone. But as he turns back, he's smiling again. \u201dI'll help you down.\u201c 378 When the bags are all packed into the taxi and I've given the driver Fi's address, I stand opposite Jon, my chest tight, not knowing how to say good-?bye. \u201dSo.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo.\u201d He touches my hand briefly. \u201cLook after yourself.\u201d \u201cYou...\u201d I swallow. \u201cYou too.\u201d With slightly stumbling legs I get into the cab and pull the door to. But I can't yet bring myself to close it properly. I can't yet hear that horrible final clunk.</p><p>\u201cJon.\u201d I look up to where he's still standing. \u201cWere we... really good together?\u201d \u201cWe were good.\u201d His voice is so low and dry it's barely audible; his face full of mingled love and sadness as he nods. \u201cWe were really, really good.\u201d</p><p>And now tears are spilling down my cheeks; my stomach is wrenched with pain. I'm almost weakening. I could fling open the door; say I've changed my mind... But I can't. I can't just run straight from one guy I don't remember into the arms of another. \u201cI have to go,\u201d I whisper, turning my head away so I can't see him anymore; rubbing furiously at my eyes. \u201cI have to go. I have to go.\u201d I pull the heavy door shut. And slowly the taxi pulls away.</p><p>Chapter 21</p> <p>The world has finally gone mad. This is the proof. As I walk into Langridges and unwind my bright pink scarf, I have to rub my eyes. It's only October 16, and already tinsel is up everywhere. There's a Christmas tree covered in baubles, and a choir is standing on the mezzanine, belting out \u201cHark the Herald.\u201d</p><p>Soon they'll be starting the run-?up to Christmas on January 1. Or they'll start having an extra \u201cmidseason\u201d Christmas. Or it'll just be Christmas the whole time, even in the summer holidays. \u201cSpecial-?offer festive Calvin Klein pack?\u201d drones a bored-?looking girl in white, and I dodge her before I can get sprayed. Although, on second thought, Debs quite likes that perfume. Maybe I'll get it for her. \u201cYes, please,\u201d I say, and the girl nearly falls over in surprise. \u201cFestive gift wrap?\u201d She scurries around behind the counter before I can change my mind.</p><p>\u201cGift wrap, please,\u201d I say. \u201cBut not festive.\u201d 380 As she ties up the parcel, I survey myself in the mirror behind her. My hair's still long and glossy, though not quite as bright a shade as before. I'm wearing jeans and a green cardigan and my feet are comfortable in suede sneakers. My face is bare of makeup; my left hand is bare of a ring. I like what I see. I like my life. Maybe I don't have the dream existence anymore. Maybe I'm not a millionairess living in penthouse glory, overlooking London. But Balham's pretty cool. What's even cooler is, my office is on the floor above my flat, so I have the world's shortest commute. Which is maybe why I don't fit into the skinniest of my jeans anymore. That, and the three slices of toast I have for breakfast every morning. Three months on, the business has all worked out so well, sometimes I have to pinch myself. The Porsche contract is all happening and has already had interest from the media. We've done another deal supplying carpet to a restaurant chainand just today, Fi sold my favorite Deller designan orange circle printto a trendy spa. That's why I'm here, shopping. I reckon everyone in the team deserves a present. I pay for the perfume, take my bag, and walk on into the store. As I pass a rack of teetering high heels I'm reminded of Rosalie, and can't help smiling. As soon as she heard Eric and I were splitting up, Rosalie announced that she wasn't going to take sides and I was her closest friend and she was going to be my rock, my absolute rock. She's come to visit once. She was an hour late because she claimed her GPS didn't go south of the river, and then got traumatized by what she said was a street disturbance by 381 Yardie gangs. (Two kids messing with each other. They were eight.) Still, she's done better than Mum, who's managed to cancel each planned visit with some dog ailment or other. We still haven't talked since I went to see her that day, not properly. But Amy's kept me posted. Apparently, the day after I visited, without a word to anyone, Mum gathered up a whole load of her frilly clothes and sent them to Oxfam. Then she went to the hairdresser. Apparently she has a bob now, which really suits her, and she's bought some quite modern-?looking trousers. She also got a man in to sort the dry rotand paid him to take away Dad's paving slabs.</p><p>I know it doesn't sound very much. But in Mum's world, that's huge strides. And on the completely positive and fantastic front, Amy is doing spectacularly at school! Somehow she's wangled a place in Business Studies A-?level, alongside all the sixthformers, and her teacher is bowled over by her progress.</p><p>She's coming to intern with us in the Christmas holidays and I'm actually looking forward to it. As for Eric... I sigh whenever I think of him. He still thinks we're on a temporary separation, even though I've contacted his lawyer about a divorce. About a week after I moved out, he sent me a typed-?out document entitled Lexi and Eric: Separation Manual. He suggested we have what he called a \u201cmilestone meeting\u201d every month. But I haven't made a single one. I just... can't see Eric right now.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nor can I bring myself to look at his section entitled Separation Sex: Infidelity, Solo, Reconciliation, Other. Other? What on earth 382 No. Don't even think about it. The point is, there's no point dwelling on the past. There's no point brooding. It's like Fi said, you have to keep looking forward. I'm getting pretty good at that. Most of the time, it's as if the past is a whole other area, sealed off in my head, taped down at the edges.</p><p>I pause in the accessories department and buy a funky purple patent bag for Fi. Then I head upstairs and find a cool seventies-?style T-?shirt for Carolyn. \u201cFestive mulled wine?\u201d A guy in a Santa hat offers a tray full of tiny glasses, and I take one. As I wander on, I realize I've got slightly lost in the new layout of this floor, and seem to have strayed into menswear. But it doesn't matter; I'm in no hurry. I meander for a few moments, sipping the hot spiced wine, listening to the carols and watching the fairy lights twinkle...</p><p>Oh God, they've got me. I'm starting to feel Christmasy. Okay, this is bad. It's only October. I have to leave, before I start buying jumbo packs of mince pies and Bing Crosby CDs and wondering if The Wizard of Oz will be on. I'm just looking for somewhere to put my empty glass down, when a bright voice greets me. \u201cHello again!\u201d It's coming from a woman with a blond bob who's folding pastel-?colored sweaters in the men's Ralph Lauren department. \u201cEr... hello,\u201d I say uncertainly. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d \u201cOh no.\u201d She smiles. \u201cI just remember you from last year.\u201d \u201cLast year?\u201d \u201cYou were in here, buying a shirt for your... chap.\u201d She glances at my hand. \u201cFor Christmas. We had quite a long conversation as I gift-?wrapped it. I've always remembered it.\u201c I stare back at her, trying to imagine it. Me, here. Christmas shopping. The old Lexi, probably in a beige business suit, probably in a terrible rush; probably frowning with stress. \u201dI'm sorry,\u201c I say at length. \u201dI've got a terrible memory. What did I say?\u201c \u201dDon't worry!\u201c She laughs gaily. \u201dWhy should you remember? I just remembered it, because you were s o . . .\u201c She pauses, mid-?sweater-?fold. \u201dThis will seem silly, but you seemed so in love.\u201c \u201dRight.\u201c I nod. \u201dRight.\u201d I brush back a strand of hair, telling myself to smile and walk away. It's a tiny coincidence, that's all. No big deal. Come on, smile and go.</p><p>But as I'm standing there, with the fairy lights twinkling and the choir singing \u201cThe First Nowell,\u201d and a strange blond woman telling me what I did last Christmas, all sorts of buried feelings are emerging; thrusting their way up like steam. The sealing tape is peeling up at the corner; I can't keep the past in its place anymore.</p> <p>\u201cThis might seem like a n . . . an odd question.\u201d I rub my damp top lip. \u201cBut did I say what his name was?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d The woman eyes me curiously. \u201cYou just said he brought you alive. You hadn't been alive before. You were bubbling over with it, with the happiness of it.\u201d She puts the sweater down and eyes me with genuine curiosity. \u201cDon't you remember?'\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Something is clenching at my throat. It was Jon. Jon, who I've tried not to think about every single day since I walked away. 384 \u201cWhat did I buy him?\u201d \u201cIt was this shirt, as I recall.\u201d She hands me a pale green shirt, then turns away to another customer. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d I hold the shirt, trying to picture Jon in it; myself choosing it for him. Trying to conjure up the happiness. Maybe it's the wine; maybe it's just the end of a long day. But I can't seem to let go of this shirt. I can't put it down. \u201cCould I buy it, please?\u201d I say as soon as the woman's free. \u201cDon't bother wrapping it.\u201d I don't know what's wrong with me. As I walk out of Langridges and hail a taxi I've still got the green shirt, clasped to my face like a comfort blanket. My whole head is buzzing; the world is receding, like I'm getting the flu or something. A taxi draws up and I get in, on autopilot. \"Where to?M asks the driver, but I barely hear him. I can't stop thinking about Jon. My head's buzzing harder; I'm clutching the shirt... I'm humming. I don't know what my head is doing. I'm humming a tune I don't know. And all I know is it's Jon. This tune is Jon. It means Jon. It's a tune I know from him. I close my eyes desperately, chasing it, trying to flag it down And then, like a flash of light, it's in my head. It's a memory. I have a memory. Of him. Me. The two of us together. The smell of salt in the air, his chin scratchy, a gray sweater... and the tune. That's it. A fleeting moment, nothing else.</p><p>But I have it. I have it. \u201cLove, where to?\u201d The driver has turned around and opened the partition. I stare at him as though he's talking a foreign language. I can't let anything else into my mind; I have to keep hold of this memory, I have to cherish i t . .. \u201cFor Chrissake.\u201d He rolls his eyes. \u201cWhere-?do-?youwant- to-?go?\u201d There's only one place I can go. I have to go. \u201cTo... t o . . . Hammersmith.\u201d He turns around, puts the taxi in gear, and we roar off. As the taxi moves through London, I sit bolt upright, tensed up, clutching the straps. I feel as though my head contains a precious liquid and if it's jolted it'll be spilled. I can't think about it or I'll wear it out. I can't talk, or look out of the window, or let anything into my brain at all. I have to keep this memory intact. I have to tell him. As we arrive in Jon's road I thrust some money at the driver and get out, immediately realizing I should have called first. I whip out my mobile and dial his number. If he's not here I'll go to wherever he is. \u201cLexi?\u201d he answers the phone. \u201cI'm here,\u201d I gasp. \u201cI remembered.\u201d There's silence. The phone goes dead and I can hear swift footsteps inside. The next minute the front door swings open at the top of the steps and there he is, in a polo neck and jeans, old Converse sneakers on his feet. \u201cI remembered something,\u201d I blurt out before he can say anything. \u201cI remembered a tune. I don't know it, but I know I heard it with you, at the beach. We must have been there one time. Listen!\u201c I start humming the tune, avid with hope. \u201dDo you remember?\u201c \u201dLexi...\u201c He pushes his hands through his hair. \u201dWhat are you talking about? Why are you carrying a shirt?\u201c He focuses on it again. \u201dIs that mine?\u201c \u201dI heard it with you at the beach! I know I did.\u201c I know I'm babbling incoherently, but I can't help it. \u201dI can remember the salty air and your chin was scratchy and it went like this...\u201c I start humming again, but I know I'm getting more inaccurate, scrabbling for the right notes. At last I give up and stop expectantly. Jon's face is screwed up, perplexed. \u201dI don't remember,\u201c he says. \u201dYou don't remember?\u201c I stare at him in outraged disbelief. \u201dYou don't remember? Come on! Think back! It was cold, but we were warm somehow, and you hadn't shaved... you had a gray sweater o n . . .\u201c Suddenly his face changes. \u201dOh God. The time we went to Whitstable. Is that what you're remembering?\u201c \u201dI dunno!\u201c I say helplessly. \u201dMaybe.\u201c \u201dWe went to Whitstable for the day.\u201c He's nodding. \u201dTo the beach. It was fucking freezing, so we wrapped up and we had a radio with u s . . . hum the tune again?\u201c Okay, I should never have mentioned the tune. I'm such a crap singer. Mortified, I start humming it again. God knows what I'm singing now... \u201dWait. Is it that song that was everywhere? 'Bad Day.'\u201c He starts humming and it's like a dream coming to life. \u201dYes!\u201c I say eagerly. \u201dThat's it! That's the tune!\u201c There's a long pause, and Jon rubs his face, looking bemused. \u201dSo that's all you remember. A tune.\u201d When he says it like that it makes me feel utterly stupid for dashing across London. And all of a sudden, cold reality is crashing into my bubble. He's not interested anymore, he's moved on. He's probably got a girlfriend by now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u201cYes.\u201d I clear my throat, trying unsuccessfully to seem nonchalant. \"That's all.

I don't know what I was thinking \u201dIs it enough?\u201c Jon's voice takes me by surprise. I swivel, to see he's come halfway down the steps, his face taut with hope. And at the sight of him, all my pretense falls away. The last three months seem to fall away. It's just us again. \u201d I . . . I don't know,\u201c I manage at last. \u201dIs it?\u201c \u201dIt's your call. You said you needed a memory.

One tune.\u201c I make a sound that was supposed to be a laugh. \u201dIt's like... a cobweb. Gossamer-?thin.\u201c \u201dWell then, hold on to it.\u201c His dark eyes never leaving mine, he's coming down the rest of the steps, breaking into a run. \u201dHold on, Lexi. Don't let it snap.\u201c He reaches me and wraps me tightly in his arms. \u201dI won't,\u201c I whisper and grab him. I don't ever want to let him go again. Out of my arms. Out of my head. . When at last I resurface, three children are staring at me from the next-?door steps. \u201dOoh,\u201c says one. \u201dSex-?eee.\u201c I can't help laughing, even though my eyes are shiny with tears. \u201dYeah,\u201c I agree, nodding at Jon. \u201dSexy.\u201c 388 \u201dSexy.\u201c He nods back at me, his hands spanning my waist; his thumbs gently caressing my hip bones like they belong there. \u201dHey, Jon.\u201c I clap my hand over my mouth as though in sudden inspiration. \u201dGuess what? I suddenly remember something else.\u201c \u201dWhat?\u201c His face lights up. \u201dWhat do you remember?\u201c \u201dI remember going into your house... taking the phones off the hooks...and having the best sex of my life for twenty-?four hours solid,\u201c I say seriously. \u201dI even remember the exact date.\u201c \u201dReally?\u201c Jon smiles, but looks a bit puzzled. \u201dWhen?\u201c \u201dOctober 16, 2007. At about...\u201c I consult my watch. \u201dFour fifty-?seven p.m.\u201c \u201dAaah.\u201c Jon's face clicks in understanding. \u201dOf course. Yes, I remember that too. It was a pretty awesome time, wasn't it?\u201c He runs a finger down my back and I feel a delicious shiver of anticipation. \u201dOnly I think it was forty-?eight hours solid. Not twenty-?four.\u201c \u201dYou're right.\u201c I click my tongue in mock reproof. \u201dHow could I have forgotten?\u201c \u201dCome on.\u201c Jon leads me up the stairs, his hand firm in mine, to the cheers and jeers of the children. \u201dBy the way,\u201c I say as he kicks the door shut behind us. \u201dI haven't had good sex since 2004. Just so you know.\u201c Jon laughs. He peels off his polo neck in one movement and I feel a bolt of instant lust. My body remembers this, even if I don't. \u201dI'll accept that challenge.\u201c He comes over, takes my face in his two hands, and just surveys me for a moment, silent and purposeful until my insides are melting with want. \u201dSo remind me...what happened after the forty-?eight hours were over?\"</p><p>I can't hold out anymore. I have to pull his face down to me for a kiss. And this one I'll never forget; this one I'll keep forever. \u201cI'll tell you,\u201d I murmur at last, my mouth against Jon's hot, smooth skin. \u201cI'll tell you when I remember.\u201d </p>  </body></html>"]
