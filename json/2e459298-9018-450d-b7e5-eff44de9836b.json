According to the Gullah, it meant two things. One: darkness or dusk. Two: death, the life after, or beyond. I\u2019m familiar with both.</p><p>Death I\u2019ve known for a long time. I\u2019ve seen it firsthand, and it left a gruesome imprint in my mind that will haunt me forever. But like most crappy things that have happened in my life, I\u2019ve just dealt with it, and maybe death has made me stronger. One thing I\u2019ve learned is no matter how you face it, and no matter the situation, there\u2019s one constant present: finality. There\u2019s no getting around it.</p><p>My vision blurred as I watched the rain pelt the window of the corner booth where I sat at Molly McPherson\u2019s pub, and I blinked to see clearly through the evening shower outside. God, I wanted a smoke, but these days it made me want to puke, so I fished out a piece of nic gum from my bag and popped it into my mouth. October twenty-third, nine p.m., and it was rainy and warm\u2014nearly seventy-five degrees. Nothing was the same anymore, and although the changes were subtle to most, to me they were in-my-face obvious. I knew things others didn\u2019t, and to be perfectly honest, I\u2019m as glad as hell. I\u2019d much rather be totally prepared to face my fears and enemies head-on than be sucker punched because of ignorance\u2014no matter how innocent. And trust me\u2014I was ready. Beneath my short gauzy skirt, the weight of a pure silver blade rested against my bare thigh as a constant reminder.</p><p>\u201cHey, Riley, you want another pint?\u201d The shout crossed the small pub and caught my attention.</p><p>I lifted a hand at Martin, the bartender, and shook my head. \u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019m good.\u201d He winked and grinned and went about his business. Molly\u2019s wasn\u2019t too packed tonight, but the constant mumble of patrons was a low drone inside my head. If I stayed much longer, my temples would start to throb.</p> <p>With the palm of my hand I wiped the moisture from the window and scanned the busy, lamplit cobbled streets of Congress Street and City Market. I spotted him beneath the awning at Belford\u2019s. Jesus\u2014how long had he been standing there? Even though I couldn\u2019t see his cerulean blue eyes at such a distance, I knew that Eli had absolutely no trouble at all seeing me, and that his gaze locked solidly onto mine. An unstoppable, relentless thrill shot through my veins, and I shuddered. He stood there for a moment, watching me, and when he stepped into the throng of people out on the wet Friday night, he moved easily through the crowd toward me, effortless and commanding\u2014almost floating. His features were young, flawless, and ancient all at once. Dark brown hair swept tousled and sideways across his forehead, giving him an easygoing, sexy look. It stood stark against the palest, most beautiful skin.</p><p>As I watched him grow closer, his features became clearer, and I realized just how deceptive looks really could be. For instance, to most I probably looked like a total freak, with black hair and red-fuchsia highlights, tall leather boots, a fishnet tee, and pale skin with bloodred lips. And I\u2019m pretty positive the dragon tattoos\u2014visible beneath the fishnet\u2014that crept from my lower back up my spine and down both arms made people do a double take, as did the ebony angel wing inked into the skin at the corner of my left eye. I didn\u2019t mind\u2014although an angel I was not. I may not look it, but I\u2019m probably the most responsible person I know. Now, anyway. I\u2019ve a successful business, I pay my bills on time, and after I cleaned up my act I did a pretty good job raising my little brother. So while I was scrutinized, Eli blended right in, and it intrigued me to see him interact with people; they were clueless, oblivious to what was right beneath their noses despite the faultless, boyish, breathtaking good looks and charm. I wasn\u2019t. Not anymore.</p><p>The bad thing, and this I knew with complete clarity, was that I\u2019d die for him. And if such a thing were possible, he\u2019d die for me. Was that love? Obsession? Maybe it was both. But it was definitely something powerful, and I no longer had control over it. It was terrifying and exhilarating all at once. Talk about a high. It topped any drug I\u2019d ever done.</p><p>I scooted from the booth and stood, dropped a five-dollar bill on the table, and waved good-bye to Martin as I headed out into the now-constant drizzle. As the distance between us grew shorter, I could finally see the lamplight shine off his disturbing eyes as they searched mine, and my heart slammed against my ribs. I knew that there were much greater horrors, and sorrows, than death. Unimaginable things that just a few short months ago I would have vehemently disputed ever existed. Vampires. They\u2019re real. They exist. And they\u2019re so not what you think they are.</p><p>And I was utterly, irrevocably in love with one.</p><p>\u201cYou know, looking back now I can nail the</p> <p>exact moment everything around me changed.</p><p>What\u2019s funny is, I noticed it right away, but it</p><p>never really registered. I just didn\u2019t get it. Not</p><p>until later, after I realized vampires existed.</p><p>Know what it was? Cicadas. The moment it</p><p>happened, the cicadas silenced. I\u2019ve not heard</p><p>even one, much less the thousands that filled</p><p>every single summer night since I was a kid.</p> <p>They were my white noise, and they\u2019ve gone.</p><p>Fled. And it\u2019s annoyingly quiet around here.</p><p>How effed up is that?\u201d</p><p>\u2014Riley Poe</p><p>Part 1</p><p>DISTURBANCES</p><p>I am not afraid to die having thought of the issues of a dying hour.</p><p>\u2014Anonymous epitaph, Bonaventure Cemetery</p><p>Savannah, Georgia</p><p>Bonaventure Cemetery</p><p>August, after midnight</p><p>\u201cPoe, you wiener, get your ass over here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up! I ain\u2019t a wiener!\u201d</p><p>Broken, adolescent male laughter echoed through the night air, and if I hadn\u2019t been so damn mad, I\u2019d have laughed, too. Something about hearing a group of idiotic pubescent fifteen-year-old boys say wiener just cracked me up. But right then, I wanted to strangle all four of them\u2014especially the wiener. My younger brother, Seth. That little butthead knew I\u2019d check up on him\u2014especially when his plan included sleeping over at Riggs Parker\u2019s house. Yet there I was, after midnight on a Friday night, peering through the fence surrounding Bonaventure Cemetery. After I\u2019d worked all day. With the moon a waning crescent, shining through the canopy of trees, I could vaguely see their skinny little Levi\u2019s weave and dart through the aged headstones and shadows.</p><p>Sleepover at Riggs\u2019 house, my ass. They probably all told their parents they were sleeping over at each other\u2019s houses. Didn\u2019t they realize you can\u2019t con a con? Guess not, because here I stood in the middle of the freaking night, just to make sure my little brother kept out of trouble. I watched them edge toward the back of the cemetery, and I followed down the fence line toward one particular live oak, stepping over several gnarled roots\u2014not easy for those inexperienced in six-inch-heel boots. But I\u2019d managed that fine art during my partying days on the cobbles of River Street. I was a total pro. Finally, they got within earshot once again, and they were so busy shoving and calling each other perverted names that none of them even knew I was around. Good. I\u2019d sneak up on them, scare the crap out of them, then drag them all home before someone called the cops.</p><p>I gave my outfit a quick glance and then gauged the challenge before me. It just figured that the day I wore my leather miniskirt and spike-heel boots to the shop, I had to scale an eight-foot chain-link fence. If Riggs\u2019 mom had called a little earlier, I would have changed. But I\u2019d locked up and hurried out, and when I\u2019d caught sight of them on Victory, I never would have thought the goofballs would sneak into Bonaventure. It wasn\u2019t as easy to do as it\u2019d been when I was a teen. So there I was, skirt, spiked boots, and all. Good thing no one but the dead would see my hiniesca (high-nee-sca is a juvenile, made-up word for ass, and I use it frequently) when I shimmied over the top. I drew a deep breath and gripped the bars with both hands. Even in hot, muggy August, the dew-covered steel felt cool beneath my palms. I found the old notches in the oak\u2014the same ones my friends and I had used back in my wild days\u2014dug the toe of one boot into the gash, and stretched my other leg out until it hooked the top of the fence. I used to hate being so tall, but once again my five-foot-nine-inch frame came in handy. Using my stomach and arms, I braced myself and eased my other leg up and over, then slowly slid to the ground. My skirt caught on the damp steel and inched completely up around my waist, and my heels sunk into the mossy dirt as I landed. I swore silently, pulled my heels free, yanked my skirt back down, and crouched, listening. Those little pecker-heads would pay for this.</p><p>A crash followed by a string of swears cut through the still air and drifted to my ears. What in the hell were they up to? Easing through the damp moss and fallen oak leaves, I made my way to the far back corner of the cemetery, close to the river; I followed their voices silently. I probably knew every single headstone at Bonaventure\u2014my friends and I used to camp out here on a regular basis back in the day. Sick, I know, but true. Smoking joints while jumping headstones wasn\u2019t my proudest moment in life, but neither was having sex against one. For the record, I gave up joints and grave jumping a few years back. Sex I still had, just not against headstones. As I crept closer, I dodged and toed my way around pinecones and cockleburs, pushing aside the long hanks of Spanish moss that dangled from the branches. Finally, beneath the shadows and moonlight, the boys came into view, and I stared, dumbstruck, as Seth and his pals disappeared into an old crypt.</p><p>That explained the crash. Damn\u2014even I\u2019d never done that, and I\u2019d done a lot of crazy crap. But knowing what I knew from the Gullah? Hell and double no. I couldn\u2019t believe Seth was going along with it. The name on that particular crypt was ancient; the words were nearly sanded flat with the stone, the rest covered by sap, moss, and age. Couldn\u2019t read but maybe one or two letters at best. Preacher\u2014a well-respected Gullah elder, herbalist, and conjurer, as well as a practiced hoodooist\u2014had been a grandfather figure to me and Seth since Mom\u2019s death. He\u2019d called it da hell stone and told us a long time ago to stay away from it. When a Gullah conjurer warned you about something, you\u2019d better believe it was nasty-bad. If you had even a scrap of gray matter in your crane-cap, you\u2019d listen. They were descendants of the Africans brought to the eastern seaboard during the slave trade, and they knew some wicked-bad magic. Dark stuff. Some voodoo, some hoodoo, some traditional root medicine and herbal cures, some conjuring. All of it highly respected in the Gullah community. Jesus, Seth must have lost his friggin\u2019 mind. I listened for a few seconds; the deafening cacophony of cicadas nearly drowned out the boys\u2019 low chatter inside the old tomb. Damn, those bugs were loud. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With my backside pressed close to the aged stone, I slid sideways toward the crypt\u2019s new, ragged opening. Mosquitoes sank into my bare thighs, and I swatted at them without making contact with my skin. They kept right on biting.</p><p>I pushed through a final fall of moss and peered downward, my breath catching in my throat. The mausoleum looked more like an old stone shanty\u2014a slab about eight feet long and five feet wide, maybe four feet off the ground. From what Preacher said, though, the crypt itself was a helluva lot bigger belowground\u2014even here in the low country. They had kicked in the old rusted iron gate at the entrance and had lowered themselves inside. I couldn\u2019t see them, but I saw a light flickering and their shadows moving about. Great. They were probably waving around their lighters.They\u2019d catch the poor old dusty corpse on fire and themselves right along with it. Dumbasses. I wasn\u2019t a chicken or anything, but no way was I going down in there. This was da hell stone, and I wasn\u2019t taking any chances. I\u2019d just scare the hell out of them and watch their bony rumps scramble out of the crypt. Then I\u2019d yank Seth by the ears and drag them all home. Juvenile, I know. But it was the best I could do. If only I had some classic firecrackers, like Black Cats or Whistling Moon Travelers . . .</p><p>With a deep pull of air, I steadied myself and deepened my voice as much as I could. Not too hard, since it was naturally raspy and a little deep anyway. \u201cSavannah PD! Get your asses out of there now!\u201d</p> <p>Waiting for the scrambling of bony behinds was almost fun. I stood there listening to their cursing, calling of vile names, and climbing up stone with one hand over my mouth, the other hand viciously swatting at the mosquitoes sucking the blood out of my hide. Then, many things happened all at once.</p><p>Another crash sounded, almost like glass or pottery being broken, and a gust of wind seemed to whoosh from the crypt, high-pitched, almost like a howl. I turned my head to avoid the brunt of it because it smelled gross, like decay. Then one of the boys swore, and they all yelled with squeaky voices and piled out of the grave, flinging themselves onto the ground and then scurrying to get up. The wind abruptly stopped. The deafening chirping cicadas had grown completely silent. Bonaventure was as still as the death that lay buried beneath it.</p><p>Seth stumbled by, and I grabbed him by the shirt, pulling him to an abrupt stop. He whipped around, his eyes glazed; they turned angry when he recognized me. I let him go and lifted a brow.</p><p>\u201cGod, Riley!\u201d he hollered. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He frowned. \u201cLet me go!\u201d</p><p>The other boys stopped their scrambling and turned. They all fell to the ground, laughing. One whistled. Riggs, whom I\u2019d known since he was seven, said, \u201cPoe\u2019s sister is freakin\u2019 hot!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn, Poe\u2014where you been hidin\u2019 her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares, man?!\u201d Riggs said. \u201cHer ass is smokin\u2019!\u201d</p><p>They all laughed.</p><p>Seth\u2019s gaze left mine, and he lunged toward his friend. \u201cShut up, Riggs!\u201d</p><p>I smiled. A small piece of me felt proud that my little brother\u2014idiot that he was at the moment\u2014would want to defend me against his pervy friends. Maybe I hadn\u2019t done too bad a job in raising him after all. Again I grabbed Seth\u2019s shirt and yanked him backward\u2014not easy since the kid was already as tall as me with my boots on. \u201cLet it go, Bro,\u201d I said, and began tugging him toward the back of the cemetery. There was a place near the very back left fence where the ground sloped upward\u2014enough for us to climb out. I glanced at Seth\u2019s friends and inclined my head. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here before the cops show up for real. I\u2019m pretty sure you guys don\u2019t want your parents to get a knock on their doors tonight. It\u2019s a federal offense to desecrate a grave, you know.\u201d That was all we\u2019d need, especially since the cops already knew exactly who I was.</p> <p>\u201cDude, what\u2019s desecrate?\u201d one of the boys said.</p><p>\u201cYou want us to go with you?\u201d Riggs said, a smirk on his adolescent face. \u201cSo you can rat us out to our parents? No, thanks, babe!\u201d He turned to the others. \u201cCome on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, wait!\u201d I called, taking several steps and thinking that I\u2019d let Riggs find out on his own that his mom already knew about his little scheme. \u201cCome on, guys! I\u2019ll drive you home.\u201d I couldn\u2019t just leave them out in the middle of the night. No way. \u201cSwear to God, I won\u2019t rat you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks, sexy!\u201d Riggs hollered, laughing, and he and the others took off into the shadows. He called back, \u201cYou\u2019re fine as hell, but I ain\u2019t letting you hand me over to my mommy!\u201d More squeaky male laughter; then their voices grew faint as they slipped off into the night.</p><p>Somehow, that made me very uncomfortable, and yet as agile as I was, even in spike-heel boots, I knew I couldn\u2019t catch Riggs and his friends, corral them, and drag them all to my Jeep. I gave a sigh and shook my head. \u201cCome on, Bro. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>I looked at my brother. Even in the dimness of the oaks, I could make out Seth\u2019s venomous glare as he stared after his friends. He was truly pissed at them. \u201cWhatever,\u201d he mumbled. He kicked the dirt and threw a lanky arm over my shoulders. \u201cDidn\u2019t wanna come here anyway. Stupid idea.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him. \u201cWhy did you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cJust a lame bet.\u201d</p> <p>More adolescent male giggling cracked through the night as Riggs and the others blew us off and ran in the opposite direction. I had half a mind to call the cops. Maybe that was exactly what they needed: a little heat. But since Seth would be the one to catch hell, I let it go. I\u2019d circle Bonaventure to make sure they got out, and then I\u2019d follow their stupid little keisters home.</p><p>\u201cSchmucks,\u201d I muttered at them; then I turned back to Seth. I knew from experience not to pound him with why\u2019s and how come\u2019s\u2014it\u2019d been done to me plenty of times when I was his age, and it didn\u2019t do anything but royally piss me off. I\u2019d talk to him later. Besides, I could tell he regretted even hanging out with those guys, even though he\u2019d known Riggs since grade school. \u201cHey, wanna grab some Krystal\u2019s? I haven\u2019t eaten yet.\u201d I asked. Best fast-food burgers in the South, and they were open twenty-four seven. Nice and greasy.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d said Seth. \u201cHey.\u201d He stopped at the sloped ground and faced me. In the moonlight I could see the patches of whiskers he\u2019d tried shaving. His eyes, though, were completely sincere. I loved that about my brother. You could tell just about everything he was thinking and feeling in the depths of his eyes. \u201cSorry about tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cI know you gotta work in the morning.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a playful punch to the gut. \u201cYeah, well, not until eleven, so it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d I elbowed his ribs. \u201cYou can come in and sweep the floor for me.\u201d I grinned and dug my boot toe into a gnarled bump in the tree. \u201cYou\u2019d better turn your head unless you want an eyeful.\u201d No doubt my skirt was about to take a ride up my fanny again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have to ask me twice,\u201d he said, and turned his back.</p><p>As I crawled over the fence, I could hear Riggs and the others whistling. The sound wasn\u2019t that far away, and I knew they watched from close-by shadows. Freaking little perverts. A growl escaped Seth\u2019s throat, and I imagined that if Riggs had been close enough, Seth would have laid into him. My brother was lanky but as strong as hell.</p><p>As I landed on the soft ground and my heels sunk into the dirt, I noticed how deathly silent Bonaventure was. Not a single night bird, bug, or frog\u2014or Riggs and the guys\u2014made a single sound. The fine hairs on the back of my neck and arms rose, and I quickly brushed the uncomfortable feeling off.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Seth said as he dropped to the ground beside me. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost or something.\u201d</p><p>My gaze swept the graves, the luminescent marble statues that peeked through the trees, and the longer I stood there, the stronger the bad feeling became. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel that?\u201d</p><p>Seth was silent for a split second. \u201cYeah. What is it? It\u2019s creepin\u2019 me out.\u201d He scanned the cemetery. \u201cToo quiet.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him. \u201cYou know what crypt you were in, right?\u201d</p><p>He pushed his floppy bangs off of his face and nodded, his glassy-eyed stare reflecting the night. \u201cNot until after. I tried to talk Riggs into leaving it alone, but he\u2019s an idiot. He\u2019d kicked the gate in before I could stop him.\u201d</p><p>I wholeheartedly agreed. Riggs was an idiot. \u201cWell, let\u2019s get out of here, huh?\u201d I pointed. \u201cJeep\u2019s over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I drive?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>I grinned as we hurried across the sandy lot outside the cemetery and past the two pillars of the entrance. But the weird feeling stayed with me, grated at my insides, even after we pulled away. I eased down the one-lane street, waiting for a glimpse of Riggs and the guys as they stumbled from the cemetery, and the raw gut feelings that clawed at my insides disturbed me. I\u2019d spent too many teenage years looking over my shoulder in the shadiest streets of Savannah. I had to watch my own back, and gut feelings were things I paid attention to.</p><p>I felt as though someone watched us. And I didn\u2019t think it was Riggs and his friends, either. Weirdest damn feeling I\u2019d ever had. I never get spooked. When I was Seth\u2019s age, I was one badass punk kid. I didn\u2019t have a scared bone in my body, and I\u2019d do anything anyone dared me to do. I\u2019d even looked scary as a teenager, with my naturally pale skin and, back then, red hair streaked black, kohl-rimmed eyes, and black lips. I\u2019ve walked Savannah\u2019s cobbles the whole of my life, been in the darkest alleys, and I\u2019ve seen a lot of crap go down. I\u2019ve been in a lot of crap as it was going down. I was one effed-up kid back then, and if it weren\u2019t for Preacher, I still would be. But I\u2019d never had a feeling creep over me like this one. I wanted to continuously look over my shoulder, or worse\u2014overhead. What the hell would I be doing that for? What would be overhead? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The muggy brine from the marsh whipped at my face as I shifted into third, and I glanced at Seth. He was biting his nails and staring out what would have been his window, had the Jeep\u2019s top been on. I knew why he was acting funny. He\u2019d been inside da hell stone. I\u2019d be freaked-out, too, were I him. Dammit, he knew better than to go inside something like that. But I wouldn\u2019t torture him by asking a load of questions tonight. Tomorrow. I\u2019d wait until tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cThere they are,\u201d Seth said, pointing off to the left of the narrow street. Sure enough, there were those dingdongs, cutting across someone\u2019s yard. They disappeared around the back of a small, white, concrete house.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Todd\u2019s grandma\u2019s,\u201d Seth said. \u201cThey\u2019re staying there tonight.\u201d</p> <p>I downshifted into first and slowly drove by the old home. After I saw a light flicker on near the back of the house, I felt relieved. At least the boys were off the streets. We pulled away and headed into the now-thinned traffic of Victory Drive.</p><p>After going through the drive-through at Krystal\u2019s, we headed home. The smell of grease-soaked bread and fried burgers wafted from the paper bags, making my stomach growl. I was a proud JFJ (junk-food junkie), and I\u2019d bought a dozen. I\u2019d probably polish off at least five or six myself. If you\u2019ve never had a Krystal burger, they\u2019re glorious\u2014or hell on the stomach. Lucky for me, they worked perfectly fine for my digestive system, and I was starved. I turned onto Abercorn, hit all the squares, crossed Bay Street, and finally pulled onto the cobbles. The moment I turned onto the merchant\u2019s drive, the scent of urine from a busy Friday night stung my nostrils. That\u2019s something they don\u2019t put in the tourist mags of Savannah\u2014weekend public urination in the historic district. Nasty. Just freaking nasty.</p><p>I parked the Jeep at the back entrance of Inksomnia, pulled the emergency brake, and shifted it into first. I grabbed the drinks. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Bro, before I start gnawing on that paper bag. Hey, will you take Chaz out for a walk? He probably needs to pee.\u201d Chaz was our three-year-old Australian shepherd. Blue merle, one blue eye, one brown. Cool as hell, that dog, and we\u2019d gotten him from a rescue organization two years before.</p><p>Seth\u2019s eyes still looked hazed as he climbed out. \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p><p>It was then that I truly noticed the silence in the streets. Not human silence, as I still heard music pouring from the Boar\u2019s Head, laughter, and the occasional blast of a horn or the wail of a cop car in the distance. I even heard old Capote playing his saxophone on the river walk. But the cicadas? Crickets? Night birds?</p> <p>Dead silence.</p><p>I shoved the key in the lock and went inside, Seth on my heels, and immediately Chaz was there, barking and wagging his backside. \u201cHey, boy,\u201d I said, scrubbing the fur between his ears. \u201cYou miss us?\u201d Seth grabbed the leash hanging from the wall, snapped it onto Chaz\u2019s collar, and headed out with a waste bag. I watched him for a minute, until they disappeared up the walk. Before I closed the door, I glanced over my shoulder, out into the afterlight (the Gullah pronounced it afta-light).</p><p>I saw nothing; I felt everything.</p><p>Seth and Chaz came jogging up the cobbles, so I waited until they were inside; then I locked the door and threw the second bolt. Soon, though, I\u2019d find out that locks and bolts were for the ignorant. In reality, they were absolutely freaking worthless.</p><p>Part 2</p><p>THE BEGINNING</p> <p>When the alarm went off at eight the next morning, I was surprised to find I\u2019d actually had enough sleep despite the late-night escapade at Bonaventure. Although I didn\u2019t open shop until eleven, I loved the morning on the riverfront, and although I was completely unpredictable ninety-eight percent of the time, I was a total creature of habit for the last two percent: Gullah tea. I know\u2014to look at me you\u2019d never think for a second I enjoyed strong-steeped African tea with cream and sugar in the mornings. I looked more like a . . . Red Bull type of girl (I saved the Bull for midday). But Gullah tea was absolute heaven, and I drank it every single day. Slipping out of bed, I threw on a black tee and a pair of frayed jean shorts, pulled my hair into a ponytail, slipped into flip-flops, and eased downstairs. I took Chaz for a short walk, poured a heaping serving of dog food into his bowl, and eased out the back entrance of Inksomnia. I briefly glanced down as I left and made a mental note to paint my toenails later. The black-purple polish I\u2019d put on just two days before was already chipping off. I hated chipped polish. Total trash.</p><p>The thick, humid August air smacked me in the face and clung to my skin as I made my way down Factor\u2019s Walk to the back side of Preacher\u2019s store, which sat directly next to mine. Da Plat Eye. Literally, it meant the stink eye, or the evil eye, in Gullah, and was a wicked-cool herbs, potions, and magic store. Preacher and his wife, Estelle, belonged to a small but tight-knit community of Gullah who grew their own loose tea and other herbs out on what they simply referred to as Da Island\u2014one of the small barrier islands off the coast of Savannah. The tea was out of this freaking world. As I said, Preacher was an herbalist and conjurer, highly sought after for all sorts of cures for illnesses, hexes\u2014you name it. Although Preacher was the quiet, stoic type and was as gentle as a kitten, it took only one look of disappointment from him to make you want to curl up and bawl with regret (I know\u2014I\u2019ve done it). So I\u2019d decided to hold off on telling Preacher about Seth and da hell stone\u2014at least until I\u2019d gone over there during the daylight hours to check out how much damage had been done. Hopefully, nothing more than a gate and an old piece of pottery had been broken. As I pushed into Da Plat Eye\u2019s narrow double doors\u2014painted haint blue to keep the evil spirits out\u2014the ever-familiar bell tinkled above my head, and Estelle immediately emerged from behind the blue curtain that led into their living quarters upstairs. A big, warm, blindingly white smile stretched across her ebony face, and the brightly colored red, black, blue, and yellow scarf traditional to Gullah women that she wore wrapped around her head and knotted in the front matched the flowing skirt that reached her ankles. A haint blue Da Plat Eye T-shirt hung past her hips. She was probably all of five feet two inches high. My little Gullah granny.</p><p>\u201cAh! Dere\u2019s my Riley Poe,\u201d she said, and, as she did every morning, rushed over to hug me as if she hadn\u2019t seen me in forever. I admit that it felt good to have someone care so much. With a pair of strong, worn palms on either side of my face, she squished my cheeks, pulled my head down, and kissed me square on the nose. Dark, fathomless eyes stared up into mine, and she gave a mock frown. \u201cWhere\u2019s dat brodder of yours, huh?\u201d she asked in that unique Gullah accent that I never tired of hearing, even the more relaxed version they spoke around Seth and me. The cadence and pitch of that Creole blend of Elizabethan English and mesmerizing African drew the listener back in time. I loved it. \u201cDat lazybones boy still abed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I answered, and linked my arm through hers as we made our way to their kitchen. The aroma of fresh-brewed tea filled the two-hundred-year-old building, along with aged wood and fried bacon. My stomach growled so loud, Estelle turned and giggled.</p><p>\u201cYou poor tang; you don\u2019t eat enough,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cNow, git on in dere, girl. Your Preacher man is waitin\u2019 wit your tea. I\u2019ll bring da bacon and biscuits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet,\u201d I said. I gave Estelle a quick smile and hurried past stainless-steel pots, crockery, clay pots, and handwoven sweetgrass baskets hanging from the ceiling, and the newsprint-covered walls (newspaper print covering the walls keeps evil spirits at bay since they have to stop and read each word before taking action\u2014another cool Gullah belief) to the breakfast nook just off the kitchen. Preacher was in his usual straight-backed wooden chair, which was probably a hundred years old, near the corner window facing River Street. And no matter how warm the weather, he always\u2014always\u2014wore a plaid long-sleeved cotton shirt tucked into a pair of worn jeans. With a cap of short, pure white hair standing stark against his satiny black skin, he looked every bit the part of a Gullah root doctor. All-knowing brown eyes evaluated me as I walked toward him, and somehow, even after so many years, Preacher still had the ability to do something no one else could: make me squirm. I\u2019d never let it show, of course, and he knew it. It was a game between us, and one that wily old Gullah totally dug.</p><p>I met those ancient brown eyes with a stare of complete confidence, scrutiny, and an air of arrogance, and we continued our stare-off in silence until Estelle bustled into the nook.</p><p>\u201cAh, you two fools, stop wit da starin\u2019 dis mornin\u2019!\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cDon\u2019 you ever git tired of playin\u2019 dat game? Sit down, girl, before I take a switch to dat skinny backside. I already ate, so dig in.\u201d</p> <p>A small twitch in Preacher\u2019s lip made me laugh, and the game was over. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I said, and did as I was told. Estelle set a platter of thick fried bacon and biscuits on the table between me and Preacher, along with a bottle of cane syrup. A pot of tea sat steaming and ready.</p><p>Preacher grinned, a large white smile similar to his wife\u2019s. He stared at me a bit longer, then nodded at my plate. \u201cEat up so I don\u2019 have to listen to your stomach cry,\u201d he said with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have to ask me twice,\u201d I said, and dug in. We ate in silence for a few minutes, and after two biscuits drenched in cane syrup, and three slices of bacon, I pushed my plate aside and, dumping in a couple of spoonfuls of brown sugar and a splash of cream, started on my first cup of tea. The whole while, Preacher seemed to watch me with more depth than usual. Maybe that was guilt speaking for not telling him immediately about da hell stone. I brushed it off the best I could and sipped my tea. The pungent mix of odd and mysterious Gullah herbs at first stung my throat, as always, and then an irresistible smoothness settled in and warmed my insides. I glanced at Preacher over the rim of my cup, and he sipped his own brew\u2014straight black.</p><p>\u201cYou send dat brodder of yours over dis afternoon,\u201d he said, his voice deep and silky. \u201cHe can paper da walls upstairs for me, and I\u2019ll pay him. Can\u2019t give dem wudus idle eyes, and dat old paper up dere is fallin\u2019 down in places.\u201d He sighed and rubbed his neck. \u201cI been meanin\u2019 to replace it, but I\u2019m gettin\u2019 old, girl. Joints are achin\u2019.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I leaned back in the chair with my tea and frowned. Wudus was Gullah for evil spirits, something Preacher believed in wholeheartedly. I can\u2019t say that I totally bought it, but I wasn\u2019t completely opposed to the idea. I scrutinized him for several seconds. \u201cMy ass you\u2019re getting old. You look exactly like you did the first time I met you.\u201d I wiggled my brows. \u201cYou\u2019re hot, Preacher man. Seriously.\u201d</p><p>Estelle\u2019s high-pitched cackle rattled the pots hanging from the rafters. \u201cHa! Oh, girl, for shame!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a crazy painted white girl,\u201d Preacher said, his eyes smiling. \u201cI love ya like you was my own child, you know dat? Seth, too.\u201d He watched me closely, and I felt clear to my bones that he suspected something was up. Even if you didn\u2019t believe in Gullah ways, there was no getting around the power Preacher radiated. It was what saved me as a punk kid, dragged me from a total path of self-destruction.</p> <p>That was what the Gullah called me, because of my inked skin: painted. I\u2019d always loved it, and thought it fit me to a T. I drained my teacup, got up, and walked over to Preacher, who in fact did look a little tired today, and to be honest, that fact bothered the hell out of me. I wrapped my arms around his neck and hugged him tightly. \u201cYeah, I know, and we love you, too.\u201d I kissed his cheek, his unique, familiar scent of homemade soap and Old Spice wafting to my nostrils. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019d do without you and Estelle.\u201d I met his gaze. \u201cYou guys saved my life. Mine and Seth\u2019s.\u201d They knew it, too, and it wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d told them. For some reason, the need to assure them that I still felt that way overtook me, and they allowed it.</p><p>Preacher sat silently, as was his way, and we stared at each other for what seemed like a long, long time. He and Estelle and their extended community were the only family Seth and I had. Our father? I remember only vague glimpses of him, and I\u2019m as glad as hell. He left us right after I\u2019d turned ten, and Seth was a baby. I remember Mom crying for hours on end, days on end, and I\u2019d always hated him for that. Effing idiot. Last I heard, he was somewhere in the Louisiana prison system. I didn\u2019t care if I ever laid eyes on him again. Sometimes, though, Seth asked about him, and I figured he was at that age when his curiosity was getting at him. Every guy wants a dad\u2014even if that dad was a total fuckup.</p><p>Estelle bustled back into the nook and swatted me on the rump, breaking my hateful thoughts. \u201cYou\u2019d best git, girl,\u201d she said, gathering plates before I even had a chance to pick mine up. \u201cUnless you plan on paintin\u2019 folks in dem high shorts, dere.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, gave her a quick peck on the cheek, and smiled at Preacher. \u201cPeace out, Preacher man. I\u2019ll send Seth over in a little while.\u201d</p><p>Preacher gave a single nod, and I was already at the blue curtain before he said anything. \u201cWhen you feel like sayin\u2019 what it is you don\u2019t wanna say right now, come on back,\u201d he said. \u201cI got ears for you.\u201d</p> <p>I looked at him over my shoulder and stared in wonder. I knew he could tell something was up. \u201cHow do you do that?\u201d I asked. Seriously. I had one major poker face, and he still could tell I was keeping something from him. Damn.</p><p>Preacher merely lifted one plaid-covered shoulder. \u201cYou come back den. We\u2019ll talk right.\u201d</p><p>I met his gaze. \u201cI will.\u201d I scooted through the curtain and left Da Plat Eye fast. There was hardly anything worse than Preacher knowing something was up, and that he had endless patience waiting for you to spill the beans. Trust me when I say he reveled in knowing he made you squirm\u2014even if it didn\u2019t show on the outside. It made me feel guilty as hell for withholding info, but I needed to see exactly what the boys had done at da hell stone. It was a big deal, and I knew it would be to Preacher.</p><p>I made my way back to Inksomnia, stepped inside, and glanced at the Kit-Cat Clock (eBay, Classic Black, seventy-fifth-anniversary edition, $49.99 with free batteries and shipping!) on the wall: eight forty-five. I had time to run over to Bonaventure, check out the damage, and get back in time to shower and get ready to open shop. My first appointment was at eleven thirty, so no sweat. Grabbing my keys, I listened for a minute, heard nothing, so figured Seth was still crashed upstairs. \u201cChaz, come on, boy,\u201d I hollered, and Chaz came trotting down the steps, anxious to go for a ride. We hurried out the door and in minutes were on Bay Street, heading toward Abercorn. Chaz sat in the passenger seat, the wind blowing his ears back, as happy as a puppy. He was smart and completely obedient. Great dog.</p><p>Being that this was the first Saturday of the month, the historic district was already crowded with tourists and local shoppers on foot. The first Saturday included outdoor music, sidewalk shopping (the stores pulled merchandise out onto the sidewalk to sell), and food vendors along the river walk (I reminded myself right then to get a funnel cake later), and to top it off school would be starting up soon, so people would be grabbing their last little bit of vacation time. By noon there wouldn\u2019t be a single cobble visible, which was okay by me. There were always tourists who got a burr in their Levi\u2019s to get a spontaneous tattoo, and if I had an available spot, I\u2019d give them a one-of-a-kind piece of body art.</p><p>As I rounded LaFayette Square, I saw Capote knelt down by a park bench, pulling his sax from its case. I knocked the horn twice, Chaz let out a bark, and Capote glanced up, waved, and flashed a broad, white smile. He was Gullah, one of Preacher\u2019s cousins; he lived in a tiny apartment on Gaston Street. What a sweetheart that old guy was, and he could play the sax like a raving mofo. I\u2019d asked him once why he\u2019d never gone professional, and his simple answer was I don\u2019t need all dat fancy stuff, girl. He was a permanent Savannah fixture, Capote.</p> <p>The closer I got to Bonaventure, the heavier the marsh scent became, and with the top off my Jeep, it surrounded me; I inhaled a lungful. Some hated the smell of brine, but I liked it. It reminded me of my childhood, the innocent part, after we\u2019d gotten over my dad leaving, and before I\u2019d turned into a head-banging wild child. God, how I wished I could take all that crap back. I gave my mom hell, and she so hadn\u2019t deserved any more hell. The pain of that last moment with her, while she lay dead, lifeless in my arms, still haunted me, even in my sleep. I missed my mom so bad it hurt my chest to think about it, and yeah, I thought about it every damn day, even if I didn\u2019t want to. It just happened, invaded my gray matter and made me remember things I didn\u2019t necessarily want to remember. My penance, I suppose, since I was to blame for my mom\u2019s death. Probably why I\u2019d partied every last drop of craziness out of myself back then. I might look like I party hard now, but I\u2019m as domesticated as they come. An occasional drink at Molly McPherson\u2019s is all I\u2019m good for anymore. I left that wild life far behind, and only scars and remnants of my past were still visible and present. And all that by my ripe old age of twenty-five.</p><p>I pulled the Jeep into the left-hand-turn lane at the Victory Drive traffic light and threw it into neutral as I waited. The sun beamed down through the canopy of live oaks and Spanish moss with ferocity, making me squint through the tint of my shades\u2014and it was only nine a.m. I was neither a morning person nor a night person\u2014I dealt with both times of the day equally well. But as my lily-white skin revealed, I wasn\u2019t particularly fond of the sun. I burned fiercely. A thin sheen of part sweat, part humidity covered my exposed skin, and the slightest of breezes cooled me off. I watched patrons and traffic as I listened to the sounds of early-morning Savannah mixed with horn blasts, lost in my thoughts until a smooth voice from the car beside me interrupted.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe, nice dog. Really nice tats.\u201d</p><p>I stared straight ahead, uninterested. A low growl sounded deep in Chaz\u2019s throat, and though the double rejection probably pissed the guy off, he didn\u2019t show it. I could feel his eyes on me, though, and I hadn\u2019t even spared him a single glance yet. It was just a creepy feeling I\u2019d come to pick off rather fast, and ignore even faster.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t be shy, baby,\u201d he said, as if I had a shy bone in my body. \u201cYou want to meet later? Show me all your tats?\u201d He laughed. \u201cYou can leave your dog home.\u201d</p><p>My arrow turned green, and I threw the Jeep into first gear. I held the clutch for a second as I glanced over at the guy and peered at him over the rim of my shades. Figured. A smart-dressed older guy in a new Lexus, wanting to get it on with something he probably thought was freaky\u2014me. He probably had a wife and kids at home. He was so not on my agenda\u2014now or ever. For some reason, guys seemed to think alternatively dressed and inked skin equaled an easy lay. Funny thing was, I really wasn\u2019t anything, as in, I wasn\u2019t Goth, or any other sort of character. I just had a . . . quirky, artistic sense of style. I smirked, then shook my head in amusement, because to me he was a sick freaking idiot. \u201cYou wish, gramps,\u201d I said. Chaz barked, and I made the turn. I heard him call me a bitch, and for some reason it made me laugh. Even Chaz looked like he was smiling, with his tongue hanging out of his open mouth, the wind picking it up and flopping it all over. I\u2019d been called way worse; you can believe it. Sticks and stones, baby. It took a lot more than a little name-calling to hurt my feelings anymore.</p><p>Through the small community of Thunderbolt, I weaved my way down Bonaventure Road, to the front gates of the cemetery. Although they\u2019d been open since eight, the place looked totally deserted\u2014strange for an August morning. Usually, the tourists were wandering in and out of the keeper\u2019s building, meandering through the grounds, and checking out the famous monuments and infamously interred. I pulled in slowly past the keeper\u2019s redbrick building, following the path to the far right, and crept along in second gear to the rear of the property. Bonaventure was the epitome of the South, with towering, two-hundred-year-old live oak trees draped in wispy moss, and dozens of narrow dirt roads leading back into the white marbled statues and gray headstones of the graveyard. In the spring, pink, fuchsia, and white azaleas lined the dirt lanes, and vines of wisteria hung like grape clusters. Quite pretty, actually. A slight salty breeze always seemed to be passing through, rustling the leaves and anything else that got in its way. The cemetery itself overlooked the Wilmington River and salt marshes, and I guess if I had to die and be buried somewhere, Bonaventure would be an okay eternal resting place. As long as it was far away from da hell stone, thank you. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pulled the Jeep over, killed the engine, threw it into first gear, and set the emergency brake, then just sat for a moment as I took in the area. Something felt . . . funny. A slight breeze wafted through the leaves of the live oaks, and the faint rustling was the only sound in the cemetery. I scanned the rows of headstones, the white marbled statues and aged crypts, and realized it was way too quiet\u2014even for a graveyard. Not one cricket, bug, or bird made the slightest of sounds. It was totally silent, and it weirded me out. And I don\u2019t usually get weirded out. I glanced over at my dog, who had his nose lifted and was sniffing the air. He felt it, too. \u201cStay, Chaz,\u201d I commanded. He whined but firmly planted his backside in the seat. He wouldn\u2019t budge until I told him to.</p><p>I slid from the Jeep and started walking up the dirt path, my flip-flops slapping my heels, toward the back of the cemetery where da hell stone was located. The closer I got to the crypt, the stranger I felt, and an odd sensation crept over my skin. It tingled for absolutely no reason, and I was acutely aware of it as though hundreds of tiny ants crawled over me. More than once I glanced over my shoulder, and again\u2014up\u2014just like the night before. As if my feet had a mind of their own, my pace quickened. Funny thing was, so did my heartbeat, my breathing. It all accelerated.</p><p>Once da hell stone was in sight, I stepped off the dirt path and cut across the grass, the weird sensation growing stronger as I drew closer. Probably just my superstitions kicking in, but I was still jumpy, and I hurried even faster.</p> <p>I got close to the crypt and stared in disbelief. I slowly eased to the jagged opening, only it wasn\u2019t jagged at all. The rusted gate was in place, unbroken. It was as though nothing had been disturbed. Squatting down, I lightly ran my fingers over the aged steel; the edges where it fit perfectly against the crypt\u2019s opening even looked rusted into place. It was sealed tight. Untouched. Unbroken. What the hell? I continued to search the ground, the dirt, the stone, for any signs of what had happened the night before with Seth and his buddies. I didn\u2019t even see a Converse footprint. I even inspected some close-by crypts, and they all seemed to be in the same shape. Old, yet intact. No signs of vandalism anywhere. Nothing to indicate a group of teenage boys horsing around and stumbling out of a crypt.</p><p>Suddenly, I turned and jumped up at the same time, my hand flying to the back of my neck. It felt as though someone had breathed against my skin. I looked everywhere; no one was around. Far across the cemetery, I saw one of the workers pushing a wheelbarrow, but not a soul was close to me. Certainly not close enough to have blown on my neck. Not to sound like a baby or anything\u2014I\u2019ve been kickboxing for seven years and did plenty of street fighting before that\u2014but I was done with my inspection of da hell stone. People? They didn\u2019t scare me at all. I had handled the very worst of humanity, up close and way too personal. But spirits? Like I said earlier, I wasn\u2019t completely convinced they existed, but Preacher was one hundred percent sure about the wudus, and that fact alone made me nearly break into a run. I hurried back to the Jeep, where my dog was waiting patiently, jumped in, and drove off like some big damn scaredy-cat. As I pulled through Bonaventure\u2019s black pillared gates, I couldn\u2019t help but feel like someone watched me, and twice I threw a glance over my shoulder. Very, very weird.</p><p>I wondered whether I\u2019d been at the wrong crypt last night. I didn\u2019t think so; I grew up here. I knew Bonaventure like the back of my hand, and I damn well knew where da hell stone was. The groundskeeper could have fixed it, but that fast? The gate had been rusted into place. It didn\u2019t look repaired. It looked . . . ancient. And that was why I knew I definitely had to talk to Preacher. Something wasn\u2019t right, and I felt in my gut that only he\u2019d be able to figure out what. I\u2019d talk to him tonight, once I finished my last appointment. My thoughts continued to ramble as I made my way back to Factor\u2019s Walk, and by the time I walked through the back door of Inksomnia, I still didn\u2019t have an answer. It bugged the absolute hell out of me.</p><p>Throwing the keys on the counter, I hurried upstairs to shower, Chaz right on my heels. Nyx, my other artist and closest pal, would be here soon, and I was already running a little late. Before I hit the bathroom, I peeked into Seth\u2019s room, and the moment I pushed open the door, a wave of heat and brine hit me. The bedroom window was thrown wide-open, stuffy warmth pouring in. Seth was sprawled over his bed, shirtless and still wearing the jeans he\u2019d worn the night before. I walked over, closed the window, and shook his arm. A growl sounded from the doorway, and I turned to see Chaz standing there, the fur at his neck on end. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you, boy?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt\u2019s just lazy Seth. Go downstairs and wait on Nyx.\u201d He growled again, then turned and ran off. Totally strange, but I shook it off and turned back to my brother.</p><p>\u201cHey, butthead, I\u2019m not paying Georgia Power to cool off the riverfront. What\u2019s up with the open window?\u201d I asked. Seth\u2019s dark brown hair was slick with sweat, his skin all sticky. I smoothed his bangs from his eyes and shook him again. \u201cHey, Bro\u2014wake up.\u201d He continued to sleep, hard, and just when I thought he wouldn\u2019t answer, he did.</p> <p>\u201cA little more,\u201d Seth mumbled, and buried his face into his pillow. \u201cBeat.\u201d</p><p>I stared down at my sweet little brother, who\u2019d never given me a minute\u2019s trouble since Mom died, and couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cYeah, whatever, brat,\u201d I said, then leaned down and kissed the top of his head. Teenagers. I used to sleep like the dead myself. With a sigh, I left his room and jumped in the shower.</p><p>By the time I\u2019d pulled on my favorite red-and-black plaid miniskirt (equipped with a really cool steel-ringed belt that was slung low over my hips, and a pair of red lacy boy shorts to wear beneath), clunky ankle-high black boots, and a destroyed black tank that had Inksomnia\u2019s logo on the front in red, and tied my long hair in a high ponytail, I heard Nyx moving around downstairs, setting up shop. I fastened a black-corded choker with the cutest little black glass heart charm with a ruby in the center around my neck, hurried from the room, and jogged down the narrow steps. The moment I walked through the breezeway, Nyx turned and flashed me her infamous smile, enthusiastic and bright. Chaz was in his usual spot, on a large braided rug near the corner.</p><p>\u201cHey, Riley,\u201d she said, and set down a box of Skin Candy ink that must have arrived while I was in the shower. \u201cToday\u2019s going to be a superb day!\u201d She turned, marched over to the storefront window facing River Street, and yanked open the blinds. \u201cJust look at it out there. Sunshine perfectly teeming with lots of happy people who are dying to embark on their first tattoo!\u201d Turning, she glanced back at me expectantly, eyes innocently widened, hands on hips. \u201cDon\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>I grinned. There wasn\u2019t another soul in the world like Nyxinnia Foster. \u201cI bet you dinner at Garibaldi\u2019s we get at least one man or woman of the cloth in here today, claiming we\u2019re doing the devil\u2019s work.\u201d</p><p>Nyx studied me hard, her perfectly arched brows pulled completely together, bunched in the center. Her eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re on, Poe.\u201d</p> <p>If there was one thing in my life I could count on now, it was cheerful Nyx Foster always having a cup half full instead of half empty, and I truly loved that about her. We\u2019d gone to SCAD together (that\u2019s Savannah College of Art and Design) and had become fast friends the very first day of class. After I\u2019d established Inksomnia, she was the first artist I sought. Like me, she definitely had her own style, her own mentality and outlook on life, and it also leaned toward what people in general would classify as alternative, or Goth\u2014with a few Nyx twists. With straight auburn hair that she wore with bangs and\u2014nine times out of ten\u2014pigtails, porcelain skin that was nearly as white as mine, smoky eye makeup, and red lips, she definitely stood out in a crowd. To us, it was just an artistic expression of ourselves. Knowing today was the first Saturday of the month, and that River Street would be jam-packed by noon, she wore one of her favorite outfits (I thought she looked fantastic!): black shorts with suspenders, black-and-white ripped stockings that rose above her knees, a pair of black platform Mary Janes, and a red bowling shirt with black piping. On the back of the shirt was an embroidered spiderweb with a little spider in the center. It matched the one inked onto the back of her neck perfectly. Nyx was a sweetheart\u2014one of the most caring, giving people I knew, but the one thing we didn\u2019t have in common was background. While she was her own unique person and, like me, comfortable in her own skin, she\u2019d never lived on the street, never been in trouble, never seen the inside of a police station, and had a fantastic, supportive family. She\u2019d never even had a speeding ticket. I\u2019d spent my teenage years as high as a kite, smoked like a freight train, got into one too many fights, skipped school, and ran with the badasses. That crowd happened to be into heavy metal and Goth clubs. Don\u2019t get me wrong; just because someone\u2019s Goth or punk doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re dark, gloomy, or dangerous. I just happened to have hooked up with a bunch of losers who\u2019d fancied their own personal take on the Goth look. And I\u2019d run fast and hard, right along with them. Much to my regret, that is. Goth is not what you are. It\u2019s who you are. The general public makes that mistake all the time. And for the record, I\u2019m nothing like I was back then. Not the crazy, partying, careless teenager. I am scarred from it. Nothing I can\u2019t handle, though.</p><p>You see, that\u2019s what\u2019s funny about Savannah. The publicized, touristy part\u2014the Savannah you see in travel magazines? It\u2019s idyllic and all historically gorgeous. When people think of Savannah, they think of the Old South, horse-drawn carriages, moss, an original colony with scenic squares, tall church spires, and, strangely enough, Gothic Revival architecture. Maybe even Paula Deen and Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. The part of Savannah they don\u2019t see, and the part society is blind to? It\u2019s there, in the recesses of the shadows. Dark. Dangerous. Hidden, unless you\u2019re in. Hell, there are parts I\u2019m probably not even privy to\u2014especially now. And if you aren\u2019t careful, you can be sucked right into the pit of despair. There\u2019s always potential to fall into bad shit. I know. I\u2019ve been there. I fell and wallowed in it. And sometimes, when you\u2019re in, you stay in. Or you don\u2019t leave alive. I escaped, but not without repercussions. Big ones. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We finished setting up the shop and cranked up the music, and by then my appointment had arrived, along with four of his buddies, all military. Rather, about to be military, and we get a lot of those guys and gals. Hunter Army Airfield was right here in Savannah, and Fort Stewart was close by in Hinesville. My client this morning was a young guy, nineteen, and he and his buddies were all leaving for Parris Island\u2014the marines\u2019 boot camp\u2014in a week. They all sported buzz cuts and were pumped, big-time. God, they looked . . . too damn young. Just four years older than Seth. While the others browsed the art books and chatted with Nyx, my client, whose name was Zac, shyly walked up to me. Tall, a little lanky, but lean, with a pair of clear blue eyes, he flashed a hesitant smile. He was staring at my arms.</p><p>\u201cThat is some wicked cool artwork,\u201d he said. \u201cCan I see the rest of it?\u201d</p><p>I lifted one brow and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re not as shy as you look.\u201d</p> <p>Zac\u2019s face immediately turned as red as a ripe tomato. \u201cOh\u2014no disrespect, ma\u2019am. I\u2019d heard about it and honestly, I just wanted to\u2014\u201d</p><p>I laughed and shook my head. \u201cTake it easy there, Private. No need to get all flustered. I get that same question asked nearly every time my shop doors are opened. I\u2019m always prepared.\u201d I grinned. \u201cSwimsuit top underneath, so don\u2019t get too excited. Got it?\u201d</p><p>Zac laughed. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d His buddies were instantly at his side. Nyx stood behind them, a smirk on her face, swinging her hips in a little Nyx dance to the music. I wiggled my brows, and in one easy, practiced move I lifted my Inksomnia shirt over my head and turned around. Everybody always wanted to check out my dragons, and I admit\u2014they were pretty kick-ass. Inked in emerald green, with random ruby scales and lined in ebony, the art started at my lower back and twisted up my spine. The dragons on my arms started at my biceps and wound down to my wrists, the very tip of each tail wrapping around my index fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Zac said with appreciation in his voice. \u201cThat is sick. How long did it take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it hurt?\u201d one of his buddies asked.</p> <p>\u201cWho did it?\u201d another inquired.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d Zac said, turning even redder, \u201cis freaking hot.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and shook my head at the questions I\u2019d answered hundreds of times before, and just as I went to turn around, I saw this guy, standing at Inksomnia\u2019s large storefront picture window, staring in, and I froze. I felt my breath catch in my throat, and my heart slammed against my ribs. No more than three seconds passed, yet it seemed as though we\u2019d stood there for an hour. Although he wore a pair of dark shades, I felt as though he could see clear through me. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of him.</p><p>When I blinked, he was gone. Yeah, that fast. I thought to hurry over to the window, or even better, the door, and look for him, see which direction he went. But I didn\u2019t. I have no idea why. Something kept me planted right where I was.</p><p>Hastily, I pulled my shirt back over my head and turned to the guys and shrugged. \u201cEh, hurt a little, but not too bad. It took six sittings, at probably four hours each.\u201d I grinned. \u201cAnd the artist is standing behind you.\u201d</p><p>They all turned and stared appreciatively at Nyx, who gave a blas\u00e9 wave. \u201cIt was nothin\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d they all said at different times.</p><p>I looked at Zac. \u201cYou ready?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhatcha got for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said again, making me feel totally ancient. But those were the manners of the South, born and bred, and once baked into your brain, they always and forever remained. From his back pocket he pulled a folded piece of white sketch paper and opened it up. He handed it to me, and I inspected it thoroughly. It was a hand-drawn sketch of a Celtic-inspired tribal lizard.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cNice.\u201d It was, too. \u201cFantastic detailing. You draw this?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood work.\u201d Inclining my head, I met his gaze. \u201cLet me copy this and run a transfer off the computer, and then we\u2019ll be ready to ink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fire up the Widow!\u201d said Nyx with excitement, and hurried to my station to start the generator (called a Black Widow). I had Inksomnia set up completely in the spacious front room, almost like a beauty shop\u2014a sitting area with a sofa, two plush chairs, and a few ladder-backs. A square leather-topped coffee table with several albums filled with various art designs took up the corner of the storefront. Two inking stations were in the center, with a clear view from River Street so that passersby could look in and watch. The only thing hidden was the equipment room, situated in the back of the building near the steps that led up to my and Seth\u2019s apartment. Upstairs was our kitchen; down a small hall was our living room; then, farther down, were two bathrooms and two spacious bedrooms. It was a great setup, I thought, and had a perfect view over the Savannah River. Preacher had helped me get it a few years before.</p><p>About two hours and ten minutes later, I finished Zac\u2019s Celtic lizard, and he was totally thrilled with it. I admit\u2014it looked smokin\u2019 hot, inked over his right shoulder and shoulder blade, the head just peering over his collarbone. He and his buddies asked to take pictures with me, and of course I agreed. I was always baffled by how I was treated by most patrons as a celebrity; I was an artist who totally dug her job, nothing more. I didn\u2019t even have a reality show, yet you\u2019d have thought I did. Nyx said I was a legend in the tattooing industry; I merely loved my artwork. Zac promised to send me a copy of the photo, and they said good-bye. Somehow\u2014and I don\u2019t know whether it was because they were so young and full of life, or because I knew they\u2019d eventually be thrown in the center of battle, their innocence gone forever\u2014that good-bye felt sad. Typically, I wasn\u2019t the mushy sort, but I was definitely in mush mode today.</p> <p>It was almost five p.m. before I thought again about my brother.</p><p>The shop had been hopping since we opened, time had flown by, and I\u2019d just finished a wicked cat skull on a guy\u2019s rib cage, when the fact that Seth hadn\u2019t even come into the shop all day suddenly hit me. I hurried upstairs and into Seth\u2019s room; he hadn\u2019t budged. Fear grabbed me by the throat, and for a second I thought he was dead. Old memories left a lot of scar tissue, and the way I\u2019d found my mom? Emblazoned in my brain forever. I nearly tripped getting to the bed, and I grabbed Seth\u2019s hand. It was still warm, and in the back of my head, I\u2019d known it would be. I was just freaking out. \u201cSeth?\u201d I said, and shook him. No response. \u201cSeth!\u201d</p><p>I nearly stopped breathing as I waited for my baby brother to respond. I resisted the lack of air in my lungs, drew a huge breath, and followed it with a shout. \u201cSeth!\u201d</p><p>Part 3</p><p>CHANGES</p><p>Slowly, Seth\u2019s heavy lids lifted, and confusion glazed over his green eyes as he tried to focus on me.\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>A breath of relief escaped me, along with the feeling that I was behaving like an overreacting mom. With the back of my hand I felt my brother\u2019s cheeks, his forehead, and he just kept right on staring at me as though I\u2019d grown a swirling horn from the center of my head. I searched his face. \u201cDo you feel okay?\u201d</p><p>Seth tried to rise but fell back against the sheets. \u201cYeah. Fine. Just . . . tired.\u201d</p><p>I brushed the hair from his face. \u201cThanks to your fun run at Bonaventure, you\u2019re probably coming down with something.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure that was how you came down with anything, especially in the dog days of summer in the South, but Mom had always said it, and it sounded pretty good now. \u201cJust stay in bed for now and rest. Do you want anything to drink? Eat?\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s eyes were already closing again. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d He turned onto his stomach. \u201cYou\u2019re not sneakin\u2019 smokes, are ya?\u201d he mumbled into his pillow.</p><p>At that, I grinned. \u201cNo, Mommy. If you keep stressing me out, I just might. Now, get some sleep.\u201d Worrying about my baby brother was something foreign to me; he\u2019d never been sick, and as I\u2019d said before, he\u2019d never been in trouble. I suppose that made me a bit complacent. Now? I worried. And I didn\u2019t like it. Seth, on the other hand, worried about me constantly. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll check on you in a little while.\u201d I kissed the top of his head. \u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, too,\u201d Seth mumbled, and was fast asleep before I left the room.</p><p>Inksomnia stayed busy the rest of the day. I had appointments until seven p.m., and Nyx usually didn\u2019t make appointments on Saturdays at all\u2014she kept that day open for walk-ins, and they kept her Widow running hot all day long. The entire day, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about two things: my overly tired baby brother and that guy at the window. I don\u2019t know\u2014something about him struck me hard. All I could remember about the guy was a black T-shirt, dark brown hair that was kind of shaggy and swept to the side, and pale skin. He\u2019d been too far away to see detail\u2014except for a pair of perfect full lips. So why had he affected me so much? Secretly, I kept hoping he\u2019d show back up; I was positive he would, and I bet I glanced at the storefront a gazillion times. He didn\u2019t show, and it really wasn\u2019t a surprise after all; although he\u2019d certainly caught my attention, usually the guys who were attracted to me didn\u2019t exactly look like him. Let\u2019s face it. A guy had to be pretty confident and open-minded to be interested in a woman with a dragon tattooed up her back and both arms. Did I mention that I had a black angel wing inked at the corner of my left eye? That one was done in my angsty teen years\u2014my first tat\u2014and to be perfectly honest, I don\u2019t even remember getting it. I\u2019d been out partying, woke up the next afternoon, and bam\u2014there it was, the delicate skin around it as red as a beet, and in complete contrast to my character, as I was anything but an angel. I must have been pretty wasted not to feel it. Seriously pathetic. But I\u2019m stuck with it now, and I just go with the flow. Besides. If there was one thing I demanded in a guy, it was confidence. Fit that with open-minded, and that right there was probably the main reason I didn\u2019t have a boyfriend. Two difficult traits to come already combined. Not that I was actively looking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d Nyx asked. She peered at me over the back of an airman as she inked. She inclined her head toward the front window. \u201cDid I miss something exciting?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cHardly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p> <p>I grinned, shook my head again, and continued with my work.</p><p>Nyx checked on Seth twice, and I ran upstairs just before my last client arrived to check on him myself. He was still hard sleeping. That was a lot of effing sleep, but I chalked it up to . . . whatever. Teenager-itis maybe? I ran across the street, grabbed a couple of funnel cakes, and headed back inside. Nyx and I ate them while they were still hot, the powdered sugar turning to delicious gooey glue. Nothing better.</p><p>It was just after seven p.m., and Nyx and I were both busy inking clients when, finally, Seth wandered into the shop. The moment he came in, Chaz\u2019s head lifted from his paws and he growled. \u201cChaz, stop it!\u201d I commanded. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d He\u2019d never growled at Seth, or any of us, before.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with him?\u201d asked Seth, glaring at the dog. It looked like he\u2019d showered\u2014his hair was wet, and he didn\u2019t smell like he had earlier, thank God. But he still didn\u2019t seem himself, even after all that rest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I answered. \u201cMaybe he knows you\u2019re not feeling well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said, stepping close and inspecting my design. \u201cLooks good, Sis.\u201d</p><p>I wiped the specks of blood from my client\u2019s back with gauze, gave Seth a quick glance, then continued with the needle. \u201cThanks,\u201d I said, and concentrated on my work, the low hum of the Widow pulling me into the zone. \u201cPreacher wants you to help him put up some newsprint, if you\u2019re up to it.\u201d I finished the section I was working on, wiped, then let off the pedal. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell him about last night yet. You know he\u2019s gonna freak, so let me do it. I\u2019ll be over there once I finish up here. I\u2019m on my last client.\u201d</p><p>Seth just nodded, then pushed his long bangs out of his face. \u201cOkay. Yeah, I feel all right. I\u2019ll see ya.\u201d He pulled a pair of shades from his back pocket, slid them on his face, and walked up front. \u201cHey, Nyx,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHey, Little Bro,\u201d she replied. \u201cNice specs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Without a backward glance, Seth was out the door and headed up the sidewalk to Da Plat Eye. Nyx shot me a questioning look. It wasn\u2019t like Seth to blow through so fast. He adored Nyx and never let a day go by without hugging her or picking on her. He was such a lovable guy. Today he did neither.</p><p>\u201cHe must really feel like crap,\u201d Nyx said. \u201cPoor little man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I agreed, and continued with my work. By nine fifteen, I\u2019d finished my last client, and Nyx was working on a last-minute walk-in. I was cleaning up my station when Gene (named after Gene Simmons, of course) alerted us to another customer. Gene was a big, stuffed, inky black raven, perched right above the entrance, and when someone came in or out, it cawed\u2014loudly. Funniest damn thing I\u2019d ever seen. Nyx had given it to me when I\u2019d first opened Inksomnia. I looked over my shoulder in time to see a middle-aged woman with short hair, pressed khaki slacks, and a blue buttoned-up oxford step through the door. She smiled, laid a pamphlet on the coffee table, and hurried out. Nyx shot me a look, and I grinned as I walked to the front.</p><p>\u201cGreetings from Saint James,\u201d I read from the pamphlet. I looked at Nyx and lifted a brow. \u201cYou owe me dinner, sista.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat totally wasn\u2019t a woman of the cloth,\u201d Nyx said with a fake pout.</p><p>\u201cTotally a nun.\u201d I tucked the pamphlet in my drawer. \u201cThey don\u2019t wear habits anymore, goofball.\u201d I made for the front door. \u201cI\u2019m going to check on Seth. I\u2019ll be right back, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Nyx said, and I stepped outside for the second time that day. By now, the crowds from earlier were dwindling; a new crowd emerged, a different type of reveler. The night crowd. The ones responsible for the stinky urine and alcohol smell in the back alleys. Lots of interesting things happen after dark on River Street. I\u2019ve seen them firsthand. I was in quite a lot myself, back in the day.</p><p>As I walked to Da Plat Eye, I breathed in the heavy brine from the Savannah River, and a band played down the street. Funny\u2014I could pick Capote\u2019s unique sax out of the hundreds of people downtown, and his melody hung on the air as thick as the scent of pralines wafting downwind from River Street Sweets. Damn, those things were addictive. Pure sugar and cream. Just thinking about them made my stomach growl.</p><p>I stepped through the front door of Preacher\u2019s shop and took in the unique scent of herbs and unknown potions that never failed to intrigue me. The walls were lined with dark-stained oak shelves, and every space was filled with a jar or vial of something. Eye of newt? Sure. Graveyard dust? Absolutely. Dead man\u2019s nails? Got it. Shredded feathers? Yep. Jars and jars of unknown, wonderful concoctions were everywhere, including tins of tea. The handwoven sweetgrass baskets of all shapes and sizes that hung from pegs on the wall and the wooden rafters were absolutely gorgeous, as were the long strip quilts. The Gullah were renowned for preserving their heritage through language, as well as art, skills, and unique cooking. I had several baskets, quilts, and jars of spices that Estelle and her sisters had made and given me. Everything handmade by the Gullah, and one of a kind.</p><p>Estelle emerged from behind the curtain. \u201cOh, dahlin\u2019, your Preacher man had to leave. Your brodder is upstairs, doh, printin\u2019 da walls. Dat boy don\u2019t look so good. He sick?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I answered, and headed to the back. \u201cOr at least he\u2019s trying to come down with something. Probably just a cold. Where\u2019d Preacher go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got called to Da Island for somethin\u2019,\u201d she answered. \u201cWouldn\u2019t tell me what. Prob\u2019ly removin\u2019 some hex. Won\u2019t be back for a few days, dat crazy ole man.\u201d</p><p>I patted her arm as I passed by. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go upstairs and check on Seth. I\u2019ll be right back down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, dahlin\u2019,\u201d she answered. \u201cI just looked in on him a bit ago. He should be \u2019bout done.\u201d</p><p>I eased up the narrow wooden flight of steps, just like mine and Seth\u2019s, and for some reason, my stomach felt funny. You know\u2014the kind of funny where you feel something\u2019s not right? I hit the five-by-five landing and made my way down the hall. After looking in three rooms, I found him. Stepping inside, I noticed the fresh newsprint plastered to the wall, and Seth, curled up on the floor near the window. My heart jumped again, just like earlier, and I hurried over to him. Once more, I felt his hand, then his cheek, and noticed the slight rise and fall of his chest. Asleep. The little brat was asleep. Again. This time with his shades on.</p><p>\u201cSeth,\u201d I said, and tugged on his arm. \u201cCome on, Bro, wake up. I\u2019m taking you to the hospital and get you checked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m good,\u201d he mumbled, and shook off my hand. \u201cSincerely, Ri, I\u2019m good. I feel fine, just . . . tired. I don\u2019t need a doctor.\u201d He yawned. \u201cI just wanna go home.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cFine. Then, let\u2019s get you home. Estelle doesn\u2019t want you hanging out in here all night.\u201d I tugged again, and this time he allowed me to help him up. I looked at him. \u201cIf you don\u2019t kick whatever this is, and I mean soon, I\u2019m taking you to the Immediate Med. Got it? You\u2019re freaking me out, Bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, and leaned into me as we made our way to the stairs. \u201cJust so tired.\u201d</p><p>We eased slowly down the steps and stepped through the curtain. \u201cHave you eaten anything at all today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said groggily. \u201cNot hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough crap,\u201d I answered, and slid off his shades. He squinted and looked away. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have something,\u201d I insisted.</p><p>\u201cOh, dat is right, boy,\u201d Estelle said, and bustled over. \u201cI got somethin\u2019 for him,\u201d she said, and hurried to the kitchen, still talking. \u201cI said earlier, dat boy needed to rest. Asked him if he wanted a sandwich, but he said no. He always wantin\u2019 food, you know, so dat wasn\u2019t good.\u201d She emerged from behind the curtain holding a snap-lid container. \u201cYou give dat boy some of dis soup, Riley Poe. I jes made it dis mornin\u2019. Chicken.\u201d She cocked her head to the side and studied him. \u201cHe look awful pasty, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2014I\u2019m putting him straight to bed after I force some of this down his throat\u2014not that it needs forcing. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s great. Thanks, Estelle,\u201d I said, and accepted the soup as my Gullah granny frowned and shook her head. \u201cCall me if you need anything while Preacher\u2019s gone, okay?\u201d I gave her a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll see ya in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2019ll have your tea ready, girl,\u201d Estelle said. \u201cYou take care of dat boy, now.\u201d</p><p>We went through the back of Inksomnia, just in case Seth decided to barf all over the place. \u201cNyx, I\u2019m taking Seth upstairs\u2014be right back down,\u201d I called out.</p><p>\u201cNeed some help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope\u2014I\u2019ve got it. Thanks,\u201d I answered, and headed upstairs, my brother dragging his feet. Our kitchen is just at the top of the stairs, so we stopped there, and I poured some of Estelle\u2019s soup into a coffee cup, draining off the chunks of chicken and vegetables. I pushed the cup into Seth\u2019s hand. \u201cHere, lunkhead,\u201d I said. \u201cDrink up. At least some of it.\u201d</p><p>Seth made a face but drained the cup. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and set the mug on the counter. \u201cHappy?\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cHardly, but it\u2019ll do for now. I knew you were coming down with something. Just get to bed and rest. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just a summertime cold.\u201d</p><p>Seth turned out of the kitchen and started down the hall, then stopped, walked back, and surprised me with a tight hug. \u201cThanks for watching out for me, Ri,\u201d he said, his long, lean arms wrapped around me like a vise, and he pushed his face into my hair, close to my ear. \u201cLove ya.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damn, that kid knew how to absolutely melt my heart, and I hugged him fiercely back. \u201cI love you, too, Little Bro. If you need me during the night, come and get me, okay?\u201d</p><p>Seth was already walking down the hall, his back to me. \u201cSure,\u201d he answered, then disappeared into his room.</p><p>I watched for a minute longer before heading back downstairs to finish up with Nyx. In the back of my mind, though, I worried\u2014about Seth, about why Preacher had to leave in such a rush, especially before I had the chance to talk to him. Preacher was getting a little too old to be hauling ass anywhere, much less hopping a boat to Da Island. Anything could happen so far out in the sound, but he wouldn\u2019t listen.</p> <p>And of course, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn\u2019t get rid of the image of that one guy, staring at me through the storefront, and it irritated me that I dwelled on it. I mean, dozens of guys stare, and dozens come into the shop, and a dozen more hit on me\u2014a lot of them are pretty cute, too. So what was it about this guy? Was it because he didn\u2019t hit on me? The thought nearly made me laugh. Wasn\u2019t that a dude\u2019s way of thinking?</p><p>Surprisingly, the night went by uneventfully, and that was truly a miracle for a Saturday night. We had a pack of punks come in just before we closed, acting loud and obnoxious (and totally reminding me of me at that age), and one made a grave mistake. One of the boys walked up behind me and took me by surprise when he put his hand on my arm. Before he could say a word, I had his arm yanked behind him and jacked up high enough that he stood on the toes of his All Stars, yelping, \u201cHey!,\u201d his pubescent voice cracking. He was a big kid, too\u2014at least six feet tall. I jacked his arm higher up his back. \u201cOkay, okay!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Nyx said apologetically. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to ever do that.\u201d She smiled, her auburn pigtails swinging as she shook her head. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t like to be touched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys come back when you find your manners,\u201d I said, and gave the kid a little shove. He glared at me, and his friends laughed. I lifted a brow. \u201cAnd when those IDs are legit, big guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn, she\u2019s hot!\u201d one of them said as they all rushed from the store and headed up the sidewalk. I just shook my head and glanced at Nyx, who grinned. It being so late, I released her from her obligation of dinner at Garibaldi\u2019s\u2014for the time being, anyway. I didn\u2019t want to leave Seth home alone. Instead, I ordered from Chen\u2019s (orange chicken, vegetable lo mein noodles, and two shrimp egg rolls) and stayed in for the night. I worked out (I have a kickboxing bag hanging in my bedroom that I knock the hell out of daily) and took a long bath. Seth was still hard asleep when I took Chaz for a walk around eleven forty-five.</p> <p>I walked along Factor\u2019s Walk toward Emmet Park. No one was close by, although in the distance I saw people crossing Bay Street, and down on the riverfront I could hear laughter and music pouring from the bars. Lamplight burned a dim glow against the cobbles, making the shadows pitch long from the cannon and cross. The slightest of breezes wafted by, and it was at the same moment Chaz jerked to a stop and sniffed the air that the hair on my neck lifted. I turned fast around but found no one. \u201cCome on, boy,\u201d I told Chaz, and although he continued to sniff the ground, he\u2019d pause, too, and look cautiously around.</p><p>We\u2019d walked all the way to the end of Emmet Park and down the cobbled curve onto River Street, the Waving Girl Statue in view, when the feeling struck again. I jerked a look behind me, scanned the shadows, but noticed nothing unusual. A low growl emanated from Chaz\u2019s throat, and I tugged on his leash. \u201cLet\u2019s go, boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, don\u2019t go yet,\u201d a voice said from the recesses of the darkness. \u201cParty\u2019s just startin\u2019, babe.\u201d</p><p>Four guys emerged into the lamplight, and I immediately recognized two of them as the punks who\u2019d come into Inksomnia earlier. The one talking was the kid I\u2019d jacked up. Figures. I\u2019d bruised his pubescent pride, and now he wanted to get me back. Chaz growled. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d I said, and turned to walk away.</p><p>\u201cOh, man, you just got blowed,\u201d one said, and they all laughed. The kid I\u2019d jacked moved in front of me, and I stopped. The others, who seemed a little older, crowded around me, but just out of reach of Chaz, whose growling deepened. I tugged his leash. \u201cDown, boy.\u201d Great. Here we go. I hated having to kick juvenile ass, but I\u2019d do it if forced. And it looked like I was being forced. \u201cDon\u2019t make me give him the command,\u201d I said.</p><p>I lifted a brow. \u201cSic balls,\u201d I whispered. One of my most favorite movie quotes, from Stand by Me. Loved that freaking movie.</p> <p>\u201cI can change your mind, you know,\u201d the jacked kid said, ignoring my humor. Half his face was hooded in shadow, but the other half was all cocky smiles and teenage smugness.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d I said, barely able to keep from laughing.</p><p>\u201cBeing touched,\u201d he answered, and stepped toward me. He rubbed his hand over his burr-cut hair. \u201cYour friend said you didn\u2019t like it, but I think I can change your mind.\u201d</p><p>I dropped Chaz\u2019s leash and glanced at the half circle of guys. \u201cStay, Chaz,\u201d I commanded. \u201cSo let me get this straight. You\u2019re what? Gonna hold me down while your little friend here puts the moves on me? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on my turf now,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cNo one around but us, babe.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, stepped closer, and gave him a seductive stare. His eyes widened at what looked like anticipation. \u201cDid you really just say turf? Please.\u201d And just that fast I kneed his crotch. He yelled and bent over at the waist, and I brought my knee up hard and connected with his chin.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d he screamed, and dropped to the ground in agony.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t call me babe,\u201d I added, and glanced at the others. They all had blank stares on their faces as they looked at their friend on the ground.</p> <p>Something moved from the shadows\u2014so fast my eyes couldn\u2019t keep up. I stood frozen in place, no time to react. All three guys were lifted off their feet and flung in opposite directions, their muffled curses cracking the night air, followed by heavy thumps as they crumpled to the ground. I twisted and turned, searching in all directions. \u201cHey!\u201d I hollered. What the hell?</p><p>Then, from the corner of the building, a figure moved but did not emerge. From the tall, lean shape I could tell it was a guy. I moved closer.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said, and I stopped. His smooth and slightly accented voice crossed the darkness to my ears, firm, commanding. Groans from the fallen punks drifted on the night air. Chaz, who sat still, growled low in his throat.</p><p>My insides shook. Not out of fear, but out of adrenaline. What had I just seen? Rather, not seen? And why was he hiding? \u201cYou\u2019re pretty quick. Thanks\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you stupid?\u201d he asked, his tone steady, angry, as he interrupted me. \u201cWhy would you come out here so late? Alone?\u201d He swore under his breath.</p><p>I blinked in surprise. \u201cUh, my dog had to pee. Thanks for the help.\u201d I turned, grabbed Chaz\u2019s leash, and started back up the cobbled curve to head home. Who the hell was that guy? A citizen vigilante? He didn\u2019t have to know I needed no help at all, but damn. Why was he angry? Not all females were helpless. I shook my head and crossed the park, and I made it all the way to Inksomnia\u2019s back door before his voice jolted me. One second I\u2019m pushing the key into the lock and Chaz runs inside, and in the next second, he is standing directly beside me. My reflexes kicked in, and my fist flew up to his jaw, but he easily caught it in one hand. His grip was like steel, and I couldn\u2019t budge my arm. I lifted my knee, but before I could cram it into his crotch (in case you haven\u2019t noticed, a favorite move of mine), he had me completely pinned against the brick wall of my shop. With the streetlight shining behind him, his face was nothing more than a dark shadow. With one hand he closed the door. My heart thumped fast. This was not a situation I wanted to be in. I stared at his darkened face, waiting.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too careless,\u201d he warned. \u201cThose punks outnumbered you. They could\u2019ve hurt you.\u201d He drew his head closer, and I could barely see the outline of a strong jaw, shaggy hair. He looked . . . familiar. \u201cI could hurt you,\u201d he said, his voice deathly quiet.</p><p>I knew he could see every inch of my face\u2014I could feel his gaze searching every feature I had. The streetlamp\u2019s light poured directly onto me. I jutted out my jaw and narrowed my eyes. \u201cWell, either hurt me or get the fuck off me,\u201d I said, just as quiet. \u201cNow.\u201d One scream would have any of my neighbors running outside, but I waited. He seemed to weigh the situation as he stared at me. I felt threatened but not fearful. Weird.</p><p>It was several seconds before he released me from the wall. \u201cDon\u2019t be so reckless,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not as strong as you think.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t stupid. Even though I felt no fear, I didn\u2019t exactly want this guy forcing his way into my apartment, although I guess he could have done that earlier, had he wanted to. I kept my eyes trained on his shadowy face and eased my hand behind me, to the door handle. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d I gently turned the knob. A sound behind my Jeep made me jump\u2014a can rolling, something. I glanced, and when my gaze returned to my almost-attacker, I blinked. He was gone. Yeah, just that fast. I took a quick glimpse up and down merchant\u2019s drive, but he was nowhere. No-freaking-where. I didn\u2019t wait for a reappearance. I hurried inside and locked the door. As I got ready for bed and checked on Seth, who\u2014surprise\u2014was still sleeping, I tried to put the whole strange incident out of my head. Who was that guy? And why did he give a rat\u2019s ass if I was reckless or not? Finally, I drifted off.</p><p>Sometime later, a noise pulled me out of sleep, and I sat straight up in bed. My breath came fast, and I could actually feel my heart pound through my T-shirt. Chaz, on his bed in the corner, kept silent. The streetlamp shone straight into my room, against the aged white brick wall, and for a flash second I thought someone stood in the shadows, watching me. My heart nearly stopped, thinking my personal vigilante had returned. Then I thought better. \u201cSeth?\u201d I said, thinking he\u2019d come in and needed me. \u201cIs that you?\u201d I reached over and turned on the lamp. When I looked again, no one was there. The gauzy white curtains hanging at the balcony\u2019s French doors billowed out on a breeze. I didn\u2019t remember leaving the doors open. I listened for a few seconds, my groggy head trying to clear. I then realized the TV was on in the living room. Stumbling out of bed, I closed the French doors and followed the sounds to find Seth, sitting on the sofa, watching MTV. With his shades on. I stood in the archway, yawning. \u201cWhat\u2019s up? You feel better?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Seth answered without turning to face me. \u201cGuess I had enough sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I glanced around the room. \u201cDid you eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d he said. \u201cNot hungry.\u201d</p> <p>The room was all shadowy and dark, as you would expect at two in the morning, and the TV threw flickers of light against the wall. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with the shades?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLight\u2019s hurting my eyes.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, all lean muscles, lankiness, and shirtless in his worn, holey jeans, sprawled out on the sofa, and shook my head. \u201cAll right. There\u2019s more of Estelle\u2019s soup in the fridge if you get hungry, and some leftover Chen\u2019s. See ya in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he answered, and I couldn\u2019t tell if he had even looked my way once.</p><p>Sunday arrived like an ordinary Sunday. I turned on the TV and heard the morning news reporting that a woman\u2019s body was found in Daffin Park by a garbage street crew. No details were given regarding the cause of her death, but the reporter described the woman to be in her early forties, and apparently she had been robbed. I\u2019d assumed murdered. Police were on the case. For some reason, she remained on my mind for the rest of the morning. She, along with the mystery guy from the night before. I heard his voice over and over in my head, and for some strange reason, I liked it. Don\u2019t ask me why.</p> <p>Sunday was the only day of the week I closed Inksomnia, and I spent the rest of the morning with Estelle. Seth seemed to have his days and nights mixed up, and he spent the majority of the day sleeping. He never had a fever, so I didn\u2019t run him to the ER. But I watched him, and he just wasn\u2019t himself. Not sick, just not himself . Whenever he was awake, he had his shades on, and he was quiet, aloof, and . . . not Seth Poe at all. Usually my brother was a sweet, charming kid, with a great sense of humor. I know things change when puberty hits, but this was ridiculous. The change had happened overnight. Now, when he slept, he slept like the dead\u2014literally. I could barely rouse him. And Chaz\u2019s behavior toward Seth just didn\u2019t make sense. He growled every time Seth entered the same room. Chaz had never been anything but loving and faithful to all of us, especially Seth, and the dog usually slept on the foot of Seth\u2019s bed. It was just bizarre, and to be perfectly honest, it was starting to freak me out. I wished Preacher were here to check him over, but he wasn\u2019t due back from Da Island until Tuesday. Until then, I\u2019d nurse the peculiar feeling nagging the pit of my gut.</p><p>And for the record, I never again saw that guy from the storefront. Yeah, shamefully, I found myself looking for him, and yeah, it\u2019d only been one day. But he never stopped by again, and I admitted only to myself that I was disappointed. I think it stung a little, too. I had no idea why, but it did.</p><p>Sunday afternoon I asked Estelle to keep an eye out for Seth while I picked up a few things at the grocery store. I threw on a pair of button-fly jeans and a white Inksomnia tee. (Okay\u2014I self-promote. Can you blame me? Plus the logo is wicked cool.) I pulled on my black boots and headed out. Food Lion was packed, and I hurried through my list. The moment I left the store, I felt . . . watched. People pushed their grocery carts all around me, the parking lot was full, yet out of all the eyes surrounding me, I sensed only one pair honed in on me. With my shades covering my gaze, I looked around. I saw no one paying any particular attention to me. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if the vigilante watched from his car, or from another store.</p><p>When I got home, Seth was still asleep. I made sure he was okay\u2014still no fever, still breathing\u2014and wandered outside with Chaz to the riverfront. Capote was just a few yards up the walk playing, so I found a bench close by; he gave me a nod of acknowledgment, and I listened while I nibbled on a praline from the sweet shop. The walk was still crawling with people, so I ended up sharing the bench with an elderly couple, Chaz at my feet. With my peripheral I noticed them both sneaking peeks at me, and the smirk on Capote\u2019s face let me know he noticed, too. I guess my dragons entertained all age-groups.</p><p>I decided to walk along the riverfront for a while, just to stretch my legs and give Chaz a little exercise, so I threw a twenty in Capote\u2019s sax case. He tipped his hat, and I waved, and Chaz and I wandered off. There was a slight breeze blowing, the sun was starting to drop, and it seemed like a perfect August evening. The Savannah River Queen was just pulling in from a river tour, and the passengers lined the railing, waving. The Shrimp Factory\u2019s grill spilled the mouthwatering scent of seared spiced meat. Yet the whole time I walked, I felt as though someone watched me, followed me. I had a few quirks when it came to hoodoo beliefs (I do admit to carrying a small container of graveyard dust in my backpack that Preacher gave me, and a special vial of protection herbs), but people did not frighten me. I was strong and very capable, with a six-pack that made most guys jealous. . . . I again wondered whether the shadowy guy from the other night followed me. Once I even turned completely around and stopped, legs braced, hands on hips, and probably looking a whole lot like a freakish version of a Charlie\u2019s Angel, yet still\u2014I saw no one. Finally, as the sun sank, the crowds thinned, and I headed back home. I spent an hour ordering supplies online, sent a few e-mails, agreed to do an exhibit at an ink convention in California in November, and called it quits.</p><p>Nyx came over later and we hung out, sketching new designs and eating pizza. Seth stayed in his room until around eight thirty, when he wandered into the living room. Yes, with his shades on. Chaz growled, staring at my brother. \u201cBe quiet, Chaz,\u201d I commanded. I jumped up from where I was sitting cross-legged on the floor, sketch sheets spread out before me, and hurried over to where Seth plopped down on the sofa. I felt his cheek and forehead. Actually, instead of feeling warm, he felt a little cool.</p> <p>\u201cWow,\u201d Nyx said, her wide smile seemingly reaching each ear. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this motherly side of you, Poe. It\u2019s kinda sweet.\u201d</p><p>I shot Nyx a glare and turned to my brother. I moved to pull his shades off, and he jerked his head away. The abrupt shift wasn\u2019t anything like Seth\u2019s usual demeanor.</p><p>\u201cLay off, Riley,\u201d he snapped. \u201cJesus, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>This time, Chaz jumped to his feet, head lowered, and moved toward Seth, growling. \u201cBack,\u201d I snapped. Chaz froze in his tracks, and I returned my gaze to my brother.</p><p>No one, and I repeat, no one, had the power to hurt my feelings. Ever. I just didn\u2019t have that weakness in me anymore\u2014except with Seth, and maybe Preacher. And that small snub actually wounded me. \u201cYeah, well,\u201d I said, and moved away. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you, Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d he said just as sharply. He stood. \u201cAnd keep that freaking dog away from me.\u201d He left the room, and I could do nothing more than stare after him, shocked.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Nyx said gently. \u201cTake it easy on the kid, Riley. He\u2019s fifteen. Hormones, remember? Just leave him alone for a bit.\u201d She patted the floor. \u201cHere, have another slice of spinach and mushroom and finish this design. Looks wicked fab so far.\u201d She lifted a wide wedge from the box on the floor and took a big bite. Nyx\u2019s appetite was legendary, and hopefully it\u2019d keep her busy for a while, because I just couldn\u2019t let my brother walk off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d I said, and followed Seth. His door was cracked, so I gently pushed it open and stuck my head in. Seth stood by the window, his back to me as he stared out over River Street. \u201cCan we talk?\u201d I asked. When he didn\u2019t answer, I pushed. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Seth? Talk to me.\u201d Still, he kept his back to me, not answering, and I moved into the room to stand beside him. I could feel the air between us grow cold, and his posture stiffened, as though he couldn\u2019t stand me being close. It hurt like hell. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothin\u2019 to talk about,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cJust need space.\u201d</p><p>I moved closer. \u201cSeth, take your shades off and look at me.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, he simply stood, rigid, debating whether or not to do as I\u2019d asked, I supposed. Then, with a heavy sigh, he did, but he stared at the floor, at the wall, out the window\u2014anywhere but at me. For now, I accepted it.</p><p>\u201cLook\u2014I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going through right now, but . . . just hear me out, okay?\u201d I asked. \u201cI used to be your age, too, ya know, and not that long ago. Some things I do understand. I\u2019m here for you\u2014no matter what, okay? If there\u2019s something bothering you, tell me. Or if Riggs and the guys\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing bothering me, Riley,\u201d he said sharply, and this time, he did look at me, and his gaze was cold, angry, the green a shade or two lighter, and he slipped his shades back on and returned his stare to the window. An instant dismissal.</p><p>I stared at my brother\u2019s profile for several seconds\u2014noticed the tousled brown waves, his straight nose and firm jaw\u2014and suddenly, I couldn\u2019t see my baby brother anymore. I saw a young guy. An angry young guy. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said, and placed my hand on his shoulder. \u201cBut I\u2019m here anyway.\u201d I didn\u2019t linger or wait for a response, but simply left the room. Inside, my heart hurt\u2014literally ached\u2014from Seth\u2019s coldness, but I knew that to stay and try to pry stuff out of this new Seth wouldn\u2019t do any good, so I put my brother\u2019s behavior behind me for the night. It wasn\u2019t easy. I\u2019d gone from street punk to grown-up real fast, and I\u2019d been responsible for Seth since I was nineteen. I loved him more than life, and I now knew what my mom probably went through when I did the same thing to her.</p><p>When I walked back into the living room, I instantly saw Nyx\u2019s already pale face staring at the TV, a shocked expression pulling her mouth taut. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she muttered, and I glanced at the flat screen to see what it was. The local news was on, and the reporter, standing in front of the Cotton Exchange building, looked grave as he reported the brutal murder of a young marine recruit. A police car blazed blue lights nearby, and the rapid-fire flash recoiled off the black plastic bag covering the body strapped on the gurney. Then a picture of a handsome marine recruit flashed across the screen, along with a name: Zachary Murphy, age nineteen. \u201cZac,\u201d I muttered. My heart seized as I recognized the young guy who\u2019d come in for the Celtic lizard tattoo Saturday, and a wave of sadness swept over me. \u201cDamn, Nyx,\u201d I said, and glanced over at her. \u201cThat\u2019s two murders in one day. I wonder what happened to him.\u201d God, his poor parents. I knew exactly what they were going through. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Over the next few days, Seth\u2019s condition changed. I\u2019m not positive it worsened, just . . . evolved. What made matters worse was that Preacher had extended his trip to Da Island, so I didn\u2019t have his counsel to rely on. Seth\u2019s excessive sleeping eased up somewhat, but he wore his shades all the time, indoors and outdoors, sunshine or no sunshine. He barely spoke a word to me, or Nyx, and as soon as it was dusk, he was out, saying he wanted to hang out with his friends before school started. I\u2019d never let him just run the streets\u2014I knew where that could lead, and no way in hell was I about to let my brother screw up like I had. No freaking way. So when Riggs and the other boys showed up at Inksomnia at sundown, all wearing shades and looking like a band of thugs, I put my foot down. God, I sounded like an old stick-in-the-mud. But this was Seth, and I wasn\u2019t about to let him set even one size-eleven sneaker in the wrong direction if I could help it.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe, where\u2019s your brother?\u201d Riggs asked. He leaned a hip against my vacant inking table, arms crossed over his chest, trying way too hard to look cool.</p><p>Chaz rose from his rug, the hair along his back bristled, his head down, and the now-familiar low growl emanated from deep in his throat. This time, I let him. I turned to Riggs.</p> <p>\u201cBabe? Yeah, I don\u2019t think so, porcupine. Try again. And take off those stupid glasses,\u201d I said, totally irritated.</p><p>Riggs\u2019 expression turned . . . I don\u2019t know, hateful, and froze into place like stone. Slowly, he slid his shades off, and if the look on his face had seemed startling, the glare in his eyes was even worse. They seemed like ice, his eyes, without feeling, or anything, really. They even looked lighter than before. How could that be? Inwardly, I flinched, and that shocked me. The boy might be a teenage peckerhead now, but I\u2019d known Riggs Parker since he was a little guy, and until tonight I\u2019d known him to be harmless. Now? He studied me with the intensity of a predator, and that made me want to smack him on the back of the head.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Seth, Ms. Poe?\u201d His smile was as icy as his eyes. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here,\u201d my brother said behind me. \u201cReady?\u201d</p> <p>I continued to scrutinize Riggs. \u201cWhere are you guys going?\u201d</p><p>A small grin tipped the boy\u2019s mouth. \u201cMellow Mushroom. See?\u201d he pulled out a wad of balled-up bills. \u201cMy mommy gave me money.\u201d He slid his glasses back on and looked up at me. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, babe,\u201d he said sarcastically. \u201cWe\u2019ll be home early.\u201d</p><p>The others laughed\u2014including Seth\u2014and Chaz grew more agitated. He began to bark threateningly. \u201cChaz, back,\u201d I said, and my gaze snapped to Seth as I swallowed the hurt. \u201cBy eleven, Bro. Don\u2019t make me come looking for you. I\u2019m dead serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d he mumbled, which again irritated me because we all know what whatever really meant. Eff you. The boys left the shop. Outside, Riggs glanced back at me through the storefront and smiled, and swear to God, it gave me chills. Chaz noticed and lunged at the window, barking like crazy. I knew the feeling. I wanted right then to go knock the hell out of him, and if he\u2019d been of legal age, I would have.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with Chaz lately?\u201d Nyx asked, rubbing the fur between his ears, talking soothingly to him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Riley,\u201d she said comfortingly. \u201cHe\u2019ll be all right.\u201d She grinned. \u201cHe\u2019s just trying to show off in front of his friends. I\u2019ll bet you were the exact same way at fifteen.\u201d</p><p>I continued to stare out of the storefront. \u201cWay, way worse, Nyxinnia. That\u2019s what worries me.\u201d And that was exactly what I did for the rest of the evening\u2014worried. I beat the hell out of the bag that night, hoping to work out some of the tension, and by the time I\u2019d worn myself out, my knuckles, feet, and shins hurt like hell. I was in the kitchen sucking down a bottle of water when Seth came trudging up the stairs, right at eleven on the nose. He didn\u2019t even acknowledge me and instead went straight to his room and shut the door. I almost followed. But Nyx\u2019s words rang in my head, so I cut him some slack\u2014especially since he\u2019d made it home on time\u2014and decided to talk to him in the morning. Obviously, something was bothering him, and I hated that he didn\u2019t trust me to help him.</p> <p>I showered and got ready for bed, but sleep evaded me. Instead of tossing restlessly, I wandered out onto the small balcony outside my bedroom. There was just enough room to stand, with a black, wrought-iron railing to keep me from tumbling over. I stood there and stared out into the night, watching the sliver of moon glimmer over the river. The night was still, and I felt vulnerable, not a feeling I particularly liked. My thoughts turned to Zac, a guy I didn\u2019t even know, and how he\u2019d been so young and had died so young. What had happened? I couldn\u2019t help but wonder who\u2019d done it, and think about how the killer right now walked the very streets my brother and I lived on. I mean, the Cotton Exchange building was two seconds from Inksomnia. I could see it from my back door.</p><p>I turned to leave, but before I stepped back inside, that gnawing feeling came over me once more\u2014the one that made me look over my shoulder. I stared out into the night, into the afterlight, searching the darkness. I felt with all certainty that a pair of eyes watched me from the shadows. Swear to God, I couldn\u2019t take much more. It was happening all too frequently, and frankly, it was pissing me off. Especially if it was that tough guy from the other night. I closed and locked the balcony door. I did not sleep well after.</p><p>Sometime later, I jerked wide-awake with a gasp and sat straight up. At the same time, I heard Chaz\u2019s lowthroated growl. My blurred vision, groggy from sleep, scanned the dark corners of my room, straining to see. My insides froze. Someone was in my room. I slipped my hand slowly toward the back left bedpost, where I kept a baseball bat. My fingers gripped the handle. I slid my feet slowly to the floor and lifted the bat over my shoulder. A car ambled down the cobbles on the street below, and the headlights cast an illuminated arc across my bedroom wall\u2014and my brother. Again, I gasped, taken off guard. \u201cSeth? What are you doing?\u201d I lowered the bat.</p><p>Seth didn\u2019t speak or move; he stood completely still. I couldn\u2019t see his expression now, but I had for a fleeting second as the car had passed. He\u2019d looked . . . vacant, angry. I won\u2019t lie\u2014it scared the hell out of me. What scared me even more was that I hadn\u2019t loosened my grip on the bat.</p><p>\u201cSeth?\u201d I said, not too loud, but definitely assertive. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Bro? Are you sick?\u201d</p><p>Chaz now stood and had taken a few steps toward my bed. His growling grew louder. Seth remained silent.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, and eased toward him. \u201cWant me to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Seth finally said. His voice sounded . . . different. Strained. Deeper.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d I said, forcing myself to remain calm. \u201cI\u2019m going to turn on the light\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Seth yelled, and lunged at me. Chaz lunged at Seth, knocked him down, and latched onto his arm. Seth cried out in pain, struggling to shake Chaz\u2019s grip loose. \u201cGet off me!\u201d he cried, and shoved Chaz hard with his free hand. The dog flew across the room and landed against the wall with a shrill yelp. He immediately leapt up and charged Seth.</p><p>\u201cChaz, no!\u201d I yelled, and ran to grab his collar. Seth slammed out of my room, and seconds later the back door downstairs crashed against the wall. Yanking on the shorts I\u2019d worn earlier, I slid into my flip-flops and took off after my brother. What was wrong with him? I ran outside, the heavy, early-morning air thick and soupy as a mist rolled in from the river; I closed the back door and searched both sides of merchant\u2019s drive but found no signs of Seth anywhere. With my heart in my throat, I edged up the cobbles, ducked into the narrow alley that led to River Street, and hurried to the line of storefronts facing the river. I found myself alone, and I continued up the river walk at a jog. \u201cSeth?\u201d I called out. \u201cSeth!\u201d No answer. I still found myself alone at the west end, past the Hyatt, then made my way up to Factor\u2019s Walk and searched Bay Street. The early-hour fog hung like a cloud, and it slipped in and out of the oaks like inching fingers. The air was still; not even the slightest of breezes moved through the moss. I stood still, watched, and listened. Nothing. There was absolutely no sign of my brother.</p><p>It was at that point that I realized someone stood close by, and this time it wasn\u2019t just a crazy feeling that someone watched me. I knew it. I was sure it wasn\u2019t Seth. My adrenaline surged as my gaze roamed the area. Shadows fell and stretched from the lampposts, the parking meters hugging the curb, the storefront awnings, and trees; it was impossible to search every nook. I turned and walked up the cobbles, and just as I ducked into the alley next to Inksomnia I was shoved hard against the wall; my breath whooshed from my lungs. With my front pressed to the bricks and a hard body pressed against my back, I hadn\u2019t a clue who held me\u2014until he spoke. There was no mistaking that smooth voice and odd tinge of accent.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a death wish?\u201d he said, his voice low and annoyed, his mouth brushing my hair, close to my ear. \u201cOr are you just fucking crazy?\u201d</p><p>I tried to push against him, but he held me tight. \u201cYou\u2019re grating the side of my face into the brick, ass-hole. Get off me,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYour face is the last thing you need to worry about.\u201d He eased up a fraction, enough for my skin to separate from the mortar. I felt his mouth against my ear, and, swear to God, he sniffed my hair. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m starting to get that,\u201d I said, trying to look behind me, pushing against his steely weight. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem? Why are you on me?\u201d Worse was the fact that there was something I found exciting about him. I had no idea what it was\u2014he\u2019d threatened me twice now.</p><p>\u201cGet inside and stay there. Understand?\u201d</p><p>I did not like being bullied or told what to do. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me, and you definitely don\u2019t scare me,\u201d I said angrily. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not out here for my friggin\u2019 health, so why don\u2019t you back off!\u201d I growled, and shoved hard against him. It was like trying to move a packed freezer. Not a single inch budged. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suddenly, my body shifted from the wall and pushed up the steps. \u201cWhat the f\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove,\u201d he said, and this guy\u2019s hands wrapped around my waist to keep me from hauling ass. He all but pushed me along.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d I said, struggling against him but finding it was no use.</p> <p>\u201cShut up and come on,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to see something.\u201d</p><p>I continued to thrash despite the uselessness of it. Now it was on principle. I wasn\u2019t going to just meander along at his command.</p><p>For the first time in a long, long time, I felt vulnerable, but I\u2019d chew my own arm off before letting him know it.</p><p>At the top of the steps he guided me across the walk and up merchant\u2019s drive, then down the narrow, dank alley between Inksomnia and the Boho Boutique, where he gave me a shove. I stumbled, caught myself against the tabby wall (made of oyster shell and sand mortar), then sucked in a gasp. The strong scent of urine and metal filled my nostrils, and my quick reflexes jerked me back so fast that I fell against him; his steely grip held me upright. The streetlamp behind the Boho poured a hazy amber glow into the alley and onto the sprawled figure on the ground, unnaturally positioned as though all the bones were broken. I stared, unable to look away, my voice trapped inside my throat, at the body of a young male, his chest and throat literally flayed open. A dark substance splashed against the tabby wall behind him, splattered around his body. Blood. Wide, glassy eyes stared lifeless in the lamplight, and my hand flew to my mouth as I pushed against him to get away. \u201cHe\u2019s freaking dead,\u201d I said out loud, and looked into the face still hidden by shadows, at the one who\u2019d forced me to this place. \u201cYou,\u201d I whispered. I gagged, turned, and fought with fists against him. \u201cLet me go!\u201d I said, choking, and in the next instant my body shifted, and once again I found myself pressed against Inksomnia\u2019s back-door entrance.</p><p>He shook me. Hard. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me,\u201d he said. My head snapped back, and again I caught only glimpses of his profile. He was young. My age maybe. \u201cDo you understand now?\u201d he said, his voice dropping to a low pitch, his mouth moving to my ear. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe anymore. And it\u2019s not what you think.\u201d He gave me a shove. \u201cGo. I\u2019ll find your brother.\u201d</p> <p>For the first time in forever, fear gripped me by the throat. \u201cLeave my brother alone,\u201d I warned, my voice quivering. \u201cSwear to God, you\u2019d better leave him the fuck alone.\u201d</p><p>Just then he moved, ever so slightly, to the side, and I caught a subtle glimpse of his features. Straight nose, cut jaw, and his eyes\u2014they freaking glowed. The sight of them made me flinch.</p><p>\u201cGet inside. Bolt the door,\u201d he ground out as though in pain. He reached behind me, twisted the doorknob, threw open the door, and shoved me inside.</p><p>I fell against the stairs leading up to my and Seth\u2019s apartment, grasped the handrail, and steadied myself. When my vision focused on the doorway, he was gone. I slammed the door and threw the bolt, my heart slamming against my ribs as I backed away. I quickly climbed the stairs, my mind racing, scrambling to grasp what had happened, what I\u2019d just seen, and none of it made sense. Who was that guy? What did he want with me, and how did he know Seth?</p><p>An unfamiliar feeling claimed me\u2014panic. I hurried inside the apartment, Chaz whining a greeting as I ran past him and straight to the cordless. The police. I needed to call the police. A guy had been murdered not five hundred feet from my shop. Shit! I grabbed the cordless off the wall, and just as my finger landed on the illuminated \u201c9\u201d button, the phone was knocked from my hand, Chaz barked, and a pair of viselike fingers grasped my neck. My mind didn\u2019t have time to react. My vision blurred, and in the next second, darkness swept over me.</p><p>When next I woke, bright sunlight streamed in through the window and across my face. I was lying on the sofa, the brushed-wool throw pulled up to my chin. It took a few, but then everything rushed back to me, and I jumped up and ran to Seth\u2019s bedroom, threw open the door. A rush of relief crashed over me.</p> <p>Seth was sprawled across his bed, sound asleep, his window wide-open. I stared, shocked. How had he gotten inside? I hurried to him, pressed the back of my knuckles to his cheek; his skin felt cool against mine. My gaze raked over Seth\u2019s body; his face seemed paler, his dark brows and hair stark against his skin. I pushed his bangs from his eyes and sighed. The only explanation was drugs. How could I have allowed my little brother to get messed up in that hell? It was the only reason that could explain his weird behavior. I\u2019d been around users before; I\u2019d been one before. I knew the signs. Closing his window, I pulled the sheet over him. I\u2019d have to talk to Preacher.</p><p>Then, the rest of last night rushed back to me. The dead guy. The blood. I took off running, down the steps and out the back door. I didn\u2019t stop until I reached the alley next to the Boho. When I did, I nearly fell, I halted so harshly. My eyes searched the empty area. There was nothing. Absolutely nothing. No body. No blood. My head swam with confusion as I squatted next to the rough-textured tabby wall and ran my palm over its broken-oyster-shell surface. Nothing.</p><p>\u201cLose something, Riley?\u201d a voice said, startling me. I glanced over my shoulder as Bhing, owner of Boho, walked a stack of empty boxes to the Dumpster.</p><p>I rose and grinned. \u201cI thought I did,\u201d I said, shrugging, \u201cbut must have been mistaken. See ya.\u201d I walked away, and Bhing waved good-bye. Bhing was Filipino, maybe four feet eleven inches, and her black, shoulder-length, bobbed hair swung with each step she took as she hauled the boxes. Certainly she would have mentioned a murdered guy in her alley, had there been one. I walked away more confused than ever.</p><p>After I took Chaz for a walk, I ran over to Estelle\u2019s. \u201cDid you hear from Preacher yet?\u201d I asked. Preacher was the action taker, and I needed him. Badly.</p><p>\u201cAwe, yeah,\u201d said Estelle in her singsong voice, crushing herbs atop a long butcher-block table in the center of her kitchen. \u201cHe\u2019ll be in sometime today.\u201d She frowned. \u201cDey got somethin\u2019 goin\u2019 on over dere, and you know how dem conjurers are. What wrong wit you, girl? Dat brodder of yours any better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, really,\u201d I said, not wanting to worry her. \u201cHe\u2019s just not himself lately. Maybe he\u2019s going through some sort of adolescent guy change? I figured Preacher being his male role model, you know, would be able to talk to him?\u201d I didn\u2019t dare mention how Seth had reacted last night, or about the supposed dead body in the alley. Definitely not about the mysterious guy in shadows who seemed to be behind it all.</p><p>\u201cOh, now, dem menfolk are funny creatures, you know. Doesn\u2019t matter how old dey are.\u201d She laughed. \u201cAlways younguns. Always goin\u2019 through da change.\u201d</p> <p>I smiled, rose, took my cup to the sink, and gave Estelle a hug. She always made me feel better. \u201cYou okay here alone? Do you need anything? I can run to the store if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby,\u201d she said, and patted me on the arm. \u201cI\u2019m good jus like dis. You let me know how dat boy is doin\u2019, okay?\u201d</p><p>I agreed and said good-bye, and headed home to get ready for work. The magnitude of what was really going on with my brother struck later that evening. Struck like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>Nyx and I took turns checking on Seth, and this time it was Nyx\u2019s turn\u2014she insisted. I was finishing with a client, going over his tattoo-care instructions, so I told Nyx thanks and she disappeared into the back of the shop. It wasn\u2019t a solid minute later when I heard her shaky, freaked-out voice holler down the stairs. \u201cRi-ley! Get up here now!\u201d she screeched. \u201cHurry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d I said to the client, handing him the rest of his paperwork. \u201cBand looks awesome, but I gotta go\u2014sorry!\u201d When he chuckled and said, \u201cNo problem,\u201d I was already halfway up the steps to my apartment, my heart in my throat. I envisioned every horrible scenario I could imagine, from drug overdose to death\u2014both completely out of character (way out) for Seth, but he hadn\u2019t exactly been Seth Poe lately. I beat myself up a hundred times before I reached the top of the stairs, for not getting him to a doctor sooner. But the moment I saw Nyx, standing in the doorway of Seth\u2019s room, with a look of disbelief and terror on her face, swear to God, I nearly stopped breathing. I felt like a hole had been knocked through my chest, and I ran hard to the doorway and pushed past Nyx. Once inside, I jolted to a stop. \u201cWhoa!\u201d I shouted, and froze, my eyes glued to what I saw.</p><p>The air jammed in my lungs the moment realization hit me. I couldn\u2019t breathe, shout, or cry out. I merely stood, mouth slack, staring in complete disbelief as my baby brother\u2019s body hovered ten feet above his bed, face-up, body to ceiling, and totally, completely asleep.</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d Nyx cried. \u201cWake up! Oh, Riley\u2014what the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo get Preacher,\u201d I said, my eyes remaining fastened on my floating brother, and praying the Gullah had come home.</p><p>\u201cBut Seth! What\u2019s he doing?\u201d she said, her voice wailing, and she was literally jumping in place. She was starting to panic, and I was freaking close to it myself. \u201cThat\u2019s just not real! It\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Nyx, now!\u201d I said sharply. She was already gone and running down the steps before I realized Preacher might not be home yet. Estelle had just called earlier to say he was on his way from Da Island. Deciding not to wait on anybody, I dragged a chair over, climbed on it, reached on booted tiptoes to Seth\u2019s ankle, and tugged. His body, weightless, moved with very little pressure, so I eased down off the chair and pulled Seth with me. As effed up and weird as it sounded and looked, I positioned his body parallel with his bed, then tugged him down onto the mattress. The moment I turned him loose, he began to float back to the ceiling. \u201cShit! Seth!\u201d I grasped his ankle again as panic shot through me. What the hell?! What was I supposed to do? This was not happening! I scanned the room, hoping my vision would light on something that would give me a clue as to what the freak to do with Seth. Was he possessed? On drugs? People didn\u2019t float. Oh, Jesus, he had to be possessed. I should have paid more attention in my Catholic studies as a kid. I held on to him now, completely out of my mind, and finally, I did the only thing I could think of: I sat on him to keep him down. Seth showed no signs of waking up; he actually looked as peaceful as he ever did when asleep, and I wanted him to damn well stay like that until Preacher arrived. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Within minutes\u2014maybe even seconds, I really lost track of time\u2014a rush of heavy treads hurrying up the steps met my ears, and thankfully, it was more than one set of feet moving. \u201cHurry up!\u201d I hollered.</p><p>Then everything happened at once. Preacher burst into the room; Chaz ran in barking his head off; Seth woke up; Nyx screamed. And in one fluid motion\u2014so fast I didn\u2019t even see him move\u2014my brother shoved me off of him with brutal strength, I flew hard across the room and landed against the wall, and Seth disappeared out of the already open window. The moment my body landed, I pushed up and ran toward the window. \u201cSeth!\u201d I called out frantically, and searched the area of cobbles below his window. Vacant. Chaz jumped up, his paws on the sill and still barking like a mad dog, and I searched up and down River Street in the waning light. \u201cSeth!\u201d I called again. It was no use. He was gone. And I was in sickening shock. I didn\u2019t think beyond that; I pushed off the sill and ran for the door, screaming my brother\u2019s name. \u201cSeth!\u201d No way could he have made that fall and just . . . run off. Unless he was using. Dammit! I made it ten feet before Preacher grabbed me around my waist and pulled me to a halt. \u201cLet me go!\u201d I said, unthinking, and pulled hard against him. He held fast, and I went nowhere. Overcome with distress, I sagged against him. My brain couldn\u2019t make sense of anything. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Preacher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl,\u201d Preacher said gently. \u201cShush now.\u201d Somewhere behind me, Nyx wept softly. He touched my chin, and I turned and searched his dark eyes. He asked me nothing, just commanded me with gentle urgency. Obviously, he knew something, since none of this seemed to be freaking him out. \u201cYou come wit me now,\u201d he said, and headed out of the door. Nothing I looked at was the same as before. Nothing and no one. I don\u2019t know why I felt that so fast, but I did; all from just five words spoken from the mouth of a wise Gullah root doctor. Sensations of fear, panic, anxiety, rushed me. That, and the fact that my levitating, drug-using brother had flown out of a two-story building and disappeared.</p> <p>Knowing what her answer would be, I glanced at Nyx. \u201cWill you close up for me and wait here, in case he comes back?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHe ain\u2019t comin\u2019 back tonight,\u201d Preacher said from the hall, and my stomach dropped. \u201cIt\u2019s time now. Come,\u201d he commanded. I drew in a deep breath and numbly followed Preacher out, trailing behind him into the afterlight.</p><p>Part 4</p><p>INTRODUCTIONS</p><p>I had absolutely no idea where we were going, but I followed Preacher with blind faith and silence, out into Savannah\u2019s humid dusk. I almost felt like I was out of my body, invisible to everyone around me. All I could think about was my brother; all I really wanted to hear was that Seth would be okay. I doubted seriously I\u2019d hear it right now. Preacher moved wordlessly, and he\u2019d speak when he was damn well ready. Meanwhile, I was dying inside: I fought tears and panic. I felt like screaming at the top of my lungs. I kept my mouth closed, but my silence burned in my throat.</p> <p>As we hurried along, I knew it wouldn\u2019t do me a bit of good to ask the old conjurer where we were headed; he\u2019d either ignore me or tell me to hush and wait till we git dere, so I simply kept up. A fair number of people were out and about as we crossed Bay Street; we hurried past a walking ghost tour heading toward the Kehoe House. People were sitting on park benches or strolling through the squares\u2014none of them privy to the fact that something very unnatural had just occurred.</p><p>The threat of rain hung heavy in the air, and I could taste it and the ever-present brine on my tongue; no sooner had that thought crossed my mind than distant thunder rolled overhead. Shadows stretched long over the squares as lamplight fell over monuments and benches, making everything seem distorted, aberrant. Even the towering oaks seemed menacing, with long, outstretched arms reaching toward me as I passed beneath, and moss looking more like stringy witch\u2019s hair than one of Savannah\u2019s icons. The world around me sounded indistinct and displaced, like I was holding a seashell up to my ear. I shook off the weirdness as best as I could, and hurried along with Preacher.</p><p>We walked, nonstop and silent, all the way to Taylor Street, where the old Gullah turned right. When we hit Monterey Square, he crossed the street and stopped at the large white-brick historic three-story building on the corner. Black wrought-iron balconies on the second and third stories faced the square; the house was canopied by mammoth, moss-draped oaks\u2014typical of the district. On the front gate hung a brass plate that read HOUSE OF DUPR\u00c9, 1851. Sure\u2014the Dupr\u00e9 House. I\u2019d seen it a hundred times growing up; I never knew anything about it or its inhabitants, and I couldn\u2019t understand why or how they\u2019d be able to help my brother, unless they were some rich, radical interventionists. Preacher, though, he had connections, and I trusted anything\u2014and I mean anything\u2014he deemed necessary. Maybe the Dupr\u00e9s were into some of the same dark African magic? I hoped to hell so.</p><p>As if Preacher had heard my thoughts, he stopped at the front step and turned to me. It was dark enough out now that I could see only the whites of his eyes, his silver hair against his ebony skin, but I knew he studied me hard. He always did. \u201cYou drink your tea dis mornin\u2019, right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The odd question stunned me, but I answered. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t skip any mornin\u2019s since I been gone, right?\u201d</p> <p>I knew better than to question right now. When Preacher was dead serious about something, he didn\u2019t play around, and right now he was serious\u2014no matter how bizarre the question was. \u201cNo, sir, I didn\u2019t skip any mornings. I never do.\u201d Inside, though, I was screaming What the freak do you need to know that for? I wisely kept the comment to myself.</p><p>\u201cI know you, girl,\u201d Preacher said softly, \u201cand it\u2019s killin\u2019 you to keep dat purty mouth shut. You wanna know what it is we\u2019re doin\u2019 here, and how dese folk can help your brodder\u2014I know dat much. You wanna know why your brodder was floatin\u2019, and how he jumped and ran off. But I tell you now\u2014don\u2019t shoot dat mouth off in dere, even if you want to. You keep dem lips sealed tight shut, and don\u2019t make much movement, and for God\u2019s sake don\u2019t hit nobody if dey put dere hands on you. What you\u2019re gonna see and hear in dere? It won\u2019t settle in your brain or in your heart right away, and I\u2019m askin\u2019 you to just accept it.\u201d He placed a hand on my shoulder, and it was strong, warm. \u201cPromise me dat, Riley Poe.\u201d</p><p>If I wasn\u2019t shaken before, I was now. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever heard my surrogate grandfather say so many words at one time in my entire life. But Preacher man would do anything for me and Seth, and that was what all this was about\u2014Seth. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d I answered quietly. Just the fact that Preacher warned me against someone putting their hands on me put my guard instantly up. He knew I had a thing about people\u2014strangers\u2014touching me. I had reflexes I couldn\u2019t help. Besides. Why would anyone in the Dupr\u00e9 House touch me? I drew a deep breath and let it out slowly. \u201cI promise,\u201d I said, and hoped like hell I could keep it.</p><p>Preacher gave a single nod, then turned to the door; he didn\u2019t have to knock or ring a bell. The moment I stepped into the porch light beside him, the double-hung slabs of solid oak and brass opened, and an older man in a pristine tailored gray suit stood in the entranceway. Tall and wiry, with close-clipped gray hair, he gave me a double take, then addressed Preacher.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re waiting for you in the study, monsieur,\u201d the man said with a vague French accent. He didn\u2019t verbally acknowledge me, but he checked out my dragons, angel wing, and attire: a gauzy flower-print skirt that came just above my knees, a ripped white tee, black leather ankle boots, and a wide black velvet choker. \u201cThis way,\u201d he said, and inclined his head. He started up the foyer, back ramrod straight, and turned into a room off the main floor, near the back. We followed, my heels clicking sharply against the parquet flooring, breaking a deafening silence. Antique vases, ancient oil portraits, and pristine turn-of-the-century furniture adorned what small portion of the house I could see. The moment I stepped into the room, I stiffened. No fewer than fifteen people were gathered, and all sets of eyes rested on me as we entered. Only six weren\u2019t Gullah. A young girl, who seemed to be around the same age as Seth, stood beside an elegant, petite older woman and an older man. Immediately, my gaze scanned the room; I noticed two younger guys, around my age I guessed, and then I saw the hot guy who\u2019d stared at me through Inksomnia\u2019s storefront window. He stood near the back, the farthest away from me, and four big Gullah guys\u2014I knew them all\u2014stood around him, almost . . . shielding him. Seemingly un-bothered by it, he was propped casually against the wall, arms crossed over his chest, brown hair sideswept and falling over eyes that, even from this distance, I could tell studied me with expressionless intensity. Low-slung faded jeans with a ragged hole in the thigh, a leather belt, and a snug white tee covered a lean, well-defined body. Then I noticed his jaw, his profile, and familiarity surged through me. I stared back, slightly unhinged as another profile, in shadows as I was held against a wall, rushed over me. It was him. What the freak? But before I could demand what the hell was going on, a man\u2019s voice pulled my attention away, effortlessly, as if I had zero control. It was smooth, French, and mesmerizing.</p><p>\u201cBonsoir, ma ch\u00e8re,\u201d the elderly man said as he slowly rose from a wine-colored upholstered wingback chair near the hearth. His gaze locked directly onto mine as he drew closer, and I found it difficult to think of anyone or anything else except him and his voice. He moved so gracefully, it almost seemed as though he glided across the massive room. Stopping just a few feet from me, he gave a small, sophisticated bow and a warm smile. \u201cAccueillir \u00e0 la maison de Dupr\u00e8.\u201d</p><p>I stared blankly at the man, and just as I was about to tell him I had no idea what the hell he was saying, I felt Preacher\u2019s hand move to the small of my back. I took that as a sign to keep my mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cOh, Gilles,\u201d said the petite woman, also with a French accent, \u201cin English, love.\u201d She gave me a glance.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh, oui\u2014pardon,\u201d the man\u2014apparently Gilles\u2014said to me, switching to English. \u201cMy apologies, young lady. \u2019Tis an old habit difficult to break, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d He gave me a curt nod. \u201cWelcome to the House of Dupr\u00e9.\u201d A sharp cerulean blue gaze met mine and held it. \u201cWe\u2019ve been expecting you.\u201d</p><p>What I wanted to say was, That\u2019s great, really, but how can you help my brother? And what about the guy over there who has been stalking me? Firm pressure at my back from Preacher kept the question in check. With my eyes, though, I screamed, What\u2019s going on? Why have you been expecting me?</p><p>In the next instant, Preacher began speaking to Gilles Dupr\u00e9 in perfect French. I waited, stunned, and picked up only one word in the fast translation: Seth. It was getting more and more difficult to keep my mouth shut, and already I\u2019d had more than I could take of all the silent stares and scrutiny. But just as I was about to lose it, Gilles turned back to me. He grasped both of my hands with his, and I stiffened. Preacher\u2019s body went rigid beside me, but I remained calm. Well, calm for me, anyway. At least I didn\u2019t flip the old guy onto his back.</p> <p>Gilles glanced down at our joined hands, and I watched his eyes follow the tail of my dragon tattoo up my arm before finding my gaze. Again, the sensation of complete fascination came over me as he spoke. \u201cRiley Poe. The painted one,\u201d he said, almost with admiration. \u201cYou are well loved by your dark brethren here, as is your brother. You are . . . family.\u201d He released my hands and gave a grave nod. \u201cI do understand about family, ma ch\u00e8re.\u201d With a long, elegant sweep of his hand, he glanced to the others. \u201cThis is my family, Ms. Poe. There sits my beloved, Elise, my sweet daughter, Josephine, and my boys\u201d\u2014he motioned farther with his hand\u2014\u201cS\u00e9raphin, Jean-Luc, and over there in the corner, brooding, is my eldest, Eligius.\u201d</p><p>I stared wordlessly at the family Dupr\u00e9. Elise, petite, with perfectly coiffed dark hair pulled back into an elegant ponytail, was at least fifteen years younger than her husband. She smiled warmly at me and gave a short, sophisticated nod. Their daughter, Josephine, stood next to her mother\u2019s chair, watching me with inquisitiveness, and looked as though she wanted to say something as badly as I did. Light brown hair hung in naturally wild curls to nearly her waist and parted in the middle, long bangs pinned back hippy style, and wide cerulean blue eyes just like her parents\u2019 stared blatantly at me. With a pair of dark skinny jeans, bright pink high-top sneakers, and a black T-shirt with a hot pink peace sign on the front, she looked like every other average teenager. She glanced at my feet, then met my gaze. \u201cI like your boots. And it\u2019s Josie.\u201d She gave a wicked grin.</p><p>Preacher once more pressed firmly against my back, silently telling me to keep quiet. I stared at Josie without saying a word, and her mouth tipped up into a smile\u2014almost as if she knew my thoughts.</p><p>S\u00e9raphin and Jean-Luc studied me, neither saying a word, and they looked so much alike, they could\u2019ve easily been twins. Both with athletic physiques and dark blond hair, S\u00e9raphin wore his close clipped while Jean-Luc\u2019s was longer and crazy. They regarded me in silence, yet their expressions revealed intense curiosity and something else I couldn\u2019t define just then. Then Jean-Luc flashed me a peace sign and grinned. All I knew was, no matter how many in the room stared me down, Eligius was the one that affected me most. And that totally irritated me.</p><p>I gave only a brief glance at him. Eligius Dupr\u00e9. Clearly, I was familiar with his good looks and harsh stares and was beginning to get really pissed off at him and this whole situation. What the hell was all this about? Why had Eligius been following me, what had happened to the dead body, and\u2014Shit! I was confused. Why had Preacher brought me here? How could these people help Seth? And why couldn\u2019t I say anything? I glanced at Preacher, who also said nothing, but I knew that look. It said, Do what I said, girl. Finally, I returned my gaze to Gilles, who warmly smiled. I could do nothing more than wait.</p> <p>\u201cNow that you have observed ma famille, ch\u00e8re, know us well. Just as we know you well; we will all become quite . . . close.\u201d He grazed my jaw with a long, elegant finger, and I struggled not to knock it away. He smiled. \u201cAh, oui. Your Preacher has told us of your dislike for human touch.\u201d He chuckled and slid a finger across my jaw once more. \u201cI can assure you\u2014\u2019tis not what you think.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the Dupr\u00e9s chuckled as well\u2014all except Eligius, and despite my previous promise, I just couldn\u2019t help myself. I narrowed my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve no idea what I think.\u201d</p><p>Preacher made a hissing sound beside me and muttered an African word whose meaning I didn\u2019t know but had a pretty good idea about. I gave him a curious glance. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked under my breath, although I knew good and well what.</p><p>\u201cCome, my fierce painted one,\u201d Gilles said. He grasped my elbow and gently tugged me toward the chair he\u2019d vacated earlier, and for some reason, I allowed it. \u201cSit. We\u2019ve much to discuss.\u201d</p><p>I sat down, throwing a curious look at Preacher, who simply stared back expressionless. I didn\u2019t have to wait long.</p><p>Gilles stood at the hearth, elbow propped against a long, polished antique mantel, and began. \u201cYour Gullah brethren and my family have known one another for many years,\u201d he said, his accent light, delicate. \u201cAnd with regret I confess we\u2019ve all grown complacent.\u201d He sighed, briefly closed his eyes, then looked again at me. \u201cWe should never have let our guard down, even for a moment. It was\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGilles,\u201d his wife, Elise, said softly. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui, you\u2019re so right, love,\u201d he said. \u201cBest to just come out and say it.\u201d He sighed again. \u201cA contract was made, centuries ago, between Preacher\u2019s ancestors and the Dupr\u00e9 famille,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would supply us with . . . necessities, and we in turn would give full protection to the city and outlying islands. A guardianship, if you will.\u201d</p><p>Gilles watched me, waiting for an understanding that I absolutely couldn\u2019t give to him; I had no freaking idea what he was talking about. Although I wanted to question how an old man, a middle-aged woman, a teenage girl, and three young guys could still be carrying on some aged contract to guard an entire city\u2014and from what\u2014I kept quiet. A marathon for me, actually, but if Preacher\u2019s grave expression meant anything, I knew this was something I needed to chill out with and listen to\u2014for now, anyway. Somehow, this had to link back to what in hell was happening to my little brother. And strangely enough, I sensed a freakish strength radiating from Gilles Dupr\u00e9. I couldn\u2019t explain it, but I think it helped keep my mouth shut and my ass firmly planted in the chair.</p><p>Gilles continued. \u201cYou see, my painted one, your brother and his young friends disrupted a tomb and inadvertently released two vicious souls\u2014a pair of brothers. Valerian and Victorian Arcos.\u201d He stepped close to me and cocked his head. \u201cThey, like us, are descendants from a powerful, rare bloodline of the strigoi in Romania. They will stop at nothing, ch\u00e8re, to take what they want, and trust me\u201d\u2014he gave a wan smile\u2014\u201cthey will indeed want. They will not be so easy to subdue again.\u201d</p><p>Strigoi? What the hell? The vacant stare in my eyes had to be blatantly obvious; then, it hit me, and I couldn\u2019t believe it. I glanced around at the entire room, despite having Preacher tell me to be still and keep quiet. I just couldn\u2019t help it. The Gullah fixed their dark stares on me; the Dupr\u00e9s watched silently, all waiting for my response, I supposed. Slowly, I rose from the chair, shook my head, and gave a short laugh of disbelief. I still couldn\u2019t believe it. I turned to Preacher. \u201cZombies, Preach? Seriously? You think Seth and his friends unleashed zombies from da hell stone? No disrespect\u2014you know I heed your warnings\u2014but zombies? You know I don\u2019t believe in stuff like that, and I don\u2019t have time for this,\u201d I said, and started for the door. I glanced back over my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve got to look for my brother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>The familiar voice made my head spin around, and I gasped\u2014then swore\u2014in complete shock. Eligius Dupr\u00e9 blocked the doorway and stood so close, I could smell whatever earthy, seductive scent he was wearing. How had he moved so freaking fast? Every Gullah in the room, Preacher included, moved toward me, the room filled with a mixture of frantic African and French languages. All at once, the overwhelming urge to scream, cry, and run like hell overcame me, and I pushed past Eligius Dupr\u00e9 in an effort to try. \u201cMove it, gar\u00e7on,\u201d I said sarcastically as a sob stuck in my throat and my voice cracked\u2014two very unlikely behaviors for me. The foyer was clear, and I ran all the way to the front door, and then out of it. Outside, at the bottom of the steps, Eligius stood, waiting.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d I swore under my breath and stopped short. Again\u2014how had he moved so fast? Twice! It was . . . impossible, and my brain couldn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t\u2014wrap around it. Wouldn\u2019t even try. I honest to God could think of nothing better to say and was again in complete shock. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d I asked, breathless with disbelief.</p> <p>\u201cTrying to keep you from making an ass of yourself,\u201d he said quietly, his smooth voice seemingly inside my head. \u201cNow, come back inside if you want to find your brother.\u201d He took two steps toward me, his features partially hidden by shadows. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>The look of distrust on my face must have been more noticeable than I thought, because Eligius gave a slight smile. \u201cYes, there was a dead guy in the alley last night. I didn\u2019t kill him. And we\u2019re not zombies.\u201d He inclined his head. \u201cCan we go now?\u201d</p><p>When someone else said zombies, it sounded even more stupid than when I\u2019d said it. What had I been thinking? But where Preacher was concerned, nothing\u2014including zombies\u2014could be ruled out. Preacher and Estelle firmly believed in them, among other things.</p><p>\u201cChild, come back in here now,\u201d said Preacher from behind me. \u201cTime is gittin\u2019 by us, and your brodder is out dere.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Compelled by previous experiences to listen to Preacher, I gave Eligius one final hard stare, climbed the steps, and moved past my surrogate grandfather into the foyer wordlessly, but I didn\u2019t miss the look he gave Eligius before following me in. I\u2019d seen it hundreds of times before. It was a warning look, with the threat of retribution in his dark eyes. And that just didn\u2019t make sense to me, even as I did as he asked. I entered the gathering room, hopefully for the last effing time, and was surprised to see everyone pretty much exactly where I\u2019d left them.</p><p>Gilles came forward. \u201cMy apologies, ch\u00e8re.

There are things of which you must know.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Preacher, who gave a short nod. I crossed the room and eased into the chair. Josie stood close, and she regarded me with an amused look. I sought out the other two Dupr\u00e9 boys, and their expressions were much the same as their sister\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cAs you can see, we\u2019re not what you\u2019d call . . . ordinary,\u201d Gilles said, pacing slowly now before me. I crossed my legs, folded my arms over my chest, and kept my gaze trained on the older man: his pricey suit, his manicured nails, his aristocratic profile. In my peripheral I noted Eligius by the door, probably blocking any further escapes from me. My mind was a jumbled mess of doubts and panic; I\u2019d do anything to help find Seth. But this was seriously wicked crazy.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d asked Gilles. He stopped and looked me in the eye. \u201cSincerely, ch\u00e8re?\u201d</p><p>My skin turned to ice; it seemed as if the old man had read my mind, or had I said it out loud? \u201cYes,\u201d I responded in a sure, confident voice, calling off all earlier agreements I\u2019d made with Preacher to keep quiet. And I was a little irritated. \u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>Gilles nodded. \u201cBon. Very good to hear.\u201d He drew closer, stopped, and inclined his head. \u201cBut in order for you to help your brother, you must stay, and listen with an open mind and heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I responded, recalling Preacher\u2019s nearly exact same words.</p> <p>\u201cChildren?\u201d he said to his family.</p><p>Everything that happened next happened so freaking fast, I could barely keep up. I\u2019d turned my head slightly to glance at Preacher, and when I looked back at Gilles, he wasn\u2019t there. Jean-Luc was in his place. I searched out Josie, and while she\u2019d just been standing beside her mother, she was now where Eligius had been, and he was now standing near the hearth. I stood, spun around, confused, only to notice that Gilles and Elise had traded places. No one stood where they once had, and they\u2019d moved right before my eyes. I looked around, unsure, and felt myself beginning to shake nervously. \u201cWhat\u2019s . . . going on?\u201d I asked quietly. What was this, some sort of freakish effing Cirque du Soleil family? French illusionists? Was I losing my mind?</p><p>In the amount of time it took me to blink, Gilles stood once again before me. His smile was warm; his eyes gleamed . . . something else entirely different. Then a throat cleared loudly, and I glanced up to see S\u00e9raphin perched on the top of a tall bookcase in the corner. He jumped down with complete ease and was at my side in less than\u2014swear to God\u2014a second. I squelched a scream.</p><p>\u201cWe are creatures of the afterlight,\u201d said Gilles quietly. He reached down, grasped my hand, and continued to speak as he drew me across the room. I\u2019m not sure why, but I willingly went as my mind spun wildly, trying to figure out exactly what a creature of the afterlight was. \u201cNearly two centuries ago I was taken one night by another\u2014an Arcos\u2014and to this very day I know not why.\u201d He closed his eyes and shook his head. \u201cI left while my quickening took place, and once I was fully turned, I realized I couldn\u2019t bear to be without my beloved family, so I selfishly took them, one by one, as they slept in their beds. I forced them to drink my tainted blood, and they, too, became like me. It was a hellish month of quickening that followed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGilles, non,\u201d said Elise quietly, and in the blink of an eye she was beside him, her arm linked through his. She laid her head on his shoulder. \u201cNot selfish, mon bienaim\u00e9 .\u201d</p><p>Now I shook my head, in complete and utter confusion. \u201cTook them\u2014creatures of the afterlight? Quickening? What does all that mean?\u201d I asked. \u201cAnd what\u2019s it got to do with my brother and me?\u201d Afterlight\u2014what the Gullah called dusk\u2014I got that; but the Arcos brothers, vicious killers, creatures of the afterlight? None of it made sense.</p> <p>Eligius was immediately at my side, and his eyes bored hard into mine. \u201cThe Arcoses are vampiric descendants of the strigoi,\u201d he said, his voice seemingly inside my head once more. It was weird to finally see a face to match the voice, and I felt as though my gaze was fixed to his. His lips moved, and I couldn\u2019t quite take my eyes off them, so he must have been speaking out loud. He gripped my arm, and just that fast, my reflexes kicked in. Only, they didn\u2019t work. His grip was like a steel vise, and I couldn\u2019t budge him. He drew closer, and from the corner of my eye I saw the Gullah men take a step forward. \u201cA bloodline rarely heard of outside of Romanian tales and folklore. We are all considered members of the Kindred, all with a vein of strigoi blood, but there are differences. We are immortal and crave human blood, but our hunger has been satisfied in other ways\u2014humane ways\u2014by the Preacher, and his ancestors before him. The Arcoses have been entombed for over a hundred and fifty years, and now they\u2019re out, and they\u2019re not humane. They\u2019re hunting.\u201d His face was so close to mine, I could see the various flecks of color in his angry eyes. \u201cThey have no mercy, no remorse; they cannot be satiated. And they will not stop.\u201d</p><p>My thoughts jumped to the dead man in the alley, the distorted way his lifeless body lay, the way his flesh had been ripped open, the blood, and Eligius didn\u2019t let go of my arm. He held it, steady, his gaze not once leaving mine. My heart slammed into my rib cage, and my skin tingled where he touched. At once, the entire room didn\u2019t exist; only us. He\u2019d been the one to give me straight answers, so I asked one more straight question. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d I said, my voice strong but shaky. I kept my eyes boldly trained on his as I awaited an answer, and I vaguely noticed the flinch in his expression at the word what.</p><p>\u201cWe are vampiric, but not like them,\u201d he said heatedly, under his breath, and it was the first time I realized the slightest trace of an accent was French. The muscles in his jaws tensed, and again my eyes were drawn to his full lips. \u201cAs my father said, we made a contract with your brethren. They have sustained our lives, and we have protected the city against rogue vampires.\u201d With his head lowered, his eyes searched mine, and his voice lowered. \u201cBut the Arcoses have been freed, and now we have a major fucking problem, ma ch\u00e8re.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon, that\u2019s enough,\u201d said Elise, her voice sweet and strong at the same time. A slight shift in the air brushed across my face and made me wince, and when I opened my eyes, Eligius was across the room, leaning against the wall as though he\u2019d never moved.</p><p>I looked directly at Gilles. \u201cHow does any of this help my brother?\u201d I asked, then sought out Preacher, who stood quietly against the door. \u201cHow?\u201d Suddenly, the weight of what couldn\u2019t possibly be happening hit me full force in the chest, and I sagged where I stood, unable to breathe. \u201cSeth,\u201d I choked my brother\u2019s name out, and the lining in my throat burned.</p><p>Preacher was immediately at my side, and while he didn\u2019t say anything, his reassuring hands on my shoulders put me at as much ease as I could be.</p><p>\u201cYour brother is in the quickening,\u201d said Gilles, and I didn\u2019t miss the sympathetic note in his voice. \u201cAnd it takes a moon\u2019s full cycle for transformation to complete. We feel that he and his friends, because of their unintentional aid to the Arcoses, are safe for now. Had the brothers wanted to kill them, they indeed would be dead already, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>It was too much, even for me, to take in. My mind reeled at everything I\u2019d been told, at what I\u2019d seen, and no matter how hard I tried, no matter what I knew of Preacher and his beliefs, I had a hell of a time believing I was standing in one of Savannah\u2019s prominent historic buildings with a loving family claiming to be vampires descended from France and Romania; that there were two dangerous, bloodthirsty rogue vampires loose in the city; and that my baby brother was running with them.</p> <p>That he was going to become one of them. My stomach felt sick.</p><p>Everything that had happened that night at Bonaventure washed over me in a heavy, suffocating wave: the uneasy feeling I\u2019d gotten, the absence of cicadas, and Seth\u2019s slow transformation from sweet, lovable brother to the cold, detached boy I barely recognized. Chaz had noticed it, too, and suddenly all of the symptoms made sense. Seth slept all the time, had hypersensitivity to light and no appetite. At first fevered, he\u2019d grown . . . cooler. Not cold, but notably cooler in temperature. He\u2019d almost attacked me. He\u2019d thrown Chaz across the room. I closed my eyes tightly and tried to breathe. \u201cOh, God,\u201d I muttered, a pain so fierce lodging deep in the pit of my stomach that it nearly made me double over. I wrapped my arms around my middle. \u201cHow can it be true?\u201d I turned to Preacher. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are many things in this world of which most mortals haven\u2019t a clue exist,\u201d said Gilles, directly by my side now. \u201cUntil it\u2019s too late, of course.\u201d</p><p>I turned my gaze on him, unable to do little more than stare. I then took in the room, the Dupr\u00e9 family, my Gullah friends. My brain was in overload and could take not another second more. I turned to Preacher. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get out of here.\u201d He simply kept his gaze trained on me, wordless.</p><p>\u201cWe thought it may be too much at once,\u201d said Gilles, his hands folded behind his back. The weighty expression on his face didn\u2019t sit so well with me. \u201cBut there\u2019s one more thing you should know.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve a rare blood type, Riley Poe. Only the second mortal I\u2019ve ever encountered with it in my entire existence.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m O positive,\u201d I replied. \u201cThat\u2019s not rare.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head. \u201cHave you given any thought as to why so many of your brethren are with us today?\u201d</p><p>Glancing quickly around the room, I shrugged. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p> <p>He placed a hand on my shoulder, and every single Gullah took a step forward. Gilles smiled. \u201cThey\u2019re here to protect you, child. Your blood type is especially rare . . . to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGilles, stop scaring the girl,\u201d said Elise, suddenly by his side. She looked at me and spoke freely for the first time. \u201cYour Preacher has masked your blood potency for years,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYou\u2019re in no real danger here, ch\u00e8re, and your fellows are here because they love and cherish you. They\u2019re just being cautious, and it is that fierce loyalty which has kept our families and the contract bound for centuries. And it shall remain that way.\u201d</p><p>Preacher put his hand against the small of my back. \u201cYour tea dat you drink every mornin\u2019? It keeps your blood masked.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him with wide eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve been drugging me?\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth lifted, ever so slightly, in a smile only I recognized. \u201cFor your own good,\u201d he said gently. \u201cWe\u2019ve known of your powerful blood since you was a baby, right. Now, listen to him,\u201d he said, inclining his head to Gilles. \u201cDere\u2019s somethin\u2019 we have to do for now.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded and gave my full attention to Gilles. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d Although I had a difficult time realizing that I was like a filet mignon to these guys.</p><p>Gilles clasped his hands in front of him. \u201cThe Arcoses will not be stopped easily. They will be difficult to find\u2014as will your brother and his friends. They hide during the daylight and move through shadows in the darkness.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t thought about that. No wonder Riggs was acting so ridiculous in the shop.</p><p>\u201cAnd I feel they are on more than a hunt. Retaliation in the end, no doubt.\u201d He turned to me and studied my face with intensity. \u201cYou see, Victorian and Valerian are youths\u2014all of twenty-one and twenty-two years\u2014although extremely cunning and deadly. Their appearances will fool you\u2014never trust them. Their faces are beautiful and innocent; their souls are damned. We will do everything in our power to lure them out of hiding, and we\u2019ll need your help.\u201d</p><p>Again, I nodded, even though everything Gilles was saying felt as though he was saying it to someone else, not me. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re building an army,\u201d Gilles said gravely. \u201cFrom our city\u2019s youth\u2014your brother included. It\u2019s what they\u2019d intended a hundred and fifty years ago, and it\u2019s why they were entombed. They will seek out their troops and victims from the darkest dregs of the city. Now, times are more dangerous, and this time they shall be destroyed.\u201d He inclined his head. \u201cYou know the underground, oui?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnderground as in . . . what, exactly?\u201d I asked, although I sort of guessed what he meant. I didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cDark places, drugs,\u201d Preacher clarified. \u201cDem dark dancin\u2019 clubs you used to go to, and dos bad folk you hung out wit when you was a youngun.\u201d</p><p>Inside, I cringed. I\u2019d sworn\u2014vowed\u2014that I\u2019d never go back to that life again. I\u2019d put it behind me for good. But this was my brother being dragged into stuff way worse than I ever dreamed of doing. I looked Gilles Dupr\u00e9 in the eye. \u201cI said I\u2019ll do anything.\u201d</p><p>Briefly, Gilles closed his eyes, and a slight smile tipped his mouth upward. \u201cBon. For now, we must watch, wait, and try to protect as many as possible. The city has grown\u2014it won\u2019t be as easy as it once was. And Eligius will remain by your side at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said at the same time Eligius argued. We glanced at each other; then I turned to Gilles. \u201cI appreciate your concern, really, but I don\u2019t need anyone to protect me. Preacher lives right next door. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>With a quick glance at Preacher, who gave one single, short nod, Gilles, in a fraction of a second, grasped my forearms tightly and drew his head close. I blinked in surprise, and just that fast his face grew close and sickly distorted, his jaw unhinged, and every tooth in his mouth grew long, sharp, jagged, his eyes no longer blue but pure white, with only a pinpoint bloodred pupil. I literally shook where I stood, my breath jammed in my throat; I couldn\u2019t breathe, move, or scream.</p><p>In the next blink, Gilles\u2019 face returned to normal\u2014what I perceived as normal, anyway. He was a handsome, distinguished older man. Regret now set firmly in his clear blue eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, ch\u00e8re,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cBut you do now see why you must allow Eligius\u2019 aid?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not Phin or Luc?\u201d Eligius questioned quietly. \u201cI\u2019m not a wise choice.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of Gilles. Had what just happened truly happened? Was that what would become of Seth? I resisted the urge to reach up and touch his face.</p><p>\u201cOui,\u201d Gilles said. \u201cThat is what would become of your brother. Worse, I\u2019m afraid. He will have . . . no control. A newling, driven by desperate, painful hunger.\u201d</p><p>I knew then that Gilles could read my thoughts, and I couldn\u2019t be sure whether he read them at random, or just when he thought it was pertinent to the situation. That was yet another insane thing for my brain to try and wrangle. I chanced a look at him, and he gave a slight grin.</p><p>\u201cAnd you,\u201d Gilles said to Eligius, \u201care the choice I\u2019ve made, mon fils. You are the strongest of us and can better protect her. She must carry on her proprietorship as usual, and begin to ease into a life underground. We cannot allow the Arcoses to suspect otherwise, oui?\u201d Gilles turned his look to me. \u201cYou will be perfectly safe with Eligius. Just . . . make sure you drink your tea.\u201d Jean-Luc, S\u00e9raphin\u2014rather, Luc and Phin\u2014and Josie chuckled.</p><p>After a quick glance at Eligius, I turned my question to Gilles. \u201cDoes he do what you just did?\u201d</p><p>Gilles gave a nod. \u201cOui.\u201d</p><p>A cynical laugh escaped me. \u201cAnd you want him to stay in my house? With me? While I\u2019m helpless and sleeping?\u201d</p><p>Gilles didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>I inclined my head. \u201cWho is Eligius supposed to be protecting me from?\u201d</p><p>Gilles\u2019 stern, regretful expression made my heart drop to my stomach. \u201cYour brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Arcoses as well,\u201d said Elise. \u201cThey\u2019re lethal, darling. More than you can imagine. Because of their strigoi bloodline they can appear out of body. They can appear in your dreams, if they wished it. And your brother, while still in the quickening phase, has strong mortal tendencies which would lure him to what he\u2019s most familiar with\u2014you. Unfortunately, he also has vampiric tendencies, and those would indeed overpower his weak mortal desires, including his love for you.\u201d Her look was one of pity. \u201cHe\u2019d not be able to help himself.\u201d</p><p>I felt sickened at the thought that my brother would hurt me, but I knew now that he would. He\u2019d already tried. I had no choice but to trust the Dupr\u00e9s; Preacher did. And I fully trusted Preacher and his family with my and Seth\u2019s lives.</p><p>Once more, Gilles clasped my hands between his. \u201cEnough for one day, oui? I am positive Eligius can give you a Dupr\u00e9 family history and answer any questions you may have.\u201d The smile that tipped his mouth was noticeable only by me, I was sure. \u201cYou\u2019ll be spending a lot of time together, no doubt.\u201d Then he cast a severe stare at Eligius. \u201cShe goes nowhere without you, oui?\u201d</p><p>The muscles in Eligius\u2019 jaws flinched. \u201cOui, Papa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you begin your searches underground, S\u00e9raphin, Jean-Luc, and Josephine will be there, as well.\u201d</p><p>I shot a glance at Josie, who merely grinned devilishly. \u201cBut she\u2019s only what? Sixteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen in mortal years,\u201d Luc answered. Then he grinned wickedly and tossed his sister a glance. \u201cShe\u2019s more lethal than Phin and me put together. She can handle herself.\u201d</p><p>I blew out a slow breath. \u201cYeah, okay,\u201d I muttered, then gave Preacher a glance. \u201cSo there\u2019s nothing we can do to help Seth now? Tonight? I\u2019m seriously supposed to just . . . carry on like none of this is happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, girl,\u201d Preacher said, and I could see in his dark eyes how much he hated saying those words to me. \u201cFor now you do nothing. He\u2019s safe for da time being. We get dos wudus out da way, and den we git Seth to Da Island.\u201d He put his arm around me. \u201cNow, let\u2019s go. We\u2019ll make it right. I promise.\u201d He looked at Gilles; they had a small conversation in French of which I recognized no words, they shook hands, and we left the House of Dupr\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cI really like your inks,\u201d said Josie, suddenly right beside me. She studied my dragons, checked out my wing, and nodded approvingly. \u201cCool.\u201d If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d think she was any other ordinary, impressionable teenage girl.</p><p>I gave her a hesitant smile. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee ya around,\u201d Josie said with a closed-mouth smile.</p><p>I gave a nod, and along with Preacher, the other Gullah, and Eligius, who now carried a canvas duffel bag thrown over one shoulder, we left Monterey Square.</p><p>The entire way back to Factor\u2019s Walk, I was acutely aware of Eligius Dupr\u00e9\u2019s presence, even though he casually hung back about a half block. I would be a liar if I said I wasn\u2019t affected by him; I had been since the moment I\u2019d seen him watching me through Inksomnia\u2019s window. Even now, when I think back on the incidents in which I saw him only in shadows, I was affected by him. And no matter how much I replayed the entire visit to the Dupr\u00e9 House in my head, I found myself even more stunned at what I\u2019d witnessed than when I\u2019d first seen and heard it. Gilles\u2019 chilling, distorted features and deadly strength flashed across my mind, and I involuntarily shivered as a vision of those teeth ripping my throat out became all too vivid. Then I immediately tried to envision Eligius\u2019 beautiful face doing the same thing. Don\u2019t think for a second that I\u2019m a fool\u2014I knew full well he was just as dangerous, if not more so, than Gilles and the others, despite his boyish, charming looks. It was just . . . freaky to see in my head. And Seth\u2014God, no way could I imagine it. I still couldn\u2019t believe this was all real: quickening, strigoi , Romanian folklore, the Kindred. Was it actually happening? And despite Eligius being the most lethal, he also somehow possessed the most control. It didn\u2019t make sense. None of it did, and the entire walk back I spent trying to rationalize everything that had just happened. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Beneath the lamp separating my shop from Da Plat Eye, Preacher stopped and grasped my hands. He was one of the few people who could do so without my reacting badly. \u201cYou did good back dere, girl. Only opened dat mouth a couple of times.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI know dis is a lot for you to take into your heart, but you got to do it. You got to do everything dey says to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d I said, inclining my head to Eligius, who stood a few feet behind us. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d I\u2019d already decided to sleep in my heavy wool scarf. Behind me, Eligius chuckled\u2014at least I thought he did. I shot him a look over my shoulder, and he didn\u2019t even appear to be paying us any attention.</p><p>\u201cYou do what dat boy says to do, Riley Poe. He will do you right. And his brodders will watch out for Nyxinnia.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to tell her?\u201d I asked, and again, the deathly silence of the night stunned me.</p><p>\u201cYou tell her dat brodder of yours got into some bad magic, and de Gullah, dey gonna fix him up. Dat\u2019s all you gotta say.\u201d He glanced toward the darkened skies, then back at me. \u201cIt don\u2019t feel right out here, Riley Poe. You git inside and stay. And you be nice to dat Dupr\u00e9 boy. I would not let him in your house if I thought he would do something bad. He won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Emotions washed over me, and I threw my arms around Preacher\u2019s neck and hugged him tightly. \u201cIs all this really happening?\u201d I muttered against the collar of his shirt as I inhaled the odd, sweet mixture of Downy and hoodoo herbs. \u201cIs it real? Is my baby brother going to turn into one of them?\u201d I fought a sob that stuck in my already burning throat. I didn\u2019t cry often, but when I did, it was torrential\u2014and no one ever knew it happened, because I did it in private. I felt a big one coming on now.</p><p>Preacher\u2019s big hands patted my back. \u201cAwe, baby, we gonna make things right after all, so dat doesn\u2019t happen. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>I pulled back and breathed. \u201cWhat about you and Estelle?\u201d</p> <p>Preacher chuckled. \u201cDat old crazy woman and me, we fine, Riley Poe. Handled things a lot worse dan vampires, dat\u2019s right. But dos Dupr\u00e9s ain\u2019t like dat, right?\u201d He turned me toward my door and shoved gently. \u201cNow, go git some rest. But come git your tea in de morning; don\u2019t forget dat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014I won\u2019t.\u201d I stood there beneath my door light and watched Preacher make his way to the back entrance of Da Plat Eye, step through the door, and close it behind him, leaving me alone with Eligius. I looked at him standing there, duffel slung over one shoulder, his dark hair carelessly falling over his eyes as he watched me from the shadows. It thrilled me and freaked me out at the same time. \u201cCome on in,\u201d I invited, then turned, stuck the key in the lock, and opened the door. The moment I hit the light switch, he was at my side, and despite being overwrought with sick worry over my brother, my skin heated at his closeness. I was immediately on the defensive. \u201cBack off,\u201d I said. I gave him a warning look and moved to the steps. He followed, closed the door, and locked it. And it was at that moment that Chaz came hauling ass into the foyer from the front of the shop, barking his head off, fur at his scruff standing on end.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, Chaz, stop it!\u201d I said sharply, and he came to a halt but stood rigid, head down, a low growl rumbling from deep in his throat as he stared hard at Eligius. It reminded me of his reaction to Seth over the past week. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like . . . strangers,\u201d I said, although I\u2019d meant vampires. I wasn\u2019t ready to hear the word come out of my mouth yet; it sounded nearly as stupid as zombies, although I was starting to believe in them, too. \u201cChaz! Down!\u201d I commanded, pointing at the floor.</p><p>Eligius turned sideways in the narrow foyer and squeezed by me, our bodies inches apart, keeping his hooded gaze trained on me. \u201cHe\u2019ll get used to me, too,\u201d he said, and drew closer to my bristled dog. Gently, he eased his duffel to the floor and squatted before Chaz, speaking softly in French. Within seconds, Chaz\u2019s fur settled, his backside wagged, and he whined as one paw lifted and rested on Eligius\u2019 knee. At once I was impressed . . . and betrayed. I grabbed Chaz\u2019s leash from the wall and slapped my thigh. \u201cCome on, boy; let\u2019s go for a walk.\u201d Chaz hurried to me and licked my knee. \u201cThat\u2019s better, you traitor,\u201d I said, and scrubbed the space between his fuzzy ears. I glanced at Eligius, who was still squatted down. \u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>He instantly rose and was at the door beside me. \u201cYou go, I go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I mumbled. I unlocked the door and headed back out into the night. I kept a wary eye on Eligius while Chaz inspected the grass, and finally, I caved. \u201cSo what\u2019d you say to him?\u201d From the river, a tugboat blasted its horn, someone on the walk cheered, and I could vaguely hear music coming from the Boar\u2019s Head.</p> <p>Eligius shrugged and met my gaze. \u201cI promised not to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, thanks.\u201d I had a hard time swallowing past the lump in my throat, but I didn\u2019t let him see that it had bothered me. \u201cAs long as I keep drinking Preacher\u2019s anti-kill-me potion, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be a good idea,\u201d he said, and the words made me shudder.</p><p>Inside, I turned Chaz loose, hung his leash on the wall, and locked the door. As I talked to Nyx on my cell, explaining to her about Seth exactly as Preacher had advised, I watched Eligius move around in my apartment; he seemed to know just where everything was. He walked straight to Seth\u2019s room without pause, tossed his duffel on the floor, and stood there, staring at . . . something. It felt weird having him in my home, completely strange and foreign. He looked too . . . normal, in his plain white tee and faded jeans, not what you\u2019d think a vampire looked like at all. No black cape, no coffin. His complexion was flawless, all except for a small mole on his jaw, just below his left ear. Freshly shaved, even, although he had the slightest hint of stubble. Did vampires shave? It was an absurd thought. I almost talked myself out of believing in what I knew he really was. I didn\u2019t know him from freaking Adam and had only Preacher\u2019s assurance that it\u2019d be okay to have a creature of the afterlight freely wandering my apartment\u2014with me in it. It should be Seth here, and a longing ache for my brother sank deep into my stomach. He was somewhere, roaming the streets with something way worse than anything I\u2019d ever roamed with: monsters. Against my will I tried to imagine his young face distorting like Gilles\u2019; I could not. Without my permission, the vision of Seth attacking an innocent human being and sucking all of the person\u2019s blood out pushed to the front of my mind. I pushed it quickly away. It didn\u2019t seem right. All I could see was his sweet, expressive green eyes divulging every emotion he possessed. Tears stung my throat and eyes, and I hurried into the kitchen, opened the fridge, and grabbed a bottle of Guinness. I had a third of it down when I turned. Eligius was standing no less than a foot away, regarding me closely. I didn\u2019t jump\u2014I forced myself not to. With a knuckle, I wiped my mouth, and his eyes followed my movement with intense curiosity.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I didn\u2019t have Preacher\u2019s herbs?\u201d I asked, his closeness heating my skin. \u201cWhat if I just stopped taking them?\u201d</p><p>Eligius\u2019 eyes dropped to the pulse at my neck, and swear to God, his eyes glowed. \u201cYou\u2019d be dead before you could lift that bottle to your lips.\u201d</p><p>Part 5</p><p>TEMPTATIONS</p> <p>Until the day break and the shadows flee away.</p><p>\u2014Anonymous epitaph, Bonaventure Cemetery</p><p>The night dragged by painfully slowly, and I found myself constantly looking over my shoulder. I knew that if he wanted to, Eligius could kill me; part of me sincerely believed he did want to. That skepticism royally pissed me off. I didn\u2019t like my life being invaded, especially by a guy so freaking hot and lethal at the same time, he made me burn every time he got close to me. No lie. I\u2019d wanted him from the moment I\u2019d seen him through the storefront. I always was attracted to the bad boy, but this was ridiculous. I supposed he possessed some sort of mind control; it was the only reason I could think of to explain why he made me feel like I was in freaking heat. Again\u2014that pissed me off. I didn\u2019t like being out of control, especially when it came to guys. That had happened once in my life\u2014never, ever again.</p><p>My apartment is fairly spacious for a historic-district riverfront structure, but when crammed inside with a vampire, I felt like it was a dollhouse. He sat sprawled on the sofa, looking like any other ordinary dude with a remote in hand, flipping through various channels that included all forms of male interest: MTV, motor sports, extreme surfing, CSI. Yet he watched me\u2014my every move\u2014and was blatant about it. I\u2019d already had a beer and leftover lo mein, and by midnight my insides were crawling with nervous energy. I wanted to go for a run but knew without even mentioning it that if I\u2019d wanted to do that, I wouldn\u2019t do it without a chaperone. So instead of a run through the historic district, I opted to work out extra hard with the bag. I felt like hitting something, beating the holy hell out of something, and working so hard at it that my lungs caught fire. Maybe then I\u2019d be able to go to sleep and lose the horrible images in my head of Seth.</p><p>I grabbed the empty carton of lo mein off the counter, dropped it into the trash, and headed to my bedroom, Eligius\u2019 eyes following me the whole way. I ignored him and shut the bedroom door to block his penetrating stare. Kicking my boots off, I yanked my shirt over my head and pulled off my skirt, dropping both into the wicker basket in the corner, along with my socks. A shudder shocked me, and I didn\u2019t even have to turn around to know Eligius was behind me, standing in my doorway. I spared him no more than a quick glimpse over my shoulder, and yep\u2014there he was, leaned against the door-frame in a laid-back guy manner, arms crossed over his chest, head cocked, his eyes fastened directly on me, and no shame in evidence. I wore a black lace bra and black boy-short panties. It wasn\u2019t like I was naked, not that I\u2019d care about that, either. I turned back around.</p><p>\u201cI was strip-searched three times by my thirteenth birthday, so don\u2019t think for a second you\u2019re intimidating me,\u201d I said without looking at him. I pulled on a pair of tight black yoga pants that dropped below my hips, and a white ribbed tank that barely covered my breasts. \u201cYou can look, if that\u2019s what gets you off.\u201d I spread my legs in a wide stretch and dropped my head down to peer at him from between them. \u201cBut don\u2019t touch.\u201d I grabbed my ankles and pulled, extending the muscles in my hamstrings, arms, and back. Rising on my toes, I stretched my calves, then stood straight. I glanced at him. \u201cI\u2019m no part of a contract. Savvy?\u201d In the back of my brain, I knew my cockiness was a bold move; I was teasing a freaking vampire, for God\u2019s sake. Somehow, though, I just couldn\u2019t help it. Eligius provoked me, and it pissed me off that he was in my house. I moved to my iPod station, chose Breaking Benjamin\u2019s Dear Agony, selected \u201cI Will Not Bow,\u201d and cranked up the volume. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEli. Only my parents call me Eligius,\u201d he said, and I heard it inside my head.</p><p>I pulled on my gloves, watching him with wary eyes, and I didn\u2019t respond. His look was anything but wary. I felt the room close in and fill with one hundred percent intense male sexuality, and although it was tough, I turned my back and started punching the bag. After a few minutes, I sank completely into my workout; the music pounded as I kicked hard and struck fast. I didn\u2019t forget for a second that Eli was behind me or that my baby brother wasn\u2019t coming home. I hit the bag hard, as though it was the very thing responsible for it all, and I felt the shock of it vibrate through the muscles in my arms. Desperation inundated me, and I don\u2019t know how long I worked out, but by the time my lungs seized, and my muscles were on freaking fire, tears fell furiously from my eyes. Angered\u2014at myself, Eli, the Arcoses, and everyone else I could think of to blame for Seth\u2019s absence\u2014I pulled my gloves off with my teeth and threw them hard across the room. Without a word or a glance, I swore, slung open the double doors to the small balcony, and stepped out into the night. I fought not to literally break down and sob. With my hands I gripped the cool wrought iron until the skin over my knuckles pulled taut, and I squeezed my eyes tightly shut. \u201cFuck,\u201d I said between clenched teeth, astounded by the rage building inside of me. I wanted to scream, shake the iron railing loose, and throw it into the river. I leaned my head down to my shoulder and rubbed the tears off my cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better pull it together, Riley. You can\u2019t be losing it in this game and expect to win,\u201d Eli said quietly, so close I could feel him crowd me in the confined area of my balcony. At the same time his body pressed against my back; he placed an arm on either side of me, his hands next to mine on the rail, bracing himself. I reacted, my reflexes leapt, and I grabbed his arm with both hands. Had he not had vampiric strength to stop me, I would have easily flipped him over the edge of the balcony. I let go of him, heart racing wildly. He simply stood, pressed hard against me, keeping me prisoner; he was aroused, and I felt that, too. It enraged me and turned me on at the same time.</p> <p>\u201cThe monster in me is still there, just below the surface,\u201d he continued, as if my reaction hadn\u2019t fazed him at all, and his lips barely grazed the skin on the side of my neck. I shuddered, and I know he felt it. \u201cNever forget that. Even with your Gullah magic inside you, I can smell your unique blood,\u201d he said, his mouth next to my ear. He inhaled a long, deep breath. \u201cYou have no idea how much of a temptation you are to me, Riley Poe,\u201d he said, the slight French accent making his voice erotic. \u201cNo . . . idea how much control I truly have not to simply taste what rushes through your veins, with barely more than a paper-thin layer of skin to stop me.\u201d I shivered as his breath rushed over my neck.</p><p>\u201cThat and a fucking contract,\u201d I muttered, and with what strength I had, I pushed hard against him to escape; he easily turned me around, and now we were face-to-face, body to body, and panic etched into my brain. Exerting the slightest pressure, he bent me backward until I felt the cool iron handrail press against my back. I felt every hard ridge and muscle Eli possessed pressing into me. And I mean every one. His eyes searched mine, then dropped to my mouth, where they lingered. \u201cVampiric cravings aren\u2019t the only ones I possess, but they\u2019re the only ones I can halfway control,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve still got the sex drive of a healthy, hot-blooded twenty-five-year-old guy, heightened times a hundred by what I am.\u201d He dropped his head close, his lips a breath away. \u201cDon\u2019t tease me again, Riley, unless you mean it. I can\u2019t promise that kind of control.\u201d He lifted his head and stared, his eyes dark as he searched mine. \u201cI don\u2019t think you could handle me.\u201d</p><p>Desire and fury raged within me, such a lethal combination that I thought I\u2019d come if he pressed his crotch against mine just a little harder, held it there a little longer. I wanted him, and I hated myself for it\u2014especially knowing he was just effing with me. \u201cGet off of me,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cNow.\u201d Prick.</p><p>The corner of his mouth lifted slightly, and he moved away from me. I pushed past him on shaky legs and waited for him to clear the balcony; then I shut and locked the doors. I started for the bathroom, but his next words stopped me. I didn\u2019t look at him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got three weeks, and despite what your brother\u2019s becoming, the desire to return to what\u2019s familiar to him is strong. His transformation grows every day as the quickening progresses\u2014get it? Once the cycle is complete, and he makes his first kill\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I nearly choked at his blatant honesty, and I looked at him over my shoulder and interrupted his chilling words. \u201cOkay\u2014I get it. And I promise you\u2014all abilities I possess to fight and save my brother, I\u2019ll use, without hesitation. I might not be a vampire, but I\u2019m as strong as hell, and I don\u2019t scare easy. I want him home, here, with me. I want Seth back, no matter what it takes.\u201d My voice cracked, and I stuck out my chin. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll goddamn get him.\u201d</p><p>Eli watched me for several seconds, as though trying to determine whether I was bullshitting or for real. He decided. \u201cI believe you,\u201d he said, and I could have sworn I heard admiration in his voice.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now, can I pee and shower without you watching?\u201d I said.</p><p>With his fingers he shoved his long bangs out of his eyes. \u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d He gave a slight grin.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cGood. Stay out of my personal belongings. When I\u2019m done, we need to talk. There are things I\u2019ve got to know, and ground rules that need to be set. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>He gave a nod but didn\u2019t budge from where he stood. \u201cAgreed.\u201d</p> <p>Rolling my eyes in part frustration because it looked like he was going to stand in my bedroom until I finished, I headed to the bathroom and shut the door. The water was freezing, but I needed it\u2014dammit, I\u2019d never before had a reaction to a guy like the one I\u2019d had with Eli. To think with a clear head, and to be able to look him in the eye during a serious ground-rule-making discussion without screwing his brains out in my mind\u2014that was what had to happen. That was what would happen. How could I have such a reaction to a guy who didn\u2019t even have a freaking pulse? I wasn\u2019t even sure I\u2019d make it through the night alive. With my teeth chattering, I hurried through my shower and was seriously grateful I\u2019d spent the cash for laser hair removal on my legs, bikini and pubic area, and underarms; I couldn\u2019t afford razor nicks at this point.</p><p>Finished, I twisted my wet hair in a towel and wrapped another around me. When I walked out of the bathroom, I saw that Eli had left the room. I was only mildly disappointed. After digging in my dresser, I pulled on a pair of cotton sleep pants and a black tank, and went to find my keeper. I found him flipping channels, once more sprawled on the sofa. I safely kept my distance, parking in the overstuffed chair kitty-corner from him. The TV screen had Channel 11 News on, and I stopped in my tracks as another murder report was broadcast. A woman, late twenties, had last been seen leaving the SCAD campus at eleven the night before. Her body had just been found crammed between two parking meters on East Bay. I watched as another black plastic body bag was loaded into the coroner\u2019s van. The screen went black, and Eli tossed the remote onto the cushion beside him. He regarded me just as thoroughly as I regarded him. Finally, he rubbed his jaw. \u201cGround rules?\u201d he said.</p><p>I inclined my head to the TV. \u201cThose murders,\u201d I began. \u201cThey\u2019re not . . . normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I tried to get the visions of dead bodies out of my head, pulled up my knees, and locked my arms around them. Time to change the subject, because if I dwelled on it, my mind would never settle down. \u201cOkay. Ground rules,\u201d I said, and locked gazes with Eli. \u201cI pee alone and I shower alone. Some things need to remain a mystery, and those are two I firmly believe in.\u201d</p><p>Eli looked amused, but he gave a nod. \u201cAgreed. Next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t interfere with my business at Inksomnia\u2014no matter how crude and rude some of my clients might seem. Trust me\u2014I can handle myself, and I\u2019ve done it for some time without your help. It\u2019s my livelihood, how I plan on putting Seth through college.\u201d</p><p>This time, he didn\u2019t look so amused, if I was reading the hard stare correctly. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d he said.</p> <p>I gave a nod. \u201cGood.\u201d I shifted in my seat, and I admit\u2014I was tired. Drained. But I turned my full attention to Eli. \u201cThere are things I need to know,\u201d I said.</p><p>His eyes never left mine. \u201cAnd there are things I want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe first,\u201d I claimed, and thought about it. I knew I couldn\u2019t find out everything in one night\u2014I had to eventually get to sleep. Eli nodded in agreement, and I thought for several seconds. \u201cAbout the contract,\u201d I started.\u201cYour father said the Gullah provided necessities in exchange for guardianship. What . . . necessities?\u201d</p><p>Eli rose and walked to the window facing the water-front. He stood, staring out into the night. \u201cWhen my family and I first arrived from Paris, we were . . . wild, newlings, completely out of control.\u201d He turned to me. \u201cFresh, young vampires, and we were ravenous. We killed . . . many.\u201d He kept his eyes trained on me. \u201cA lot of the yellow fever victims weren\u2019t really yellow fever victims, if you know what I mean. Until the contract with the Gullah. Not all Gullah, mind you\u2014just Preacher\u2019s kinsmen. Those days were primitive; they supplied willing donors, and we took only what we needed to remain alive.\u201d</p><p>Chills ran through my body at the thought of Eli and his family sucking blood from the necks of willing donors . I stared back. \u201cSo, what\u2014they just lined up, like at a soup kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd none of the Gullah transformed?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Eli pushed the curtains aside and glanced out the window. \u201cNo. They have to drink our blood to transform.\u201d</p><p>I froze. \u201cYou mean Seth drank the blood of one of those freaks?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>My insides hurt at the thought. \u201cHow did they make him do that? And when?\u201d</p><p>Something outside must have had Eli\u2019s attention; he continued to stare out of the window while he explained. \u201cAt the grave, Seth and his friends disturbed a vase containing the Gullah magic that kept the Arcoses entombed, mummified. Like I said, a hundred years ago things were a hell of a lot more primitive and not as effective as our methods today. Back then, once the magic was placed, it stayed as placed . . . for as long as it lasts. There\u2019s no changing it.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cI can only imagine that Valerian and Victorian fed as soon as they gained enough strength, then beckoned their rescuers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe woman found dead in the park?\u201d I stated, already knowing the answer.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>My insides grew icy cold as I thought of the woman found at Daffin Park, and I slowly rose. \u201cAnd the guy in the alley?\u201d</p><p>Eli nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I drew a deep breath. I also recalled that first morning, when I\u2019d found Seth asleep and his window wide-open. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they kill Seth?\u201d</p> <p>Eli shrugged. \u201cThe Arcoses are weak. They need help subduing victims until they\u2019re fully restored.\u201d</p><p>I stared, speechless as that information sunk in. \u201cYou mean my little brother is luring innocent people to their deaths?\u201d Yanking the towel from my head, I shook the tangles in my wet hair with my fingers until it hung limp, nearly to my waist. I threw the towel down. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better believe it,\u201d Eli said harshly, and drew closer. \u201cA vampire, even in its weakest form, can manipulate a mortal\u2019s mind and make him do anything they wish.\u201d</p><p>We stood now, face-to-face, and yeah\u2014I thought about how easily Eli could manipulate me. But this wasn\u2019t about me. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we out looking for them now? Why can\u2019t we just bring them in, and take them somewhere safe? Why can\u2019t we just kill the Arcoses?\u201d Desperate panic began to seize me again, and I didn\u2019t know how to control it. \u201cWhy do we have to wait?\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s hands grasped my shoulders hard, and I noticed for the first time that his skin was surprisingly warm. \u201cI\u2019m going to say this one last time, and you\u2019d better let it sink into that thick skull. While the Arcoses\u2019 physical beings are weak, their minds are as strong as ever. They can\u2019t know we\u2019re looking for them, or Seth and his friends. They could command them to do things you wouldn\u2019t want to imagine\u2014and with just a single, solitary thought. They wouldn\u2019t even have to be in the same room with them.\u201d His eyes bored into mine. \u201cThey would do some messed-up shit and do it just because the Arcoses said to do it. Probably already have.\u201d</p><p>My mind reeled with every horrible thing a human being could do to another, and I felt sick at the images. \u201cThen what the hell do we do?\u201d I asked, looking into the clearest pair of light blue eyes I\u2019d ever seen. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe watch, and we wait. Right now, Valerian and Victorian are too weak to move stealthily through the city. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve got Seth and his friends.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened, getting more pissed by the second. \u201cWe wait and do nothing?\u201d</p><p>The look on Eli\u2019s face reeked of irritation. \u201cNo. We wait; we watch. We try to defuse as many situations as possible. They cannot be destroyed until their physical bodies are fully restored.\u201d He looked hard at me. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they know you\u2019re here?\u201d I asked, and pulled away as thousands of worries and questions stormed my brain. \u201cDo they know of the contract?\u201d</p><p>Eli crossed his arms over his chest and stood, legs braced wide. \u201cThe contract was made after they were entombed, and Gullah magic has been in our system for nearly two centuries. They may suspect we\u2019re here, but they can\u2019t detect it. Our scent is masked\u2014just like yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan they recognize you? Like, do they know what you physically look like?\u201d I asked.</p><p>For the first time in our heated, serious conversation, Eli\u2019s expression lightened. \u201cThey know what we looked like in 1848. Together, as a family, they\u2019d probably recognize us as the Dupr\u00e9s. Maybe. My mother and father look very much the same. But each of us in a crowd, or walking down the street?\u201d He scrubbed his chin and shook his head. \u201cNo. Me, my brothers, and sister\u2014we\u2019ve evolved with the times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven that you probably used to wear . . . velvet bloomers, lace, high heels, and a ponytail, yeah\u2014I guess you have changed a little,\u201d I said, and gave a slight smile in hopes of easing the depressing mood. He must have been putting the mind-whammy on me; I was even beginning to feel somewhat better.</p> <p>Eli actually grinned. \u201cThat look was hot back then.\u201d He held his arms out. \u201cVelvet coat with tails to match. Yeah, ruffles, too. I was badass.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled, although I didn\u2019t feel the joy of it go past my face. \u201cYeah, whatever. Wicked hot, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve no idea.\u201d</p><p>I studied Eligius Dupr\u00e9 and, again, had the hardest time seeing him as anything other than what faced me now: a hot guy with a hotter temper. A vision of his father\u2019s frightening features flashed in my mind, and I tried to put the same horribleness to Eli. It didn\u2019t work. I knew eventually I would have to see it for myself to believe it. Right now? Hell no. Even I could handle only so much at one time. Other than going on just his word, I couldn\u2019t imagine him killing. In my gut, though, I knew just how wrong an assumption that truly was.</p><p>I looked at him. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>He stared back. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get your essentials in what way?\u201d I had to ask; no way were the Gullah still forming a soup kitchen for their blood.</p><p>A smile pulled his mouth, showing beautiful, straight white teeth. \u201cThe members of Preacher\u2019s community are still our donors, Riley, but like us, their methods have moved with the times. They have their own Red Cross, if you know what I mean. The blood comes packaged, and premixed with hoodoo magic.\u201d His smile widened. \u201cAnd only God knows what else. And yeah,\u201d he said, meeting my gaze, \u201cwe pour it in a glass and drink it.\u201d</p><p>I gave myself a quick reminder to think V8 if I ever watched him drink. Another thousand questions hit my brain at once, and yet my body screamed to get some sleep. I glanced at the clock hanging above the small stone fireplace\u2014almost two in the morning. \u201cI\u2019m in overload,\u201d I mumbled, then glanced at Eli. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get some sleep or I\u2019ll be worthless tomorrow.\u201d Reaching down, I picked the damp towel up off the floor. \u201cDo you sleep at all?\u201d He looked refreshed and ready to go.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like in the movies, only not all day long.\u201d Again, he smiled. \u201cJust a couple of hours, and it\u2019s when the sun is at its highest.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cIs that the same for the Arcoses? Seth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Our genetic makeup is different, and a lot of it\u2019s altered because of the hoodoo. The Arcoses will sleep from sunup to sundown, every day. Seth and the others aren\u2019t fully transformed; they might wake up, and they might show up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I moved toward my bedroom. \u201cDo you eat?\u201d I asked, glancing over my shoulder. \u201cOther than your . . . Red Cross donations, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I eat. It\u2019s strictly for pleasure, though. We get no nutrients out of it, or feeling of fullness.\u201d</p><p>Stifling a yawn, I motioned to the kitchen with my hand and continued down the hall to my room. At my door I stopped and looked out at him. \u201cDo I have to bolt my door?\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s stare pinned me to the floor, and I was once again reminded that I didn\u2019t see a third of what he really was. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t do any good.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him for a few seconds. \u201cDon\u2019t piss me off.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it. Get some sleep. You\u2019re gonna need it.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, I left Eli, brushed my teeth, pulled my hair into a high ponytail, and climbed into bed. In the dark I lay there, my eyes fixed on the beam of light from a streetlamp on River Street streaming in through the French doors of the balcony. Despite how exhausted I was, I knew I\u2019d not find sleep very fast; there were things my brain refused to accept with such little explanation, and vampires were one of them. That one was parked in my living room watching NCIS was inconceivable. Yet . . . it was true. I believed it. Without having seen any proof other than, well, Gilles\u2019 face totally contorting into something out of a friggin\u2019 nightmare, his children and wife moving so fast that my eyes couldn\u2019t follow, and Eli\u2019s impossible strength.</p><p>Okay, I take it back. I guess all that was proof enough. It was weird, and for me to think that was something. I\u2019d spent the last seven years under the influence of dark African magic; weird and unusual weren\u2019t strangers to me. But when something like this happened\u2014like what happened with Seth\u2014hit so close to home, its in-your-face reality. My brother was\u2014God, I hated to even think about what he might be doing this very minute, what he was going through\u2014and I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if he even knew he was going through it. Tears welled in my eyes when I thought about the last time we spoke, saw each other\u2014minus the incident in my bedroom. He\u2019d been so cold and disjointed, so . . . not Seth. Yeah, Preacher might slap old newsprint all over his walls to keep the wudus busy, but he was an herbalist and conjurer, first and foremost. He\u2019d brought me to the Dupr\u00e9 House because it\u2019d been a last resort. He and Estelle had never forced their beliefs on Seth and me; they\u2019d simply offered explanation and left it up to us to do the believing or disbelieving. And you can bet your sweet ass I now believed it all. In three weeks, my little brother could turn into a vicious killer.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going let that happen.</p><p>With an exasperated sigh, I turned onto my side, punched the pillow, and tried to settle down. Somewhere below, in the street, two loudmouths were laughing it up and talking trash\u2014one of the drawbacks of living on River Street, I supposed. Rolling out of bed, I moved to the dresser, grabbed my iPod, and jumped back into bed. I popped in my earbuds and ran through the selections until I found 30 Seconds to Mars. Maybe their music would help drown out not only the drunks on the river walk shouting perverted names at each other, but my constant, nonstop thoughts of what exactly was happening. Although I fought it, I finally drifted off, and a restless sleep claimed me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sometime during the night I woke from what would be the first of many dreams. In the dream I was waking from a dream. But my room wasn\u2019t my room; my apartment wasn\u2019t my apartment. I was somewhere completely different and unfamiliar, and I immediately knew it was a place where I was definitely not welcome, a total stranger. As if I inhabited some weird apocalyptic world, I lived in a derelict warehouse with rats, flaking paint, and broken windows, and when I looked outside, everything was gray, bleak, and lifeless\u2014except for me. Then I saw them\u2014vampires\u2014and at first they were on the street below, maybe eight or ten of them; young, raggedy punks. In the next second, they\u2019d leapt onto my balcony, and I stumbled back, then started to run. All through the warehouse I tried to escape, but they were all around me, leaping from the rafters overhead, toying with me, laughing; I knew then I\u2019d never outrun them, so I turned to fight. I was surprised to find a small silver blade strapped to my thigh; it hadn\u2019t been there before. Against a wall I turned, drew my weapon, and aimed. One flew toward me, face contorted into monstrous bloodlust and hatred, jaw hyperextended. It was Seth. My fingers froze on my weapon. I couldn\u2019t do it. Then the others joined him as they descended upon me, merciless and horrific, and I screamed my brother\u2019s name so hard the lining in my throat was scorched.</p><p>In the next second, a pair of iron hands shook me out of my nightmare, and when I came to my senses, Eli Dupr\u00e9\u2019s face was the first thing I recognized. In the shadows of my room his eyes were angry, illuminated; at least I thought they were. He sat on my bed, facing me. Everything was confusing to me now, and for the second time in my adult life I felt helpless and out of control. \u201cI can\u2019t stop shaking,\u201d I muttered, and was\u2014freakishly so. I was now sitting up, Eli\u2019s hands still grasping my shoulders, and I wrapped my arms tightly around my legs and pushed my forehead to my knees.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, Riley,\u201d Eli said, a bit rough, then crooned in French, and it totally changed his voice. \u201cCalme-toi.\u201d I was clueless to the meaning, and swear to God, I didn\u2019t care. The sound soothed me, and within seconds, the shaking stopped. His hands stayed on me. I wanted them there.</p> <p>\u201cI hate this,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>With a grip only slightly less ironlike than the one on my shoulder, Eli grasped my chin and made me look at him. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you\u2019re going to have to try.\u201d</p><p>Through bleary eyes I studied him. \u201cThat dream was horrible and . . . so realistic. My brother wanted to kill me; they all did\u2014like I was effing dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve no idea how potent your blood is,\u201d he said, still grasping my jaw. \u201cJust knowing it\u2019s there, masked though it may be, it is a heady temptation.\u201d</p><p>I blinked, and to be frank it was getting harder and harder to concentrate with his hand on me. \u201cAnd Gilles sent you to guard me because . . . ?\u201d I let the question hang, anxiously awaiting a decent response.</p> <p>Eli laughed softly. \u201cBecause while I\u2019m probably the most lethal of my siblings, I also have more control. And your Preacher would have no less.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, he dropped his hand, and I was completely aware of how close his body was to mine. I drew a breath and boldly met his steady gaze. \u201cI learned a long time ago not to depend on anyone\u2019s shoulder to cry on, so all this . . . consoling is very weird for me.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s eyes left mine and moved to my shoulder. Without permission, he lifted my left arm, leaned over it, and traced my dragon\u2019s lithe body from my collarbone to my index finger, inspecting it closely. My skin warmed immediately. \u201cI think you hide behind your art,\u201d he said evenly, then set my arm down and looked at me. \u201cJust because you curse, fight like a dude, and ink your skin\u201d\u2014he lifted a forefinger and traced the wing at my eye\u2014\u201cdoesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t need a shoulder.\u201d He rose. \u201cEverybody needs one of those, Riley. Even . . . us.\u201d He gave a slight smile. \u201cI think you\u2019re bullshitting. Beneath all that tough-ass exterior you really want someone to rescue you.\u201d Crossing my bedroom floor, he stopped at the door while I remained speechless. \u201cLucky for you I\u2019m not exactly busy at the moment.\u201d With a final look of victory that I wanted to smack right off of him, he left the room.</p><p>The pillow I threw landed too late; it hit the wall beside the door, and his easy chuckle sounded from the living room. Frustrated, I jumped up, retrieved my pillow, and climbed back into bed. Arrogant bastard. \u201cWhat did that mean, anyway?\u201d I hollered into the living room. \u201cThat Frenchy stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet down, painted one.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, those four words affected me. Eli might think it, maybe fully believe it. But I\u2019d never\u2014never\u2014admit that he was sort of right. Not completely right, but yeah\u2014sort of. Shoving my earbuds in, I cranked up \u201cHeads Will Roll\u201d by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and fell hard asleep.</p> <p>When next I woke, the morning sun was beaming in through the balcony door. My very first thought was Seth. And no lie, my second thought was Oh, shit\u2014I have mouthwatering, one-of-a-kind blood. Third thought? I have a hell of a hangover. Crawling from the bed, I walked into the living room and stopped short. I found Eli on the sofa, Chaz beside him with his big furry head resting in Eli\u2019s lap. Chaz saw me and didn\u2019t budge; simply wagged his hiniesca (he has no tail).</p><p>\u201cGet any sleep?\u201d Eli said, looking like he\u2019d showered and changed\u2014two things I didn\u2019t think a vampire would even bother with. He was scrubbing Chaz between the ears.</p><p>Crossing my arms over my chest, I frowned. \u201cWhat did you do to my dog?\u201d</p><p>Eli shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re friends now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I glanced at the clock. \u201cAny bodies turn up this morning?\u201d</p><p>Eli regarded me with solemn eyes. \u201cNot yet. But they won\u2019t all turn up, Riley.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cGotta get next door and back in forty minutes. My first appointment is at eleven today.\u201d</p><p>I hurried from the room, hastily brushed my teeth, and pulled on a pair of black board shorts with a small skull and crossbones, a lightweight hoodie, and flip-flops, and walked to the door. I patted my thigh. \u201cCome on, boy. Wanna go out?\u201d</p> <p>Chaz glanced up at Eli, as if asking permission. Eli inclined his head. \u201cYou heard her. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>My traitorous dog leapt from the sofa, barking. I glared at Eli as we headed downstairs. After a super-quick walk, I put Chaz back inside, fed him, and we hurried over to Preacher\u2019s. The moment we walked in, Estelle\u2019s greeting shocked me.</p><p>\u201cOh, dere\u2019s my boy!\u201d she said, completely ignoring me and rushing to Eli\u2019s side. She wrapped her arms around him and hugged tightly. He hugged her back. \u201cWhere you been, boy? I been dyin\u2019 to see you.\u201d She pulled back and looked up at him. \u201cHow long\u2019s it been? Why you stay gone so long?\u201d She shook her head and swatted him on the backside. \u201cYou shoulda come home a long time ago, Eligius Dupr\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>I watched their odd, affectionate exchange in fascination for a few moments. Eli had been gone? And all this time, he\u2019d been close to Preacher and Estelle? Weird how I\u2019d never noticed. I headed to the kitchen to sit with Preacher, and he was, as faithful as ever, waiting for me at the table, tea at the ready. We met each other\u2019s gaze as I sat, he gave a slight nod, and I started in on my first cup of tea. I poured it from a steaming pot into a mug and stared at Preacher through the mist. \u201cI look at this tea a little different than before, Preacher man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re alive because of it,\u201d he answered simply, and I knew it to be the absolute truth.</p><p>\u201cWhy have I never met him before?\u201d I asked, inclining my head to the first floor, where Estelle\u2019s high-pitched voice could still be heard gushing over Eli. \u201cOr any of them, for that matter. I mean, it\u2019s kinda hard to miss an entire vampiric family in Savannah, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe others you\u2019ve encountered before; dey jes don\u2019t make a habit of comin\u2019 into Da Plat Eye, right?\u201d</p><p>The sound of Estelle\u2019s and Eli\u2019s feet coming up the steps sounded, and Preacher looked at me. \u201cDat boy dere has been gone a few years,\u201d he said, taking a bite of bacon. \u201cTwelve. But you have to ask him why. Dat\u2019s a tale for him to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no wonder I\u2019ve never seen him around,\u201d I said. \u201cI was just a punk kid in juvy for the hundredth time when he was here last.\u201d I couldn\u2019t imagine what had taken Eli away from his family for such a long time, unless when you\u2019re immortal, twelve years was just a flash second. Maybe he wanted to travel the world, see new places. But then, how\u2019d he get his donated hoodoo-tinged blood? That thought made an involuntary chill course through my spine, and I wasn\u2019t positive I wanted the answer.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t see dem around \u2019cause dey know to stay away from you,\u201d Preacher said, looking at me over his teacup. \u201cDat blood inside you is powerful to dem\u2014like drugs, even wit our magic in dem. You don\u2019t go wavin\u2019 drugs in a junkie\u2019s face when dey\u2019re tryin\u2019 to get clean, dat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>The tea still steamed out of the spout as I poured another cup. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever tell me, Preacher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t need to know till now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Seth have it? My mom?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019d I get it?\u201d I asked, frustrated. Trying to pry information from Preacher\u2019s lips was like trying to crack open a stubborn oyster.</p><p>His wise eyes stared at me for several seconds. \u201cDon\u2019t know, Riley. Could be passed from your grandmamma or granddaddy, or their grandmammas and grandaddies. No tellin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cFigures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Preacher man, look at dis boy now, yeah? Ain\u2019t he purty?\u201d Estelle said, shuffling Eli into the kitchen and the chair next to me. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, girl\u2014he won\u2019t bite you. Will you, Eligius Dupr\u00e9?\u201d she said, then laughed and handed Eli a plate of biscuits and bacon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d Eli said politely. He looked at me and lifted a brow, then jammed a piece of bacon in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cGood\u2014\u2019cause dat would be bad, right,\u201d Estelle said and looked at me. \u201c\u2019Bout time you knew things, Riley Poe. I always kept tellin\u2019 your Preacher man, dat girl needs to know things, \u2019specially wit dat crazy blood inside ya, dat\u2019s right.\u201d She walked over and hugged me tightly, and I nearly spilled tea in my lap. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry, girl. If dere\u2019s any one body who can get your brodder back safe, it\u2019s dis boy sittin\u2019 beside you.\u201d She grabbed my face with both hands and squished my cheeks together. \u201cYou can trust him, Riley Poe. And, girl, you better eat. Your backside\u2019s gettin\u2019 bony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Estelle. Just not hungry.\u201d My gaze slid to Eli\u2019s, then to Preacher\u2019s, and back to my surrogate grandmother, who frowned. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I said, repeating Eli\u2019s words. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p> <p>She let me go. \u201cGood. Now, eat up.\u201d</p><p>I managed a piece of toast with jam, and just as we finished, Preacher turned to both of us. \u201cDos boys have gone underground, and Riley here knows dos places better dan anyone. She\u2019ll take you, but only after a day or two.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cI know you\u2019re anxious to do somethin\u2019 and you\u2019re itchin\u2019 to fight. But you gotta wait, girl. Your brodder won\u2019t long recognize you as his sister anymore, right? He might know somethin\u2019 is familiar, but not your person. If you go too early, he will know you, and dat could mess things up. You watch each odder\u2019s back, you and dis boy here, and don\u2019t go dere for long. Just long enough to get noticed by odders and dey let you back in. Dat\u2019s where dos boys will be\u2014dem bad places. Easier to bring victims back to dem bad brodders if messed up wit da drugs. Right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYes, sir, okay,\u201d I said, knowing messed up really meant fucked-up. The thought of going back underground, slipping back into a crowd I\u2019d long ago left behind, made me sick. But I\u2019d do it, and no one but me would know how it killed me to go back to the place I\u2019d worked so hard to escape. And not just the clubs; it was rarely the clubs themselves. It was just certain crowds, and I knew Preacher meant dos people. And it was in those crowds that I became mixed up with the wrong guy. It\u2019d ended way worse than just a broken heart or an overnight trip in the tank. I pushed the painful memory aside and glanced at the clock. \u201cOh, gotta run. Shop opens in a few.\u201d I kissed Preacher and Estelle good-bye, and we left.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll spend the next day or so going over changes,\u201d Eli said as we crossed the cobbles to Inksomnia\u2019s back entrance. \u201cThere are things you\u2019ll need to know and expect. I don\u2019t want you sucker punched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>Out of nowhere and all at once, a thought struck me, and it hit so hard I nearly gasped. I turned and looked Eli in the eye. \u201cA young guy was found murdered a few days ago. Nineteen years old, about to leave for Parris Island. I\u2019d inked him the day before.\u201d I knew in my heart the answer, but I asked anyway. \u201cDid Seth and his friends do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said without hesitation. \u201cBut they helped Valerian and Victorian find him, or they lured him. There are more victims, Riley. The bodies just haven\u2019t been found yet.\u201d</p><p>My stomach lurched at the thought. All I could think about was Zac, and how sweet and respectful he\u2019d been. And so ready to join the marines. Eli watched me cautiously, and I couldn\u2019t take my gaze off him. Blue eyes stared at me beneath long, thick, dark lashes, and I noticed the faint shadowy presence of scruff on his jaw and over his top lip. Skin so blemish free and creamy, any girl would be envious of it. He hardly looked like a killer, but I knew at one time he certainly was. And now my brother was one, too. \u201cI want you to tell me this is all going to be fixed,\u201d I said vehemently. I grabbed his forearms and shook hard, urging him to give me the answer I wanted to hear. Needed to hear. \u201cTell. Me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll fix it,\u201d he answered, and somehow, I believed him. There was still so much I wanted to know about him, and so many questions that plagued me. Hopefully, tonight I\u2019d learn more.</p><p>Leaving Eli in the living room with Chaz, I hurried through a shower, dried my hair, pulled my red-streaked bangs into small clips, and let the rest hang down my back. Worn, distressed jeans with a brown leather vest that left my tattooed arms exposed finished my wardrobe for the day, along with a pair of brown, slouched, heeled leather boots. I grabbed a wine red velvet choker from my dresser, tied it around my neck, and left the room, where I pulled up short and froze. Phin, Luc, and Josie Dupr\u00e9 had joined their brother in the living room, and now all four regarded me. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I asked, walked to the fridge to grab a Yoo-hoo, and gasped the moment I opened the door. The whole top shelf of my refrigerator was lined with small, plastic, yellow bags, and I knew without asking what they were. I wasn\u2019t squeamish or anything, but . . . damn\u2014that was just messed up. I grabbed my drink and quickly closed the door.</p> <p>I can\u2019t express how it felt to know that four vampires sat casually in my living room, taking turns petting my dog and watching TV. It was just . . . freaky. And I\u2019m not sure my brain would ever fully wrap around the entirety of it.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Luc and Phin said, almost at the same time.</p><p>\u201cYour tats are sick,\u201d said Josie, staring at my inked arms. She looked at Eli. \u201cCan I get one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, Josie,\u201d said Eli, and gave me a casual glance. \u201cYou intrigue them.\u201d</p><p>I really wasn\u2019t sure what exactly intrigued them. The unique aged claret running through my veins? \u201cGreat. Okay, well . . . I\u2019ve got a client in fifteen, so I have to go. You guys can help yourself to whatever.\u201d I really didn\u2019t have anything a vampire would want, I suppose\u2014except my blood\u2014but I didn\u2019t know what else to offer.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Phin said with a grin. \u201cBut we just stopped by to bring Eli his . . . breakfast.\u201d He grinned. \u201cWe\u2019ll take you up on that later, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I stay with you?\u201d Josie asked Eli, and shot me a quick glance. \u201cI want to watch her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today, squirt,\u201d said Eli. They seemed so normal, just like other brothers and sisters, that it seemed weird to think of them as vampires. I supposed no matter what, they were still siblings. \u201cBut maybe another day. And you\u2019ll have to ask Riley.\u201d He inclined his head toward me. \u201cShe\u2019s the boss.\u201d</p> <p>Josie looked at me with wide blue eyes. \u201cCould I?\u201d she asked. \u201cPlease? I won\u2019t get in the way, I swear.\u201d She nearly squirmed where she stood, dressed in a Go-Go\u2019s T-shirt, skinny jeans, and high-tops.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d I smiled. \u201cCool shirt.\u201d</p><p>Josie beamed. \u201cCool band.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight,\u201d I agreed. \u201cOkay, I seriously have to go now.\u201d</p><p>Luc looked at me and smiled. \u201cLa paix hors.\u201d</p><p>In the next breath, they were gone, and I literally heard Josie giggle just as the downstairs door closed. I would never get used to that. Eli stood, watching me, amused. \u201cHe said, \u2018Peace out.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I responded. \u201cOkay, come on.\u201d Running against the clock, I hurried downstairs, Eli and Chaz on my heels. At the bottom of the steps I turned, and Eli stood on the step above me, not quite a foot away.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I said, grasping the wooden handrail and looking up at him. \u201cYou\u2019re about to meet one of my favorite people in the entire world. She\u2019s very buoyant, optimistic, and sweet\u2014and she\u2019s my best friend. She\u2019s already freaked about Seth, so don\u2019t make it worse by staring at her all day, okay?\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s smile was subtle but effective. \u201cWhy do you think I\u2019d stare?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause you stare at me constantly,\u201d I answered.</p><p>He drew closer. \u201cAre you freaked-out?\u201d</p><p>I fought the ever-growing urge to touch him and instead glared at him. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Again, he smiled. \u201cGood. So what are we going to tell her?\u201d</p><p>I cocked my head and stared, keeping my voice down. \u201cA big fat freaking lie, that\u2019s what.\u201d I poked his chest. \u201cI can\u2019t tell her about . . . your heritage. I believe because your father proved it to me\u2014in my mind it\u2019s indisputable. Hard to grasp, but I can handle it. I\u2019m not sure if Nyx would be able to. For now you\u2019re just an apprentice hanging out for a little experience. That\u2019s it. No connection to what she witnessed with my brother. He\u2019s gone to rehab on Da Island. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Eli said, then, with his forefinger, grazed my angel wing. \u201cYou look\u201d\u2014his gaze raked over me with appreciation\u2014\u201camazing.\u201d</p><p>Why that compliment affected me, I haven\u2019t a clue. But it left me a little breathless, a little shaky, and, strangely enough, wanting a lot more. \u201cThanks,\u201d I answered, and tried to seem like it was no big thing, but Eli\u2019s smile proved he knew otherwise. I rolled my eyes, turned around, then stopped again. I regarded him. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be tempted by Nyx, are you? Because if you hurt one little hair on her head\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s safe,\u201d Eli interrupted. \u201cI\u2019ve got Gullah blood in me, too, don\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more thing,\u201d I added. \u201cNyx is a hugger. She hugs me every time she sees me. She will hug you. It\u2019s what she does. So just . . . deal with it.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s blue eyes gleamed. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>The moment I opened the door, Nyx, just flipping the OPEN sign in the storefront, turned. In total Nyx fashion, her huge blue eyes lined with heavy black liner widened. \u201cRiley! Oh my gosh, I\u2019ve been so worried! How\u2019s Seth?\u201d she asked, hurrying across the room and launching herself at me. I hugged her back as tightly as she hugged me; then she pulled back and studied me, seeking answers. \u201cIs he going to be okay? Have you heard from him today?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just her concerned questions made my heart sink; knowing the truth of what was happening to my brother, and keeping it from Nyx, hurt. It hurt like freaking hell.</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t be talking to him for a while,\u201d I said, not exactly lying. I hated lying, especially to my best friend. But in this circumstance I had no choice. She didn\u2019t need to know how much danger my brother was in, and she\u2019d never understand the truth. \u201cNot while he\u2019s in detox.\u201d</p><p>Tears came to Nyx\u2019s eyes. \u201cOh, Riley,\u201d she said, and gave me another hug. Nyx was a big hugger, and I was so not\u2014except with her and Preacher and Estelle. And Seth. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be fine; I just know it. Don\u2019t\u2014oh, hello,\u201d she said, and pulled back.</p> <p>I glanced at Eli, who\u2019d been standing in the foyer, waiting for an introduction. \u201cOh, Nyx, this is Eli. He\u2019s apprenticing and is going to be with us for a while.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cSort of a last-minute thing.\u201d</p><p>Nyx\u2019s bright red lips widened into a welcoming smile only Nyxinnia could give. She immediately hugged Eli. \u201cHi, Eli! Welcome to Inksomnia! You\u2019re going to love it here. Riley is the best artist you\u2019ll ever work with.\u201d</p><p>Eli chuckled and hugged Nyx back. \u201cSo I\u2019ve heard,\u201d he said, and gave me a quick, amused glance over her shoulder, then pulled back and looked at her. \u201cNice to meet you. Riley says great things about you.\u201d</p><p>Nyx grinned and looked at me. \u201cOh, she has? She\u2019s so sweet!\u201d Then she mouthed the word hot, and although I didn\u2019t hear Eli make a sound, I could just tell he\u2019d seen it. \u201cWell, come take a look around.\u201d She turned and headed toward the front of the shop. As always, she wore her hair in two high ponytails, and today she wore her favorite spiked collar. She grinned at him. \u201cI\u2019ll show you how we set up. First, we rock the house. I can\u2019t work without music. How \u2019bout a little Metric?\u201d</p><p>With a grin, Eli followed, and I gave him over to Nyx while I prepared for my first client and printed out the transfer I\u2019d created for her. She showed right at eleven, and after a brief chat about the design\u2014a pair of barbed dark wings, one on each shoulder blade\u2014I set to work. The design itself included intricate scrolled detailing and color on the wingtips, so I knew it\u2019d take me a handful of hours to complete. Which was fine. I needed something to take my mind off my brother, and off the vampire who was learning how to set up the Widow with my best friend. Metric\u2019s \u201cSick Muse\u201d thumped overhead, and it pulled me right into the zone.</p> <p>The early afternoon went by without a hitch, and around one thirty I sent Eli on some errands for a couple of hours. I didn\u2019t tell Nyx that his errand included going upstairs, sucking blood from a bag in my fridge like it was a Capri Sun, and sacking out on my bed, but I knew he needed it. He\u2019d watched me work on the dark wings for nearly two hours, completely intrigued\u2014or so it seemed. Nyx had enthusiastically talked Eli through every step of the dragonfly she\u2019d inked on a girl\u2019s lower back, and more than once I looked over at his dark head bent close to Nyx\u2019s work. Finally, he went upstairs. I never checked on him; I figured he\u2019d been doing his thing for nearly two centuries and didn\u2019t need my help. True to his word, after a couple of hours he returned to the shop, looking refreshed and ready to go. Good thing the Arcoses were out cold until the sun dropped.</p><p>The rest of the afternoon flew by; I\u2019d done two wicked armbands, one of which was a bike chain, which I thought was pretty cool, and was finishing up a screaming phoenix on a marine\u2019s rib cage when the shop phone rang. Nyx answered.</p><p>\u201cHey, Riley, it\u2019s for you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, could you tell them to hold just a sec?\u201d I asked. Inking the side of a marine\u2019s solid six-pack was challenging\u2014lots of hard ridges to work over\u2014and I leaned close, wiped, and inspected my work. The marine, lying on his side with his arm above his head, glanced at me and grinned. \u201cHow does it look?\u201d</p><p>I gave a nod. \u201cFreaking awesome. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d I peeled off my gloves and went to the front desk to answer the phone. \u201cInksomnia. This is Riley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m . . . sorry to bother you, Ms. Poe,\u201d said a distraught female voice. \u201cThis is Karen Parker\u2014Riggs Parker\u2019s mom.\u201d She paused. \u201cHave you seen him? He was supposed to be staying with Todd Sawyer, and, well . . . I just can\u2019t find him. It\u2019s been a few days.\u201d She paused. \u201cHe usually checks in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMrs. Parker, hi,\u201d I said. My insides froze over, and I stilled. My eyes immediately sought out Eli\u2019s, and I found he was already watching me. He moved instantly toward me, and I covered the mouthpiece and spoke softly. \u201cIt\u2019s Mrs. Parker\u2014Seth\u2019s friend\u2019s mother. He was with Seth that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me the phone,\u201d he said quietly, and I did. In a voice so faint I could barely detect it, Eli spoke to Mrs. Parker in French. I have no idea what he said. Then he hung up. As he moved away, he leaned close to my ear. \u201cI eased her mind. She\u2019ll be okay for now.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him and fully understood, although I had no idea how Eli did it. I didn\u2019t care at this point, as long as he did. I knew Riggs was with Seth, and as much of a peckerhead as he\u2019d been before, I wanted him safely returned back to normal, back to his mother and deserving a good ass kicking. God, I knew without hearing the angst in her voice that she was going through hell. \u201cThanks,\u201d I told Eli, and went back to the marine who was waiting for me. In less than twenty minutes I was finished, screaming phoenix complete and looking pretty sick, if I did say so myself. He proudly examined his new ink, the skin around the design flaming red. I gave him a sample tube of medicated ointment and tat instructions, and he left.</p><p>Nyx finished early, and she finally confessed to having a blind date. Eli helped her clean up, and as I watched my alternatively dressed best friend pick up her station with a vampire, I knew my world was unlike anyone else\u2019s. Nyx gathered her big black shoulder bag with pink skull and crossbones, gave me a hug, gave Eli a hug, and said good-bye. The only reason I wasn\u2019t apprehensive about Nyx walking the streets alone after dark now was because I knew one of the Dupr\u00e9s had her back. I felt somewhat guilty for keeping it all from her, but it had to be the best choice. It wouldn\u2019t do any good to have Nyx worried about things out of our control, and she loved Seth like a brother. I watched her through the storefront window until she disappeared down the cobbled street and into the dusky light, auburn ponytails swinging with each step.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good person,\u201d Eli said, suddenly at my side. \u201cShe has a good soul.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cShe does.\u201d Out of the corner of my eye, I looked at him, and memories of the night before, when he\u2019d crowded me on the balcony, his hard body pressed against mine, flashed to the front of my mind. I tried to decide just how unsafe Eligius Dupr\u00e9 actually was, and I couldn\u2019t. Part of me was terrified of him. The other part of me wanted to fuck him until he passed out. Or I passed out.</p><p>Eli chuckled.</p><p>And then, nearly twenty-four hours later, it hit me. I frowned and turned to fully face him. \u201cCan all of you read minds?\u201d I asked, and watched his reaction warily.</p> <p>A smug, nonchalant expression crossed his perfect features, and he shrugged. \u201cYeah, sure. And we can coerce, too.\u201d He rubbed his chin. \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet which is more to my advantage.\u201d He lifted a dark brow and stared. \u201cRight now I\u2019m thinking mind reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGround rule number three: Stay out of my head,\u201d I said, and felt only vaguely mortified at my pornographic thoughts of him.</p><p>Eli simply smirked. \u201cWhatever.\u201d He shoved a hand through his bangs and swept them to the side, then shoved his hands into the pockets of his jeans. \u201cTomorrow night we begin.\u201d He regarded me. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>Turning toward him, I boldly inspected him, from booted feet to the top of his head. I shook my own head and walked off to tidy up my station and start a list of needed supplies.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, dismayed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere with you\u201d\u2014I turned and pointed at him\u2014\u201clooking like that.\u201d</p><p>Eli glanced down at himself. \u201cWhat do you mean? What\u2019s wrong with the way I look?\u201d</p><p>With a critical eye, I studied him. \u201cDo you know where we\u2019re going to search for my brother? They\u2019re the types of places where a pretty boy who looks like he just stepped off the pages of GQ or . . . Men\u2019s Health or something sticks out like a sore thumb. You\u2019d look wicked ridiculous and draw unwanted attention. You\u2019ve got to blend, dude.\u201d</p><p>A slow grin played across his face. \u201cSo you think I\u2019m hot? GQ hot?\u201d</p><p>I ignored his arrogant, blunt question, locked the front door, and set the alarm system. \u201cCome on,\u201d I said, moving past him.</p><p>He was at the back door ahead of me, and I stopped short. All I could do was try not to look as surprised as I was.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d he asked, leaning against the frame and blocking the door.</p><p>\u201cWalgreens. A friend\u2019s house. Liquor Warehouse. Mellow Mushroom. In that order,\u201d I answered.</p><p>Eli laughed a totally guy laugh and regarded me. \u201cOkay, I won\u2019t ask. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>After quickly letting Chaz out, we locked up, jumped in the Jeep, and headed first up Bay Street, then hit Abercorn. The usual after-dark traffic crept along until we passed the intersection at Victory Drive; then the pace quickened as we moved along the oak-lined streets. The heavy brine and warm, sultry air rushed over us as we drove, and I knew he watched me\u2014could feel his gaze on every inch of my body as we passed beneath each streetlamp. At the next red light I hit the clutch, downshifted into second, then first gear, and came to a stop. I looked over at him, and shadows played over his sharp jaw, cheekbones, Adam\u2019s apple. I noticed he had absolutely perfect lips, and the way his eyes studied me with such intensity made a thrill shoot through my insides. He was the kind of guy who would have never given me the time of day in high school, but I didn\u2019t care. We sat, staring wordlessly at each other beneath the streetlights and with cars all around us, and I knew then, at that very moment, that we\u2019d have mind-blowing sex in the near\u2014very near\u2014future. It was inevitable, and I felt it clear to my bones. The tension between us was palpable, and I couldn\u2019t help but wonder just how much vampiric control he\u2019d be able to maintain. Would he lose it and kill me? At the time would I even care? The light must have turned green, because the driver of the truck behind us blew its horn, and I jumped. Eli grinned; I frowned, although it really wasn\u2019t a sincere frown, and I shifted into first and eased off the clutch. Soon we were crossing DeRenne, and Eli glanced to his right as we passed the big globe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cmy brothers and I had a pissing contest off the globe once. It was new back then, too, and Papa was furious at us.\u201d He laughed again. \u201cWe liked to think we took a leak from the top of the world.\u201d</p><p>I glanced in my rearview mirror and changed lanes, then gave him a quick, bewildered look. \u201cVampires pee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if we drink a lot of beer,\u201d he said with a grin, the wind blowing his hair all about and making him look more like a carefree young guy than an aged vampire. Why I constantly questioned myself about that, I don\u2019t know, but I did.</p> <p>As I made the long drive down Abercorn, I pushed my hair from my face and glanced at Eli. \u201cPreacher said you\u2019ve been gone for twelve years. Why?\u201d</p><p>The muscle in Eli\u2019s jaw flinched, and he stared straight ahead. \u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>Anger pushed me. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be guarding me, right? A vampire capable of killing me, staying in my house while I sleep. I have a right to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, but before I could say a word, his face grew alarmingly still. \u201cDrop it, Riley.\u201d</p> <p>I did, for the time being. After several stoplights, we pulled into Walgreens and parked. Releasing my seat belt, I hopped out, and Eli did the same. I didn\u2019t say a word as I entered the store and turned down the aisle lined with hair color, grabbed a box of L\u2019Or\u00e9al black, and checked out. Eli looked only vaguely puzzled; I\u2019d asked him to stay out of my head, but I couldn\u2019t decide whether that was something he could voluntarily do, so he may have known my plan. If I had the power to scope people\u2019s thoughts, I\u2019m not positive I could turn it off. So much temptation. So little time.</p><p>On to our next destination. I pulled into the drive of a single-story Savannah brick home just off Largo\u2014quite deceiving on the outside, since the interior was decorated in a unique decay look. I yanked the emergency brake, put the Jeep into first, and looked at my passenger\u2019s questioning gaze. I was still pissed so was short on formalities. \u201cMullet Morrison\u2019s house. I went to high school with him. He\u2019s cool,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd one badass tailor. He designs and sells one-of-a-kind Goth and urban wear online and makes a freaking killing at it. Calls it Gnaw Bone Brand. Come on.\u201d</p><p>At the door, Mullet welcomed me as he always did: enthusiastically. Despite his name, he wore a totally shaved head, a goatee, baggy shorts, a ripped camouflage shirt, and combat boots\u2014his usual attire. He was a prince.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, man\u2014my favorite hot inked chick,\u201d Mullet said, and glanced at Eli briefly. \u201cWassup, cuz?\u201d he asked me, and bumped my fist. \u201cWelcome to the kingdom of Gnaw Bone.\u201d He regarded Eli. \u201cWhat can I do you for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking for some decent stuff,\u201d I said, and inclined my head at Eli. \u201cFor him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent, excellent,\u201d Mullet said. \u201cNo offense, dude, but you could use a little darkness. Black? Ripped? Junkie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, on all three accounts,\u201d I answered. I gave Eli a short glance; then we followed Mullet inside. \u201cOh my God, Mullet\u2014how many more times can you watch Jackass?\u201d I said, glancing at his monstrous flat screen on the wall.</p><p>Mullet laughed. \u201cNever enough Jackass, I always say.\u201d He glanced at Eli. \u201cThis way, dude.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cBeen to the Panic Room lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, not in a while. Busy at work. Thinkin\u2019 about going, though,\u201d I replied, and he gave me a nod.</p><p>\u201cSweet,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll see you there.\u201d</p><p>We didn\u2019t spend much time at Mullet\u2019s\u2014didn\u2019t have to. Mullet had an entire showroom full of clothes on racks, and boots that he bought wholesale. There was so much to choose from that we had no problem picking out appropriate gear for Eli. He was silent through most of it, and I\u2019m positive he thought I\u2019d lost my mind. Two pairs of postapocalyptic urban pants, a black pair of junkie-fit jeans with side laces, two long-sleeved decayed shirts, a gray ripped shirt, and a pair of buckled black combat boots later, we left. I\u2019d also picked out a two-inch leather finger band with a sterling-silver skull in the center. Wicked cool.</p><p>I called Mellow Mushroom on the way and ordered a sausage, pepperoni, and mushroom with extra cheese, stopped off at Liquor Warehouse and grabbed a six-pack of Yuengling Lager, then picked up the pizza. Finally, we made it back to Inksomnia. Upstairs, we dumped everything onto the kitchen table, and I turned to Eli. \u201cReady for a makeover?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re the boss.\u201d</p><p>As I gathered a few things from the bathroom\u2014comb, scissors, towels\u2014I noticed more than ever how cramped I felt in the same apartment with Eligius Dupr\u00e9. I tried to ignore it, tried to ignore him as he watched me with such scrutiny. Quickly, I changed into a pair of low-rise cutoffs and an old black cotton cami, scrolled through the iPod home unit and chose Chevelle, pulled a stool from the bar into the kitchen, and inclined my head to it.</p> <p>\u201cSit,\u201d I said.</p><p>He did so wordlessly.</p><p>\u201cLose the shirt,\u201d I commanded, \u201cunless you want it stained.\u201d</p><p>Without a sound he grasped the collar behind his neck and yanked the white tee over his head, leaving a perfectly cut chest and sculpted abs bare and flawless. Quick reflexes always served me well, and I dropped the towel in his lap. \u201cOver the shoulders,\u201d I said, and with an arrogant chuckle he did as I\u2019d asked. I began his dark transformation.</p><p>With Chevelle\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Fake This\u201d thumping through the apartment, I settled into my task. Coloring Eli\u2019s hair proved to be an erotic experience. His breath brushed the bare skin of my exposed stomach as I lifted my arms to apply the dye, and gooseflesh followed. I was sure he\u2019d noticed, and positive he knew it had affected me. His hair was slick and wet and fell through my fingers as I applied the color, and as I moved around him I noticed how his hand rested casually on his crotch, and how my thigh brushed against his, or how I leaned into him to reach a certain spot. Yeah, I did it on purpose. Swear to God, I couldn\u2019t help it. He was a total turn-on; my mind and body hummed with sensations, and I knew I played with fire. Knew it, and still did it.</p><p>While we waited for the color to set, I grabbed us each a Yuengling, handed Eli one, grabbed us each a slice of pizza, then hopped onto the counter in front of him. With black dye all over his head, I regarded him as I sipped the beer. Silently, he watched me as he swallowed, his eyes moving over my body. Neither of us said anything for several moments, and that may have been even more erotic than the coloring.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you have a man?\u201d he asked, blue eyes gauging my response as he bit the pizza in half. I watched his teeth flash and wondered what else they\u2019d sunk into in times past.</p><p>Mood killer. I immediately had my guard up now. \u201cIf I need one, I find one,\u201d I said, taking a bite, chewing, and chasing it with another sip.</p><p>\u201cA permanent one,\u201d he restated. I\u2019d already known what he meant. I just wanted to provoke him.</p><p>I sat the bottle and pizza on the counter beside me and wiped my mouth with a knuckle. I lifted the hem of my cami to expose my ribs, and touched a jagged, three-inch-long scar midway up my side. \u201cReason number one,\u201d I said, and Eli\u2019s eyes followed my finger. Before I knew it, his hand shot out and, grasping my side, he used his thumb to trace the old wound. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked, his voice odd, almost . . . strained. He dropped his hand.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cThought I was in love with a psychopath,\u201d I answered. \u201cThat was my first warning never to leave him.\u201d I met Eli\u2019s hard stare. \u201cI should\u2019ve listened then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Although it was an old memory, it was still as painful as hell, and my throat burned at the thought of it. I trained my eyes on his. \u201cBecause the second warning came when I found my mother strangled and drowned in her own bathtub,\u201d I said, and shook my head, painful visions filling my mind. \u201cMy mom warned me about him and tried her best to get me to break up with him. I never dreamed he\u2019d do . . . what he did to her.\u201d I looked at Eli, who remained stonily silent. \u201cI was seventeen and was one messed-up kid. Seth was only seven.\u201d I drew in a long breath. \u201cMy mother worked for Preacher and Estelle, and they\u2019d been left by her as guardians for Seth and me. I\u2019d always wondered if she knew her life was in danger; she\u2019d made sure we\u2019d never be separated or put in foster care.\u201d I drained the rest of the bottle and tossed it in the recycle bin. \u201cI\u2019d given her hell\u2014a total fuckup and into just about everything a teenager could get into. Smoked like a freight train, toked a little Mary Jane, drank, drugs, runaway, sex\u2014you name it.\u201d I studied Eli hard. \u201cI was changed after that night, though. Seeing my mother like that?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cSomething in me snapped. Preacher saved my life, put me through detox on Da Island, the Gullah way. Then I went to college and started raising Seth here. I owe Preacher and his family everything.\u201d When I swung back around, his gaze still remained dead on me. \u201cYou know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he answered quietly. \u201cI do know.\u201d</p><p>I gave an understanding nod. I supposed he did know. The Gullah had helped Eli and his family, too\u2014in a huge way. Had molded them into something completely different from what their destiny had tried to determine. I ate the rest of my pizza and had another slice, Eli had three, and by then the timer on the oven buzzed. \u201cWell,\u201d I said, not really knowing what else to say. \u201cTime to rinse.\u201d I beckoned Eli to the sink and turned the water on warm.</p><p>With his hair on end and now totally black, he moved to the sink and bent over, resting his forearms on the counter. Moving over him, I rinsed his hair with the spray gun, moving my fingers through its wet silkiness, my breasts brushing his shoulders, until finally, the water ran clear. I applied the conditioner and rinsed again. My skin flushed hot just standing close to him. Part of me hated my easy reaction to his raw sexuality; part of me wondered whether the underlying threat of arcane danger was what turned me on. If so, I was indeed a freak to the nth degree. One thing was indisputable: I was incredibly, undeniably drawn to him. And he knew it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I struggled to sound calm and collected. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said, running my hands through his hair and squeezing out the excess water. Grabbing the towel that was half draped over his shoulders, I pulled it onto his head and scrubbed. \u201cDone. Let\u2019s have a look.\u201d</p><p>Eli straightened, grabbed onto the towel, and dried his hair, and I couldn\u2019t help watching the muscles move and flex with the motion; creamy smooth skin stretched taut over the hard ridges of his stomach and chest; his biceps bunched into rocks, shoulders broad. Long veins snaked up his arms, and wide hands moved over his head in a careless, guy manner. When he dropped the towel and looked at me, we were standing too close; I knew it and did nothing about it. Eli\u2019s new black hair hung in wet, shaggy strands over blue eyes that grew dark and dangerous as he looked down at me, and I couldn\u2019t move. He leaned a hip on the counter, braced his weight with an arm behind me, and leaned close. My heart began to race erratically, and I moved a bit closer. I felt like I\u2019d been placed under a spell, knowing in the back of my head that what I did was a bad move but unable to help myself at the same time.</p><p>\u201cYou play a dangerous game, Riley Poe,\u201d he said with steely restraint, and his gaze dropped to my exposed cleavage, then rose to my mouth, where it froze. A muscle flinched in his jaw. \u201cI suppose I\u2019m part to blame.\u201d He looked at me and moved closer, his mouth at my ear, his voice even, low. \u201cEver since I heard you say you wanted to fuck me, I haven\u2019t been able to shake you.\u201d Eli moved his entire body in front of mine, all bare chest and ripped abs trapping me against the counter, his arms now locked on either side of me. With ease, he grasped my hair behind me and pulled with just enough pressure to force my face upward to meet his gaze, then held it there. He inhaled deeply, his face inches from mine. \u201cI sensed it the first day I saw you through the window, and it\u2019s grown stronger with each encounter.\u201d He searched my eyes, his voice lethally quiet. \u201cDo you want to know why I\u2019ve been gone for twelve years, Riley?\u201d</p> <p>I could barely breathe, much less talk. Never had I been held under such a tight restraint as Eli\u2019s penetrating gaze. \u201cYes,\u201d I finally said, forcing my voice to be strong and wondering why the hell he was torturing me. He was so close that his warm breath brushed my neck, my chest, making me thrilled and shivery at the same time.</p><p>\u201cBecause I lost control,\u201d he warned, emphasizing each word as a low, painful growl, his breathing becoming more ragged. I could feel the air snap between us with a mixture of sexual tension and tightly reigned rage as he struggled. \u201cSo stop twitching your tight little ass in front of me,\u201d he said, and let his gaze drop to my breasts once more. His stare lifted and bored into me. \u201cYou\u2019re a greater temptation to me than your mortal mind could possibly grasp.\u201d He let my hair go. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be able to stop with you.\u201d He pushed off the counter but kept his eyes trained on mine. \u201cThere\u2019s too much at stake here to risk that.\u201d</p><p>My heart was beating so hard and fast, it hurt; my breathing burned my lungs. Inside, I shook, and all I could make myself do was stare at him like some fucking mute and move past him. Rejection in any form sucked; rejection tinged with fear sucked even more, and I wanted to escape the living room, escape Eli\u2019s scrutiny. So twisted inside that I could hear my own heartbeat, feel it beneath the thin cotton of my cami, I hurried to my bedroom. I\u2019d escape the mortification of the moment now; in the morning I\u2019d be cool; his transformation could continue. I still needed to do something to his hair, and I didn\u2019t exactly trust myself with a pair of scissors right now.</p><p>I felt his eyes on me as I disappeared up the hall, but even though rooms separated us, I could feel him still on me, his voice inside me, his breath brushing my skin, and I wanted to scream until it vanished. I wanted it all to go away\u2014the Arcoses, the Dupr\u00e9s, everything.</p><p>The moment I stepped into my bedroom, I knew nothing would ever be the same again. I stumbled to an abrupt halt as I laid eyes on my brother, standing at the now-open double doors of my balcony. Reaction to action took over, and I moved toward him. \u201cSeth!\u201d I said, my voice cracked and jagged with holes, emotion.</p> <p>The look in my brother\u2019s eyes froze me; they were feral, frigid, vacant, and terrifying at once. He looked like himself, yet didn\u2019t; he looked . . . starved. Before I could move or say another word, a gust of air blew past me, and Seth lunged viciously toward me, out of control and as fast as lightning. I hadn\u2019t even seen Eli move, but he now had Seth by the throat in a tight grasp, hanging him over the balcony\u2019s edge.</p><p>My scream reverberated off the centuries-old bricks of my bedroom.</p><p>Part 6</p><p>UNDERGROUND</p><p>Seeing my brother\u2019s body writhing in a frenzy to escape Eli\u2019s grip\u2014in an attempt to get at me\u2014ripped my heart out and terrified me at the same time. It also kicked in my adrenaline, and I reacted. As scared as I was, I hurled myself at Eli and grabbed his arm. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt him!\u201d I yelled, and pulled hard. \u201cEli, stop it!\u201d</p><p>As if in slow motion, Eli turned toward me, and his beautiful face had grossly distorted into the same elongated, unhinged-jaw, fanged creature Gilles had turned into\u2014only more frightening. I physically flinched, my insides turned frigid, and I froze at the shock of seeing Eli transform, but something snapped inside of me, and I didn\u2019t release his arm. All-white eyes with tiny pupils bored into me, almost challenging me, maybe even a little ashamed. And it was in that very instant that everything became crystal clear. If Seth and I survived, our lives would never, ever be the same.</p> <p>Over Eli\u2019s shoulder, I glimpsed my brother. Seth didn\u2019t seem to care that a vampire had him by the throat; all he wanted was to get at me, and my unique blood, which now tempted him. Seth\u2019s eyes were wild and hungry, and while his face wasn\u2019t contorted, he clawed and kicked the air as he struggled against Eli\u2019s hold. Deep in his throat, Seth made a noise that . . . didn\u2019t even sound human. Definitely not Seth. I can only explain it as desperate. If I hadn\u2019t known better, I would have thought he was on drugs, and trust me\u2014I knew the look all too well; his long, choppy bangs were sweaty, his skin pasty, his eyes rabid. If only it were drugs.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want me to let him go?\u201d Eli asked, and his voice, too, was somehow different. Darker. Edgier. Seth growled and struggled harder.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I answered angrily, and I hated saying that word more than anything. I knew it wasn\u2019t Eli\u2019s fault that Seth was in transition, but I blamed him all the same, and he obviously read my mind, because he narrowed his eyes. \u201cLeave us.\u201d</p><p>I stared first at Eli, then at Seth, and my heart ached to hold him, smack the hell out of him, and shake his lanky adolescent body until he snapped out of it. But I knew that wouldn\u2019t happen, and no amount of shaking would change anything. It killed me to obey Eli, but I did. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt him,\u201d I stated, and stared hard at Eli. He didn\u2019t agree or even acknowledge my request, but I knew by the way he looked at me that he\u2019d not hurt my brother. I turned and headed for the door, and just that fast, a gust of briny air brushed the side of my face. When I looked over my shoulder, they were both gone. Uncertainty and an agonizing pain I couldn\u2019t define washed over me and sucked every ounce of energy from my body, and my knees collapsed. I sat down right there on the floor. I wanted to run to the window, to see where Eli and Seth had gone, how they\u2019d gone; I couldn\u2019t. My insides were locked, and an inescapable feeling of helplessness overcame me. Then, the tears. The goddamn tears. I hated them, hated the weakness they represented, and hadn\u2019t allowed myself the luxury of them since the day I found my mother dead in a bathtub. By the time we\u2019d had her funeral, I was angry and the tears had dried, and I hadn\u2019t shed one more tear until last night. Fuck it. Pulling my knees up to my chest, I locked my arms tightly around them, put my head down, and cried.</p><p>How much time lapsed, I couldn\u2019t say; I must have seriously been in a haze, because when next I was conscious of my surroundings, I was in my bed. I could come up with no conclusion other than that Eli had put me there, because I didn\u2019t remember crossing the floor and climbing beneath the covers myself. The lights were out, the room shadowy, and my mind was fuzzy with cobwebs. Pushing up on my elbows, I looked around, noted the familiar stream of light coming through the French doors, and remembered everything I wished to hell wasn\u2019t really happening. I sat up and rubbed my swollen eyes.</p><p>\u201cGo back to sleep, Riley.\u201d Eli\u2019s steady voice came from a dark corner of the room. \u201cIt\u2019s early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve confused me with someone you can boss around,\u201d I answered, just as steady. \u201cSeth?\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause, and my heart leapt. But then Eli answered. \u201cSafe for now.\u201d</p> <p>My body eased at his words, and I shoved my fingers through my hair and searched the darkness. \u201cWhy are you hiding?\u201d I asked.</p><p>In the time it took me to blink, he was standing over me. The light from the French doors morphed his figure into a silhouette, his face nothing more than a black cutout. \u201cIt\u2019s called sentry, smart-ass. I\u2019m watching over you.\u201d</p><p>Carefully, I regarded his dark profile. \u201cThanks for not hurting my brother,\u201d I said, and managed to say it with some sense of strength.</p><p>Again, another pause, this one longer than the last. \u201cHad he hurt you, he wouldn\u2019t have been so lucky.\u201d</p><p>My insides shook at Eli\u2019s words. I knew he was dead serious, and while it pissed me off, it intrigued me as well, and I couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said flatly, and I knew then he\u2019d never tell me his reasons. \u201cNow, go to sleep.\u201d Still, he stood above me, next to the bed.</p><p>I sat there for a while, rebellious and determined that Eli Dupr\u00e9\u2019s self-prescribed supremacy over me would not get the better of me. Why the hell did he want me to go to sleep so badly? Apparently, I sat there too long. With my next breath he\u2019d pushed me flat back onto my pillow, his arms braced on either side of my head. Although he wasn\u2019t as hot-blooded as I was, the electricity remained, and my whole body tightened at his closeness and the tension it caused. You could feel it in what little air there was between us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of me?\u201d he asked with a steely, almost angry voice.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said just as steely. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>He moved his mouth close to my ear, and the sensation of his breath brushing my neck made me shiver. \u201cYou really should be,\u201d he said, and although he meant it as a warning, it turned me on instead. Releasing one of his hands, he moved it to my chest, and with a forefinger grazed the exposed flesh above my heart. \u201cI can hear your heart beating a mile away,\u201d he said, his voice raspy, thick. He laid his palm flat against my chest, his fingers brushing the swell of my breast. \u201cWhen it pounds harder, or faster, I can feel it inside me. It\u2019s like you\u2019re fucking everywhere\u2014inside my head, my body\u201d\u2014his hand remained against me, heavy, erotic\u2014\u201cand it\u2019s really starting to piss me off.\u201d With a sudden jerk he pushed off of me, the impact causing the air in my lungs to whoosh out as if the breath had been knocked out of me. I gasped, staring after him until his silhouette had retreated into the shadowy recesses he\u2019d emerged from. We were both silent for several moments; I couldn\u2019t even tell how much time had lapsed. I was shocked and still reeling from his intimate touch, alluring admission, and harsh action.</p> <p>\u201cThe body you saw, behind the alley? His throat and chest were ripped open because a strigoi vampire desires blood directly from the heart. So be afraid of me, Riley,\u201d he said quietly from the darkness. \u201cIt will keep us both alive.\u201d</p><p>I sat up, breathless, and became so conscious of my heavy breathing and thumping heartbeat that I tried to force both to slow. I\u2019d never been known for my shyness, or the ability to keep quiet, so I drew a few more calming breaths, then spoke. \u201cI don\u2019t scare easy,\u201d I said, and I heard Eli snort\u2014or something. \u201cBut why both of us?\u201d</p><p>Eli groaned, frustration thick in his voice. \u201cBecause if I lose control and something happens to you by my hand, the contract will be broken, and Preacher and his kinsmen will destroy me.\u201d He gave a soft laugh. \u201cAnd my father will let them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty sick contract,\u201d I said, and when Eli didn\u2019t respond, I decided to keep my mouth shut for the time being. It was already difficult enough to try to fall asleep with him in the room; the current in the air between us snapped like it was alive, and swear to God, despite his strigoi threats, I couldn\u2019t help the perverted thoughts that stormed my brain at the memory of Eli\u2019s hand on my body, his mouth so close to my skin. When he was near me like that? A relentless, seductive, feral desire surged through me, one I couldn\u2019t control, and visions of his hands touching me everywhere invaded my mind. I wanted his mouth and tongue on me; his hardness inside me; the two of us naked and slick with sweat; Eli standing and holding me as my legs wrapped around his waist while he pounded into me against the brick wall of my bedroom; and for a half second I thought I\u2019d die where I sat if I didn\u2019t get it right then. There was something else, too\u2014something deeper, something more intimate than mind-blowing, nasty sex, and it was that one thing that made my brain shift into reverse and seize. I couldn\u2019t even name it, but it scared the holy hell out of me.</p><p>In the shadows, I heard Eli\u2019s muffled groan\u2014at least I thought it was a groan. Then another sound broke the darkness, barely there, quiet, but I heard it just the same. It was skin against skin, and the only conclusion I could come to was that Eli had read my dirty thoughts and had decided to take care of business himself instead of putting us both at risk by taking me. I could have been mistaken, but I probably wasn\u2019t, and it totally turned me on. All I could do was lie there in the darkness and think about Eli. My mind filled with vivid images of his hands moving painfully slowly over my bare flesh, his tongue and lips tasting my throat, my breasts, down my abdomen, and settling between my legs in a long, erotic kiss that had me writhing with need. My hand moved without command, and the moment I touched myself, I came. I wasn\u2019t as shocked at myself as I thought I\u2019d be, having done that in the same room with the very subject behind the act. In the shadows, I felt him; I didn\u2019t hear him, but he was everywhere.</p> <p>It irritated me that sexual thoughts of Eli could push their way to the forefront of my mind even in the midst of the chaos that had become my life. Eventually, I drifted back to sleep, but it was a restless, agitated slumber that I fell rebelliously into.</p><p>The breaking dawn fell across me the next morning, and I cracked open my eyes and immediately sought out the corner where Eli had last been. He was no longer there, and I really wasn\u2019t that surprised. Sitting up, I scrubbed my eyes with my knuckles and tried to ignore the feeling of the morning after, especially frustrating since we hadn\u2019t actually had sex. Somehow, though, it had felt real enough. I pushed it from my mind, got up, and began the first day of my new life\u2014life as a rogue vampire bounty hunter. That was what I thought of myself as now. Amid the tossing and turning and turbulent sex thoughts of Eli, I\u2019d come to a shocking conclusion: I could no longer whine and cry about what was happening to my brother and me. This was no time to be a wimp. I\u2019d been a tough-ass since age nine and had grown only tougher as I\u2019d aged. I was a fighter, and now was definitely the time to fight. I wanted my brother back, and I\u2019d get him, swear to God. No matter the sacrifice. It\u2019d be worth it. The only thing I\u2019d have to learn to control was my growing desire for Eli. Anyone with a rational mind who actually believed there were vampires among mortals would probably repel the idea of sex with one. They weren\u2019t natural. They weren\u2019t living. They had no souls, and they were damned to hell. Supposedly. To be frank, I thought that nothing more than a load of horseshit. But that\u2019s just me.</p><p>With those empowering thoughts in mind, I jumped up, pulled on some ratty jeans and a T-shirt, slid into my flip-flops, brushed my teeth, and headed downstairs. Eli was standing in the storefront window looking out over River Street, Chaz at his side, and both turned when I entered the room. Chaz barked and wagged his whole back end but stayed directly by Eli. I ignored the cold shirk from my dog and reflected on my revelations. I\u2019d shed all my anxieties from the night before; I was ready to kick vampire ass, and not Eli\u2019s but the Arcoses\u2019\u2014the little pricks. It seemed Eli hadn\u2019t released quite as easily as I did. His penetrating stare shook me, and I knew\u2014knew\u2014he was still thinking of what he\u2019d seen in my mind the night before. He may be a vampire, but at the root of that monstrosity was a dude. A young, hot-blooded, horny dude.</p><p>I gave Eli a smile. \u201cFirst, gotta let Chaz out, then run next door to Preacher\u2019s, then back here to finish your makeover.\u201d I headed for the door. \u201cComing?\u201d I glanced back, but he wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>When I turned around, Eli was at the door, waiting, his hands shoved into the pockets of a pair of faded 501s. \u201cI took Chaz out earlier.\u201d</p><p>I lifted a brow, frowned at my dog, then nodded. \u201cWell, good for you. Let\u2019s go, then.\u201d I reached for the door, but he blocked it. \u201cWhat?\u201d I said, trying to keep the irritation from my voice.</p> <p>Silently, he moved aside, and we stepped out into the muggy air. The first thing I noticed was a custom chopper, parked next to my Jeep. I knew it had to be Eli\u2019s, and I inspected it. A Martin Brothers Silverback, it was titanium platinum with some pretty sick black scroll-work on the tank and fenders, a wide, fat back tire, and a narrower front one. \u201cWicked bike,\u201d I offered, and I meant it. I\u2019d always wanted one.</p><p>\u201cRide\u2019s sweet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it tonight.\u201d</p><p>I admitted only to myself that the thought of it thrilled me. At Preacher\u2019s, Estelle bustled about making breakfast, but my surrogate grandfather kept his eyes trained on Eli and me. I could tell he knew something was up. Not that anything had happened, but that there was something in the air between us, something dangerous and palpable. He ignored it, though, and we finished our breakfast and left. I couldn\u2019t help thinking the whole time, What the freak are they putting in my tea? Drinking it just wasn\u2019t the same anymore, which was a little depressing. I\u2019d loved the tea, back when I\u2019d thought it was just tea. Maybe one day, I\u2019d get used to the idea that it was now for the sake of my life, not just for the hell of it.</p><p>I made quick work of finishing Eli\u2019s makeover; I snipped his bangs to make them jagged and swept across his forehead, partially hanging over his eyes, and had him change into a pair of black junkie-fit jeans, a gray ripped shirt, and buckled combat boots. I helped him strap on the leather finger cuff and noticed that he already wore a leather band around his neck with a silver medallion. Then I walked around him, examining him thoroughly, and was pretty satisfied with the results. Almost.</p><p>I looked hard at him. \u201cYou need a piercing.\u201d</p><p>Eli raised a brow. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>Studying his face and following that raised brow, I pointed to it. \u201cRight there. Small silver hoop.\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly, Eli shrugged. \u201cWhatever you say.\u201d He glanced toward the door and inclined his head. \u201cMy brothers and sister are downstairs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess I might as well get them a key made,\u201d I muttered as I jogged down the stairs. I opened the door, and Phin, Luc, and Josie stood, waiting. \u201cCome on in,\u201d I said, and led the way upstairs. \u201cCheck out your bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Phin said, walking around Eli and ruffling his hair. \u201cGoin\u2019 dark, huh, Eligius?\u201d he said, and Luc joined in, patting Eli on the ass. \u201cNice threads,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to go where we\u2019re going to go, I suggest you get some of the same,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try the skins, but no one\u2019s touching my hair,\u201d Luc said, threading his fingers through his careless dark blond locks. \u201cHell and no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPuss,\u201d laughed Phin, then turned to me. \u201cMy hair\u2019s too short, but we\u2019ll go along with the clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiercings, too,\u201d I added, then opened a drawer in the kitchen and grabbed a notepad. \u201cHere\u2019s the name of another ink shop that does piercings,\u201d I said, scribbling the address, tearing it off the pad, and handing it to Eli. \u201cIt\u2019s on the west side, not too far from Mullet\u2019s. You remember how to get to his house?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eli gave me a wicked smile, and it made his blue eyes dance beneath the pitch-black jagged bangs. \u201cYeah, Riley. I got it.\u201d He glanced at Josie. \u201cYou stay here with her, squirt,\u201d he said. \u201cWatch her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Josie said excitedly. \u201cI brought some drawings to show you,\u201d she said to me, patting the backpack she carried. \u201cI\u2019ve got them on my laptop.\u201d</p><p>I hid my skepticism at having a fifteen-year-old vampiress watch my back, and nodded. \u201cCool. I\u2019ve got about an hour before the shop opens.\u201d I inclined my head. \u201cLet\u2019s have a look.\u201d Josie busied herself setting up her laptop, and I found Eli\u2019s gaze; he gave an approving nod.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be back in a few,\u201d he said. In less than a blink, the Dupr\u00e9 brothers had disappeared down the stairs. An accompanying roar of three motorcycle engines echoed in the alley behind Inksomnia at once, and I glanced at Josie.</p><p>\u201cBoys and their toys,\u201d she said very maturely, and I had no option but to agree and laugh.</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t that the truth,\u201d I said. For a split second I paused and thought about the Dupr\u00e9s. Even though I\u2019d seen the horror Eli could transform into, I had the hardest time picturing Phin, Luc, and Josie doing the same thing. Especially Josie. It all seemed so surreal, fantastic, and mind-boggling at once, and I wasn\u2019t positive my brain would ever fully comprehend and embrace it.</p><p>I turned my head, gasped a muffled scream, and stumbled back. Josie stood no more than two feet away, her sweet, youthful face contorted into the same unhinged-jaw, jagged-teeth terror that I\u2019d seen on Eli and Gilles. Her white eyes stared curiously at my reaction, and once she\u2019d seen it, her face immediately re-formed back to the sweet teen Josie I knew.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d she said matter-of-factly, a bit arrogant, and with a wicked little smile. \u201cNow you don\u2019t have to wonder anymore.\u201d She inclined her head to the open laptop on the counter. \u201cWanna see my pics?\u201d she said, as if she\u2019d not just completely transformed in front of me.</p> <p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d I muttered, and tried to force my racing heart to slow its pace. \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s see.\u201d I scrolled through the file and inspected Josie\u2019s art\u2014amazing, highly detailed sketches of everything from Pictish symbols to lizards and spiders to faces reflected in the infamous stain-glassed window of Notre Dame. They literally blew my mind.</p><p>\u201cWow\u2014this is your brother?\u201d Josie said from the living room.</p><p>I glanced up and noticed that she was looking at the picture I\u2019d taken of Seth from the top of Tybee Lighthouse in June. \u201cYep, that\u2019s Seth,\u201d I answered, and just hearing his name out loud made my heart heavy.</p><p>\u201cGod, he\u2019s so cute,\u201d Josie muttered, and continued to stare at it.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but grin. \u201cThese are seriously fantastic,\u201d I told her, scrolling through more drawings. \u201cDespite the fact that you\u2019re over a hundred and fifty years old, you\u2019re too young for me to hire,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I\u2019d love to commission some of your art. They\u2019d make kick-ass tats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Josie said excitedly. \u201cThat\u2019d be freaking awesome!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. Okay it with your mom and dad, first,\u201d I said, then thought how funny it was that her mom and dad were nineteenth-century vampires. \u201cListen\u2014I\u2019ve got to get ready. Help yourself to . . . whatever,\u201d I told her, and headed to my bedroom. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Josie answered.</p><p>After a quick shower, I changed into a pair of black side-laced skinny jeans, a gray T-back Inksomnia tank, and black chunky Mary Janes, and added a black lace choker. Pulling my hair back, but leaving my red-streaked bangs free, I added makeup and was ready to go.</p><p>Nyx took right to Josie, and vice versa\u2014just as I\u2019d figured. There wasn\u2019t a soul around who could refuse Nyx\u2014even if that soul was damned. I\u2019d simply told Nyx that Josie was Eli\u2019s younger sister, and after I\u2019d shown her Josie\u2019s incredible artwork, they hit it off.</p><p>It was just after noon when Eli, Phin, and Luc walked into Inksomnia, and so stunned was I by their changes that I paused in midink to stare in appreciation. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014they were totally fan-freaking-fine before. All three had the bad-boy look, reckless, faded jeans, T-shirt, boots. But now? Now they\u2019d stroll straight into the Panic Room and no one would be the wiser; they\u2019d think the Dupr\u00e9s were truly into the Goth/urban scene. I grinned. \u201cLooks like Mullet did you guys right,\u201d I said, and inspected all three. \u201cPoster boys of Gnaw Bone Brand Urban Wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet,\u201d Nyx said with approval, and I introduced around the room. Nyx hugged everyone.</p><p>Phin\u2019s already close-cut hair fit perfectly with the dark gray urban decayed pants, black ripped T-shirt, and thick-buckled boots. He walked up to me, grinned, and stuck out his tongue. \u201cOuch,\u201d I said as I checked out the new silver tongue ball. \u201cHow\u2019d that feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell ya later,\u201d he said, smirking.</p> <p>Luc, who, true to his word, hadn\u2019t changed a single strand of hair on his head, stood with his arms folded over his chest, his postapocalyptic jeans and ripped gray shirt making him look like a Panic Room regular. I peered closer and noted the small silver hoop pierced through his bottom lip and the silver balls adorning his ear lobes. I smiled and gave a nod of approval. \u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>Eli stood back, watching me with intensity as I inspected his brothers, until I turned my full attention to him. \u201cCome here,\u201d I said, and he walked closer. A small silver hoop pierced his left brow, and I admit\u2014it was dead sexy. I nodded. \u201cGood job.\u201d I ducked my head back to the tribal serpent I was inking on the shoulder of an army guy, and vaguely listened as Nyx carried on, showing the other Dupr\u00e9s the ins and outs of Inksomnia. She uploaded one of Josie\u2019s art files to our computer, then printed it out as a tattoo transfer. Josie squealed and declared that it was totally cool.</p><p>After a while, all four Dupr\u00e9s left and went upstairs for their two-hour vampire siesta. Nyx finished up early and headed out, while I inked a few more clients. Eli strolled in while I was wrapping up a barbed armband on a young woman who taught English to seventh graders. For some reason, I found that freaking hilarious. As I gave her samples of ointment and paperwork, I saw Eli watching me closely. When Gene the Raven cawed as the woman exited Inksomnia, I locked the door and flipped the sign to CLOSED. I stood staring out into the waning afternoon as tourists wearing Bermuda shorts, T-shirts, and capris bustled by, and noticed the dark clouds swirling overhead and moving in over the riverfront. Even indoors I could feel the change as something dark, ominous, settled over the city. Maybe it was because I was privy to it; maybe it was because I anticipated it. Either way, my adrenaline rushed through my body at the thought of facing unimaginable foes\u2014ones who held my brother prisoner\u2014and I couldn\u2019t help but wonder what Seth was doing at that very moment. Or even whether he knew he was Seth anymore. Eli was suddenly standing beside me, his presence heating my skin.</p><p>\u201cTonight will be the beginning,\u201d he said with an assured voice. \u201cIf you have any hesitations at all, you\u2019d better speak up.\u201d I glanced up, and at the same time, he looked down. \u201cOnce we start, there\u2019s no turning back, and things will only get harder. If they sense you, they\u2019ll hunt you. And trust me\u2014they won\u2019t stop until they have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHesitations aren\u2019t in my genetic makeup,\u201d I answered tightly, fearless, even though I was sure by they Eli meant Seth and his friends. \u201cAs long as those effers have my brother, I\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>Eli turned me around and pushed me against the wall, his hands braced on either side of my head. He appeared more . . . menacing with his black hair, pale skin, pierced brow, and darker looks. \u201cIf they ever caught a whiff of that blood running through your veins, you would not be able to stop them.\u201d He cocked his head and studied me. \u201cThey would descend upon you like a pack of hyenas. Your brother\u2019s strength and agility grows every day. Only, their stomachs aren\u2019t prepared for human blood yet\u2014and that\u2019s what saved you the other night. They have the craving, the desire\u2014but don\u2019t know how to act on it.\u201d He frowned. \u201cYet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo teach me how to protect myself,\u201d I said, sensations rippling through me as Eli crowded me against the brick wall of the shop. I knew then that my desires had become his. Knew it. They\u2019d become powerful and all consuming, forcing the edges of the spacious tattoo parlor to slam in around me. \u201cIf I can\u2019t beat them, or outrun them, teach me how to kill them.\u201d</p><p>A look of disbelief crossed Eli\u2019s features. \u201cWould you be able to ram a dagger through your brother\u2019s heart if he came after you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Sickening nausea crept up my throat at the thought of it, and I knew I\u2019d die before ever turning on Seth. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. I lifted my chin and met his gaze. \u201cBut the Arcoses I\u2019d kill. No problem.\u201d</p><p>Eli studied me for several seconds, and I waited as patiently as I could. Patience wasn\u2019t exactly a trait I\u2019d ever claimed, and the lack of it was now kicked into overdrive as Eli\u2019s body hovered so close to mine, silent, powerful, exotic. Slowly, he pushed away from me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll speak to my father,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he\u2019ll speak with Preacher.\u201d Although he\u2019d pushed away from me, he was still close, and I swallowed the desire to grab him by the collar of his already ripped shirt and yank his mouth down to mine. \u201cThere are ways for a mortal to kill a vampire, but they\u2019re old ways\u2014primitive, and not for the squeamish.\u201d He dragged a knuckle over my jaw, and I regarded him as his gaze raked over me. \u201cYou squeamish, Poe?\u201d</p><p>My body reacted without my brain\u2019s permission; I jammed my knee sharply in Eli\u2019s crotch. Although I didn\u2019t get the same reaction I\u2019d gotten dozens of times before with mortals, I was fascinated to watch as Eli\u2019s eyes dilated just a hair, and he stifled the shallowest of gasps. Balls were balls, I guessed. Still, he stood over me, and a small, wicked smile lifted the corner of his mouth. I grinned back. \u201cNot squeamish at all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nodded. \u201cDirty street fighting will buy you minimal time with a vampire,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. \u201cMore than anything, they\u2019ll be intrigued. But it won\u2019t stop them.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged and crossed my arms over my chest. \u201cSo when you say primitive, you mean wooden-stake-through-the-heart primitive?\u201d</p><p>His eyes never left mine. \u201cNo. That only works in Hollywood. In real life it\u2019s silver, and it can\u2019t just pierce the heart. It has to go all the way through it. Ultimately it\u2019s best if ripped from the chest wall, driven with silver, and burned.\u201d</p> <p>I considered that. \u201cSounds wicked disgusting, but I could do it.\u201d</p><p>Eli glanced away and gave an arrogant laugh\u2014a totally mortal guy\u2019s move, and it looked even sexier on a vampire. He glanced back at me, then out into the afterlight, and inclined his head. \u201cGo get ready. We leave in an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour? Why so early?\u201d I asked. \u201cWe don\u2019t just show up at the Panic Room at seven o\u2019clock. We have time to kill.\u201d I looked around. \u201cEver think about getting some ink?\u201d I asked, and inspected him. I admit it. I\u2019d wanted to ink him from the moment I\u2019d laid eyes on him.</p><p>Blue eyes fastened to me, studied me intently for several moments. \u201cReally? And why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>I scowled. \u201cStay. Out. Of. My. Head.\u201d</p> <p>With a slight grin, Eli looked away and shrugged. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve thought about it.\u201d He picked up a design book and thumbed through the pages. \u201cIf I decide to do it, you\u2019ll be the first to know. Now, come on.\u201d</p><p>With narrowed eyes, I frowned. \u201cAgain\u2014you\u2019ve confused me with someone who takes orders.\u201d I turned to go. \u201cBesides. That\u2019s way too early to hit the Panic Room. Learn some manners, Dupr\u00e9.\u201d Eli\u2019s silence followed me to my bedroom, where I hastily kicked my clothes off and jumped into the shower. With steaming water pelting my back, I measured exactly what I was doing, and what was about to happen, and I\u2019d be lying if I said it didn\u2019t make me a little apprehensive. Before, when I was heavy into partying and getting effed up, things just didn\u2019t matter to me. I thought I was invincible, that nothing and no one could ever hurt me. I could kick ass and was proud of it. But I\u2019d left that life. Now? I was about to dive headfirst right back into it. And the thought of seeing Seth involved in the dark stuff that happened in the back rooms of the clubs I used to hang out in? It made my stomach hurt.</p><p>The entire time I showered, I felt a presence, as though someone watched me, and thoughts of Eli crowded my mind. I peered through the clear glass doors of my shower, to the bathroom door I\u2019d left cracked open, but didn\u2019t see him. I didn\u2019t like how drawn I was to Eli; he was deadly, like holding a gun to my temple with the trigger half cocked, hoping the odds would keep it from firing. He of course knew it, too. Although I\u2019d asked him not to read my mind, he did it all the time. Actions I could mostly control; private thoughts I totally could not. So I was pretty sure he knew right now that I wanted him in the shower with me, slick, wet, and totally out of control. My better judgment kicked in, though, and I turned the shower off, wrapped a towel around my body, and climbed out. I couldn\u2019t help one last thought: How long can we resist each other? Maybe Eli could take it longer than me; he was, after all, immortal. I wasn\u2019t, and hadn\u2019t nearly the amount of resistance or control he did.</p><p>I dried my hair and left it loose, pulling various strands into tiny black clips. I left my bangs down, and they hung just to my jaw. It was the underground we faced, so the makeup I applied was a little heavier than usual, with dark liner and purple shadow that sparkled when the lights hit. Ruby lipstick and rouge made my skin look paler than it actually was, but beneath the club\u2019s black walls and strobe lights, it\u2019d prove the perfect effect. I added a pair of black webbed earrings; a black lace choker with a silver cross hanging from its center; a metallic hot pink push-up swimsuit top barely covered by a skimpy leather vest that sat about two inches above my navel; my favorite pair of second-skin leather pants, which laced up the sides; and black six-inch spike-heel ankle boots completed my Panic Room attire. I added a few black leather finger cuffs studded with silver, and a spiked wrist cuff, and was ready to go. With a quick final inspection in the full-length mirror in the corner of my bedroom, I grabbed my small black leather backpack and left the room.</p><p>\u201cOkay, ready,\u201d I said as I stepped into the living room. Eli stood at the window facing River Street, and he turned to look at me.</p><p>Alluring blue eyes slowly took in my appearance, lingering at the swell of my pushed-up breasts and skintight-leather-clad legs. Slowly, he moved toward me, and I noticed then that with six-inch heels I looked him square in the eye. I held my ground as he perused every inch of my body. I won\u2019t lie; I enjoyed it. It empowered me, because I knew I affected him, too. Good. I didn\u2019t want to be the only one on freaking fire.</p> <p>Finally, after a prolonged, silent inspection of me, Eli met my gaze, and I immediately saw raw male desire laced in those blue depths. \u201cYou,\u201d he said slowly, evocatively, \u201care hot.\u201d</p><p>I gave a little smile and a shrug. \u201cThanks.\u201d I gave Eli a quick assessment, and he looked just as mouthwatering as he had before. \u201cNot so bad yourself. Ready?\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Eli moved toward the kitchen table and grabbed a box. He handed it to me. \u201cFor you.\u201d</p><p>With brow raised, I gave him a skeptical look and took the box. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I said as I opened it.</p><p>\u201cProtection,\u201d he answered.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cThis size box could hold a lot of condoms,\u201d I said, grinning, and Eli chuckled. Once I got the flap opened, I peered inside and was surprised to see a flat black half helmet with a metallic purple tattooed butterfly painted on the side. I lifted it out and looked at Eli. \u201cCool. Thanks.\u201d I grinned and gave an approving nod. \u201cBiker chic.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged indifferently. \u201cNo problem. I already took Chaz out. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I stopped long enough to scrub the fur between Chaz\u2019s ears, and we stepped outside into the fading daylight. \u201cWhere exactly am I going to fit on that bike?\u201d I asked, knowing that Eli\u2019s Silverback had a single scooped seat. I didn\u2019t have a wide ass, but that was definitely a seat made just for one. Then I looked beneath the streetlight at his bike and noticed a single seat had been mounted on the back, and a set of foot pegs had been placed directly behind Eli\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cI had it done while we were getting pierced,\u201d he said. \u201cNo room for you on the scoop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got that,\u201d I said, and walked to the bike and inspected the seat. I gave it a tug.</p><p>Eli pulled on a solid black half helmet, I did the same, and once he\u2019d started the bike I climbed on behind him. The rumble of the engine hummed through my entire body as I settled my heeled boots onto the foot pegs; I wrapped my arms around Eli\u2019s waist, and he took off. As he pulled out of Factor\u2019s Walk, he turned left. I leaned close to him. \u201cYou\u2019re going the wrong way,\u201d I said, knowing the Panic Room was off Martin Luther King Boulevard on Williamson.</p><p>\u201cYou said we had some time to kill, right?\u201d Eli answered, and continued on his way. \u201cThere\u2019s something I want to check out first.\u201d</p><p>As we rode along President Street, then Highway 80 toward Tybee, I nearly forgot that I sat clutching a nineteenth-century vampire and we were looking for others. Eli\u2019s muscles flinched beneath my hands, and I could feel the ripped abs under his T-shirt. He seemed like an average hot guy riding a chopper; I knew he was anything but, and I found myself wishing hard that things were different, and that Eli wasn\u2019t a vampire, and that Seth wasn\u2019t becoming one. It was useless wishing and an utter waste of time, and yet I found myself constantly doing it. Pissed me off, really.</p><p>Highway 80 had its usual backed-up traffic, so it was slow going toward the island. The air was thick with pending rain; it carried that indisputable scent, and it even permeated, or enhanced, the heavy brine of the marsh. It was low tide\u2014I could tell without even seeing the water. The rotting sea life was always thicker at low tide. Cattails and oyster shoals sat visible in the river muck as we crept along.</p><p>After we crossed over the main bridge to Tybee, Eli turned into the first subdivision and down several streets before stopping at a stilted house at the end of a cul-desac. An old white caddy sat parked in the driveway. I climbed down, and Eli turned the engine off, threw his leg over the tank, sat, took off his shades, and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, and looked around. \u201cWhat\u2019re we doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something you need to know,\u201d he said, and beneath the streetlight I saw his eyes studying me.</p><p>I had no idea what to expect. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said, and waited.</p><p>\u201cRemember when you asked if any of Preacher\u2019s people had changed, way back when?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd I told you a mortal quickening couldn\u2019t occur unless they drank the blood of a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said slowly, not liking at all where this was going. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said just as slowly. \u201cThat\u2019s not completely true.\u201d</p><p>I could do nothing more than stare and wait for the rest of the explanation.</p><p>\u201cMore than just the Gullah were used, at first. If a mortal is fed upon, and too much blood is taken, they die. Plain and simple. But if they\u2019re bitten and live, they gain . . . tendencies.\u201d He gauged my reaction. \u201cVampiric tendencies.\u201d</p><p>I shifted my weight and cocked my head. \u201cAnd they include . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Eli shrugged. \u201cIt all depends on who did the biting, their genetic makeup. Excessive speed. Ability to jump high, maybe defy gravity for a while. Read thoughts. Crave raw meat.\u201d He shrugged again. \u201cThey live longer, with a slow rate of aging. They also have the ability to rapidly heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, not fully understanding. \u201cAnd are there a lot of these people still around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and considered that enlightening news. \u201cAll right. Weird, but okay. So why are we here?\u201d I inclined my head to the stilt house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNed Gillespie. Bitten in 1912, when he was fourteen years old.\u201d</p><p>I stared in disbelief. \u201cYou bit a kid?\u201d</p><p>Eli shook his head. \u201cJosie did.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cBut back then, yeah\u2014I would have. We were just learning to be humane, Riley. We couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo why are we here to see Ned Gillespie?\u201d I asked, glancing at the two-story house perched above the marsh.</p><p>\u201cHe and Josie were . . . close, I guess, until they outgrew one another,\u201d he answered. \u201cNed knows about the Arcoses\u2014can sniff a vampire thirty miles away.\u201d He climbed off the bike. \u201cI thought maybe he\u2019d heard something or . . . smelled something.\u201d He nodded toward the house. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>As we walked up the inclined drive, I glanced at Eli. \u201cIs Ned going to freak me out?\u201d I could only imagine what tendencies he might have.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Eli answered, and I took a deep breath and followed him to the door. Just as we walked under the porch light, the front door opened; there stood a young guy, mid-to late twenties, with crazy brown hair and frosted tips, a yellow and black Led Zeppelin T-shirt, and destroyed jeans. His eyes crinkled in the corners as he grinned and bumped fists with Eli.</p><p>\u201cDude, what\u2019s up? Haven\u2019t seen you in a while,\u201d he said to Eli, then looked at me. \u201cWhoa. Who\u2019s the babe?\u201d He leaned closer to Eli. \u201cIs she a bloodsucker? That\u2019s sick, man.\u201d Then his eyes landed on my dragons. \u201cDamn\u2014sweet tats.\u201d He walked around me, looking. \u201cSweet.\u201d</p> <p>Eli shook his head and laughed. \u201cNo, Ned. She\u2019s\u201d\u2014he looked at me\u2014\u201ca friend. A mortal friend.\u201d He inclined his head. \u201cNed Gillespie, Riley Poe.\u201d</p><p>Ned stuck out his hand to shake mine, and I allowed it, although I was in shock to see Ned as a young guy instead of a hundred-and-twelve-year-old. Weird. \u201cWell, Riley Poe, this is the dawning of the age of Aquarius, don\u2019t ya think? Vamps, Tendies, and mortals, chillin\u2019 together. Pretty awesome, huh?\u201d</p><p>I shot a quick glance at Eli. \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d I thought I\u2019d fallen through a time warp and straight into one of Bill and Ted\u2019s excellent adventures.</p><p>\u201cWell, come on in to my humble abode,\u201d he said. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>Eli gave me a glance and a nod, and I went inside first. It was an open floor plan, with cathedral ceilings and a walkway at the top that encircled the entire room. No sooner did Ned close the door behind us than a cell phone rang, and he patted his pockets, then cursed.</p><p>\u201cBe right back,\u201d he said, and swear to God, had I not seen it with my own two eyes, I\u2019d never have believed it\u2014even knowing what I now know about vampires, I wouldn\u2019t have believed it. In one leap Ned cleared the wooden railing of the walkway\u2014an easy twenty feet if not more. He disappeared into a room, and in the next second he was leaping down again. He looked at me as he landed.</p> <p>\u201cMissed call,\u201d he said, as if what he\u2019d done was absolutely normal.</p><p>I could do nothing more than lift my brows in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cListen, Ned,\u201d Eli said. \u201cHave you sensed any other vampires lately?\u201d</p><p>Ned dramatically lifted his nose to the air and sniffed. \u201cYeah, dude, I have. It\u2019s not strong, though\u2014so weak actually I thought it was farther up the coast. Why, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Arcoses,\u201d Eli said. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen or heard anything?\u201d</p><p>Ned looked at Eli, and seriousness replaced the carefree attitude he\u2019d just had.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a pack of them. Young, not fully transformed, but a load of trouble, if you know what I mean,\u201d Eli said, inclining his head toward me. \u201cOne of them is her brother.\u201d</p><p>Ned regarded me. \u201cThat sucks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you sensed them around here?\u201d Eli asked. \u201cOn the island?\u201d</p><p>Ned shook his head. \u201cBeen in Atlanta at a gaming convention.\u201d He glanced at me and grinned. \u201cI created Urban Bloodsuckers,\u201d he said, waiting for me to comprehend. \u201cThe computer game? You know, software? Badass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d I said, and he shrugged.</p><p>Eli and Ned exchanged few more words, and then we said good-bye, with Ned\u2019s promise that he\u2019d contact us if Seth or the others showed up on the island. I felt skeptical\u2014Ned seemed to be in his own little software world despite the superpowers having been bitten by a vampire had awarded him. \u201cLive long and prosper,\u201d Ned hollered from his front door as we climbed on the bike and left. Eli explained over his shoulder, \u201cHe\u2019s a big Trekky.\u201d I fully could see that\u2014especially since he\u2019d been around since before Captain James Kirk was even a spark in his daddy\u2019s eye.</p><p>A spitting rain had begun just as we turned off of President Street and onto Bay, and we made it to the Panic Room just before the bottom fell out. A nondescript brick building, the club was completely void of neon lights or signs; the entrance was a plain set of haint blue double doors, and if you didn\u2019t know of the Panic Room, you\u2019d never have found it on your own. It was sort of a word-of-mouth type of place, and only a select few could waltz right in. A lot of shit happened in the Panic Room\u2014drugs, sex, prostitution\u2014but the owner\u2019s attorney was a pit bull. They\u2019d already sued the city for a bust without probable cause and a warrant, and not only did the attorney rake in the dough because of it, but the incident had made the SPD extremely cautious about raiding the Panic Room again. We parked the bike along the sidewalk and hurried to the entrance.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the big guy with the braid?\u201d Eli leaned toward my ear and whispered.</p><p>I turned into his neck and was surprised by the thrill that shot through me at the intimate closeness. \u201cZetty\u2019s in his midthirties, from Tibet. He serves as the Panic Room\u2019s resident doorman.\u201d Zetty, with a black braid that reached his waist, always dressed in traditional Tibetan clothing, with a long red yak-wool wrap and black baggy pants tucked into a worn pair of shin-high leather boots. \u201cHe was once a Shiva follower,\u201d I said. \u201cSee the symbol of a god inked into his forehead?\u201d</p><p>Eli looked down at me. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Tattooed into Zetty\u2019s forehead were brightly colored squares of yellow and red adorned with dots that extended just down the bridge of his nose. He wore round, brightly colored stone earrings and carried a traditional Tibetan knife in a multicolored, handwoven sheath secured across his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him use that knife, too, so don\u2019t be stupid.\u201d No one fucked with Zetty.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Eli said, and placed his hand to my lower back and urged me forward.</p><p>Zetty smiled at me as we drew close, and recognition made his eyes shine. It was the kind of look that made his already intimidating features even scarier. \u201cRiley Poe. What are you doing here?\u201d he said in his heavy Tibetan accent, and grasped my shoulder.</p><p>Eli immediately stiffened and moved slightly in front of me, causing Zetty\u2019s gaze to move from me to Eli. Zetty frowned.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I said quietly to Eli, and placed my hand on his back. \u201cZetty\u2019s an old friend.\u201d I looked at the bouncer. \u201cJust here to hang out. So how ya been, Zetty?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cCannot complain,\u201d he answered, but his attention was now on Eli.</p><p>\u201cGood. Nice seeing ya,\u201d I said, and tugged on Eli\u2019s arm.</p><p>Zetty turned his eyes on me. \u201cStay out of the back rooms, Riley,\u201d he said with a deadpan tone. \u201cNothing there for you anymore.\u201d</p><p>We walked away, and I averted my gaze from Zetty.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with him?\u201d Eli asked as we passed through the small foyer where the music reverberated through another set of double doors that led into the club. \u201cHe seems too protective over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe probably thought the same thing about you.\u201d I smiled. \u201cZetty does his job and only his job,\u201d I said, glancing at him. \u201cHe always hated that I\u2019d gotten messed up, and while he knows what goes on in the back panic rooms, he doesn\u2019t get involved.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cExcept for once. He pulled me out of a bad situation and almost killed a guy doing it. Otherwise, he merely stays up front and keeps the peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows what I am,\u201d Eli said matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t doubt it,\u201d I answered, knowing he\u2019d read Zetty\u2019s mind, and to be honest, I wasn\u2019t all that surprised. Zetty had been sort of a mystical man in Tibet, mysterious and deadly. I was always grateful he liked me, for whatever reason.</p><p>As we pushed into the crowd, the black walls and strobe lights swallowed us, and \u201cThe Raven and the Rose\u201d by My Dying Bride slammed through the sound system and hummed through me; Eli\u2019s body crowded mine, his palm and fingers pressed possessively to the bare skin of my lower back as he guided me through a sea of smoke, black leather, silver spikes, and exotic makeup. This part of the Panic Room was tame\u2014the club part, the dancing, the music, the drinks, and most of the people. What I knew lay in the back rooms\u2014the dark panic rooms\u2014was something else altogether. I\u2019d experienced them, and I\u2019d be a liar if I said it didn\u2019t bother me to be back. And yet with Eli\u2019s hand against my skin, and the music bounding through my body, it sort of thrilled me, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d ask what\u2019s wrong, but I already know,\u201d Eli said, his mouth grazing the shell of my ear as he leaned close. I turned and looked at him, our faces close, intoxicating, erotic. His eyes were mesmerizing, and I was drawn to them. Him. I was drawn to him.</p><p>\u201cThis is the easy part,\u201d I said, and I knew he understood that I meant where we were now. \u201cKelter Phillips owns this place. I know how to get in, know how to act. And I know exactly what to do to be accepted back.\u201d Now I pushed my lips to Eli\u2019s ear. \u201cYou say the Arcoses are into the dark stuff, right? It\u2019s where they\u2019ll gather their freaky vampiric army?\u201d I purposely pressed my mouth to Eli\u2019s jaw. \u201cThen it\u2019s this place they\u2019ll come, and I swear to God, I\u2019m not leaving here tonight without finding something out about my brother or those assholes that have him under their control.\u201d I pulled back and held Eli\u2019s gaze with my very determined one. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to back off, Eli, and trust me. These aren\u2019t vampires. They\u2019re people.\u201d I lifted my chin. \u201cI can damn well handle people.\u201d He stared hard, contemplating probably, then gave a begrudging single nod, and his eyes flared as they bored into mine. I couldn\u2019t tell whether he was impressed or turned on. With his hand resting on my hip, Eli guided me to the bar; I ordered a shot of whiskey, and to my surprise Eli did the same. As I lifted the glass and swallowed the fiery liquid, Eli watched, his gaze following the path of the whiskey as it slipped down my throat. Raw male power and deliberate sexual hunger lit his eyes, and to say that the sensation it stirred within me was erotic was a freaking understatement. He was driving me crazy, and I had to literally make a conscious effort not to put my hands on him. It was so easy to submerge into the seductive darkness of our surroundings; the music, the forced intimacy, the whiskey\u2014they were all drugs in their own right. And I was an ex-junkie to it all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s coming, and I don\u2019t like him,\u201d Eli said close to me, and he turned to the bar. I waited, although I knew who it\u2019d be. I was right.</p><p>\u201cRiley Poe. Damn, it is you,\u201d a throaty voice said behind me. \u201cAll grown-up.\u201d</p><p>I turned and amid the strobe lights stared into a face from my past\u2014one I hadn\u2019t ever planned on encountering again but knew I\u2019d run into tonight. Average-sized, Kelter Phillips wore his usual attire: a collection of black leather, chains, spiked cuffs, and collars, and his signature bald head and black goatee looked exactly as they had when I used to hang with him. Ten years my senior and filthy rich, he now sported a large tat that started at his brow and stretched over his head in a six-inch-wide strip, Mohawk style. The tat was a list of the seven deadly sins, written in Old English and inked in black, with black vines and bloodred roses along the side. The words above his brow read Fuck Virtue, followed by lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy, and pride in intricate calligraphy. Damn, he always thought he was a badass. He could smell fresh meat a mile away, and to him I\u2019d always been meat\u2014only back then, I hadn\u2019t known or cared. I pushed past my revulsion and gave Kelter a seductive smile. Eli tensed beside me. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Kelter?\u201d</p> <p>Kelter gave Eli a curious glance and a nod. \u201cFriend of yours?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, a friend,\u201d I assured him. I\u2019d get nowhere fast if Kelter thought I had the scrutiny of a boyfriend, and I nearly snorted out loud when I thought of what he\u2019d think if he knew Eli was a creature of the afterlight. Beside me, Eli smothered a chuckle. Get out of my head, jackass, I thought. I knew Eli had heard.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d Kelter offered, completely ignoring Eli, and I tried not to shiver with revulsion when he placed his hand on my bare lower back.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said, looking directly into Kelter\u2019s black-lined eyes. I slid from the barstool and allowed him to guide me into the throng of people dancing. Before I got too far, I glanced over my shoulder; Eli sat watching me with a deadly glare in his eyes. I\u2019ll be okay, I told him in my mind, and allowed the crowd to swallow me up. I wasn\u2019t kidding myself; I knew Eli could see me, hear my heart, and would hear if called for him.</p><p>And God help anyone in his path.</p> <p>Megadeth\u2019s \u201cBite the Hand\u201d roared through the Panic Room, and I moved seductively to the music; strange bodies moved with me. With my peripheral, I noticed someone standing close to us, and when I turned, the person had slipped back into the crowd. I stared hard through the smoky darkness. It was Eli, and he was everywhere, moving so fast the human eye couldn\u2019t track him. I knew to look for him, and although I couldn\u2019t see him actually change locations, I glimpsed him hovering closer, like a hawk. I got one glimpse of his face; he looked like he wanted to rip Kelter apart. Take it easy, Dupr\u00e9, I said in my mind, and turned my attention back to the scumbag I was forced to deal with.</p><p>Kelter watched me intently as his hands slid down my hips and pulled me closer, and I knew he was already half lit and turned on, the smell of whiskey, marijuana, and cigarettes clinging to him. Suddenly, his hands were on my ass, his crotch grinding against me, and his mouth pressed to my ear. \u201cYou look good enough to fuck right here,\u201d he said, obviously thinking his controlling dirty talk would do it for me, and it made me sick to think that at one time, it had done it for me. Now it made me profusely sick, and I tried not to let it show. \u201cThat ink is goddamn hot,\u201d he said, and traced my dragons up both arms, then back down again. \u201cAll professional now, huh? Got your own business,\u201d he said, moving behind me and groping my hips, pulling me hard against him. His dick was already hard\u2014it probably stayed that way. With all the crap Kelter took, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me to know he\u2019d added Viagra to his repertoire of drugs and walked around with a twenty-four-hour woody. \u201cWanna go to the back?\u201d he said in my ear, and turned me back around to face him. \u201cOld times, huh, Riley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends,\u201d I said loudly over the pounding music. \u201cOn what you got back there.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, Kelter grabbed my hand and pushed it against his crotch, and he throbbed beneath the leather pants at my touch. I tried to control my reaction; seriously, I did. But a lot had happened since my wild, reckless days at the Panic Room, and I reacted. I grabbed his balls hard, yanked upward and in, and twisted; Kelter\u2019s eyes widened, and he smothered a painful gasp. I could tell he was getting no air at all if the squeaking from his throat and stretched eyeballs meant anything. I pressed my lips together to keep from laughing.</p><p>\u201cNobody forces me anymore,\u201d I said, staring deadpan at Kelter\u2019s agonized face. I squeezed harder. \u201cLike you said\u2014I\u2019m all grown-up, and I didn\u2019t come here for a lay. I don\u2019t trade shit for it anymore. I\u2019ll pay. Cash.\u201d I glared at him. \u201cUnderstand?\u201d</p><p>Kelter nodded because he couldn\u2019t breathe, and I released him. He coughed and drew a few deep breaths, and finally gave me a skeptical look. \u201cAlways did like it rough, didn\u2019t you, Poe?\u201d</p> <p>I shrugged and turned to leave. I knew he\u2019d stop me. He did.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, nearly grabbing my arm but thinking better of it. \u201cCome on.\u201d He inclined his head but didn\u2019t touch me. \u201cYou remember the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, and followed him. Weaving through the sweating bodies and haze of cigarette smoke, I made my way to the panic rooms. Behind the main floor of the club was a horseshoe-shaped, dimly lit corridor that held the bathrooms. It swung in a half circle back to the main hall, and I knew that in the back was a set of double doors that led to six small rooms\u2014rooms where crazy-weird stuff went on: sex, prostitution, drugs, fantasy role-playing\u2014just about anything. As we squeezed past the people in the corridor, I winced as memories of my old self resurfaced. Near the back, a couple made out against the wall, her short leather skirt riding up her hips as his hand disappeared between her legs. She looked over his shoulder as I passed by and gave me the slightest of smiles, just before her eyes rolled back. Turning my head, I ignored her and continued on. Another small group of people hovered close by, and one guy in particular who stood off alone didn\u2019t really surprise me: Eli. His head was bent, but as I passed he lifted it, and a hot, penetrating gaze met mine, followed by a look of pure hatred at Kelter. I got it, I mouthed to him, but it didn\u2019t change his glare. All I wanted to do was get back into the scene, or at least make Kelter think I wanted back in. Lowlifes of various ages abounded in the panic rooms\u2014but they were mostly buck-wild teens whose parents had no effing clue what they were up to, and Kelter, the sicko that he was, supplied whatever, whenever. Perfect recruits for the Arcoses. Not if I can help it . . .</p><p>Kelter stopped at the double doors, withdrew a key from his pocket, and opened the lock. He inclined his head for me to enter, and I did, and the moment I stepped through, the heavy scent of marijuana billowed out. My eyes burned as we walked down another short hall to Kelter\u2019s office. He opened the door, and in a rush, a body flew by me, slamming into me so hard that I stumbled and fell against the wall.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it!\u201d Kelter yelled. At the door, the figure stopped and turned. The figure wore dark ratty jeans and a black hoodie, and a pasty white face peered back at him. My insides froze to ice. It was Riggs Parker. And he turned directly to me and stared.</p><p>Part 7</p><p>OBSESSIONS</p><p>Riggs stared at me for several seconds, and I knew right away that he didn\u2019t recognize me. The feral gaze in his eyes reminded me of a junkie, or worse\u2014a starved animal, one who\u2019d been chained in a grass-less, dirt-covered backyard with no food, no water. It sent shivers down my spine, and just when I thought I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, he looked away and focused on Kelter. It took everything in my power not to scream, Riggs! You peckerhead! Snap out of it! I knew it would do no good.</p> <p>\u201cVal says the next time you lock me out, you\u2019re dead,\u201d Riggs said, smirking, dangling a gallon-sized ziplock filled with small, plastic-wrapped packages the size of sausage links in the air, his voice heavy, dark, menacing. A maniacal smile tainted his youthful features. He barely even looked like the Riggs I knew. \u201cWell, look at that,\u201d he said, cocking his head and scrutinizing Kelter. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re already dead, man.\u201d Without another glance my way, he turned and disappeared out the door; I pushed off the wall and ran after him.</p><p>In the corridor, I pulled up short and caught a glimpse of Riggs as he pushed out a single steel door. I took off after him. My mind was void of everything; I thought of nothing but finding Seth. The metal bar of the steel door stung my palms as I slammed into it and ran outside and into the dark, dank alley behind the Panic Room. The putrid scent of urine mixed with rain and trash from the Dumpster made me gasp for air, and at the end of the alley, beneath a streetlamp, I saw Riggs. He and several others\u2014I counted seven in all\u2014wore dark hoodies, and they paused and glanced back at me. I knew Seth was one of them, and I drew in a deep breath and yelled. \u201cSe\u2014!\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened, and I fought against the steely grip around my waist and mouth. I knew it was Eli without even looking. I watched, stunned, as Riggs and the others did something that literally blew my mind. With a series of shrill yells, extreme leaps, and acrobatic moves, running up the trunk of a tree and swinging off limbs, railings, window ledges, they dispersed to the building across the street like a freaking circus troupe. One of them picked something up from the ground and smashed it into the window of a parked car, and the night air filled with the shrill sound of an alarm, followed by adolescent laughter. Within seconds\u2014no lie, under a minute\u2014they were all on the rooftop. I held my breath because I knew one of them was my brother and they teetered dangerously close to the roof\u2019s edge. Finally, the blackness of the night swallowed them up as they leapt out of sight. If I hadn\u2019t known any better, I would have sworn they\u2019d flown.</p><p>\u201cFree running.\u201d Eli\u2019s voice spoke quietly against my ear. He released my mouth but not my waist. \u201cThey\u2019re learning fast.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been watching them all night,\u201d said Josie as she emerged from the darkness. Phin and Luc flanked her.</p><p>\u201cWicked urban freestyle,\u201d Luc said, nodding. He crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cThey\u2019re getting pretty damn good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd their quickening grows fast,\u201d Phin said, and glanced at Eli. \u201cAs does the brothers\u2019 rejuvenation. Faster than we thought.\u201d</p> <p>I moved out of Eli\u2019s grip and stared in the direction Seth had gone. \u201cMy brother can barely walk and chew gum at the same time,\u201d I said, mostly to myself, and then looked at Eli. His beautiful features were cast in half shadows, seemingly haunted, as he met my gaze. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why we have to be here. Why can\u2019t we just go after them? Take them away from the Arcoses, and let Preacher get Seth and the others to Da Island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why,\u201d Eli said quietly. \u201cWe\u2019ve already been over this. I know it\u2019s tempting to just grab them, but it\u2019d do a hell of a lot more harm than good. There are three weeks left in the moon\u2019s cycle.\u201d He put his hand on my shoulder. \u201cNo way will the Arcoses rejuvenate faster than a cycle. We\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and we can\u2019t get too close, Riley,\u201d Phin said, leaning against the wall. \u201cVictorian and Valerian are smart little bastards. They may be weak, but they\u2019re still deadly. We wait.\u201d</p><p>I considered that. \u201cBack in Kelter\u2019s office, Riggs mentioned Val being angry that Riggs had been locked out of the office. Then he took a plastic bag and ran.\u201d I looked at the Dupr\u00e9s. \u201cThe way it was packaged, it looked like pills. OxyContin probably.\u201d I rubbed my arms. \u201cYou crush it, melt it, and smoke it\u2014gives you a high like heroin.\u201d They all looked at me like I\u2019d lost my mind, but I knew what I spoke of. I\u2019d gotten the same bag from Kelter before. \u201cVal is Valerian, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Eli nodded. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s sort of the . . . leader, I guess you could say. He\u2019s the eldest of the two. Apparently he\u2019s already zeroed in on Phillips.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow has he already established a drug trade?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe Arcoses have only been free for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind control,\u201d Eli said. \u201cFrom the moment the tomb was broken both Arcos brothers had complete mind control. They can make Phillips do whatever they wish. They won\u2019t stop until their army is complete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cValerian is as mean as hell,\u201d Luc added, his face grave. \u201cNo mercy. He gets off on torture\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuc, enough,\u201d said Eli.</p><p>Pacing seemed to help, so I did it, but soon the stench of the alley made my stomach roll. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do with loverboy in there?\u201d I said, inclining my head to the back door of the Panic Room.</p><p>\u201cGo back in,\u201d Eli said. \u201cLet him think you\u2019re interested in buying, but not tonight\u2014not after what just happened. Let him think you\u2019re rattled.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat will buying drugs do to help us against the Arcoses?\u201d I asked. \u201cAnd I think after having his balls yanked into a twist, he knows I don\u2019t rattle easily.\u201d</p><p>Luc and Phin chuckled, and Eli glared at me. \u201cIt keeps us from getting kicked out. Better to watch who your brother and his friends pick up. Just do it, Riley. And we\u2019ll leave by the front entrance. You don\u2019t want that big Tibetan on your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want access to their supplier,\u201d Phin added. \u201cAnd to the rooms. It\u2019s apparent that Valerian has your brother and his friends using this place. Not just to gather more kids for his army, but probably to lure victims.\u201d My stomach sank at that last part.</p><p>\u201cDid Seth\u2019s friend recognize you?\u201d asked Josie, who\u2019d been quietly watching.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I answered. \u201cHe stared at me for a few seconds like I was a pork chop, but that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Luc and Phin chuckled; Eli did not. He just stared at me, angry, and I couldn\u2019t understand why he was so pissed off at me.</p><p>\u201cOkay, guys, let\u2019s go,\u201d said Josie, and headed up the alley toward the street. She glanced over her shoulder, then stopped and looked directly at me. \u201cBye, Riley. Don\u2019t worry\u2014we\u2019ll keep an eye on Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeace out,\u201d Luc said, following her, and Phin grinned and hurried up the alleyway. I watched in awe as the Dupr\u00e9 siblings mimicked Seth\u2019s and Riggs\u2019 free-running moves, using every ledge and flat surface to spring effortlessly off of\u2014and at a much faster pace than Seth and the others had. At the rooftop of the building across the street, Josie stopped, turned, and waved, and then the three disappeared into the darkness.</p> <p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Eli said, his voice angry, edgy. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with and get out of here. Place makes me sick.\u201d He opened the door and held it for me, and I held his gaze as I walked through. I didn\u2019t look back as I walked to Kelter\u2019s office, and when I got there and turned, Eli had gone. Inside, I found Kelter at his desk, smoking a joint, which smelled just as bad as the corridor.</p><p>\u201cThat little prick owes me money,\u201d I said, making up something on the spur of the moment to explain why I\u2019d run after Riggs. I leaned a hip against Kelter\u2019s desk. He was pasty white and didn\u2019t seem to really hear what I was saying. Of course he was half lit with liquor and pot, but his tolerance was usually a little higher. \u201cSo, what do you got for me?\u201d I said.</p><p>He regarded me through a vapor of Mary Jane, but the cockiness from before was gone. He looked genuinely scared, and I felt no pity for him at all. \u201cWhat do you want, Riley?\u201d he asked. His eyes squinted as he pulled another drag.</p><p>\u201cTonight, nothing. Not after the stunt that kid just pulled. Later? A couple dozen Oxys,\u201d I said, the familiar words feeling dirty against my tongue. \u201cEnough for a party. As long as you\u2019re still in good with your cousin?\u201d Kelter\u2019s cousin was on the SPD, and yeah\u2014a dirty cop.</p><p>\u201cTonight\u2019s a freebie.\u201d Kelter reached into his desk drawer and retrieved a ziplock similar to the one Riggs had taken, only smaller, quart sized, and rolled like a cigarette. He stood and eased around the desk, leaning close to me, and handed me the dope. When I reached for it, he grabbed my arm and held it tightly. I resisted the urge to shove my knuckles into his carotid.</p><p>\u201cRoom four, babe,\u201d he said, and moved his other hand to my thigh. \u201cThat\u2019s our old room, remember? When you\u2019re ready for the seven deadly sins, let me know. You remember the rules, right?\u201d he asked, and slid his fingers along the inside seam of my leather pants. \u201cOr do you need a little reminder?\u201d</p><p>Inside I screamed; I wanted to knee his nuts so bad it hurt. But instead I put on a pouty face and nodded. \u201cYeah. I remember. There are none.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, and drew another toke from his joint. The scent was making me nauseous, and I wanted out of there. \u201cAnd here I thought all this time you\u2019d cleaned your ass up and made something of yourself.\u201d He chuckled, and I swear his pale face made him look like a ghost. \u201cGuess I was wrong, huh?\u201d He dropped the bag in my hand. \u201cOnce a junkie, always a junkie. See ya round, Riley.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer him; instead, I shoved the dope in my pocket, pushed away from him, and left his office, slamming the door behind me. It didn\u2019t drown out his laughter. What a nasty freak. I was halfway to the double doors when Eli stepped out of the shadows. Immediately, a protective hand went to my lower back. Within the horseshoe, it was like some seedy club in a movie; two guys were standing close, sharing a joint; another couple was hot and heavy against the wall not two feet away, her laced leather shirt completely undone and his hands all over her breasts. Two girls had staked out a dark alcove near the bathroom, one sprawled across the other\u2019s lap; they faced each other, making out and feeling each other up. The one on top had on a short plaid schoolgirl skirt with her knees pulled up, and her thonged ass was hanging out. Swear to God, people these days had no freaking humility. I wasn\u2019t a prude or anything, but damn. \u201cGet a room,\u201d I muttered, but no way did they hear me, and even if they did, they didn\u2019t care. The pressure of Eli\u2019s hand guided me past all the club lovers and into the main room, where we entered a mob of people dancing. Not once did his palm leave my skin. People bumped and knocked into me as they moved to the music, and each time they did, Eli\u2019s grasp tightened against my flesh. I could feel his entire body pressed against me as we weaved through the crowd, and my body hummed with awareness. I liked it.</p><p>Close to the door we ran into Mullet and a tall, leggy girl with a pitch-black bob, straight-across bangs, black pants, and a red tank top with suspenders. Her Goth boots made her an easy two inches taller than Mullet. He made quick introductions; then we left. Mullet had never gotten into the bad stuff, like what went on in the back rooms. He was strictly a partier of music and drink. A really good guy. I sometimes wondered how he remained my friend when I\u2019d been into so much awful stuff.</p><p>At the door, Zetty gave me the stink eye; he knew something was up, and although I hadn\u2019t been around him in some time, it didn\u2019t set right with me that he thought I was into Kelter\u2019s shit again. But I couldn\u2019t tell him otherwise. I waved good-bye and felt his all-knowing mystical Tibetan eyes on me until the door closed.</p><p>Outside, the heavy, wet air from the recent rain hung thick around us, the salt marsh from the Savannah River throwing off a weighty scent, and I breathed deeply, relieved to be outside. I glanced back at the Panic Room and again wondered how such a nondescript building could contain so much . . . sin. And how easily I had become a part of it, way back when.</p><p>\u201cGet on,\u201d Eli said, the anger back in his voice. I looked at him like he\u2019d lost his mind, wondering why he was so mad\u2014especially at me. He said nothing more, so I climbed on and we headed up Martin Luther until we reached Bay.</p><p>\u201cHead to Congress Street,\u201d I said over his shoulder. \u201cMolly McPherson\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>At the traffic light he stopped and half turned to look at me. He said nothing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t feel like going home yet,\u201d I said, and I didn\u2019t. Home was where Seth wasn\u2019t, and it was where Eligius Dupr\u00e9 would be, and the walls of my apartment would close in on me. \u201cPlease?\u201d I asked, and really didn\u2019t like having to plead. Eli didn\u2019t answer, but he made the right turn, and we parked across the street from Congress and walked to Molly\u2019s.</p><p>Inside the atmospheric Scottish pub, I weaved through the small crowd gathered at the long, polished mahogany bar to Martin, the bartender, then grabbed the corner booth by the front window and ordered another whiskey. Eli slid into the booth across from me, his mouth drawn tight, brows pulled together in a pissed-off expression. He didn\u2019t order anything. His light eyes regarded me with such depth, and although he usually observed me in such a manner, tonight was different. There was something different gleaming there, and I wanted to know what it was. I waited, thinking he\u2019d tell me on his own. Too much to expect from a guy, I suppose\u2014even a vampiric one.</p><p>The whiskey arrived, the waitress left, and I leaned forward. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d I asked, now feeling angry myself. \u201cIt\u2019s my brother out there. Not yours.\u201d I literally boiled inside, all of a sudden, and since no one else was around who could take the blame, I put it all on Eli. I let it all out. \u201cMy whole life is screwed up. One day I\u2019m doing well; my brother is smart, safe, and doing super in school; my business is going great and we\u2019re happy\u2014despite our mother being murdered by a freaking psycho and our loser father a lifer in some penitentiary. Now? I wake up and discover . . . unexplainable things exist, my little brother is fast becoming one of them, I have to drink drugged tea to keep an entire family from making me their main course, and I\u2019m trying hard to understand it all, and do what I can to get things back the way they were. So lose your sucky attitude.\u201d I sat back, glaring, my heart beating fast. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for any of this.\u201d</p> <p>Eli regarded me for several seconds, then leaned forward. \u201cI am not a thing,\u201d he said, his voice deadly low. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t ask to be your fucking babysitter.\u201d He raked furious eyes over me and muttered something in French. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>I kept my eyes locked on his as I lifted my whiskey, downed it in one gulp, pulled two bucks from my pocket, and dropped them on the table. \u201cDuties relieved,\u201d I snarled, and headed for the door. I was the last person who needed a freaking babysitter; I\u2019d gone through too much in my young life and handled a lot of problems most never encounter in their entire existence. Screw that. I threw a hand up at Martin when he said, \u201cTake it easy, Riley,\u201d and I pushed out into the City Market nightlife crowd. It was nearly midnight; the tourists had somewhat thinned, but the locals, the SCAD students, still hung around, and would for a few more hours. It wasn\u2019t like I blended into the crowd; I stood out because of more than my choice of clothing. I was tall on top of it, and I knew that if Eli wanted to come after me, he\u2019d have no trouble. Still, leaving returned to me some sort of control; I\u2019d lost it, and dammit, I wanted it back. I didn\u2019t like my every move being tracked. It was . . . suffocating.</p><p>As I walked up Congress, moving farther away from Molly\u2019s, the air grew somewhat quieter, and Capote\u2019s familiar music tinged the air; I headed straight for John-son Square and found him among the mossy oaks. When he saw me, he lowered his sax.</p><p>\u201cNow, dere\u2019s a sight,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cHow you walk in dem things?\u201d he pointed to my boots.</p><p>I walked up and hugged the older Gullah, and he patted my back. \u201cDere now, baby. You don\u2019t worry about nothin\u2019, you hear? You listen to da Preacher man and do what dem Dupr\u00e9s say.\u201d He chuckled the laugh of a man who\u2019d seen it all. \u201cI known you long enough, Riley Poe, to know you ain\u2019t takin\u2019 fast to havin\u2019 someone tell you what to do, right? But you keep dat temper down.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cYou mind dem.\u201d</p> <p>I gave Capote a smile and a nod. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d I inclined my head to his sax. \u201cDon\u2019t stop playing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa-ha,\u201d Capote laughed, and gave a nod. \u201cI never do, baby.\u201d He started again, his music soothing and enlightening all at once. So, even old Capote knew about the vampires of Savannah. Somehow, I wasn\u2019t shocked. A slow, light drizzle began again, but I didn\u2019t care. I stood there surrounded by towering live oaks draped in moss, and I watched the long gray clumps sway in the breeze. The streetlamps cast a tawny glow against the slick brick and cobbles, making them seem glassy, and I inhaled a long, deep lungful of sultry August air. It almost calmed me, until I remembered the cicadas. Rather, their absence.</p><p>A couple walked up, wrapped in each other\u2019s arms, and stood close by to listen to Capote play. I stood there for a moment longer; then with a wave, I left and started walking up Whitaker toward Bay. I let my thoughts ramble. I was somewhat shocked that Eli had allowed me this much freedom; perhaps he sincerely was sick of babysitting and had gone back to his parents with a refusal to do it any longer. I couldn\u2019t blame him. I\u2019d been a bitch. I\u2019d allowed the situation to overwhelm me, and I\u2019d called him a . . . thing. I of course hadn\u2019t meant the Dupr\u00e9s were things, but at the time, it had sounded that way; maybe I\u2019d allowed it to sound that way, too. Some small, sick part of me wanted to make Eli sting, and I didn\u2019t know why. I thought of Eli as anything but a thing. I found him intriguing, mysterious, and disturbingly unique. The attraction I felt for him seemed real, not just heightened because he was a vampire. Hell\u2014I sometimes had to remind myself he really was a vampire. Other than his exceptional capabilities, and his transformation in my bedroom when Seth had lunged toward me, I\u2019d not witnessed anything overt. He and his siblings and his mother and father certainly weren\u2019t like Hollywood vampires. They seemed like an ordinary, loving family. Yet . . . I felt it. I felt that they were anything but ordinary\u2014that, and much, much more. Precarious circumstances were keeping things settled. I knew that. Just like I knew that one day very soon, I\u2019d see them. Really see them.</p><p>Just as I crossed Bryan Street, I heard them. I don\u2019t know how I knew it was Riggs, Seth, and the others, but I did\u2014maybe it was their distinctive, squeaky, adolescent laughter. I searched the darkness, down Bryan Street, and there they were: seven altogether, wearing dark hoodies like some weird fight-club, free-running hoodie cult, surrounding some skinny dude on the sidewalk. He was alone, and the boys were harassing him, crowding the guy against a car parked on the curb. I couldn\u2019t tell which one was Seth; they all looked alike from my vantage point. They weren\u2019t full-fledged vampires yet, still just a bunch of stupid kids experiencing quickening, so I changed directions, ducked into the shadows, and moved toward them. I knew I could take at least three of their skinny little asses out; maybe then they\u2019d run off and leave the guy alone. Junkie or not, I wasn\u2019t going to stand by and watch while they killed him, or lured him. Whichever.</p><p>By the time I\u2019d gotten close, the boys had surrounded the guy and were pushing him, laughing, calling him foul names. I could tell right then that the guy was as high as a kite; he just flailed between the boys, and they laughed, and he even laughed with them. It enraged me. He didn\u2019t deserve what they had for him\u2014either transformation by the Arcoses, or ending up as their freaking dinner. Both were unacceptable.</p><p>No sooner did I step out of the shadows than I was pushed back into them, and Eli\u2019s body pinned me against the brick wall of an empty historic residence that had a FOR SALE sign in the yard. Damn, he was fast. Freaking fast, silent and strong. I pushed with all my strength and couldn\u2019t budge him a fraction of an inch. I hadn\u2019t even heard him coming. We were front to front, our bodies pressed intimately together. He looked down at me as the brick scored into the bared flesh of my back, and he put his finger to his lips. Shushing me.</p> <p>He glanced over his shoulder and then lowered his mouth to my ear. \u201cNo matter what you see, stay here,\u201d he warned, and when he lifted his head and looked at me, I saw just how much he meant it. I nodded, and just that fast he moved off of me. I barely felt the air shift as he stirred.</p><p>In the next breath, Eli stood among the boys and in one lightning-fast move pushed the junkie clear; he landed on the other side of the car with a thud and a moan. Now the boys surrounded Eli, and they became a pack of wild dogs, darting at him, growling; in the middle of two streetlamps, a long shadow fell over Eli, and as I watched, my gut in knots, I saw his transformation. It took all of two seconds, and as I caught glimpses of his horrible face, opaque eyes, unhinged jaw, and jagged fangs, my insides clinched with fear. It was still a hard thing to comprehend. Don\u2019t hurt them! I yelled inside my head. I wanted their asses kicked, not killed. They were just boys, and one of them was Seth. Eli had two by the throat; I couldn\u2019t tell who they were, but their faces were so pale I could see their seemingly luminescent skin almost glowing from where I stood pressed against the brick. Eli dangled them high, their sneakers completely off the ground; then he threw them\u2014threw both of them. They landed in the street, and like strung-out users, they jumped right up, unfazed, and lunged at him again. The others followed. Next, adolescent bodies flew everywhere as Eli tossed them like rag dolls; the boys got right back up and surged toward him. Snarls and curses filled the air as they fought; I don\u2019t know how much control Eli issued to keep them alive, but he somehow managed. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Maybe with two, they wouldn\u2019t make such bold moves.</p><p>The moment I stepped out of the shadows and into the street, one of the rabid boys noticed me and lunged. I mean freaking lunged. He was on me in seconds, and I found myself flat on my back in the middle of the street. Beneath the hoodie I stared into a pair of opaque eyes and a pale face; relief washed over me when I saw it wasn\u2019t Seth. It was his other friend, Todd, and I grabbed the boy by his skinny throat and held his gnashing mouth away from me. The sensation of his Adam\u2019s apple bobbing up and down against my palm made me want to shake him off. But the kid was as strong as a friggin\u2019 ox, and it took all of my strength to push him back and shove him off of me. I rolled and crouched, and just as Todd lunged again, I kicked with the flat of my shin and knocked him back. It was almost as if he hadn\u2019t felt it; he rushed me again, and this time I gripped both of my hands together to make one big fist and swung upward as he neared me, then elbowed his solar plexus. Still he came at me and in seconds had me on my back again. As much as I hated it, I fished the dope out of my pocket and dangled the baggie in front of Todd with my free hand; his eyes averted from mine, and he grabbed it. Then a smile pulled at his mouth, and it made my insides ice over. His fist came down on my mouth with blinding speed; I didn\u2019t even have time to deflect it. Warm liquid spilled onto my lip, and the pinpoint pupils in Todd\u2019s white eyes widened as he stared hard at me, at my mouth. At my blood. Damn. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Out of the darkness, the other Dupr\u00e9s emerged and descended upon the boys; it took all of three seconds for the boys to realize they were outweighed. Todd leapt off me, and he and the others took off down the street, laughing, leaping off ledges, and doing crazy, mindless jumps that landed them into handstands; they kept on running, kept moving. I could hardly believe one of them was Seth. Seth wouldn\u2019t believe he was Seth. Phin, Luc, and Josie took off after them in the same manner, until darkness swallowed them all. Only their echoes bounced off the buildings of the historic district.</p><p>By the time Eli emerged by my side, he\u2019d transformed into the beautiful guy I\u2019d grown painfully used to; all traces of his previous horror vanished. Now he looked more pissed than he had before. His gaze lit on my bleeding lip, and his frown deepened, nostrils flared.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell are you doing, Riley?\u201d Eli asked, and yanked me up hard, nearly flinging me across the street. \u201cCan\u2019t you listen to anyone? Something wrong with your goddamn ears?\u201d he asked. He looked down, shook his head, and then clasped his hands behind his neck and stared up and off into the shadows. \u201cWipe the blood off your mouth. Now,\u201d he said with almost a growl.</p> <p>Pulling my minipack off my back, I opened it and searched for something to get the blood off my lip. An old Krispy Kreme napkin wrapped around a wad of gum sat in the bottom; I quickly used it.</p><p>\u201cThrow it down,\u201d Eli commanded.</p><p>Without question, I did as he asked. I knew that having fresh blood on my face was stupid. I wasn\u2019t about to push Eli. Not now.</p><p>\u201cOne of them could have easily killed you,\u201d he said without looking at me. Then he turned on me. \u201cAll of them would have left nothing for the coroner to piece together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014,\u201d I started.</p> <p>\u201cIf you say you can take care of yourself one more damn time, I\u2019m gonna explode,\u201d he ground out between clinched teeth. In a blink he was at me, grasping my shoulders and all but shaking me. \u201cYou can\u2019t, Riley. Not with this. This is way out of your capabilities, no matter how much of a badass you think you are.\u201d He did shake me then. \u201cDo you hear me?\u201d He drew so close, our noses nearly touched, and his eyes bored hard into mine. \u201cWhen I tell you stay put, stay the fuck put.\u201d</p><p>I could do nothing more than scowl at Eli. I didn\u2019t like being chastised, even if he was right.</p><p>He shook me harder, his expression lethal. \u201cI don\u2019t care that you don\u2019t like being chastised. Next time\u201d\u2014his face hardened\u2014\u201clisten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet. Go. Of. Me,\u201d I said, emphasizing each word with as much venom as I could muster. He did, and I turned on my heels and began walking, back toward Whitaker, Eli a few steps behind. I played with my cut lip with my tongue and didn\u2019t say a word until we stopped at the cross light on Bay. \u201cIf your brothers and sister follow Seth and Riggs, why is it that we still don\u2019t know where the Arcoses are . . . restoring, rejuvenating, or whatever it is they\u2019re doing?\u201d I asked, frustrated. \u201cWon\u2019t the boys lead them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said flatly, the light from the streetlamp behind him throwing his whole face into darkness. \u201cThey will play all night until dawn, jumping the rooftops and gathering forces, reveling in their freedom and new-found powers; they\u2019ll eventually disperse and run in different directions, and the Arcoses will continue to move. Even if we did follow the boys, they\u2019d never be able to lead us to the brothers. The Arcoses are too smart for that. Weak as they are, they\u2019ll move, too.\u201d He ducked his head and caught my gaze. \u201cPatience.\u201d</p><p>I glanced back down the street, where the junkie was just stumbling up the sidewalk. \u201cThey were going to kill that guy,\u201d I said, sickened by the thought.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Eli said. \u201cThey were going to either lure him to the Arcoses or force him. Either way, yes\u2014he would have died. They prey on people like him\u2014homeless, junkies, prostitutes\u2014because they\u2019re easily overlooked in the public eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if your parents helped? And Ned? If we all gathered and followed Seth and the others, couldn\u2019t we just take them?\u201d I said angrily. \u201cI just don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>Eli grasped me by the chin and held my head in place as he looked at me. \u201cYou\u2019re forgetting about the Gullah magic, Riley,\u201d he said harshly. \u201cThey\u2019re untouchable until fully regenerated. It might get your brother and his friends killed if we overstepped the boundaries of the magic. Understand?\u201d</p><p>I had a hard time breathing; Eli\u2019s face in shadows, the glassy reflection in his eyes\u2014even his angry voice all but lulled me into another zone. \u201cNot really,\u201d I said, equally angered. \u201cBut I guess I have no choice but to go along with it, huh?\u201d</p><p>Eli dropped his hand and stepped away. \u201cYeah. It\u2019d make things a hell of a lot easier if you did.\u201d</p><p>Thunder rumbled directly overhead, and just that fast, heavy drops of rain began to fall. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said, and we started home. The cars on Bay rolled by on the wet pavement with a hiss, and the warmth of coastal Savannah mixed with that unique smell only rain has. I inhaled deeply. It seemed the last of normalcy for me, and I greedily sucked it in. The rain fell faster and harder, and before we\u2019d even made it to merchant\u2019s drive, we were both soaked. I stomped up the cobbles in my spiked boots, my hair like a pile of wet moss hanging in thick, sopping hanks, my skin slick from the rain and the lotion I\u2019d used earlier.</p><p>Everything hit me at once: Seth, the Dupr\u00e9s, Eli, the Arcoses, strigoi, the Kindred, Kelter and his dirty hands\u2014it all overwhelmed me, and I began to shake. Goddamn, I hated being weak! I yanked my pack off my back and frantically dug for my house key.</p><p>Eli\u2019s body pushed close to mine. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he said.</p> <p>My gaze flew to his, emotions taking over me. I remembered his words in Molly\u2019s, and it pissed me off all over again. \u201cWhy do you care?\u201d I said vehemently. \u201cYou\u2019re just a fucking babysitter, right?\u201d I found the key and tried to jam it into the lock, but my unsteady, frustrated hands prevented it, and I cursed under my breath. \u201cWhat happens to me, to Seth\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter to you.\u201d I looked at him again through a sheet of rain highlighted by the glow of lamplight. \u201cWe\u2019re nothing to you. Just part of a contract, right, Eli?\u201d</p><p>In a move so fast I didn\u2019t know it\u2019d happened until it had, Eli grabbed my bag and threw it on the cobbles, then shoved me hard against Inksomnia\u2019s back door. He pushed in and crowded me, and I had nowhere to go. I felt his presence all around me, and as the rain fell against my face, it dripped from his hair, too, and onto my face, my chest; I could do little more than stare at him incredulously. \u201cGet off of me,\u201d I said angrily, my voice cracking, deep as I struggled not to lose it.</p><p>Eli shook his head and studied my face. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, his voice softer, not as angered as before. His hands moved to my hips and yanked me against him. He drew his face even closer. \u201cYou have no idea how much restraint I\u2019ve used to keep my hands off of you,\u201d he said, his hands slipping under my leather vest and along my bare rib cage. I shivered beneath his touch. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted you from the second I saw you through your storefront, and every dirty desire and thought you\u2019ve had became mine.\u201d He leaned heavier against me, his gaze dangerous, fierce. \u201cI nearly lost my mind the night you thought of me and touched yourself,\u201d he whispered against my ear. \u201cI almost took you then,\u201d he said, his gaze fixed on mine. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted you every second since. I can\u2019t control myself anymore.\u201d His hands skimmed my rain-slicked lower back, grasped my ass, and pulled me against his hardness; his gaze grew dark, and he lowered his mouth to my ear and whispered erotically, \u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure being your fucking babysitter, Riley Poe. But now I want more.\u201d</p><p>Never had any form of the word fuck sounded so sensual, but falling in a whisper from Eli\u2019s sexy mouth, in the context he\u2019d used, his voice heavy with need and with his breath brushing my wet neck? A total turn-on, and my skin flushed with heat despite the rain. I wanted his hands all over me; I wanted out of the leather. I wanted him inside me, and whatever consequence came along with it. As long as it was Eli, I didn\u2019t care. Danger and fear of what could happen was easily forgotten as sensations took control. My mind was of myriad sexual pleasures I couldn\u2019t help but think of, and Eli cued in on every one of them by invading my thoughts. I invited him, welcomed him, and let him take control.</p><p>Perfect, sexy, curved lips hovered close to mine, and his eyes watched my reaction as he grasped the zipper of my leather vest and slowly lowered it, exposing my abdomen and the hot pink swimsuit top that pushed my breasts up; I know he heard my breath catch at his touch\u2014I could see it in his eyes. My leather pants were low-riders and sat a good two inches below my navel, and with one hand Eli explored the rain-slicked skin and muscles of my stomach; then the other pulled me free of the vest. I leaned into him, reached up and threaded my fingers through his wet hair and grasped the back of his neck, and for a split second, we stood motionless, staring. He could kill me in under two seconds, my blood a fiery temptation, and I didn\u2019t even care. As long as he kept his hands on me, fear escaped me. He ran his palm up my side and over my breast, and stilled it over my heart. It pounded wildly against his hand. I had no idea what ran through his mind, and I wasn\u2019t too sure I wanted to know. But desperation and awe filled mine; I couldn\u2019t remember ever needing someone so badly\u2014my insides actually ached with want, desire, and I wasn\u2019t even sure why. But it had to be now. And it had to be Eli.</p><p>With the rain falling against my face, Eli lowered his head and pressed his mouth to mine; it felt like a match had been struck, and I gasped at the contact. A current soared between us, palpable and hot, and Eli shoved me hard against the wall as he kissed me, both hands leaving my body to push into my hair and hold my head in place. His tongue against mine made me struggle for breath, struggle for more, and I slid my hands up his shirt to feel the hard ridges of his abdomen. He groaned against my mouth, then tore his lips away to press against my ear. \u201cInside,\u201d he said, his voice dark, dangerous, on edge. \u201cNow.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Without waiting on me, Eli turned me around to face the door; I struggled to jam the key in the lock. Behind me, Eli\u2019s body pressed against mine, his front to my back, and as his fingers pushed my hair aside, his lips sought my neck and his hands slipped around my waist, down over my hips, where he pulled me against him. Urgency and raw need ripped through me at his touch, so much that it didn\u2019t even strike me to think that a vampire\u2019s mouth was on my throat\u2014skin that barely sheeted a vessel carrying a unique, druglike blood type. Honest to God, I didn\u2019t care at that point. I did not care.</p><p>Finally, the key worked. I grabbed my pack off the ground and opened the door, and we stumbled inside. Eli\u2019s hands never left my body, and as the door shut, the pack dropped from my hand, and we fell back against the door, his body pressed into mine, our tongues entwined, tasting, not getting enough. I felt him everywhere at once; every nerve ending throughout me hummed with heat, and the unique way he tasted made me crave, beg with my hands as I slipped my impatient fingers over the buttons of his fly. There was nothing gentle about either of us. I wanted him yesterday.</p><p>\u201cUpstairs,\u201d he muttered against my ear, and before I could hit the first step he\u2019d pulled me against him again, both hands on my face as he lowered his mouth to mine; he kissed me long, then pulled back, and only the stream of light shining in from the storefront caught his eyes, making them appear dark, almost black. Never had I seen desire so heavy in a pair of eyes. \u201cHold on,\u201d he said, his voice husky, raspy, and as I slid my hands around his neck, he lifted me, and I wrapped my legs around his waist. It was sixteen steps up to my apartment, and he kissed me the whole way.</p> <p>Upstairs, I slid from his arms, and we stumbled together in the shadows, down the hall and into my room, our lips fastened, hungry, and I found myself once again hard against a brick wall, my fingers desperately grasping at Eli\u2019s button fly and unfastening a few. I pushed his shirt up, and he took over, yanking it over his head; my palms skimmed the ripped muscles of his stomach, his chest, and I eased my hand inside his fly and over the hard ridge of his cock; his painful groan escaped his throat at my touch, and I slid my other hand around his ass and pulled him harder against me. When his gaze met mine, his eyes were dark, glassy, dangerous, and lost in desire. It turned me on even more.</p><p>Without words, Eli slid his hands up my stomach and over my breasts, where he nimbly released the single clasp keeping my top together. He slid it off my shoulders and dropped it on the floor. At the same time his mouth claimed mine once more, his hands claimed my breasts, and I pushed my body against him with blinding need. I couldn\u2019t get close enough, fast enough\u2014as though I wanted to just sink into his skin. I wanted him all over me, everywhere.</p><p>With deft fingers Eli trailed his hands down my abdomen to the buttons of my pants, and as he released each one I shivered with anticipation. I kicked out of my boots, he kicked out of his, and finally, we were both free of clothes and restrictions. The only thing that remained was a pair of slender black G-string panties; even those felt more like armor than the weightless, seductive cloth they were meant to be. I wanted to rip them off; Eli read my mind, lowered his hand, and did it for me, then tossed the shredded material to the floor.</p><p>We were nothing more than silhouettes and shadows as we stared at each other, with only the tapered band of light streaming in through the French doors. Eli\u2019s hands slid to my hips, over my ass, his eyes watching me intently. \u201cTurn around,\u201d he said, his voice neither a whisper nor a growl but something in between. It sounded more inside my head than in my ears, and I did what he asked, my front now facing the wall.</p><p>Eli\u2019s hands pushed my heavy hair aside; his fingers drifted to my lower back, then slowly up my spine; he was tracing my dragons, and continued up my shoulders and down each arm, where he slipped his fingers between mine, his lips and tongue tasting my neck, my shoulder. I shuddered with anticipation. It was the only thing gentle that occurred between us after that. In a blinding move, he spun me around and pinned me against the aged bricks of my bedroom wall and kissed me frantically, desperation in every suck, every lick, every taste, and I met his fury with the same enthusiasm, gasping in between. His hips were muscular and narrow, and I glided my hands around them to his ass and pulled him against me. Eli\u2019s hands were everywhere, touching every curve, every valley, and when his hardness throbbed heavy against my thigh, a groan escaped my throat, and I reached down, found it, and palmed its sleek ridges. In one effortless move he lifted me, the grainy bricks scraping my back, and as I wound my legs around his waist, he pushed into me. The deep groan that came from Eli\u2019s throat made me shiver, and he muttered something in French. God, I was so wet, out of my mind with need, and Eli satisfied it in three hard thrusts; lights exploded behind my eyes as the fiercest orgasm I\u2019d ever experienced wracked my body, and Eli continued to pound into me, his mouth buried in the crevice of my neck and shoulder, his groans muffled, his orgasm violent as his body spasmed against me. Strong hands grasped mine, spread them out against the wall, and laced his fingers through mine. The kiss that followed nearly undid me all over again; different from the frantic kiss from before, it was slow, erotic, and Eli took his time tasting every inch of my mouth and neck. Without words and with me still clinging to him, he walked backward, turned, and laid me on the bed. There wasn\u2019t anything either of us could have said; everything was still fresh, tantalizing, and my whole body hummed with pleasure. For a moment, my eyes drifted shut, but when they opened, Eli stood over me, and I froze. His eyes had turned opaque\u2014literally luminescent as he stared down hungrily at me.</p> <p>\u201cEli?\u201d I said warily, and when he didn\u2019t move, I repeated myself, except stronger this time. \u201cEli!\u201d No other words would come out of my mouth. I was scared. And I could tell he struggled for control.</p><p>He quickly turned, grabbed his clothes off the floor, and left so fast my eyes couldn\u2019t follow. I wasn\u2019t in total shock. Now that my mind and body had started to recover from the mind-blowing sex I\u2019d just shared with Eli, I recalled how many times he\u2019d said how he wasn\u2019t sure his control could last. It had barely lasted. What did shock me, though, was that he didn\u2019t just leave my room. He left my apartment. Leaving me totally alone\u2014as in wide-open prey for the Arcos brothers and their growing hoodie cult.</p><p>As I slipped beneath the sheets, I reached over, switched the ceiling fan on low, and closed my eyes, letting my mind wander. I was a big girl, and I\u2019d been through a hell of a lot in twenty-five years. I\u2019d been used in the very worst of ways; rejection and abandonment weren\u2019t unfamiliar to me. I\u2019d be a liar if I said it hadn\u2019t stung to watch Eli walk out, but I understood. I guess I wasn\u2019t like other girls in that sense. Being a crybaby just wasn\u2019t in my repertoire. I\u2019d learned over the years not to be greedy; take what little bits of life\u2019s pleasures you could, while you could\u2014you might not get another offer.</p><p>I turned onto my side and stretched, pulling one of the spare down pillows to my middle and cradling it against my bare body. Before slumber dragged me under, I replayed the past hour of my life with Eli, and I knew then that another man would never be able to satisfy me like he had. The way I\u2019d responded to his body, his mouth, his touch . . . no one could ever live up to that. Never. I knew what I spoke of, if you know what I mean. I wasn\u2019t sure whether I should be pissed, or grateful for the experience. Part of me knew\u2014felt it in my gut\u2014that something much deeper than wild, nasty sex had occurred with Eli Dupr\u00e9, but it\u2019d do no good to dwell on it now, and it may very well have been solely on my part. He\u2019d almost transformed, almost lost control. I mean, seriously\u2014he\u2019d lived for nearly two hundred years. He\u2019d had plenty of experiences, and I\u2019m positive I wouldn\u2019t be the last orgasm he\u2019d ever experience. For a hot minute, it was a nice thought. But like I said\u2014I wasn\u2019t stupid. Rough around the edges maybe, definitely a little perverted at times, but never stupid. I was a survivor. I\u2019d damn well survive this.</p><p>Finally, I drifted off to sleep. I knew, even though Eli had left my apartment, that he was still close by. I knew one night of hot, rampant sex certainly wasn\u2019t a marriage proposal. Not that I wanted one. But if I knew Eli at all, I did know he wouldn\u2019t leave me unprotected. He was out there, somewhere. I knew it. Watching. Just like he had been when I was oblivious to the fact that vampires existed.</p><p>Sometime during the early-morning hours, before dawn, I awoke with fear choking me\u2014literally. I was coughing as though I\u2019d been strangled; my heart slammed hard against my ribs, and adrenaline surged through my veins. I sat up and tried to catch my breath, and the bare threads of a nightmare rushed back. Sweat plastered my bangs to my face, and I pushed them behind my ears and rubbed my eyes, trying to remember.</p> <p>In the dream, I couldn\u2019t tell where I was; long shadows blocked street names and building signs, but it was desolate\u2014almost postapocalyptic. Everything was gray, colorless\u2014except me. My black hair with red-and-fuchsia highlights, and white skin stuck out like a sore thumb, and dressed in nothing but a short leather skirt, tall leather boots, and a vest, I ran, fast, down a cracked, broken sidewalk. What few cars sat parked along the sidewalk were as abandoned and derelict as the buildings. Where I hurried to, I didn\u2019t know, but I knew something chased me. Maybe more than one. They slinked through the shadows overhead, on the rooftops. I glanced behind me, only for a second; when I turned back around, he was there. Young, virile, flawlessly beautiful, and very, very powerful; his very nearness caused me to burn for him. Seductively, he licked his lips, and just that fast I envisioned his mouth and tongue between my legs, erotically caressing until I fell to my knees as spasms of orgasm wracked my body. I didn\u2019t want it\u2014I couldn\u2019t help but take it. It infuriated me, his seduction, and I knew then that he would haunt me always, and never cease his pursuit of me. He had power over me. He wasn\u2019t Eli. . . .</p><p>I sat up with a start. Somehow, I\u2019d fallen asleep again, even after remembering that most vivid of dreams. It left me feeling dirty; it left me with heavy desire. Early dawn was just beginning to break, and as I slipped from the bed, I noticed the French doors were wide-open. They were closed before. . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Crossing the room, I closed the doors and latched them, then jumped in the shower. As the hot water ran down my body, I felt drained; my energy had dissipated. Once I finished, I quickly dressed in board shorts and a tank top and dried my hair, and just as I walked into the living room, I pulled up short. Sprawled across the sofa watching TV was Phin Dupr\u00e9, Chaz\u2019s head resting in his lap. Both glanced up as I walked into the room, and Phin regarded me with eyes so much like Eli\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re the new babysitter, huh?\u201d I asked, although I already knew the answer. I met Phin\u2019s gaze as I pulled my hair up into a ponytail, then glanced at the TV. I looked at Phin and lifted a brow. \u201cThe Lost Boys?\u201d I asked, noting the eighties cult vampire movie as it played across my flat screen.</p><p>Phin gave a cocky smile. \u201cFreaking awesome movie,\u201d he said. \u201cClassic.\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head and grinned, and it struck me as funny that a vampire would dig a cult vampire movie. \u201cYeah, it is.\u201d I wanted to ask where Eli was, but I didn\u2019t. I kept it to myself and figured that whatever was going to happen would happen. Like I said before\u2014I wasn\u2019t the crying-over-spilled-milk type of girl.</p><p>\u201cSo yeah, I\u2019m the new babysitter,\u201d he said, then scrubbed Chaz between the ears and stood. I glared at my dog, whose only response to me was a little hiniesca-thumping against the sofa cushion.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do, brainwash my dog?\u201d I asked, scowling at Chaz.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Come on, dogs love me,\u201d Phin said, and moved toward me. He cocked his head and crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do to piss off Eli?\u201d Before I could answer, realization crossed his features. \u201cAh\u2014never mind.\u201d He shook his head and mumbled something in French that sounded something like sack ray blue, rubbed his jaw, and regarded me even more closely. He shook his head again. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I said, and turned directly to Eli\u2019s brother. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here, but I have to have a game plan to get my brother back. If it\u2019s changed from before, just tell me\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t,\u201d Phin said. \u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>I slid my flip-flops on. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father and Preacher agreed to your training,\u201d he said, \u201cat Eli\u2019s urging. Mainly for safety purposes.\u201d</p><p>As I let that congeal in my brain, I realized that was what I\u2019d wanted all along, and Eli had known it. \u201cGreat. Vampires training me to kill vampires. When do we start?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cToday. Tonight we\u2019ll run the streets a little, and tomorrow night we\u2019ll hit the Panic Room along with a few others, if you\u2019re up to it. This time, you\u2019re hangin\u2019 with Luc and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d I answered, although the void Eli had left suddenly seemed larger. I stood there, contemplating, then walked to the door. \u201cCome on, Chaz\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI already walked him.\u201d</p><p>I stopped and did not look back. \u201cMy control over my life has fizzled into nothingness,\u201d I said. \u201cI can\u2019t even walk my freaking dog anymore.\u201d I walked to the door and let myself out, Phin directly on my heels.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said as we made our way to Preacher\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNot your fault,\u201d I said, although I wanted it to be someone\u2019s fault.</p><p>As we crossed the cobbles to Da Plat Eye, Phin leaned close. \u201cSo, Riley,\u201d he began casually. \u201cWhat\u2019s the story on your friend Nyx?\u201d He chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty hot.\u201d</p><p>I snapped a glare at him. \u201cDon\u2019t even think it, porcupine.\u201d</p><p>Phin rubbed his close-cut hair and grinned. \u201cI\u2019m just sayin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>After breakfast\u2014I had to sit through forty-five minutes of a wicked stink eye from Preacher man\u2014we left. I needed some air, so I took Chaz for a walk down the riverfront and contemplated my next moves. Without Eli was what I thought, and was glad as hell he wasn\u2019t around to listen in.</p> <p>The day was overcast, with a residue of last night\u2019s rain clinging to the air, as I walked by the river, Chaz at my side. The bricks were wet and dark from rain, and not even the slightest breeze shifted the thick, muggy air. The familiar cooked-sugar-praline scent from River Street Sweets wafted by, but I discovered that even that simple pleasure didn\u2019t sit well with me. A few people were out and about, tourists taking pictures of the Savannah River Queen\u2014an old-time riverboat\u2014and the storefronts. Most businesses were closed on Sundays; the others opened up later in the day, so only a few people were out and about, which was fine with me. I was in a foul mood, and I didn\u2019t feel like dealing with anyone\u2014not even a total stranger.</p><p>My thoughts returned to earlier, at Preacher\u2019s, where Phin had gone over very little of what I\u2019d be learning while in training. I already knew how to fight; that was a plus. He said I\u2019d learn the rest from his papa at the House of Dupr\u00e9. Preacher had looked hard at me, then stated that two of his boys would remain at the house with me at all times. Seemed kind of silly; if a house of vampires decided to take me\u2014one little ol\u2019 mortal\u2014down, I\u2019m pretty sure they could do it, and no one would be able to stop them. It was about trust. Like I\u2019d trusted Eli last night, I\u2019d trust the Dupr\u00e9s now. Really\u2014we had no choice. I had no choice. My life for Seth\u2019s? Hell yes, in a second.</p><p>Returning home, I gave Nyx a quick call; then, changing into a pair of black Lycra yoga pants, a white ribbed tank, and a pair of black Adidas workout shoes, I tightened my ponytail, left my apartment with Phin, and headed to the House of Dupr\u00e9. A mortal with an extremely rare blood type strolling directly into a house of vampires. Yeah. I\u2019d lost my freaking mind. Again.</p><p>Part 8</p><p>MARTYR</p><p>The moment I stepped foot through the back entrance of the House of Dupr\u00e9, I knew Eli wasn\u2019t there. Somehow, in all of the four-thousand-plus square feet of the historic landmark, I could sense he was gone. I tried not to let his absence bother me, but it did.</p><p>Gilles, Elise, Luc, and Josie were in the main sitting room when Phin and I walked in. I immediately noticed Jack and Tuba\u2014two of Preacher\u2019s great-nephews\u2014standing near the back. Both were big guys, and they both carried several familiar pouches attached to their belts. I would bet at least one of them contained graveyard dust. I gave them a nod and greeted the Dupr\u00e9s.</p><p>\u201cWelcome again, ch\u00e8re,\u201d Gilles said. He looked just as aristocratic as he had the previous time, and it was weird. He seemed so genuine. A smile touched his lips, and I wished like hell I could command my thoughts instead of rambling on. He was just as bad as Eli about reading my mind.</p><p>\u201cI would speak with you alone, if I might?\u201d Gilles asked.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said, and when he directed me to the hallway, I followed\u2014and so did Jack and Tuba. I turned to them both and held up a hand. \u201cGuys, seriously.\u201d</p><p>Neither looked happy, but they stopped at the door.</p><p>\u201cYou are quite a brave young lady, Riley Poe,\u201d Gilles said in the foyer. \u201cMy eldest son was right about you after all.\u201d</p><p>That got my attention, but I tamped my reaction down. Way down. \u201cOh? And why is that?\u201d</p><p>Gilles gave a soft, all-knowing laugh. \u201cMy dear, you do not have to hide anything from me.\u201d He rubbed his chin and regarded me. \u201cNot that you could. Still,\u201d he said smiling. \u201cI applaud your attempt.\u201d He paced before me, his footfall tapping the parquet flooring of the foyer. \u201cHe confessed to me his actions last night.\u201d</p><p>It takes a lot to mortify me these days. Like I\u2019ve said\u2014I\u2019d experienced a million indecencies and humilities in my youth, and I thought all modesty had flown out the window. But when Gilles Dupr\u00e9 told me his son had confessed his actions with me? Eesh! \u201cI hope he didn\u2019t tell you everything,\u201d I said.</p><p>Gilles\u2019 blue eyes sparkled. \u201cHis mind is just as easy for me to read as yours, ch\u00e8re.\u201d He inclined his head. \u201cHe\u2019s at the isle with your dark fellows. He felt he needed a . . . rejuvenation, I suppose you would say.\u201d</p><p>I stared incredulously. \u201cYou mean, he needed some extra hoodoo herbs in his blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui. And if I may be frank with you?\u201d Gilles asked politely.</p><p>I gave a short laugh. \u201cOf course,\u201d I replied, as if he could be any more frank.</p><p>\u201cEligius nearly took your life last night, Riley Poe. He exerted more control than you could possibly comprehend by mating with you and . . . leaving you alive. That\u2019s why he left, and why Phin is in his stead.\u201d He cocked his head and seemed to study me, beyond my eyes and deep into my soul. \u201cEligius cares for you. And I know you care for him.\u201d He moved closer and stroked my cheek with a long finger. \u201cBut when a vampire cares for another, it is . . . different. Deeper. And \u2019twill end badly, ch\u00e8re,\u201d he said quietly, with remorse in his eyes. \u201cBetween our kind and mortals, it always does.\u201d With that, he turned and left me alone in the foyer.</p><p>I forced myself to swallow past the hard lump in my throat, and I really didn\u2019t know what to do next. I supposed Gilles was right. How could anything have ever worked out between Eli and me? It was the age-old reason found in every vampire romance novel, every vampire movie: The vampire would never age, and the mortal woman would grow old and die. Same old, same old. It was so clich\u00e9, but so freaking true.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for your first lessons?\u201d Phin said, startling me out of my dreary thoughts.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I replied, and when he inclined his head to follow, I drew a deep breath and followed, as did Jack and Tuba.</p><p>On the top floor of the Dupr\u00e9 House was an enormous room, complete with a martial arts mat, kickboxing bag, boxing bag, and other apparatuses that I couldn\u2019t identify. Luc and Josie were setting up three full-sized dummies on the mat at one end of the room. Silver throwing blades of various sizes and shapes lay on a long table at the other end.</p><p>I gave Phin a curious glance. \u201cSo my training is going to really be about becoming an expert knife thrower?\u201d I asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He chuckled. \u201cSort of.\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to learn how to aim, throw, and score while running, jumping, rolling, and flipping.\u201d He grinned. \u201cHow\u2019s that sound?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cAlmost as crazy as a family of vampires teaching a mortal how to kill vampires.\u201d</p><p>His grin widened. \u201cWe\u2019re not vampires. We\u2019re creatures of the afterlight. We\u2019re . . . special.\u201d</p> <p>So for the next several hours, I did a lot of watching and a lot of throwing of practice blades made of stainless steel. The pure silver blades, handcrafted in France and shipped to the House of Dupr\u00e9, were to be used for the sole purpose of killing other vampires, and they were locked up.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Your goal for the day is to simply try to hit the marks\u2014the heart, of course\u2014of the dummies, i.e., the Arcoses.\u201d Luc sidled up beside me, placed a steel blade in my hand, closed his fingers over mine so that I\u2019d grasp the short hilt, and then lifted my arm so that my hand rested directly behind my ear. \u201cLike this,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t let the blade loose until your arm is fully extended and pointing at your mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d I said, and did as he\u2019d instructed. The blade flew across the room and landed square in the dummy\u2019s forehead.</p><p>\u201cHeart, Riley,\u201d Phin said. \u201cAim for the heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d I said, and everyone chuckled. An hour later, I finally hit the mark. I thought my arm would fall out of its socket, it was so sore.</p> <p>Then Phin and Luc put me through a series of tests to gauge my existing fighting skills. That was one category where I efficiently proved myself. Of course, Phin and Luc were way stronger and faster than I\u2019d ever be.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even out of freaking breath,\u201d I said, breathing hard, keeping my eyes fastened on Luc as he circled me, and waiting for the pounce.</p><p>\u201cCool, huh?\u201d he said, grinning, his handsome face determinedly fixed on mine. \u201cVamp perk.\u201d</p><p>I lifted a brow and inclined my head. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get that headband?\u201d I asked, noting the one keeping his long bangs from falling in his face. \u201cThe eighties?\u201d</p><p>Luc\u2019s expression darkened, and he lifted a hand to his band. \u201cHey, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>With a wide roundhouse kick, I knocked Luc\u2019s feet out from under him and put him right onto his ass. I followed him down and straddled his middle. While his siblings laughed, Luc graciously accepted the fact that I\u2019d gotten the best of him, and he laid there, sprawled out, arms spread wide in submission. \u201cNice move, mortal,\u201d he said, then in one breathless move leapt up, flipped me, and had me flat on my back while he straddled me. He grinned. \u201cDon\u2019t hate the headband.\u201d</p> <p>He jumped up, bent over, and offered a hand up. I took it, then swept his legs with one solid kick and again had Luc on the mat.</p><p>\u201cDude, you might as well give up,\u201d Phin said.</p><p>Luc glanced over at me and grinned. \u201cYou know I\u2019m just fucking with you, right?\u201d he said. \u201cBuilding your esteem.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYeah, whatever.\u201d</p><p>He rolled and got up, and this time I did let him help me stand. I wiped the sweat from my brow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a pretty sick fighter,\u201d Luc said, crossing his arms over his cut, bared chest. \u201cBut let\u2019s add a few obstacles.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cOkay, whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>Luc grinned, and it made me shudder. That made him and Phin laugh.</p> <p>When it came time to add in jumps and rolls and throwing blades while running? God, I needed practice. At least it would keep me busy, and part of my brain thought that was what the whole thing was about anyway: keeping my mind off of Seth. And Eli.</p><p>The real shocker came later that afternoon. \u201cHey, Luc, why don\u2019t you and Phin be moving targets?\u201d Josie said, smiling. \u201cI think that would be wicked cool.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure why it took me by surprise, but it did, and I suppose the alarm was evident on my face.</p><p>\u201cNo, seriously\u2014it\u2019s fine,\u201d Luc said, and flung a practice blade directly at Phin. I watched it sink into his flesh, all the way to the hilt.</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d I hollered when Phin pulled it from his chest, flipped it, and flung it back at Luc. Luc caught it in midair. No blood anywhere, but then vampires don\u2019t bleed their own blood, do they?</p><p>\u201cTotally not real silver, don\u2019t forget,\u201d said Josie, who sat perched on the windowsill, swinging her skinny-jean-clad legs and All Stars. \u201cThe practice blades are sharp, but fake\u2014steel. That\u2019s why they\u2019re practice blades.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at her, then at Eli\u2019s brothers. \u201cThat makes me feel lots better.\u201d</p><p>They all laughed.</p><p>Over the next couple of hours I worked on moving targets, and I was glad not to have a squeamish stomach. It took a little getting used to at first\u2014flinging a sharp blade at a live being, although technically, Luc and Phin weren\u2019t alive. I missed\u2014a lot.</p><p>When Phin laughed at a blade that pinged off the wall, I turned to him. \u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a lot easier hitting still dummies than moving ones.\u201d He merely laughed again.</p><p>Practice was grueling. I had good aim, though, and a steady hand\u2014so said Gilles as he and Elise came to watch, and eventually I hit my mark\u2014Luc and Phin\u2014a few times. Jack and Tuba stood near the door like a couple of bouncers and kept their gazes trained on me. Big and silent, they were in fact intimidating. I\u2019m not convinced they\u2019d be a match for the Dupr\u00e9s, though I\u2019d never confess that to Preacher. Maybe there was a lot more to Gullah magic than I originally thought. Rather, Preacher\u2019s sort of magic. He and his family were definitely unconventional Gullah.</p><p>The last of my first practice day consisted of Luc and Phin tag teaming me while I threw. One would be the moving target; the other would come after me.</p><p>I started running from the back of the room, Luc and Phin flanking me. I aimed my practice blade at Luc and threw, then kept my eyes trained on Phin as he lunged toward me. I ducked, rolled, and hit my feet running, but he was too fast. His body full-impact hit me, and I landed on the mat with a heavy thud. His eyes twinkled down at me with victory. \u201cThis is the most fun I\u2019ve had in a hundred years,\u201d he said with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cGet off me,\u201d I said, struggling to breathe.</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d Luc said.</p><p>I groaned.</p><p>I hit the mat so many times, I lost count. It was a hard workout for me, effortless for the Dupr\u00e9s. They\u2019d crammed all the lessons into one day. Apparently I\u2019d be doing the same every day from here on out. I could barely wait.</p><p>I jogged home from Monterey Square, Phin beside me, and dusk was just approaching. A slight breeze now shifted the moss hanging from the oaks, and I dodged tourists as they window-shopped the myriad antique and specialty stores lining the historic district. We jogged past a walking ghost tour, the tour guide dressed in Colonial wear and swinging a lantern, flashes from the tourists\u2019 digital cameras lighting the darkness as they aimed at various structures. As I ran by, I noticed a horse-drawn carriage with a couple snuggled together, and the woman in the carriage glanced down and smiled at me. The first thought that crossed my mind was, You have no freaking clue what\u2019s really out there, do you? How cynical I\u2019d become. Phin chuckled.</p><p>After a quick shower, I quickly ate a can of SpaghettiOs and changed into something Phin suggested: comfortable, movable clothes. I wasn\u2019t exactly sure what that meant, but I took no chances: a pair of baggy jeans that sat below my hips, a black ribbed tank, and a pair of well-worn Vans. I pulled my hair into a high ponytail, slipped on a belt to keep my baggy pants from falling around my knees, and was ready to go. At least, I thought I was. I was learning real fast to always expect the unexpected. I popped four ibuprofen tabs to keep away the soreness I knew my body would be experiencing\u2014was already starting to feel\u2014from the Dupr\u00e9 workout. It was well after dark when we left, and Luc as well as Josie joined us.</p><p>For the first hour, we simply mingled in the streets with the tourists. Sunday nights were typically slower than the rest of the week, but there were still a good handful who stepped out into the historic district to wallow in Savannah\u2019s atmosphere. I found myself obsessively searching for a crowd of delinquents wearing dark hoodies but never caught the first sight of them. We hit all the main squares, walked Broughton Street east and west, and even strolled through Starbucks. Mullet was in there with his \u00fcbertall girlfriend, and I spoke to them for just a few seconds before leaving.</p><p>It was nearly midnight when we found ourselves in a small alley two blocks over from the Panic Room, and that was when I caught sight of them. Huddled together, they knelt on the sidewalk next to a streetlamp, completely engrossed in . . . something on the ground. Phin grabbed my arm as I moved forward.</p><p>\u201cNo way, Riley,\u201d Phin said, and we all fell into the shadows. \u201cWatch, not approach, or don\u2019t you remember the other night?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him. \u201cYeah, I remember.\u201d Todd could have killed me.</p><p>\u201cThey grow stronger every day,\u201d Josie said beside me. \u201cAnd Seth doesn\u2019t know you anymore.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d already known it\u2014Eli had said as much. But somehow it hit harder now, and it hurt. An ache spread through my chest at the thought of my brother not knowing me. I studied each of the boys and couldn\u2019t determine which one was Seth.</p><p>Just then, one of the boys shifted, and I saw all too clearly what they were so intrigued by: a body. By the size of the chunky black boots I estimated a male; I couldn\u2019t tell whether he was dead. My stomach lurched at the thought, and I wanted to react. No way in hell was I going to sit by and watch as my brother sucked the blood of some dude lying on a dirty sidewalk. I moved, and a hand abruptly stopped me.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t drink the blood of the dead,\u201d Phin said, grasping me with a steely grip. \u201cIt\u2019s lethal for us. That\u2019s why they use dope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo sedate and subdue,\u201d Josie said flatly.</p><p>I felt my face lose what little color it had. \u201cWill they kill him?\u201d I asked, afraid of the answer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Luc said. \u201cThey can\u2019t make their first kill until the quickening is complete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll take him back to the Arcoses, and they\u2019ll kill him,\u201d Josie offered.</p><p>In the next instant, I shifted\u2014barely a movement, from one foot to the other\u2014and one of the boys heard. Several hoodies glanced my way, but one in particular had enough light from the streetlamp illuminating his face for me to get a good look. Seth\u2019s extraordinarily pale face and lightened eyes stared hard at me; blood was running from the side of his mouth. I reacted\u2014I lunged. And Seth lunged back, both of us at the same instant. He was close enough now that I could see the depth of his eyes: crazed, unfamiliar, incoherent\u2014nothing at all remained of the loving, sweet brother he once was. The others stood, glaring; the energy around us snapped, and I knew they were ready to pounce.</p> <p>\u201cShit\u2014get her out of here!\u201d Phin yelled, and Josie grabbed me and yanked so hard I thought my arm had popped the socket. She all but dragged me away, and behind us I could hear the fight that had started. We ran\u2014hard\u2014I had no choice, really. It was run or be dragged. I followed Eli\u2019s sister and rolled beneath a red-tip shrub and into a neighboring yard. The grass was damp and cool with dew, prickly and stiff. We both jumped up, crossed the lane, and started running.</p><p>\u201cYou have to go back and help them,\u201d I said breathlessly. \u201cI\u2019ll go straight home\u2014promise. But seven against two are bad odds\u2014even for a vampire.\u201d</p><p>Josie stopped and stared hard at me. \u201cPromise?\u201d she asked, then frowned. \u201cSwear it.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cSwear it. Now, go,\u201d I said.</p><p>She watched me for a split second longer, gauging her trust of me, no doubt, then took off. I ran in the other direction, toward home. While my gut told me to stay and fight, my brain told me to get the hell out\u2014I was nowhere near capable of handling myself against a newling\u2014much less a group of newlings. It ate at me to run away\u2014it just wasn\u2019t in my nature. But all three Dupr\u00e9s together could fight off Riggs and the others, and my being there would be a total and possibly lethal distraction\u2014to both parties. As I ran hard and fast beneath the streetlamps, my Vans pounding the paved sidewalk, I prayed the Dupr\u00e9s wouldn\u2019t accidentally hurt my brother.</p> <p>I turned at the intersection at Martin Luther King and ran up River Street, the lights and activity at the west end not nearly as heavy as at the east end, but I\u2019d get there soon enough. I hurried up the cobbles, the old Atlantic Paper Company on my left, then past the Hyatt. I crossed over to the river walk, slowing now to a jog. I glanced over my shoulder and didn\u2019t see any hoodies, so I began to walk, out of breath. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder who the victim on the ground was; I\u2019m glad I hadn\u2019t seen his face. I knew I\u2019d never rid my mind of Seth\u2019s pale skin, with blood dripping off his chin; it was too horrific. I felt like screaming at the top of my lungs; I felt like hitting something\u2014I felt sick to my stomach. I started to run again\u2014ran hard. Very few people were out on a Sunday night at midnight\u2014even on River Street, and I had free rein on the walk. I jumped over the short wall barrier and headed to the river. At the section across from Inksomnia, I stopped, leaned over the rail, and threw up. Never, ever would I forget what my brother had looked like, what he\u2019d unknowingly done. I hated this. I hated all of this.</p><p>I stood there grasping the metal railing, breathing hard. The night air was stagnant, the low tide making the scent of the marsh pungent, and the shoals of oysters bubbled and popped across the river from Dafuski Island. The mosquitoes were out in armies, and I slapped my neck as they bit. Damn, I hated mosquitoes. I pushed off the rail and turned to go inside\u2014but gasped and jerked to a halt as I stared straight into the vacant, opaque eyes of my brother.</p><p>I stood frozen in place; my eyes widened and my insides quivered as I stared at Seth. I hated being afraid of my brother, but I was. He almost looked dead, with his skin so pale and translucent, his eyes a completely different shade of green\u2014nearly white now\u2014and his lips a darkish blue. Dried blood streaked his chin. His nostrils flared as his gaze settled on the side of my throat, at my carotid, and I took a step back. With a sound emanating from his throat that no longer sounded human, he moved slowly toward me. Again, I froze, and he stopped. I know he didn\u2019t recognize me, and was pretty sure he\u2019d followed only because he\u2019d caught sight of me. Josie and the others had said more than once Seth wouldn\u2019t remember me or his previous life. Had she been wrong?</p><p>The air tensed around us; Seth and I were both on edge and about to lunge\u2014I could feel it. I slowly eased back a few more steps, until my flesh grazed the rail, and my hands followed, encircling the metal in a tight grip. \u201cSeth,\u201d I said quietly, steadily, my eyes directly on his; hopefully he would concentrate on my face and not my hand movement. I was going to freaking jump in the river if I had to, despite the bull sharks that patrolled the waterways\u2014another thing not mentioned in the tourist mags and brochures. I inhaled slowly, and even that slight movement was noticed by my brother. He flinched and jumped at me. \u201cSeth!\u201d I said, louder, and he jerked as though he\u2019d been struck. His chest rose and fell rapidly, faster than human, and his Adam\u2019s apple bobbed unnaturally\u2014like he was swallowing something rapid-fire, over and over.</p><p>Then his face drew taut and his eyes widened, and in the next second, he lunged for me. In the same breath I threw my legs over the handrail, and before I could drop, Seth\u2019s body just . . . stopped coming at me. I tightened my grasp and held on to the railing, suspended, until my hands started to sweat and my fingers grew cold and numb. Nothing happened. I had no idea whether he stood there, waiting, or . . . what? No more than thirty seconds passed, and I\u2019d decided a swim with the bull sharks was going to be my finale for the night. Then Phin\u2019s face appeared over the rail, and he reached down with one hand, grasped one of mine, and effortlessly hauled me back over. \u201cRiley\u2014what the hell are you doing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I looked at him, then looked around. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do with my brother?\u201d I asked, ignoring his question, still scared but trying to shake it off.</p> <p>In the lamplight, Phin\u2019s flawless pale face, chiseled features accented by the light dusting of scruff on his jaw, all but glowed. Even though he had different colored hair he looked a lot like Eli. He cocked his head. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>I glanced up the river walk, toward the west end. I saw nothing. \u201cI left Josie and ran here, stopped, and barfed over the railing.\u201d I looked at Phin. \u201cWhen I turned around, Seth was right behind me.\u201d I met his gaze. \u201cHe knew me, Phin. I could see it.\u201d</p><p>Phin\u2019s face turned hard. \u201cIn his opaque eyes, you mean? He didn\u2019t recognize you, Riley. Not this far into his quickening.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms over my chest, glanced upward at the more than half-circle moon that slipped in and out of misty clouds, and sighed. \u201cHe did. He lunged at me, and when I called his name\u201d\u2014I looked at him\u2014\u201che flinched. He stopped when he didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Phin rubbed his neck. \u201cThen, where\u2019d he go?\u201d</p><p>Glancing at the place where Seth had just stood, I shrugged. \u201cHe lunged for me, I threw my legs over the railing, and he just . . . disappeared.\u201d I stared up both ends of River Street. \u201cWhat about the guy? Back in the alley?\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Phin grasped my elbow. \u201cDon\u2019t dwell on it, Riley. They took him, probably to the Arcoses. Come on, let\u2019s go,\u201d he said, then mumbled something French beneath his breath. \u201cEli would kick my ass if he knew I let you off alone,\u201d he said to himself, but I\u2019d clearly heard.</p><p>We crossed the cobbles and old trolley rails, gained the sidewalk, and walked to the narrow alley next to my building. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d I asked. I knew it was fake coy, but I didn\u2019t care. I wanted to hear it. We climbed the steep concrete steps to Factor\u2019s Walk, and Phin gave me a sly look.</p> <p>\u201cHe just would,\u201d he answered, and continued to look at me with curiosity. \u201cWhy\u2019d you barf?\u201d I looked at him, and he held up a hand. \u201cAh\u2014never mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said, and fished the key out of my pocket as we mounted the top of the steps and turned down the merchant\u2019s drive. The moment we reached my back door, images of Eli kissing me hard against that very door raged through my mind, and so did everything that followed: his hands, his mouth, his body inside of mine\u2014it overwhelmed me. I found it beyond weird to think I\u2019d known Eli for such a short time. It seemed like years. I wasn\u2019t a virgin; I\u2019d had sex before. That night with Eli wasn\u2019t sex. It was something else that to me had no name, no origin, and obviously something I\u2019d never experienced before\u2014probably never would again. I accepted it as that and pushed everything else out of my brain.</p><p>Chaz barked as soon as he heard me push the key in the lock; he had to go out. Grabbing his leash, we walked him for a few, then headed inside for the rest of the night. I made a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich, and Phin sat on the counter while I ate.</p><p>\u201cMy father says you\u2019ll need to close your business for the last week of the quickening,\u201d he announced. \u201cI was supposed to tell you earlier, but I forgot.\u201d</p><p>I stared, midbite. \u201cNo way.\u201d I bit, then continued to chew. \u201cI\u2019ll take off, but Nyx can run the shop. This is high season for me, and unlike you, I didn\u2019t come from money.\u201d</p><p>Phin smiled. \u201cI confess\u2014that is a pretty sweet deal. But Papa made us each invest\u2014even Josie. We all have our own money.\u201d He smiled. \u201cMicrosoft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a social security card? Driver\u2019s license?\u201d I asked, and took another bite. I chased it with a long gulp of milk from the carton and regarded him. \u201cInsurance on your bike?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said. \u201cWe pay taxes, too.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and rinsed my plate in the sink. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to know how you manage that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Phin just chuckled, hopped off the counter, and flopped onto the sofa. To look at him, or Luc, you\u2019d think they were just a couple of hot young guys without a care in the world. But I\u2019d seen them in action. They were tough-asses to the max.</p><p>\u201cPretty impressive fighting today,\u201d he said as I walked from the room. \u201cSincerely.\u201d</p><p>I turned and grinned. \u201cYeah? You too, Dupr\u00e9. Night.\u201d</p> <p>Phin laughed a total guy laugh, said good night, and flipped on the TV.</p><p>I had to constantly remind myself that he used to suck the blood out of innocent humans.</p><p>After a shower, I left my hair wet, wadded it up high on my head, and wrapped a band around it to keep it in place. I pulled on a cami and a pair of black boy shorts, and sighed. I was sore and exhausted; my mind whirled around seeing my baby brother in his quickening state, and wanting\u2014needing\u2014Eli. It\u2019d shocked me to learn he\u2019d gone to Da Island to get rejuvenated\u2014whatever that exactly meant. It had taken a lot of control for him to walk away from me, and Gilles\u2019 words, or warning, felt heavy in my head. \u2019Twill end badly, ch\u00e8re. Between our kind and mortals, it always does. I crawled into bed, glanced at my closed French doors, and drifted off to sleep with Gilles\u2019 words still ringing in my ears.</p><p>In my slumber, another dream claimed my consciousness, and I found myself in a dark, hazy underground club\u2014I didn\u2019t recognize it, nor did I recognize the patrons. Was it a masquerade party? Halloween? Themed? Everyone was dressed in modified Victorian garb; women\u2019s gowns dipped exceedingly low, revealing heaving breasts and nipples, and slits up the front and back of their flowing skirts exposed their nakedness when they moved. The young men wore dress velvet coats with tails and ruffles, their pants laced in the front but with laces loose and mostly undone; some openly groped themselves as they sucked an exposed breast. A themed orgy? An odd mixture of music played, one of Gregorian monks chanting and the ancient strings of a harpsichord. I glanced down at myself and noticed that I wore the same as the others; my breasts and nipples were also exposed, and I had no panties beneath my skirts. No one seemed to notice me, and I eased away from the corner I was standing in and moved along the edges of the crowd, seeking an exit, covering myself with my arms folded over my chest. I had no idea why I was there, only that I wanted to escape.</p><p>Then he was suddenly blocking my path; I knew I\u2019d seen him before but didn\u2019t know his name. He was not Eli. A black-haired woman was at his side, her face hidden in his shoulder, her fingers entwined in the laces of his breeches, fondling. The man was flawless and beautiful; his gaze raked over my body, and wherever it lingered, my skin burned, tingled with desire. His hand lifted to the woman beside him, and he grazed a thumb over her hardened nipple; I felt it and gasped with pleasure. A smile tipped his sensual mouth, and he leaned to the woman and whispered; I heard it. He said, \u201cStroke me.\u201d The woman\u2019s hand slipped inside his breeches and palmed him, moving slightly up, then down; I felt it, too, hard and sleek in my hand. His gaze never left mine, and I hated how excited he made me. I wanted to escape; I was powerless to move. He whispered to the woman, \u201cTaste me.\u201d With her back to me she knelt before him, freed him, pulled it into her mouth; I felt it in mine, and I grew wet between my legs as I watched her head bob against him. He stared at me with a gaze so intense and powerful, I hadn\u2019t the ability to move, and he smiled seductively at me, and whispered, \u201cYou look good enough to fuck,\u201d and then licked his lips, sending me into a breathless orgasm; then his eyes rolled back as he found his. I hated him; I wanted to be closer to him. It was then that the woman shifted, exposing a piece of bared back. At the same time I recognized my dragon tattoo, she turned and looked at me, smiling as she delicately wiped her mouth with the tip of her finger. The woman was me. All of the other patrons stopped their orgy at once to look at me. I blinked, and their faces contorted into those of monsters, their teeth jagged and gnashing from unhinged, exaggerated jaws, and they lunged at me. Terror gripped me, and I began to run, faster, and everything became barren and bleak. And suddenly I was no longer at a Victorian orgy but in a heavily wooded forest filled with long shadows and darkness. I was being hunted. . . .</p> <p>\u201cRiley!\u201d</p><p>As my name being said out loud made it through the webby edges of the dream, I gasped and lunged forward, and steely hands were there to catch me. My heart pounded mercilessly, and I was breathless, grasping onto . . . someone. At first, I thought it was Eli. It was still dark, but I soon realized it was Phin.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Phin said, trying to comfort me by patting my back. \u201cSlow down, girl. What\u2019s wrong with you? You\u2019re gonna have a freaking heart attack.\u201d He pulled the sheet that I\u2019d kicked out of to cover up my lower half.</p><p>\u201cBad dream,\u201d I said, and suddenly felt a wash of weakness overcome me. I fell back onto my pillow. It was just like before\u2014I had no energy.</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt always helps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, my heart slowing, and I closed my eyes. \u201cBut you don\u2019t wanna know.\u201d I didn\u2019t even want to know, but unfortunately I did. I remembered it all. And it was freaky-weird. Who was that guy? I wasn\u2019t into orgies, and I\u2019d never been to one. Why in hell would I not only dream of one, but get off from it? Nasty, Poe. Just freaking nasty.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to sleep with this shut and locked,\u201d Phin said, and when I looked he\u2019d moved and was closing the French doors.</p><p>\u201cI closed and locked those before I went to sleep,\u201d I told him, and he looked skeptically at me. \u201cSwear to God.\u201d</p><p>Phin latched the doors and sat at the foot of my bed, rubbing his neck. \u201cThat,\u201d he said, \u201cis not good.\u201d He cocked his head. \u201cWhat was the dream about, Riley?\u201d</p><p>I cracked my eyes and looked at him in the shadowy light.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me go in there and get the info myself,\u201d he said, pointing to my head.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cFine. But don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. It\u2019s freaky. And it\u2019s not the first one I\u2019ve had.\u201d When he lifted a brow, I continued. \u201cThey\u2019re just . . . weird sexual dreams. Ones where an amazingly hot guy can make me . . . you know?\u201d Phin lifted the other brow up. \u201cYeah, that. Well, he can do that without touching me.\u201d I put my hands over my eyes. \u201cGod, Phin\u2014do I really have to give any more detail?\u201d I wasn\u2019t shy, but some things were personal. \u201cI don\u2019t think a porn dream is something you need to know about.\u201d</p><p>He stroked his chin. \u201cUh, yeah. I think you should tell me every sordid detail of both dreams. Don\u2019t leave anything out. Sincerely.\u201d He leaned forward like a freaking psychiatrist, imaginary notepad and pen in hand. He gave a slight nod. \u201cYou may begin.\u201d</p><p>I threw a pillow at him. \u201cGet out of my room, pervert. I need more sleep.\u201d</p> <p>He regarded me, then rose and left the room. \u201cI\u2019ll be in here if you need me.\u201d I heard him chuckling at himself in the living room. A vampire with a sense of humor. Sweet.</p><p>The rest of the night went by without incident; no more funky erotic dreams, no further opening of locked doors, and so on, and I carried on my usual Monday-morning routine. Nyx was hopping around like a little prairie dog when Phin and I walked in to Inksomnia, and she wanted an update on Seth.</p><p>Nyx pulled me into a tight, squeezing hug, then looked at me. \u201cRiley, how much longer does Seth have to be out there?\u201d she asked, and guilt gnawed at me for telling my best friend a lie. She adored Seth, and I knew she was going through a tough time with his supposed drug rehabilitation. If she knew what was really happening\u2014no, she\u2019d never be able to handle it. Not Nyx. I met her gaze with what I hoped was a reassuring one. \u201cHe\u2019ll be home soon, Nyx. We don\u2019t want him flying through rehab and getting out too early, do we?\u201d I hugged her back. \u201cTrust me\u2014I want this to be his last terrible experience. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m going out to Da Island to be with him.\u201d</p><p>Nyx\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a couple of days. I need to call and reschedule several appointments today.\u201d I looked at her and cocked my head. \u201cCan you handle the shop alone? Oh\u2014and would you take Chaz? If it\u2019s a problem, then Estelle and Preacher\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nyx gave me her signature thumbs-up. \u201cOf course I will, on all accounts! No prob.\u201d She smiled, talking with her hands as she did when excited. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re going to be with your little man. He needs you now more than ever.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time, unfortunately. \u201cI really miss him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, then smiled through her worry. \u201cSo do I. And you\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201d She began to set up. \u201cSo where\u2019s Eli?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, but inside my gut wrenched at the sound of his name. \u201cHe\u2019s around. Maybe he\u2019ll drop in soon. Until then,\u201d I said, distracting her from Eli, \u201chow \u2019bout showing his brother the ropes? They\u2019ve all sort of taken an interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure!\u201d she said, and waved Phin toward her. \u201cCome on. There\u2019s a lot to learn about . . . ink!\u201d</p><p>The day progressed more slowly than any I\u2019d experienced over the past couple of weeks. I made tons of calls to clients to reschedule inking appointments for the following two weeks, and only one out of twenty-two decided to use another artist. I spent the rest of the day ordering Nyx enough stock so she wouldn\u2019t have to handle it and the ink jobs. Plus I did a few inks myself, and I tried to put my personal hell aside long enough to do good-quality artwork. It wasn\u2019t easy, but I managed it. Inksomnia had been my passion, my savior after I\u2019d managed to get a decent life going once Preacher and his family scoured the drugs and idiocy from my system. Now? My heart just wasn\u2019t into it. Knowing Seth was experiencing some freakish ancient vampiric quickening and fast turning into a vicious killer sort of put a hold on the rest of my life. I loved that kid more than anything, and I would die to make things right again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At six o\u2019clock, Nyx flipped on the flat screen in the sitting area; she always wanted to find out what was happening in the low country. Me? Too depressing, so I avoided it. Until today, when the desperate plea of a woman\u2019s voice blasted across the shop. I crossed the room and watched with Nyx, and my heart dropped.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d the woman sobbed, and sagged against a man\u2014I assumed her husband. \u201cIf anyone has seen Jared, please\u2014I . . . just want my son back.\u201d The camera flashed to the reporter, who described Jared Porter as sixteen years old, five feet seven inches, approximately one hundred and forty pounds, with short blond hair and brown eyes. A picture of him flashed across the Crime Stoppers screen, and my insides went icy. Jared had been missing now for almost a week and was last seen around eleven p.m. leaving River Street with his friends.</p><p>\u201cThat poor mother,\u201d Nyx said, shaking her head. \u201cIt must be so awful.\u201d</p> <p>I had no doubt that Jared Porter had joined Seth and the others. It made me angry and more determined than ever to bring those bastards down.</p><p>Nyx helped me close shop, then headed out to Wilmington Island to have dinner with her parents. Luc and Josie had come in just as Phin and I headed upstairs. I quickly showered and dressed\u2014this time with Josie digging through my closet. She reminded me of a little sister, and I had to give it to the kid\u2014she had rockin\u2019 taste. She pulled out a pair of ripped skinny jeans and a black tank with a spiderweb tattoo design on the back.</p><p>\u201cSweet,\u201d she said, and handed them both to me. \u201cI wish I could go,\u201d she said, pouting. She pulled my hair into a funky half-up, half-down sort of do, with my bangs long and free. \u201cBut Papa said I should just let the boys go with you for now.\u201d She looked at me, her brows pulled together. She glanced at my chest, then back to me. \u201cI wish I\u2019d been a little older when Papa changed me.\u201d She looked down at herself. \u201cI\u2019ll never have boobs like you. I\u2019m flat chested forever. It sucks.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI know it seems like it sucks,\u201d I said, and then flushed when I remembered Eli\u2019s words. I inclined my head. \u201cBut boobs are more trouble than they\u2019re worth sometimes anyway. I have a hard time fitting into clothes sometimes. Pain in the ass.\u201d I grinned. \u201cTell ya what. Why don\u2019t you pick out a choker? I\u2019ve got a hundred of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool, thanks!\u201d she said, and dove back into the plundering. \u201cAny of them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said, then grabbed my navy All Stars and headed into the living room. \u201cReady?\u201d I said to Luc and Phin, both standing near the window looking out. They turned, and I gotta say\u2014it\u2019s one thing when you get a reaction from a regular dude that they think you look hot. It\u2019s another experience altogether when it\u2019s a pair of century-plus-old vampires ogling. I shamelessly confess to liking the ego being boosted a little.</p><p>\u201cDamn, Riley,\u201d Luc said, looking more like a wolf than a vamp.</p><p>\u201cDouble damn,\u201d said Phin, and he grinned at me. He was remembering my dreams, although I never did go into detail. I didn\u2019t have to. I\u2019m sure he slipped into my thoughts. I could so tell.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cPervs. It\u2019s just jeans and a tank. Let\u2019s go. And I\u2019m driving.\u201d I glanced at them both appreciatively. Luc had on a pair of frayed jeans and a black formfitting tee with black boots. Phin wore a pair of black slim-fit jeans with a chain hanging from the pocket, a pair of black All Stars, and a gray long-sleeved mesh shirt. \u201cPretty hot yourselves, by the way,\u201d I said, and headed to the door. I scrubbed Chaz on the head\u2014Josie had taken him out earlier\u2014and the Dupr\u00e9s followed me out.</p><p>We dropped Josie off in front of the Dupr\u00e9 House and made our way over to Martin Luther King. The plan was to hit the Panic Room, followed by a trip to the Morgue\u2014another dark alternative club. If there was time, we\u2019d hit one more: the Asylum. God, I hadn\u2019t gone to any of those in quite a while. But Seth and the others would be hanging around the darker clubs for\u2014I hated to say it\u2014victims. So I had to put my fears aside despite my reservations. It hadn\u2019t been easy giving them up, but once I had, I was done. I\u2019d figured that if I was going to get clean and straighten my life out, and give Seth a good life, then I needed to cut clean of all things that would be a temptation to me. Now, some people, like Mullet? They went for the sheer fun of loud, head-bangin\u2019 music, dance, and drink. I\u2019d started out that way, but I became something else\u2014a big-time clubber, long before reaching legal age, who couldn\u2019t assert self-control. I didn\u2019t even have the desire to go anymore. Weird.</p><p>The night air whisked through my opened Jeep as we cruised up Martin Luther King and turned down Williamson. I parked a street over, closer to the River Street side, and we got out. Much to the surprise of both Dupr\u00e9s, I tucked some bills into my bra, and my Jeep key in my pocket. I then gave Luc and Phin a heads-up on Zetty.</p> <p>Just before we got to the entrance, Phin stopped me. His look was grave. \u201cPreacher told us about, you know\u2014when you were young. If it gets too much in here for you, just say the word.\u201d</p><p>I gave Phin a smile. He really was one considerate vampire. \u201cNo prob. That habit left my body once the Gullah washed it out of me. But thanks for some good lookin\u2019 out.\u201d</p><p>Zetty greeted me the same as the other night, and greeted Luc and Phin with his hand resting on his trusty traditional Tibetan blade. His eyes followed us all the way inside.</p><p>Luc and Phin simply looked at each other and shrugged.</p><p>The moment we pushed through the doors, \u201cBad Company\u201d by Five Finger Death Punch was pounding through the surround sound, and the familiar, sickening scent of smoke and liquor tinged with body sweat and pot hit us in the face. I knew Kelter would find me. It was like he could smell me, which really freaked me out. Luc went to the bar to order me a drink, while Phin and I melded into the throng of people dancing\u2014or doing whatever it was they were doing.</p><p>I moved to the music, and Phin stayed close. I leaned in. \u201cPretty good moves for an old guy,\u201d I said in his ear, and he laughed. While he seemed to be a free-willed young dude dancing with a crazy chick, I knew how serious he was taking this issue with the Arcoses. While he laughed, his gaze raked the crowds, searching for any of the boys with Riggs and Seth. Every once in a while I caught a glimpse of something dark in his eyes that was . . . beyond frightening. I\u2019d seen it in Eli\u2019s eyes, too. They were not to be underestimated. That much I knew.</p><p>We danced for a few more minutes, then made our way to the bar. \u201cWe\u2019re going to leave you alone, but we\u2019ll be close,\u201d Phin said. \u201cAll you have to do is think me to you, and I\u2019ll come.\u201d I nodded, and he and Luc moved away. The black walls and strobe lights made the inside of the Panic Room surreal and dreamlike, and to me it was no surprise how so many people lost themselves. It wasn\u2019t the club\u2019s fault\u2014the music rocked, and people drank in clubs every day and didn\u2019t get screwed up. It was the fault of scumbags like Kelter, who added that little extra something that made innocent lives go to straight to hell, becoming completely submerged in the darkest dregs.</p><p>After almost forty minutes, there were no signs of Riggs, Seth, or any of the other boys, and Kelter hadn\u2019t shown up. I decided to take a walk to the back of the club to see whether I noticed anything unusual. I eased away from the bar and moved into the crowd.</p> <p>If I\u2019d had a buck for every stray hand that felt my ass in the four minutes it took me to get to the horseshoe, I\u2019d be filthy rich. But to find the body those hands belonged to would have taken a CSI team. Everyone looked as guilty as hell. Freaky-guilty, male and female alike. So I squelched my desire to knock the hell out of every potential ass grabber and hurried through the crowd. Once in the horseshoe, I made a beeline for the office doors, weaving through a line at the women\u2019s restroom and the usual couples pawing each other against the wall. I tried the doors, found them locked, and turned to leave but stopped abruptly. A girl stood directly behind me. Almost as tall as me, with platinum blond hair streaked with black and purple that hung to her waist, and dressed head to toe in black leather, she glared at me with kohl-rimmed eyes. She was maybe all of eighteen.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for Kelter, he\u2019s not here,\u201d she said sharply, and inspected me critically from the tips of my boots to the top of my head. Disgust crossed her face. \u201cI saw you here the other night with him,\u201d she said, and lifted a cigarette to her lips and pulled. She blew smoke in my face and leaned close. \u201cBack off, whore,\u201d she whispered, and her breath smelled like stale beer and cigarettes. \u201cKelter\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>I nearly choked. Not on the smoke but because I couldn\u2019t believe that anyone would purposely want Kelter Phillips. It was freaking hilarious. I gave her a slight grin, although I really felt sorry for her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014I don\u2019t want him anyway.\u201d I pushed past her and left, and I found I couldn\u2019t get out of the Panic Room fast enough. Her eyes shot daggers at me the whole way out\u2014I could feel them ricocheting off my back.</p><p>Phin and Luc met me in the middle and guided me to the exit. Zetty stared at me as we left and gave me a single nod. He held the door as we passed through, and closed it firmly behind us.</p><p>\u201cCheerful dude,\u201d Luc said. \u201cNo gains there tonight. On to our next destination.\u201d</p><p>Outside, the air had grown heavy, muggier than earlier, and very, very still. We climbed into the Jeep and pulled out onto MLK. \u201cThe Morgue,\u201d I supplied, and within fifteen minutes we were pulling into the parking garage on Drayton and walking down the narrow alleyway to the entrance. Again\u2014this wasn\u2019t the sort of place listed under \u201cNightlife\u201d in the travel brochures for Savannah. Inside, the Morgue was home to a rougher class of partiers; gangs that liked to call themselves Vamp-Goths dominated the club, male and female alike, and only the nonsqueamish, extremely confident\u2014or crazy\u2014dared make an entrance. I knew some of them, and they were pretty freaking cool\u2014I had probably inked most of them. Others were just wannabes, dressing the part and making a lot of noise to get attention. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder whether any of them really believed vampires truly existed. Or was it just the idea? The portrayal? If they did, I\u2019d bet my ink shop none of them thought they were anything like the Dupr\u00e9s. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Unlike the Panic Room, the Morgue was under new ownership; it prevented me from having an in\u2014and part of me felt thankful. One Kelter was all I could handle. I suppose I didn\u2019t need an in anyway. The club was dark and thumping. I stepped through a veil of smoke and moved through the crowd to a vacant spot near the wall. Phin rounded on me and lowered his head to my ear.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll spread out and see if we spot any of the hoodies,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s give it forty minutes, tops. Then we\u2019re out.\u201d The look he gave me was grave. \u201cIf you need me, just think it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said, and watched the Dupr\u00e9 brothers split up and disappear into the crowd. For a Monday night, it was a heavy mix. People were jammed into the Morgue like sardines, and as I edged the perimeter I scanned the clubbers and began to weave into the center. The dark interior and flashing lights made it pretty difficult to see any sort of distance, so I moved in and out of the dancers and fought off several groping hands, my sights set on the opposite side of the club. A hand to my crotch\u2014yes, my crotch\u2014stopped me abruptly, and I reacted. I grabbed the wrist taking privileges and yanked upward, and I separated the offender from the tightly knit group of people around me. A young guy, maybe nineteen or twenty, with burred black-dyed hair and a silver mesh sleeveless shirt stared at me with cold, almost black eyes. The side of his neck was inked with a massive wad of barbed wire; in the center was a naked woman, clinging to the wire, a look of terror\u2014or ecstasy, I couldn\u2019t tell which\u2014on her face. It was a shoddy art job, in my opinion.</p> <p>The guy pushed toward me, his face close. \u201cI know what you want,\u201d he said in what he probably thought was a seductive, turn-me-on, throaty voice.</p><p>I dropped his arm. \u201cI doubt it,\u201d I said, and turned away. \u201cFreaking perv.\u201d</p><p>From behind, he pressed into me and grabbed my hips to hold me in place.</p><p>\u201cI mean, I know who you\u2019re looking for,\u201d he said against my ear, and then a hot wetness crept over my lobe as he licked it.</p><p>I stopped and looked at him over my shoulder. \u201cIs that right?\u201d I said, repulsed but hiding it. \u201cAnd what exactly do you know?\u201d Maybe he\u2019d seen Seth or one of the boys. It was worth checking out.</p> <p>\u201cThis way, babe,\u201d he said, and nudged me forward through the crowd; the whole time, his hands stayed gripping my hips. \u201cHands off,\u201d I growled, and he laughed but removed his hands. As we moved, I continued to search faces, but no one seemed familiar\u2014not even Phin or Luc appeared. Finally, we broke free, and when we did the guy totally took me off guard and shoved me against the exit door. In the next second he was pressed against me and we were falling through the door, into the alley. With a heavily booted foot he kicked the door closed behind us and was on me, my front slammed into the bumpy painted concrete of the building, and this guy was grinding his hard crotch against me, mouth buried against my neck, one hand feeling my breasts, the other one groping my crotch. \u201cIt\u2019s me you\u2019re lookin\u2019 for, right?\u201d he said, grunting in my ear.</p><p>Oh, Poe. You dumbass.</p><p>\u201cWrong,\u201d I ground out, and he merely laughed. He had me pinned pretty good, but I was a tall girl, strong and athletic; I pulled my legs up while he sucked on my neck, wedged the balls of my feet against the wall, and pushed hard. We both fell back, and I leapt up. Before he could get off his ass, I\u2019d kicked him in the jaw, and his head jerked back; he spit blood from his mouth. \u201cBitch,\u201d he growled, and spit again. \u201cStupid bitch.\u201d</p><p>Adrenaline must have kicked in, because he jumped up like a cat and lunged for me. He never made it. A figure moved so fast from the shadows and grabbed him by the throat that my brain hardly had time to process it. I watched the perv\u2019s body fly against the Dumpster and hit with a heavy thud. In the next second, Eli emerged from the darkness, his face a mask of fury, his eyes lightened but not yet opaque. He moved closer but did not touch me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing, Riley?\u201d he said, his voice dark, angered, shaking with rage. \u201cWhat?\u201d Those light eyes regarded me, held me captive. I couldn\u2019t have looked away if I\u2019d tried. Thankfully, he did. He grasped his neck with both hands and looked skyward. \u201cTu me fais mourir,\u201d he muttered in French, and of course I had no idea what it meant. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me,\u201d he clarified, and then drew a deep breath and looked at me. \u201cYou. Are. Freaking. Killing. Me.\u201d</p><p>I glanced toward the Dumpster. The perv hadn\u2019t budged. \u201cYou didn\u2019t kill him, did you?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>Eli\u2019s face became even more infuriated. \u201cNo. But I should.\u201d</p><p>I would be lying if I said my heart wasn\u2019t soaring at seeing Eli. It\u2019d only been two days, but it\u2019d felt like forever. Pretty mushy coming from me, and I can promise you\u2014it took some getting used to. I didn\u2019t want to care about him. It made zero sense and made everything much more complicated\u2014especially since Gilles had pretty much given me fair warning to back off.</p><p>\u201cHe did what?\u201d Eli asked, moving closer.</p><p>I turned my back and headed for the door. \u201cOh my God, Eli\u2014stay out of my head.\u201d No sooner did my hand grasp the metal than Eli was behind me, stopping me, and the memory of our night together, with him crowding my body like he was now, made my head swim, my senses heightened. My heart raced at the thought of him touching me, and my breath quickened at how he had touched me. I didn\u2019t dare move.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I left, Riley,\u201d he said, close to my ear. \u201cI had no choice.\u201d</p><p>I made myself breathe, and steady my voice. \u201cYeah. I know.\u201d</p><p>Just then, Phin entered the alley from the street side; he cast a quick glance at the guy lying against the yellow Dumpster and stared at me. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI had it. Besides\u2014he led me to believe he knew who I was looking for. I thought it was worth a shot to check out.\u201d</p> <p>Phin rolled his eyes and threw his hands up. Yes. A vampire rolled his eyes. \u201cNever do that again. Besides\u2014we just spotted three of the kids.\u201d Phin glanced at Eli. \u201cThey were with a new kid\u2014a little older, but not more than eighteen. A total badass. They\u2019re headed down to the river. Lots of warehouses down there. Luc\u2019s on them.\u201d His gaze returned to Eli. \u201cLots of gangs hang out down there, too. Glad you\u2019re back.\u201d He slapped his arm.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s go, then,\u201d I said, and turned up the alley. A steely grip stopped me, and I turned to stare at Eli. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, hiding the thrill that shot through my arm at his touch. He couldn\u2019t possibly read every thought I had.</p><p>\u201cYou stay with me,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>I could tell there\u2019d be no arguing, despite the fact that being close to him made me want him all the more. I\u2019d have to get over it and deal. \u201cFine,\u201d I answered. \u201cThen, move your ass. I want to see where my brother\u2019s been hanging out.\u201d</p><p>Eli stood there, his face unreadable, and stared. It certainly would be nice to have that mind-reading ability, because he was like a stonewalling poker player. I had no idea what he was thinking. Might be a good thing, now that I thought about it.</p><p>\u201cOh-kay,\u201d Phin said sarcastically. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>We moved through the shady treelined streets of the historic district, past tourists and locals, then slipped through a chain-link fence into the dregs of the industrial riverfront. Two older guys sat near the river, the embers of their cigarettes dotting the blackness with an occasional orange glow. As we edged closer, they turned their heads and stared but kept to themselves. Probably homeless and harmless. Phin slowed and reached into his pocket, grabbed his vibrating cell, and read the text. \u201cLuc says it\u2019s three warehouses down from here. Nine kids in all including the three that just left the Morgue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf all nine complete the quickening, we\u2019ll have a large vampire problem on our hands,\u201d I whispered. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not all in the same phase,\u201d Eli said. \u201cBut it\u2019s still a problem. Big problem. Their tendencies grow each day, and the last time I faced your brother\u2019s friend, he was damn strong. And fast.\u201d</p><p>We crossed a patch of soggy, stinky sod that smelled more like rotting sea creatures than the marsh, and edged close to the building. Yeah, an empty warehouse. Just like in the movies. Nothing good ever came from an empty warehouse.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Luc,\u201d Phin said, and we made our way to where he was standing. A row of dirty windows stretched from one end of the metal building to the other, and a flicker of light came from an old metal barrel. When I neared the window to get a better look, Eli pulled me back and pinned me behind him. I frowned at his back and knew it\u2019d do no good to try to force my way around him. It\u2019d just cause unneeded noise.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here,\u201d Eli said under his voice. \u201cArcoses. I can sense them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t before,\u201d Luc said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense them, and my sense of . . . sense is better than yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Phin said. \u201cEli\u2019s right\u2014they\u2019re here now. They\u2019re weak, but their vigor has improved. Greatly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFourteen now, not nine,\u201d Luc said, peering into the window. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Eli glanced at me. \u201cHow many were at the cemetery that night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour, including my brother,\u201d I supplied. \u201cAnd there\u2019s fourteen now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve. Two in there are the Arcoses,\u201d Eli said. He craned his neck around, then looked at his brothers. \u201cNot good.\u201d</p><p>A man\u2019s scream broke the silence.</p><p>I leapt at the window to see what had happened; that scream was the kind that speared your soul; I could feel it inside me. He was terrified. Eli pulled me back.</p><p>\u201cRiley, don\u2019t,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>Part of me\u2014obviously the sick part\u2014wanted to see. I wanted to know what kind of hell I was dealing with. I tried to pull out of Eli\u2019s arms, but he held fast. He moved his face close to mine, his eyes pinning me with a dark glare. \u201cI said no.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I again struggled. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something!\u201d I hissed.</p><p>Eli\u2019s fingers tightened around my arms. \u201cI said, it\u2019s too late.\u201d When I jerked again, his face grew angry. \u201cDo you really want to see, Riley?\u201d He shook me. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I said furiously under my breath. \u201cI do.\u201d</p> <p>In a move that nearly made my head rush, Eli spun me around. Through the hazy glass and firelight from the barrel I could vaguely make out three guys\u2014bigger than the rest. Two held the struggling a man, and one had his mouth planted at the guy\u2019s throat. The man\u2019s legs twitched and kicked as he tried to break free; the others\u2014the kids\u2014watched. Then, even from the distance I stood away, I watched as the attacker\u2019s face contorted, long fangs dropped from his mouth and he snatched the struggling man away from the other one who held him and tore into him like a rabid dog. First his throat. Then his chest. The man\u2019s screams died in a drowning gurgle, and I almost gagged. My mouth went dry; I hadn\u2019t even realized I\u2019d started to shake until Eli forced me away from the window. So much blood . . .</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d Phin said.</p><p>All the strength had drained from my body; I\u2019d never felt so weak and helpless in my entire life\u2014except once, and that was the day I\u2019d found my mother murdered. I remember holding her in my arms, shaking her hard, yelling at her to wake up. I didn\u2019t like the memories. I hated this. But Christ Almighty, there\u2019d been blood everywhere. That guy never had a chance. And Seth was in the midst of it.</p><p>I was silent as Eli and I walked back to the parking garage. Without asking, Eli took the wheel and drove. Luc and Phin stayed behind to watch the boys, and that comforted me very little. My mind rushed around in myriad directions; I wanted to be furious, pissed off and ready to kill. But I was scared. Scared shitless. What they\u2019d done to that man . . .</p><p>I leaned my head against the seat as we drove through town, and the city I once loved didn\u2019t look the same anymore. Everything looked darker, menacing, uninviting. Rather, inviting death. The Spanish moss that I\u2019d always loved hung limp and lifeless; every shadowy alcove and alley, every intricately carved piece of black wrought iron beckoned evil, and behind my closed lids I could envision it happening all over again. Seth\u2019s face flashed before me, and just that fast he transformed, and sunk his mouth into the throat of a stranger. I pushed the pads of my fingers into my eye sockets hard, trying to rid myself of the sight. It wouldn\u2019t go away.</p> <p>\u201cRiley,\u201d Eli said, and in the next breath his hand was on my thigh. I wanted it there; I didn\u2019t want it there. I wanted more; I\u2019d get nothing. I was a loser in this, no matter how I looked at it. My brother would have . . . tendencies, and only if the Arcoses could be destroyed and the boys taken to Da Island for rehab. My mind, though, would never forget what I saw. Never.</p><p>I barely noticed when Eli passed Bay Street, and thought nothing when he turned onto Victory. I had no idea where he was headed, and frankly, I didn\u2019t care. The balmy wind swept over me as we drove, and I closed my eyes to try to block the visions invading my brain. It didn\u2019t help.</p><p>Then Eli reached over, laced his fingers through mine, and held my hand, and the simple gesture comforted me. I opened my eyes and turned my head to find him already looking at me, and that comforted me, too. When he moved his gaze back to the road, I continued to watch him. His profile was so perfect, his hair blowing sexily against his jaw, his forehead, catching on sensually arched lips that worked magic against my body. Somehow, it made me calm. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look at me, but he smiled. \u201cEver been to the lighthouse?\u201d</p><p>I laughed and shook my head. \u201cI grew up here. Of course I\u2019ve been. Why?\u201d</p><p>He laughed a total guy laugh and glanced at me. \u201cWere you born a smart-ass, or did that fine quality just develop over the years?\u201d</p> <p>I smiled. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>Eli chuckled and continued driving. When we reached Tybee he pulled into the vacant parking lot next to the lighthouse. At this time of night, the shore was empty, and I preferred it that way. He cut the engine and we sat for a moment, the surf pounding the sand, the wind ringing through the night. Stars studded the black sky, and the moon hung, a half circle, above the water. Sea oats rustled in the breeze.</p><p>Almost a perfect night, the exception being the vicious bloodsuckers taking over the city.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not going to take over the city,\u201d Eli said, taking liberties with my thoughts. He turned in his seat to look at me. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t let anything happen to you, Riley.\u201d</p><p>I laughed softly, cynically. \u201cIt\u2019s not me I\u2019m worried about, Eli, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>In the amount of time it took me to blink, he was out of the Jeep and standing at my door. Silently he opened it, clicked my seat belt, and pulled me out. With little force he urged me back against the fender and placed a hand on either side of my body, trapping me. For several seconds he regarded me, searched my face.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know it,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou make sure everyone knows how tough you are, all the time.\u201d With one hand he grasped my jaw and dropped his head closer to me. \u201cYou\u2019re a fragile human, Riley,\u201d he said, his hand sliding to my throat. \u201cSo fragile, so delicate, so easy to kill.\u201d His grip tightened. \u201cWhen are you going to get that through your thick skull?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, my gaze unwavering. Instead, the unavoidable happened\u2014something I hated; something that seemed to happen more and more since I\u2019d met Eli Dupr\u00e9. Tears formed in my eyes and rolled down my cheeks. I lifted my chin. \u201cNever,\u201d I said, my voice cracking, determined.</p> <p>Something flared in Eli\u2019s eyes, and then they softened. His hand loosened and slid from my throat upward, his fingers threading into my hair, and he leaned his forehead against mine. I breathed in his scent, unique, sweet, and earthy, and slipped my arms around his waist.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let anything happen to you,\u201d he whispered against my ear. \u201cYou\u2019ve become too important to me, Riley.\u201d He pulled back and looked at me, his eyes dark pools in the shadows. \u201cUnderstand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I whispered, and I didn\u2019t.\u201cBut if you think I\u2019m going to cower in some corner while my brother experiences the quickening, you\u2019re crazy. I promise to be careful.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s features tightened, his jaw flinched, and he sighed, as though he was holding something back and it was not something he wished to discuss. He stared at me for several seconds, then inclined his head toward the lighthouse. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t ask how Eli had a key to the lighthouse; I just followed him inside. He grabbed my hand and led me across the shadowy interior. \u201cI was just a ways up the shore when they installed the first Fresnel lens,\u201d he said. \u201cPretty cool. Always did like lighthouses. They fascinate me.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cI keep forgetting you\u2019re so old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d he said.</p><p>We made it to the steps. \u201cI\u2019d race you, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019d cheat and use your vamp powers to beat me,\u201d I said, then craned my neck and peered above me at the steps as they spiraled upward. \u201cSeth and I used to race them all the time. One hundred and seventy-eight steps to the top.\u201d I laughed, but it was with sadness. \u201cHe always got such a kick out of it.\u201d I felt the beginning of panic seize me once more, and again, Eli was there to rescue me.</p><p>\u201cWrap your legs around my waist,\u201d he said, moving close. \u201cAnd hold on.\u201d</p><p>I did, and slipped my arms around his neck. We were face-to-face, body to body, and sensations soared within me. Eli read my mind and lowered his mouth to mine and kissed me, a long, gentle, sensual kiss that had my head spinning. He tasted sweet, just like his scent, and I knew it wasn\u2019t anything like a mortal scent. It was a scent only a creature of the afterlight could possess. And Eli possessed it fully.</p><p>With a sensual pull of my lips into his mouth, and a sweep of his tongue, Eli ended the kiss and took the one hundred and seventy-eight steps to the top in seven. Yeah, seven. Traveling that fast while hanging on to someone, in a spiral staircase? It was better than any amusement park ride I\u2019d ever been on. My head spun, adrenaline pumped, and somehow, my sexual desire for Eli tripled. Quadrupled.</p><p>At the top, Eli lowered me onto the platform and eased open the door that led to the outer balcony. The wind was wicked strong, salty, and . . . perfect. Without a word, he shut the door behind us and urged me to the rail, where he crowded behind me and placed his arms on either side of me. I admit\u2014I liked the feeling of being trapped by Eli\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he whispered against my ear. \u201cGet used to it.\u201d</p><p>A shiver shot through my body, and I looked out over the darkened Atlantic. Several lights blinked from the fishing boats off the sound, and the glow from the moon rippled steadily over the water. Somewhere close, an oyster shoal bubbled, and the wind carried the ever-present brine to my nostrils.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s strange to think we\u2019ve shared this place,\u201d Eli said, sliding his hands over my waist. His mouth sought the tender area of skin beneath my ear\u2014something that should have had me on guard since he was a vampire, but it didn\u2019t. He had the ability to make me forget all of it. \u201cThe two of us, in the same city but totally different worlds,\u201d he whispered. He turned me around, my back to the rail, and looked down at me. Moonlight flashed off his eyes. \u201cSame world now.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t have to wait for his mouth to descend upon mine; it happened instantly, and the burning desire his touch created felt just as new as the first time he\u2019d ever sensually laid a hand, or his tongue, on me. My skin heated under his touch, and sensations rocked me as his tongue tasted, his teeth nipped, and he suckled my bottom lip as his hands swept over my back, cupped my ass, and pulled me against him. I kissed him back, lost in the atmosphere and in Eli, and as I slipped my hands beneath his shirt and caressed the ridges of his abs, he gasped against my mouth. With his fingers buried in my hair, he held my head still and looked at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI thought I could bring you out here, talk to you, comfort you,\u201d he said, his voice strained. He leaned closer. \u201cBut all I can think of is being inside of you.\u201d He kissed me, dragged his lips across my jaw, then back. \u201cAnd staying inside of you,\u201d he whispered against my lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m comforted, so let\u2019s go,\u201d I said hurriedly, because I wanted the same thing.</p><p>With a laugh, Eli gave me a quick kiss, grabbed my hand, and led me back down the steps of Tybee\u2019s lighthouse.</p> <p>I\u2019d never look at it the same again.</p><p>The drive back to my apartment was excruciatingly long and sensually painful at the same time. We didn\u2019t speak\u2014not with words, anyway. Eli read every sexual thought I had, and I knew it, so I let my mind wander freely. It was so easy, and almost amusing. I\u2019d think about how I wanted to run my hand along his thigh, to his crotch, and before the thought actually was completed, Eli had my hand in his and had moved it to his leg. I edged as close to him as my seat belt would allow, and nuzzled his neck, drew his earlobe into my mouth and sucked while my hand roamed over his thigh, cupped his crotch. Slowly, I unfastened the buttons of his jeans and eased my hand inside, and the sound of his pained groan and my name on his lips made a flash of heat spread between my thighs. I was so turned on that I didn\u2019t think either of us would make it back to Inksomnia. We did\u2014barely.</p><p>We parked, and Eli reached over, clicked my seat belt, and dragged me onto his lap, our mouths melding together as we tasted, kissed, panted. Stumbling out of the Jeep, we somehow made it to the door; somebody\u2014I can\u2019t remember whether it was Eli or me\u2014opened the door, and once inside we fell against the wall. His kiss was fierce, desperate, and we didn\u2019t linger there. He carried me up the stairs and straight into my bedroom. With a loud slam he kicked the door shut. He crossed the room, and we fell onto the bed together, writhing and pawing at each other until every stitch of clothing lay on the floor. Our kisses were no longer gentle; they were frantic, and we each struggled for control. Eli touched me everywhere, dug his fingers into the flesh of my hips as he pulled me on top of him, and I straddled him and took his hard length deep inside of me. My head dropped backward, and I gasped with pleasure as the sensation of Eli filling me rushed through me. His hands left my hips and covered my breasts, trailed the dragons on my arms, and grazed my thighs.</p><p>In the next second, he flipped me, and Eli was on top of me, his weight resting on his forearms, and as he began to move inside of me, he lowered his head and pressed his mouth to mine. I wrapped my legs around him and moved with him; his mouth left mine as he buried his face in my neck. I shoved my hands through his hair, and as the orgasm gained strength I cried out Eli\u2019s name, then went breathless as shots of light fired behind my eyes. Eli found his release at the same time, intensifying mine, and it went on and on as our bodies writhed in pleasure. The residue of orgasm began to retract, slowly, and as it did, Eli\u2019s mouth moved to my lips. He kissed me, his hands buried in my hair and cradling my head gently; then he pulled back just enough that our gazes locked.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he whispered against my mouth. He kissed me again. \u201cYou are mine.\u201d</p> <p>In the shadows I stared into the eyes of a vampire, grazed his mouth with my finger. \u201cNo, you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>Over the next few days I felt rejuvenated. Where I\u2019d felt catatonic before, now I felt ready to kick some ass. It wasn\u2019t so much because of what I\u2019d seen at the warehouse. It\u2019d been gruesome, absolutely. Horrific. And, strangely enough, it wasn\u2019t my amazing relationship with Eli, although I have to admit, it was seriously empowering. But even that wasn\u2019t it. It was the deep responsibility I felt for that man\u2019s life, for all the kids\u2019 lives in that freaking warehouse, Zac the almost marine, the woman in the park\u2014everyone who had been slaughtered just so a couple of satanic undead creatures could revitalize their powers. It pissed me off. Even deeper was a responsibility to end it. To destroy the monsters. I wanted to do something, not sit around on my ass and wait.</p><p>Every day that passed, I missed my brother even more. We were so close; it was like a part of me was missing, like I\u2019d lost a body part. It hurt. My chest actually, physically hurt\u2014especially knowing where he was, what he was doing, and what he was fast becoming. Every time I\u2019d look in his room, my body went numb. Seth was the only blood family I had left. I wanted my baby brother back, dammit.</p><p>Despite Eli\u2019s run to Da Island to get protection against killing me, and the threat that was always present, I wanted him. Desperately. I mean, I hated sounding like some weakling who can\u2019t make it in life without a man, but damn. We\u2019d clicked. I\u2019d felt it. And I wanted it. I wanted him. And he wanted me\u2014he made no effort to hide it. I didn\u2019t care that he was undead, and I didn\u2019t care that he\u2019d outlive me. Yet Gilles\u2019 words rang in my head continuously\u2014almost as though he kept doing it on purpose to keep me from caving in to my desires. Actually, he did put a thought into my head. He literally told me that Eli would have his head better in the game if he wasn\u2019t preoccupied by me. Say what? It was hard\u2014don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019ve never experienced so much difficulty keeping my hands off a man in the whole of my life. Worse than that, I had to pretend that it didn\u2019t bother me so much, that I didn\u2019t care. Goddamn, I did care. Too much for my own good. And he affected me. Whoa. Did he ever. And who am I kidding? He knew it. The guy freely dug into my thoughts.</p><p>I did pretty well, keeping my distance those few days, and Eli actually allowed it. I\u2019d made it perfectly clear that we needed to focus on this mission and not get caught up in a lust affair. Eli had made quite an effort, too, at the urging of his papa; he\u2019d stayed away, and Phin continued to be my babysitter.</p><p>The dreams continued.</p> <p>I had two more nights at the apartment. I\u2019d agreed to spend the rest of Seth\u2019s quickening at the House of Dupr\u00e9, mainly to train. If anything, I was a workaholic, and hell yeah, I\u2019d train my ass off if it helped take down the Arcoses. I\u2019d dreamed the two nights before; I\u2019d kept them to myself because of the nature of the dreams. They were highly intense, erotic, at times freakishly kinky, and part of me thought they came over me because of what I went to bed each night thinking of: Eli. The first night, after the warehouse, I found myself back at the Panic Room, in one of the back rooms, completely naked, my limbs spread and roped to the bed\u2014something I\u2019d never been into. I liked control too much, I guess. He was there\u2014always the same beautiful, flawless, freaky guy\u2014and he did nothing more than stare at me. He whispered nasty-bad things in my head, things he wanted to do to me with his tongue, how many different positions he wanted to take me in, and it was like a drug. I wanted to break free and escape the panic rooms, and put as much distance between us as possible; I wanted him inside me first. It was insane. Not once had this dream guy ever physically touched me. Afterward, I felt wicked guilty.</p><p>The following night I found myself alone at an amusement park on the waterfront\u2014sort of like Coney Island, I guess. He pursued me through the park, slowly, never relenting. I ducked into the house of mirrors, only to find him there, watching me. When I looked in all the mirrors, I saw us, naked and entwined. I ran to escape, and ran so hard I woke up with chest pain. Weird. Both very weird. I\u2019d never seen this guy in my life, and all I knew of him was that he was one horny little toad who had some major control over my brain.</p><p>I climbed out of bed and got ready as usual. I had only one client, and then I\u2019d be heading over to the Dupr\u00e9s\u2019\u2014along with my entourage of Gullah bodyguards. I don\u2019t know why, but I felt safe with them. I know it sounds crazy, but I firmly believed the Dupr\u00e9s were a much different breed of undead than . . . any other undead out there. Besides, Estelle had given me a canister filled with my special brew.</p><p>No sooner did I pull on my jeans, black fishnet long sleeve, and white ripped Inksomnia tank than a harsh banging at the back entrance made me jump. When I stepped into the living room, Phin watched me; I shrugged, and jogged downstairs to see who it was. When I opened the door I was surprised\u2014and repulsed\u2014to see someone I\u2019d hoped never to lay eyes on again.</p><p>\u201cWell, Ms. Poe,\u201d Detective Claude Murray said. His eyes regarded me a little too closely for comfort. As they always had. \u201cAll grown-up, I see.\u201d</p><p>I inspected him. \u201cAnd I see you\u2019re still packed into that suit like a sardine.\u201d</p><p>He grinned\u2014looked like he still chewed tobacco\u2014and shook his head. \u201cGrown-up but still a smart-ass, eh? Figures.\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cYou need to take a little trip down to the station for some questions, little miss tight pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Phin said from over my shoulder. I could feel his tension rolling off him in waves. Phin might look innocent, but he was anything but. I knew he could rip Claude\u2019s arms off in less than five seconds.</p> <p>Claude ignored Phin and stared hard at me. \u201cYou\u2019ll find out. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I gave a short laugh. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m riding anywhere with you, you\u2019ve grown senile in your old age, Murray.\u201d I grabbed my keys off the hook. \u201cWhy am I needed for questioning?\u201d I asked, hooking my pack onto my back.</p><p>Claude Murray, a graying man in his midfifties and getting more portly by the second, gave me a hard stare. \u201cLooks like your past is coming back to bite you in that little ass of yours, Poe,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYour old boyfriend Kelter Phillips just turned up at the city morgue.\u201d His gaze raked over my body, and I literally felt like I needed a bath. \u201cAnd according to his girlfriend, you were the last to see him alive.\u201d</p><p>Part 9</p><p>QUICKENING</p><p>I was pretty sure that perv Murray noticed the shock on my face about Kelter, and was even surer he took pleasure in delivering the information. Not that there was any love lost\u2014not by any means. It\u2019s always a shock when someone dies unexpectedly\u2014even a scumbag like Kelter. I was actually surprised he\u2019d lived as long as he had.</p><p>On the way to the police station I gave Phin the skinny on my background with Detective Claude Murray. I stared at a traffic light through my shades and began. \u201cOl\u2019 Claude had a thing for me back then\u2014yeah, gross, I know. Even though I was just a kid, I could tell he was a freak. I\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t the only juvy he had a thing for.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Phin asked, his voice growing dark, like Eli\u2019s did.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cYou know\u2014his touch lingered way too long when cuffing or uncuffing me, and whenever we were alone he\u2019d touch my hair, brush against me\u2014sick stuff like that.\u201d I laughed cynically. \u201cI guess because I was a little junkie at the time, he thought he could get away with it. And he had. I\u2019d been privately scared of him back then. Now? I\u2019ll kick his ass, even if it means a night or two in jail.\u201d</p><p>Phin sat quietly in the passenger seat and listened, his face growing angrier by the second, and I knew then that Detective Claude Murray was now on the Dupr\u00e9s\u2019 lifelong shit list.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, and punched him in the arm. \u201cI got it. No worries. I\u2019m a big girl now, not some crazy little druggie teenager. Okay?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me, and although I couldn\u2019t see his eyes through his shades, I knew he was scowling. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>I parked the Jeep and popped some quarters in the meter, and Phin walked into the station with me. He stood against the wall and waited, arms folded over his chest, and I was led into the back. When I glanced back, he had his cell phone out, and I knew he was calling Eli. Oh, boy. Phin shrugged, and I continued down the hall.</p><p>I knew the way, of course, and saw that things really hadn\u2019t changed in ten years. Claude was waiting farther up the hall\u2014the inside of the station reminded me a lot of junior high, with dingy white concrete walls and tile floors, wooden doors with little brown nameplates screwed onto them. And . . . it smelled funny. Weird-funny, and it brought back old, unwanted memories. Claude smiled at me as the police officer escorted me to the interrogation room, and I went quietly in and sat down.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re hanging out with old friends, Ms. Poe?\u201d Claude asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo. Just went by for a few drinks.\u201d</p><p>Claude leaned over my shoulder. \u201cI have a witness that says she watched you enter the back rooms with Kelter Phillips after making nicey with him at the bar. And you know we know what goes on back there.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a glare. \u201cGet to the point, Detective. Yes, I saw him that night, but so did hundreds of others. When I left, he was very much alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlibi?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. Why don\u2019t you ask the doorman, Zetty? He watched me leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you with anyone?\u201d He walked around to face me. \u201cOh\u2014let me clarify that. Were you with someone whose last name you knew?\u201d</p> <p>Prick. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Claude blinked and waited. \u201cWell, are you going to give me a name?\u201d</p><p>I looked him in the eye, although I hated bringing Eli into this. \u201cEligius Dupr\u00e9, and I was with him all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need to speak with him.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t even blink. \u201cNo problem. Can I go now? I have an appointment.\u201d</p><p>Claude\u2019s slow, thin-lipped grin stretched over tobacco-stained teeth. \u201cI bet you do.\u201d He inclined his head. \u201cYou\u2019re free to go. But we may need to drop by and have a look around.\u201d</p><p>I stood and shrugged. \u201cBe my guest. I have nothing to hide.\u201d I gave him a look that I hope mirrored my revulsion. \u201cLater, Claude. Much, much later.\u201d</p><p>I walked out and let the door slam behind me. When I reached the waiting area, Eli stood next to Phin and Luc, an infuriated look on his face. I walked up to him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014but he wanted to know if I\u2019d been with anyone at the time we left the Panic Room.\u201d I felt awful. \u201cHe wants to talk to you.\u201d I lowered my voice. \u201cDid you kill him? Kelter?\u201d</p> <p>Eli said nothing, and I guessed that meant no. He walked to the counter and spoke to the clerk, and within seconds another officer escorted him down to interrogation.</p><p>I glanced at Phin. \u201cDid you tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d he confirmed.</p><p>I let out a sigh. I\u2019d known he would, but no way would Eli be able to hide his anger at Murray. Surprisingly, within minutes, Eli strode from the back, his eyes glued to mine. Still furious. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d he said.</p><p>The afternoon went by relatively quickly, and I heard nothing else from Murray; Eli and the guys disappeared while Nyx and I wrapped up appointments. I always dressed the part on workdays\u2014clients had come to expect it of me. It was as much a part of my reputation as my artwork. So I wore a kick-ass outfit: a burgundy leather minidress, sleeveless and laced from the waist up, and a pair of over-the-knee black leather boots. A plain black velvet choker and matching velvet wrist cuffs completed my attire. The clients were more than satisfied. Nyx had decided to take the next day off and take care of some family business with her parents on Wilmington Island; she finished up just before I did; it was almost seven. As she grabbed her skull-and-crossbones shoulder bag, she came over and gave me a tight hug. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss you,\u201d she said, and looked at me with those big, round, always-wide-open blue eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about a thing. If the police come by to check the place out, I\u2019ll make sure I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, and rubbed her arms. \u201cI\u2019ll be around until late tomorrow afternoon anyway. And I really appreciate your help, Nyx. Call me on my cell if anything comes up.\u201d</p><p>We said good-bye, Gene cawing sharply as Nyx left out the front door. I locked up\u2014earlier than usual, but I\u2019d canceled all my appointments and still needed to handle a few loose ends for the business. I flipped the sign to CLOSED, pulled the blinds, and cranked up some Linkin Park. I was at the computer, printing out some of my latest designs on transfer paper for Nyx, when I felt Eli\u2019s presence and glanced up. He stood leaning against the doorjamb with his arms crossed over his chest, watching me.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, casual, as I\u2019d tried to keep it since his return. I continued my work. Eli pushed off the frame and walked up front, plopping down on the sofa. He picked up a design album and started thumbing through the pages.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to kill that detective today.\u201d</p><p>I glanced up. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve had that same thought myself before,\u201d I said, trying to lighten the mood. I gathered the transfers and hung them on the backlights\u2014similar to what doctors use when viewing X-rays. I stood there, inspecting for imperfections, and suddenly felt Eli directly behind me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I wanted to kill him.\u201d</p><p>I turned around and met his enraged gaze. \u201cWhy?\u201d And it was then I saw that anger had been brewing in Eli all day.</p><p>\u201cBecause of how he treated you as a kid,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for his thoughts today.\u201d His eyes bored into mine. \u201cIt would have been so easy.\u201d</p><p>I placed a hand on Eli\u2019s chest. \u201cI appreciate your chivalry. Really. But he\u2019s just a stupid mortal. I can handle him.\u201d I smiled. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>The air around us stilled; Eli\u2019s gaze grew dark. \u201cWhat do you feel when you touch me?\u201d he asked, and slid my hand over his heart. \u201cAnything?\u201d</p><p>It was something I\u2019d been avoiding; it hadn\u2019t been easy. The thing between us was palpable, dangerous, and I\u2019d known it went deeper than sex the moment we\u2019d met. He\u2019d told me quite seriously that I was his. I\u2019d told him the same, yet the subject hadn\u2019t been approached again. What did mine actually mean? I lowered my hand and moved away. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Eli.\u201d</p><p>Silence gripped the interior of Inksomnia for several moments before Eli surprised me with a request. \u201cI want you to ink me.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, gauged him. \u201cTats are for life\u2014and with yours that\u2019s a long damn time.\u201d I cocked my head. \u201cDo you know what you want?\u201d</p><p>Eli kept his gaze on mine. \u201cYes.\u201d He lifted the medallion from his neck. \u201cThis. It\u2019s our family crest.\u201d</p><p>Bending my head over the medallion, I inspected the design and detailing. I\u2019d not noticed it before, and I now found it fascinating. A griffin clutching a pair of daggers sat in the center of a fleur-de-lis, encased by a thorny vine. At the bottom, the name Dupr\u00e9. I looked at him. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty wicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you do it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I grinned, grasped him by the hand, and shoved him in the chair. \u201cSit.\u201d I grabbed a pencil and sketch pad and within minutes had the entire design on paper\u2014it was roughly the size of an orange. I showed it to Eli, and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he said.</p><p>I scanned the design, then printed out a transfer and walked back to Eli, whose gaze remained locked onto mine. \u201cWhere?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBetween my shoulder blades,\u201d he returned. \u201cBlack ink.\u201d</p><p>My heart beat faster, and I nodded. \u201cOff with the shirt, and let\u2019s get going.\u201d</p><p>Eli pulled his shirt over his head and turned onto his stomach on the inking table. I slowly wiped his skin with antiseptic and let it air dry, then laid the transfer print-side down, directly between his shoulder blades. I started the Widow, pulled on my gloves, loaded the ink, and bent over to Eli\u2019s ear. \u201cThis might sting a little.\u201d I settled into my chair.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo laughing,\u201d I warned. I peeled the transfer off and began. Eli didn\u2019t even flinch. \u201cNice,\u201d I said, and concentrated on my design. I admit, it was a pretty cool design and would make a sick tat. With a steady hand I inked the Dupr\u00e9 crest over the muscular back of the eldest son. Tattooing Eli under such intimate conditions was beyond erotic\u2014my breathing increased; my heart quickened. My breasts brushed his side as I bent over him, and even through gloves the contact of my skin against his aroused me. His scent radiated off of him in waves, and I drew it into my lungs, and that aroused me, too. It took about an hour and forty minutes to complete, and swear to God, I didn\u2019t want it to end. Finally, it was finished, and it looked badass.</p><p>I handed Eli the hand mirror, and he turned and checked out my work. \u201cNice,\u201d he said appreciatively, then turned to me. \u201cYou\u2019re a superb artist.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shrugged. \u201cThanks,\u201d I said, then took a deep breath and tried to push away the intense sexual feelings just being in the same room with Eli stirred within me. I busied myself cleaning up, then turned off the Widow. I crossed the room, and the whole time I felt Eli\u2019s eyes on me.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you blowing me off?\u201d he said, following me. Shirtless. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you.\u201d</p><p>I flipped the lights and walked to the stairs in the back. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Eli. It\u2019s not like me. But it\u2019s what I feel is best for both of us.\u201d</p> <p>He grabbed me just as I reached the staircase. \u201cYou feel it\u2019s best, or are you afraid of me? Disgusted by what I am?\u201d He pulled me against him, and his hot glare struck me. \u201cThe truth, Riley.\u201d</p><p>I glared back. \u201cLet. Me. Go. I\u2019m not arguing in the staircase.\u201d</p><p>His hand dropped my arm like it\u2019d been burned. \u201cLet\u2019s go, then.\u201d</p><p>I knew I ventured in very dangerous territory by walking those stairs and trapping myself between my apartment walls with Eli Dupr\u00e9 again\u2014especially since Gilles had warned me to keep away. But in the heat of the moment, and argument, it seemed the only thing to do. The tension between us over the past several days since Tybee had been nearly unbearable, and to settle things before I actually had to stay under the same roof with him and his entire family was my intention. I stomped ahead of him, knowing full well his eyes were on my ass; I didn\u2019t care. Inside the apartment, the long, hazy shadows crossed the room and rafters as the dog days of August waned through the picture window. It suddenly struck me that neither my brother nor my dog was present; everything I loved was gone, and nothing would ever be the same again. I rounded on Eli. \u201cWhat exactly do you expect from me? I can\u2019t lie\u2014you regularly read my mind, so I\u2019m sure you already know how badly I want you all of the time. It\u2019s like some freaking sickness, or a hex. You know I\u2019m not scared of you because of what you are. You know it.\u201d</p><p>His eyes and voice gentled. \u201cYou should be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShoulda, coulda, woulda,\u201d I said, sounding like a child. \u201cI guess rule following and good-choice making aren\u2019t in my nature, either.\u201d</p><p>Eli moved closer, his eyes locked onto mine. \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about you. I can\u2019t stop thinking about that night. Both nights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I get it,\u201d I said, and sank into the plush cushion of the seat in the picture window. Whether mortal or vampire, both male species are led around by their peckers, it seemed. \u201cSo it\u2019s the sex you\u2019re obsessed with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sex with you,\u201d Eli clarified, and stepped closer to me. \u201cWith just you.\u201d His body closed in on me as he leaned against the wall next to me. Still, he didn\u2019t touch me, but I felt my will busting up. \u201cIt\u2019s the way you move, the sound of your voice,\u201d he said, his voice dark, seductive. \u201cThe way you thought about me that night, about what you wanted me to do to you, and how you touched yourself. The way you smell\u2014not your perfume, or the shampoo you use,\u201d he said, lifting a long strand of my hair to his nose and inhaling. \u201cYou.\u201d He shoved his hands into his hair with frustration. \u201cI\u2019ve watched you, Riley\u2014even before we met. You . . . intrigued me, and I found myself at your window, inside your room.\u201d His eyes searched mine. \u201cIt\u2019s about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou watched me from inside my room?\u201d I asked, my voice shaky, quiet. The thought thrilled me. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou intrigued me,\u201d he said, his body brushing mine. \u201cBecause I had to.\u201d</p> <p>Already, my heart was beating faster, and I struggled to breathe normally. I couldn\u2019t stop staring at the muscles in his chest, the way his abs were cut, and his face; the shadows had grown long, and the room was nearly cast in darkness, yet there was just enough surreal light to make out his features. His pitch-black hair hung across his forehead and luminescent blue eyes, and when he spoke, his lips fascinated me; they were full, perfectly shaped, and the memory of them against my skin made me burn for him all over again. His jaw, dusted with just a shade of growth, made his pale skin flawless and sensual. My fingers itched to touch him. My heart yearned for him. My brain had turned to gravy.</p><p>Without taking his eyes off me, Eli drew closer, grasped my hand and placed it over his heart. \u201cAgain, I ask. What do you feel when you touch me?\u201d</p><p>My eyes closed as his hand covered mine and pressed it against his chest. \u201cI feel . . . a sensual energy that I can\u2019t get enough of, that lingers on my skin, inside of me, and drives me crazy,\u201d I said quietly, my chest rising and falling faster with my ragged breathing. I looked at him. \u201cAn obsession. I feel you.\u201d</p><p>Eli slid even closer and pressed his palm over mine. \u201cBut no heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>I rose, slipped my hands over Eli\u2019s hips, and guided him onto the cushion I\u2019d just vacated. Grasping his neck, I climbed onto his lap, my leather dress riding up as I slid my legs on either side of him and locked them behind his back. He sat silent, completely still, and I knew that if he did have a heart that beat, it\u2019d be pounding like crazy right now. His hands slid to my hips as his eyes searched mine.</p><p>I palmed his chest and brought my lips closer to his. \u201cMy heart beats enough for the both of us,\u201d I whispered against his mouth. \u201cJust don\u2019t . . . kill me, okay?\u201d I shoved my hands into his silky hair and kissed him softly, and he sat still while I explored his mouth. I sucked his bottom lip, slowly, then traced his teeth with my tongue, and the unshaven scruff on his jaw against my palm turned me on and made me slide closer. I slid my hand down his throat, and he ran his hands over my bared thighs, pulled me hard against him, and deepened the kiss. My mind went completely blank as his tongue grazed mine, and his mouth moved erotically over my lips, and everywhere his hands touched made me burn for him.</p><p>\u201cDid you mean it when you said I was yours?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>I looked into his eyes. \u201cYou know I did.\u201d</p> <p>Eli stood, and although he held on to me, I slid from his embrace and turned around, threaded my fingers through his, and tugged, urging him to my room. He wordlessly followed, but he pulled me close while we walked, my back to his front, and he dropped my hand and slid his fingers over my hips and held me tightly against him; the feel of his hardness pressed into the small of my back made me hot and wet, and I wiggled against him, stretched my arms up, and clasped them around his neck. His hands slipped upward, skimmed slowly over the buttery smooth softness of my dress, and cupped my breasts, and even through the thin leather it caused sensations to ripple through me, turned me on even more. His mouth teased the skin at my throat, and my heart pounded with anticipation. I completely trusted him. I wholly wanted him.</p><p>In my bedroom, Eli stopped and kept me tight against him; we simply melded together. I\u2019d forgotten to power down the iPod station in the shop, and music from below rose up and drifted through the ventilation, and darkness had now claimed the shadows. Only shades and planes of half-light played against our features, obscuring full detail, leaving everything else up to other senses: touch, taste, scent. I lost myself in Eli; to me, he wasn\u2019t an immortal; he wasn\u2019t a vampire. He was . . . necessary.</p><p>\u201cEli,\u201d I said, unaware I\u2019d even spoken his name out loud. I relaxed against him while his hands explored me; with tortured slowness he pulled the laces loose at the bust of my dress, my breasts spilling out and Eli\u2019s palms covering them. My flesh turned warm, then hot, and his hands trailed down my sides to my hips, where he tugged my dress up higher, caressing my thighs and pulling my ass against his swollen crotch. He groaned in my ear; I nearly came at the sound of it. When his hand moved to my inner thigh, and over a little more, I shifted my hips; his fingers slipped first into the small triangle of silk, then eased slowly into my wetness. My head fell back against his chest and my body began to seize, but he moved his hand and stopped the orgasm. I almost touched myself, I was so frantic with desire and need. He stilled my hands, held them tightly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said against my ear. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>I willed myself to stop throbbing, and it almost didn\u2019t work. But Eli lifted me up in one swift move and laid me across the bed. He grabbed three pillows and stacked them behind me, pushed my dress up over my hips, and pulled my panties off slowly. Every nerve ending in my body hummed with pleasure; his strong hands slid up my thighs and pushed them apart, and as his head lowered and he tasted me with his tongue, I exploded, sparks went off behind my eyes, and I pushed my hands through his hair and held on. His fingers gripped my hips and tasted deeper, and my body seized with ecstasy. Before my orgasm was completed, he moved away, and I needed no cue. I was dying to have him inside me, and I followed him off the bed.</p><p>This time, my need was too powerful to rein in\u2014he\u2019d done it; he\u2019d caused it. I couldn\u2019t help it. We traded places. I pushed him backward onto the bed; I peeled out of my dress and boots and knelt between his legs as I deftly unfastened each button on his fly. I felt savage, feral, and nothing and no one could satisfy me except Eli. With a fierceness that surprised even him, I pulled off his jeans, only to find him bare beneath. I looked at him then, and his eyes were nothing but glassy black orbs in the darkness. I kept my gaze on his as I slid my hand over his hardness, rock hard and smooth at once; I drew him into my mouth; he jerked, groaned, and it made me wet all over again. I couldn\u2019t take much more. I moved back, eased first one thigh over his, then the other; I straddled him and took him in completely. The sensation of Eli filling me took my breath, and I gasped first, and then he grasped me and turned me onto my back, and followed me down. He stared at me, threaded his fingers through mine, and lifted my arms over my head.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d he asked, his voice thick, raspy.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answered in a hoarse whisper. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>In the most sensual move I\u2019d ever experienced in my life, Eli wrapped his arms completely around my back and held me as he began to move. Every inch of our bodies melded together, and he moved faster, we moved together, and the orgasm I\u2019d been denied twice exploded fully and my body jerked with uncontrolled spasms as I clutched desperately to Eli. His body moved with mine, and I felt his shudders as if they were my own. He slowed; he stopped; he didn\u2019t move off of me, his arms wound tightly around my body. He lay very, very still. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Too still.</p><p>Oh, hell.</p><p>I grew as still as Eli; I barely breathed. After nearly two minutes\u2014that\u2019s a long, long time\u2014I drew a slight breath. \u201cEli?\u201d I asked, barely a whisper.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Oh, shit.</p><p>Then, slowly, he lifted his head. I breathed a sigh of relief as a pair of nonopaque eyes stared down at me. A slight grin tilted the corner of his very sexy mouth. \u201cYou are amazing.\u201d He kissed me. \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>I punched him, and he laughed and buried his head in my shoulder. Then, while we were still completely wrapped around each other, Eli Dupr\u00e9 lowered his head and kissed me, gently, softly, taking a very long time to explore every inch of my mouth that may have been overlooked during our passion. Then he lifted a finger to my angel wing and touched it softly, following the etching as it fanned out to my temple. \u201cYou\u2019re such a variance, Riley Poe,\u201d he said. \u201cA sign of dark purity inked onto your face\u201d\u2014he stroked it again\u2014\u201cand disturbingly caring inside.\u201d He placed his hand over my heart. Incredible vaguely described lovemaking with Eli Dupr\u00e9. I knew then I was spoiled for eternity.</p><p>\u201cFor the record,\u201d he said, catching my bottom lip between his teeth. \u201cMy pecker doesn\u2019t lead me around.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed, and he quickly hushed me with his lips, his tongue, and then he eased to the side of me, pulled me close, and wrapped an arm over my stomach. He rested his chin on top of my head. \u201cGo to sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be here when you wake up.\u201d</p><p>Content, for a while, anyway, I closed my eyes and drifted off.</p><p>For the first time I felt cherished, and worthy of a morning after.</p><p>How a dream could plague me after sex with Eli, I have no idea, but I found myself in a horse-drawn carriage, my eyes turned to the window, where I peered outside into a dense forest of massive trees, gray foliage, and rock. Everything looked gray, bleak. The horses\u2019 hooves pounded the terrain at a gallop, and the carriage veered precariously close to the edge of a cliff before changing direction and plunging into the shadows, deeper into the wood. The horses slowed to a trot, and I eased back against the cushions and closed my eyes. I don\u2019t know how long I kept them shut, but when I opened them again, he sat across from me. Dressed in black breeches, tall black boots, and a blood burgundy velvet coat, with white ruffles at the neck and cuffs, he watched me, studied me with intensity as though trying to figure me out. The auburn-haired woman sat beside him, her face hidden, pressed against his chest, her hand possessively resting on his thigh; sleeping, I supposed. It was difficult to determine, as she was very, very still. His gaze wandered seductively over me, shameless and bold, and then with his eyes still fastened to mine\u2014as I was powerless to look away\u2014he leaned his head down and whispered to the woman, yet I heard it clearly in my own head. \u201cUnlace my breeches.\u201d Only her hand moved, and she skillfully loosened the laces as though she\u2019d done it many times before. I didn\u2019t want to watch; I couldn\u2019t pull my gaze away. \u201cTouch me,\u201d he whispered again, and once more I heard the words in my head as though he\u2019d spoken them to me. The woman slid her hand slowly into his breeches and stroked him; I could feel his hardness in my own palm, and I sat, entranced. He was enjoying me watching, and I wanted to look away so badly, but I hadn\u2019t the will. \u201cRide me.\u201d The woman kept her back turned as she lifted her skirts and straddled him. He watched me over her shoulder as she rode him, and I jerked at the heavy sensation of him between my legs. I didn\u2019t want to come; I couldn\u2019t help but seize with orgasm. His beautiful face tensed with pleasure at my weakness, and then he pulled the woman\u2019s blouse down, baring her back. As I stared in horror once again at the familiar tattoo winding up her spine and over her arm, she glanced over her shoulder and stared. Her face was pale\u2014too pale\u2014and her lips were bloodred, her eyes opaque. She was me. It was then that I noticed the movement outside of the carriage; winged creatures with unhinged jaws and jagged teeth flew by, their faces distorted into those of horrific creatures. They looked in at me. They were hungry, and they wanted my special blood\u2014I knew it. Yet when I turned back to him, he smiled, two long fangs dropped from his top jaw, and with a gentle touch he pushed the woman\u2019s head to the side, sank his teeth into her, and drank. I felt the pain in my own neck, felt the life draining fast out of me. The winged creatures began beating on the side of the carriage, screeching, clawing to get at me. I screamed. . . .</p><p>\u201cRiley!\u201d</p><p>I bolted up, my heart out of control, gasping for air. My body ached, as though I\u2019d run a triathlon, and I fell back to the pillows just as quickly. I tried to catch my breath, but I was hyperventilating. Then I saw Eli, bent over me, concern etched into his perfect features.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, and placed a hand over my heart. \u201cTake it easy, Riley. Breathe.\u201d He kept his hand on me, and for some reason, it helped.</p><p>\u201cThe dreams,\u201d I said, my breathing slowing. \u201cThey\u2019re so freaky. I don\u2019t like them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat dreams?\u201d he asked, and part of his face was illuminated by the light coming through the French doors. I glanced at them\u2014they were closed.</p><p>I shook my head and put a palm over my eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve had, like, four of them,\u201d I said, thinking I\u2019d lost count. \u201cThey\u2019re hideous, and nasty erotic.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s voice grew steely. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re humiliating,\u201d I said, and was surprised by my own reaction. \u201cDon\u2019t take offense\u2014I don\u2019t have any control over dreams, and in the dream I am not a willing participant,\u201d I started. \u201cI try my best to escape. But they\u2019re weird\u2014always the same guy, very hot, and he . . . talks dirty to other women, gets them to touch him.\u201d I glanced at him. \u201cYou know? And . . . he watches me get turned on by it.\u201d</p><p>Eli stared incredulously at me. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cSomething horrific always happens at the end. Death. Vampiric death. And the woman he talks dirty to? When she turns around and looks at me, it\u2019s me. She has my tattoos and everything.\u201d</p> <p>Shoving his hands through his hair, Eli sat up and propped his elbows against his knees. \u201cDescribe him.\u201d His voice was edgy.</p><p>\u201cI . . . don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, and realized suddenly I didn\u2019t know much about him at all. \u201cHe\u2019s just . . . gorgeous. Beautiful, actually. Long dark hair. Dark eyes.\u201d I looked at Eli. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can remember.\u201d</p><p>Eli slowly rose from the bed and walked; the light from outside cast sharp shadows across his naked, perfect body, throwing dark planes against the ridged muscles of his abdomen, and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever seen a more beautiful man in my life. Way more beautiful than the guy in my funky porn dreams.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Eli said, casting me a slight grin. He continued to pace. \u201cThis is not good, Riley.\u201d He sat on the side of the bed and tucked my hair behind my ear. \u201cWe need to tell my father.\u201d</p><p>I slapped my own forehead. \u201cOh my God, Eli. Are you kidding me? First Gilles learns we have nasty sex\u2014did you know he dug in your brain to find that juicy morsel? And now you\u2019re going to tell him I have porn dreams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I sat up and stared at him. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s gaze darkened with concern. \u201cBecause. It sounds like one of the Arcoses.\u201d</p><p>My stomach twisted at the thought. \u201cHow is he invading my dreams?\u201d I rubbed my eyes. \u201cThey\u2019re so . . . realistic.\u201d</p><p>Eli turned his head and looked at me for a long time. \u201cHe\u2019s been here. Because he\u2019s a direct bloodline of the strigoi. They have the power to invade the dreams of mortals.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cHe must be very taken with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked, and already my insides ran cold.</p><p>Eli dragged a knuckle over a loose strand of hair and brushed it out of my face. \u201cHe could have just as easily killed you, or taken you. Although in his weakened state he more than likely can do nothing more than cast dreams.\u201d He closed his eyes and sighed. \u201cIt must be Victorian. His brother is much too vicious to waste time with dreams. He would have taken pleasure with you, or not; then he would have killed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut his strength has grown, right?\u201d I asked, and Eli laced his fingers through mine. \u201cWhy is he still making me dream? And how can he do it with you sitting right beside me? How does he even know who I am?\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s gaze searched my face. \u201cI don\u2019t know. But he\u2019s taken with you. And the strigoi are powerful beings, Riley.\u201d He pulled me to his chest and settled against the pillows. \u201cDo you dream more than once at night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so far,\u201d I replied, draping my arm over his stomach. \u201cAnd taken isn\u2019t quite the term. More like obsessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Now, go back to sleep. I\u2019ll be right here.\u201d</p><p>I was quiet for a while, my thoughts rambling, and finally, slumber took me again, and Victorian blessedly left me alone.</p><p>When next I woke, bright morning sunlight streamed through the French doors. I was on my stomach, and the gentle, erotic touch of Eli\u2019s fingers dragging across my spine, tracing every intricate detail of the inked dragon, aroused me. We explored each other, touching, kissing; while we began against the softness of the down topper on my bed, we ended up on the hardwood floor, and we finished in the shower. Eli washed my long hair, and I washed his crazy-sexy black hair. I gave him a soapy Mohawk, and we laughed. I can\u2019t remember ever having a man wash me with such . . . enthusiasm before. And I\u2019m pretty positive I haven\u2019t had a man stick around long enough to have a laugh with me the next morning. Eli was an anomaly, one I feared my heart was laid wide-open for.</p><p>I finished first, and Eli wanted to enjoy the hot water a little longer. So I pulled on a pair of hipster shorts, a cami, and flip-flops, and ran down to the shop to turn off the iPod home system and gather a few things I\u2019d be taking to the Dupr\u00e9 House. I was flipping through the supply books when a knock at the back door made me jump. Not so much to my surprise, Detective Claude Murray in all his too-tight-suit glory stood there, a smirk on his face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMind if I take a look around?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve nothing to hide, right?\u201d</p><p>I threw the door open and cast a hand out. \u201cBe my guest. Shop\u2019s this way.\u201d I started for the front, and I felt Claude\u2019s eyes on my ass the whole time. I heard the door shut with a click, and Claude\u2019s stressed-out loafers crossed the floor behind me. I continued with what I\u2019d been doing, and the detective slowly perused Inksomnia.</p><p>\u201cI always knew you were a little freak, Ms. Poe,\u201d he said, glancing through the art books. He looked up and smiled. \u201cNow that you\u2019re all grown-up, I bet you\u2019re even freakier, huh?\u201d He moved to the desk and computer. \u201cNo appointment book?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWelcome to the twenty-first century, gramps,\u201d I said. \u201cEverything\u2019s on the computer.\u201d I didn\u2019t like him in my shop, and I didn\u2019t like him touching my belongings. I wanted him gone.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d he said, inclining his balding head toward the screen. \u201cJust pull up the files for last Friday.\u201d</p><p>This forced me to move closer to him, and I swallowed my rage and did so. I logged on, pulled up the client appointment file\u2014although I had no idea what he thought he could find there\u2014and turned the screen toward him. \u201cEnjoy.\u201d</p><p>In the next second, Claude moved behind me and brushed against my ass. I jumped, and he laughed. \u201cYou remember back when your punk ass was in my jail on a weekly basis? All strung out and high as a kite?\u201d I froze, and he leaned closer. \u201cYou\u2019d fuck anything for a fix back then.\u201d He dropped a small, cellophane-wrapped object the size of a roll of dimes on my desk, and his hand moved to my ass. \u201cHow \u2019bout now?\u201d he said, his voice thick, his breath thicker. \u201cFor old times\u2019 sake?\u201d</p><p>I reacted; I knew it\u2019d get my ass landed in jail, but I didn\u2019t care. Elbowed him in the gut; when he fell back, I laced my fingers together into a tight fist and swung up, catching Claude right smack in the nose. He stumbled back, wiped the blood trickling down his face. He wasn\u2019t shocked or surprised; it seemed to have turned him on even more. \u201cRough little bitch, aren\u2019t ya?\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cThat\u2019ll cost ya.\u201d</p> <p>But he surprised me; in a move I didn\u2019t expect, he popped me right in the mouth. I felt my lip split again, and in the next breath I kneed him in the balls. Claude didn\u2019t have time to react after that; he didn\u2019t even have time to fall to his knees.</p><p>Eli emerged\u2014was suddenly there, enraged, and I watched in horror as he grabbed the detective by the throat and lifted him off the ground.Eli\u2019s face contorted\u2014his jaw unhinged and jagged fangs dropped long; his eyes grew opaque\u2014and urine ran down Claude Murray\u2019s leg and onto the floor. Eli pulled his face close to the detective\u2019s. \u201cLeave. Her. Alone,\u201d Eli growled, his voice not his own, dark, menacing. Claude gasped, choked, and right before my eyes I watched the color drain completely from his face. His body jerked, twitched, and then grew still. Very, very still. Lifeless eyes stared at me, and my insides froze. Eli dropped him onto the floor. The detective had just died of fright.</p><p>I stood there, shaking, as did Eli. His face returned to normal; his fangs slipped back inside. His eyes remained opaque as his fury slowly subsided. I said nothing, simply stared at the body of an SPD detective lying dead on my floor.</p><p>\u201cCall my brothers,\u201d he said, his voice edgy, and turned his back to me. \u201cCall Preacher.\u201d He grabbed the dope and shoved it into his pocket.</p><p>I did as he asked, although my mind was buzzing. I called Preacher first, then Phin. Preacher showed up first.</p><p>My surrogate grandfather walked in through the back and came straight to me. \u201cYou tell me what happened, girl,\u201d he said, and reached out with a thumb and wiped the blood off my lip. I told him about the Panic Room, about Kelter, and about me being questioned yesterday.</p> <p>\u201cThe detective showed up while Eli was showering. He . . . wanted to check the place out.\u201d I rubbed the back of my neck. \u201cThen, I don\u2019t know\u2014he started talking dirty to me, then put his hands on me.\u201d I looked at Preacher, and it was only then that I noticed that the other three Dupr\u00e9 men, Gilles included, had walked in. I glanced at them and continued. \u201cI reacted\u2014I elbowed him, and then I punched him.\u201d I looked at Eli, whose eyes were almost back to normal, but he was still silent, furious. \u201cEli didn\u2019t kill him,\u201d I said fervently. \u201cHe didn\u2019t. I think . . . he had a heart attack after seeing Eli change.\u201d</p><p>Preacher began speaking in French to Gilles; I of course didn\u2019t know what they spoke of.</p><p>\u201cPreacher\u2019s telling my father what Murray did to you as a child,\u201d Phin offered, and I gave him a nod of thanks.</p><p>I glanced at Gilles, and he looked at me. \u201cWorry not, ch\u00e8re; all will be well. You will soon learn that a creature of the afterlight cherishes beyond mortal imagination what is his, and will protect fiercely if challenged.\u201d He glanced at Eli, down at the detective, and back to me. \u201cWe no longer routinely kill; in this case, it could not be helped.\u201d Gilles and Preacher stepped off together and continued to speak in French. Eli grasped me by the elbow.</p><p>\u201cGo upstairs, Riley,\u201d he said. \u201cJosie and my mother are on their way.\u201d He glanced behind him, at the detective. \u201cWe have to take care of things now.\u201d He brushed a knuckle against my cheek. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>I covered his hand with mine. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d Our gazes lingered for a moment, and I\u2019d never felt the full weight of a man\u2019s stare before like I did with Eli. \u201cTell me this is going to be okay,\u201d I asked. I wanted him to say it badly.</p><p>\u201cIt will,\u201d he said. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>I left then, without a backward glance. I didn\u2019t want to see any more than I already had. I didn\u2019t want to think of how they\u2019d get rid of the detective\u2019s body, his car, or any trace of him being and dying in Inksomnia. I had to trust Eli, and I found myself surprised once again\u2014I truly did trust him. It wasn\u2019t until I was upstairs, and Josie, Elise, and Estelle were sitting in my kitchen, that I felt how my energy had drained. I sat at the table, Estelle made me a pot of tea, and two vampires, a Gullah root doctor\u2019s wife, and I kept one another company. It was so weird I almost laughed out loud. And if I thought that was weird, later on, when we all drove to Wal-Mart to pick up a few necessities for my stay at the Dupr\u00e9s\u2019? Now, that was funky. As we stepped inside the double automatic doors, a woman in her midthirties or early forties standing at the bulletin boards caught my eye. Her despondent expression as she thumbtacked a picture to the corkboard made me ache inside. I watched her for several moments as she stared at the photo, and my eyes followed hers to the picture\u2014a young guy Seth\u2019s age, wearing an Atlanta Braves baseball cap and smiling like there was nothing better in life. She stroked his face and walked away, and I continued to stare at that wall. In three of the pictures I recognized Seth\u2019s friends. There were many more hanging there.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be over soon, ch\u00e8re,\u201d Elise said, placing a hand on my shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll get the boys to safety and fix this. My husband, Eli and his brothers, your dark fellows, they never fail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDat\u2019s right, baby,\u201d Estelle said, and she linked her dark arm through my snowy white one. \u201cDem boys are tough as nails. Dey won\u2019t give up. Neither will your Preacher man, dat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Josie watched me curiously; she amazed me by how much of her environment she soaked in by merely listening to others. Even she gave me a smile. \u201cNo worries.\u201d</p><p>Later that day, as I was packing up in the apartment, the news came on announcing the death of one of Savannah\u2019s finest, Detective Claude Murray; he\u2019d succumbed to a long-standing cardiac problem. His funeral would be in two days. I didn\u2019t ask how, or why. I simply felt relief\u2014and a little guilt. I\u2019d hated that freaky guy, and inside, I wasn\u2019t sad he\u2019d croaked pissing his pants over the sight of Eli\u2019s transformation. Not one bit sad.</p><p>Over the next several days, the Dupr\u00e9s put me under the most strenuous workouts I\u2019ve ever experienced. During the day, I remained in the donjon on the top floor, and everyone got a poke at me; every family member had something unique to offer. Josie taught me the latest in acrobatics; I could now run toward a wall, run up it a ways, and flip completely over. My body felt strong, vibrant, alive. I felt like those guys in The Matrix Reloaded . Call me Neo. I am the One. Rather, I was, until Luc laid me flat on my ass. You know, there are those fight-club guys who kick and punch and just go nuts when they fight; then there are those like Luc who can almost remain perfectly still and catch you completely off guard while knocking you senseless. He showed me a few moves, and I began practicing. He let me win a couple of times.</p><p>Phin was a fantastic dodger and roller. Of course, moving like lightning helped, but seriously\u2014he was a fine, fine free runner in his own right. When we weren\u2019t in the donjon, we were outside, working every plane and flat surface of the Dupr\u00e9 House, its outbuildings, its wall. I already had natural abilities and athleticism, but perfecting the moves of a free runner was going to take a little time. Still\u2014when I made it to the roof for the first time, I squealed like a cheerleader.</p><p>Elise was an expert markswoman when it came to throwing a blade; she\u2019d been taught by the best: her husband. Thank God they didn\u2019t participate in the practices where I used a moving target. No way could I have thrown a blade at that sweet little woman\u2014no matter that she could rip a throat out in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Of course, in my opinion, Eli was the master of all. Yes, all. On and off the donjon mat, I might add. He was wicked fast, could free run like a mofo, and rivaled his mother with blade accuracy. I supposed when you live for as long as they have, you tend to just get good at stuff. I didn\u2019t have a century\u2019s worth of training, but I had a heart full of determination. I knew this was the only way for me to be able to help my brother. No way would Eli let me get near the boys, so close to the completion of their quickening, without a little more training. I worked hard, all day, every day. It wasn\u2019t until the fourth day of training that I began to feel weary. Extraordinarily weary, like I was coming down with the flu or something. My body ached\u2014and it was more than just soreness from the workouts, or the sex marathons with Eli. I didn\u2019t want to seem like a wiener, so I kept it to myself. I hated a complainer anyway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The interior of the Dupr\u00e9 House was enormous; you could literally go days inside without running into anyone, if that was what you wanted. As vampires, they pinched about two hours of sleep during the middle of the day; the rest of the time they were awake, out and about, mingling with Savannah\u2019s society. Elise loved antique shops. Gilles loved to go to the shooting range and had a massive gun collection. It was all very eye-opening.</p><p>I stayed with Eli; there was no question about that from the get-go. The moment I\u2019d arrived, he\u2019d carried my bags and led me straight to the west wing of the third floor, to a massive chamber. Inside were a large fireplace, a king-sized bed with intricately carved posts and headboards, and a gauzy white bed curtain. It was . . . perfect. Gilles and Elise were on the first floor; the others had rooms on the second floor. Philippe the butler had a room in the back of the first floor, and stayed with the Dupr\u00e9s twenty-four seven. He was a cool enough guy, and I always caught him checking out my inks. Pretty damn funny if you asked me. I bet he wanted one himself.</p><p>So while my days were filled with boot-camp, Parris Island-type, bad-vampire-slaying training, my nights were filled with edging the darkest, seediest places in the historic district, and tracking the boys. The Arcoses moved to a different place each night, making it more difficult to keep an eye on them. They were chronic, though\u2014dark places where kids looking for trouble would certainly find some. They offered drugs, alcohol, even women. Horrified, I\u2019d witnessed two prostitutes being killed; we\u2019d prevented several others from becoming prey. I knew where the darkest of souls hung out after dark; I used to be one of them. After Kelter Phillips\u2019 death, the Panic Room had closed its doors. Now the Morgue and the Asylum both were filled to the gills. Rarely did Eli let me out of his reach when inside, either. He knew I could fight; he\u2019d watched me kick Luc\u2019s ass plenty of times, although Luc had toned his skills down to match my mortal ones. Still, Eli was severely protective over me and my body. One groping hand to the ass and he\u2019d scatter the crowd just to find out which one did it. Honestly. I\u2019d dealt with scumbags so often in my past that they didn\u2019t offend me. These guys were pathetic, and it didn\u2019t take much for me to jerk an arm behind some pig\u2019s back, or twist a set of nuts until the jerk squealed like a girl. Eli didn\u2019t like others touching me; he secretly loved how much of a badass I was. I knew it.</p> <p>It was my third night in the Dupr\u00e9 House, and Eli had left me soaking in a bath to go speak to his father. \u201cI won\u2019t be long,\u201d he said, his eyes caressing me, making me shudder. \u201cWait for me.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d I wasn\u2019t usually a bubble-bath type girl, but damn. This wasn\u2019t an ordinary tub. It was a copper tub, and it was freaking huge.</p><p>Who could pass that up? So I closed my eyes and rested my head against the air pillow, and honestly, I didn\u2019t mean to fall asleep, but I did.</p><p>I\u2019d hoped being in another vampire\u2019s lair would keep the dreams away; I was so totally wrong. What was worse was that, after the incident with the detective, we\u2019d sort of forgotten about telling Gilles. Rather, Eli forgot\u2014which surprised me. I didn\u2019t forget. I just wanted to be spared the humiliation. I supposed Eli let it go once we settled in together, and the dreams seemingly stopped. They were now back.</p><p>I was running through a dark, dense wood. Everything around me was gray, desolate, colorless, yet the forest was alive. I ran, frightened, barefoot, my long black hair hanging free down my back, and a thin, gauzy white slip with thin satin straps clung to my pale body. A light rain began to fall, and soon the slip was completely drenched and see-through, and still I ran, though I didn\u2019t know whether I was running to something or from something. I was afraid. As I passed trees, I noticed him. He wore black breeches tucked into tall black boots, and a white gauzy shirt with billowy sleeves and laces at the neck. His pale, flawless skin was in stark contrast to the darkness of his hair, and dark brown eyes followed me as I ran. When I thought I\u2019d left him behind, he emerged from another tree, then another, without seeming to move at all. This time, he was alone. No other woman. Just him, me, and the forest.</p> <p>No, I sensed another\u2014another man. I couldn\u2019t see him, but I knew he was there, lurking. I continued to run until I tripped over a root hidden by fallen dead leaves. He was suddenly there, pulling me up, and I gasped at his beauty. That was when I heard the shrieks overhead, above the canopy of the forest. I knew the winged, fanged creatures were back, and they wanted me. I also knew him now: Victorian. I didn\u2019t want him to know I knew. \u201cIf you want your brother freed, you must come to me,\u201d he said, and his eyes turned opaque. \u201cI want you for my own. All those things I\u2019ve showed you are my dreams. Come to me, Riley Poe, but don\u2019t tell the others. Come alone, and I will set your brother free of his curse. Your life for his.\u201d He stroked my breast through the sheer wet material, and I shivered. \u201cYou will not regret it.\u201d Upon my chest he laid the bud of an unopened, bloodred rose. . . .</p><p>My eyes fluttered open, and I found myself still alone in the massive bathroom. The water had turned tepid; the bubbles had dissipated. A breeze drifted in through the open floor-length window, and when I glanced at the water, my heart seized. Floating beside me was the unopened bud of a bloodred rose. Victorian\u2019s words rang in my ears. Your life for his. I shivered, grabbed the bud, and stepped out of the tub. How had he been here without the others detecting him? Creepy. Sincerely creepy. Why was he so obsessed with me?</p><p>It would be a last resort. I\u2019d try the Dupr\u00e9s\u2019 way first. I wanted to actually be around after my brother recovered. But in the end, if it came down to it? Yeah, hell yeah, I\u2019d trade my life for Seth\u2019s. I tried with all my might to envision the Arcoses from the warehouse. It\u2019d been far enough away for me not to have seen their faces in detail\u2014not until they\u2019d transformed, anyway. But I had a difficult time believing that the beautiful guy in my dream\u2014Victorian\u2014was one of the guys at the warehouse. They were\u2014what had Gilles said? Twenty-one and twenty-two? I was having porn dreams about a twenty-one-year-old? Oh, Father.</p><p>Like I was saying: Every day was spent training. Though I certainly wished that I\u2019d never have to actually use any of my new skills, I worked hard and hoped that if it came down to a fight, my training would pay off. At night we\u2019d run the streets, stalk the clubs and the alleys outside of clubs, and search abandoned buildings. We\u2019d not been able to find the Arcoses since that night at the warehouse, and time was running out. Soon they\u2019d be fully restored, and Seth\u2019s quickening would be over. He\u2019d kill. He\u2019d become a killer.</p><p>Once we\u2019d finished running the streets, we\u2019d go to the Dupr\u00e9s\u2019, and Eli and I would head to our little slice of heaven on earth. He was the only thing that could relieve my mind of the problems at hand, the only soul who could comfort me. There wasn\u2019t a word to describe sex with Eli; I\u2019d tried several out, and all fell short. The man literally made me lose my mind. His look alone turned me on. His hands and mouth made me beg for release. It wasn\u2019t merely sex. It was . . . something I couldn\u2019t define. Something I never wanted to see end. Something I sadly felt would.</p><p>When the dreams stopped being dreams and started happening while I was wide-awake\u2014that was when I knew the shit was about to hit the fan. I don\u2019t know how he did it, but somehow Victorian placed thoughts into my head\u2014images, visions, requests. At first, I\u2019d turn around to see who\u2019d spoken to me. I\u2019d find myself completely alone. The words were always seductive: Come with me. I want you. I need you. Let me touch you. Feel me inside of you. Kiss me. Take me. Love me forever.</p> <p>The words rattled me; I didn\u2019t know what to expect, or whether he could hear me if I responded. I never did; I just kept them to myself.</p><p>The day Preacher showed up at the House of Dupr\u00e9 with a dozen Gullah, I knew our time was running short. I made a solemn vow to learn French once this was over. Whenever Preacher and Gilles got together, it was all they spoke.</p><p>\u201cThe quickening is almost here,\u201d Josie said beside me, listening to them. We were just getting ready to head out for the night when they\u2019d shown up. \u201cPreacher says the Arcoses are nearly fully rejuvenated.\u201d She looked at me. \u201cHe\u2019s making sure we protect you.\u201d</p><p>I had on my leather pants and boots and a snug black Lycra tank, and beneath the black leather jacket I\u2019d stashed multiple silver blades in the various pockets and holsters. Yes, all that leather in the dead of August. I was as hot as hell, but it was good protection. Eli had loaded me up, and when the hole didn\u2019t quite fit the blade, he made it fit. I had two stuffed into each boot. I just prayed I didn\u2019t impale myself. It was just past sundown when we left.</p><p>We made our way on the bikes up Whitaker, stopping by several places with no luck. Not one sign of Riggs, Seth, or the Arcoses. We checked the docks; nothing. We even checked the warehouses at the west end of River Street. Nothing. We ran nearly all night\u2014even once Eli checked in with Ned Gillespie, who claimed zero vampiric activity from the Tybee area. It was almost dawn when we got back to the house, and not once had we spotted a single hoodie. My stomach burned at the thought of the quickening coming to fruition. I wasn\u2019t going to let it happen. And that was why I came up with a plan.</p><p>I\u2019d lost my mind. Again. But for my brother I\u2019d do anything.</p><p>We walked into the small kitchen area\u2014Gilles and Elise each had a large glass of \u201cV8,\u201d and I sat down and looked both of them in the eye. \u201cI want to stop using the herbs so that my blood will lure Victorian and Valerian out of hiding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Eli said immediately, and not to me. \u201cNo way, Papa.\u201d</p> <p>I ignored Eli\u2019s pleas and searched Gilles\u2019 light blue gaze. \u201cPlease. You know it would work. And we have no more time.\u201d I grasped his hands with mine and begged. \u201cI want my brother back. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forbid it,\u201d Eli said angrily. \u201cRiley, hell no.\u201d</p><p>Gilles\u2019 stare didn\u2019t waver; he looked nowhere else for approval. \u201cYou are a reckless warrior, ma ch\u00e8re,\u201d he said, and his gaze bored deeply into mine. \u201cDo you fully understand what it would mean for you to cease drinking your special herbs?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said.</p><p>Eli grabbed me and yanked me out of the chair. \u201cNo, Riley, you don\u2019t understand!\u201d he said, infuriated. \u201cHave you ever witnessed a pack of dogs penned up without food or water for two weeks? Do you know what they do to anything remotely edible?\u201d He pulled his face close to mine. \u201cThat\u2019s what the Arcoses would do to you, as well as Seth and the other newlings.\u201d He shook me. \u201cGet it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon, let her go,\u201d Gilles said. \u201cHe is right, though, my dear. It is risky. We\u201d\u2014he motioned with his hands to his family\u2014\u201cwould certainly have to be extra-dosed by Preacher.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPapa, you\u2019re not seriously considering it?\u201d Eli said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her decision, not yours.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t even have to think about it. \u201cYes. It\u2019s what I want to do.\u201d I looked at Eli. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay. I want this over with, Eli. I want my brother back safely.\u201d</p><p>Eli stared at me in disbelief, then gave a cynical laugh. \u201cOh my God, Riley.\u201d He walked off, hands around the back of his neck. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let his temper worry you, ch\u00e8re,\u201d Elise said. \u201cHe\u2019s very protective over you, as you can see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBesides,\u201d said Gilles. \u201cWith the herbs out of your system for just one day, your blood won\u2019t reveal full potency. Maybe, though, just enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d I said, and gave him a sincere look. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>My internal clock had returned to my teenage schedule: out all night, sleep all day. Only, Eli was pissed, and he wasn\u2019t about to let me sleep all day. By noon he woke me up, angry, desperate to change my mind. He tried everything\u2014including sex. No, as potent as that was, my mind wouldn\u2019t be changed. He stormed off even more pissed than he had been before. We worked out in the donjon. He kicked my ass.</p><p>Preacher came by with a supply for the Dupr\u00e9s\u2014the third one that day. Talk about getting tanked. Phin held his washboard stomach as he downed another glass. \u201cI\u2019m too full.\u201d</p><p>I found that weird and hilarious at the same time. \u201cWow. Getting sloshed with unknown herbs just to keep from sucking my blood out. Nice.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. Luc grinned. Josie grinned.</p> <p>Eli remained unapproachable.</p><p>By nightfall, we were ready.</p><p>\u201cOnly one thing to do, ma ch\u00e8re,\u201d Gilles said. \u201cYou must wait to do it. Too early and you\u2019ll cause a frenzy that even my children, I and Elise, and your dark brethren may not be able to control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>He pulled a blade from my belt. \u201cYou must cut yourself and expose your blood. In its watered-down state it may not have the potency it usually does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I said, and nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait for Eli\u2019s word,\u201d he warned. \u201cUnderstand?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Loaded with silver and a body full of tempting O positive, I headed out with Eli. He was tense; anger boiled just below the surface, and it showed.</p> <p>\u201cYou do exactly as I say to do, Riley,\u201d he said, turning and glaring at me on the bike. \u201cSwear to God, you\u2019d better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I reassured him. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll wait for you.\u201d</p><p>We hit the Morgue and Asylum and came up empty before finding a place called Decay 11\u2014a punk joint in an abandoned garage off of East Broad. It was new to me\u2014not around in my teen years\u2014and I had to make a few calls to get directions. We found it in a plain metal building that had once housed an automotive oil and repair shop; the smell of stale motor oil still filled the air. Once inside, we noticed nothing unusual\u2014not at first. I\u2019d sidled up to the bar and overheard a guy on a cell phone talking about a party at Bonaventure\u2014a party not for chickenshits, according to him.</p><p>\u201cSounds like a bitchin\u2019 party,\u201d he said, glancing at me and grinning. \u201cYeah, they\u2019ve already headed out there. I\u2019m right behind you, dude. This place blows tonight.\u201d He closed his cell, pocketed it, and eased closer to me. \u201cHey, babe. Wanna go to a party with?\u201d</p><p>Not a bad-looking guy, with short-clipped brown hair and his eyes a nice shade of blue. I shook my head. \u201cThanks for the offer, but I\u2019m with someone.\u201d</p><p>He grazed a thumb over my jaw. \u201cToo bad. Bonaventure if you change your mind.\u201d He grinned and left. I watched him move through the crowd until he drew close to the door. I figured it was worth checking out, especially since we were running out of time. There was only one way into Bonaventure Cemetery after hours, and that was to sneak in. Over the black wrought-iron fence. I was glad this time I had on pants. No moonshine tonight.</p><p>Just as I was about to call Eli, he appeared. He moved his hand to my back and leaned close. \u201cI heard. Let\u2019s go.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cFor the record, that guy almost lost a finger.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t doubt it a bit. Outside, Phin and Luc met up with us\u2014Gilles, Elise, and Josie would meet us at Bonaventure\u2014and we headed down the sidewalk, climbed on the bikes, and headed toward the Wilmington River. We parked the bikes along Thirty-sixth Street, just before it turned into Bonaventure Road, and walked the rest of the way to the cemetery. The full moon, a large white lunar sphere, cast a hazy glow over the cemetery. At least it wouldn\u2019t be dead pitch-dark. Before we even reached the front gates, laughter rose from the river. \u201cThey\u2019re in the back near the river,\u201d I whispered, leaning against Eli. \u201cDa hell stone is back there.\u201d I looked up at him. \u201cWhy would they do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason,\u201d Eli said, grasping my arm. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s victory to them. Some weird little coup. Who knows?\u201d He glanced at me, his face stern. \u201cI don\u2019t like how this feels, and I damn sure don\u2019t want you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s over a dozen of them,\u201d I reminded him, \u201cand only six of you, plus me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe only need to kill two\u2014the Arcoses,\u201d Phin said. \u201cBesides, Preacher\u2019s boys are pulling in right now.\u201d</p><p>I looked, and sure enough, Preacher\u2019s van parked directly behind the bikes. Eight big guys ducked out of the vehicle and started moving our way. \u201cWell. Great,\u201d I said. \u201cMy Gullah grandfather is bringing a bag of dust to a vampire war. I feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s stronger than you think,\u201d Eli said. \u201cTrust me. He can handle himself better than you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right,\u201d I answered. It still worried me. Preacher was too old to be here.</p><p>Eli grabbed me and turned me to him. \u201cThis could get . . . ugly, Riley. Really bad,\u201d Eli said. \u201cDon\u2019t forget your promise to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I answered. \u201cI won\u2019t forget. I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s stare bored into mine. \u201cI can smell your nervousness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut can you smell my special blood?\u201d I asked, and hell yeah, I was nervous. I was like a cartoon steak with legs running around a pack of mouthwateringly hungry dogs.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The Dupr\u00e9s\u2019 Mercedes parked, and Gilles, Elise, and Josie got out and walked to meet us. \u201c\u2019Tis time,\u201d Gilles said, as though he\u2019d heard the entire conversation. He and Elise slipped away into the darkness. I\u2019d almost have to see it to believe it\u2014Gilles and Elise in a vamp brawl. Josie must have read my thoughts because she gave me a wicked grin.</p><p>I guess the partiers had jumped the fence to Bonaventure, just as I had that night not too long ago. But I was in the company of young, free-running vampires, and they leapt and scaled the gates so fast it made my head spin. I followed\u2014just a bit slower, with Eli right behind me. I was actually proud of my new skills\u2014even though they were much slower than the Dupr\u00e9s\u2019. Once inside, we crept along the iron fence toward the back, following the laughter coming from the river.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a bloodbath,\u201d Luc said, glancing around. \u201cI can feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re experienced, not like those newlings,\u201d Josie said. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for them.\u201d</p><p>As we walked among the graves, a half-moon filtered through the canopy of live oaks and dogwoods and caused long shadows to fall from the ancient headstones and marble statues of Bonaventure. A slight breeze grazed my cheek, and I noticed the moss swaying, could hear the sawgrass rustling at the river\u2019s edge, the water lapping the shore. Still no cicadas, or crickets, not even frogs. My skin felt icy, my insides cold. Like Luc, I had a bad, bad feeling. Eli must have read my thoughts, as his fingers found the small of my back.</p><p>We moved silently, and as I passed a white marble statue of a young girl, her arms outstretched, and the saddest expression on her face, I shivered. The way the shadows fell across her and added a menacing expression to her sadness? It seemed dark, terrifying, and . . . just not right. I\u2019d never been afraid of the cemetery, but tonight, I was leery. On edge. Cautious. Adrenaline ripped through me, penned up, anxious to be released.</p><p>You belong with me.</p><p>I twisted my head left and right, looking for the speaker of the words until I realized it had come from inside my head. It was him. Victorian. I\u2019d now recognize his voice anywhere.</p><p>Yes, it\u2019s me. A bloodbath can be prevented if you come to me.</p><p>I looked at Eli; he had no clue what was happening. Neither did Luc, Phin, or Josie.</p><p>Only you can hear my voice. Not the Dupr\u00e9s, nor your Gullah magic men. Just you, love. Your brother will die tonight unless you end it now. Come with me. I crave you, Riley. I crave your body. I know by your reactions you crave me as well. I have to have you. I vow you will never regret it.</p><p>I searched all around me; I saw nothing but the faint flicker of firelight near the river, menacing headstones, shadowy trees. My heart pounded fiercely, and Eli turned to stare at me.</p><p>\u201cI can hear your heart racing,\u201d he said, grazing my cheek. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I insisted, and after he stared at me for several seconds, we continued. The sultry, thick air tinged with brine hung like a mist over the gravestones; sticks crackled as they were tossed into the fire near the river; beer tabs popped, brew fizzed, laughter rose. We had to hurry.</p><p>You were meant to be mine, Riley Poe. You cannot resist me. I\u2019ve watched you in the dreams and felt your tremors of ecstasy. I made you come more than once. Do you remember?</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer him. I wanted to, but I didn\u2019t.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t matter. I can still hear your every thought. And while you make love to the one in front of you, you\u2019ll forget him soon enough. You\u2019ll know nothing but my touch, my tongue. Forever. I know you burn for me. I\u2019ve watched you.</p><p>Just then, chaos erupted around us. From the trees and crypts at the river, the hoodie boys leapt and swung and descended upon the group partying by the fire. The smell of pot wafted on a breeze. My insides froze as no fewer than fifteen kids moved like lightning, and I knew that Seth was one of them. The guys at the fire swore; one threw a can of beer. The kids\u2014newlings\u2014advanced, slowly now. Toyed with them. And then it began.</p><p>A hooded kid swung from a low-lying oak branch and dropped into the circle of partiers. With strength that caught me off guard, he grabbed a guy and yanked him up, and in the flickering firelight, I watched fangs drop from his jaws; his young face contorted, and he sank them into the throat of the screaming partier.</p><p>Then the screams began.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to move now,\u201d Eli said. He looked at me. \u201cWait for me.\u201d</p> <p>A melee broke out at the fire; as the group of partiers tried to flee, newlings leapt and chased, and behind them the Dupr\u00e9s closed in. Luc threw two newlings to the river, another far across the fire to a crypt. Josie fought a younger hoodie\u2014I somehow imagined it to be my brother, although I couldn\u2019t see his face. Phin rushed three hoodies at once, and behind him, I saw Eli. He moved fast, so fast my eyes couldn\u2019t keep up. He fought like a madman and threw three hoodies like rapid-fire rockets. I saw some of Preacher\u2019s kin step in; Gilles and Elise, as well. It was all so surreal, unbelievable; my legs turned rubbery. I couldn\u2019t move. The screams heightened.</p><p>Come to me, Riley. You can end all of this right now. I\u2019m here, to your right, across the stones. You can end the killing if you come to me. . . .</p><p>As if I had no control, I eased toward the right. I hoped and prayed that Eli would forgive me, but no way was I going to allow these young innocent kids to be slaughtered because of what they became against their will. No freaking way.</p><p>All at once, Eli, Luc, Phin, and Josie ran forward, into the mix of hoodies and pot smokers; Gilles and Elise joined them, and it was like watching a medieval battle scene. I wasn\u2019t going to wait another second. Not for the Gullah, or for Eli. He didn\u2019t realize that I no longer needed to cut myself to lure the Arcoses; I had one of them waiting for me. It didn\u2019t seem like the Dupr\u00e9s were stopping the bloodbath. It was up to me. In one fluid motion, I eased a silver blade from my belt, grasped it. I continued to move toward Victorian\u2019s voice.</p><p>That\u2019s right. Come to me. I am here, waiting for you.</p><p>I ran then, where I didn\u2019t know, but screams from the campfire rose into the night air and hung there, tormenting me. I glanced behind me and watched in horror as the newlings continued their rabid attack. Screams filled the night air, the sickening metallic scent of blood tainted the briny air, and bones snapped. God, I\u2019d been too late. We\u2019d all been too late. I stumbled through the darkness, up a long dirt path that led . . . somewhere. I didn\u2019t know anymore. I just wanted to lure the newlings away from the mortals, and Victorian would be the one to help me. Victorian, and my blood I knew Eli and his family would follow.</p> <p>Just then, a figure moved from behind a large oak. I stopped in my tracks; my breath shortened; my heart slammed hard against my ribs. I met his gaze as I grasped the blade and yanked hard. I hissed as pain shot through me. I had the most potent of blood sliding from my palm and landing on the dirt and gravestone I stood by. But my gaze became utterly transfixed on him. Victorian. I prayed the newlings would get a whiff of my blood and come after me.</p><p>\u201cI knew you would come,\u201d he said, and stepped into the moonlight. Like in the dreams, he was beautiful; he wore nineteenth-century clothing: dark breeches laced up the front, a billowy white shirt, and tall black boots, and his dark hair was pulled back in a loose queue. Moonlight spilled a hazed glow across the cemetery and cast shadows across his stunning face\u2014flawless, pale, just like in the dream. I felt catatonic, awed. He smiled, and his face became even more exquisite. He seemed a lot older than twenty-one.</p><p>\u201cLet us leave,\u201d he said, and held out his hand.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, managing to find my voice. \u201cYou said you could stop this. My brother\u2014the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Dupr\u00e9s have it under control. All will be well; I vow it. Now, let us move. If my brother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf your brother what?\u201d a dark, menacing voice said from behind me. He was so close, his voice racked my insides.</p><p>I turned quickly and faced another almost equally beautiful young man. Modern clothes, though. Dark hair, dark eyes, pale skin, but different all the same. Harsher. Merciless. That I could tell immediately. Silently, I screamed for Eli. Thankfully, he heard.</p><p>\u201cRiley!\u201d Eli\u2019s voice shouted from the river. I knew, even as fast as he was, he\u2019d never make it to me in time.</p> <p>Valerian\u2019s gaze suddenly shifted, his eyes rolled back, and he inhaled the air. Immediately, he spied my bleeding hand. \u201cThinking to keep this pet for your own, Tory?\u201d he asked his brother. Two sharp fangs dropped from Valerian\u2019s jaw, and he moved toward me, his eyes turning opaque, boring into me. \u201cHe never did like to share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Victorian shouted, and lunged at his brother.</p><p>Too late, Valerian had my hand to his mouth, sucking with all his might. Victorian pushed him off, and Valerian flew against a headstone. Before I could blink, he was up and advancing toward me, eyes pure white, no pupils. I reached for the blade jammed into my belt, and by the time I had it palmed, Valerian had grabbed my wrist so hard I felt\u2014heard\u2014my bones snap, and I gasped. The blade dropped, and pain gripped me, causing stars to flicker behind my lids. I had no time to move or shift; he had complete power over me. With one arm, he held me, and his mouth dropped against my throat. The moment his fangs pierced my skin, I screamed. They sank deep into me; I felt every inch, and my body convulsed. He sucked hard for all of three seconds.</p><p>Suddenly, Valerian was off of me. Eli stood there, facing him, his transformation complete, terrifying. \u201cLeave her,\u201d he commanded, and moved forward.</p><p>Valerian laughed and transformed, but he was different. Very different. Winged and silver skinned, he looked . . . hideous, not even humanlike, and he lunged at Eli; Eli lunged at him, and they met, midair, and fought. Valerian threw Eli against a crypt; he was up and had Valerian by the throat in under a second.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d Victorian said at my side, his voice darker than before. His eyes had also turned and were now staring at the holes in my throat left by his brother. \u201cForgive me. I . . . cannot resist,\u201d he said, and in the next second, sharp, long fangs dropped. Like his brother\u2019s, they pierced my skin and sank deep into an artery; I was completely powerless and in so much agony, I was paralyzed. He held my body against his tightly, almost like a lover\u2019s embrace, while he drank. One hand cupped my breast; the other held me intimately around the waist. His drinking of my blood was . . . different. His arms touched me lovingly, not brutally. I was dying just the same. I could feel it. I could feel Victorian\u2019s urgency in the way he suckled me. My breathing became more shallow, my heart slowed even more, and I fought to keep my eyes open.</p><p>Just as fast, Victorian dropped me, and I was shoved\u2014I knew it was hard, but I had no idea how hard until later. I just knew that I crashed against something solid. I didn\u2019t even know who did it. I lay there, my face pressed against the moist moss and damp pine straw of the cemetery grounds, my heart slowing, and my inhalations far apart. My vision became blurred, and the last thing I recalled was my body being lifted. Someone carried me, and I didn\u2019t know who. Through the haze of my vision I saw chaos: bodies on the ground, blood, tall dark men, opaque eyes, others in the shadows. I felt light, weightless, and my breathing became faint. I wanted my brother. I wanted Eli. Then, complete and total blackness engulfed me. Blackness, and excruciating, mind-numbing pain.</p><p>Part 10</p><p>TENDENCIES</p><p>Sad I am without you.</p><p>\u2014Anonymous epitaph, Bonaventure Cemetery</p><p>My eyes cracked open slowly, my lids so heavy they felt like steel weights sat upon them. I blinked several times to rid my vision and mind of the cobwebs. Everything was hazy, surreal, and my entire body burned. Like, my joints, my skin burned. Suddenly, I became fully aware of deep pain, and I cringed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d a desperate, deep, gentle voice said close to my ear. \u201cRiley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother her, boy,\u201d a familiar voice said. \u201cDat girl dere has been through it now, right? Shoo. I\u2019ll let you know if she wakens all de way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not budging, Estelle,\u201d the voice said.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d the familiar voice replied. \u201cOrnery today, dat\u2019s right. I\u2019ll be over dere seein\u2019 to my odder patients, den.\u201d</p><p>I forced my eyes to open despite the pain raging through my body. My vision cleared just enough for me to see the silhouette of a man. The longer I stared, the clearer my vision became. Finally, I saw pitch-black hair, pale skin. Beautiful. \u201cEli.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he said against my ear. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>Memories rushed back so fast, I felt dizzy. \u201cSeth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d Eli said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Relief washed over me in a heavy wave, and I exhaled. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he continued, and I felt his fingers stroking my arm. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I didn\u2019t want to sound like a baby, although it felt as though fire ripped through my veins. \u201cI feel fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a terrible liar, ch\u00e8re,\u201d Eli whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Estelle. She can get you something for the pain.\u201d His soft lips pressed against my forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t move; my body felt stiff and weighted. But my other senses worked fine, and I smelled . . . the salt water. Not old, briny air, but fresh, salty air. A breeze drifted over my face, and I felt the warmth of the sun beaming in through . . . something.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re at Da Island, baby,\u201d said another familiar voice.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cPreacher man.\u201d I tried to find his hand, but I couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>He found mine, and I felt his large calluses as he cradled my palm. \u201cYou know how to make an old man skip a heartbeat, dat\u2019s right,\u201d he said. \u201cI almost lost you, baby. If it wasn\u2019t for dat Eli and his brodders and sister, and his modder and fadder . . .\u201d He let the words drift off. \u201cI\u2019d take a stick to your backside if you was well enough.\u201d</p><p>I smiled again. \u201cYou can make good on that as soon as I can lift my own arms.\u201d</p><p>Finally, my fuzzy sight became clearer; I looked into Preacher\u2019s dark, handsome face. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I was on a cot in an open-air cabin on Da Island. Seagulls screamed overhead; the smell of the ocean engulfed me. It was like . . . heaven.</p> <p>Preacher looked down at me and tapped my nose. \u201cDat\u2019s a story for your Eli to tell. He was right dere after you passed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho threw me?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThat was me,\u201d Luc said, walking up. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever accused you of being a lightweight, huh, Riley?\u201d</p><p>I squinted through the filtered sunlight and smiled. \u201cSince I can\u2019t lift my arms, I\u2019m flipping you the bird in my mind,\u201d I said. \u201cThanks, Luc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo prob, cuz,\u201d he answered.</p><p>Estelle arrived with . . . whatever it was she concocted, Eli by her side. She gave me a sip of it, handed the cup to Eli, and left. He sat beside me. \u201cWhat do you remember?\u201d</p> <p>I thought a few seconds. \u201cEverything up until your brother tossed me,\u201d I said. \u201cValerian?\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s gaze hardened. \u201cDead.\u201d</p><p>Relief gripped me. \u201cVictorian?\u201d</p><p>Eli glanced away, then returned his gaze to mine. \u201cNot dead, but he\u2019s gone. Ned can\u2019t pick him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I answered. \u201cI remember seeing . . . bodies. Blood.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s face grew grave. \u201cSome of Valerian\u2019s newlings made their first kill on the guys down at the river. Six in all, and they escaped with Victorian. Phin and Luc cleaned up while we gathered you and the others to bring here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you manage that?\u201d I asked, trying not to think about the innocent boys whose lives are now those of monsters.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy. Newlings desiring their first kill are . . . tenacious. But we managed. They\u2019re all here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRiggs? Todd?\u201d I asked, then remembered a desperate mom on TV pleading for information about her missing son. \u201cJared Porter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re here, too. They\u2019re all fine, Riley.\u201d</p><p>Tears came to my eyes; I couldn\u2019t help it. They leaked out the sides and down my cheeks and into my hair, and I couldn\u2019t even lift a hand to wipe them. \u201cCan I see Seth?\u201d I asked, my voice trembling.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Eli said, wiping my tears with a finger. \u201cHis rehab is going to take a bit longer than yours.\u201d</p><p>My eyes sought his. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I move my body?\u201d</p><p>Eli knelt on the ground beside my cot and leaned close to me. God, I\u2019d never seen a more beautiful man in my life. I couldn\u2019t believe he was really mine.</p><p>A smile cracked his pale features. \u201cSo you consider me yours, huh?\u201d</p><p>I smiled back. \u201cYou jackass. I\u2019d smack you, but . . . why can\u2019t I lift my arms?\u201d</p><p>The smile faded. \u201cIt\u2019s been over a week, Riley, since that night at the cemetery. You were bitten. Both Arcos brothers\u2014they both drank. You collected some of their venom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s venom?\u201d I asked, horrified. \u201cYou never told me there was venom.\u201d</p><p>The slightest of smiles returned. \u201cYeah, there\u2019s venom. That\u2019s what causes the tendencies. You didn\u2019t get much, but you did get some\u2014from two very powerful strigoi vampires.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cSo . . . what does that mean? Am I paralyzed for life?\u201d</p><p>Eli shook his head. \u201cNo, not by far. It means you are going to have tendencies, Riley. You and Seth both will, but yours will be . . . different.\u201d</p><p>I thought of Ned Gillespie.</p><p>\u201cYeah, like Ned. Only . . . way different.\u201d</p><p>My mind whirled. \u201cCould you please let me finish my own thoughts and say them before you answer me?\u201d I asked with a smile. \u201cNow. How different?\u201d</p><p>Eli pulled his knee up and propped his arm against it. With his fingers, he played with my hair. \u201cOnly time will tell. It\u2019s too early to know.\u201d</p><p>I tried to let that congeal in my brain. It really was too much to take in at one time. So much had happened, and in such a short amount of time. \u201cAs long as my baby brother is safe, and okay,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m totally content.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally?\u201d Eli asked, and leaned closer. He dragged a finger across my bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cCan you kiss me, or is it too dangerous?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cDangerous for whom?\u201d</p><p>I smiled and gave him a somber look. \u201cThank you, Eligius Dupr\u00e9. You saved me. You saved my brother, and I will be grateful forever.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over me then, brushed my hair back, and cradled my face. \u201cI had no other choice,\u201d he said quietly, and lowered his lips to mine. He kissed me gently, as though afraid of hurting me. It was soft but possessive; it was a brand, and I relished it. Eli\u2019s unique taste and scent lured me, and had I not been paralyzed, I would have pulled him to me and never let him go. He raised his head and sought my eyes with his. \u201cIs that a fact?\u201d he asked, grinning.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I answered. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>His gaze grew serious and bored straight through me. \u201cMine,\u201d he said, matter-of-factly. \u201cYou\u2019re mine, Riley Poe.\u201d</p><p>My insides seized, and I didn\u2019t think a man could ever say another thing to me so incredibly possessive or romantic at the same time. I smiled.</p><p>Eli knew exactly what I was thinking.</p><p>Estelle\u2019s hoodoo medicine kicked in, and my eyelids grew heavy. I fell asleep with Eli\u2019s fingers entwined with mine, but even after my body slumbered, my brain continued furiously. At least, I thought it was my brain. At first. Until a familiar voice crowded my thoughts.</p><p>I will come for you, Riley Poe. That potency which rushes through your veins has lain against my tongue. It\u2019s inside of me. You\u2019re now a part of me, like my venom runs through you. We are meant to be together, forever. I will come for you. . . . </p> </body></html>"]
