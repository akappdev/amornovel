The flashing lights that shined brightly years ago have lost their luster, and that fresh feeling that once permeated the air\u2014that hopefulness, is long gone.</p><p>Every person I once considered a friend is now an enemy, and the word \u201ctrust\u201d has been ripped from my vocabulary. My name and reputation are tarnished thanks to the press, and after reading the headline that The New York Times ran this morning, I\u2019ve decided that tonight will be the last night I ever spend here.</p> <p>I can\u2019t deal with the cold sweats and nightmares that jerk me out of my sleep anymore, and as hard as I try to pretend like my heart hasn\u2019t been obliterated, I doubt that the agonizing ache in my chest will ever go away.</p><p>To properly say goodbye, I\u2019ve ordered the best entr\u00e9es from all my favorite restaurants, watched Death of a Salesman on Broadway, and smoked a Cuban cigar on the Brooklyn Bridge. I\u2019ve also booked the penthouse suite at the Waldorf Astoria, where I\u2019m now leaning back on the bed and threading my fingers through a woman\u2019s hair\u2014groaning as she slides her mouth over my cock.</p><p>Teasingly darting her tongue around my tip, she whispers, \u201cDo you like this?\u201d as she looks up at me.</p><p>I don\u2019t answer. I push her head down and exhale as she presses her lips against my balls, as she covers my c**k with her hands and moves them up and down.</p><p>Over the past two hours, I\u2019ve f**ked her against the wall, forced her to bend over a chair, and pinned her legs to the mattress while I devoured her pu**y.</p> <p>It\u2019s been quite fulfilling\u2014fun, but I know this feeling will only last for so long; it never stays. In less than a week, I\u2019ll have to find someone else.</p><p>As she takes me deeper and deeper into her mouth, I tightly tug her hair\u2014tensing as she bobs her head up and down. Pleasure begins to course its way through me, and the muscles in my legs stiffen\u2014forcing me to let go and warn her to pull away.</p><p>She ignores me.</p><p>She grips my knees and sucks faster, letting my c**k touch the back of her throat. I give her one last chance to move away, but since her lips remain wrapped around me, she leaves me no choice but to cum in her mouth.</p><p>And then she swallows.</p><p>Every. Last. Drop.</p> <p>Impressive...</p><p>Finally pulling away, she licks her lips and leans back against the floor.</p><p>\u201cThat was my first time swallowing,\u201d she says. \u201cI did that just for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d I stand and zip my pants. \u201cYou should\u2019ve saved it for someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Well, um...Do you want to order some dinner? Maybe we could eat it over HBO and go at it again afterwards?\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrow, confused.</p><p>This is always the most annoying part, the part when the woman who previously agreed to \u201cOne dinner. One night. No repeats.\u201d wants to establish some type of imaginary connection. For whatever reason, she feels like there needs to be some type of closure conversation, some bland reassurance that\u2019ll confirm that what just happened was \u2018more than sex,\u2019 and we\u2019ll become friends.</p><p>But it was just sex, and I\u2019m not in need of any friends. Not now, not ever.</p> <p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d I walk over to the mirror on the other side of the room. \u201cI have someplace to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt three in the morning? I mean, if you just want to skip the HBO and go for another round instead, I can...\u201d</p><p>I tune out her irritating voice and begin to button my shirt. I\u2019ve never spent the night with a woman I met online, and she isn\u2019t going to be the first.</p><p>As I adjust my tie, I look down and spot a tattered pink wallet on the dresser. Picking it up, I flip it open and run my fingers across the name that\u2019s printed onto her license: Sarah Tate.</p><p>Even though I\u2019ve only known this woman for a week, she\u2019s always answered to \u201cSamantha.\u201d She\u2019s also told me\u2014repeatedly, that she works as a nurse at Grace Hospital. Judging by the Wal-Mart employee card that\u2019s hiding behind her license, I\u2019m assuming that part isn\u2019t true either.</p><p>I look over my shoulder, where she\u2019s now sprawled across the bed\u2019s silk sheets. Her creamy colored skin is unmarred and smooth; her bow shaped lips are slightly swollen and puffy.</p><p>Her green eyes meet mine and she slowly sits up, spreading her legs further apart, whispering, \u201cYou know you want to stay. Stay...\u201d</p><p>My c**k starts to harden\u2014it\u2019s definitely up for another round, but seeing her real name has ruined any chance of that for me. I can\u2019t stand to be around anyone who\u2019s lied to me, even if she does have double D tits and a mouth from heaven.</p><p>I toss the wallet into her lap. \u201cYou told me your name was Samantha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. And?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour name is Sarah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d She shrugs, beckoning me with her hand. \u201cI never give my real name to men I meet on the internet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just f**k them in five star hotel suites?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you suddenly care about my real name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d I glance at my watch. \u201cAre you spending the night in this room or do I need to give you cab money to get home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas my question unclear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow...Just, wow...\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cHow much longer do you think you\u2019ll be able to keep doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep doing what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChatting someone up for a week, f**king her, and moving on to the next. How much longer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil my dick stops working.\u201d I put on my jacket. \u201cDo you need cab fare or are you staying? Check out is at noon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know that men like you\u2014relationship avoiders, are the type that typically fall the hardest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they teach you that at Wal-Mart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because someone from your past hurt you doesn\u2019t mean that every woman after her will.\u201d She purses her lips. \u201cThat\u2019s probably why you are the way you are. Maybe if you tried to actually date someone you\u2019d be a lot happier. You should take her out for dinner and actually listen, see her to her door without expecting an invitation inside, and maybe bypass the whole \u2018let\u2019s go f**k\u2019 in the hotel suite thing at the end.\u201d</p><p>Where are my keys? I need to go. Now.</p><p>\u201cI can see it now...\u201d She can\u2019t seem to shut up. \u201cYou\u2019re going to want more than sex one day, and the person you want it from is going to be someone you least expect. Someone who will force you to give in.\u201d</p><p>I pull my keys from underneath her crumpled dress and sigh. \u201cDo you need cab money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my own car, dick-face.\u201d She rolls her eyes. \u201cAre you really this incapable of having a regular conversation? Would it kill you to talk to me for a few minutes after sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have nothing more to discuss.\u201d I put my room key on the nightstand and walk toward the door. \u201cIt was very nice meeting you, Samantha, Sarah. Whatever the hell your name is. Have a great night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree times was more than enough. No, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings are going to catch up to you one day, ass**le!\u201d She yells as I step into the hallway. \u201cKarma is one hell of a bitch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I toss back. \u201cI f**ked her two weeks ago...\u201d</p><p>Contract (n.):</p><p>An agreement between two people that creates an obligation to do or not do a particular action.</p><p>Andrew</p><p>Six years later...</p><p>Durham, North Carolina</p><p>The woman who was currently sitting across from me was a f**king liar.</p><p>Dressed in an ugly ass grey sweater and a red plaid skirt, her hair looked as if it\u2019d been dyed with a box of crayons. She looked nothing like the woman in the picture online, nothing like the smiling blonde with C-cup br**sts, butterfly tattoos, and plump, pink lips.</p><p>Before I\u2019d agreed to this date, I\u2019d specifically asked for three separate proof of truth pictures: one of her holding a newspaper with the most recent date on it, one of her biting her lip, and one of her holding up a sign with her name on it. When I requested these things, she\u2019d laughed and said that I was \u201cthe most paranoid person ever,\u201d but she\u2019d done them. Or so I thought. With the exception of telling her my real name\u2014I stopped giving out my real name years ago, I\u2019d been completely honest and I expected that in return.</p><p>\u201cWell, now that we\u2019re alone...\u201d She suddenly smiled, revealing a mouth full of metal and rubber bands. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally meet you in person, Thoreau. How are you today?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t have time for this. \u201cWho\u2019s the girl in your profile picture?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is the girl in your profile picture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...Well, that isn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit it isn\u2019t you.\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201cDid you hire a model? Buy a bunch of stock images and use Photoshop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cI just thought you\u2019d be more likely to talk to me if I used that photo instead of my own.\u201d</p><p>I looked her over again, now noticing the strange unicorn tattoo across her knuckles and the \u201cLove is blind\u201d quote that was inked onto her wrist.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you expecting to happen when we actually met?\u201d This shit was boggling my mind. \u201cDid you think about what would happen when that day came? When I realized that you weren\u2019t who you said you were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was kind of expecting for you to have lied about your picture too,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that you would really look like you, you know? This is the first time a guy on Date-Match has told the truth. I think it\u2019s a sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cAnd the model? How did you get someone to take all those pictures?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a model. It was my roommate.\u201d Her eyes widened as I stood up. \u201cWait a second! All the things I said to you on the phone were absolutely true. I am interested in politics, and I do love studying the law and keeping up with high profile cases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat law school did you go to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaw school?\u201d She raised her eyebrow. \u201cNo, not law school type of law. Law like, I\u2019ve watched every episode of SVU and I\u2019ve read all of John Grisham\u2019s books.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and pulled a few bills out of my wallet, putting them on the table. I\u2019d wasted enough time with her.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Charlotte.\u201d I walked away, ignoring the rest of her apology.</p><p>The moment the valet pulled my car around, I slipped inside and sped off.</p><p>This shit is getting ridiculous...</p><p>This was the sixth time this had happened to me this month, and I didn\u2019t understand why someone would willingly lie with a potential face to face meeting on the line. It didn\u2019t make any f**king sense.</p><p>Annoyed, I picked up a bottle of scotch from the store across the street, and made a mental note to block this latest liar from my page. I was starting to feel like I\u2019d run out of available women to sleep with in Durham. I was also starting to feel like I needed to switch cities and start all over again; the cold sweats from years ago had returned, and I knew the nightmares were coming next.</p><p>As soon as I stepped into my condo, I poured myself three shots and tossed them back. Then I poured three more.</p><p>I scrolled through my phone and checked my emails for the day\u2014client referrals, more requests to chat from Date-Match, and a message from the sexy blonde I was supposed to meet this Saturday.</p><p>The subject-line read, \u201cHonesty is Key, right?\u201d</p><p>I tossed back another shot before opening it, hoping it was an invitation to meet tonight instead.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t. It was a goddamn essay.</p><p>\u201cHey, Thoreau. I know we\u2019re supposed to meet each other this Saturday and trust me, I was sooo looking forward to it, but I need to know that you\u2019re interested in me for me and not my looks. I\u2019ve met a lot of creepy guys on here because they just like my picture, and when we meet, they just want to have sex. I can assure you that I am who I say I am, but I\u2019m looking for something a little more fulfilling than casual sex. We don\u2019t have to have a full blown relationship, or engage in an intense affair, but we could at least build a friendship first, you know? I\u2019m looking forward to seeing you, so let me know if you\u2019re still interested in meeting me\u2014Liz.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I immediately clicked on my profile and opened the \u201cWhat I\u2019m Looking For\u201d box, making sure that it still read the same: \u201cCasual sex.

We can\u2019t be \u2018just friends\u2019?\u2014Liz.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHell no\u2014Thoreau.\u201d I signed off and blocked her address.</p><p>Another shot made its way down my throat, and I scrolled through the remaining emails\u2014immediately opening the one that came from the only person I considered a friend in this city. Alyssa.</p><p>Subject: Desert Dick</p><p>So, I\u2019m emailing you right now because I just thought about how much pain you\u2019re in currently...We haven\u2019t talked about you getting laid in quite a while, and that concerns me. Greatly. Like, I\u2019ve CRIED about your lack of pu**y...I\u2019m very sorry that so many women have sent you fraudulent pictures and given you a severe case of blue balls. I\u2019m attaching the links to a top of the line lotion that I think you should invest in for the weeks to come.</p><p>Your dick is in my prayers,</p> <p>\u2014Alyssa.</p><p>I smiled and typed a response.</p><p>Subject: Re: Desert Dick</p><p>Thank you for your concerns about my dick. Although, seeing as though you\u2019ve NEVER discussed getting laid, I think having Cobweb Pussy is a far more serious illness. Yes, it is true that so many women have sent me pictures, but it\u2019s quite sad that you\u2019ve never sent me yours, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m more than willing to send you mine, and eventually help you cure your sad and unfortunate disease.</p><p>Thank you for telling me that my dick is in your prayers.</p><p>I\u2019d prefer if it was in your mouth.</p> <p>\u2014Thoreau.</p><p>Just like that, my night was now ten times better. Even though I\u2019d never met Alyssa in person and our conversations were restricted to phone calls, emails, and text messages, I felt a strong connection to her.</p><p>We\u2019d met through an anonymous and exclusive social network\u2014LawyerChat. There were no profile pictures, no newsfeed activity, only message boards. There was a small profile box where information could be placed (first name only, age, number of years practiced, high or low profile status), and a logo on each user\u2019s profile that revealed his or her sex.</p><p>Every user was \u201cguaranteed\u201d to be a lawyer who\u2019d been personally invited via email. According to the site\u2019s developers, they\u2019d \u201ccross-referenced every practicing lawyer in the state of North Carolina against the board\u2019s licensing records to ensure a unique and one of a kind support system.\u201d</p><p>I honestly thought the network was bullshit, and if it weren\u2019t for the fact that I\u2019d f**ked a few of the women I\u2019d met on there, I would\u2019ve cancelled my account after the first month.</p><p>Nonetheless, when I saw a new \u201cNeed Some Advice\u201d message from an \u201cAlyssa,\u201d I couldn\u2019t resist trying to replicate my previous results. I read through her profile first\u2014twenty seven, one year out of law school, book lover\u2014and decided to go for it.</p><p>My intent was to answer her legal questions, slowly steer the conversation to more personal things, and then ask her to join Date-Match so I could see what she looked like. But she wasn\u2019t like the other women.</p><p>She sent me constant messages, and she always kept the topic of conversation professional. Since she was such a young and inexperienced lawyer, she asked for advice on the simplest topics: legal brief editing, claim filing, and exhibition of evidence. After we\u2019d chatted five times and I\u2019d grown tired of having three hour long info-dump sessions, I asked for her phone number.</p> <p>She said no.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I\u2019d typed.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s against the rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never met a lawyer that hasn\u2019t broken at least one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re not a very good lawyer. I\u2019ll find someone else to chat with now. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to lose that case tomorrow.\u201d I typed before she could end our session. \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really that upset about me not giving you my phone number? What are you, twelve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty two, and I don\u2019t give a f**k about your phone number. I was only asking for it so I could call and tell you that the brief you sent me is littered with typos, and the closing argument reads like a first year law student wrote it. There are too many mistakes for me to sit here and type them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brief isn\u2019t that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that good either.\u201d Before I could sign out of our chat, her phone number appeared on the screen, and underneath it was a short paragraph: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to call and help me, fine. If you\u2019re using my number to talk me into joining a dating site later, then forget it. I joined this network for career support, that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her message long and hard\u2014debating whether I should help her with no chance of getting anything out of it, but something made me call her anyway. I walked her through every mistake she\u2019d made, insisted that she clear up a few sentences, and even re-formatted her brief.</p><p>Just when I was about to tell her goodbye and hang up, the strangest thing happened. She asked, \u201cHow was your day today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not in your brief.\u201d I said. \u201cYou only want to talk about lawyer shit, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t change my mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Hang up.\u201d I waited to hear a beep, but the only thing I heard was laughter. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that it was such a raspy and sexy sound, I would\u2019ve hung up myself, but I couldn\u2019t put the phone down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, still laughing. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to offend you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t. Hang up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d She finally stopped laughing. \u201cI apologize for that hostile message I sent you...You\u2019re actually the only guy I\u2019ve met on here who answers all my questions. Are you busy right now? Can you talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout yourself, your life...I\u2019ve been asking you boring legal questions every day, and you\u2019ve been very patient so...It\u2019s only fair that we talk about something less boring for once if we\u2019re going to be friends, right?\u201d</p><p>Friends?</p><p>I was hesitant to respond\u2014especially since it didn\u2019t seem like the \u2018less boring\u2019 topics would involve sex, and she\u2019d said the word \u201cfriends\u201d so easily. Yet, I was in the middle of another sex-less night already, so I began to have a regular conversation with her. Until five in the morning, she and I discussed the most mundane things\u2014our daily lives, favorite books, her dream of becoming a late, professional ballerina.</p><p>A few days later, we spoke again, and after a month, I was talking to her every other day.</p><p>Tossing back another shot, I pressed the call button on my phone and waited to hear her soft voice.</p><p>No answer. I considered sending her a text, but then I realized it was nine o\u2019 clock on a Wednesday and we wouldn\u2019t be able to talk at all tonight.</p><p>Practice...Wednesday nights are always ballet practice...</p><p>\u201cMr. Hamilton?\u201d My secretary stepped into my office the next morning.</p><p>\u201cYes, Jessica?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Greenwood and Mr. Bach would like to know if you want to participate in the next round of intern interviews today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...\u201d She looked down and scribbled something onto her notepad. \u201cDid you at least look over the resumes then? They have to narrow it down to fifteen today.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and pulled out the stack of resumes she\u2019d given me last week. I\u2019d read through them all and written notes, mostly\u2014\u201cPass\u201d \u201cDouble Pass\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t feel like reading this.\u201d All the remaining applicants were from Duke University, and to my knowledge, we were the only firm in the city who accepted pre-law and law school applicants for paid internships.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t impressed with any of the applicants.\u201d I slid the papers across my desk. \u201cWas that the entire selection pool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d She walked over and placed an even larger stack in front of me. \u201cThis is the entire selection pool. Do you need me to do anything else for you this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides getting my coffee?\u201d I pointed to the empty mug at the edge of my desk. I hated that I always had to remind her to bring it; I couldn\u2019t function in the morning without a fresh cup.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019ll get that right away.\u201d</p><p>I turned on my computer and scrolled through my emails, sorting them all by importance. Of course, Alyssa\u2019s latest email was pushed straight to the top.</p><p>Subject: Get Over Yourself.</p><p>Thank you for the childish picture text of the white dust that was outside your condo this morning.

Why can\u2019t we meet in person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it would ruin our friendship and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve told me that you never sleep with the same woman twice, that after you sleep with someone you\u2019re done with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never f**ked one of my friends before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m your only one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware, but\u2014\u201d I stopped. I had no defense for that.</p><p>Silence lingered over the line, and I tried to think of another argument.</p><p>She spoke up first. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t want to ruin our friendship over one senseless f**k.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guarantee we\u2019ll have more than one senseless f**k.\u201d</p><p>Her light, airy laugh drifted over the line, and I sighed\u2014attempting to envision what she looked like. I wasn\u2019t sure why, but over the past few weeks, I\u2019d been longing to experience her laughter face to face.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d she went on, \u201cfor a high profile lawyer, you have a pretty dirty mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how much filthier it can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFilthier than what I\u2019ve already experienced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch filthier.\u201d I\u2019d been treading the waters since we began this friendship\u2014still hopeful that we\u2019d meet in person someday, but now that we weren\u2019t, there was no point in holding back. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll talk to you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless you find another date between now and then. I know you\u2019ll be searching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll be searching.\u201d I scoffed. \u201cIs Alyssa your real name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I\u2019m sure Thoreau isn\u2019t yours. Do you care to finally give it to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give it to you when you come to your f**king senses and let me see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just won\u2019t let that go, will you?\u201d She laughed again. \u201cWhat if the real reason I don\u2019t want to meet you is because I\u2019m ugly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a good feeling that you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if I was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d f**k you with the lights off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer the lights on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d make you wear a paper bag over your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHAT?!\u201d She burst into giggles. \u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous! Ugh, there\u2019s a client at my door right now. I have to go. Can I call you later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d I hung up, smiling. Then it hit me.</p><p>Fuck...She always finds a way out of that line of questioning...</p><p>Perjury (n.):</p><p>The willful giving of false testimony under oath.</p><p>Alyssa (Well, my real name is \u201cAubrey\u201d...)</p><p>\u201cLies always catch up to people in the end. Why don\u2019t people understand that?\u201d That\u2019s what Thoreau\u2019s text message said this morning.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think some lies are justifiable?\u201d I texted back.</p><p>\u201cNo. Never.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. \u201cSo, you\u2019ve never lied to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we barely know each other...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because you keep me at a distance.\u201d He sent me another text before I could respond. \u201cWould you like to know my real name and where I work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer our anonymous arrangement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do, and I\u2019ve never lied to you. I trust you for some strange reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome strange reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery strange. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>I tossed my phone into my purse and sighed, letting that familiar feeling of guilt wash over me. I\u2019d never meant to continue talking to him, to become his friend outside of LawyerChat, but I was in too deep, and I didn\u2019t want to let him go.</p><p>Months ago, when I\u2019d spotted the invitation to the exclusive network on my mother\u2019s desk, I swore to only use it when I needed to ask questions for my pre-law classes. I\u2019d used her access code to log in, built a fake profile, and made sure all the questions I asked were weaved in a way that no one would know that they were for homework assignments.</p><p>Unfortunately for me, the pre-law program at Duke was unlike any other program in the country. It consisted of more hands-on classes, one-on-one mentoring from practicing lawyers, and it was mandated that each student find an internship for the final four semesters. In addition to that, they expected us to read through and interpret case files like we were already lawyers.</p><p>If I had known that asking Thoreau for so much homework advice would lead to an actual friendship, I might have stopped talking to him sooner. Then again, just like I was his only friend, he was my only friend, too.</p><p>He was open and honest every time we spoke, and I only wished that I could be the same\u2014especially since he seemed to have a habit of saying, \u201cI hate f**king liars\u201d whenever one of his dates deceived him.</p><p>Damnit...</p><p>Smoothing the tulle fabric of my tutu, I took several deep breaths; I could think about my friendship with Thoreau later, right now I needed to focus.</p><p>Today was audition day for a production of Swan Lake and I was a nervous wreck; I\u2019d barely slept the night before, skipped breakfast, and showed up to the theater five hours early.</p><p>\u201cPlease clear the stage, ladies and gentlemen!\u201d The director shouted from below. \u201cThe official auditions will begin in thirty minutes! Please clear the stage and make your way to the wings!\u201d</p><p>Before heading backstage, I looked out into the audience. Most of the faces were familiar\u2014my classmates, instructors, a few directors from the ballet company I\u2019d worked for last summer, but the faces I needed to see weren\u2019t there.</p><p>They never were.</p><p>Hurt, I found a corner in the dressing room and called my mother.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d she answered on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t I where, Aubrey? What are you talking about now?\u201d She let out an exasperated sigh.</p><p>\u201cMy open audition for Swan Lake. You promised that you and dad were coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Aubrey, honey!\u201d She yelled to my dad in the background. \u201cYour recital was today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been in a recital since I was thirteen.\u201d I gritted my teeth. \u201cThis is an audition, a once in a lifetime audition, and you\u2019re supposed to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess my secretary forgot to tell me about it this morning,\u201d she said. \u201cHave you landed any internships for your major yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have two majors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPre-law, Aubrey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I sighed.</p><p>\u201cWell, why not? Do you think one is just going to fall from the sky and land in your lap? Is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had an interview yesterday at Blaine and Associates,\u201d I said, feeling my heart grow heavier by the second, \u201cand I have another one next week at Greenwood, Bach, and Hamilton. I\u2019m also about to audition for the role of a lifetime if you\u2019d like to pretend to give a f**k for five seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, young lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not here.\u201d There were tears in my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not here...Do you know how huge this production is going to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you getting paid? Is the New York Ballet Company running it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point.

I called and reminded you last night, and it would be really nice if my parents showed up and believed in me for a change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAubrey...\u201d She sighed. \u201cI do believe in you. I always have, but I\u2019m in the middle of a huge hearing right now and you know that because it\u2019s all over the papers. You also know that becoming a professional ballerina is not a stable career choice, and as much as I would love to leave my high-paying client to watch you tiptoe around on stage\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called dancing en pointe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame thing,\u201d she said. \u201cRegardless, it\u2019s just an audition. I\u2019m sure your father and I won\u2019t be the only parents who couldn\u2019t make it today. Once you graduate from college and get into law school, you\u2019ll see ballet for what it really is\u2014a hobby, and you\u2019ll be grateful that we pushed you into double majoring.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBallet is my dream, mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a phase, and you\u2019re way past the prime age for becoming a professional last time I checked. Remember how you suddenly up and quit at sixteen? You\u2019ll quit again, and it\u2019ll be for the best. As a matter of fact\u2014\u201d</p><p>I hung up.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to listen to another one of her dream-killing speeches, and it angered me that she\u2019d called ballet a \u201cphase\u201d when I\u2019d been dancing since I was six years old. When she and my dad had poured countless dollars into private classes, costumes, and competitions.</p><p>The only reason why I\u2019d \u201cquit\u201d at sixteen was because I\u2019d broken my foot and couldn\u2019t audition for any of the dance schools anymore. And the only reason I started to show the faintest interest in law was because I couldn\u2019t do much outside of my rehab sessions except read.</p> <p>My heart had always belonged in pointe slippers, and that fact would never change.</p><p>\u201cAubrey Everhart?\u201d A man suddenly called my name from the theater door. \u201cIs that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re next to take the stage. Got about five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe right there...\u201d I stuffed my bag into a locker. Before I could close it, my phone rang.</p><p>Knowing it was my mother calling to offer a half-assed apology, I tried my best not to scream. \u201cPlease spare me your apologies.\u201d I immediately picked up. \u201cThey don\u2019t mean anything to me anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was calling to tell you good luck,\u201d a deep voice said.</p><p>\u201cTwo minutes!\u201d A stagehand glared at me and motioned for me to head onto the stage.</p><p>\u201cThoreau?\u201d I turned my back to the stagehand. \u201cWhat are you telling me good luck for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mentioned having some type of audition weeks ago. It\u2019s today, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound too excited about your dream right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I be when my own parents don\u2019t believe in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re twenty seven years old.\u201d He scoffed. \u201cFuck your parents.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed, guiltily. \u201cI wish it was that simple...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt really is. You make your own money, and despite the fact that you don\u2019t really know shit about the law, you seem to be a pretty decent lawyer. Fuck them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d I said, trying to steer that subject away. \u201cI\u2019m shocked you remembered that my audition was today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d He hung up, and I knew he was smiling as he did that.</p><p>\u201cFifteen seconds, Miss Everhart!\u201d The stagehand grabbed my arm and practically pulled me onto the stage.</p><p>I smiled at the judges and stood in fifth position\u2014arms over my head, and waited for the first note of Tchaikovsky\u2019s composition to play.</p><p>There was a rustling of papers, a few coughs from someone in the audience, and then the music began.</p><p>I was supposed to demonstrate an arabesque, a pirouette, and then perform the routine that I\u2019d been rehearsing in class for the past month and a half. I didn\u2019t feel like it, though, and since this was one of my last opportunities to make an impression, I decided to dance how I wanted.</p><p>I shut my eyes and completed pirouette after pirouette, fouette turn after fouette turn. I wasn\u2019t even on beat with the music, and I could tell the pianist was confused and trying to keep up with me.</p><p>I demonstrated every jump I knew, perfectly landing each one of them, and when the pianist gave up and struck the last note, I returned to fifth position\u2014smiling.</p><p>There was no applause, no cheers, nothing. I tried to read the judges\u2019 faces to see if they looked mildly impressed, but they were stoic.</p><p>\u201cThat will be all, Miss Everhart,\u201d one of them said. \u201cWill Miss Leighton Reynolds please take the stage?\u201d</p><p>I murmured \u201cThank you\u201d before stepping off and rushing out of the theater. I didn\u2019t bother watching the rest of the auditions.</p><p>For the remainder of the afternoon, I walked around campus and tried not to cry. When I was sure that no tears would fall, I sent emails to Thoreau; that was the only thing that could possibly make me feel better.</p><p>Subject: Thinking...</p><p>\u201cOne dinner. One night.

And a \u201cfew\u201d reservations? What happened to just one?</p><p>Subject: Re: Re: Re: Thinking...</p><p>I told you I\u2019d make an exception in your case. I invested in a box of paper bags today.</p><p>\u2014Thoreau</p><p>I laughed and looked at my watch. It was five o\u2019 clock and I was sure the results for the production had been posted hours ago, but I was too scared to look. All I wanted was a chance to be a member of the swan corps, or even an understudy for the lead.</p><p>Why did I f**k up that routine? What the hell was I thinking?</p><p>After driving myself crazy with questions, I forced myself to make the trek back to the dance theater to look at the final cast posting. When I arrived, there was a huge crowd in front of the sign, and I could hear the usual \u201cI\u2019m in! I\u2019m in!\u201d and \u201cHow could they not pick me?\u201d revelations.</p><p>I squeezed my way through everyone and squinted at the sheet, looking for my name on the minor cast sheet but it wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>It was on the major cast sheet, and right next to the lead role of Odette/Odile, the white and black swan, was my full name in bold.</p><p>I burst into tears, jumping up and down in disbelief. I wanted to call my mom and tell her the good news, but my heart suddenly sank at the thought.</p><p>I knew that at this very moment, she was probably telling my father that I\u2019d hung up in her face, and that he needed to make sure I knew the strings behind them paying for my education: \u201cIf you drop pre-law, we\u2019ll stop writing the checks...Pre-law pays for your classes, ballet doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my aching feet out of a bucket of ice and patted them dry with a towel. I wasn\u2019t sure how I was going to juggle a leading role, classes, and a potential internship, but I didn\u2019t have a choice.</p><p>Sighing, I glanced at the calendar on my desk where I\u2019d scribbled \u201cInterview prep day\u201d in today\u2019s slot.</p><p>My upcoming interview with Greenwood, Bach, and Hamilton\u2014one of the most prestigious firms in the state, was more than just an interview. It was a process, and every intern-seeking student knew that landing an internship at that firm could do wonders for a resume.</p><p>The firm was so selective that they conducted four rounds of phone interviews, three online tests, and required each applicant to complete several essays before the final interview with the partners.</p><p>I\u2019d soared through the phone interviews and the exams, but the essays\u2014 regarding hundred paged case files, were something that I hadn\u2019t expected. I\u2019d even thought they\u2019d sent me the wrong packet so I called to say, \u201cI believe my packet was switched with the law-school level intern application.\u201d The secretary simply laughed at me.</p><p>She\u2019d said the firm expected all of its interns\u2014law school level and undergraduate level, to fill out the same packet to the best of their ability.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cWe\u2019re not expecting perfection from you. We just want to see how your mind works.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed the case file that was giving me the most trouble and placed it into my lap. Then I went to the GBH firm\u2019s website and familiarized myself with the three partners who would be interviewing me.</p><p>Greenwood, the founder of the firm, was a salt and pepper haired man with wiry framed glasses. He touted Harvard as his reason for being so demanding and thorough, and boasted that in his thirty years of practicing the law, he\u2019d attained one of the highest victory rates in the country.</p><p>Bach, partner of the firm for over ten years, was a bald man in his early forties, though he looked a bit older. He\u2019d worked his way up through the firm, and since he was \u201csuch a hardworking individual with unparalleled passion,\u201d Greenwood had no choice but to make him his first partner. He had one of the second highest victory rates in the country.</p><p>Last was Hamilton\u2014Andrew Hamilton, and he was...He was sexy as f**k. I tried to focus on his biography and ignore his picture, but I couldn\u2019t help it. His deep and piercing blue eyes were staring right at me, and his short, dark brown hair was begging my hands to run through it.</p><p>He had the face of a Greek God\u2014evenly tanned, perfectly symmetrical, strong and chiseled jawline, and his full lips were curved into a slight smirk.</p><p>Even though the picture only showed the top part of his body, I imagined that by the way he filled out his navy blue suit that there were hard and defined muscles underneath it.</p><p>I was getting wet just looking at him.</p><p>Focus, Aubrey...Focus...</p><p>Strangely, his bio was the shortest one of them all. It didn\u2019t list his education, his background, or the year he became partner. It was just a bunch of filler words about how \u201cthe firm was so honored to have such an esteemed and proven lawyer\u201d on their team. Oh, and he enjoyed eating chocolate.</p><p>How informative...</p><p>I copied and pasted all of their bios into a word document, and then I called Thoreau.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Alyssa,\u201d he answered, making me melt with his voice as usual. I swore he could talk me into doing anything\u2014almost anything.</p><p>\u201cHey, um...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>God, I loved his f**king voice... He hadn\u2019t said much of anything and I was already turned on.</p><p>\u201cYou called so I could listen to you breathe?\u201d He had to be smiling.</p><p>\u201cI did, actually.\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201cAre you enjoying my sounds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d enjoy them a lot better if you were underneath me.\u201d</p><p>I blushed. \u201cUm...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe case, Alyssa.\u201d He laughed. \u201cTell me about your latest case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, um...\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cLong story short: My client carried a gun into a federal bank and forgot to turn on the safety lock. Someone bumped into him and his hands instinctively went to his pocket, and the gun fired\u2014shooting him in the leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when do you practice criminal law? I thought your specialty was corporate.\u201d</p><p>Shit... \u201cIt is, it is. I\u2019m taking this case for a friend, pro bono.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm. Well, your friend is looking at two to five years in a federal prison if he doesn\u2019t have any priors. What part of this do you need help with exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pleading part. He didn\u2019t hurt anyone but himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he have a license to carry?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo...\u201d I looked through my notes.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m sure the prosecution will convince the jury that he carried that gun into the bank with the intent to harm someone other than himself. Take whatever deal they offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I...\u201d I looked at what the assignment sheet said. \u201cWhat if I already rejected that deal?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cCall the prosecution and try to get it back. If they say no, plead no contest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo contest? Are you out of your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you? What type of corporate lawyer agrees to take an open and shut criminal case? A fairly inexperienced one at that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor your information, it\u2019s an assign\u2014\u201d I coughed. \u201cNever mind. Telling me to plead no contest is pretty much the same thing as telling me to plead guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that was the case, I would have said plead guilty.\u201d He sounded annoyed. \u201cNo contest is your client\u2019s best option, and any real lawyer would know that. Are you sure you passed the bar exam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been invited to join LawyerChat if I hadn\u2019t, would I?\u201d I felt my heart ache with that lie. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to avoid my client being sentenced to prison.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you really should stick to corporate law.\u201d There was a smile in his voice. \u201cYour client is going to prison and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. The only negotiable thing about his case is how long he\u2019ll spend there. Anything else I can help you with? Do I need to lecture you on the difference between guilty and not guilty?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and put the file away. \u201cThank you for your condescending help as always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to ask you something important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout my case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He let out a low laugh. \u201cWhat do you look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I could barely hear my voice. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou heard me. Since I may never get a chance to see you, I\u2019d like to know. What do you look like?\u201d</p><p>I stood up and walked over to my mirror, letting my eyes roam over my reflection. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how I\u2019m supposed to answer that...\u201d I needed to change the subject, fast. From everything he\u2019d told me about his dates over the past few months, he definitely had a type he liked best, a type that intrigued him like no other: Blonde, slightly curvy, full lips...</p><p>Me.</p><p>I\u2019d tried to envision what he looked like plenty of times. Dark haired, maybe? Dirty blond? A mouth made for kissing with deep green eyes? Six pack, no, eight pack that leads down to a lick-able V?</p><p>He does mention working out every day...</p><p>I was more than certain that he was attractive\u2014he had to be if so many women put up with him on those dating sites, but each time my mind drew a picture, I\u2019d convince myself that I had him all wrong.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d I said, snapping out of my thoughts. \u201cI\u2019ve never been good at describing things. What do you look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look like a man who wants to f**k you.\u201d</p> <p>Tingles ran up and down my spine. \u201cThat\u2019s not a description...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat color is your hair?\u201d He didn\u2019t sound amused, and I knew he wasn\u2019t going to let me direct the conversation tonight.</p><p>\u201cRed.\u201d I yanked the band from around my bun and let the blond strands fall to my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cHow long is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s short...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm. What about your eyes?\u201d</p><p>I stared at my blue and grey irises. \u201cGreen, light green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have freckles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d At least that part was true.</p><p>\u201cAnd your lips?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to know how thin or thick they are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know how they\u2019d look wrapped around my cock.\u201d</p><p>I gasped.</p><p>\u201cAre you playing shy tonight?\u201d Ice cubes clinked against a glass in his background. \u201cHow much of my c**k do you think you could take into your mouth?\u201d</p><p>I remained silent, and my breathing began to slow.</p><p>\u201cAlyssa?\u201d His voice was soft. \u201cAre you going to answer me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to make a prediction about something you\u2019ve never done.\u201d I heard him inhale a deep breath, and the line went completely silent.</p><p>I thought he\u2019d ask me how I\u2019d managed to have sex with boyfriends in the past without ever giving a blowjob, but he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHmmm. Are you a natural redhead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d I moved over to my bed. \u201cI\u2019m clearly not your type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a preference, not a type, and a smart mouthed redhead who\u2019s never had another man\u2019s c**k in her mouth is more than worthy of an exception.\u201d</p><p>I hooked a thumb underneath my panties and peeled them off before slipping under the sheets. \u201cToo bad I\u2019m not a full blown virgin, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t f**k virgins.\u201d He paused. \u201cBut considering the fact that you and I have never f**ked, you might as well be one.\u201d</p><p>Wetness slipped down my thighs, and I felt my ni**les hardening. \u201cI highly doubt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of only being able to talk to you on the phone, Alyssa...\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI need to see you...\u201d His voice was strained. \u201cI need to f**k you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThoreau...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, listen to me.\u201d His tone was a warning. \u201cI need to be buried deep inside of you, feeling your pu**y throb around my c**k as you scream my name\u2014my real name.\u201d</p><p>A hand trailed down past my stomach and between my thighs, and my fingers began to strum my clit. Slow at first, then faster, faster with every sound of his heavy breaths in my ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been very patient with you...\u201d His voice trailed off. \u201cDon\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m tired of imagining how wet your pu**y can get, how loudly you\u2019ll scream when I suck your tits as you ride me...How hard I\u2019ll pull your hair when I bend you over my desk and f**k you until you can\u2019t breathe...Tired.\u201d</p><p>I shut my eyes, letting my other hand squeeze my breast, letting my thumb pinch my nipple.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you two weeks to come to your f**king senses...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s when you and I are going to meet face to face, and I\u2019m going to claim every inch of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t...I can\u2019t agree to...that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will.\u201d His breathing was now in sync with mine. \u201cAnd the second you do, you\u2019re going to invite me over and I\u2019m going to remind you of everything you\u2019ve teased me with over the past six months.\u201d</p><p>I was speechless. My clit was swelling with each rub of my finger, and my breaths were getting shorter and shorter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be gentle at first,\u201d he whispered, \u201cespecially when I slide my c**k into your mouth and pull on your hair, showing you exactly how I like it to be sucked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop...\u201d I was panting. \u201cPlease...Stop...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThoreau...\u201d My legs were trembling.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t just talk to you anymore. I need to feel you, I need to taste you. Say yes to two weeks...\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip, knowing that if he said it again, if he asked me one more time, I would say yes.</p><p>\u201cAlyssa...\u201d He was begging.</p><p>I was seconds away from coming, seconds away from screaming \u201cYes! Yes! Yes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll let me f**k you in two weeks...\u201d</p><p>As if my mouth was under his command, it freed my bottom lip and prepared to say yes, but I hung up.</p><p>Keeping my eyes shut, I lay in bed and let the waves of an orgasm roll through me as I screamed the three yeses he couldn\u2019t hear. When I finally stopped shaking, I rolled over and grabbed a pillow, pulling it to my chest.</p><p>Before I could force myself to sleep, I heard my phone ringing beneath me.</p><p>It was a text from Thoreau. \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes. Fourteen days.\u201d</p><p>Burden of Proof (n.):</p><p>The obligation to prove or disprove a disputed fact.</p><p>Andrew</p><p>\u201cDid I tell you that I landed the leading role for that ballet I auditioned for?\u201d Alyssa said to me the next morning.</p><p>I\u2019d been talking to her since I arrived at work, but I\u2019d made no mention of the fact that she\u2019d hung up in my face last night; I was going to punish her for that later. Severely.</p><p>Thirteen days...</p><p>\u201cDid I tell you about it?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>\u201cNo, and if you\u2019re not going to tell me when and where the show is, then I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, wow.\u201d She laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re mad about last night, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFurious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I hung up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know you screamed yes when you came, and you hung up because you didn\u2019t want me to hear it.\u201d</p><p>She was silent, and I was about to say something else, but Jessica suddenly stepped into my office, smiling at me.</p><p>\u201cHold on one second.\u201d I put my phone against my chest. \u201cYes, Jessica?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe final interviews are going to start in twenty minutes. They need you in the conference room now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get there when I get there.\u201d I acted as if the kiss she was now blowing me wasn\u2019t happening, and waited until she closed the door. \u201cI\u2019ll have to call you back later, Alyssa. I have a meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be bad timing for both of us. I have a meeting, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour doomed gunshot client?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, something much worse. An intern interview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be in the air then.\u201d I sighed as I slipped into my jacket. \u201cI have to sit through a few of them myself, unfortunately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny advice you want to share?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry to look like you\u2019re actually paying attention while they answer the questions, and make sure your cell phone is fully charged so you can get on the internet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for me.\u201d She laughed. \u201cFor the interns. Something I should say if one of them is nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cTell them my motto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what motto would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I ever ask you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I always tell you the truth.\u201d I hung up.</p><p>\u201cMr. Hamilton?\u201d Jessica stepped into my office again. \u201cThey want you to look over the files before they begin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right behind you.\u201d I followed her into the conference room, where Will Greenwood and George Bach were waiting, and I sat next to them.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you out of your office today, Andrew.\u201d Will laughed.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d George added. \u201cThank you for bestowing your presence upon us this afternoon. We know how much you love being sociable.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cWhy do the three of us need to conduct intern interviews? What\u2019s the purpose of having an HR department if the partners do their job for them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a family, Andrew.\u201d Mr. Greenwood spoke sternly. \u201cWhether it\u2019s an intern, the secretary, or the young man who stays overnight and cleans this office, I want everyone to feel like they\u2019re a part of a huge family. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not answering that,\u201d I said. \u201cHow many are we picking this year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too many.\u201d Will slid me a folder. \u201cWe have our top five picks. We just need to narrow it down to three. Two from law school, one from pre-law. We\u2019ll add two more next semester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d I pulled out the applications and pretended to pay attention as the two of them went over each applicant\u2019s achievements. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, Jessica!\u201d Will pressed the intercom button. \u201cYou can send in the first applicant!\u201d</p><p>When the door opened, I expected to see the usual plainly dressed stiff with a wooden smile, but the woman who stepped inside was far from that. Dressed in a light grey dress that clung to her hips and a pair of nude high heels, she was one of the sexiest women I\u2019d ever seen; I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off her.</p><p>Her eyes were a deep ocean blue that matched the sapphire necklace hanging around her neck. Her hair was pulled into a low ponytail\u2014the loose strands slightly grazed her br**sts, and her lips\u2014her bright pink, f**k-able lips, seemed to be mouthing words of some kind.</p><p>I have no idea what you\u2019re saying...</p> <p>As I was noticing the pink bra strap that had slipped from underneath her dress and onto her bare shoulder, her stunning eyes met mine. I raised my eyebrow and she blushed. Then she immediately turned away, looking at my partners.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to GBH, Miss Everhart,\u201d George said. \u201cWe\u2019re happy that you\u2019re here for an interview, but as you know we can only select one undergraduate intern for our program at this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, sir.\u201d Her eyes met mine again, and my c**k twitched.</p><p>I tried to stop the images that were flooding my brain, images of me bending this woman over the table, f**king her against my office wall, and tying her hands above her head and torturing her with my tongue all night, but they wouldn\u2019t stop. Each image dissolved into another one, and before I knew it, I\u2019d visually undressed her and there was no one in this room but the two of us.</p><p>What the hell is wrong with me? Attracted to a prospective intern? An UNDERGRADUATE intern?</p> <p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s get started then.\u201d George interrupted my thoughts. \u201cMr. Hamilton, would you care to start with the first question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly,\u201d I said, trying to ignore the fact that Miss Everhart was smoothing her dress over her thighs.</p><p>He nudged me under the table and whispered under his breath, \u201cFamily, Andrew...Family.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cWhy do you want to be a lawyer, Miss Everhart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI enjoy screwing people over,\u201d she said. \u201cI figure I might as well get paid for it.\u201d</p><p>My lips curved into a smile, and George and Will laughed.</p> <p>\u201cIn all seriousness, gentlemen,\u201d she continued, \u201cI come from a large family of lawyers and judges; it\u2019s what I\u2019ve known my whole life. I know the justice system is far from perfect, but nothing makes me happier than seeing it at its best. There\u2019s no greater feeling than working for the good of society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood answer,\u201d Will said. \u201cNow, we\u2019re going to ask you a series of questions regarding the real-world case study packets that we mailed you. Were you able to complete everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Question number one: Your client walks into a federal bank with a loaded gun in his pocket. Upon being brushed by a stranger, the gun fires\u2014shooting him in the leg. Regarding the charges that the prosecution filed, how would you have your client plead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I looked over at him. \u201cCould you repeat that question, Will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe prompt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you just asked.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and happily repeated it, putting extra emphasis on the crime of walking into a bank with a loaded firearm.</p> <p>My mind immediately flashed back to the conversation I\u2019d had with Alyssa last night.</p><p>I smiled, thinking that maybe Alyssa\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d was a headline story in the local news, that maybe I could figure out who she was without her telling me. I pulled out my phone and held it underneath the conference table, googling \u201cMan shoots himself in federal bank. North Carolina.\u201d</p><p>Nothing relevant appeared.</p><p>Hmmm...</p><p>\u201cHow would you make him plead, Miss Everhart?\u201d Will asked again.</p><p>\u201cNo contest,\u201d she said quickly.</p><p>\u201cNo contest?\u201d He sounded slightly impressed. \u201cWhy so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a license to carry, so I\u2019m sure the prosecution will try to make it seem like he carried that gun into the bank for a reason. Regardless of if he only hurt himself, he\u2019s looking at a prison sentence, so we could bypass the trial and try to limit it to the lowest terms possible.\u201d</p><p>I blinked, refusing to believe that her answer was anything more than a coincidence. As a matter of fact, as soon as she started to further explain her logic, I knew that it was; only a student would start talking about \u201cemotional appeal\u201d right after a no contest plea.</p><p>As Will and George continued to pepper her with questions, I googled variations of that federal gun case. \u201cMan fires gun in bank.\u201d \u201cNo contest plea in federal bank case.\u201d \u201cMan injures himself in bank shooting.\u201d</p><p>Still, nothing.</p><p>\u201cMiss Everhart, are there any lawyers that you wish to model your own career after?\u201d Greg asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, actually,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve always admired the career of Liam Henderson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam Henderson?\u201d I raised my eyebrow. \u201cWho is that?\u201d Usually, interviewees named a federal judge, a well-known prosecutor, or a familiar district attorney. But an unknown? Never.</p><p>\u201cWell, he made history as the youngest lawyer to ever uncover a government conspiracy, and he\u2014\u201d</p><p>I tuned out her answer. I\u2019d just thought of another phrase to google.</p><p>\u201cInteresting choice, Miss Everhart,\u201d Will said. \u201cDo you have any current mentors in the law profession besides your family members?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in close contact with this mentor? If so, how often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talk almost every day, so I\u2019d like to think that we\u2019re close.\u201d</p><p>Why isn\u2019t this case popping up? If it\u2019s a \u201cfederal\u201d bank shooting, it should be plastered all over the papers...</p><p>\u201cWould your mentor be able to speak to us, or send a letter regarding your character?\u201d Will was definitely impressed with this woman, and she had this job. The second set of questions he had yet to ask weren\u2019t really necessary.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I could ask him to do that if need be,\u201d she said just as I was starting a new web search.</p><p>\u201cGreat. So, tell us, what\u2019s the last bit of advice that your mentor gave you?\u201d</p><p>I looked at my watch. As soon as today\u2019s interviews were over, I was going to call Alyssa about this case. Maybe she\u2019d fudged some of the details to continue shrouding her identity.</p><p>\u201cWhen I told him I was nervous about my interview today,\u201d Miss Everhart said softly, \u201che told me, it is what it is.\u201d</p><p>My head immediately shot up.</p><p>\u201cDid he now?\u201d George clutched his chest, laughing. \u201cThat sounds like something our Andrew would say!\u201d He patted me on the shoulder. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Andrew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I narrowed my eyes at \u2018Miss Everhart.\u2019 \u201cThat sounds exactly like something I would say...\u201d</p><p>She tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to tell my mentor that someone actually enjoys his odd sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do.\u201d I watched as she answered the next questions with ease, as she barely blinked her big blue eyes when the questions became tougher. And the more I heard her talk, the more I heard the familiarities of her speech pattern, I had to force myself not to f**king lose it.</p><p>One coincidence was fine, but two? Damn near unfathomable.</p><p>As they asked her about her favorite inspirational quotes, I scrolled down to Alyssa\u2019s number and dialed. I knew for a fact that she never silenced her phone for some strange reason, and I had to know if what I was thinking was true, or if my mind was playing a cruel joke on me.</p><p>I could see the rings on my phone\u2019s screen, see the seconds as they passed, and when it rang three times, I let out a huge sigh of relief. But then the sound of bell chimes filled the room.</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry.\u201d Miss Everhart\u2019s cheeks turned pink and she picked up her purse. \u201cI have a weird thing about never putting this on silent...I really meant to leave it in my car.\u201d She pulled out her phone, slightly smiling once she looked at the screen, and then she hit ignore.</p><p>WHAT. THE. FUCK!</p><p>\u201cHappens all the time.\u201d Will laughed. \u201cWe were going on and on anyway. It\u2019s a good thing it went off so we can close out with the final questions. Anything from you, Andrew?\u201d</p><p>I glared at \u2018Alyssa\u2019. I was confused, pissed, and unfortunately aroused all at once.</p><p>\u201cAndrew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, noticing that she was blushing again. \u201cI have absolutely nothing to say.\u201d</p><p>Will and Greg both stood up and smiled, reaching out to shake her hand, but I remained seated.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe this shit.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t a green-eyed redhead like she\u2019d said over the phone, far from being a licensed lawyer, and she was a f**king liar...</p><p>\u201cMr. Hamilton?\u201d She was standing in front of me with her hand outstretched. \u201cThank you for interviewing me today. It was an absolute pleasure meeting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pleasure\u2019s all mine.\u201d I shook her hand, trying my best to ignore the smooth softness of her touch. \u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, said goodbye to the three of us once more, and then she left the room.</p><p>As Will and George discussed how impressed they were with her interview, I forced myself to look through her file.</p><p>Double major student at Duke: Pre-law and Ballet. Perfect 4.0 GPA. Recently cast as the lead of Swan Lake, recently listed in the top ten percent of her class. There were ten letters of recommendation in her folder\u2014all from impeccable lawyers; there was even one from the newly appointed assistant district attorney.</p><p>As amazing as her personal accomplishments were, it was her birthdate that stood out to me the most. She was twenty two.</p><p>Twenty f**king two.</p><p>And, even though she was the most accomplished out of all the undergraduates, she wasn\u2019t even a senior.</p><p>She was a junior...</p><p>I ignored Alyssa\u2019s text tonight, the one that read, \u201cIf you haven\u2019t found another unfortunate date for tonight, call me when you see this.\u201d</p><p>I was too angry to say anything to her. After all the hours we\u2019d spent on the phone, all the times that I\u2019d told her that I hated liars, she\u2019d lied to me. Repeatedly.</p><p>I\u2019d wanted to vote no for her employment, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it. Once we\u2019d finished with the last interview of the day, the decision on the top pick was unanimous: Aubrey Everhart.</p><p>Yet, while they frenziedly weighed the pros and cons of the other applicants, I sat there in a daze\u2014angry with myself for not seeing through all of Aubrey\u2019s lies earlier.</p><p>In the six months that we\u2019d spoken, she\u2019d always asked questions that were a little too simple, questions that sometimes made me wonder, but I never thought twice about it. She\u2019d mentioned Duke University a few times, but she never talked about it for long and she always made it seem as if she\u2019d graduated from there. But her constant talk of how she wanted her parents\u2019 approval and had conflicted feelings between choosing dance and the law should have been a dead ass giveaway.</p><p>At this point, I wasn\u2019t sure which lie to be more upset about: The fact that she wasn\u2019t a lawyer, the fact that she was still in college, or the fact that she\u2019d lied about her physical appearance.</p><p>Pouring my sixth shot of the night, I realized that that last lie\u2014although irrelevant in the grand scheme of things, was the one that hit me the hardest. She was definitely my \u2018type,\u2019 and the second she walked into that interview I wanted her, before I found out who she really was, before I found out her age.</p><p>Tossing back a shot, I heard my phone ringing. Her.</p><p>I rolled my eyes and let it sit on the table. I grabbed one of my last Cuban cigars and stepped out onto my balcony. I needed to think. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sky was starless tonight\u2014nearly pitch black, and the moon was hiding underneath a curtain of dark clouds. As much as I didn\u2019t want to admit it, tonight\u2019s sky bore a horrid resemblance to a certain night that occurred six years ago.</p><p>It was the night my life changed forever, the night that left me broken, shattered, and numb. All because of lies\u2014a series of heartbreaking and inconceivable lies.</p><p>I tried hard to prevent myself from picturing the memories, but I could still hear that strained, ragged voice in my head: \u201cAndrew...You have to help me...You have to get me out of here...Please... Save me, Andrew...\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and blocked out the rest of that memory. Unlike six years ago, I was in control of this situation, and \u201cAlyssa\u201d lying to me meant that our friendship was over, done.</p> <p>There was no justification for what she\u2019d done, but before I cut her off, I needed to make her pay for lying to me, and I needed to figure out how.</p><p>Conviction (n.):</p><p>A judgment of guilt against a criminal defendant.</p><p>Andrew</p><p>\u201cMr. Hamilton?\u201d Aubrey set my coffee down on my desk two weeks later. I\u2019d personally insisted that she work as my intern, even though looking at her made me angry.</p> <p>I\u2019d made a point not to say too much around her, to refrain from staring at her too long, and I couldn\u2019t help being crueler than ever\u2014dismissive even. I made her responsible for my daily coffee, demanded that she re-do every assignment at least three times, and whenever she asked for my help, I answered her with a detached \u201cFigure it out yourself.\u201d</p><p>She never seemed upset or offended by my harshness, which made me even angrier. I\u2019d thought that by having her work for me and seeing her crack under pressure that my attraction to her would fade, but it only intensified each time I saw her face.</p><p>Especially today.</p><p>As I pulled my coffee closer, I noticed that her ni**les were poking through her thin, beige dress, and it was so tight that I could see the imprint of lace panties.</p><p>Fuck...</p><p>\u201cMr. Hamilton?\u201d she asked again.</p> <p>\u201cYes, Miss Everhart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an important rehearsal for a ballet I\u2019m a part of, so I was wondering...\u201d She looked absolutely nervous. \u201cCan I go home early today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI really need to be at this rehearsal...It\u2019s at the Grand Hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, clearing her throat, \u201cwith all due respect, Mr. Hamilton, this is a pretty big deal for me. The Grand Hall is usually reserved for performances, so for them to open it and let us use it for a rehearsal is\u2014\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t listening, and as much as I wanted to look at my work again and make it clear that she was being ignored, I couldn\u2019t. I was too busy staring at the contours of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a fact.\u201d She was still talking for some reason. \u201cI think I\u2019ve made very valid points, and since I\u2019m not asking for too much, you should agree to let me go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet back to work, Miss Everhart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Hamilton, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet. Back. To. Work.\u201d I glared at her, daring her to let another word slip out of her seductive mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t care about your personal life. I pay you for twenty five hours a week, so you\u2019ll work twenty five hours a week, and you\u2019ll work them when I say you\u2019ll work them. So, get back to your cubicle.\u201d</p><p>She stared at me for a few seconds, and I couldn\u2019t help but notice tears welling in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou can take that box of Kleenex with you on your way out,\u201d I said.</p><p>Shaking her head, she stepped back and headed for the door. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask Mr. Bach if I can leave early. No disrespect to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I stood up. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>She continued to walk toward the door, the sound of her heels clicking faster and faster. Before she could turn the knob, I spun her around and slammed my hand against the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of insubordination, Miss Everhart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to worry about that anymore.\u201d Her face was red, twisted in anger. \u201c\u201cI\u2019m going to ask Mr. Bach to move me with someone else because I refuse to work with you anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that. No one else wanted you. Only me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI highly doubt that.\u201d She tried to move away, but I grabbed her hands and pinned them above her head.</p><p>\u201cI was the best interviewee and you f**king know it.\u201d She hissed. \u201cAnd since we both know that\u2019s a fact, I don\u2019t have to put up with your shit anymore.\u201d She looked as if she wanted to spit in my face. \u201cYou are a cruel, cold, and condescending ass**le, and I haven\u2019t learned shit from you; I doubt I ever will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your goddamn mouth. I\u2019m still your boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were my boss.\u201d</p><p>I tightened my grasp around her wrists and looked directly into her eyes, pressing my chest against her br**sts. \u201cLet me tell you what\u2019s about to happen, Aubrey. You\u2019re going to go back to your cubicle and you\u2019re going to stay there until you\u2019re done for the day\u2014only getting up to bring me a new cup of coffee. You will tell your ballet director that you\u2019ll come after you get your work done, and you will not go to Mr. Bach and say anything, because we don\u2019t reassign interns just because they cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess there\u2019s a first time for everything.\u201d She threw my glares right back at me, narrowing her eyes as her chest heaved up and down.</p><p>\u201cAubrey\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go before I scream, Mr. Hamilton. I wasn\u2019t listening to a thing you just said so I highly suggest\u2014\u201d</p><p>I crashed my lips against hers, effectively making her shut the hell up. I kept my hands tightly clamped around her wrists, pressing her body against the door with my hips.</p><p>She murmured as I slipped my tongue into her mouth, as I bit her bottom lip as hard as I could. Without thinking, I let her hands go and gripped her waist\u2014pulling her taut against me as my hand found its way underneath her skirt.</p><p>I slid my hand across the crotch of her panties, tapping my fingers against the lace, and then I slowly pushed them to the side and plunged a finger deep into her pu**y.</p><p>\u201cAhhh...\u201d she moaned, making me bite her lip again, making me use two fingers instead of one.</p><p>She was wet\u2014soaking wet, and as much as I wanted to f**k her senseless against my door and make her forget her name, I tore my mouth away from her.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out of my office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She asked breathlessly, her eyes widening in surprise.</p><p>\u201cGo to your important rehearsal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Ham\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry up before I change my mind.\u201d I reached around her and opened the door. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate to walk past me, and as soon as she was gone I knew damn well this arrangement wasn\u2019t going to work for too much longer. Either she was going to be reassigned or I was going to have to fire her, fast.</p><p>Hours later, when I was halfway through my work for the day, I noticed I\u2019d received a new text from Alyssa. I rolled my eyes and changed her name to Aubrey before reading it.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been for the past two weeks?\u201d it said. \u201cAre you okay? I\u2019ve called and texted you and you haven\u2019t said anything. I\u2019m really concerned...If you get this, say something, anything. \u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to respond, but with the taste of her mouth still lingering on my lips, I gave in. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Just made a major discovery not too long ago and I\u2019ve been trying to figure out how to deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it something serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVERY serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry...Want to know something that will make you feel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt anything you say can do that right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to bet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy boss just kissed the shit out of me. I think that\u2019s why he\u2019s so damn mean to me; he wants to f**k me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t think your \u2018boss\u2019 wants to f**k you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe definitely does. His c**k was rock hard when he was kissing me, and he was biting my lips and gripping me like he wanted to own me... I\u2019ve never been so wet in my life...\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. \u201cHow exactly is this supposed to make me feel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was pretending he was you the whole time. I miss you.\u201d</p><p>I immediately turned off my phone. I didn\u2019t know what type of shit she was trying to pull, but I wasn\u2019t falling for it.</p><p>\u201cI was pretending it was you? I miss you?\u201d Bullshit.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going to answer her calls or her messages for a long time. Sexy ass mouth or not.</p><p>Cross Examination (n.):</p><p>The interrogation of a witness called by one\u2019s opponent.</p><p>Aubrey</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the way Mr. Hamilton kissed me the other day, the way he pulled me against his chest and f**ked my lips with his mouth.</p><p>Thoughts of him kissing me had been invading my mind all day, and even now, when I was setting down his latest cup of coffee, I was tempted to walk behind his desk and dare him to kiss me again. Ever since I\u2019d become his intern, he\u2019d been quite mean to me\u2014reckless, but I thought it was a training technique, a way to see if I\u2019d quit under pressure.</p><p>Until he kissed me that day.</p><p>There was something intangible in his kiss; unspoken words, a repressed desire. It made me think that the glances he often tossed my way, those looks of scorn that were laced with wanting, meant a little more.</p><p>I placed a plastic stirrer into his cup and cleared my throat. \u201cDo you need anything else, Mr. Hamilton?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>I stood my ground and waited for him to look up at me; I wanted to see his face.</p><p>The suit he was wearing today\u2014a dark grey three piece with a silver silk tie, made him look even more devastatingly beautiful than he normally did.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem, Miss Everhart?\u201d He clenched his fists above the desk, trying his best to act like my presence wasn\u2019t bothering him. But it was, I could tell.</p><p>I knew he would look up at any moment, so I stepped back, making sure the light blue dress I wore specifically for him would be in full view, but he kept his gaze lowered.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen get out of my office. I\u2019ll need your Brownstein report with my next cup of coffee. Four o\u2019 clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just gave me that report yesterday. You said I could take all the time I needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must\u2019ve misheard me. You can take all the time you need today. Things change instantly around here, and that\u2019s the exact reason why some of us never leave early. Four o\u2019 clock.\u201d</p><p>I stood there completely speechless. There was no way I\u2019d be able to read and summarize a three hundred paged report by the end of the day.</p><p>\u201cDid you lose some of your hearing between today and yesterday?\u201d He finally looked up, his perfect face expressionless. \u201cI need complete silence when I work and I can\u2019t focus with your heavy breathing.\u201d He narrowed his eyes at me. \u201cGet out, finish the report, and bring it back to me with my coffee. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re fired.\u201d</p><p>I quickly decided that he was bipolar, and that our seemingly connected kiss was just a mistake. I turned around and left his office, rushing straight to the break room.</p><p>There was no way I was going to get that Brownstein report done by the end of the day.</p><p>I pulled out my phone and scrolled through my messages\u2014realizing that Thoreau hadn\u2019t responded to my morning texts. Sighing, I decided to call him. I needed someone to tell me that my life wouldn\u2019t end today when I was fired.</p><p>It rang once.</p><p>It rang twice.</p><p>It went to voicemail.</p><p>He hit ignore?! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sent him a text. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you lately?

There was no point in even attempting to finish that report. I was just going to sit here, relax, and when it was five o\u2019 clock I was going to collect all of my things and leave.</p><p>I could find another internship in two weeks, or worst case, ask the department chair if I could shadow my mother and father around their stuffy firm for credit.</p><p>Ugh...God...</p> <p>I shut my eyes and lay back against the cushion, wishing I could fall asleep.</p><p>\u201cAubrey?\u201d Someone shook my shoulder just as I was drifting away.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I opened my eyes.

Just come on, you don\u2019t want to make him angry.\u201d She held the door open and I stood up, making my way past her.</p><p>I debated whether I should even go to his office. Then again, seeing the look on his face as I said, \u201cFuck you. I quit.\u201d was too good of an experience to pass up. I forced a smile and knocked on his door.</p><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d His voice was stern.</p><p>I slipped inside, expecting to see him holding an empty coffee cup, but he was sitting at his desk\u2013glaring at me.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat,\u201d he said.</p><p>I sat in front of his desk, waiting for him to scold me about something, to unleash more of his seemingly bipolar tendencies, but he didn\u2019t. He just kept staring at me.</p> <p>I hated the effect he was having on my body right now, and as much as I wanted to ask him what the hell he wanted, I couldn\u2019t get my mouth to say a thing.</p><p>Without addressing me, he suddenly stood up and walked around his desk, sitting on the edge of it, letting his knees touch mine.</p><p>\u201cLawyers are supposed to be people with integrity, are they not?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you have integrity, Miss Everhart?\u201d He emphasized every syllable of my name.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cSo, would you ever willingly withhold the truth from someone you supposedly cared about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt depends...\u201d My breath hitched in my throat; my heart was racing a mile a minute.</p> <p>\u201cIt depends?\u201d He sat back a bit. \u201cIt depends on what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the truth would damage anything or hurt someone unnecessarily, then I believe I have a right to withhold it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if someone blatantly asked you for the truth, several times? What if he said, I want you to tell me the truth no matter how much it hurts, or how angry it may make me?\u201d</p><p>Where is he going with this? \u201cAre you referring to a potential witness changing his testimony on the stand, Mr. Hamilton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d He trailed his fingers across my collarbone, setting my nerves on fire. \u201cThis is a personal inquiry. I\u2019m just in need of an outside opinion. Answer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think\u2014\u201d I sucked in a breath as he placed his hand on my thigh and strummed his fingers against my skirt. \u201cI think certain lies have to be told, and certain truths have to be withheld. The ultimate conviction is up to those who can discern which is which.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you believe in reasonable doubt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn certain cases, yes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about in our case?\u201d His hand was slowly slipping underneath my skirt, traveling further and further up my thigh.</p><p>\u201cOur case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe you and I are currently in an unfortunate web of deceit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d I said, breathless and confused. \u201cWe\u2019re not in a web of deceit...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe definitely are, Alyssa\u2014\" He pulled me forward by the strand of pearls around my neck. \"It\u2019s the case of a woman who befriended me online, but she turned out to be someone completely different than who she told me she was. So, in this case\u2014our case, how do you feel about reasonable doubt?\u201d</p><p>Gasping, I could feel all the color draining from my face. My heart wasn\u2019t racing anymore; it was flailing around wildly\u2014ready to jump out of my chest, and my eyes were as wide as they could go.</p><p>\u201cYou were very good at covering your tracks for such a long time, so I\u2019ll give you that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I thought we thoroughly discussed how I felt about liars. Did we not?\u201d</p><p>I murmured as he tightened his grip on my pearls, as he pulled me so close that we were lip to lip.</p><p>\"Do you plan on answering me, Aubrey? Are you tired of this f**king charade?\"</p><p>\u201cI never thought that...\u201d I was stuttering, trying to look away from him, but his grip prevented me from moving. \"I am so sorry...\"</p><p>He didn't say anything further. He stared into my eyes, searching for something that wasn't there. Then he lowered his voice, and leaned back. \"Once someone lies to me they're dead to me forever. Do you remember me saying that?\"</p><p>\"Yes...\"</p><p>\"So, you\u2019ve always been willing to lose our friendship over lies?\"</p><p>\"I never wanted to meet you in person...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d He hissed.</p><p>\u201cIf I had known who you really were...\u201d I was breaking down in front of him. This was too much for one day. \u201cI would\u2019ve never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave it.\u201d He cut me off. \u201cI\u2019ve heard enough about your thoughts on lying. Seeing as though we don\u2019t share the same views, you\u2019re not worthy of being my intern. You\u2019ll be serving as my secretary\u2019s assistant until further notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re demoting me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a demotion. It\u2019s a way to keep you out of my sight.\u201d</p><p>My heart dropped.</p><p>\u201cOur online relationship\u2014whatever the hell that was anyway,\u201d he said, \u201cis over. I don\u2019t want to hear from you outside of these walls again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThoreau...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Mr. Hamilton, Miss Everhart.\u201d He glared at me. \u201cMr. f**king Hamilton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to believe that I\u2019m sorry...I never thought that this would happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake however much time you need on the Brownstein account.\u201d He disregarded my apology and released his hold on my necklace. \u201cYou have until the end of next week. And from now on, you can just set my coffee on my bookcase. I don\u2019t need you coming anywhere near my desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrew\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are definitely not on a first name basis. Do not ever call me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let me explain...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to explain. You lied to me and you no longer exist. Get out. Now.\u201d</p><p>I felt tears welling in my eyes. \u201cI was serious about you being my only friend...Friends are supposed to give each other a chance to make things right. Just let me tell you why I had to lie to you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deal with liars. Ever. And seeing that that\u2019s exactly what you are, I don\u2019t care why you felt the need to deceive me. Get out of my office, stay out of my sight as much as possible, and do your damn job.\u201d</p><p>I stood up and looked into his eyes, pleading for him to simply hear me out, to let me explain, but he turned away from me. Then he picked up his phone.</p><p>\u201cJessica?\u201d he said. \u201cCould you help Miss Everhart find her way out of my office? And could you please have the janitor check my floors for f**king superglue?\u201d</p><p>I stood underneath the scalding hot streams of my shower, crying. Right after I\u2019d left Andrew\u2019s office, I\u2019d told HR that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and needed to leave for the rest of the day.</p><p>I\u2019d driven straight for the dance hall\u2014locking myself into a private room and dancing until I couldn\u2019t feel my feet anymore. I knew I must\u2019ve looked crazy to my classmates, sobbing in between every twirl, but I didn\u2019t care; I needed to clear my mind of all thoughts of Andrew, Thoreau, and Alyssa.</p><p>As the water continued to lash against my skin, I shut my eyes and murmured, \u201cHow long has he known?\u201d I thought about the past couple weeks, how \u201cThoreau\u201d had been less talkative than normal, how he\u2019d ignored me, and then it hit me.</p><p>My interview...</p><p>I still remembered it because seeing Andrew in person made me realize that no picture could ever accurately capture how sexy he really looked, and I\u2019d blushed the second his eyes met mine. He didn\u2019t seem to act any differently throughout the questioning, but then I remembered that random phone call...</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure why I was just remembering it now, but while Mr. Bach and Mr. Greenwood had simply laughed that intrusive phone call away, Andrew had stared at me. As if he was in complete and utter shock. And at the end of the interview, when I\u2019d reached for his hand, his gaze wasn\u2019t intrigued anymore, it was heated.</p><p>Wiping away my tears, I turned off the water and stepped out. I wrapped myself in a towel and did what I always did when I felt sad: ordered a sandwich and made myself a couple of stiff martinis.</p><p>Just as I was downing the first one, there was a knock on my door. I noticed the pink Barbie keys on the counter\u2014courtesy of my forgetful and \u201cnever here\u201d roommate and knew it was her.</p><p>She always leaves something...</p><p>\u201cWould it kill you to double check for these before you\u2014\u201d I stopped when I opened the door.</p><p>It was Andrew, and the look on his face was one of pure anger. He wasn\u2019t dressed in a suit anymore, just a simple, thin white T-shirt that slightly clung to his chiseled abs and a pair of faded blue jeans.</p><p>I tried to slam the door in his face, but he held it open and forced himself inside my apartment. I started to step backwards and he matched me step for step, backing me against my living room wall.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d His voice was flat, emotionless.</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t. You said plenty earlier.\u201d I looked down at the floor. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be resigning in the morning. Please leave.\u201d</p><p>He tilted my chin up and looked into my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not quitting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d I swallowed. \u201cI want you to leave...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would believe that, but you say things you don\u2019t mean all the time.\u201d</p><p>The tension between us was damn near palpable, and I could feel my blood heating every second he stood there staring at me. I tried to move away, but he gripped my hips.</p><p>\u201cYou told me you were a lawyer, Aubrey...\u201d he said, his voice dripping with malice. \u201cYou told me you were twenty seven years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said I was twenty seven. You assumed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was on your f**king profile!\u201d He pushed my back against the wall. \u201cYou never thought to correct me whenever I said I was only five years older than you...I\u2019m ten years older than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I would ever meet you in person,\u201d I barely managed to say as he pressed his chest against mine.</p><p>\u201cThat excuses your lies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I was sorry, and it was clearly a huge mistake to ever befriend you. You didn\u2019t even give me a chance to completely explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not understand how f**ked up this situation is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d I murmured as our lips touched.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to f**king the woman who teased me every night for nearly six months,\u201d he whispered, sliding his fingers underneath my towel. \u201cI wanted her to ride me.\u201d He trailed his hand up my thigh and rubbed his thumb against my clit. \u201cOn my c**k and my mouth. And I wanted to teach her how to taste me...Don\u2019t you think this woman f**ked all of that up?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head in response; I couldn\u2019t handle the way he was looking at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou said you weren\u2019t my type when I asked what you looked like.\u201d He pulled away from my mouth, but he kept his thumb against my clit. \u201cBut you clearly are. Why did you lie about something as simple as that?\u201d\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me what you looked like, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop deflecting.\u201d He hissed, and took a step back. \u201cTell me the reasoning.

By the way, no self-respecting lawyer would ever let another lawyer do their work for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a self-absorbed ass**le who wants to seem deeper than he really is would call himself Thoreau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to finally see the version of you that I remember.\u201d He took another step back and crossed his arms. \u201cAnswer my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d I scoffed. \u201cI told you I was sorry, begged you to listen to me, and now when you feel like talking, you think you can barge into my apartment and make me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t made you do anything.\u201d He smirked. \u201cYet.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>He leaned against the wall, waiting for me to speak, but I couldn\u2019t get a word out.</p><p>Look away from him...Look away from him...</p><p>As if he knew the power his gaze was having on me, he grinned and picked up one of my makeshift martinis.</p><p>Lifting one of the cherries from the liquor, he placed it against his lips. \u201cDo you plan on standing there all night and looking at me, or are you going to answer my question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, finally looking away from him. \u201cAfter the way you treated me in your office today, I don\u2019t owe you a goddamn thing. You can stand there all night for all I care.\u201d I walked towards my room. \u201cThere\u2019s even a sandwich delivery coming if you decide to\u2014\u201d</p><p>My breath caught in my throat as he grabbed me from behind and pulled me against his chest. He quickly spun me around so we were face to face, and then he ripped my towel from around my body, letting it fall to the floor.</p><p>The cherry he\u2019d picked up was in his mouth, and he was pressing it on my lips\u2014silently commanding me to open up and eat it.</p><p>I stuck out my tongue to take it, but before sliding it to me, he whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t chew...I want to see how capable you are of swallowing.\u201d</p><p>My gasping did all the swallowing for me.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d he said, loosening his grip around my waist. \u201cNow, step back and hold the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He pushed me against the wall before I could take another breath, grabbing my hands and lifting them above my head. \u201cHold the wall...\u201d</p><p>I nodded, pressing my hands against the cool surface.</p><p>With a \u2018don\u2019t-fuck-with-me\u2019 look on his face, he sucked my bottom lip into his mouth, and spoke softly, \u201cI\u2019ll make you regret it if you let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a question.\u201d The look on his face softened, and I was sure he could hear the loud beating in my chest.</p><p>I shut my eyes as he ran his hands up and down my sides.</p><p>I could feel his c**k hardening through his pants as he lowered his kisses to my br**sts and swirled his tongue around my ni**les.</p><p>His mouth trailed down my stomach, and his hands caressed every inch of me as he made his way down.</p><p>\u201cThoreau...\u201d I gasped as his tongue skimmed the inside of my thighs.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Andrew.\u201d He got down on his knees. \u201cWe\u2019re done playing that game.\u201d He trapped my legs with his hands and pressed his mouth against my pu**y. Licking me gently, he massaged my clit with his thumb.</p><p>I tried not to moan too loudly, tried to keep it all in, but each time he swirled his tongue, my mouth let another sound escape.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so f**king wet...\u201d He groaned. \u201cSo f**king wet...\u201d He slipped two thick fingers inside of me, pushing them as far as they could go.</p><p>My eyes fluttered open as he added a third finger, as he whispered, \u201cSo tight...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhhh...Andrew...\u201d I gave up trying to be quiet.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d He slowly pulled his fingers out of me and looked up, waiting for me to say something, but I couldn\u2019t focus when he looked at me liked that.</p><p>With no lead-in kisses whatsoever, he buried his head in my pu**y and f**king devoured me.</p><p>\u201cOhhh...\u201d I cried out in indescribable pleasure. \u201cOhhh godddd, Andrewww....Waitttt...Slow down...\u201d</p><p>He ignored me, plunging his tongue deeper and deeper.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but let go of the wall. I dropped my hands to his head, grabbing fistfuls of his hair to keep my balance. The harder I pulled his hair, the more his tongue lashed against me with no mercy.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a loud knock at the door, but Andrew didn\u2019t bother stopping. Instead, he lifted my right leg up and draped it over his shoulder. He grasped my thigh so I couldn\u2019t move, and then he slid his tongue into me a little deeper\u2014licking every corner of my walls.</p><p>On the verge of coming, I grabbed his shoulders as my pu**y throbbed against his mouth. But he stopped abruptly.</p><p>He moved my leg and kissed his way back up my body, stopping when he reached my br**sts. He palmed them with one hand and roughly twisted my ni**les.</p><p>\u201cI told you not to let go of that wall,\u201d he said, looking down at me as he unzipped his pants.</p><p>I stared back into his eyes, nearly breathless.</p><p>\u201cI did tell you that, didn\u2019t I?\u201d He clasped my hand and pressed it against his chest, slowly moving it lower and lower.</p><p>When my hand finally reached his dick, I looked down in utter shock. He was huge, massively thick, and my jaw was hanging wide open.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d He tilted my chin up and smirked.</p><p>I was utterly speechless, but I couldn\u2019t deny how horny I felt right now. Remembering what he\u2019d said on the phone, I lowered my head to taste him, but he stopped me.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight.\u201d He pulled a condom out of his pocket, and kept his eyes on me as he put it on.</p><p>Leading me to the couch, he sat down and pulled me into his lap.</p><p>I leaned forward to kiss his lips, but he quickly repositioned me so I was facing away from him. Then he teased me with the head of his cock\u2014rubbing it against my slit. Again and again.</p><p>\u201cRemember how you said you wanted to ride me until I came inside of you?\u201d he whispered into my ear. \u201cHow you wanted to grind on me until I begged you to stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d I moaned.</p><p>He pushed me down by my shoulders and sank me onto his cock, burying himself to the hilt inch by inch. The further I slipped onto him, the more he groaned. The more he said my name.</p><p>When he was completely inside of me, he held me still and pressed his lips against the back of my neck, letting me adjust to his length.</p><p>The feel of him was like nothing I\u2019d ever felt before. It was intense, powerful, addictive.</p><p>\u201cRide me, Aubrey...\u201d He pushed me forward. \u201cFucking ride me...\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and rocked against him, slowly stretching my insides further and further. I could barely maintain a rhythm; the fullness of him was almost too much, and he was rubbing my clit with his thumb\u2014driving me insane.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so f**king good right now...\u201d He yanked me back by my hair. \u201cDon\u2019t f**king stop.\u201d</p><p>I held onto his legs to steady myself, slightly lifting my body up and down. I tried to finally establish a tempo, to finally take control.</p><p>\u201cAndrewww...\u201d I couldn\u2019t handle his c**k anymore. \u201cI\u2019m...I\u2019m about to cum...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He gripped my hips harder than ever. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>He suddenly stood up, with me still impaled on his cock, and bent me over. \u201cGrab that table and don\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>My fingers clutched the edge of the coffee table and he pounded into me again and again, smacking my ass each time I cried out.</p><p>\u201cI told you I was going to own your pu**y,\u201d he whispered harshly. \u201cDon\u2019t cum until I tell you to f**king cum...\u201d His c**k was throbbing inside of me, and my muscles were clenching with his every stroke.</p><p>\u201cFuck....Fuckkkk!\u201d My legs were starting to give out as an intense pressure built inside of me, as he f**ked me relentlessly. \u201cAndrewwwww...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let go.\u201d He warned, but I couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>My orgasm took ahold of me in a rush and I collapsed, falling forward. Before I could land face first onto the coffee table, he pulled me back and continued pounding into me until he reached his own release.</p><p>I shut my eyes and leaned back against him, panting heavily as we both tried to catch our breath. Several minutes later, Andrew gently lifted my hips and pulled out of me.</p><p>He stood up, and I watched him as he walked into the kitchen and threw the condom away. He picked my fallen towel up from the floor and walked back over to me.</p><p>I made no move to get up, but I re-wrapped the towel around myself.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you didn\u2019t lie to me about?\u201d His voice was a whisper.</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did miss you...\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrow, keeping the rest of his face stoic. Expressionless. He started to buckle his pants, not taking his eyes off mine.</p><p>I was hoping that he would say something, anything, but he didn\u2019t.</p><p>He smoothed his shirt with his hands and walked to the door. All of a sudden, he stopped and glanced over his shoulder. Then he walked over to me and lightly kissed my lips\u2014brushing his thumb against my cheek.</p><p>I wanted to speak, to ask what he was thinking, but he pulled away and left.</p><p>This time he was gone.</p><p>Recess (n.):</p><p>Temporary withdrawal or cessation from the usual work or activity.</p><p>Andrew</p><p>I\u2019d broken a lot of rules in my life, but sleeping with an intern was probably one of the worst ones. There was no precedent for this, and that terrified me.</p><p>The second I left Aubrey\u2019s apartment, I did what I normally did after f**king someone I met online: I went home, showered, poured a glass of my favorite scotch, and pulled out my laptop\u2014preparing to search for the next.</p><p>Except this time, I didn\u2019t want to search for a next. I wanted to f**k Aubrey, again and again. I wanted to hear her scream a little louder, feel her body wrapped against mine, and see her face as I buried myself deep inside of her.</p><p>Damn...</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe this. I could count on one hand the number of women I\u2019d thought about after I left a hotel, and it wasn\u2019t because any of them were memorable in a good way. And the ones that were good, were just \u201cgood\u201d\u2014never amazing, like Aubrey.</p><p>A part of me felt bad for leaving her right after we finished, for not saying a word, but I had to leave.</p><p>I didn\u2019t do pillow talk conversations after sex. Ever.</p><p>Even though I was more than tempted to drive back over there right now and claim her again, I had to make myself accept a very harsh fact: I was never going to sleep with her again. It was against my rules.</p><p>\u201cWhere is my coffee, Jessica?\u201d I called her desk. \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t Miss Everhart brought it to me yet? Is she late today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d She sounded confused. \u201cIt\u2019s only seven thirty...\u201d</p><p>I looked at the clock on my wall and sighed before ending the call. I was on edge for some reason, and I didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>I\u2019d failed to get any sleep the night before and I\u2019d purposely ignored Aubrey\u2019s midnight text. It\u2019d read, \u201cCan\u2019t sleep...Can we talk about what just happened between us?\u201d</p><p>The answer was no.</p><p>Our conversations were long over. There was nothing more we had to discuss.</p><p>We talked. We f**ked. That was the end of us.</p><p>I pulled up the Dating-Match website, determined to get her out of my mind. All I needed to do was find someone else, and she would become a drop in the sea of other endless women\u2014a fleeting memory that I would halfway remember whenever I saw her gorgeous face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There were hundreds of new women on the site now, but very few of them caught my eye. The ones that did seemed too good to be true, so I didn\u2019t bother clicking on their full profiles.</p><p>Just as I was reading about a math professor, a cup of coffee was set on my desk.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Aubrey whispered.</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer. I continued to scroll through online profiles; she\u2019d get the point eventually.</p> <p>She sighed. \u201cAndrew\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Mr. Hamilton.\u201d I looked up, immediately wishing that I hadn\u2019t. She looked even more stunning today than she did yesterday. She was wearing the same grey dress she\u2019d worn to her interview, and it was tighter today than it was on that day. Her hair was falling in soft curls that fell past her shoulders, and her blue eyes were bright, hopeful.</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you for a second?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIs it about your work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it about my work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen no. Get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about yesterday.\u201d She stood still, making my c**k stiffen as she bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cYesterday was a mistake, a regrettable moment in both of our careers, and I assure you that it won\u2019t be happening again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I was going to say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMiss Everhart,\u201d I said, standing up from my desk and walking over to her, \u201cyou and I work together professionally. If I had known the truth behind all of your ridiculous lies earlier, I would\u2019ve immediately stopped talking to you. And then I would\u2019ve reported you for stealing someone else\u2019s information and using it as your own. The fact that you are a liar remains, and unfortunately\u2014given those circumstances and the fact that I\u2019ve already f**ked you, there\u2019s nothing more that needs to be said between us.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to say something, but I pressed my finger against her lips.</p><p>\u201cNothing more,\u201d I whispered, bringing my face close to hers. \u201cUnderstood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are...\u201d Her bottom lip quivered as she jerked away from me. \u201cYou are such an ass**le! I can\u2019t believe that I slept with you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve it. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be a very good memory for you since you hardly ever have sex.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWere you pretending on the phone, too? You\u2019re nothing like the man I talked to at night, nothing like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease spare me the emotional appeal bullshit, Miss Everhart. I\u2019ll have my next cup of coffee at noon. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll get it when I feel like it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to make me fire you over a cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, you might not want me to make your coffee, Mr. Hamilton.\u201d She narrowed her eyes at me. \u201cThere\u2019s no telling what I\u2019ll put in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI f**king dare you...\u201d I stepped closer.</p><p>\u201cIs that a threat?\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a f**king promise.\u201d I pushed her against the wall and pressed my lips against hers, lifting her leg around my waist.</p><p>My c**k had been hard ever since she set down my coffee, and she was rubbing her hand against it through my pants right now, murmuring.</p><p>I pulled a condom out of my pocket and pressed it into her hand as I devoured her mouth\u2014biting her soft lips, teasing her tongue with mine. If I could, I would f**k her mouth all day.</p><p>As she unzipped my pants, I slipped a hand underneath her dress and pushed her panties to the side, groaning once I felt how wet she was.</p><p>\u201cAndrew...\u201d She was taking too long with the condom, so I did it myself. The second I had it on, I slid into her deeply, biting her lips so she wouldn\u2019t scream.</p><p>I grabbed her hands and placed them around my neck. \u201cAlways wet...\u201d I felt her trying to move her leg from around my waist but I held it still. \u201cSay my name again...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d She gasped as I pounded into her, over and over and over. \u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d I squeezed her ass.</p><p>Her murmurs were becoming louder and louder.</p><p>\u201cMy name, Aubrey...\u201d I kissed her mouth. \u201cSay my name...\u201d</p><p>Her pu**y was gripping my c**k tighter and tighter, and her nails were clawing my neck. \u201cI...I\u2019m about to...\u201d</p><p>I immediately stopped mid thrust and whispered harshly into her ear. \u201cSay my f**king name, Aubrey...\u201d</p><p>Her nails dug into my skin. \u201cAndrew...\u201d</p><p>At the sound of my name on her lips, I slid into her again and she came, so perfectly. I felt my own release seconds later, and could feel her burying her head in my chest to stifle her moans, but I tilted her head up.</p><p>\u201cStop that...\u201d</p><p>Panting, she kept her eyes on mine. \u201cStop, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHiding your voice from me...\u201d I kissed her lips again, making no move to slide out of her, and we stood there entwined in each other for what felt like forever.</p><p>As much as I wanted to tell her to leave and get the hell out of my office, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it. Instead, I kissed her forehead and slowly pulled out, readjusting her dress.</p><p>After throwing away the condom, I picked up one of her heels that had fallen off and held it out for her.</p><p>Her curls were tousled all over her head, so I smoothed them back into place. As if she was returning the favor, she refastened my zipper and fixed the collar of my shirt.</p><p>Then the two of us stood staring at one another. I had no idea what the f**k just happened, and only a part of me liked it. The other half loved it.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get back to work.\u201d I tugged at the ballet slipper charm around her neck. \u201cYou still owe me that Brownstein report, demotion or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me it wasn\u2019t a demotion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took a page out of your book and lied.\u201d I rolled my eyes and stepped back. \u201cGet back to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, Mr. Hamilton.\u201d She smiled and headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cAnd when you come back,\u201d I added, \u201cjust leave my afternoon coffee on that bookshelf and walk out. Don\u2019t come anywhere near my desk and don\u2019t say anything to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ll f**k you again if you do.\u201d</p><p>She blushed and stepped out of the room.</p><p>The second she was gone, I fell back into my chair and shook my head.</p><p>Twice in less than twenty four hours? Jesus...</p><p>I pulled up my latest case file, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to read it. All I could think about was Aubrey.</p><p>I\u2019d felt something like this before, and I knew it would lead to nothing but despair. What I felt was nothing deep, nothing all-encompassing\u2014yet, but it was real, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.</p><p>I\u2019d built the last six years of my life detaching myself from any chance of having feelings for someone else, refusing to build any friendships, but Aubrey had snuck by my impenetrable doors somehow. And not only had she snuck by, she\u2019d done it with lies, something I would never allow from anyone else. Something that would make me immediately discard her and never think of her again.</p><p>I had absolutely no idea how to handle this. This was uncharted territory and I had no idea where to sail next.</p><p>Sighing, I picked up my case file and forced myself to read the first few pages so I could get a grip on myself. Before I knew it, I was lost in my work, and the only thing on my mind was how I was going to convince a jury to believe my latest client\u2019s bullshit.</p><p>Before I could call the lead prosecutor and ask what he was offering in exchange for a plea deal, I felt something hot splashing into my lap.</p><p>My goddamn coffee.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d I dropped my papers to the desk, glaring at a red-faced Aubrey. \u201cDid you just throw that into my lap on purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d She nodded, and I realized there were tears in her eyes. \u201cBringing you your coffee is my job, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you f**king bipolar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m just a liar like you said. I\u2019m actually just like you, but at least I can admit when I haven\u2019t told you the truth, at least I have a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Tears fell down her cheeks. \u201cYou have a visitor at the front desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it your replacement?\u201d I asked dryly. \u201cBecause I swear to God, if these stains don\u2019t come out of my pants\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your wife.\u201d</p><p>***END OF EPISODE ONE*** </p> </body></html>"]
