Etiquette is ... well it\u2019s a fashion magazine.</p><p>So in essence, I\u2019m a music journo that works for a fashion magazine.</p><p>It was the first and only writing job I could land after finishing university. I majored in Popular Music Journalism. The two loves of my life always were, and still are, music and writing, in that order \u2013 so it was a no brainer for me what I wanted to do when looking at university courses after I finished sixth form.</p> <p>This job was meant to be a filler until I could get a writing job working for somewhere like NME or Rolling Stone, but six years later and I\u2019m still here.</p><p>My job at Etiquette is to write up reviews on new album releases, talk about popular bands and singers, and also do the odd interview, that type of thing.</p><p>I\u2019m a good writer, and even better at music. I grew up with music as my dad is a musician. He fed me it from the day I was born.</p><p>It\u2019s not my ideal job, working at a fashion mag, but I like Vicky a lot. We\u2019ve become really good friends. At first, when I started here I was just a column writer, but Vicky wanted me to keep working here and, with that and my constant nagging, she let me take my column and make it a full feature page.</p><p>That was a happy day for me.</p><p>It\u2019s been running for a year now and has been well accepted by the readers.</p> <p>The only downside of my job is that I have to keep the music mainstream as that\u2019s what the readers of Etiquette are in to.</p><p>I\u2019m not so much into girlie music, well, except for Adele, I love her, but basically I\u2019m more a rock, indie kind of girl. And all I want to talk about in my articles are rock bands, metal, indie, and brand new bands; bands that no one knows about who I\u2019ve come across in clubs. Bands that deserve a shot at the big time.</p><p>The good thing, recently, is a lot of the major rock bands have mainstreamed a little from their early stuff, to pull them into the Top 40, and now the gals who read Etiquette are listening to them, so it gives me the opportunity to talk about these bands. But still, it\u2019s mainstream, and I want to talk a little off the beaten track.</p><p>So for now, I\u2019m resigned to writing about easy listening.</p><p>But you never know, maybe one day.</p><p>I switch on my Mac, take another gulp of coffee, burning my tongue in the process and set off for the short walk through the open plan office, heading towards Vicky\u2019s office.</p><p>Her door is already open when I reach her office and she\u2019s on the phone.</p><p>She indicates for me to come in with a huge white toothy smile. I sit down in the chair across from her desk.</p> <p>Vicky is stunning. I would say she\u2019s mid-forties \u2013 although I\u2019ve never been able to get her to confirm her actual age \u2013 and believe me I\u2019ve tried. But whatever her age is, she looks like she\u2019s in her thirties and I can only hope I look as good as she does when I\u2019m her age.</p><p>Vicky has blonde shoulder length hair, trimmed neatly into a bob. A fantastic figure, and I\u2019m not entirely sure everything on her is real. But I love her. She is no-nonsense. Tons of fun. And an amazing businesswomen and writer.</p><p>She used to be a journalist for a magazine when she first started out. Then she met her husband. He was a wealthy, older, businessman. Very old school and didn\u2019t believe in women working, they were to stay at home with the children. Vicky loved him so she gave up her career for him.</p><p>They married, then Vicky discovered she couldn\u2019t have children. They didn\u2019t have the happiest of marriages after that.</p><p>She was the trophy wife. He was the habitual cheater.</p><p>He died ten years ago of a heart attack, leaving Vicky a very rich woman. His business is still going; I don\u2019t know much about it, something to do with acquisitions I think. I\u2019m not sure, and I don\u2019t think Vicky is either. It has a board and a CEO that run it, so when he died Vicky decided to stay well out of it, and instead took a chunk of the money he\u2019d left her and went back to her first love, magazines, and that\u2019s when she started up Etiquette.</p><p>It\u2019s a low priced, small magazine, a monthly, with a readership of 500k.</p><p>The magazine just about breaks even. Vicky doesn\u2019t make much on the magazine, she does it for the love and to keep busy.</p><p>She\u2019s determined to make it a success, and because she took a chance on me and gave me a job when no one else would, and also because I love her to bits, I\u2019m determined to help her see that dream come true.</p><p>She\u2019s a brilliant, vibrant woman, who was dealt a shit hand in life and she deserves happiness. This magazine succeeding will make her happy.</p><p>And you never know, one day, if the magazine grows huge, she might let me spin off and create an insert, music magazine.</p><p>Okay, well, I can dream can\u2019t I?</p><p>Finishing off her call, she hangs up, and grins at me, big hazel eyes alive, and I know straight away she\u2019s up to something.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, suspicious.</p><p>\u201cJake Wethers,\u201d she says, practically humming his name.</p><p>My heart sinks. I let out a light sigh.</p><p>Jake Wethers, one of the biggest rock stars in the world, lead singer of the hugely successful rock band, The Mighty Storm.</p><p>Who also, once upon a time, used to be my best friend.</p><p>We lived next door to each other growing up. We went to school together, did everything together, until he moved to America with his family when we were fourteen.</p><p>He was also the absolute love of my life, not that he ever knew that of course, and I was devastated when he left.</p><p>I don\u2019t have a single childhood memory that doesn\u2019t have Jake in it.</p><p>When he left with his family to move thousands of miles away, we vowed to stay in contact. But that was twelve years ago, when there was no internet or mobile phones for kids. Those were things solely reserved for adults, usually the ones with more money than mine or Jake\u2019s family had.</p><p>We wrote, had the odd phone call, then the calls from him stopped, and the letters dwindled until they became nonexistent.</p><p>I wrote to him for a while, but he never wrote back, so I gave up.</p><p>My heart broke for a long time over Jake Wethers. Well, if I\u2019m being honest, I don\u2019t think it actually ever really healed.</p><p>And I didn\u2019t see or hear from Jake again, well until six years ago...</p><p>I was two years in at university, sharing a flat with my still, to this day, best friend Simone, and she was watching a Saturday music show that used to be on back then. I was nursing a hangover, like most days, and was coming back into the living room, from the kitchen with a coffee in hand and there he was, Jake, on the TV, staring back at me.</p><p>He\u2019d grown obviously, looked a little different, yet exactly the same.</p><p>Covering my mouth with both my hands, I dropped my cup to the floor, coffee everywhere, but I didn\u2019t care. I stood there transfixed, watching him singing with his band.</p><p>I\u2019d heard about this new fast rising band, The Mighty Storm. I\u2019d even heard their songs on the radio, but I\u2019d never seen any pictures of the band members, until that point.</p><p>Simone was obviously interested to know why I\u2019d just dressed our living room in coffee, so I sat down and told her my history with Jake. Then we both immediately went to my room to Google him on my computer.</p><p>It made sense that Jake became a musician. He loved music as much as I did.</p><p>I knew he could hold a note vocally, but I never realised just how great a singer he actually was.</p><p>I\u2019ve watched Jake\u2019s career over the years. Watched him rise to stratospheric levels.</p><p>And I\u2019ve also watched his lows.</p><p>I still care for him, of course; he was my best friend for a huge portion of my life. We shared everything.</p><p>But I\u2019m not in love with him anymore. That ended years ago. And really, what do you know about love when you\u2019re a teenager anyway.</p><p>One thing I don\u2019t do is tell people I knew Jake growing up.</p><p>I\u2019m a private person generally, and I feel like telling people I knew him well would just sound a lot like bragging. And if my friends and colleagues knew I used to be so close to him, they\u2019d want details, and there are things from Jake\u2019s past that I know he wouldn\u2019t want shared, so, for fear of a slip up, I pretend like I never knew him and that I'm just another TMS fan.</p><p>Outside of that, and I know I\u2019m going to sound silly when I say this ... but talking about Jake would be like sharing him.</p><p>The world has him now, and I don\u2019t want to share the Jake I had with anyone, because now, well ... from what I see and read in the news, Jake\u2019s not so much like the Jake I knew back then anymore.</p><p>He\u2019s now the epitome of the rock star he is meant to be.</p><p>The only person I\u2019ve ever told about Jake is Simone, and of course my mum and dad knew Jake too, oh and ... well I also told Vicky, but that was in a complete, drunken error.</p><p>Last year I was ridiculously drunk at our work Christmas party, and for some unknown, alcohol given reason, I made the fatal error of telling Vicky that I used to know Jake.</p><p>And when I say fatal, it\u2019s not because she has told anyone about my connection to him. Oh no, it\u2019s because ever since she found out that we were former buddies, she has been on my back for me to get in touch with him to do an exclusive interview for the magazine.</p><p>What Vicky fails to grasp is that I\u2019m no longer friends with Jake, and haven\u2019t been for twelve years. It\u2019s not like I can just call him up to ask him for an interview.</p><p>She thinks I can. She thinks that Jake would be made up to hear from me. I know she\u2019s only saying that to try and urge me to get in touch.</p><p>But I won\u2019t ever get in touch with Jake. I think if he did want to see me again, then he would have been in touch himself by now.</p><p>Honestly, I think he\u2019s forgotten all about me. He\u2019s moved on to bigger and better things, and me rocking back up in his life, asking for an interview, would just be plain awkward and a lot weird, for him as well as me.</p><p>I\u2019ve done my best trying to explain this to Vicky, but it\u2019s not sticking, so I\u2019m now at the stage of dodging her whenever his name comes up.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Tru, have you listened to a word I\u2019ve just been saying?\u201d Vicky clicks her fingers, instantly bringing my focus back to her and I realise I\u2019d zoned out.</p><p>My face flushes. \u201cUm ... no sorry.\u201d I bite my bottom lip. \u201cIt\u2019s just the whole Jake thing ... I know you want me to get in touch but I just can\u2019t\u2013\u201d</p><p>She holds a perfectly manicured finger up halting my words.</p><p>\u201cWell if you\u2019d been listening to me, my darling, you would have heard that I don\u2019t need your help getting an interview with Jake Wethers after all.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s full on grinning, like a kid who thinks they\u2019ve just seen the real Santa Claus in Harrods.</p><p>Damn me and my zone out.</p><p>I sit up a little straighter in my seat. \u201cY-you got an interview with Jake?\u201d</p><p>She nods proudly.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I breathe out, dumbstruck.</p><p>Jake\u2019s well known for not doing interviews. Another of the reasons Vicky was so desperate for me to try and grab one with him. An exclusive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jake\u2019s intensely private. He talks about his music when he has to for PR of course. But he never talks about himself outside of that.</p><p>Which is funny, considering how he lives his life - very publicly in many ways \u2013 the drinking, the drugs ... the women.</p><p>Vicky shifts uncomfortably in her seat and grimaces slightly. \u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter how I got it \u2013 just that I did and you\u2019re going to do the interview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d I almost reel backwards off my chair.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so surprised. You\u2019re my best writer, Tru, and well ... you\u2019re my only music writer. And you have this huge connection with Jake, you grew up together for crying out loud! He\u2019ll open up to you more than he would anyone else. You could land us an exclusive here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d I\u2019m shaking my head, rapidly. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a good idea.\u201d</p><p>I might be a journo, but I do have this thing called morals. I\u2019m not going to spread Jake\u2019s guts all over the magazine in the name of news.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an excellent idea, and we need this, Tru.\u201d Her normally smooth features furrow. \u201cSales are rubbish at the moment, and this exclusive with Jake Wethers will give us the boost we\u2019ve been waiting for.\u201d</p><p>Ugh. She\u2019s right. It will be good for the magazine, no, scrap that, it will be amazing for the magazine.</p> <p>All I need to do is get a great interview from Jake and keep my morals at the same time.</p><p>Holy fuck! Is this really happening? Am I really going to see Jake again after all this time?</p><p>A frisson of nervous energy passes through me.</p><p>He probably won\u2019t even remember me. It\u2019s been twelve years.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d Vicky smiles, clapping her hands together.</p> <p>\u201cWhen and where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, 10am, at The Dorchester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d I feel another, much larger, shot of nerves rush through my blood.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s only here in the UK for a few days. This is the only window we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay ... should I book Jim to go with me?\u201d Jim is our photographer.</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo pictures. We\u2019re to use old press photos. You\u2019re going in solo, gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>Crap. I was hoping for the back-up.</p><p>I swallow down the nerves ramming up my throat and nod. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so nervous, you\u2019ll do great, Tru. Oh, and here\u2019s a review copy of the new album\u2013\u201d She picks a CD case up from her desk and peers down at it, reading. \u201c\u2013 Creed ... ahh,\u201d she murmurs knowingly. \u201c...anyway, have a listen before the interview, and it\u2019s not released yet, so remember\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuard it with my life.\u201d I take the CD from her and start to walk away.</p><p>\u201cI bet he\u2019ll be delighted to see you,\u201d she sings from behind me.</p><p>I look at her over my shoulder, pulling a face at her, I stick my tongue out.</p><p>She laughs. \u201cWell maybe not with a face like that he won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I grin, and then with my new Mighty Storm CD, and the heavy weight of the interview on my shoulders, I amble out of her office.</p><p>I slump down in my chair at my desk and look at the CD in my hand.</p><p>Okay, so tomorrow, at 10am, I\u2019m going to see Jake for the first time in twelve years.</p><p>Jake Wethers, the man who used to be the boy I loved.</p><p>Jake Wethers the biggest rock star, and most wanted man in the world, tomorrow will be sitting before me giving me an interview, and I haven\u2019t got a bloody clue what I\u2019m going to ask to him.</p><p>I put Jake\u2019s album into the disc holder in my Mac, plug my headphones in and start to listen as the music flows into my ears.</p><p>I pull the insert booklet out and start to read through the track listings. Then I flick to the back page to read the dedications.</p><p>There\u2019s one person I know, without doubt, who this album is dedicated too.</p><p>The person who co-wrote the album, and who it\u2019s named after \u2013 Jonny Creed.</p><p>Jonny was Jake\u2019s best-friend, lead guitarist in TMS, and his business partner, and he died in a car accident a little over a year ago.</p><p>Jonny\u2019s car crashed through a barrier then rolled down a steep ravine in LA not far from where he lived.</p><p>I saw the pictures in the news the next day after it happened. His car was totalled.</p><p>He never stood a chance.</p><p>There were no other cars involved in the accident, and after the autopsy was done it was revealed that Jonny was way over the legal alcohol limit, and the level of drugs in his system was enough to take down a small horse, or so it had been reported.</p><p>The accident happened late at night, and the police said Jonny could have been swerving to avoid an animal in the road, or maybe, because of the alcohol and drugs, he could have fallen asleep at the wheel, though there\u2019s no evidence to prove either to be the case.</p><p>The press have speculated that it was a suicide. But the bands spokespeople have vehemently denied it, and there was no evidence to show that Jonny was depressed in anyway at all.</p><p>His life was good. He was at the top of his game. He had everything to live for.</p><p>The band took his death badly. Jake even more so. And his pain was splashed all over the pages of the press for the world to see.</p><p>Jake upped his drinking and his drugs, and then fell in the worst possible way when on stage in Japan eight months after Jonny\u2019s death.</p><p>It was the band\u2019s first show since Jonny\u2019s death. Jake was wrecked. He could barely talk, let alone sing. When the crowd got antsy at the poor show, he berated them. When they heckled, he unbuttoned his jeans and urinated on the stage.</p><p>He was arrested for public indecency.</p><p>I saw the clips of the show after it happened. It burned my heart to watch.</p><p>He was so far from the Jake I had seen over the years in the press, and even further from the Jake I remembered and once loved.</p><p>He was lost to grief, trying to bury it with drugs and drink. And for that one moment he lost control.</p><p>It could have ruined his career.</p><p>Luckily for him it didn\u2019t. If anything, it only catapulted his status higher and the world\u2019s obsession with him further.</p><p>He is the ultimate bad boy of rock.</p><p>Jake was fined for his behaviour in Japan and thrown out of the country. Soon afterwards he went into rehab.</p><p>He\u2019s spent four months in rehab and has been out for the last four weeks, and is still maintaining a low profile.</p><p>But I know that\u2019s soon to change, hence the interview, as the band has the album, which Jake and Jonny wrote together, to release and promote.</p><p>For a while there was a worry among the fans that the band wouldn\u2019t go on when Jonny died, but from the press release that TMS put out a month ago, shortly after Jake got out of rehab, they said the band was Jonny's life and love, and that this album, his last and now his legacy, was his best to date. And also that if they didn\u2019t put the album out, Jonny would more than likely come back to kick their asses for quitting now.</p><p>And this is not me being cynical, I just understand the music business, and well ... basically the band is what keeps the music label riding high, and you see Jake owns the label that TMS are signed to; if it\u2019s possible to sign the band you are in.</p><p>But basically, if the label falls because the band quits, then that\u2019s an awful lot of people out of work.</p><p>When TMS first started out they were signed to a small label, \u2018Rally Records\u2019, but as the band rapidly grew, becoming one of the fastest growing bands ever and breaking sales records worldwide, basically becoming a phenomena, Jake grew too. And him and the guys soon outgrew the small label they were signed to.</p><p>It\u2019s well documented that Jake is a shrewd businessman for his young age, and a serious professional, barring his drug and alcohol addiction, and the pissing on the crowd incident. It's also widely reported that he is notoriously difficult to work with.</p><p>Apparently, he was once quoted in the press as saying, \u2018When you\u2019re the best like I am, and give only the best, why is it so wrong to expect the same in return.\u2019</p><p>That, I can believe. Because that reminds me a lot of the Jake I knew. Never one to mince his words or hold back from sharing his thoughts.</p><p>So when the band felt they were too big for Rally anymore, they walked away from the label, buying themselves out of their contract.</p><p>The figure has never been reported. But I\u2019m in no doubt they could have afforded it.</p><p>Jake is rumoured to be worth around $300 million and growing, they say he earned $90 million in the last year alone.</p><p>So when they left Rally, Jake and Jonny set up \u2018TMS Records\u2019 together, put the band onto the label and have been signing other growing bands and musicians to the label ever since.</p><p>Well, until Jonny died that is.</p><p>When Jonny died his half of the label naturally went to his parents. It was reported that Jake bought them out, as per their wishes, because it was too painful for them to have any involvement with the label after losing Jonny.</p><p>So now Jake runs TMS alone. And even in rehab, he had maintained running it from what I\u2019ve heard in the business news.</p><p>But even with Jake\u2019s combination of music and business talent, it is sadly not what he spends most of his time in the news for.</p><p>Pissing on the stage in Japan aside, Jake was already tabloid fodder for his drinking, partying, and women. He works hard, and plays harder. He goes through women like most people go through loose change. He has dated some of the most beautiful women in the world. Actresses, models, singers, the list goes on and on.</p><p>More recently, he\u2019s been quiet on that front, obviously from being in rehab. But now he\u2019s back, clean and ready to reclaim his place in the news, and the charts.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s how Vicky got the interview.</p><p>Jake will be keen to show he\u2019s back and means business. If anything, surprisingly, Jake and TMS\u2019s popularity has increased since the Japan incident.</p><p>The fans love his outlandish behaviour. Men want to be him, woman want to screw him ... most wanting to be the one to tame the untameable Jake Wethers.</p><p>All Jake did that night in Japan was immortalise himself as the rock god people always believe him capable to be, putting him among the ranks at the young age of twenty-six.</p><p>It\u2019s crazy, he left the UK when he was fourteen and then four years later the band was signed, and they were hitting the big time when he was twenty.</p><p>Such a fast rise. And I wonder, if he can achieve what he has in only eight years in the music industry, just imagine what he\u2019ll be able to do in twenty.</p><p>But all of this aside, ignoring all the gloss and the money, all I see when I look at pictures of him is my old best friend, Jake Wethers. The guy I used to have movie and pizza night with. The guy who helped me bury Fudge, my pet rabbit when he died. And sat with me holding my hand all day while I cried over his loss.</p><p>It\u2019s just been so long and we\u2019ve been apart so long, our lives taking such different paths, what will we even have to say to each other? Anything at all? Will he even remember me?</p><p>My phone starts to ring, breaking my reverie. I pull my earphones out and answer the phone.</p><p>\u201cTrudy Bennett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>My heart melts a little. It\u2019s my very lovely, very gorgeous blonde haired, blued-eyed, smart boyfriend, Will. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019ve been with Will for two years. I first met him at university, but nothing ever happened between us, then after I graduated I didn\u2019t see him again until two years ago when I bumped into him on a night out with Simone. We\u2019ve been together ever since.</p><p>\u201cHey yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still on for dinner tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe sure are,\u201d I smile.</p> <p>\u201cWonderful, so I\u2019ll pick you up for your place at seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you then.\u201d</p><p>I hang the phone up with Will and stare at my screen. I open Google and search for pictures of Jake.</p><p>I click on one enlarging it on my screen. He\u2019s bare-chested, and he looks so incredibly beautiful.</p><p>Jake is lean but muscular, defined, with lovely slim hips. His hair is black, shaved close around the sides, longer on the top, he wears it high and messy. His hair-style, on anyone else would probably look silly, but not him. On him it looks perfect. And in contrast to his black hair, his eyes are blue. Startlingly so, just like the colour of the ocean.</p> <p>He\u2019s always had this cute little smattering of freckles over his nose ever since I can remember, but now, they somehow now make his gorgeous bad boy edge even more apparent.</p><p>Jake is also covered in tattoos. He\u2019s almost as famous for his tattoos as he is his music and bad boy antics.</p><p>Jake has a full tattoo sleeve on his right arm. Tattoos on his left forearm and T M S in script on its inner, but his most distinctive tattoo, well for me anyway, is the one on his chest. It spans right across, sitting just below his collar bone, which says ...</p><p>I wear my scars, they don\u2019t wear me</p><p>Sometimes I wonder just how true that statement is.</p><p>Looking back, I don\u2019t know at exactly what point I knew I was in love with Jake. I guess I just always was.</p> <p>My mum used to say when we were toddlers I did follow him around like a puppy dog.</p><p>Jake and I were best friends \u2013 as close as you could get. And I know it was all he would have, and ever did see me as. He was always way out of my league.</p><p>I guess the sad thing for me, or maybe in hindsight the best thing, was just as I was realising the depth of my feelings for Jake, he was gone.</p><p>One thing I do find amusing is knowing how Jake is with women nowadays, he\u2019s basically a slut, but when he was younger he was never interested in girls.</p><p>Back then, we were all about the music. I guess it was what bound us together. Well that and the other stuff. The bad stuff in Jake\u2019s life.</p><p>Jake was always heavily into music, as was I, thanks to my dad.</p><p>My Dad used to be a guitarist in a small time rock band back in the eighties called The Rifts.</p><p>I was spoon fed music. And my dad fed it to Jake too. I think to my dad, Jake was the son he never had.</p> <p>My life was a little different than other kids, when their parents were teaching them to sing Twinkle, Twinkle, my dad was teaching me the lyrics to (I Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction.</p><p>I was brought up listening to the likes of The Rolling Stones, Dire Straits, The Doors, Johnny Cash, Fleetwood Mac, and the Eagles, to name a few.</p><p>My Mum tried to balance it out, bless her, but my dad lives and breathes music, and he is such a force in my life she never stood a chance. I love my mum of course, but I absolutely adore my dad.</p><p>So because of my differences, and there were plenty of them believe me, I never really fit in with any of the kids at school, neither did Jake.</p><p>We were our own island, and when he left, I was left adrift for a long time.</p><p>My dad taught me how to play the piano, he tried with the guitar but I could never get the hang of it. Jake on the other hand was an absolute natural on the guitar. My dad gave him his own first six-string when he was seven. He always did say Jake was a born musician, so I guess it\u2019s no surprise to him Jake is as successful as he is.</p><p>My dad is really proud of Jake\u2019s career.</p><p>He\u2019s always said I should get in touch with him, but I brushed it off, so there is no way I\u2019m calling dad to tell him I\u2019m seeing Jake tomorrow. He\u2019d probably try and come with me.</p><p>It\u2019s going to be surreal seeing Jake after all this time.</p><p>I click off the picture and open another, a close up of his face. I stare at the picture, my eyes tracing the scar on his chin, the one which stretches along his jawline, it\u2019s not as noticeable as it used to be, maybe he covers it with makeup nowadays.</p><p>I know more about Jake than anyone. I know about a part of his past he\u2019s managed to keep hidden away from the rest of the world.</p><p>Then a thought sweeps my mind. Maybe he won\u2019t want to see me. Maybe he feels like he left behind the life he had here, and that\u2019s why he dropped contact with me.</p><p>Maybe me, home, reminds him of a time he\u2019d rather forget.</p><p>Jake had a pretty rough time growing up, which lead to his dad Paul going to prison when Jake was nine. Susie, Jake\u2019s mum, remarried a few years later to lovely man called Dale. He was an architect brought over from the firm\u2019s office in New York to work on a long term project in Manchester where we lived. Then when Jake was fourteen, Dale was offered a promotion back in their New York office and he took it.</p><p>Six weeks later Jake was gone. And my heart was left broken.</p><p>With a resigned sigh, I click off Google and Jake disappears from my screen.</p><p>I force myself to open my Word document to get the questions compiled for tomorrow before I go to dinner with Will tonight.</p><p>I don\u2019t go to interviews unprepared. Especially if said interview is with my old best friend and one time love of my life.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>I arrive home from work, after somehow managing to compile a list of suitable questions for the interview with Jake tomorrow, drop my handbag on our coffee table, sling my jacket on the arm of the sofa and kick my shoes off.</p><p>Simone is in the kitchen. We share a modest two bedroom converted ground floor flat in Camden, which we rent from Simone\u2019s cousin who is a property developer. Our rent is really reasonable as Marc and Simone are close. We would never have been able to afford it otherwise.</p><p>I wander in to the sound of the kettle boiling.</p><p>\u201cWant one?\u201d she asks holding up the coffee jar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love one, thanks.\u201d</p><p>I get the biscuits out of the cupboard, then Simone hands me my coffee, and with the biscuits under my arm, I follow her back through into our small living room.</p><p>I sit next to her on the sofa, putting the pack of biscuits between us.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s your day been?\u201d I ask, as I munch on a biscuit.</p><p>This is my opener to telling her about Jake.</p><p>\u2018How\u2019s your day been Simone? ... Mine you ask? Well, tomorrow morning I\u2019m going to be interviewing Jake Wethers.\u2019 \u2013 cue lots of screaming from Simone and maybe a little from me.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she beams, tucking her blonde hair behind her ear. \u201cIn fact, it was actually great.\u201d She turns to face me, tucking her legs under her bum. \u201cWe landed Penners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did! And then afterwards Daniel took me into his office to tell me they\u2019re promoting me to senior Ad Exec!\u201d</p><p>\u201cArgghhh!\u201d I scream.</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d she screams back.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s brilliant, Simone! I\u2019m so pleased for you! And mega proud!\u201d I give her a one armed hug, trying not to spill my coffee on her.</p><p>Simone works for an Advertising agency. She\u2019s been working on landing Penners for ages, so I know how big a deal this is for her. She loves her job, and as proven, is very good at it.</p><p>She\u2019s also stunningly gorgeous and has no clue as to the actual effect she has on men. With her lovely swishy, long blonde hair, saucer blue eyes and skin the colour of cream.</p><p>She is sweet, kind-hearted and \u00fcber wonderful, and I just love her to bits.</p><p>\u201cWe should celebrate tonight,\u201d I enthuse, getting more and more on board with the idea as I talk about it. \u201cI was supposed to be having dinner with Will, but I\u2019ll cancel. We can get dressed up, have cocktails at Mandarin\u2019s ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She waves me off. \u201cYou can\u2019t cancel on Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can, and I will.\u201d I start to laugh at my own joke.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dork.\u201d She nudges my leg with her foot, chuckling.</p><p>\u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t have me any other way,\u201d I grin.</p><p>\u201cThat I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, he\u2019ll understand, Will\u2019s a very understanding man.\u201d I take another bite of my biscuit and drop crumbs all over my T-shirt. I brush them off. \u201cTonight isn\u2019t a big deal, we were only having dinner. Seriously, you and I will go out and celebrate \u2013 I\u2019ll call Will now.\u201d</p><p>Honestly, I could do with the distraction of alcohol tonight because my nerves are fraught over the whole Jake interview thing, and Simone is my very best drinking partner.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m definitely sure.\u201d I grin.</p><p>\u201cThen you are definitely on.\u201d</p><p>Putting my coffee down, I lean over and retrieve my phone from my bag.</p><p>I have a text waiting from Vicky:</p><p>Good luck tomorrow, darling girl. Come straight to my office when you\u2019re done with Jake, I want ALL the details ;)</p><p>A winky, smiley face. Christ, she\u2019s making it sound like a bloody date.</p><p>A white hot thrill shoots through me at the very thought.</p><p>Jesus, Tru, sort yourself out.</p><p>A: Jake is way out of your league, and always was.</p><p>B: It actually is just an interview.</p><p>And C: You have a very lovely boyfriend by the name of Will. The one who you\u2019re about to cancel on.</p><p>I lean back on the sofa and speed dial Will\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cHey baby,\u201d he coos down the phone. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine ... I was just wondering, would you be majorly pissed if I cancelled tonight? It\u2019s just that Simone found out today she landed that big client she\u2019s been working on for months and also that they are promoting her to Ad Exec! So I thought I should take her out to celebrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t mind. Go out, enjoy yourself. And tell Simone congratulations from me. Rain check for tomorrow night, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d</p><p>I hang up, tossing my phone on the table.</p><p>\u201cGet your best on,\u201d I say, grinning across at Simone. \u201cBecause tonight, you and I are celebrating.\u201d</p><p>I take a quick shower, washing my hair. I blow dry it, and run my straighteners over, smoothing it out.</p><p>My hair is dark, thick, naturally curly ... basically unruly. I wear it long to try and drag the curl down. I inherited my wild hair from my mum. She\u2019s Puerto-Rican. My dad is English.</p><p>And no, before you ask, I don\u2019t look anything like J-Lo. I wish. Well maybe except for my ass, it\u2019s about as big as hers.</p><p>My mum and dad met while he was touring America with The Rifts. My mum was in her first year of university. She\u2019d moved to San Francisco from Puerto Rico to go to university. It was a big thing for her and her family; she was the first to ever go to university.</p><p>My dad was doing a gig at her university, and it was love at first sight. They spent the four days that my dad was in San Francisco together.</p><p>After my dad left to carry on with the tour they kept in touch. Then six weeks later my mum found out she was pregnant with me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was only eighteen at the time, my dad twenty-three, with their whole future in front of them.</p><p>Dad went back to San Francisco and they had a choice to make.</p><p>They said getting rid of me was never an option for either of them, so one of them had to give something up.</p><p>It was either my dad\u2019s music or my mum\u2019s university degree.</p> <p>Mum gave her degree up.</p><p>She told my dad that being a mother was now the only important thing to her, as she\u2019d lost her own mama when she was very young.</p><p>She broke the news to her dad, and he went ballistic. He gave her an ultimatum. It was either me and my dad, or her family back home.</p><p>She chose us.</p><p>He disowned her. Her whole family cut her off.</p> <p>So she left San Francisco and her dream behind and went on tour with my dad and the band to follow his.</p><p>They tried to make it work on the road, but a baby on tour is just not possible, so eventually my dad made the decision to leave the band. They moved back to the England, to Manchester where my dad is from and got married.</p><p>For the first two years of my life we all lived with my Gran and Granddad at their house, until mum and dad could afford their own house.</p><p>And that was when I moved next door to Jake.</p><p>Sometimes I feel like I ruined my dad\u2019s chances of hitting the big time, and took away my mum\u2019s chance of a career. Neither of them have ever made me feel that way, not once, and I know they would be angry if I even think it. But mostly I feel that way about my dad. I just know how much he loves music and how hard it must have been for him to give it up.</p><p>I sweep some mascara over my lashes, dust on my gold eye-shadow, it goes best with my brown eyes, and put some pale pink gloss onto my lips. Then I decide on my black maxi dress. I slip my feet into my silver kitten heels, and pick up my chainmail handbag, putting my money and lip gloss in it.</p> <p>I give myself one last look in the mirror. Not bad, Tru. Not perfect, but not bad.</p><p>I meet Simone out in the hall.</p><p>\u201cYou look gorgeous,\u201d I say. She\u2019s wearing a short, light blue puff ball dress.</p><p>She wiggles her hips. \u201cRight back at ya, sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you call me a dork.\u201d I shake my head, laughing at her. \u201cYou got your keys?\u201d</p><p>She dangles them in the air.</p><p>\u201cRight lets go then.\u201d</p><p>Simone locks up and we walk out into the night air, heading for our local haunt, and most awesome cocktail bar, Mandarin\u2019s.</p> <p>It\u2019s surprisingly packed for a Thursday night. We get a pitcher of margarita\u2019s and grab a free table.</p><p>I pour drinks into both our glasses.</p><p>Lifting mine, I say, \u201cTo my gorgeous and very smart friend, may you run the company one day.\u201d</p><p>Giggling, she chinks my glass.</p><p>I take a sip of my margarita. The alcohol runs down my throat, just the soother I needed.</p><p>\u201cSo how are things at the magazine?\u201d Simone asks.</p><p>I snort out a laugh.</p><p>Okay, here goes ...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m um ... interviewing Jake Wethers tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opens in surprise, forming an \u2018O\u2019.</p><p>\u201cYep. Exactly.\u201d I nod.</p><p>Then she screams, attracting us quite a few stares.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she says embarrassed.</p><p>I\u2019m already laughing at her.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she says calming down, fanning her face, \u201cAny particular reason you\u2019re only just telling me this now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour promotion. We\u2019re celebrating that tonight. I didn\u2019t want talk of Jake overrunning it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d She gives me a stupid look. \u201cI\u2019d rather be overrun by Jake Wethers than my promotion any day.\u201d She flashes her eyes at me.</p><p>I roll mine.</p><p>\u201cSo how did the interview come about? I\u2019m guessing you didn\u2019t set it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVicky did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow in the hell did she manage to land an interview with Jake? Did she use your name to get it?\u201d</p><p>Her words flitter through my mind.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t tell me how, but no, I don\u2019t think so. Using my name wouldn\u2019t have gotten her an interview with Jake anyway.\u201d</p><p>Simone pulls the face she always pulls whenever the subject of Jake comes up and I imply he has no care for me nowadays.</p><p>Not that I talk about him regularly or anything.</p><p>\u201cI bet he\u2019s gonna be so made up to see you. Does he know it\u2019ll be you doing the interview?\u201d</p><p>Does he?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I shrug. \u201cHis people will have my name, but I highly doubt he\u2019ll be bothered about who\u2019s interviewing him ... and he won\u2019t be made up, Simone, we haven\u2019t seen each other for twelve years. He\u2019ll have forgotten all about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure he will,\u201d she says taking another drink of her cocktail. \u201cBecause you always forget your first love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t his first love!\u201d I exclaim.</p><p>\u201cYou were the beautiful girl next door,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cOf course you were his first love.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, despairingly at her.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she says, smiling, topping my drink up, then her own. \u201cLooks like we\u2019re celebrating two things tonight after all.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Oh God. What was I thinking getting drunk last night? Not my smartest plan. Not that I generally have many.</p><p>I was just so nervous at the thought of seeing Jake today. And the more I talked with Simone about it, the more I needed to drink.</p><p>When she pointed out that Jake probably won\u2019t be expecting me if rock stars aren\u2019t informed of who is interviewing them, and then when I walk in there it will be really uncomfortable and awkward ... well, I kept on drinking more and more to dull the panic.</p><p>We practically drank Mandarin\u2019s dry. Sang Journey (Don\u2019t Stop Believing) on karaoke like we were auditioning for a part in Glee and then rolled home at 2am.</p><p>I\u2019ve had six hours sleep; I\u2019m seriously hung over and am currently travelling in on the Tube, feeling like I\u2019m going to puke any second now.</p><p>One-part hangover ... two-part nerves.</p><p>When I finally get off the Tube at Hyde Park Corner, I grab a latte from Starbucks and guzzle it down, praying for it to clear my fuzzy head, as I make my way on foot to The Dorchester, where Jake is staying.</p><p>The closer I get to the hotel, the more my nerves increase in intensity. My stomach keeps clenching in panic.</p><p>No, stop it, Tru. You are a serious journalist and it\u2019s just an interview. You\u2019ve done loads of them. It doesn\u2019t matter who he is, or that you used to love him.</p><p>Still do.</p><p>No I don\u2019t.</p><p>Great, now I\u2019m arguing with myself.</p><p>My phone beeps a text in my bag. It\u2019s from Simone; she\u2019d already left for work this morning before I\u2019d even rolled out of bed. I have no clue how she\u2019d managed it.</p><p>I open the text up:</p><p>Breathe. It\u2019ll be fine. You\u2019ll be talking stories from when you were kids before you know it :) Call me when you\u2019re done. Love you x</p><p>I drop my phone back in my bag, glancing up I see I\u2019ve reached The Dorchester. I drop my empty cup in the nearest bin, take my thin jacket off, and shove it into my oversized bag.</p><p>I\u2019m wearing my black skater skirt, loose fitting grey T-shirt belted at the waist, and my favourite high-heeled, grey suede ankle boots. Not too flashy, not too casual, and I feel comfortable in them. They\u2019re me. And right now I just need to feel comfortable.</p><p>I stare up at the towering hotel.</p><p>Okay, I can do this.</p><p>I take a deep breath in and walk toward the door.</p><p>The concierge opens it for me, and I find myself in the plush foyer.</p><p>I instantly feel out of place. Maybe I should have dressed a little more conservatively.</p><p>But this is how I always dress for work, and when I interview celebrities, but then I\u2019ve never interviewed any one as famous as Jake, or none that I used to play kiss chase with when I five either.</p><p>Oh God. I am so totally shitting myself. And so totally out of my depth here.</p><p>I run my hands nervously down my skirt.</p><p>No, I can do this.</p><p>I lift my head high and walk toward to the reception desk.</p><p>The woman on the reception is very attractive, in that groomed kind of way I\u2019ll never be able to achieve.</p><p>She looks up at me.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say trying to exude confidence I am not feeling. \u201cMy name is Trudy Bennett, I\u2019m here to see Jake Wethers.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. It\u2019s not real. \u201cOf course you are. And I imagine he\u2019s expecting you too.\u201d</p><p>Ahh. Right okay. She\u2019s being a bitch. She thinks I\u2019m a groupie.</p><p>I reach into my bag and pull out my journalist I.D. badge and slap in on the counter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a journalist. I work for Etiquette magazine and I\u2019m here to do an interview with Jake Wethers.\u201d</p><p>She glances at me again, eyes narrowed, then picks the phone up and dials a number.</p><p>\u201cGood Morning. There\u2019s a Trudy Bennett in reception to see Mr. Wethers ... right ... yes, of course.\u201d</p><p>She hangs the phone up.</p><p>\u201cPlease take the lift up to the roof suites, one of Mr. Wethers staff will meet you up there.\u201d</p><p>I pick my badge up and walk away without thanking her. It kills my inbred manners to do so, but she was mean to me.</p><p>I just don\u2019t understand snotty bitches like that. Do I look like a groupie?</p><p>God, I hope not. I stop and glance at myself in the mirror on the way to the lifts.</p><p>My hair\u2019s frizzed up a bit with the humid morning air. I try to smooth it down with my hand as I run my eyes down myself in the mirror.</p><p>Well, I don\u2019t think I look like a groupie. I look like an \u00fcber professional journalist, in my ... um ... skater skirt, which is actually quite short \u2013 has it always been this short or has my ass got bigger?</p><p>Oh holy crap. I look exactly like a groupie.</p><p>I don\u2019t remember looking like this in the mirror this morning. Obviously, I still had my \u2018Tru looks awesome in anything\u2019 margarita goggles still on.</p><p>Fan-fucking-tastic. I haven\u2019t seen Jake in twelve years and I\u2019m going to see him, looking like some groupie chick in a desperately short skirt.</p><p>Good thinking, Tru. Get hammered the night before seeing Jake, then dress like you\u2019re here for a party.</p><p>Resigned to my groupie fate, I stand at the lifts and press the button.</p><p>In a few minutes I\u2019m going to be face to face with him. I can\u2019t stop my hands from trembling a little.</p><p>The lift pings open.</p><p>It\u2019s empty, so I wander in and with my still trembling hand, press the button for the top floor to take me up to the Roof Suites.</p><p>I stand there, foot jigging on the spot, fingers knotted together, counting the floors up. My stomach\u2019s popping, the higher the number on the counter gets.</p><p>The lift reaches the top floor, stopping smoothly and the doors part.</p><p>There on the other side, is a scarily huge guy. Closely shaved hair, and at least six and a half feet tall, and about the same wide.</p><p>\u201cMs. Bennett?\u201d he says in the deepest voice I\u2019ve ever heard.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d My voice comes out in a squeak.</p><p>He smiles at me. I relax a little.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dave, the head of Jake\u2019s security team. Please follow me.\u201d</p><p>Jake has a security team?</p><p>Duh! Of course he does.</p><p>I follow closely behind Dave. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any people around. The rooms must be huge as we\u2019ve only passed by one door on this hallway, and we\u2019ve been walking a little while. I wonder if Jake has the full floor hired out for his people to stay in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We reach the door facing us at the end of the hall.

It is so lovely to meet you.\u201d He gives me a warm smile and reaches out his hand to shake mine.</p> <p>My cheeks flush red. Gorgeous and friendly. PA\u2019s are usually not so nice to journalists, or this good looking.</p><p>I take hold of his hand and give my most professional \u2018I\u2019m a serious journalist\u2019 handshake. I just hope he doesn\u2019t notice how badly my hand is shaking.</p><p>He gives me another smile, his eyes crinkling up at the corners.</p><p>Yep, he felt the shake and knows how nervous I am.</p><p>\u201cJake is in the living room waiting for you, please follow me,\u201d he gestures.</p><p>I follow Stuart down the hall, the door magically closing behind me; Dave I\u2019m guessing.</p> <p>Stuart rounds the corner, I follow behind, and then I find myself in a huge living room, and standing across the room from me is Jake.</p><p>My heart lurches out of my chest, jumps across the room and whams straight into him.</p><p>I feel lost.</p><p>My eyes meet his, and I see it ... the instant recognition.</p><p>He remembers me.</p><p>I feel absolute relief amongst my jittery nerves. Like little monkeys are swinging trees across my nerve endings.</p><p>He\u2019s wearing fitted black jeans and a black V-neck T-shirt, and his hair is in its trademark style.</p><p>And he just looks so painstakingly beautiful.</p> <p>Stuart moves aside, and I walk a little further into the room on seriously wobbly legs. I wish I\u2019d worn flats now.</p><p>Jake\u2019s eyes stay trained on mine. I think he looks a little stunned, and I\u2019m not quite sure in this moment if that is a good thing or not.</p><p>\u201cTru?\u201d His voice. It sounds the same, just deeper, manly, and more American than British now of course, but still the same. I\u2019ve heard him talk on the TV, but hearing him, here, now talking to me \u2013 it\u2019s just Jake \u2013 the Jake I knew.</p><p>\u201cTrudy Bennett?\u201d he repeats. \u201cMy Trudy Bennett?\u201d</p><p>His Trudy Bennett?</p><p>My heart goes haywire as it returns safely to my chest. Thank god he can\u2019t hear it.</p><p>He takes a step forward. \u201cShit, it really is you.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYes. It\u2019s really me.\u201d I sound like his echo, but I don\u2019t really know what else to say.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t exactly sure why I was so terrified and nervous about seeing him. I just figured it was because of who he is now, his stature. But looking at him here, now, I know why I was so scared.</p><p>I was afraid that seeing him again after all this time would cause my old feelings to resurface.</p><p>And seeing Jake, looking like this, I just know that I am so completely and totally fucked.</p><p>Because I\u2019m now fourteen year old Trudy all over again.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Jake exclaims, his lips shaping into a heart-breaking smile as he takes another step closer to me. \u201cWhen Stuart said the name of the interviewer was Trudy Bennett, I just thought \u2013 there can\u2019t be that many Trudy Bennett\u2019s here in the UK can there? \u2013 I mean there probably is but \u2013\u201d He laughs. Surprising to me, he sounds a little nervous.</p><p>\u201cBut then I just thought it would be too much of a coincidence for it to be you ... and shit ... here you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere I am.\u201d Still echoing, sounding like some lame fucking parrot.</p><p>He comes over to me. Each stride he takes closer, my heart whams against my ribcage.</p><p>Then he stops in front of me, only inches away.</p><p>Holy crap, he\u2019s even more beautiful close up. And he\u2019s so much taller now than I remember, but then he was fourteen the last time I saw him in the flesh. He looks even better than he does on TV.</p><p>Wow, he really has grown up.</p><p>He\u2019s smells like of a mixture of cigarettes, aftershave, and mint. It\u2019s a surprisingly alluring smell, and it\u2019s doing all kinds of funny things to me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been what \u2013 eleven years?\u201d he says, his voice quieter now.</p><p>\u201cTwelve.\u201d I swallow.</p><p>\u201cTwelve. Christ, yeah, right.\u201d He runs his hand through his hair. \u201cYou look different ... but the same \u2013 you know,\u201d he shrugs.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I smile. \u201cYou look different too.\u201d I gesture to the tattoos on his arms.</p><p>He grins down at them, then back at me.</p><p>\u201cBut still the same.\u201d I point my finger to the freckles on his nose.</p><p>Surprised by how much my fingers are itching to touch him, I draw my hand back.</p><p>He rubs his hand over his nose. \u201cYeah, no getting rid of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always liked them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you liked the Care Bears, Tru.\u201d</p><p>I flush. I can\u2019t believe he remembers that.</p><p>It\u2019s crazy that he, Jake Wethers, rock god extraordinaire, remembers that I liked the Care Bears when I was little.</p><p>\u201cYou remember that, huh?\u201d I murmur, cheeks flaming.</p><p>\u201cI remember a lot,\u201d he grins, devilishly. \u201cCome on let\u2019s sit down.\u201d</p><p>He grabs hold of my hand. A jolt of electricity fires up my arm, searing into me. His hand is so rough, his fingers calloused. Must come from his years of playing the guitar.</p><p>Jake leads me over to the plush sofa and sits down, letting go of my hand. My hand instantly feels cold.</p><p>I clutch hold of my bag and sit down beside him.</p><p>He turns his body toward me, resting his foot up onto his thigh. It\u2019s only then I realise his feet are bare.</p><p>Seriously, what is it about men in jeans and bare feet which is so totally hot?</p><p>I take my bag off my shoulder and put it to the floor.</p><p>\u201cDo you want something to drink?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I shift my legs toward him, turning my body slightly to face him. His eyes are already on my face.</p><p>I flush under his stare. \u201cWater would be great, thanks.\u201d</p><p>I could actually do with a neat vodka right now to calm my nerves, my hangover suddenly disappearing. But it\u2019s 10am, and Jake is a recovering alcoholic.</p><p>\u201cWater? You sure you don\u2019t want orange juice or something?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cWater\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuart!\u201d Jake yells, making me jump a little.</p><p>Stuart appears a few seconds later through a door to the right of us.</p><p>Was he standing by the door waiting or something? Actually it\u2019s only now I realise I didn\u2019t even see him leaving before. The guy\u2019s pretty stealthy.</p><p>\u201cCan you get Tru a glass of water and I\u2019ll have an orange juice, please,\u201d Jake says to him.</p><p>Tru.</p><p>I love how his voice sounds when he says my name. It\u2019s giving me the warm and fuzzies.</p><p>Stuart nods, smiling at me, then disappears off again.</p><p>I can see Jake\u2019s leg jigging in my eye line. I have the urge to reach over and put my hand on his leg settling him, but I don\u2019t, obviously.</p><p>\u201cSo this is a little crazy, huh?\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>\u201cHmm. A little.\u201d I press my lips together in a small smile.</p><p>Actually, I was thinking more like ... surreal, off the charts.</p><p>A silence falls between us.</p><p>Wow, twelve years apart and I\u2019m just full of conversation, aren\u2019t I?</p><p>It\u2019s weird but I just can\u2019t seem to find a thing to say to him, and I had all yesterday to prepare. I\u2019ve just thrust myself upon him and he\u2019s doing just fine in the talking department.</p><p>But then he was better with people than I was. Hence his success, I guess. Well that and his ability to sing, and of course his looks. His gorgeous, lovely face, and his toned, tight body ...</p><p>\u201cSo how have you been?\u201d he asks me.</p><p>\u201cGood. Great. I\u2019m a music journalist now, obviously...\u201d I trail off.</p><p>\u201cYou always were a good writer,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI was?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t even know he thought that.</p><p>\u201cYeah, those stories you used to make up when we were little, and then you used to make me sit and listen while you read them back to me,\u201d he chuckles, eyes shining with the memory.</p><p>I feel my face go bright red. \u201cOh God,\u201d I groan, embarrassed. \u201cI was so lame.\u201d</p><p>He laughs again, louder this time. \u201cYou were five, Tru. I think we can forgive the lame.\u201d He drags his fingers through his hair. \u201cAnd of course you always loved music so it makes sense the two went together,\u201d he adds.</p><p>My heart suddenly feels all warm and squishy. He remembers so much more than I thought he would.</p><p>\u201cYou still play the piano?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cNo. I stopped\u2013\u201d</p><p>I stopped playing after you left.</p><p>\u201cI just, um, haven\u2019t played in a long time. I fell out of it, you know. Well obviously you don\u2019t know.\u201d I gesture to the guitar propped up against the far wall.</p><p>He smiles. Stuart reappears with our drinks.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say as Stuart hands me my glass of water.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d Stuart asks Jake.</p><p>Jake looks at me. I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re good thanks.\u201d</p><p>Stuart closes the door when he leaves. Leaving Jake and me alone again.</p><p>I sneak a look at him as he has a drink of his juice. It\u2019s so weird, he\u2019s Jake but not Jake.</p><p>And I don\u2019t know why, but I feel so completely uncomfortable and so completely at home in his presence. It\u2019s one of the most confusing feelings I\u2019ve ever had.</p><p>I take a sip of my water. It\u2019s ice cold and welcomingly refreshing.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019d ask how you\u2019re doing but ...\u201d I gesture around at the plush hotel room, as I put my glass down on the table in front of us.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He laughs. It sounds a little forced. He rubs his hand over the scar on his chin, I notice. \u201cI\u2019m great,\u201d he shrugs, smiling and leans forward, putting his juice on the table. I watch the muscles in his arm stretch and tense with his movement.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t sit back, he stays sitting forward, arms resting on his thighs, looking straight ahead.</p><p>He seems a little uncomfortable now and I instantly regret my words.</p><p>How stupid could I be?</p><p>He\u2019s not long out of rehab. His best friend died a little over a year ago. Of course he\u2019s not okay. I don\u2019t think all the money and nice hotel rooms in the world could make that okay.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t have been more insensitive if I\u2019d tried. I bet he thinks I\u2019m a complete idiot now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve followed your music career,\u201d I say in a bright, but too loud voice, just for want of a better thing to say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou have?\u201d He turns his head looking at me surprised.</p><p>\u201cOf course I have,\u201d I smile. \u201cMusic is my job.\u201d His face falls and instantly I know I\u2019ve done it again. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the only reason,\u201d I hastily add. \u201cI wanted to see how you were doing. And you\u2019ve just achieved so much. I was really proud watching you on TV and reading the articles about your music, and when you set up your own label \u2013 I was like, \u2018Wow\u2019 ... and I\u2019ve bought all your albums, of course. And they\u2019re really brilliant.\u201d I\u2019m babbling. Someone stop me, please.</p><p>He\u2019s staring at me again, but there\u2019s something different in his eyes this time.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you get in touch with me, Tru?\u201d</p> <p>His question throws me. I stare at him confused.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t I get in touch with him? He was the one who stopped calling me. Stopped writing. Ignored my letters.</p><p>And I didn\u2019t know where he was until he became famous, and then it\u2019s not like I could get anywhere near him even if I\u2019d wanted to.</p><p>I mean of course I wanted to but, I just couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d My mouth\u2019s gone dry. \u201cYou\u2019re not exactly easy to get in touch with \u2013 Mr Famous Rock Star.\u201d I try to come off as light-hearted, but even I can hear the edge to my voice.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s me. One of the most accessible, inaccessible people on the planet.\u201d His stare is hard on me.</p><p>Have I pissed him off or something?</p><p>And now I just feel totally uncomfortable, because if anyone should be pissed off it\u2019s me. He stopped contact with me.</p><p>I feel a sudden rush of unexplained anger toward him and have the urge to yell at him. I want to ask why he never got in touch with me. He could have found me so easily.</p><p>He was the one that stopped the contact, not me, so he should have been the one to get in touch.</p><p>I want to know why he just disappeared off the face of the planet, and didn\u2019t rock back up until he was sitting in my TV.</p> <p>But I don\u2019t ask any of those things. Fear is keeping my mouth shut. I have half-an-hour max with him and the last thing I want to do is waste it arguing about things that happened twelve years ago, or fuck this interview up \u2013 it\u2019s way too important to Vicky, and the magazine as a whole.</p><p>He pulls a pack of cigarettes from his jean pocket and gets one out. He puts it between his lips, holding a lighter up, he pauses.</p><p>\u201cDo you smoke?\u201d he asks, cigarette still perched between his lips.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he replies.</p><p>Hypocrite, I think.</p><p>\u201cYou mind if I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>He lights his cigarette, dropping the pack and lighter onto the table and takes a long drag.</p><p>I watch the smoke trickle out of his mouth and billow up into the air.</p><p>He really does have nice lips.</p><p>My phone starts to sing a text in my bag. Shit, I forgot to turn it off. It\u2019s unprofessional of me to have it on in an interview.</p><p>Jake\u2019s eyes follow mine down to my bag.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I mumble. I get my phone, silencing it. \u201cIt might be my boss.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not. It\u2019s Will asking how my day is going and that he misses me, and is looking forward to seeing me tonight. He really is sweet.</p><p>\u201cAdele?\u201d Jake grins, inferring to the tune just playing on my phone.</p><p>\u201cI like her,\u201d I respond defensively.</p><p>\u201cOh, me too.\u201d He nods. \u201cShe\u2019s a nice girl. I just figured from what I remember of you, I\u2019d have been hearing the Stones playing on your phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well I\u2019ve changed a lot since you knew me.\u201d That actually came out a lot sharper than I meant.</p><p>Avoiding his eyes, I turn my phone off, drop it in my bag and, pull out my notebook and pen, ready to get this interview started.</p><p>I have got my Dictaphone with me. But right now, I need something to concentrate on, something to do with my hands and writing seems like as good as anything, and my questions are all in here anyway.</p><p>When I look up, Jake\u2019s eyes are on my notepad. They lift to meet with mine. For a moment, I think I see disappointment there.</p><p>\u201cSo, I should get started with the interview \u2013 I\u2019m sure you\u2019re really busy and I don\u2019t want to keep you for longer than necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not keeping me.\u201d His tone is dry. He takes a long, drag of his cigarette. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not busy today. My schedule is clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. You haven\u2019t got any other interviews after mine?\u201d</p><p>A smile flickers over his face. \u201cWell I did have ... consider them cancelled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Don\u2019t do that on my account.\u201d My voice shoots out.</p><p>I know how hard it must have been for those journalists to get this interview with him. It seems to have cost Vicky dearly from the reaction I got yesterday when I probed her about it. But I do like the fact he would do that for me.</p><p>I like it a lot.</p><p>His face darkens, prompting me to add, \u201cI don\u2019t mean I\u2019m not happy to see you, of course I am, and would love to talk old times with you, but I don\u2019t want others to miss out on a great opportunity because of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA great opportunity?\u201d he smirks.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cOh, you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook Tru.\u201d He turns his body toward me. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you for twelve years. The last thing I want to do right now is talk business with you, or anyone else for that matter. I want to know all about you \u2013 what you\u2019ve been doing since I last saw you.\u201d He looks at me curiously. His blue eyes piercing intrusively into mine.</p><p>A shiver runs through me.</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d I shrug, looking down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done a lot more than \u2018not much\u2019.\u201d His tone is surprisingly firm.</p><p>He seems so much more forceful than he used to be. But then of course, he was teenager back then. He\u2019s a man now.</p><p>A very rich and very famous man.</p><p>And I instantly feel intimidated in a whole other way.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do after you left Manchester?\u201d I shrug, looking up at him. \u201cI lived my life, I finished school.\u201d My voice suddenly sounds a little bitter, it surprises even me.</p><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d His face stays impassive, eyes trained on me.</p><p>\u201cSchool? It was school. A little lonely after you left, but I got through it.\u201d</p><p>That was a dig meant to hurt him. But if it does, then it doesn\u2019t show on his face.</p><p>His just continues to stare impassively at me, and I\u2019m starting to squirm under his heavy gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou still see anyone from school?\u201d</p><p>I tuck my hair behind my ear. \u201cNo, I\u2019m friends with a couple of people on Facebook but that\u2019s about it. What about you?\u201d I ask.</p><p>I\u2019ve always wondered if he kept in touch with anyone else; not that he had many other friends aside from me, after he binned me off that was.</p><p>He laughs. \u201cNo. Then what did you do after school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoved here to go to uni. I got my degree in journalism. Then I landed a job at Etiquette, the magazine I work for, and I\u2019ve worked there ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d Another drag of his cigarette. \u201cYou\u2019re not married.\u201d His words come out with the smoke, and I see his eyes flicker to my left hand.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d He takes another drag, then leans over and stubs his cigarette out in the waiting ashtray.</p><p>My heart halts. I don\u2019t know why but I have the sudden urge to not want to tell him about Will.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say slowly.</p><p>\u201cLive together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d This seems a little personal and a lot grilling. Why is he so interested? \u201cI live with my flat mate Simone in Camden.\u201d</p><p>His face stays impassive. \u201cHow long have you been with the boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Will, and we\u2019ve been together for two years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what does Will do for a living?\u201d</p><p>Why is he suddenly so interested in Will?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an investment banker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart guy.\u201d I can\u2019t actually tell if he\u2019s being sarcastic or not.</p><p>\u201cHe is.\u201d I nod. \u201cHe\u2019s very smart \u2013 top of his class at uni and he\u2019s climbing the ladder at work very quickly.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why but I suddenly feel the urge to needle him with Will and how great he is.</p><p>Seeing as though Jake is a rich mega star, I don\u2019t want to seem so left behind I guess, even though all I can sell myself with, is Will.</p><p>Jake gets another cigarette out of his pack and lights it up.</p><p>Wow, he smokes a lot.</p><p>I curl my fingers around the edge of my notebook.</p><p>The atmosphere has shifted, and I\u2019m not entirely sure where to. And I suddenly just want to get out of here. I want to get this interview done, so I can leave.</p><p>He\u2019s not the Jake I remember. Or the Jake from the papers. I\u2018m not actually sure who this Jake is that\u2019s sitting before me.</p><p>I unclip my pen from my notebook, and open it up to the page where my prepared questions are.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been really nice catching up with you, Jake, but I really should get to the interview - especially if I want to keep my job.\u201d I try to keep my tone professional and add a smile for good measure.</p><p>Not that Vicky would ever fire me, well I hope she wouldn\u2019t, but he doesn\u2019t need to know that.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t get fired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound pretty confident of that.\u201d I force a little laugh out.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>He takes another long drag of his cigarette, eyes fixed on mine.</p><p>Looking away, I shift nervously in my seat.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou seem a little uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>Still as direct as ever. That obviously hasn\u2019t changed obviously.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m not uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>Yes, I am. I\u2019m a little intimidated by you and confused by your questions, and flustered and ready to leave to be honest.</p><p>\u201cI just need to\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo your job.\u201d He finishes for me. \u201cOkay, go ahead, ask me anything. I\u2019m all yours Tru, for the next thirty minutes.\u201d He glances at his expensive watch, then leans back against the sofa, putting one arm to rest on the back and smiles at me. It\u2019s a smile with something behind it. A cheeky kind of smile.</p><p>And it doesn\u2019t relax me at all. Not one single bit. If anything it makes me even more nervous.</p><p>Putting the end of my pen in my mouth, I glance down at my first question, but now it just seems so lame and I feel embarrassed. I\u2019ve done so many interviews in my time, but I can honestly say this is my hardest to date. Maybe it\u2019s because I know ... knew him so well.</p><p>I know his eyes are still on me, I can feel them, and a heat is fast rising up my neck.</p><p>I get my water from the table, have a drink of it, put it down and without looking at him, say, \u201cIt\u2019s been said in the past that you\u2019re a perfectionist when it comes to your work \u2013 your music, and because of that you can be ... at times, difficult to work with. Do you agree with that? Do you consider yourself a perfectionist?\u201d</p><p>The question was actually fourth on my list, but I decide to go straight in with the question that may possibly piss him off first. I\u2019m just in that kind of mood now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I look over at him and I can see the tiniest hint of a smile on his lips. He actually looks impressed. And for a moment, I wonder what he was expecting me to ask him.</p><p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t work with me, Tru, they work for me. And the guys in my band, the ones who matter, don\u2019t seem to have a problem with the way I run things.\u201d</p><p>Wow, arrogant much? And kind of hot.</p><p>Crap.</p> <p>\u201cBut to answer your question,\u201d he continues. \u201cI want my music and my label to be the best it can be. Currently it is, and I intend to keep it that way, so if I have to bust a few balls and have myself labelled as a complete shit to work for, or a \u2018perfectionist\u2019,\u201d he air quotes, \u201cto keep me, my band and my label at the top of its game, then yeah, call me a perfectionist. I\u2019ve been called worse.\u201d He grins.</p><p>And it travels all the way through me. I have to press my knees together to stop my legs from trembling.</p><p>I scribble down the last of his answer quickly, and clear my throat. \u201cThe general feeling and what people are saying, is that \u2018Creed\u2019 is your most chart-friendly album to-date, do you agree with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>Eh?</p> <p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve listened to the album.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s testing me.</p><p>\u201cOf course I have ... and ... yes, I agree with the general consensus. I think that a lot of the songs are holding a softer tone than your previous albums. Especially \u2018Damned\u2019 and \u2018Sooner\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Ha, suck on that!</p><p>\u201cGood. Then then the point of the album is being received.\u201d He smiles, and I feel a little lost.</p> <p>What?</p><p>Okay, recover yourself Tru.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me \u2013 what would you be doing right now if you weren't talking to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be catching up with an old friend.\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d I stumble, caught totally off guard, yet again. \u201cOkay ... it\u2019s been a while since you toured, are you looking forward to getting back on the road and playing live again?\u201d</p><p>He sits forward, closer to me. I have the urge to lean back, but I don\u2019t, instead I cross my legs in front of me, feeling like they could somehow protect me from whatever answer, or quite possibly question, he has ready to throw at me.</p><p>He was always smart when we were kids, and so quick, but this grown-up Jake is like a snake in a stallions clothing.</p> <p>He most certainly does not come across as the womanizing, drinking, drug addicted Jake the press claim him to be. Or even like a man who just got of rehab a little over four weeks ago.</p><p>He seems in control. Or maybe this is just what sober Jake is like.</p><p>His eyes flicker down to my bare legs, quickly travelling up them and back up to my face.</p><p>And there\u2019s the womanizer in him.</p><p>\u201cPlaying live is what I love to do, it\u2019s what I live to do ... and I have a feeling this tour is going to be a very interesting one \u2013 probably my most interesting to date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, and why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m curious now, if anything I thought this tour would be hard for him with Jonny gone. Especially, considering what happened in Japan.</p><p>He runs his hand through his hair. \u201cI\u2019ve just had a recent addition to my team and I know for sure she\u2019ll make things different, interesting ... better.\u201d</p><p>She?</p><p>Maybe he\u2019s got a girlfriend nowadays. But then he did say his team, I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t screw the staff \u2013 actually no he probably does.</p><p>\u201cAnd this new addition, I\u2019m taking it she\u2019s not new a band member?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, lips pressed together.</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s part of the team putting the tour together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI put the tour together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So she\u2019s...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s say she does ... PR.\u201d</p><p>Okay ... I decide to move on from there seeing as though he\u2019s not keen to expand on the mystery woman who\u2019s going to make his tour his most successful to date.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me about your personal favorites on the album and where the inspiration for them came from?\u201d</p><p>Then I see the spark in his eye, and I know I\u2019ve caught him with his music, the one thing he truly loves, and I\u2019m reminded of that boy I loved all those years ago.</p><p>It makes my heart ache a little.</p><p>Forcing myself to focus, not wanting to miss a word he says, I start to write quickly trying to catch up as his enthusiastic words start to spill out.</p><p>And that\u2019s how it is for the next thirty minutes. Question after question, I listen to him come more and more to life as he talks about his music; just like the old Jake I knew in so many ways.</p><p>It makes me miss him, in the oddest way, even though he\u2019s sitting right here before me.</p><p>I keep all the questions music based. I don\u2019t ask any of the questions I had lined up about Jonny Creed\u2019s death, how it affected him or his time in rehab or about his personal life. It just wouldn\u2019t feel in line with the whole vibe of the interview, and I don\u2019t want to spoil the obvious pick-up in his mood, and I\u2019ve got a feeling he wouldn\u2019t answer them anyway.</p><p>To be honest I\u2019m surprised I wasn\u2019t vetted by Stuart on what I could and couldn\u2019t ask Jake when I first arrived. That\u2019s how it usually works with celebrities. Especially ones as high profile as Jake.</p><p>But then I get the distinct impression that Jake doesn\u2019t play by the rule book in anything \u2013 and that any vetting to be done \u2013 he does himself.</p><p>I finish shorthand scribbling down his last answer and then close my note pad and put it back in my bag.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been really good to see you, Tru.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d</p><p>I feel a sudden lump in my throat and I realise, even though half an hour ago I felt like bolting, now, I don\u2019t want to leave him. The thought of not seeing him again is constricting my heart in the weirdest kind of way.</p><p>Crazy, I know.</p><p>I reach down and pick my bag up, and stand. Jake follows suit, standing beside me.</p><p>I\u2019m not really sure what to do now.</p><p>Do I shake his hand, or hug him, or what?</p><p>\u201cDid you bring a coat?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in my bag.\u201d I turn to him. He looks down at me with his crystal clear blue eyes. \u201cThank you again for the interview. It was great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me; I\u2019d do an interview for you anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might hold you to that,\u201d I laugh.</p><p>\u201cDo,\u201d he says. Not a trace of humour in his voice.</p><p>I suddenly feel unsteady. I put my bag strap onto my shoulder, holding my bag to me for support. \u201cThanks again for your time,\u201d I smile and start to walk toward the door, my legs feeling like lead.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re heading back to work now?\u201d Jake asks following behind me.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need a ride? I can get Stuart to drive you.\u201d</p><p>I feel a smart of disappointment. I actually thought he was going to offer to drive me back for a moment there. But then I guess Jake going out in a car is an awful lot of hassle to go to, just to drop off little old me. He\u2019d probably need his full security team with him.</p><p>Not that that I\u2019ve seen many of them around. Just Dave.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, thank you, I\u2019ll walk, it\u2019s not far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>He reaches for the handle to open the door for me, and stops. \u201cDo you have plans tonight ... because I was wondering if you would have dinner with me?\u201d</p><p>My heart stops. Literally, stops.</p><p>Then goes kaboom in my chest.</p><p>I\u2019m supposed to be going out for dinner with Will tonight. Will, my lovely boyfriend. Who I can\u2019t cancel on again.</p><p>Can I?</p><p>If I say no to Jake, I might not get the chance to see him again.</p><p>Yes. No. No. Yes.</p><p>I\u2019m speaking before I even realise I\u2019m doing it.</p><p>\u201cNo I don\u2019t have plans, I\u2019m free. Completely free.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, widely. \u201cGreat. Cool. So we can catch up properly without the threat of an interview hanging over us.\u201d He gives me a small smile, a cheeky glint in his eyes.</p><p>Holy shit. Dinner with Jake.</p><p>My heart is doing somersaults in my chest.</p><p>It\u2019s not a date. It\u2019s not a date. It\u2019s not a date.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d My voice goes a little squeaky. I clear my throat. \u201cSounds like plan.\u201d</p><p>He smiles again, it reaches all the way to his beautiful eyes. \u201cEight o\u2019clock okay?\u201d</p><p>Now would be fine with me. Yesterday, whenever, I\u2019m easy.</p><p>\u201cEight o\u2019clock is great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrite down your address and I\u2019ll come pick you up.\u201d</p><p>I pull my note pad back out from my bag, quickly scribble down my address, tear the page out and hand it to him.</p><p>My fingers touch his in the exchange and my skin hums. I feel my face start to heat up again.</p><p>Jake glances at the paper in his hand, then folds it up and puts it in his back pocket.</p><p>He opens the door for me and stands aside to let me through.</p><p>We walk to the front door in silence, Stuart and Dave are nowhere to be seen.</p><p>When we reach the door, we stop for a moment facing one another.</p><p>I have no idea why, but I just feel sad again saying goodbye to him. Like I\u2019m never going to see him again. Which is stupid because I\u2019m going to see him tonight.</p><p>I\u2019m seeing Jake tonight. A thrill shoots through me.</p><p>He reaches his hand up to my face and tucks my hair behind my ear. I almost swoon, my legs trembling, tummy butterflying.</p><p>Then he leans down and kisses my cheek.</p><p>The feel of his lips on my skin, his hot breath momentarily halts every moving particle of me, paralysing me to the spot, nearly sending me into convulsions.</p><p>As he moves back, he smiles warmly at me. \u201cSo I\u2019ll see you tonight then.\u201d He opens the door for me.</p><p>\u201cYes, tonight. At eight.\u201d Oh God, I sound like a complete idiot.</p><p>I stumble through the door, legs failing on me. I grip hold of my bag like as it\u2019s my life support.</p><p>\u201cBye, Jake,\u201d I say, lingering.</p><p>\u201cBye, Trudy Bennett.\u201d</p><p>I force myself to turn and walk down the hall.</p><p>When I reach the end of the hall, I turn, looking back but the door is already closed.</p><p>I reach the lift and the doors instantly ping open.</p><p>I wobble into the lift, press for ground and fall back against the mirrored wall.</p><p>I\u2019m going out for dinner tonight with Jake.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>It\u2019s going to be okay.</p><p>No it\u2019s so totally not.</p><p>How the hell am I going to explain to Will that I\u2019m cancelling on him for the second night in a row, this time to go out for dinner with Jake Wethers, who I forget to mention I knew very well when I was younger and have just interviewed today, which he also didn\u2019t know as I neglected to tell him that too.</p><p>Okay, deep, calming breaths Tru. It\u2019s not a big deal. Will is cool, he\u2019s understanding. And really there is no issue to have. It\u2019s just two old friends having dinner. One of them just happens to be the world\u2019s biggest rock star.</p><p>Oh crap.</p><p>The concierge opens the door freeing me from The Dorchester and I step onto the busy street. The warm air on my face does little to help me, right now I need a blast of the cool. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Looking at my watch, I see it\u2019s 11:15. Digging my phone out of my bag, I decide to call Will at work and see if he\u2019s free to have lunch with me so I can tell him about tonight.</p><p>\u201cWill Chambers.\u201d</p><p>Oh, I love his work voice. All deep and professional. So cute.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey baby.\u201d He sounds happy to hear from me. He won\u2019t be happy when I tell him I\u2019m cancelling tonight.</p><p>\u201cI was calling to see if you fancied meeting me for lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. What time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever you\u2019re free. I\u2019m already out of the office; I just finished up on an interview.\u201d With Jake Wethers whose album you were listening to the other day.</p><p>\u201cHow does half-an hour sound? I\u2019ll meet you at Callo\u2019s?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrilliant. See you soon.\u201d</p><p>I head straight to Callo\u2019s, which is a little upmarket caf\u00e9. I take a window seat and order a latte.</p><p>Then I ring Vicky.</p><p>\u201cTrudy, my superstar! How did it go with the gorgeous rocker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Great.\u201d The memory of his lips on my cheek flashes through my mind and I feel myself heating up. \u201cI got plenty for the article. I\u2019ve just stopped off to have an early lunch with Will and then I\u2019ll be heading back to write it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he remembers you then?\u201d There\u2019s a teasing tone in her voice.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d I can\u2019t help the smile on my lips. \u201cHe ... um ... well he actually asked me out to dinner tonight to catch up on old times.\u201d</p><p>She actually squeals down the phone. She doesn\u2019t act like my boss at times, or owner of a magazine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going aren\u2019t you? Please tell me you said yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said yes.\u201d</p><p>Another squeal.</p><p>Jeez, has she been drinking or something?</p><p>I look up and see Will coming in through the door.</p><p>\u201cLook I\u2019ll have to go, Will just arrived.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy office when you get back, I want all the gory details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no gory details,\u201d I laugh but keep my voice quieter so Will doesn\u2019t hear in his approach.</p><p>\u201cSure there isn\u2019t. See you soon,\u201d she sings.</p><p>I hang the call up and Will leans down and kisses me on the cheek. On the same spot as where Jake kissed me. I feel this odd territorial feeling and a flash of anger toward Will. Annoyed that he\u2019s just erased Jakes kiss. Which is completely crazy, even by my standards.</p><p>Will sits down across from me and the waiter comes over. Will orders a white coffee, and me another latte.</p><p>\u201cWhat would like to eat?\u201d he asks me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a ham and cheese Panini,\u201d I say to the waiter.</p><p>\u201cBLT on brown for me,\u201d Will says handing him back the menu.</p><p>Will reaches over and takes hold of my hand. I notice how soft his hands are compared to Jake\u2019s rough ones.</p><p>\u201cI missed you last night,\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too,\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cSo how was it? You have fun with Simone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. We got a quite drunk though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you two always,\u201d he smiles. \u201cGreat news about her promotion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d I fidget nervously with my free hand. Taking a deep breath, it\u2019s now or never, I say, \u201cSo, I have some news.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flicker to mine with interest.</p><p>I\u2019m not actually sure where to start first. Maybe just at the beginning.</p><p>\u201cWell, I never told you this, not because it\u2019s a big deal or anything, just because it was never really relevant, and I don\u2019t really tell anyone, but growing up, I lived next door to Jake Wethers.\u201d</p><p>I see confusion which suddenly clicks into understanding in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cJake Wethers ... as in ... The Mighty Storm \u2013 Jake Wethers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one and only.\u201d I give him a tight smile.</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d he says clearly impressed. \u201cWow. Okay. So did you know him in passing or quite well\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was my best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe lost touch when his family moved to America when we were fourteen, and well we recently just got back in touch.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrows. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, today. This morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he says again. His voice is tight now.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s who I was just interviewing. Vicky managed to land an interview with him and she sent me knowing I knew him\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Vicky knows you knew him?\u201d</p><p>Crap.</p><p>Why is he so quick. He\u2019s clearly hurt by it.</p><p>\u201cYes ... I ... um...\u201d I tuck my hair behind my ear. \u201cI told her when I was drunk last Christmas, purely accidental and not a big deal.\u201d</p><p>The waiter appears with our drinks and food, forcing Will to let go of my hand, and giving me a momentary and welcomed reprieve.</p><p>\u201cSo you did the interview this morning \u2013 how was it seeing him after all this time?\u201d he seems a little easier now.</p><p>Good.</p><p>\u201cUm ... it was little surreal, I guess,\u201d I shrug. \u201cI knew him when he was younger. He\u2019s a lot different now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe most certainly is.\u201d Will\u2019s tone is sharp. It surprises me.</p><p>How can he make that statement when he doesn\u2019t even know Jake? I suddenly feel very protective over him.</p><p>\u201cSo, anyway,\u201d I say, mildly, hiding my annoyance. \u201cBecause I was interviewing him we didn\u2019t really get to chat much \u2013 you know, catch up on old times, and well, he asked me to join him for dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>He puts the sandwich down that he\u2019d just picked up.</p><p>\u201cJake Wethers has asked my girlfriend out for dinner.\u201d He suddenly sounds all territorial. Not like Will at all.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a date, silly. It\u2019s just two old friends catching up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and one half of those old friends happens to be my very beautiful girlfriend, and the other, the man-whore of the rock world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill!\u201d I exclaim, shocked. \u201cThat\u2019s a little unfair. You don\u2019t even know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly you do.\u201d</p><p>Hang on. When did this turn into an argument?</p><p>It must be the expression on my face that prompts him to say, \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve just had a crap morning at work, and I was looking forward to seeing you and I guess my green-eyed monster is raising his head a little. You can\u2019t blame me for that \u2013 I mean look at you.\u201d He reaches his hand over, cupping my cheek, sinking his fingers into my hair.</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing to be jealous of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a rich good-looking rock star. I\u2019d have to be a little stupid not to be jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he may be.\u201d I take hold of his hand and kiss his palm. \u201cBut he\u2019s not you. And I love you.\u201d</p><p>That seems to appease him as his face relaxes a little.</p><p>I release his hand, allowing him to pick up his sandwich.</p><p>\u201cHow long is he in town for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few days.\u201d</p><p>That seems to please him further.</p><p>\u201cI guess it will be nice for you to catch up seeing as though you were childhood friends.\u201d</p><p>And I loved him.</p><p>Covering my thoughts with a smile, I omit that thought and say, \u201cSo, as I\u2019ve let you down two nights in a row for my friends now, I\u2019m going to do something special tomorrow night to make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>His brows rise. \u201cI\u2019m intrigued. Go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave it to your imagination, and then tomorrow night you can tell me if I fulfilled it.\u201d I grin at him.</p><p>\u201cYou never fail to make me happy, Trudy, and I can\u2019t see that changing anytime soon, so I\u2019m sure whatever you have planned will live up to my already high standard of you.\u201d</p><p>That is so sweet. And now I feel kind of crap for having no clue what I\u2019m going to do to make it up to him tomorrow night. I\u2019m going to have to come up with something awesome.</p><p>I pick my panini up and take a bite.</p><p>Will walks me back to my office building, giving me a long lingering kiss before leaving me.</p><p>I head through the lobby and take the stairs up. Our office is only on the second floor and the exercise is good for me.</p><p>Going bright red at the whistles from my colleagues, I\u2019m guessing Vicky\u2019s already told them about my interview with Jake. I quickly drop my bag at my desk and head straight to her office.</p><p>She\u2019s deep in concentration reading something on her computer screen when I knock on her open door.</p><p>Her eyes brighten when she sees me and she smiles. \u201cSit down and tell me all about the dirty boy of rock.\u201d</p><p>I frown at her. I know Jakes got a reputation but I don\u2019t like her calling him that.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not so much a boy, Vicky.\u201d</p><p>She raises her perfectly plucked eyebrow. \u201cAnd what does that mean - pray tell?\u201d</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m about to have a chat with one of my girlfriends over cocktails about a guy I just went on a date with. Not about an interview I just did with a celebrity.</p><p>I love that I have this kind of relationship with Vicky.</p><p>I drop myself into her chair across from her desk. \u201cIt means that people seriously underestimate him, Vicky. Yes, he\u2019s singer in a band and he sleeps with lots of women\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he say that?\u201d She looks at me hopefully. Another exclusive in mind.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s just it \u2013 he\u2019s very careful, consummate about what he does say. He seems to ask questions, more than answer them \u2013 don\u2019t worry I got plenty off him \u2013\u201d I add at her worried expression. \u201cIt\u2019s just ...\u201d I pause searching for the right words. The ones that have been evading me ever since I was with him. \u201cI guess he just ... might act the dirty rock boy, out there.\u201d I gesture. \u201cBut I feel that behind the scenes he\u2019s very much the man \u2013 the one who is very much in charge of what happens \u2013 as it\u2019s been said before by the few people who have interviewed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think the women, the partying, it\u2019s all an act?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo. I just think there are two-sides to Jake. The young guy who is very much living the lifestyle he is privilege too, but then there\u2019s the business Jake, the one who runs his label and his band exactly the way he wants to and is very good at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the incident in Japan...\u201d</p><p>\u201cExpected I\u2019d say. His best friend and business partner had just died. Add that on top of the quick rise to fame he had, the money he has \u2013 my guess is it just all got a little too much, and unfortunately his fall was in front of thousands of people.\u201d</p><p>Wow, I\u2019m actually sounding smart here. A first for me.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Vicky leans back in her chair. \u201cSo is he as hot as hell in the flesh as he looks on the TV?\u201d She grins and I know the serious, journalistic aspect of our conversation is gone for now.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s ... a little good-looking, sure.\u201d I downplay.</p><p>\u201cA little good-looking,\u201d she scoffs. \u201cYeah I\u2019m sure that\u2019s all he is.\u201d She purses her lips, like something has just occurred to her. \u201cAnd he\u2019s asked you out for dinner tonight?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was wondering when she was going to mention that. Nothing slips by her. Ever the journalist.</p><p>\u201cHe did. Just a catch up.\u201d I shuffle forward in my seat, getting ready to make an exit.</p><p>\u201cI bet he\u2019s after a thorough catch up with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVicky!\u201d I screech, then cover my mouth with my hand, releasing how loud that was. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you just said that,\u201d I add in a quieter voice, peeling my hand off my mouth.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she laughs. \u201cLook at you\u2013 you have a face and ass to die for. And him? Well, good grief. He\u2019s so delicious I could serve him up on toast and eat him ... and he is well known for his antics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well I\u2019m not, and I do have a boyfriend remember?\u201d I\u2019m a little snippy, but it doesn\u2019t seem to faze her.</p><p>\u201cYes, well we\u2019re all as clean as whistles my darling until men like him come along and dirty us right up.\u201d</p><p>She winks at me, grinning, relieving the tension I\u2019m feeling.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re incurable.\u201d I shake my head humorously at her, rolling my eyes. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t see him that way.\u201d</p> <p>She presses her lips together and narrows her heavy lined eyes at me, suspiciously at me. \u201cYeah, sure you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how did the lovely William take the news of dinner with Jake? You did tell him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d She raises her perfectly, plucked eyebrow. I sometime get the impression Vicky doesn\u2019t like Will.</p><p>\u201cOf course I did.\u201d I sound defensive, I\u2019ve no clue why.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. He was fine with it.\u201d After a while.</p><p>She lets out a little laugh. \u201cHe was fine with you going out to dinner with the most beautiful, prolific womanising rock star in the world?\u201d</p> <p>I press my lips together and let out my breath through my nose. \u201cHe was fine with it, because there\u2019s nothing in it. It\u2019s just two old friends having dinner and nothing more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so my darling.\u201d She brushes her hand through her hair.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d I chipper. \u201cNow if you\u2019re finished grilling me, I\u2019m going to do the work you pay me to do. I\u2019ll type up a draft of the interview and have it ready for you to look over by the end of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be fabulous, thank you, my darling.\u201d She leans back in her chair and brushes her hair off her face.</p><p>Giving her a light smile, I turn and sashay my way out of her office, away from her quizzical stare, because she\u2019s a little closer to the truth on everything then I would care to admit. Jake, my reaction to seeing him after all these years, and Will\u2019s reaction to the news that I\u2019m seeing him tonight. But mostly, how I feel about seeing Jake tonight. And the only word I can think to describe it is ... exhilarated.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Okay. I\u2019m having dinner with Jake.</p><p>Jake Wethers.</p> <p>But he\u2019s still just Jake ... the same Jake I knew.</p><p>No he\u2019s not \u2013 he\u2019s now rock god Jake.</p><p>Oh crap.</p><p>I\u2019ve been ready for the past half an hour and have been pacing around my flat ever since. I\u2019ve had a large glass of wine already and am starting on my second, trying to calm my nerves.</p><p>And Simone\u2019s not here to help either. She was so gutted when I told her Jake was coming to the flat to pick me up. She\u2019s working late on a project for this new client of hers and couldn\u2019t get out of it.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s best she\u2019s not here, I\u2019m freaking out as it is. Simone is a big Mighty Storm fan, so she\u2019d be freaking too, making me worse.</p><p>What on earth am I going to talk to him about tonight?</p><p>I know, I\u2019ve known Jake a long time, but I knew him back then. Not now.</p><p>Now he\u2019s a mega rich superstar. And I\u2019m just a lowly journalist working for a small, up and coming magazine, with enough money to pay the bills and fill the cupboard with enough food and wine to get me through the week.</p><p>He probably earns in an hour what I do in a year.</p><p>I\u2019ve stayed in exactly the same place and Jake has sky rocketed to the stars.</p><p>We live in two very different worlds. I don\u2019t know anything about his life now, except what I\u2019ve read in the papers.</p><p>I wonder if he still likes the same things he did when I knew him?</p><p>Of course he doesn\u2019t. Do I still like the same things I did when I was fourteen? Nope. Well, except for kids cereal. Coco Pops are awesome.</p><p>I\u2019m just wondering once the step back in time has dried up, what on earth will we talk about. We are so worlds apart now. Our childhood aside, what else is there?</p><p>I\u2019m just hoping the childhood stories will somehow stretch us through the night.</p><p>I gulp down another mouthful of wine.</p><p>The doorbell rings. It\u2019s a minute after eight. If nothing else, he\u2019s punctual. And here was me expecting him to be rock star late.</p><p>Putting my glass down, I pick my handbag up, get my keys and wobble on nervous legs to the door.</p><p>When I open it, he\u2019s standing there looking all kinds of gorgeous, wearing dark blue fitted jeans, Converses trainers and a pale blue shirt which is rolled up at the sleeves, top buttons open, his tattoos on show.</p><p>And once again, I suddenly feel totally of out of my depth.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWow. You look great.\u201d</p><p>I flush. \u201cThanks, you too.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m doing a little mini-dance inside.</p><p>This dress was totally worth it \u2013 okay, so I might have popped to my favourite clothes shop, Dixies, after work and bought the dress I\u2019ve been eyeing in the window for the last few weeks. The dress I couldn\u2019t really afford at the moment \u2013 so, thank you Visa.</p><p>It\u2019s not to impress Jake or anything, I mean it\u2019s not like we\u2019re going on a date, but he\u2019s rich and I wanted to look nice. And the dress is so damn cute.</p><p>It\u2019s a black shift dress with silver embellishment all over it, and so totally me. I\u2019ve teamed it with my black heels, and silver clutch bag, and I left my hair down and curly, and kept my make-up minimal, how I always wear it.</p><p>I step through the door, deciding against inviting him in for a drink. He probably lives in a mansion. I don\u2019t want him looking around my tiny flat.</p><p>I lock up and follow him down the path.</p><p>\u201cNice place.\u201d He nods back at the house that hosts my flat.</p><p>\u201cThanks ... wow, is this yours?\u201d I ask as he approaches a silver Aston Martin DBS.</p><p>He grins and unlocks it with the key fob. \u201cLoaner, but I do have one back home.\u201d</p><p>Loaner? I\u2019d be lucky if I\u2019d be able to loan a scooter.</p><p>And once again, I\u2019m reminded of how very different our lives are.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this James Bonds car?\u201d I ask, as I slide into the supple leather seat, putting my seatbelt on.</p><p>\u201cWell, not this specific one, no \u2013 but I have driven his.\u201d</p><p>I slide him a look. \u201cShow off,\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, you have no idea.\u201d He winks at me, leaving my stomach to free-fall off into the next galaxy.</p><p>We pull away, roaring off down my small street, in his very flashy car.</p><p>\u201cSo where are we going?\u201d I ask, still trying to recover myself from his earlier comment.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA surprise?\u201d I turn to look at him.</p><p>He slides me a look, a smile playing on his lips. \u201cYeah a surprise, you remember those \u2013 they usually happen on birthdays, that kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not my birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well I\u2019ve missed twelve of them, so I\u2019ve got quite a few surprises to make up for.\u201d</p><p>I really don\u2019t know what to say to that, so for once, I keep quiet.</p><p>I look out of the window and notice a black Land Rover that is driving pretty close to the back of the car.</p><p>Turning my head, I look over my shoulder at the car. It\u2019s tinted and I can\u2019t see in the window. I hope it\u2019s not paparazzi following him. Don\u2019t they usually drive big smog chuggers like that?</p><p>\u201cThat car\u2019s pretty close behind,\u201d I say, tilting my head back in its direction, trying to alert him.</p><p>Jake\u2019s eyes flick to his rear-view and then back to me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Dave, my security guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Does he go everywhere with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah ... well everywhere, except the bathroom.\u201d He slides his grinning eyes in my direction.</p><p>\u201cWhy is he riding back there and not in the car with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wanted to be alone with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p><p>My nerves have instantly gone haywire. I could really do with another glass of wine.</p><p>Actually, I feel the need to drink every time he looks at me. I have a feeling I\u2019m going to get very drunk tonight.</p><p>I look out of the window again, watching the buildings of London, thinking how surreal this is. Last night I was out getting drunk in Mandarin\u2019s with Simone, ragged nerves over interviewing Jake, wondering if he would remember me, and now I\u2019m here in his fancy James Bond car, and he\u2019s driving me to my surprise night out.</p><p>Jake Wethers, my old best friend, one-time love of my life, biggest rock star and most sought after man in the world, and he is sitting inches away from me. I could reach my hand out and touch him.</p><p>I won\u2019t though, cause that would be pretty weird.</p><p>Actually, things don\u2019t get much weirder than this.</p><p>We\u2019re in Convent Garden when Jake pulls the car up and parks it on the main road just outside a Pizza Hut. His security guy pulls up behind.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you can park here,\u201d I say looking around at the no parking signs</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, come on.\u201d He climbs out of the car. I guess when you\u2019re him you can do whatever you want.</p><p>I climb out of the car and notice there\u2019s a guy standing outside the entrance to the Pizza Hut staring at us. My first thought is he must recognise Jake, but then I realise it\u2019s Stuart, Jake\u2019s PA.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jake says to him. \u201cAll ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Stuart nods.</p><p>Jake tosses the car keys to him. \u201cI\u2019ll call you when we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries, have a good night ... hello again, Trudy,\u201d Stuart says as he walks past us.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, offering him a smile.</p><p>Stuart hops in the James Bond car and promptly drives away.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Jake says, taking hold of my hand.</p><p>My skin tingles at his touch again. He\u2019s so much more tactile than he used to be, I notice.</p><p>He walks me to the entrance of the Pizza Hut.</p><p>I stop and look up at the sign, then back to Jake.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to Pizza Hut?\u201d I grin.</p><p>He remembers.</p><p>That was what he meant in the car with the comment about my birthdays.</p><p>Every birthday we would come here, it was kind of a tradition with us \u2013 and who doesn\u2019t love Pizza Hut, right?</p><p>I can\u2019t believe he remembers. I feel all warm and squishy inside, and also a little overdressed.</p><p>He smiles back at me, it reaches all the way to his beautiful blue eyes. \u201cLike I said, I\u2019ve got twelve birthdays to make up for. I know it\u2019s not the one we used to go to in Manchester, but I figured you wouldn\u2019t want to drive all the way up there, so this was the next best thing. After you ...\u201d he gestures for me to pass him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My heart is buzzing around my chest at his thoughtfulness. I walk past him and make my way down the stairs.</p><p>Jake is the only guy I know who would pick me up in an Aston Martin DBS then bring me to Pizza Hut. And that\u2019s why I love him.</p><p>I mean, of course I don\u2019t love him \u2013 love him. I just used to love him when I was younger.</p><p>Anyway, the Covent Garden one is a little smarter than the usual Pizza Huts\u2019. Especially the one we used to go to in Manchester, at least from the outside. For starters, it\u2019s underground and you have to take the stairs to reach it, but once you get inside it\u2019s just a regular Pizza Hut and I love it.</p> <p>I\u2019m greeted at the bottom of the stairs by a waiter. The instant he sees Jake, nerves and awe light his eyes up.</p><p>I feel sorry for him, as it must be a shock when the biggest rock star in the world turns up unannounced in your place of work. I mean Pizza Hut is not where you\u2019d usually expect to see Jake Wethers.</p><p>It\u2019d pretty hard not to be overawed but I think he does okay overall. He doesn\u2019t ask for Jake\u2019s autograph which is a good start, because I totally would have.</p><p>As I glance around, I see the restaurant is empty.</p><p>Surprising, but lucky as I\u2019m pretty sure Jake would have got hassled non-stop for autographs in here. Hopefully, it will stay quiet while we\u2019re here.</p> <p>The waiter shows us over to a booth table. I slide into my seat, Jake sits opposite me.</p><p>His legs are long under the table. I bump his leg with my foot.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>He smiles at me.</p><p>It squirms its way through me. I feel like I\u2019m a teenager all over again.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you some drinks?\u201d the waiter asks handing us our menus.</p> <p>Jake looks at me.</p><p>\u201cBeer,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cTwo buds,\u201d Jake orders.</p><p>The waiter disappears to get our drinks while I stare at Jake, surprised.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks, seeing my staring.</p><p>\u201cUm ... nothing.\u201d My face flames.</p><p>\u201cNo, go on,\u201d he urges, leaning forward, he rests his arms on the table.</p><p>\u201cWell, I just thought you didn\u2019t drink anymore \u2013 you know \u2013 rehab.\u201d I say the word quietly, like it\u2019s a really inappropriate word to be saying.</p> <p>He lets out a laugh. \u201cDrinking was never the problem, Tru.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>He leans back in his seat. \u201cThat\u2019s the press for you. But still, everything in moderation for me nowadays. Except drugs \u2013 they\u2019re completely off the menu of course, but my cigarettes have increased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you start smoking?\u201d I ask, wondering if it was after he got clean as a replacement for the drugs, as he never was interested in smoking when we were teenagers.</p><p>He scrunches up his face in thought. \u201cWhen I started in the band.\u201d</p><p>A while then.</p><p>\u201cBad habit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he agrees. \u201cBut not as bad as being an addict.\u201d</p><p>I instantly tense.</p><p>He smiles. \u201cRelax, Tru. It\u2019s not the worst thing in the world I\u2019ve ever said, and my drug counsellor says I\u2019m supposed to be open about these things.\u201d</p><p>Okay...</p><p>\u201cWas it horrible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Rehab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo \u2013 but I can\u2019t imagine that was a great place to be. I meant being an addict.\u201d</p><p>How can he be so together and so successful, but have been a drug addict? It doesn\u2019t feel like the two should go together. But somehow in him, they did. I guess everyone has a weakness.</p><p>He starts to drum his fingers on the table. \u201cWhen it was good it was great, and when it was bad \u2013 it was really fuckin\u2019 bad. I reached the point when all the highs \u2013 which were basically every day for me, were all bad. And that was when it was time to get clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re clean,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d he smiles.</p><p>The waiter comes over with our beers.</p><p>\u201cAre you both ready to order, or do you need more time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry, I haven\u2019t even looked at my menu, yet,\u201d I say opening it up.</p><p>\u201cGive us another five minutes, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what were you thinking?\u201d I ask looking down at the menu.</p><p>\u201cPizza.\u201d</p><p>I glance up at his smiling face.</p><p>\u201cHa, ha, funny. They do serve pasta and salad here as well you know.\u201d I pull my tongue out at him.</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>I get the impression he remembers so much more than I could have hoped.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to share?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cAre you still greedy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was never greedy!\u201d I say feigning outrage.</p><p>\u201cYou ate like a guy,\u201d he laughs.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying I was fat, Jake Wethers?\u201d I quirk my eyebrow at him.</p><p>\u201cNo. You were always a skinny little thing, I could never actually figure out where it all went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ass. It still does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I remember of your ass it was always nice, I\u2019ll have to check it out later \u2013 I\u2019ll let you know what I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t already check it out coming down the stairs?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I just said that!</p><p>It\u2019s him, he seems to bring out a new found flirty, naughty side of me.</p><p>He grins at me, it\u2019s a sexy smile. My cheeks heat and so do other parts of my anatomy.</p><p>\u201cSo are we sharing or not?\u201d I ask, looking back down at my menu.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re sharing.\u201d</p><p>Why do I always feel like there\u2019s an undertone to everything he\u2019s saying to me?</p><p>But he is a renowned womaniser, so flirting is probably just part of his genetic make-up nowadays.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so we have the exotic choice of \u2013 Posh Pizzas, The Hut Classics or Make Our Own,\u201d I say as I pour my eyes over the menu.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking we could have our old favourite ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d I look up at him laughing. \u201cThe Blazin\u2019...</p><p>\u201cInferno,\u201d he finishes.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had that pizza in years!\u201d I\u2019m still laughing.</p><p>\u201cMe either,\u201d he laughs. \u201cSo that\u2019s what we\u2019re having?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d I beam.</p><p>I close my menu and that\u2019s when I realise he\u2019d never actually opened his.</p><p>He remembered the pizza without even seeing it on the menu.</p><p>I take a swig of my beer.</p><p>Jake signals the waiter over, who has been loitering by the doorway for the last few minutes, and he orders our pizza.</p><p>Jake picks his beer up and has a drink.</p><p>It\u2019s still dead in here. Not one single person has turned up for a pizza.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that it\u2019s quiet in here tonight,\u201d I say echoing my earlier thoughts. \u201cNo fans to hassle you.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cI paid for it to be quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought the place for the evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bought Pizza Hut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Pizza Hut as a whole, Tru,\u201d he grins. \u201cJust this one, rented, for the evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we wouldn\u2019t be interrupted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe he rented out the whole of Pizza Hut so we could have dinner together here, because it was, once upon a time long ago, our place.</p><p>I know he can afford it, easily, but still, it\u2019s crazy sweet.</p><p>\u201cWhere did Stuart take the car to?\u201d I ask, just thinking of it now, and actually why he was waiting outside to take it.</p><p>\u201cHe just took it back to the hotel. He\u2019ll bring it back when we need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your security guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be at the top of the stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, do you remember those matching friendship bracelets you made us with that kit your mom bought you that one Christmas?\u201d he says putting his beer down.</p><p>I wonder what made him think of that.</p><p>\u201cOh God, I really was lame.\u201d I cover my face with my hands, my cheeks burning.</p><p>\u201cI thought they were sweet.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him surprised.</p><p>\u201cDo you still have yours?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I do. But if I tell him I always kept mine because it was just one of the many things that reminded me of him and I could never part with, might sound as lame as it actually is.</p><p>\u201cI still have mine,\u201d he says as if reading my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Now I\u2019m surprised.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d I look at his wrist.</p><p>\u201cIn LA at my house \u2013 so do you still have yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d My voice is lower.</p><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, in the UK, in my tiny flat.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to show it to me later.\u201d His expression suddenly turns serious.</p><p>He wants to come in my flat? My stomach starts doing acrobats across the room.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I cough nervously, my face flaming.</p><p>\u201cHow are your Mom and Dad?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I smile. \u201cThey still live in Manchester, in the same house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding?\u201d he grins.</p><p>I shake my head, no. \u201cAnd my dad\u2019s teaching music now to underprivileged kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe always was a good man. Is it a charity based organisation he works for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to donate some money to it. If it wasn\u2019t for your dad, I would have never picked up a guitar let alone learned how to play one, and I wouldn\u2019t be where I am right now. I owe him a lot.\u201d</p><p>I fill with pride for my dad. He is the best.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called Tuners for Youths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll make the arrangements tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad will be made up when I tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to tell him the donation was from me.\u201d</p><p>I kink my eyebrow in confusion at him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him thinking I\u2019m being a flashy bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t think that, he\u2019s really proud of you.\u201d</p><p>He looks up, surprised. \u201cHe is?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cHe follows your career, like I do. Probably more so \u2013 you know how he is about music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet he wasn\u2019t proud of the drugs ... and women.\u201d His lips turn down at the corners.</p><p>I have the urge to reach out and smooth my finger across them, but I don\u2019t, instead I reach out and put my hand on his arm.</p><p>I see his eyes go to it, then he lifts them back to mine.</p><p>\u201cHe was worried about you, like I was. But he\u2019s really proud of everything you\u2019ve achieved. And to be honest, I think he was quite impressed with all the models and actresses you\u2019ve been pictured with,\u201d I laugh, trying to come off as light-hearted, but if anything my own words sting me.</p><p>Moving my arm away, I pick my beer up. \u201cI bet your mum\u2019s real proud of you.\u201d I take a swig of my beer.</p><p>He shrugs. Glancing down at his beer, he starts to pick at the label. \u201cShe\u2019s proud ... sure, she just worries a lot \u2013 you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but she\u2019s your mum and it\u2019s to be expected,\u201d I say.</p><p>I know Susie feels like she let Jake down over the years. That she should have forced his dad out of their lives. Then what happened to Jake never would\u2019ve happened. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I overheard Susie talking to my mum one day. I never told Jake though.</p><p>He shrugs again, and I get the feeling there\u2019s something more, but I don\u2019t press it, and then the waiter appears with our pizza.</p><p>After that we just fall into conversation like we\u2019ve never been apart.</p><p>We talk school and childhood memories.</p> <p>He tells me stuff about the band and his label, which bands he has signed to it.</p><p>I tell him about my time at university, living with Simone and my job as a music journalist at the magazine.</p><p>But mainly we just talk music, like we used to. Recent and old stuff. And Jakes music.</p><p>I haven\u2019t spoken to anyone about music in the way I\u2019m speaking to Jake now. Not in all my time at university while studying it, and not even in all the time I\u2019ve worked at the magazine.</p><p>It\u2019s how we used to talk about it, with real passion. And to me Jake was and is music, it\u2019s what glued us together, and now it\u2019s like a dam is opening back up and everything Jake is just flowing out of me.</p> <p>One thing I don\u2019t talk about it is Will. And he doesn\u2019t ask.</p><p>I also notice he doesn\u2019t mention Jonny. It must still be so raw for him to talk about.</p><p>I also notice he\u2019s only had the one beer all night. I\u2019m glad because he\u2019s driving. I like that he\u2019s being responsible. Because the Jake I\u2019m used to seeing in the news, never appears responsible, despite all his success.</p><p>But the more time I spend with him, the more I feel like there are two Jake\u2019s.</p><p>The one the world sees, and the one I\u2019m getting to see here. The one I used to know.</p><p>I\u2019ve kept light on the drink too. Funny, because earlier I thought I would need it to get me through the night. But not at all.</p> <p>This is one of the best nights I have had in a long time.</p><p>We talk for hours, and when we\u2019re finished, Jake calls Stuart to let him know he needs him to bring the car, then he pays the bill.</p><p>\u201cLet me pay my half,\u201d I press, as we walk to the exit.</p><p>He laughs. \u201cNo Tru. Just call it birthday present number one of twelve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe you twelve birthday presents too, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I haven\u2019t forgotten. I\u2019ll start collecting on them soon.\u201d</p><p>And there it is, that flirty undertone again.</p><p>No wonder women are always throwing themselves at him. I\u2019m having a pretty difficult time myself not doing just that.</p> <p>Jake gestures for me to go first up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYou still eat like a dude,\u201d he says from behind me. \u201cBut your ass is definitely all woman.\u201d</p><p>I gasp.</p><p>Pausing, I turn and look at him, agape.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he feigns innocence, stopping behind me, but I can see the look in his eyes and he\u2019s close, so very close to me. \u201cI told you I\u2019d let you know what I thought of your ass, and I\u2019m telling you it\u2019s perfect. Even better than I remember.\u201d</p><p>Eyes back front and I\u2019m up those stairs quick march. My insides turning over with embarrassment and want.</p><p>Okay, there I\u2019ve said it. I want Jake.</p><p>He\u2019s beautiful and sexy, and flirty. And he\u2019s a rock star. And he was my boy next-door. But of course nothing is ever going to happen.</p><p>Because he\u2019s Jake Wethers ... and I\u2019m just Trudy Bennett.</p><p>And also I have a boyfriend, which is actually reason number one.</p><p>Stuart is there waiting with the James Bond car, just like Jake said he would be. His security guy in his car behind, ready to follow us.</p><p>The ride back to my place with Jake is a lot quieter than we were in the restaurant.</p><p>I\u2019m not really sure why for him. But for me it\u2019s because I feel sad that the night is over, more than likely I won\u2019t ever see him again. Well apart from on the TV that is.</p><p>He\u2019s pulls up outside my place way too quickly for my liking.</p><p>\u201cThanks for dinner,\u201d I say taking off my seatbelt, turning in my seat. \u201cI had a great time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d His voice sounds deeper, huskier in the dark.</p><p>It does funny things to me.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to get out of the car, I have that same feeling of loss I had when I was leaving him at the hotel, but at least then I knew I was seeing him tonight, but now the night\u2019s over and I don\u2019t have any reason to see him again.</p><p>\u201cSo, I guess I\u2019ll go in, thanks again for the pizza and beer.\u201d</p><p>I reach for the handle, just clicking open the door, when he says, \u201cI\u2019ll walk you to your door. Too many weirdo\u2019s about in London. I want to make sure you get in okay.\u201d</p><p>Pushing open the door, I smile to myself as I exit the car. Jake gets out at the same time. My front door is only thirty feet away, I hardly think anything is going to happen to me in thirty feet.</p><p>Jake walks me up my path, and I get that feeling of being a teenager again. Butterflies and giddiness. The way I would feel when I was crazy about him back then and, he would look at me and my insides would just go nuts.</p><p>I reach my door and fish my keys out of my bag.</p><p>Should I invite him in? I guess it would be rude not to. Even though Simone will die of heart failure when she sees him.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come in for a coffee?\u201d I gesture.</p><p>He looks at my door, then at my face. \u201cI\u2019ve got an early start tomorrow. I really should get back to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>A no then.</p><p>\u201cOh, okay, sure.\u201d I try not to sound as disappointed as I feel.</p><p>Not very rock star sounding to need his sleep ... Oh God ... I was just blown out wasn\u2019t I.</p><p>I\u2019m so slow.</p><p>But it\u2019s fine because I wasn\u2019t inviting him in for anything other than coffee anyway. Obviously he doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m attractive at all. I mean he sleeps with anything with a pulse. But not me apparently. Not that I would have, but anyway, it doesn\u2019t matter. He didn\u2019t fancy me when we were younger, so why should it be any different now.</p><p>\u2018Because I\u2019m not fourteen anymore. And I\u2019m a little prettier than I used to be back then,\u2019 shouts my inner self.</p><p>I suddenly feel like stamping my teenage foot and asking him just what\u2019s wrong with me that I\u2019m not good enough for him now, and why I wasn\u2019t back then.</p><p>But I won\u2019t obviously, because that would be way too weird and majorly embarrassing.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was really great seeing you again. Surreal, but great.\u201d</p><p>Did I just say surreal? Oh God.</p><p>He smiles at me, humour clear in his eyes. \u201cCan I have your number? I don\u2019t want to lose contact again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course!\u201d My voice has gone way squeaky, totally giving me away. Traitor voice. And my heart is pounding at my ribs, threatening a break very soon.</p><p>Jake pulls his phone out of his pocket and I recite my phone number to him, watching as he types it in.</p><p>Adele starts to sing in my bag. As I look down, he lifts his phone, gesturing. \u201cAnd now you have mine.\u201d</p><p>I have Jake\u2019s number!</p><p>I\u2019m tapping out a happy number inside my head myself right now.</p><p>He suddenly leans close to me, lifting his hand, tucking my hair behind my ear, fingers tipping my jaw, he kisses my cheek.</p><p>I close my eyes, absorbing the feel and smell of him. Cigarettes, beer and aftershave.</p><p>\u201cSeeing you again was way better than I ever thought it could be,\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>What?</p><p>By the time my eyes are open, he\u2019s already retreating down the path, heading to his car.</p><p>He stops near the bottom and turns back as if remembering something. \u201cOh, Tru, when I said earlier that you looked great, what I actually should have said was that you look beautiful,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI\u2019ll call you soon.\u201d</p><p>And then he\u2019s back in his car, pulling away.</p><p>I let myself in my flat and fall back against the door, heart still pounding up a storm.</p><p>Then the very next thing I do is get my phone out and save Jake\u2019s number to my contacts.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to that boy last night?\u201d</p><p>Vicky is already advancing through the office toward me and I haven\u2019t even sat down yet.</p><p>\u201cBecause whatever it was, just keep on doing it please.\u201d She grins.</p><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m still trying to recover from last night. It took me hours to get to sleep after my night with Jake, so I overslept. This morning was a rush and the interrogation from Simone prevented me from even grabbing a coffee. I\u2019m also still coming down off my Jake cloud and dealing with the probability of never seeing him again.</p><p>I\u2019ll call you soon.</p><p>He won\u2019t call. Why would he? And even though I have his number, I\u2019m not calling him. Well not yet anyway.</p><p>\u201cI just got off the phone with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake Wethers!\u201d She screams like a teenager. Not like the owner of the successful magazine.</p><p>\u201cJake?\u201d I\u2019m confused. \u201cWhy\u2019s he calling you? No offence,\u201d I add when I see the disappointed look on her face.</p><p>\u201cBecause you my darling are a skinful of magic, and delicious to boot!\u201d</p><p>I hate it when she starts talking in riddles.</p><p>\u201cVicky, I\u2019m a little lost here \u2013 help me out will you?\u201d I chuckle so not to offend her.</p><p>\u201cDid he not speak to you about it last night \u2013 no \u2013 wow, okay, well Jake Wethers just called me and has asked the magazine to host his official bio! Arrghhh!\u201d she screams.</p><p>It\u2019s way too early for Vicky\u2019s hysterical screaming. But wow that is so totally cool.</p><p>\u201cHe called you himself? Don\u2019t they usually have their PA\u2019s do this stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d She screams again. \u201cI know I could not believe it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. That is awesome Vicky! Really awesome! I\u2019m so pleased for you \u2013 for us \u2013 for the magazine!\u201d</p><p>And I might get a chance to see Jake again, maybe.</p><p>I feel a little frisson of excitement buzz inside me at the thought.</p><p>\u201cSo who is his biographer?\u201d I ask taking my jacket off and hanging it on the back of my chair. I wonder if it\u2019s anyone I know. I\u2019m going to probably have to work with them for the spreads ... that is if Vicky is putting me on it. God, I hope she is.</p><p>She cocks her eyebrow at me in confusion. \u201cJake really hasn\u2019t spoken with you about any of this? He never mentioned anything at dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Mentioned what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, my darling girl, I\u2019m happy to tell you that Jake\u2019s official biographer is ... well \u2013 you.\u201d</p><p>What? What?!</p><p>All I can do is stare at her dumbfounded. And then my mobile starts to ring on my desk.</p><p>But I can\u2019t move. I\u2019m frozen to the spot.</p><p>He\u2019s hired me? Jake\u2019s hired me to write his bio without even asking me. Is that even legal?</p><p>Vicky walks over to my desk, peering over at my phone, she picks it up and holds it out to me.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to take this call. It\u2019s Jake.\u201d</p><p>All I can do is stare down at it like it\u2019s a bomb about to go off.</p><p>Why would he do this?</p><p>I mean of course it\u2019s awesome and very flattering that he thinks I could do it, but I\u2019ve never written a book before. I write articles. Little ones that fit on the page of a magazine.</p><p>I don\u2019t think I can write a book.</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>I just don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s done this and why he never talked to me about it. He had ample opportunity last night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All the air has been sucked out of the room.

The magazine can\u2019t pass up this opportunity, Tru.\u201d She looks at me wistfully.</p><p>But I just can\u2019t move my hand to take the phone.</p><p>\u201cAn opportunity Jake didn\u2019t even offer me himself.\u201d My voice comes out croaky.</p> <p>My phone stops ringing.</p><p>We both look down at it.</p><p>Vicky retreats her hand containing my bomb of a phone with it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Jake just wanted to speak to me first. You know with me being your employer. He probably wanted to check it wouldn\u2019t cause any problems with your permanent job here first before offering you the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he say that to you?\u201d I look at her suspiciously.</p> <p>\u201cYes, of course he did,\u201d she answers brightly.</p><p>She\u2019s so lying. He never asked her. I can\u2019t imagine Jake ever asking anyone for anything.</p><p>All he\u2019s done by calling Vicky first, is put me in a position where I can\u2019t say no.</p><p>Did he know that would be the case? And if so, then why would he do that?</p><p>\u201cCall him back,\u201d Vicky urges.</p><p>I shake my head, swallowing down my dry throat. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can. I don\u2019t think I can do this. I can\u2019t write a book, Vicky. I\u2019m a journalist. A music journalist, not a novelist.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can. You are a wonderful writer, my darling.\u201d</p><p>I look up at her, mild panic in my eyes. I know what she\u2019s worried about. She\u2019s worried Jake will pull the bio from the magazine if I don\u2019t write it.</p><p>But he wouldn\u2019t do that.</p><p>\u201cJake will still have the magazine do the feature, even if I don\u2019t take the job, Vicky. He wouldn\u2019t pull it. I know him.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know, honey, I did sort of get the distinct impression you are part of the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>Yes he did.</p> <p>Crap.</p><p>\u201cWhy would he do this?\u201d I say my thoughts out loud.</p><p>She smiles. \u201cMaybe he just doesn\u2019t want to let you go this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he forces me to write his bio? No, that doesn\u2019t make any sense. I\u2019m his friend. You don\u2019t force people to be your friend. I\u2019d be his friend without this.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so confused. I need to sit down. I slump back into my chair.</p><p>Vicky moves round and leans against my desk. \u201cMaybe he doesn\u2019t just want to be your friend,\u201d she says softly. \u201cAnd if that is the case, then this way he gets to ensure he sees a lot more of you, for a long while.\u201d</p><p>My eyes flash up to hers. \u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d</p><p>He had the chance to make a move on me last night, and if I\u2019m being truthful, I probably would have kissed him back if he had kissed me, but he didn\u2019t. And that\u2019s how I know that\u2019s not the reason.</p><p>I just have no clue what his motive is.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s a genuine one. Maybe he thinks I\u2019m a really good writer.</p><p>I scoff at the very thought in my own mind.</p><p>\u201cWell for whatever reason he is doing it,\u201d Vicky says. \u201cThis is a huge opportunity for you and the magazine as a whole. It can only be a good thing, Tru. And maybe Jake recognises that. He\u2019ll know what this will do for your career. Maybe he just wants to help you. He did say to me that he\u2019s been considering doing a bio for a long while now, and with this tour it\u2019s the right time. It was obviously just good fortune that you met back up with him, or it could be someone else getting to hop on that tour bus.\u201d</p><p>Shit. I\u2019m going to have to go on tour with them. Of course.</p><p>I\u2019m so screwed.</p><p>This morning I was worried I was never going to see him again, and now I\u2019m going to be spending a huge amount of time with him, following him around, watching him, learning all about him, while we tour around some pretty cool parts of the world.</p><p>Yes, I am so completely and utterly screwed.</p><p>\u201cCall him,\u201d Vicky urges one last time, placing my phone on my desk, tapping her nail on the screen before leaving me to it.</p><p>I stare at my phone and then with shaky fingers I pick it up and press redial on his number.</p><p>He answers on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cTru,\u201d his voice comes deep and sexy down the line.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jake.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d I say, not really knowing what to say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking it your boss beat me to it?\u201d he states rather than asks.</p><p>\u201cShe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you do it \u2013 the bio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have a choice?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a really long pause. I can practically feel his tension radiating down the line.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a choice, Tru.\u201d He sounds a little pissed off.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I recover. \u201cThat sounded a little shitty, it\u2019s just a lot of information to process this early in the morning. Especially when I haven\u2019t even had a chance to have a coffee yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and I don\u2019t function without coffee,\u201d I say in a Spanish accent. I\u2019m actually fluent in Spanish, something my mum insisted on, and it does comes in handy at times \u2013 well, mainly holiday\u2019s in Spanish speaking countries. And my crap Spanish accent always used to make Jake laugh when we were kids, so I\u2019m aiming for just that again.</p><p>He chuckles, deep and throaty down the line. It does incredible things to me. \u201cI see you\u2019re still an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, and it still takes one to know one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it does ... so you\u2019ll do it?\u201d</p><p>I get the distinct feeling he\u2019s not asking me. And really in what world would I ever say no.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d I smile.</p><p>I can practically feel his grin down the phone.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so as your new boss \u2013 well one of them \u2013 I order you to go get some coffee as I can\u2019t have you talking in that cute Spanish accent of yours all day. You\u2019ll drive me nuts.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll drive him nuts?! In a good or bad way...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m seeing you today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Go get that coffee and I\u2019ll call you back soon.\u201d</p><p>He hangs up, and I sit staring at the phone in my hand, feeling a little dumbfounded.</p><p>And somehow a little played. I just haven\u2019t figured out as to how yet.</p><p>I\u2019m also feeling a little excited \u2013 okay a lot excited. I\u2019m going on tour with The Mighty Storm ... with Jake.</p><p>Shit. And double shit. I\u2019m going to have to tell Will.</p><p>Well that thought quickly dilutes my good mood.</p><p>I don\u2019t go and get a coffee straight away, I go to Vicky\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cYou called him?\u201d She looks up at me hopefully.</p><p>\u201cI called him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?</p><p>\u201cAnd of course I\u2019m doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh thank god! You had me worried for a moment there. Oh, Trudy, you are my superstar!\u201d She gets up from her desk and hugs me in a cloud of her perfume and perfectness. \u201cI knew from the second you stepped into the interview for a job here that hiring you would be the best thing I would ever do.\u201d</p><p>She holds me back by my shoulders, smiling her gorgeous smile at me. \u201cYou, my girl, are going to lift this magazine off the bottom shelf and put it in its rightful place in amongst those glossy\u2019s on the middle shelf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think this exclusive with Jake will do that?\u201d I know it will lift sales but I don\u2019t want her to pin all her hopes on this.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d She nods emphatically. \u201cThis boy is unattainable. Getting a concise straight answer out of him is bad enough, but a full blown insight into his life \u2013 hell, all those women out there who sit listening to his album, watching him on TV, dreaming of Jake Wethers in their beds will wet their panties over this.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p>\u201cAnd they are also going to love the fact that you guys grew up together and have just reunited to do this story. Women will envy you and love you for bringing that man into their houses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d I tuck my hair behind my ear. \u201cI was thinking maybe we should keep that part under wraps.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve been thinking about this, and I don\u2019t want all the attention it will bring me if people find out Jake and me grew up together. And there could be the chance that when the press is delving into mine and Jake\u2019s history together, someone from our former years might just tell the story of what his dad did to him and his mum. I shudder to think. Somehow Jake\u2019s managed to keep that part of his life out of the press, I don\u2019t want to be the reason it comes out.</p><p>Obviously I\u2019m not going to say any of that to Vicky. I\u2019ve already quickly planned out what I\u2019m going to say.</p><p>\u201cI just think it will seem even better if they don\u2019t know of my history with Jake. It might take the focus off the bio when they realise Jake and I have history, and I don\u2019t want that to be the running feature. I want it to be about Jake and Etiquette.\u201d</p><p>She grins at me. \u201cGood thinking. Always the journalist. Have I told you how much I love you lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I grin.</p><p>\u201cWell I do, lots and lots and lots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the tour ... Jake\u2019s said he\u2019s going to see me again today \u2013 assumedly to talk about the tour, but can you give me the heads up now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seeing him again \u2013 today?\u201d she grins, sitting back down.</p><p>She\u2019s like a teenager at times.</p><p>\u201cYes, about business. Brief me about the tour, please, boss?\u201d</p><p>She leans back in her chair. \u201cSeven weeks. Touring Europe for the first three, then America and Canada for the last four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I can come home in-between the dates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are a lot of dates in the tour. It\u2019s pretty intensive \u2013 ten dates in Europe and thirteen in the US and Canada. There is a two week break between Europe and the US, and I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019ll be needed all the time \u2013 but check with Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my column?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to get Jane to cover what you couldn\u2019t manage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Sounds like a plan.\u201d</p><p>I get out of my chair. \u201cWhat did you think of the piece of the interview with Jake that I sent you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally good. I emailed back a few possible changes, have a look \u2013 let me know what your thoughts are. But there\u2019s no rush on finishing it as I think we\u2019re going to use it as the pre-cursor for the bio.\u201d</p><p>I start to leave her office, then stop at the door. \u201cWhy do you think Jake never mentioned the bio to me last night?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cYou said last night was a catch up on old times, so maybe he didn\u2019t want to talk business with you at that point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, maybe... he could have called me first thing this morning ... but I guess it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>She leans forward resting her elbows on her desk. \u201cYou want my honest opinion? I think he asked you out to dinner because he wanted to see you again. I think he hired you for the bio because you\u2019re fabulous at your job \u2013 and also because he wants to have sex with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cVicky!\u201d I screech, eyes wide.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe she just said that.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she says innocently. \u201cI\u2019m merely pointing out the conclusive facts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich conclusive facts?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat Jake wants to have sex with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stop saying that!\u201d My face is flushing bright red. \u201cAnd Jake could have sex with anyone he wants and trust me he wouldn\u2019t want to have it with me.\u201d</p><p>I think of the little brush off at my door last night. I don\u2019t tell her of course.</p><p>She frowns at me and shakes her head. \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t think you realise how gorgeous you are, Tru.\u201d</p><p>I pull a face at her skewered compliment.</p> <p>\u201cAnd yes, you are right. Jake could bed any women he wants to ... but currently I think he wants to bed you.\u201d</p><p>I frown at her. \u201cIt\u2019d be an awful lot of trouble for him to go through just to get laid, when he can have it so easily accessible elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasily accessible can get boring, my darling. And you are right, it certainly would be a lot of trouble to go to.\u201d She raises her eyebrow. \u201cSo I guess that shows the worth of the person as to the level of trouble he\u2019s willing to go to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr just the new challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat too.\u201d She leans back in her chair. \u201cJust be careful, my darling, when mixing business and pleasure. Things can get awful messy sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t intend on mixing anything. I\u2019m with Will, remember.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t think Jake is like that, contrary to popular belief, I think he\u2019s professional in business, I don\u2019t think he screws the staff \u2013 just everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I can imagine Jake Wethers to be the upmost professional.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s being snarky.</p><p>\u201cHe was actually a real gent at dinner last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was?\u201d She smiles, a real genuine smile. \u201cGood. I\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>I ignore the little nag of disappointment, tugging away inside of me, that Jake Wethers, who is well known for screwing anything that moves, had no interest in me whatsoever last night.</p><p>Of course it stings. I would never have slept with him, of course, because of Will. But I would have kissed him for sure.</p> <p>But then kissing is cheating too.</p><p>Ugh, my head is all gooey right now. I need a coffee.</p><p>I\u2019m being irrational and silly that my pride is hurt, I know, but I\u2019m a girl and it\u2019s my prerogative to be just so.</p><p>\u201cYou want a coffee?\u201d I ask Vicky, as I\u2019m leaving her office. \u201cI\u2019m making.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, my darling, thank you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m just heading past my desk, on my way to the kitchen to fire the kettle up when my mobile starts to ring.</p><p>I lean over my desk and grab my phone. It\u2019s Jake. I get little butterflies setting flight in my tummy.</p><p>I\u2019m going to have to knock this off if I\u2019m going to be working with him...</p><p>People don\u2019t work with me, Tru. They work for me.</p><p>Okay, so working for him \u2013 whatever. I hope he\u2019s not as bad a person to work for as it\u2019s claimed he can be.</p><p>\u201cYou had that coffee yet?\u201d he says before I get a chance to speak.</p><p>\u201cNo, debido a las interrupciones constantes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTru, I haven\u2019t got a fuckin\u2019 clue what you just said, but I\u2019ll take the \u2018no\u2019 I caught out of that, as you haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t,\u201d I laugh.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well I\u2019m not calling back again, so listen up. I\u2019m picking you up for lunch because I want to go over with you what will happen on the tour.\u201d</p><p>Do I get a choice?</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t that be your assistant\u2019s job to talk to me about that stuff?\u201d I question.</p><p>\u201cWell if I wanted my assistant to have lunch with you then yeah it would be, but I don\u2019t, so you\u2019re getting me \u2013 okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I already have plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cWith?\u201d</p><p>Do I detect a hint of jealously there, Jake?</p><p>\u201cStarbucks. I meet him every day at one for a coffee and blueberry muffin.\u201d</p><p>I hear him exhale down the line.</p><p>\u201cWould you consider ditching him for me?\u201d His voice has gone all seductive and flirty again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know ... it\u2019s a pretty serious thing me and Starbucks have going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it worth your while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking cake, Tru, lots and lots of cake...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarbucks who?\u201d I giggle</p><p>\u201cCool, be outside your building at one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed, se\u00f1or.\u201d</p><p>I hear him laugh before I hang up.</p><p>I feel absolutely full of glee. Jake is being lovely, and flirty, and I\u2019m seeing him again in just a few hours.</p><p>But no, I need to calm myself down. I\u2019m going to be working for Jake, so I need to keep myself professional.</p><p>He might be an old friend, an incredibly flirty old friend. But that\u2019s Jake. That\u2019s his MO.</p><p>And I need to remember that, and not confuse this into something it\u2019s not.</p><p>The black Land Rover that Dave was following us around in last night is already parked outside my building when I go down at one.</p><p>Dave gets out of the car and walks around, opening the back passenger door for me.</p><p>\u201cHello again,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I whisper shyly.</p><p>I climb in the back and Jake is there waiting for me. Looking his gorgeous rock star self in light blue ripped jeans, a faded black Stone Roses \u2018I Wanna Be Adored\u2019 T-shirt, and the same Converses he wore last night.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says, his voice all rough, and smooth like honey, as Dave closes the door behind me.</p><p>\u201cHey yourself,\u201d I smile.</p><p>I can smell Jake\u2019s scent across the car. Cigarettes and aftershave. It makes my tummy flutter.</p><p>Dave climbs back in the drivers\u2019 seat and pulls us away into the heavy lunchtime traffic.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s your morning been?\u201d Jake asks me.</p><p>\u201cOh, you know, long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch happen?\u201d</p><p>I slide a look at him. \u201cApart from a famous rock star who also used to be my next door neighbour growing up calling me and offering me a job to write his bio on his upcoming tour? No, not much at all.\u201d I shake my head, grinning.</p><p>\u201cIs that all I was \u2013 your next-door neighbour? I thought I earned the title best friend back then.\u201d</p><p>His words make my tummy feel funny. Suddenly empty.</p><p>\u201cYou did ... and we were best friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s been a while, Jake. You don\u2019t just get that status back after one dinner.\u201d I smile again, trying to alleviate whatever this is.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m going to have to work a little harder then to claim my title back,\u201d his voice is low with meaning. He smiles at me, and my heart lurches out of my chest and whams straight into him once again.</p><p>\u201cSo am I allowed to know where we\u2019re going for lunch today, or is that a surprise too?\u201d I give him a light-hearted look, trying to straighten out my erratic heart and shaky emotions.</p><p>\u201cJust back to the hotel. I hope that\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it is.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d eat fish and chips in the backseat of a car if it meant being with you.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just less hassle, means we won\u2019t get bothered,\u201d he adds, as though he has to explain why he\u2019s taking me back to his suite.</p><p>\u201cJake, it\u2019s okay, I understand.\u201d I touch his arm.</p><p>He looks down at my hand on his tattooed arm, then up at my face.</p><p>Something passes in the air between us.</p><p>I withdraw my hand, swallowing down, and shift in my seat.</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me we were just staying at the hotel. I would\u2019ve come over. It\u2019s not too far of a walk.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a stupid, but firm look. \u201cI was picking you up, Tru.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay Mr Bossy ... I hope you\u2019re not gonna be like this for the tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat \u2013 bossy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell when I know what I want I say it ... or take it.\u201d He tilts his head to the side, staring at me for a long moment.</p><p>My legs start to tremble.</p><p>I press my knees together.</p><p>I flicker a nervous glance at Dave, but his eyes are focussed ahead on the road.</p><p>I keep mine ahead too.</p><p>And we ride in silence for the rest of the short ride to the hotel. I\u2019m at a complete loss for words after that little exchange.</p><p>Dave pulls the car into the hotel\u2019s parking lot and then I follow him and Jake through the lot into the hotel and to the lifts.</p><p>I ride up with them both in silence, and leaving Dave out in the hall, I follow Jake into his suite.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe it was only yesterday that I was here to interview him and now I\u2019m going to be working for him. It\u2019s crazy.</p><p>As I follow him I see Stuart at the far side of the living room, sitting on the sofa reading a magazine. He closes the magazine, dropping it onto the coffee table and stands at our arrival.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, feeling a little shy.</p><p>I wonder if he knows I\u2019m going to be working for Jake. I\u2019m sure he will, he\u2019s Jake PA. He\u2019ll know everything about him.</p><p>Probably some things I don\u2019t want to know.</p><p>\u201cHello again,\u201d he smiles at me.</p><p>\u201cIs everything ready?\u201d Jake asks him.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he says to Stuart.</p><p>Stuart gives him a brief nod, and then heads out of the room leaving us alone</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Jake says to me, taking hold of my hand, giving me a fire in my belly again, he leads me across the living room and out onto the terraced balcony.</p><p>The air is refreshing on my skin, not chilly at all, and as I step through the door and out from behind Jake, I see there\u2019s a table set up, with two chairs, and it is filled with tiers of little mini cakes. So many different varieties, cupcakes, cream buns, \u00e9clairs, cheesecakes, and, oh my god, cream filled muffins, and some I can\u2019t even identify.</p><p>I know he said there\u2019d be cake, but I never expected anything like this. And there is also fresh coffee waiting.</p><p>In this moment I just love him. Not love him, love him \u2013 but love him, oh you know what I mean.</p><p>Jake turns seeing my open mouthed expression, and says, \u201cWell you gave up a date with Starbucks for me, it was the least I could do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a little better than Starbucks though,\u201d I say, my voice a little hoarse. \u201cIs this birthday present number two?\u201d</p><p>He squeezes my hand ever so slightly, and smiles, a mysterious smile and leads me over to the table to sit down.</p><p>In the last two days, Jake has done more thoughtful things for me than anyone has ever done in my whole entire life.</p><p>He pulls my chair out for me.</p><p>\u201cWhy thank you kind sir,\u201d I giggle.</p><p>He sits down across from me.</p><p>I feel all fuzzy and up in the clouds here on this penthouse balcony.</p><p>And I also feel like I\u2019m on a date. Which of course I\u2019m not, this is a business lunch, just with lots and lots of yummy scrummy cakes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I let my eyes roam over the cakes. They look fresh and delicious, and I literally don\u2019t know which one to try first. I just want to take a bite of each one.</p><p>Jake laughs at my staring. \u201cYou look like a kid in a candy store. You always did have a sweet tooth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s just so many too choose from, and they are just so damn cute. Where did you get them from?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cJust a little place I know.\u201d</p> <p>Unable to resist anymore, I nick a bit of cream from the cream filled muffin closest to me, and lick it off my finger.</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d I groan. \u201cThis is gorgeous, I think I may have died and gone to cream heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo does this win me back my best friend status?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I might be proposing marriage to you soon, if you keep this up.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. It just slipped out. And I can\u2019t take it back.</p> <p>I know my face is bright red.</p><p>Jake grins at me obviously enjoying my discomfort.</p><p>\u201cShall I pour?\u201d I say gesturing to the coffee, anything to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cI got it,\u201d he says taking hold of the pot.</p><p>Jake pours me a coffee. He looks so funny, sitting there in rock star clothes, covered in tattoos pouring me coffee, while we have afternoon tea together.</p><p>\u201cYou know Jake afternoon tea isn\u2019t very rock and roll. You\u2019re kind of killing your rock star image.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSsh.\u201d He puts his finger to his lips, doing a comical glance around. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to keep it our little secret.\u201d He grins and hands me over my coffee. \u201cAnd shouldn\u2019t it be afternoon coffee?\u201d he adds.</p><p>I furrow my brow in thought. \u201cIs there such a thing?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, smiling, \u201cIf not, then there is now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake and Tru\u2019s afternoon coffee, rock star style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbso-fucking-lutely!\u201d he laughs.</p><p>Laughing, I pick the milk up and add some to my coffee, and then help myself to the cream filled muffin I\u2019d already started on.</p><p>I pick it up and take a bite.</p><p>\u201cHoly creaming Jesus,\u201d I mumble with my mouthful. \u201cThis is amazing.\u201d</p> <p>If I thought that little taste of cream was heaven I was sorely mistaken, because the whole thing; sponge and chocolate-chip and cream, together is bliss. If I die today, then I will die a very happy lady indeed.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Jake, you have to give me the name of this place because I\u2019m going to have to set up a credit account with them.\u201d</p><p>He smiles at me, but I detect a hint of nervousness. I\u2019m instantly curious. \u201cDelivery might be a bit of a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I say taking another bite.</p><p>\u201cBecause the delicatessen is in Paris.\u201d</p><p>I pause mid-bite, staring at him.</p><p>\u201cI had them flown in this morning,\u201d he adds.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I put the cake down.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of my favourite places, I always go there whenever I\u2019m in Paris, and I knew you\u2019d love them so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, Jake ... um ... wow, that is so nice and incredibly thoughtful of you, but you didn\u2019t have to go to any trouble for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. I pay other people to go to the trouble for me, Tru.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Shit, I am so way out of my league here.</p><p>He pulls his cigarettes out. \u201cYou mind if I smoke?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and watch as he lights a cigarette up.</p><p>I can\u2019t exactly complain about his smoking around the food, when he\u2019s just had said food flown in on an aeroplane. From Paris.</p><p>Jesus Christ. This is me getting a little glimpse into just how much pull Jake Wethers actually has.</p><p>But he\u2019s just so erratic.</p><p>He takes me for a simple dinner to Pizza Hut \u2013 well maybe not simple, as he did hire the place out \u2013 but still, it was Pizza Hut. And now today, he\u2019s flown in mini cakes from Paris.</p><p>I feel like my head is spinning from just being around him. I don\u2019t remember him been this confusing when we were younger.</p><p>Straight talking, yes. Confusing, no.</p><p>\u201cSo what does your boyfriend think of you coming on the tour?\u201d he asks out of the blue, taking a sip of his coffee.</p><p>And there\u2019s the straight talking.</p><p>\u201cUm ... I ... um ... he doesn\u2019t think anything yet, because I haven\u2019t had a chance to tell him.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s a lie. I\u2019ve had all morning to ring Will and tell him, but I\u2019m not sure how he\u2019ll take it, so I\u2019m putting it off until tonight when I\u2019ve fed him and seduced him, then I\u2019ll tell him.</p><p>Suddenly the idea of seducing Will while here with Jake, doesn\u2019t feel alluring at all. It actually makes me feel quite unwell.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tell him tonight when I see him,\u201d I add.</p><p>He puts his coffee down and takes a drag of his cigarette. Then reaches down and picks up an ashtray from off the floor beside his chair, placing it on his thigh, he taps the ash into it.</p><p>\u201cAre you doing anything nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um, no, Will\u2019s just coming round to my flat to have some dinner.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s staring at my face, his own impassive.</p><p>\u201cHow did you meet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew him from uni and we bumped into each other on a night out a few years ago. He asked me out and we\u2019ve been together since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t live together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll marry him?\u201d</p><p>What? Personal much.</p><p>I shift uncomfortably in my seat. I hate it when he starts being direct like this.</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m up for a job interview, I\u2019m just not actually sure of the job. Unless he has another one lined up for me that he\u2019s also not told me about.</p><p>For want of something to do with my fidgety hands, I dip my finger in the cream of my half-eaten bun again and pop it in my mouth.</p><p>I notice Jake staring at my mouth.</p><p>I quickly pull my finger out, and dry it on a napkin. \u201cWell I was proposing marriage to you a few minutes ago,\u201d I laugh. He doesn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I shrug, turning serious. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I\u2019ve thought about. I guess I don\u2019t really see myself ever getting married.\u201d</p><p>He has another drag of his cigarette and slowly blows the smoke out from between his lips, tapping his ash into the ashtray.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I shrug again, looking down.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to tell him that I don\u2019t think any guy would ever ask me.</p><p>\u201cI always figured you\u2019d end up with a musician,\u201d he says, in a low voice.</p><p>I look up at him surprised.</p><p>Surprised that he even considered that about me.</p><p>\u201cSo how long are you in the UK for?\u201d I ask, for want of a subject change.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flying back to LA first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, disappointed he\u2019s leaving so soon. \u201cDo you have a private jet?\u201d I ask, being nosey.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s the label\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the label which you own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>Bloody hell, he\u2019s got his own private jet.</p><p>\u201cSo the next time I see you will be at the tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I feel quite sad that I\u2019m not going to see him for two weeks.</p><p>\u201cSome best-friend you are,\u201d I pout, jokingly. \u201cYou do remember that in the contract for being my best friend it has a beck-and-call clause in it don\u2019t you. I mean what if I need ... I don\u2019t know \u2013 chocolates from Belgium, who\u2019s gonna get them while you\u2019re off in LA. I don\u2019t know Jake, I might have to seriously consider trading you in,\u201d I grin.</p><p>He chuckles, amused. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t miss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said I\u2019d miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never said you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>God, he\u2019s so bloody quick. I\u2019m getting whip-lash just sitting here with him.</p><p>\u201cI just want you for your cupcakes,\u201d I say jesting. \u201cAnd talking of cakes, will you help me eat some of them before I scoff them all and get seriously fat ... and while you\u2019re at it tell me about the tour too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t ever imagine you\u2019d get fat, Tru ... but your wish is my command.\u201d</p><p>And he grins in that sexy way he does; the one where I definitely know there\u2019s something going on behind it, I\u2019m just not entirely sure what, as he leans forward and picks up one of the cakes.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Will\u2019s at the door with a bottle of wine in his hand, looking as handsome as always.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says pulling me into his arms, he kisses me firmly on the mouth.</p><p>\u201cHey yourself,\u201d I smile up at him.</p><p>He releases me and I walk back down the hall and into our living room. Simone\u2019s out with her work colleagues tonight so it\u2019s just me and Will, and I have big plans of seduction for him, and then to tell him about working for Jake and the tour.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to eat now? Dinner\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely, I\u2019m starving .What are we having?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLasagne,\u201d I answer heading for the kitchen.</p><p>Will follows me into the kitchen and sets about opening the wine, while I dish up the lasagne.</p><p>I carry both our plates through to the living room, putting them down on the coffee table, while Will brings through the wine.</p><p>I sit down on the floor and Will sits opposite me.</p><p>I take a sip of my wine, watching Will as he tucks into the lasagne.</p><p>\u201cThis is good,\u201d he says. \u201cYou make the best lasagne ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, baby.\u201d</p><p>Seeing as though he\u2019s happy with my culinary skills I decide to tell him about the tour now.</p><p>I spoke to him this afternoon on the phone, he\u2019d called when I was out at lunch so I called him back. For some reason I didn\u2019t tell him I\u2019d had lunch with Jake. I think mainly it was because I would have had to tell him about the tour and I wanted to do that tonight. He did quiz me about my night with Jake though, naturally, which I also downplayed quite a lot.</p><p>He scoffed when I said we\u2019d been to Pizza Hut. It really annoyed me to be honest, he can be such a snob at times, so I didn\u2019t even bother to explain the relevance of it to Jake and me.</p><p>\u201cSo I was ... um ... offered this amazing opportunity at work today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes?\u201d he says, forking lasagne into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWell ... Jake ... Wethers has asked the magazine to cover his official biography ... and well ... he\u2019s asked me to write the bio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s wonderful news,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cYes it is. But ... um ... the other thing is that to do so I\u2019ll have to go on tour with the band, you know to follow Jake around, write about the tour and the band. Especially as it\u2019s their first tour without Jonny.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s brows knit together. \u201cSo you\u2019re going on tour with Jake Wethers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and the rest of the band.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo my girlfriend \u2013 my very beautiful girlfriend is going on tour with a bunch of musicians, one of whom is Jake Wethers, the notorious womaniser.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, mildly. \u201cBut what Jake is or isn\u2019t is, is of no relevance to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though you used to be best friends growing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich was twelve years ago.\u201d</p><p>But doesn\u2019t feel like Jake and me have been apart at all, we\u2019ve fallen back in line with each other with such ease. I omit that though.</p> <p>\u201cAnd if I said I didn\u2019t want you to go ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I kind of hoped you wouldn\u2019t want me to go but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d still go anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s an amazing opportunity for me, Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He nods. \u201cSo how long would you be gone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe tour\u2019s for seven weeks in total, with a two week break after the first three in Europe. Then it\u2019s four weeks in the US and Canada, then done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll be gone for three weeks to start with.\u201d He sounds unhappy.</p><p>I nod. \u201cBut I will do my best to get home if I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve already said you\u2019ll definitely do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The magazine really needs this. And this is a published book I\u2019m talking about here, writing a book on a band like The Mighty Storm will be huge for my career. It could open up all kinds of doors for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why ask you? You\u2019ve never wrote a book before.\u201d</p> <p>Wow, thanks for the support.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I have been writing for a long time, and there is first time for everything, Will. You know maybe Jake actually thinks my writing is good, and he\u2019s a good friend so he thought he\u2019d help me out by giving this opportunity to me. You know supporting me in my career \u2013 which was what I was kind of hoping you would do.\u201d I drop my fork onto my plate with a clatter.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he backtracks. \u201cI am supportive and I\u2019m pleased for you, it\u2019s just a little out of the blue, and I\u2019m sad that I\u2019m going to have to be without you for such a long time.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, I get up, and walk around to him and sit in his lap. He puts his fork down on his plate and wraps his arms around me.</p><p>\u201cThe time will fly by, baby,\u201d I say, kissing his cheek. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll be back home and everything will be back to normal. Except I\u2019ll be writing a book.\u201d I can\u2019t help the smile that spreads across my face.</p><p>Will touches my face, brushing my hair back. \u201cI am really pleased for you, darling. I\u2019m just going to miss you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you too.\u201d</p><p>He leans in and presses his lips to mine. He tastes of red wine and lasagne.</p> <p>I wrap my arms around his neck kissing him back. I part my lips and his tongue moves in my mouth.</p><p>I turn in his lap so I\u2019m straddling him, kissing him still. He groans in my mouth.</p><p>Normally when Will makes that sound it really turns me on, but for some reason I don\u2019t feel as turned on.</p><p>I push myself closer to him, trying to ignite a fire in my belly.</p><p>I feel Will get hard beneath me. He puts his hands on my ass, and pulls me hard onto him.</p><p>But still nothing is happening for me.</p><p>I\u2019m probably just tired, and overwhelmed with everything that\u2019s happened over the last few days. I\u2019ll get turned on any second now, I\u2019m sure of it.</p><p>But I don\u2019t feel any different when he\u2019s leading me into my bedroom, and undressing me, and making love to me. And I can\u2019t for the life of me figure out why not.</p><p>It\u2019s half ten when Adele starts singing, telling me I have a text. I must change my ring tone.</p><p>Will is already asleep. He fell asleep pretty much right after we made love, but I\u2019ve been laid here for ages unable to sleep watching the TV in my room with the sound low.</p><p>I whip my phone up off my nightstand, silencing it. Then I see the text is from Jake. My heart jumps in my chest.</p><p>With nervous fingers, I open up the text:</p><p>So I\u2019m sitting here bored shitless and I was thinking about that time when we blew off school, when it was that mad heat wave that one summer, and we took the train to Hebden Bridge so we could go swimming in Lumb Falls ... do you remember?</p><p>Smiling at the memory, I climb out of bed, pulling my dressing gown on and I go into the kitchen, taking my phone with me. I put the kettle on to make a tea. While it\u2019s boiling, I type a text back:</p><p>Of course I do! That was such a fun day, well until you dared me to jump off the high rocks, and I did and when I resurfaced I\u2019d lost my bikini top and you had to go diving for it!</p><p>Laughing to myself I press send. I put my phone onto vibrate so not to disturb Will, then get a cup out of the cupboard and drop a teabag in it. My phone vibrates in my hand:</p><p>That\u2019s what I was remembering ;)</p><p>My face flushes red. Is he flirting with me? I instantly type back:</p><p>Perv! I was only thirteen!</p><p>My phone vibrates immediately:</p><p>So was I. x</p><p>He put a kiss at the end. I grab the milk out of the fridge and type back a reply.</p><p>You\u2019re still a perv ;) Seriously though, I did just want to say thank you again for lunch. I\u2019ve never quite had a lunch like it before.</p><p>I hover my finger over the send button. Then I go back and add a few kisses then press send.</p><p>Me either. I\u2019ll miss u while I\u2019m gone. Be good. x</p><p>He\u2019ll miss me? And he\u2019s telling me to be good. When am I never good? I hold the phone to my chest, contemplating texting him back.</p><p>Unable not to, I quickly tap out a text:</p><p>I\u2019ll miss u 2. And fyi, I\u2019m always good. It\u2019s you that needs to learn the meaning of the word. x</p><p>It\u2019s a minute before he replies:</p><p>I\u2019m starting to. x</p><p>I stare at my phone for a while, confused, until the kettle boils bringing me round.</p><p>I make myself a cup of tea and take it back to bed with me. I climb in bed beside Will. He groans and rolls over in this sleep, facing me.</p><p>I look at him and sip my tea, then it hits me why I didn\u2019t feel turned on before with Will.</p><p>Because of Jake. Because I can\u2019t stop thinking about him.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>I\u2019m in a taxi on my way to Heathrow airport to fly out to Sweden for the first leg of the tour.</p><p>I\u2019m mega excited about this tour, and I\u2019m also really looking forward to seeing Jake again.</p><p>I might not have seen Jake for two weeks, but we\u2019ve been in regular contact; I\u2019ve spoken to him every day. Well, not actually spoken, but we\u2019ve been emailing and texting every day since he texted me that first night.</p><p>It\u2019s like we\u2019ve never been away from each other. The last twelve years dissolving into irrelevance.</p><p>Some of the emails and texts have been a little flirty, mostly on his part, but I\u2019ve made sure not to cross any line. I don\u2019t want to blur things and give Jake the wrong impression.</p><p>I\u2019m not up for being another notch on his incredibly long belt, even if he is gorgeous and lovely, and so very sweet to me. It\u2019s not worth losing Will over.</p><p>And Will ... well things have been amazing these last few weeks. It\u2019s been like it was when we first got together. Hot sex everywhere.</p><p>It seems that lag I had, which I\u2019m totally putting down to Jake\u2019s huge bang back into my life, vanished with him going back to LA.</p><p>We were in bed together last night, when Will did the sweetest thing...</p><p>\u201cSo I bought you something,\u201d Will said climbing out of bed, leaving me feeling cold without him.</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d I sat up, feeling a little frisson of excitement.</p><p>Will always buys me the best presents, he knows what I like. He knows me so well.</p><p>He retrieved something for his pants pocket, which were slung over the chair at my dressing table, while I admired his hot, tight body and cute bum from behind.</p><p>He\u2019s so gorgeous and lovely. I love that he\u2019s mine.</p><p>He came over and sat down on the bed beside me. \u201cI bought this for you, because I want you to have something to remember me by while you\u2019re gone.\u201d He held out a black, velvet jewellery box.</p><p>\u201cJewellery,\u201d I smiled. My itchy fingers reached out to touch the soft black velvet.</p><p>Will looked a little nervous as I opened it.</p><p>\u201cOn my God! Will it\u2019s beautiful!\u201d I touched my fingers to the platinum chainmail bracelet feeling completely overwhelmed by his thoughtfulness.</p><p>\u201cYou like?\u201d He looked at me hopefully.</p><p>\u201cI love!\u201d I leant forward and kissed him firmly on the lips.</p><p>He held my face in his hands, prolonging the kiss to deep. When he finally released me he removed the bracelet from the box and I held my arm out allowing him to put it on.</p><p>\u201cIt looks perfect,\u201d he said staring down at it. My own eyes fixed on it too. \u201cI want you to wear it all the time you\u2019re away from me, so you have a permanent reminder of me and our life together.\u201d Will\u2019s voice was deep and low.</p><p>My heart started to hurt in my chest at the thought of the length of time I\u2019m actually going to be away from him. The enormity of it finally hit me.</p><p>I felt tears start to prick the backs of my eyes.</p><p>\u201cLike I would ever forget about you,\u201d I said gently. I touched my hand to his face, feeling the starter of his rough stubble under my fingertips.</p><p>Will took hold of my hand, kissing my palm. He started to kiss a path down my arm slowly, making my tummy tingle, as his lips moved over my shoulder and up my neck, until he reached my mouth.</p><p>He took my face in his hands, fingers buried deep into my hair. \u201cI love you so much,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cShow me how much,\u201d I grinned, biting down on my lip.</p><p>Will\u2019s eyes came alive with instant lust, and then he set about showing me just how much he actually does love me for the rest of the night.</p><p>Leaving Will in the morning was really hard. I cried a bunch. He wanted to drive me to the airport but he had an early meeting which he couldn\u2019t get out of, so we said our goodbyes at my flat and I promised to call him as soon as I land in Stockholm.</p><p>I was sad to leave Simone too. We were both a little teary as I was getting in my taxi. Thank God for Brightening Eyes and Touche Eclat, otherwise I\u2019d look a puffy mess right now.</p><p>Simone and I have not been apart since university. Any holidays we go on, we go together, so it\u2019ll be weird been away without her, doing all the fun stuff I imagine I\u2019ll be doing.</p><p>She\u2019s promised to come and visit me on tour, and I don\u2019t doubt she will as she\u2019s desperate to meet Jake and the other guys in the band.</p><p>I\u2019m really looking forward to meeting them too. Obviously, I\u2019ve seen pictures of Tom and Denny, and have read interviews they\u2019ve done, but it\u2019ll be real nice to meet the guys behind those images and words.</p><p>I called my mum and dad to tell them the news of the tour the next day after I\u2019d found out. My dad was ecstatic to put it mildly. Actually he freaked out. He\u2019s like a big kid at times!</p><p>He was also really happy to hear I was back in touch with Jake. My mum seemed a little bit reserved about the whole thing. I know it\u2019s just because she worries about me.</p><p>It was in that call that dad told me about this huge donation they\u2019d received at Tuners for Youths, by an anonymous benefactor, and they were freaking out as the donation was sizeable \u2013 huge in fact ... one million pounds.</p><p>One-freaking-million-pounds!</p><p>I nearly choked when he told me. The charity is only small, so the difference that kind of money will make to them is immense. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jake\u2019s generosity, seemingly knows no bounds. I knew he would make the donation, but a million pounds \u2013 he\u2019s just amazing.</p><p>I was so proud of Jake in that moment. Not that I haven\u2019t been so over the years, but this was different.</p><p>My eyes filled with tears as I listened to my dad telling me all about what they would do with the money. And when I told him it was Jake who had made the donation, I know he was floored. He was silent for a long time.</p><p>I gave my dad Jake\u2019s phone number so he could call him to thank him.</p> <p>I\u2019m guessing he has, but neither Jake or my dad have mentioned it to me and I don\u2019t want to pry.</p><p>I really hope they are back in touch properly, and hopefully they\u2019ll get a chance to actually see each other again, as I\u2019m going to talk to Stuart to see if I can get my folks some tickets to come out and see one of the shows on the tour; I know Stuart deals with all that kind of stuff.</p><p>I know my dad will just love it.</p><p>I\u2019m going to buy the travel and hotel as present for them, and I\u2019m particularly hoping for the gig in Spain, as it\u2019s on a weekend \u2013 a Saturday night, so it\u2019s perfect as they would both be off work and then I could spend the weekend with them. I haven\u2019t spent enough time with them recently.</p><p>I haven\u2019t said anything to them yet. I thought I would wait to make sure I could get the tickets for the gig first.</p> <p>I\u2019m feeling a little daunted by the whole tour thing to be honest, I mean, it\u2019s a huge deal, and the closer I get to the airport the tighter the knots in my stomach become.</p><p>The only person I\u2019ll know on the tour is Jake, and of course he\u2019ll be busy a lot. So when I\u2019m not following him around doing my job, I\u2019m going to be at a loose end, and it could get a little lonely for me. I intend to do plenty of sightseeing in those amazing cities I\u2019ll be going to \u2013 first stop Stockholm.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been and I\u2019m stoked to see the place for the first time. And I\u2019ve already got myself guide books for all the places I\u2019m going too and they are downloaded and ready on my Kindle.</p><p>Geeky, yes. Practical, very.</p><p>The taxi pulls up at Heathrow and the driver kindly lugs my huge suitcase out of the boot for me.</p><p>Slinging my carry-on over my shoulder, I wheel my suitcase into the busy airport.</p> <p>I\u2019m a little nervous about flying alone. I\u2019ve never done it before, but thankfully it\u2019s a short flight, and I\u2019ve got my Kindle and my iPod to keep me company.</p><p>I reach the check-in desk, parking up my case I take my passport and travel details out of my bag.</p><p>Stuart had booked the plane ticket for me and as it was an online booking, he emailed me paperwork to bring with me. He also said one of Jake\u2019s drivers will be there to pick me up. I hope it\u2019s Dave, a familiar face would be good when landing in a strange city. I get the impression that Jake\u2019s drivers are also his security guys, makes sense if you ask me and I\u2019m yet to meet the others. As Dave is the head of Jake\u2019s security there\u2019s bound to be others. I just get the impression Jake always has Dave with him, he seems to trust him implicitly.</p><p>I hand my passport and papers over to the woman behind the desk.</p><p>\u201cCan you put your case on the scales please?\u201d</p><p>I lift it on praying to God I\u2019m not over my allowance. I don\u2019t pack light; I get it from my mum.</p><p>Phew, I just skim in my allowance.</p><p>\u201cOkay so you\u2019re in First Class,\u201d she\u2019s saying, \u201cso that gives you access to the First Class lounge\u2013\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, what?\u201d</p><p>She looks at me like I\u2019m slightly slow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re travelling First Class so that entitles you to use the First Class lounge. Just show them your boarding pass and passport at the reception, and that will grant you access.\u201d</p><p>Jake.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s done this. Actually, yes I can.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thank you,\u201d I say feeling a little breathless, taking back my passport and boarding card from her.</p><p>Stuart had sent me the travel details but I didn\u2019t see anywhere on there that I would I was travelling First Class when I read over them.</p><p>I\u2019ve never had First Class anything in my life. I\u2019m not really a First Class girl. I\u2019m more likely to be found in the standard airport bar getting pissed before the flight, then staggering around duty-free buying more booze for the holiday.</p><p>And I just don\u2019t want Jake spending his money on me like this, even though it\u2019s totally generous and I don\u2019t mean to sound ungrateful ... it\u2019s just ... well I bet he doesn\u2019t have all his staff travelling First Class. I don\u2019t want to be a special case. I don\u2019t want him making allowances because of our history. And as it stands now, I\u2019m part of his staff and should be treated as so.</p><p>I\u2019ll have to make sure he doesn\u2019t do it again. But I\u2019ll make sure to say it in a very nice way.</p><p>I make my way up to the First Class lounge and get myself a drink. Alcoholic of course, white wine; I know it\u2019s early but I\u2019m on vacation, kind of, and well I\u2019ve just had a bit of a shock with this whole First Class thing, and the wine is just to insanely delicious to turn down.</p><p>And the lounge is amazing, sumptuous; it\u2019s better than my whole flat.</p><p>Seeing as though I\u2019m here, I may as well make myself at home, so I get myself well acquainted with the lounge and pick a window seat, one of the most comfortable seats I have ever rested my derri\u00e8re in, and I can sit and watch the planes taking off from here.</p><p>I retrieve my Kindle from my bag, to read a book while I wait for my flight.</p><p>I try to read, but I just can\u2019t focus, as my mind keeps flickering back to Jake and the whole First Class thing.</p><p>Despite my feelings about it, I really should thank him. I get my phone out of my bag and type out a text:</p><p>So I\u2019m sitting in the first class lounge, in the most comfortable seat my ass has ever graced, sipping on the best glass of wine I\u2019ve ever tasted, courtesy of this amazingly generous guy who paid for my ticket. You don\u2019t happen to know who he is do you? x</p><p>I get a text back a minute later:</p><p>Nope not a clue. ps. I wish I was the chair ;) x</p><p>I reply:</p><p>Thank you. Not necessary ... but so totally awesome! ... and behave! :) x</p><p>I get a text immediately back:</p><p>This is me behaving ;) And well, I couldn\u2019t have my best friend flying coach, could I :) I\u2019m already in Stockholm so I\u2019ll see u in a few hours. x</p><p>I get a frisson of energy rush through me about the tour, and about seeing Jake.</p><p>I might be nervous about the whole tour and bio thing, but I\u2019m also totally excited too. It\u2019s a huge opportunity to be touring with The Mighty Storm.</p><p>Smiling to myself, I reply:</p><p>Cool. Have I mentioned I\u2019m excited about the tour? It\u2019s gonna be so totally epic! x</p><p>His reply comes a couple of minutes later:</p><p>A few times ;) And sure it is, it\u2019s a TMS tour ... with the added bonus of u. x</p><p>He can be so sweet at times. I\u2019m getting the warm and fuzzies again, and getting more and more keen to see him as the time nears.</p><p>The announcement of my flight boarding comes over the tannoy. I quickly tap out a reply to him:</p><p>Boarding now. See u on the other side. x</p><p>I drop my phone in my bag and make my way to the gate. While I\u2019m in the queue, I get my phone out again to see if he\u2019s replied. He has:</p><p>Can\u2019t wait. x</p><p>Butterflies take flight in my stomach.</p><p>Me either. And I\u2019m really going now. x</p><p>While I have my phone out, I quickly type out a text to Will letting him know I\u2019m boarding and that I\u2019ll call him when I land. Then a quick one to Simone saying pretty much the same.</p><p>I switch my phone off, drop it in my bag, hand my boarding pass to the guy waiting, and make my way onto the plane and to my First Class seat.</p><p>Okay, so I am totally flying First Class all the time. It is just awesome, and you get so well looked after. I had two glasses of champagne on the plane and they give you them for free!</p><p>I\u2019m currently feeling a little fizzy happy.</p><p>I\u2019m off the plane and just going through customs, and glad I wore one of my loose fitting skater shirts to travel in as it\u2019s boiling here in Stockholm.</p><p>The skirt I\u2019m wearing is blue with a gold chain print on it and longer than the black one I wore to Jake\u2019s interview. It\u2019s respectably long; serious writer long, well a few inches above the knee, but still very smart, and I\u2019m wearing my three-quarter length sleeved sweatshirt, but the material is thin so it\u2019s not too bad in this heat, and I\u2019m wearing my gold ballet shoes.</p><p>Flats, I don\u2019t wear them often, but ideal for travelling in.</p><p>I wanted to look nice, as it\u2019s the first time I\u2019m seeing Jake in two weeks, and quite possibly meeting the other guys in the band.</p><p>I get a fizz of excitement running through my bloodstream at the very thought.</p><p>I\u2019m through customs pretty quickly, and then on to retrieve my suitcase.</p><p>While I\u2019m waiting for my suitcase, I get my phone out and switch on roaming, then call Will.</p><p>\u201cHey baby.\u201d He sounds all deep and lovely. \u201cYou got there okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. I\u2019m just waiting for my case now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how is Sweden so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cI miss you already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still wearing your bracelet?\u201d</p><p>I touch my wrist. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>I spot my suitcase making its way around the conveyor. \u201cMy case is coming so I\u2019m gonna go. I\u2019ll call you later. Love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay baby. Love you too.\u201d</p><p>I hang my phone up and just catch my suitcase in time, before it sets off to make the journey back around.</p><p>Then I head toward arrivals. I spot Dave immediately, and am so relieved it\u2019s him waiting for me.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cGood flight?\u201d he asks, in his super deep voice, taking my suitcase from me.</p><p>\u201cIt was awesome,\u201d I beam.</p><p>He looks at me a little puzzled. My cheeks flush. He\u2019s probably used to the whole first class thing working for Jake.</p><p>\u201cThe car\u2019s just outside.\u201d</p><p>I follow Dave through the airport and over to a brand-new black Mercedes SLK, presumably a hire, parked up in one of the drop-off and pick-up bays.</p><p>The windows are heavily tinted on the car. I guess they have to be for when Jake\u2019s travelling in it.</p><p>Dave parks my suitcase at the side of the car and gets my door for me.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say climbing in, and then my heart nearly leaps out of my chest.</p><p>Jake is sitting in the backseat of the car, waiting for me, a huge smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I beam at him. The door shuts with a clunk behind me and then without thinking, I throw my arms around his neck, hugging him tight.</p><p>His arms go around me, hugging me back, just as tight I notice.</p><p>And for this brief, momentary hug, all I can do is breathe him in. His scent soothes through me, and I feel like I\u2019m home.</p><p>I didn\u2019t realise just how much I was missing him until this very moment. Or maybe I just didn\u2019t allow myself to feel it for fear of how I would feel, like how I do, right now, here in his arms.</p><p>Just so completely overwhelmed by the emotion and level of feelings I have for this man. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you came to pick me up!\u201d I say still beaming a smile, releasing myself from him.</p><p>Jake lets me go, but keeps me close, taking hold of my hand.</p><p>And once again my skin simmers under his hand. I wonder if I\u2019ll ever stop feeling like this from his touch.</p><p>A big part of me hopes not.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad I did now, if it meant getting a welcome like that,\u201d he grins. He\u2019s being all flirty again.</p><p>\u201cI was just hanging around the hotel, so I thought I\u2019d come ... sorry I couldn\u2019t come in the airport to meet you ... you know,\u201d he shrugs.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He\u2019d have probably been recognised and mobbed in ten seconds flat.</p><p>It must be pretty hard being a prisoner of your own success. Never able to go anywhere alone.</p><p>A simple thing like walking through an airport alone would probably mean the world to him if he was able to do it.</p> <p>Dave gets in the driver\u2019s seat, turns the engine on and the radio comes to life.</p><p>I pull my seat belt on, using one hand, as Jake doesn\u2019t seem willing to let go of my hand.</p><p>\u201cHow was your flight?\u201d Jake asks, as we start moving out of the airport.</p><p>\u201cIt was awesome thanks to you \u2013 did you know you get free champagne in first class ... of course you know ...\u201d I peter off at his amused expression.</p><p>\u201cYou make me laugh.\u201d He squeezes my hand, rubbing his thumb over my skin, continuously leaving a delicious trail wherever it goes.</p><p>\u201cIn a good way, I hope?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlways in a good way.\u201d He turns his head to the side, directing a fixed look at me. I shiver inside, looking away.</p><p>We\u2019re quiet for a moment, before Jake says anything more.</p><p>\u201cSo I spoke to your dad last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did!\u201d My face nearly cracks with the smile on it.</p><p>His lips quirk up at the corner. \u201cYeah, he called to thank me for the donation...\u201d He lifts an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d I say innocently. \u201cYou never said it was a secret. You just said you didn\u2019t want him thinking you were a flashy bastard \u2013 and he didn\u2019t.\u201d I push my lips out into a pout.</p><p>He shakes his head, laughing at my expression.</p><p>\u201cSo you talked?\u201d I probe.</p> <p>\u201cWe did, it was good to talk to him after all these years. He\u2019s still just the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talk music?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He slides me an amused look. \u201cSo I brought something for you,\u201d he says, changing tact.</p><p>He reaches into his jean pocket, pulling something back out. I recognise it instantly. It\u2019s the friendship bracelet I made him all those years ago. It\u2019s a little frayed, the white, black and blue fabric faded slightly.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you actually kept it.\u201d My words come out with my breath.</p><p>\u201cYou thought I was lying?\u201d He screws his face up.</p><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m just surprised ... hang-on.\u201d I let go off his hand and reach forward into my bag in the foot-well, unzipping in the inside pocket to I get what I\u2019m looking for.</p><p>My friendship bracelet.</p><p>I brought mine with me too. I put it in my carry on; I didn\u2019t want it in my suitcase in case it got lost in transit. This bracelet is irreplaceable, so I wanted it safe.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I brought it, we hadn\u2019t arranged to. I guess I just hoped he would have his with him too.</p><p>And he has ... I can\u2019t believe it.</p><p>\u201cI brought mine too,\u201d I say holding my hand out, showing it to him.</p><p>Mine is exactly the same as his \u2013 in my geekdom I made us matching ones.</p><p>He stares down at it, then lifting his eyes to mine, smiles and says, \u201cGreat minds.\u201d</p><p>My heart is flopping around in my chest like a fish out of water.</p><p>\u201cHow old were we when you made these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019re like ... sixteen years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPractically antiques,\u201d I smile.</p><p>Jake takes hold of my hand and pushes the platinum chainmail bracelet that Will bought me, further up my arm.</p><p>He removes my friendship bracelet from my hand, placing it on his leg. Then I watch as he takes his own friendship bracelet and slips it on over my hand and tightens it to fit around my wrist.</p><p>Then he picks mine up, loosening it, he puts it his own arm.</p><p>I let out the breath I didn\u2019t realise I was holding.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever take it off,\u201d he says, voice deep with meaning.</p><p>\u201cNot even to shower?\u201d I swallow down.</p><p>\u201cNot even to shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll keep yours on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d He takes hold of my hand again.</p><p>And my heart leaps out of my chest, then thuds its way back in.</p><p>I rest back in the seat. I\u2019m going to have to be so careful. Jake is a naturally tactile person, incredibly sweet, and obviously happy to have me back in his life as his friend again.</p><p>I\u2019m going to have to be very careful to not confuse this with him having any feelings for me, in that way. And also to make sure I don\u2019t let my own feelings get confused too.</p><p>We talk all the way back to the hotel, and Jake points things out to me, important buildings and sites, as we drive through this amazing city.</p><p>Dave parks the car in the hotel lot; we\u2019re staying at the Grand Hotel Stockholm. And grand is how it most certainly looks from the outside.</p><p>When we arrive there is a guy waiting for us in the parking lot, seemingly expecting our arrival.</p><p>Jake introduces me to him as Ben. He\u2019s one of Jake\u2019s other security guys. He works under Dave.</p><p>Security seems a little tighter for Jake here. Maybe it\u2019s because of the hype of the tour, brings the crazies out.</p><p>Ben, I\u2019d guess, is in his early thirties and attractive in a Jason Statham kind of way.</p><p>I follow along with the three men, Ben wheeling my suitcase for me.</p><p>We all ride in silence up in the lift, getting out on the top floor.</p><p>I follow Jake down the hall, Dave and Ben behind us.</p><p>Jake stops outside a door and produces a key card from his back pocket.</p><p>\u201cThis is your room for the next few days.\u201d</p><p>He opens the door and I step through. I actually gasp.</p><p>This isn\u2019t a room. It\u2019s a bloody suite. And a huge one at that.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Jake says to Ben and Dave. \u201cI got it from here.\u201d</p><p>Ben parks up my suitcase just inside the room and closes the door behind him.</p><p>I slowly turn around to face Jake.</p><p>\u201cJake this is awesome ... but it\u2019s too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the suites on the floor are the same size,\u201d he shrugs.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m just one person, I don\u2019t need all this room.\u201d I wave my arms around.</p><p>\u201cSo am I, and I\u2019m staying in one exactly the same as this.\u201d He seems a little irked by my statement.</p><p>\u201cI just ...\u201d I can\u2019t seem to find the right words. I run my fingers through my hair. \u201cAre all your staff staying in suites like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>He meets my eyes. \u201cTom, Denny, Stuart, Smith and Dave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the floors below.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn normal sized rooms ... rooms that are just that \u2013 one room and a bathroom.\u201d</p><p>He nods, slowly, not moving his eyes from mine.</p><p>\u201cI should be in one of those rooms, Jake.\u201d</p><p>He looks little annoyed now, and also a little hurt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to sound ungrateful, Jake, but the first class at the airport, and now this ... I don\u2019t want you spending money on me like this.\u201d</p><p>He folds his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s my money; I can do what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but ...\u201d I\u2019m at a loss to find a plausible and strong enough argument against him. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to piss your other staff off when they find out I\u2019m staying in such a lovely suite.\u201d</p><p>His face lightens. \u201cTru, you won\u2019t piss anyone off, it\u2019s not in you to be able to do so, and anyway you\u2019re important. You\u2019re writing my bio, so I have to keep you sweet so you write nice things about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh, so that\u2019s what all this niceness has been about.\u201d I kink my eyebrow.</p><p>He grins. \u201cNot at all, but if it gets you to stay in this room with no complaint, then I\u2019m sticking with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuite ... not room,\u201d I correct.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d he waves me off. \u201cSo you wanna unpack first or do you wanna meet the guys now?\u201d</p><p>I glance at my suitcase.</p><p>Hmm, let me think unpack or meet rock stars...</p><p>\u201cMeet the guys,\u201d I beam.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get too excited,\u201d he frowns. \u201cThey\u2019re uglier in real life than they look in their pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you jealous, Jake Wethers?\u201d I tease.</p><p>\u201cMe \u2013 jealous? Never. Come on.\u201d He opens the door. \u201cI left those idiots in my room draining my mini-bar when I came to get you, knowing those greedy bastards they\u2019ll still be there, saving their own for later.\u201d</p><p>I can hear the male voices laughing and joking as we approach Jake\u2019s door. I get a little ball of nervous energy in my tummy the closer we get.</p><p>I am, in a few seconds, about to be standing in a room with some of the best musicians the world currently has to offer.</p><p>I\u2019m going to be in a room with The Mighty Storm!</p><p>I\u2019d have to be crazy not to be a little excited.</p><p>Jake opens his door, allowing me through first, putting me immediately in the living room and I see the guys all sitting around the dining table, playing cards, drinking beer.</p><p>\u201cTru, this is Denny.\u201d Jake stands behind me, he places his hand on my lower back and points over my shoulder at a dark haired guy, who is very cute, and who of course I instantly recognise.</p><p>Even distracted by Denny, I still tense under Jake\u2019s touch.</p><p>\u201cDenny \u2013 this is Tru, my old friend from Manchester, and biographer for the tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey Tru, it\u2019s great to finally meet you,\u201d Denny smiles at me, running his hand through his short haired.</p><p>Finally meet me? So Jake\u2019s already told him about me?</p><p>Of course he has dopey, you are their biographer.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I smile nervously at him.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is Smith, our session guitarist who is playing lead for us on the tour.\u201d Jake points at the only person in the room I don\u2019t recognise.</p><p>And sweet baby Jesus, he is gorgeous. Long, messy blonde hair and dark green eyes. He looks like a surfer.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Smith says in a Southern drawl giving me a nod.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s married,\u201d Jake whispers in my ear. I feel his fingers tense against my back.</p><p>What?</p><p>I look up at Jake, wanting to ask him what the hell he meant by that with a look, but he\u2019s not looking at me.</p><p>\u201cAnd not forgetting, Tom,\u201d Jake says pulling my eyes away from him and back across the room.</p><p>Tom has his back to me, but of course I instantly recognise him the second he turns around in his seat to us.</p><p>Tom has light-brown hair, shaved close, and he is covered in tattoos, just like Jake. He is really good-looking, not my type, his face is a little to round for my liking; I like my men a little more chiselled, but I can certainly see the allure for the women who love him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe-llo gorgeous.\u201d Tom gets up from his chair.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jake says sternly, pointing a finger at him, stopping him in his tracks.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tom says innocently, holding his hands up in surrender style. \u201cI was just coming over to say hello to the gorgeous Trudy, and to greet her in my genuine Tom style ... and also to find out where he\u2019s been hiding you,\u201d he says directly to me, conspiratorially winking.</p><p>I actually blush.</p> <p>What am I \u2013 sixteen?</p><p>\u201cYeah, and your style usually involves tongues and groping. Tru has had a long flight and can do without you pawing her \u2013 and also she has a boyfriend, so hands off.\u201d Jakes sounds so protective, like he\u2019s my big brother or something. Maybe that\u2019s how he views me, in a sister like fashion.</p><p>The thought depresses me a little. Well, quite a lot actually.</p><p>\u201cJeez, down boy \u2013 I get it.\u201d Tom rolls his eyes at Jake, laughing he sits back down in his chair and takes a swig of his beer.</p><p>\u201cYou want something to drink?\u201d Jake asks me, as he starts to move away.</p> <p>I suddenly feel a little bereft without his touch. And still a little saddened by the brotherly protectiveness.</p><p>\u201cNo I\u2019m fine thanks ... you know, I think I will go and unpack my suitcase ... leave you guys to finish your game.\u201d I gesture to the on-going card game being played at the table.</p><p>Jake stops, turning to look at me. \u201cYou sure?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure,\u201d I smile. \u201cI\u2019ll see you all later,\u201d I wave in the guy\u2019s direction. \u201cIt was nice to meet you all.\u201d</p><p>I turn and leave the room, acutely aware of the fact that Jake\u2019s eyes are on me the whole time I\u2019m walking away.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p> <p>It\u2019s my second day in Stockholm and tonight is TMS\u2019s first show.</p><p>I\u2019m at the stadium with the band. The opening show is at the Ericsson Globe. It\u2019s the strangest and most cool building I have ever seen. It\u2019s shaped like a large white ball. It\u2019s also quite a small venue for the guys, it only takes about sixteen thousand people, there\u2019s the Stockholm Stadium which hosts double that, but I think the guys wanted to kick the tour off with a small venue to start with.</p><p>I\u2019m sitting out in the seats watching them rehearse for tonight, while the roadies get everything set up for tonight\u2019s show.</p><p>It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever seen Jake up on stage with my own two eyes, and not watching him through a TV screen.</p><p>He looks at ease up there, but I can tell he\u2019s a little on edge. I can see it in his eyes. That little lost look he gets. He exudes calm control to everyone, but I can tell. He was the same when we were kids.</p><p>Other people probably miss it, but I see it, I\u2019ve always seen it in him.</p><p>I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s on edge because it\u2019s his first show since Japan. I think he struggles on stage without Jonny by his side. It must be hard for all of them, and for Smith too, having to fill the stage where such a big presence once stood.</p><p>I spent yesterday in the hotel with Jake and the guys. After I\u2019d finished unpacking and calling my dad, Will and Simone, Jake came knocking to see if I wanted any food. The guys were ordering room service up. Surprisingly, they weren\u2019t going out partying.</p> <p>Maybe being good boys with the first show being the next day.</p><p>So I went and hung out with them, ate, drank beer and played cards.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t technically working yesterday but just being with them all gave me a good initial insight into the dynamics between them all. The relationship the band has, especially with new addition of Smith for the tour.</p><p>It\u2019s funny, because even though Jake\u2019s the \u2018boss\u2019 it didn\u2019t come across that way with them. They all seem to have a great relationship. Watching them together, it was just like watching a bunch of guys in college. Even with Smith, there\u2019s no weirdness with him there, the way they act toward him, it seems like he\u2019s always been there.</p><p>But it did make me wonder what it was like when Jonny was still here.</p><p>It\u2019s clear that Denny is the sensible one, so I get the impression he\u2019s the one Jake can rely on for work. Tom\u2019s not unreliable, but the definite player I\u2019d say. The one always cracking jokes, the partier and clearly a womaniser.</p><p>Tom\u2019s eyes spent a lot of time on my boobs while I was there with them. It didn\u2019t bother me, but I got the clear impression it was bothering Jake. Mainly because he kept asking me if I was cold, and did I need to put a sweater on over my vest top.</p><p>Yeah sure Jake, it\u2019s a hundred degrees in here, of course I want to wear a sweater!</p><p>His behaviour, if anything just highlighted the big brother vibe I got earlier, when he made the comment about Smith being married.</p><p>Tom is well known, like Jake, for enjoying the \u2018female\u2019 perks of his profession.</p><p>I can imagine Tom is that kind of player who would work the room, flirting his way around. I think Jake is the kind of guy who waits for woman to come to him. He doesn\u2019t work for it. Then again, he doesn\u2019t need too.</p><p>Not that I\u2019ve seen any of this in action yet, but I\u2019m sure I will very soon. And honestly, I\u2019m not looking forward to seeing Jake with other women. The thought turns my stomach.</p><p>I didn\u2019t do any of the sightseeing I had intended to on my first day in Stockholm, and I probably won\u2019t today either as I\u2019m here with Jake and the guys at the stadium, and then it\u2019s the show tonight, then we leave first thing in the morning to go to Germany.</p><p>I get a feeling this is how things might be for the whole of the tour.</p><p>It\u2019s lunchtime, Jake\u2019s called a break from rehearsal and I\u2019m in one of the large dressing rooms with him and the guys, and a few other people from the tour, eating lunch.</p><p>I\u2019m sitting on the sofa, my notepad rested on the arm, and I\u2019m writing up some things, pulling together some of my notes from the rehearsals.</p><p>\u201cDid you get anything good from this morning\u2019s rehearsal for the book?\u201d Jake asks slumping down into the empty space next to me, indicating to my notebook.</p><p>He sits so close, a nervous energy suddenly takes reign under my skin.</p><p>\u201cA few things.\u201d I turn my head, smiling at him. \u201cIt was great watching you up there on stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe show tonight will be even better,\u201d he smiles confidently back at me.</p><p>He can be such an arrogant sod at times, but it\u2019s so alluring.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it will be.\u201d Then a thought pops into my head, remembering something he said to me back when I interviewed him, about that woman he\u2019d hired for the tour, who was going to make it amazing. He hasn\u2019t mentioned her since, and I haven\u2019t been introduced to many women on this tour. Jake seems to have a lot of men working for him, I feel quite outnumbered; it\u2019s a good job I get on better with men. Men, especially who are into music I can get on with no problem. Bitchy groupies looking to hook up with Jake, maybe not so much.</p><p>I wonder if that\u2019s a deliberate thing on his part, keeping it mainly to a male orientated tour, keeping the temptation from wanting to screw any of his staff away from him. Fucking the staff wouldn\u2019t make for a good working environment I\u2019d imagine.</p><p>\u201cSo when do I get to meet the mystery woman on this tour?\u201d I ask, crossing my legs.</p><p>Jake looks at me confused. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>I turn my body toward him slightly. \u201cWhen I interviewed you, you said you\u2019d hired some woman who was going to make this tour your most successful to date.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing her shoes, Tru.\u201d He glances down at my dangling foot.</p><p>I follow his stare, lifting my high heeled black studded ankle boot up a little higher.</p><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><p>He leans close, and his hot breath brushes over the skin on my neck tickling me, as he says, \u201cI was talking about you, Tru.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>I stay shock still as he leans back, assessing my face.</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t offer me this job, or well ... the magazine until the next day,\u201d I utter, finding my voice.</p><p>He grins. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how did you know I\u2019d take the job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause women never say no to me.\u201d With a wink, he gets up and wanders off over to the food table.</p><p>God, he\u2019s such a cocky, arrogant bastard at times. And I totally fancy him.</p><p>No I don\u2019t.</p><p>Yes, I do.</p><p>No. I. Don\u2019t.</p><p>Ah fuck.</p><p>I\u2019m at the side of the stage standing in the right wing with Stuart. The support band had finished a while ago, and now TMS are about to take the stage.</p><p>Jake walks slowly onto stage coming in from the left, with a confidence that only he can carry, with his guitar slung across his back.</p><p>He looks across at me, his eyes move over my clothes, my body, then they meet with mine and he grins.</p><p>I feel a blush rise in my cheeks. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s a little darker here where we\u2019re standing, so Stuart can\u2019t see what a girl I\u2019m being.</p><p>When Jake reaches the mike, he leans close, but then pauses, leaning back he surveys the crowd. This Jake has this way of looking around at everyone in the room, but making you feel like the only person he\u2019s actually looking at is you. That you are the object of his desire. You\u2019re the one he\u2019s taking home tonight. He can undress a woman with one look alone. And when his eyes meet and fix onto mine, I suddenly feel it and more, and it strips me naked to the core. My legs start to tremble.</p><p>Then his eyes drift away from mine.</p><p>\u201cSo I see we have Stockholm\u2019s finest in here tonight. Ladies you look beautiful tonight ... and guys, well hang on tight to your girls is all I\u2019m sayin\u2019,\u201d he releases a slow, chuckle. Moving back slightly, he looks at me, gives me a wink and a secret smile, then launches into one of their early hits. \u2018Undress You\u2019.</p><p>And boy do I feel undressed.</p><p>And I stand here experiencing the Jake Wethers experience in full 3D HD glory feeling exposed and naked, and good lord it\u2019s amazing.</p><p>I feel high.</p><p>On him.</p><p>His voice is like hands moving over my skin touching me. His hands. Touching me.</p><p>I want that now.</p><p>No I don\u2019t.</p><p>I mean it\u2019s just a reflex reaction to the rock star lover in me. The dream of wanting to be the one to tame him.</p><p>Of course it\u2019s not real.</p><p>Halfway through the show, Jake slows things down to a stop.</p><p>He swings his guitar to rest behind him and, lifts his hand to his head, running his fingers through his hair. \u201cI just wanted to pause for a minute to talk about Jonny...\u201d</p><p>A few fans cry out from the crowd, \u201cJonny we fuckin\u2019 love you!\u201d</p><p>I feel the hairs on my arms prickle. I can see how hard this is for Jake. And I think of him talking to me in bed last night about Jonny. How Jonny was his glue. That Jonny and me were so similar, and I wonder now if that\u2019s how he stills see me \u2013 as his strength. I get the sudden urge to want to hold him, run my fingers through his hair, kiss him and tell him everything will always be okay.</p><p>Jake bows his head, resting it against the mike.</p><p>My throat tightens, tears biting my eyes, as I worry that he\u2019s losing it again, here on stage.</p><p>Denny\u2019s over his drum-kit, jumping it in on swift move and he\u2019s at Jake\u2019s side instantly. He puts his hand on Jake\u2019s shoulder, and rests his forehead against Jake\u2019s head, speaking into his ear. Tom is there now too. I notice Smith, takes leave to the side of the stage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The stadium is at a standstill.</p><p>There is a golf ball the size of Africa formed in my throat. Tears welling in my eyes, as I watch these three men who I know, one of whom I love very much, still grieving over the loss of their best friend.</p><p>I glance at Stuart beside me. His eyes look glazed. It must have been hard on him too losing Jonny. I know he works for Jake, but he would have known him too.</p><p>Feeling overcome with emotion, I press my lips together and wrap my arms around myself, then look back out to the stage. Back to Jake.</p> <p>Jake lifts his head and clears his throat. \u201cI met Jonny at high-school. I\u2019d just moved to the States from the England, I was the new awkward British kid - a little lost and a lot lonely, and there he was. He took me under his wing and taught me to be his level of cool.\u201d He pulls in a deep breath. \u201cWe formed TMS, with just the two of us. Then at college we met Denny through one of Jonny\u2019s many girlfriends, and Denny introduced us to Tom, and that\u2019s when TMS was properly born.\u201d Another deep breath. Jake glances at Denny, then Tom. \u201cJonny wasn\u2019t just our band member,\u201d he says looking straight ahead. \u201cAnd he wasn\u2019t just our best friend ... or our wing-man. He was the mighty in our storm. The man was a fuckin\u2019 musical genius, and he was taken from us too soon. And we miss him every single fuckin\u2019 day.\u201d</p><p>Jake pulls his mike out from the stand and walks to the front of the stage, Tom and Denny following, as a runner hands him up three bottles of Jack.</p><p>He hands one each to Tom and Denny.</p><p>\u201cSo I want you to all raise your drinks for Jonny Creed - the best guy this world ever had the good fortune to know.\u201d Jake raises his bottle and looks up the sky. \u201cJonny man, we love you and we miss you every day, and I know for sure that you\u2019re looking down right now with a bottle in your hand, a cigarette in the other, saying, \u2018Quit being a set of pussies and give these good people the show they fuckin\u2019 paid to see!\u2019 \u201d</p><p>I see Tom and Denny smiling at Jake\u2019s words, nodding their agreement.</p> <p>Jake chinks bottles with them both, and the three of them, at the same time, throw the whiskey back.</p><p>The crowd is screaming out Jonny\u2019s name.</p><p>Men and women are openly crying in the audience. And I can\u2019t help the tear that runs from my eye.</p><p>I quickly wipe it away.</p><p>Jake returns back to the mike stand with his much lighter whiskey bottle. He fits his mike in the stand. Denny climbs back into his drum kit, Tom wandering back to his place on Jake\u2019s right hand side.</p><p>And for this moment, all three of them look a little lost, together.</p> <p>It makes my heart ache with love for Jake.</p><p>Jake leans down and puts his whiskey bottle by the mike stand.</p><p>I see Smith quietly reappear back on stage to Jake\u2019s left.</p><p>\u201cThis song we\u2019re playing next is one Jonny and I wrote in the early days. It was the one Jonny was most proud of ... his favourite, and I know how much it meant to him when we released it and you guys loved it too, when you took a chance on us ... it\u2019s one I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll all be familiar with, so I want you stretch your lungs out and sing this one with me \u2013 for Jonny.\u201d</p><p>Jake swings his guitar around to the front, bows his head looking down at his guitar as he strums a few chords, then Denny kicks the beat in and Jake lifts his head and starts to sing one of their early biggest hits, \u2018Hush, Baby\u2019.</p><p>I get goose bumps all over my skin. Listening as the crowd goes wild. And I stand here, transfixed singing along with the words, watching Jake. I can see how hard it is for him to get through this song, and I know he\u2019s thinking of Jonny the whole time.</p><p>I wish I had been there for him when Jonny died. I wasn\u2019t then, but I want to be every day from now on.</p><p>Jake and I will always be friends. No matter what. I\u2019m never losing him again.</p> <p>I\u2019m at the after show party which is being held at this upmarket club called the Spy Bar. It\u2019s packed to the rafters with showbiz like people from Sweden, and everyone who works on the tour.</p><p>I\u2019m glad I dressed nice for tonight as most of the women here are glamorous and classy. I went for something a little different though, well I always wear different, but I bought this matching navy blue pinstripe v-neck fitted waistcoat and straight leg cropped trousers just before I left for the tour. It was love at first sight and I just had to have them. I\u2019ve teamed it with my skyscraper patent black heels. I know most of the woman here are in dresses, but I like to be a little different, and technically I am working, so it\u2019s like I\u2019m wearing work clothes.</p><p>I\u2019m at the bar with a couple of the roadies Pete and Gary who I was chatting to earlier, drinking a margarita.</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen Jake since the show. He had some interviews to do straight after, so when he exited stage he was swept off by Stuart.</p><p>I was going to hang around and wait for him but Pete came over and said they were heading straight for the party, and did I want to catch a ride with them; normally the roadies have to stay on and pack up after the show, but Jake, being the good boss he is, lets them pack up in the morning so they can enjoy the party with everyone else. So of course I accepted, better than hanging around the stadium like a spare part.</p><p>\u201cSo how long have you worked for Jake?\u201d I ask Pete. Gary is busily chatting to one of the other roadies, Jared I think his name is.</p><p>Pete\u2019s a cute guy, short dark hair, about six foot, quite muscular, must be from all the heavy lifting he does on tour.</p><p>\u201cFive years on and off,\u201d he replies in his strong American accent, leaning back against the bar, resting his elbows on it.</p><p>A lot of bands have crews for abroad when they tour, but Jake has a set group of guys he trusts that tour everywhere with him.</p><p>\u201cYou must have seen a lot of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few places,\u201d he grins. \u201cIt\u2019s a good gig working for these guys ... so how did you land up here?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cOh, I er ...\u201d I\u2019m just about to reply, when I see Pete\u2019s eyes flick up, and I instantly feel Jake\u2019s presence behind me.</p><p>Turning, I almost come face to face with him, he\u2019s that close.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say beaming.</p><p>\u201cHey, beautiful.\u201d He kisses my cheek, and rests his hand on my waist and stares across at Pete.</p><p>I feel a little heady under his touch.</p><p>\u201cYou want a drink, Jake?\u201d Pete asks.</p><p>\u201cBeer,\u201d he replies. His tone is stony.</p><p>Pete turns to the bar to order Jake\u2019s drink for him.</p><p>Sliding out of Jake\u2019s arm, I retrieve my margarita from the bar, feeling a little annoyed by his big brother attitude again.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t leave your drink unattended like that,\u201d he comments. \u201cAnyone could slip something in it.\u201d</p><p>I glance down at my drink, then back up at him. \u201cYou saying your staff are untrustworthy?\u201d I grin over my glass at him, as I take a sip.</p><p>He shakes his head, slowly at me, eyes gripping mine.</p><p>\u201cYou forget your shirt tonight?\u201d He gestures at my bare arms, and waistcoat.</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d I roll my eyes at him. Then pouting, I say, \u201cYou don\u2019t like my outfit?\u201d</p><p>He moistens his lips with his tongue. \u201cNo, I do, it\u2019s really nice.\u201d His eyes flicker to my boobs, then back to my face; I don\u2019t miss that. \u201cI just happen to know every other guy in this place is gonna think so too, and I\u2019m gonna spend most of tonight kicking their asses.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, I shake my head. \u201cYou can quit with the big brother act, Jake. We\u2019re not kids anymore. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>He presses his lips together, grinning. \u201cBig brother act?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, the whole \u2018hands off Tru she\u2019s got a boyfriend\u2019 thing you keep doing. I\u2019m pretty much the only girl on tour here and if you scare off every guy who talks to me, I\u2019ll only be left with you to talk with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuits me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake!\u201d I exclaim, feeling quick to exasperation. \u201cI\u2019m not a bed hopper you know. I\u2019m not going to sleep with all these guys just because I talk to them. I\u2019m not going to cheat on Will, it\u2019d just be nice to have people to talk to when you\u2019re not around.\u201d</p><p>And it\u2019s kind of annoying, and hurtful that he thinks I am to be honest.</p><p>His brow furrows. \u201cI know you\u2019re not a bed hopper, Tru. I\u2019m just taking care of my best friend, it\u2019s written in the rules if I remember correctly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re version of them or mine?\u201d I grin. I can\u2019t stay mad with him for long.</p><p>He presses his lips together again, supressing his own grin. \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>Pete hands Jake his beer.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he says, taking the beer from him, but not taking his eyes off mine.</p><p>\u201cCome and sit with me,\u201d Jake says holding out his hand for me to take.</p><p>I stare into his eyes for a long moment. \u201cOkay.\u201d I take his hand. \u201cSee you guys later,\u201d I say to Pete and Gary.</p><p>Jake leads me over to a booth already filled with Tom, Denny, Smith, Stuart. I can see a group of girls hanging nearby, and I feel the hard stares I earn from them because Jake is holding my hand.</p><p>It makes me feel a little uncomfortable.</p><p>Jake ushers me in the booth first, next to Denny, and sits beside me trapping me in. I put my drink down on the table and my bag on the floor beside my feet.</p><p>\u201cYou enjoy the show?\u201d Denny asks me.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d I smile. \u201cIt was amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking very beautiful tonight, Tru,\u201d Tom smiles across the table at me.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I flush feeling a little shy.</p><p>I don\u2019t know want it is about Tom, but he has this ability to make me feel like I\u2019m a sixteen year old girl. I think he has that effect on most women. And I don\u2019t even fancy him, it\u2019s so totally weird. Maybe it\u2019s his patter that does it. It always feels like there\u2019s a hidden agenda behind what he\u2019s saying.</p><p>A lot like Jake in that respect. But I get the impression Tom\u2019s hidden meaning when directed at me is a lot dirtier than Jake\u2019s.</p><p>Jake shifts around in his seat, pressing his leg up against mine and puts his arm around the back of the seat behind me.</p><p>I see Tom\u2019s eyes flicker in his direction, and he grins.</p><p>Big brother Jake is back, and I get the distinct feeling that Tom is enjoying winding him up with me.</p><p>\u201cWell you assholes are boring the shit out of me, barring you of course Tru.\u201d Tom flashes a toothy smile at me again as he climbs out of the booth, stepping over Smith, jumping to the floor. \u201cI\u2019m off to go pick a skirt up for the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there ever a time when you\u2019re not horny?\u201d Stuart asks him.</p><p>Tom looks at him like this is the most ridiculous question he\u2019s ever been asked.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he grins. \u201cI\u2019m like a horny Tom cat, always on the prowl for new pussy.\u201d</p><p>Jake splutters out a laugh. I have to hold one back myself.</p><p>\u201cDid you actually just refer to yourself as a Tom cat?\u201d Jake asks, still laughing.</p><p>\u201cHell yeah! And don\u2019t you go all prim on me, ass-face, because I know for a fact you\u2019ve referred to your dick as a snake on many occasion.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stuarts snorts his drink up his nose, and starts choking.</p><p>I feel Jake tense beside me.

Though talking about Jake and his snake is making me feel a little lightheaded. I wonder how big it actually is? I\u2019m tempted to cast my gaze downwards at his crotch, but I hold of the urge, pinning my eyes up front and ahead.</p><p>\u201cHey, thinking about this,\u201d Toms adds, leaning his groin up against our table. \u201cI\u2019m feeling a theme coming on here, we\u2019ve got, of course, me - hunky fuckin\u2019 Tom cat, Jake the snake there ... now we just need to figure something up for you three fuckers.\u201d He gestures to Denny, Stuart and Smith.</p> <p>Denny lifts his head. \u201cNo fuckin\u2019 way man, leave me out of your weird animal fantasies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh shut up you miserable fucker! Denny? What rhymes with Denny?\u201d he muses. \u201cAh man your name is shit! Nothing rhymes with it. We\u2019re gonna have to change it.\u201d</p><p>Denny climbs up over Stuart, then Smith, and jumps lithely to the floor. \u201cRemind me why I\u2019m friends with you again?\u201d he asks Tom, patting his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m fuckin\u2019 awesome and I can get chicks to play with your dick.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but snort a laugh out at that one.</p><p>Jake slides me an amused glance. But all it manages to do is tighten my stomach into knots, and then I have the sudden urge to want to touch him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m off to piss,\u201d Denny laughs, shaking his head at Tom, he wanders off in the direction of the men\u2019s room</p><p>\u201cYou coming to pick up some skirts, dickhead?\u201d Tom says directing a look at Jake, already sounding like it\u2019s a given he\u2019ll go.</p><p>I instantly tense. I don\u2019t want Jake going to pick girls up. The thought is curdling my insides.</p><p>Jake shakes his head, taking a drink of his beer. \u201cNo, I\u2019m good here.\u201d</p><p>Tom looks at him like he\u2019s grown another head. Even Stuart gives him a surprised stare.</p><p>I relax in my seat.</p><p>\u201cDid they amputate your dick while you were in rehab? Or has Stuart finally managed to turn you?\u201d Tom asks, laughing.</p><p>Turn him? Is Stuart gay?</p> <p>It must be the expression on my face which causes Stuart to lean over to me and say, \u201cI\u2019m gay, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh right,\u201d I nod.</p><p>Makes sense. He\u2019s ridiculously beautiful and has the best taste in clothes.</p><p>Jake laughs, reaching forward he puts his beer down. \u201cNo, and no,\u201d he says answering Tom. \u201cI\u2019ve told you, I don\u2019t fuck the staff.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m \u2018the staff\u2019. So he won\u2019t be fucking me then.</p><p>Thank God of course that he won\u2019t be trying it on with me. I know he wouldn\u2019t anyway because he doesn\u2019t see me that way, but it\u2019s just good to know Jake doesn\u2019t have sex with the few women who work for him. Just everyone else of course.</p><p>Stuart snorts loudly.</p><p>Jake leans forward, looking at him with interest.</p><p>\u201cChloe?\u201d Stuart raises his eyebrow.</p><p>Jake screws his face up in thought, quickly shifting to remembrance. \u201cAh yeah, okay ... so I don\u2019t fuck the staff anymore.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so he did used to screw the staff.</p><p>I suddenly feel uncomfortable and a little sick listening to this conversation.</p><p>This is the Jake I read about in the papers. I don\u2019t want to hear about this Jake.</p><p>\u201cCan you let me out?\u201d I say to him.</p><p>\u201cSure. Where you off to?\u201d he asks, sliding out of the booth, letting me out onto my wobbly legs.</p><p>\u201cBathroom,\u201d I answer, keeping my tone even.</p><p>I walk away heading for the ladies, trying to ignore the stares from his waiting groupies, and from Jake himself.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>We\u2019re in Barcelona. The show is tomorrow night at the Estadi Ol\u00edmpic Llu\u00eds Companys stadium.</p><p>My folks are arriving first thing in the morning. I\u2019m so excited to see them.</p><p>Jake was all for it when I mentioned about getting them tickets for coming over here to see the show. I think he\u2019s looking forward to seeing my dad again.</p><p>I\u2019ve been touring with TMS for almost two weeks now, and the time has just absolutely flown by. I\u2019ve barely had time to think let alone miss anyone, I\u2019m with Jake pretty much all the time, but it will be so good to see my folks tomorrow.</p><p>And I\u2019m looking forward to seeing Will in a week. I\u2019ve spent time away from him before of course, but I think with my folks coming tomorrow it\u2019s made me a little sick for home. For him.</p><p>I lift my bracelet up looking at it, dangling it in the light.</p><p>Picking my phone up, I decide to call him.</p><p>\u201cHey, gorgeous,\u201d he murmurs down the phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat you up too?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWorking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this time? It\u2019s... eight forty five there, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s that big acquisition I told you about, well some shit kicked off with it, and there\u2019s an emergency meeting first thing in the morning, so I have to prepare a load of stuff for it. Good thing is it\u2019s keeping me busy, stopping me dwelling on how much I\u2019m missing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you too,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do silly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re at work...\u201d I say putting a sultry tone on.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re in your suit?\u201d I love Will in his suits. He looks really hot wearing them.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in the office alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mark\u2019s working late too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, feeling a little deflated. I was up for some dirty phone talk. Not like me at all, but I\u2019m feeling pretty horny at the moment.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cLying on my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Shame you\u2019re not alone, I was gonna ... maybe ... uh, talk dirty things with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you when I\u2019m home.\u201d His breathing suddenly sounds short.</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouple of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting ... and naked,\u201d I add, grinning to myself, feeling all confident.</p><p>\u201cTwo hours,\u201d he confirms, voice husky.</p><p>\u201cNot a minute more. I love you,\u201d I add.</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d</p><p>I hang the phone up with Will feeling restless and now have two hours to kill before I can talk dirty with my boyfriend.</p><p>Not exactly sex, but the closest thing I\u2019m going to get to it with him for another week.</p><p>Realising I haven\u2019t eaten dinner yet, I decide to go see Jake, see if he wants to have dinner with me. I hope he hasn\u2019t already eaten. I hate eating alone.</p><p>I knock at his suite door, and Stuart answers a few moments later.</p><p>He looks all dressed up to the nines. Stuart always looks smart, but tonight, he\u2019s looks foxy. Like he\u2019s dressed for a date.</p><p>\u201cWell look at you,\u201d I say suggestively. \u201cSomeone got a date by any chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner with an old friend, chica,\u201d he winks. \u201cJake\u2019s in the living room.\u201d He passes me heading out the door.</p><p>\u201cHave a good night,\u201d I grin.</p><p>\u201cOh, I will,\u201d he says, walking backwards, grinning, he turns and strides off down the hall.</p><p>Looks like someone\u2019s getting laid tonight.</p><p>I sigh.</p><p>Closing the door behind me, into the silence of the suite, I hear Jake strumming lightly on his guitar.</p><p>The sound makes the hairs on my arms prickle. I stand for a moment listening as Jake starts to sing, Chris Isaak\u2019s, \u2018Wicked Game\u2019.</p><p>He sounds stunning.</p><p>On quiet feet, I walk down the hall. Rounding the corner, I pause, leaning against it, watching him.</p><p>His eyes are closed. He\u2019s lost in the song. And he looks beautiful.</p><p>My hands are suddenly desperate to touch him. I want to smooth my fingers over his lips, his face, up into his hair.</p><p>I want to kiss him so very badly in this moment.</p><p>I have a flashback to young Jake, sat in my parent\u2019s living room playing the guitar for me. I remember how my tummy used to feel funny when I would listen to him play, even back then. I had no concept of those feelings, what they meant.</p><p>Love. It was love for him.</p><p>And I\u2019m getting that very same feeling in my stomach again. But more intense now.</p><p>Jake\u2019s eyes open, meeting straight with mine. His gaze burns into me and I feel naked to him. Like he can read my thoughts in this moment.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t break from a note singing.</p><p>Keeping my eyes locked on his I walk toward him, my body erupting with trembles, ricocheting from the inside out, as Jake sings to me.</p><p>Sitting down on the edge of the coffee table just across from him, I\u2019m entranced.</p><p>And in this moment I want him.</p><p>I know it\u2019s just because I haven\u2019t had sex for a while, and talking to Will on the phone just got me all horny.</p><p>And I know this is what Jake does. He has this amazing ability to draw you into him the instant he opens his mouth and starts to sing. His voice is so insanely beautiful. It\u2019s all just so natural to him.</p><p>That\u2019s why he\u2019s so adored, loved by the world. And why women want him.</p><p>This song is stunning, and not easy to sing at all, but Jake does, and effortlessly.</p><p>In this moment I realise how lucky I am to be sitting here with him, listening to him sing like this. Most people would sell their soul to be where I am right now.</p><p>Finishing the last note, Jake smiles at me.</p><p>I feel like my whole body is on fire, and my brain too.</p><p>\u201cThat was amazing,\u201d I say, feeling a little out of breath.</p><p>He shrugs lightly, and puts his guitar down. I hate it when he dismisses himself like that.</p><p>\u201cSo your folks get here in the morning?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cThey do,\u201d I beam.</p><p>\u201cWhat time does their flight land?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to get Dave to pick them up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI want to meet them at the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to drive you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrive a car? Surprisingly, yes,\u201d he chuckles.</p><p>\u201cShut up, idiot,\u201d I giggle. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, and of course I can.\u201d He gives me an earnest look. \u201cI\u2019ll have to stay in the car while you go into the airport though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I run my fingertip over the table. \u201cAnd, yes, I would love you to drive me to the airport. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Looking up, I meet his eye. We stare at one another for a long moment. My mouth dries.</p><p>Running my tongue around my mouth, I say, \u201cSo I, uh, came to see if you haven\u2019t had dinner already, did you want to eat with me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t eaten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. So what do you fancy \u2013 in or out?\u201d</p><p>His eyes linger on mine again. A shiver erupts deep inside me.</p><p>\u201cIn,\u201d he finally says. His voice sounds a little gruff, I notice. \u201cWe can order up room service and watch TV.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds perfect,\u201d I smile, as Jake reaches for the TV remote handing it to me, he picks up the room service menu and I climb onto the sofa beside him.</p><p>It\u2019s 7am and I\u2019m in the car with Jake going to the airport to collect my folks. I\u2019m practically bouncing around in my seat with excitement. It\u2019s been nearly two months since I last saw them.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019ve got ants in your pants,\u201d Jake chuckles.</p><p>\u201cSorry! I\u2019m just really looking forward to seeing them,\u201d I beam. \u201cAnd my dad is gonna be so stoked to see that you\u2019ve come to pick them up with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be,\u201d he slides me an amused glance.</p> <p>\u201cYes he will. He always thought of you as the son he never had and I know he\u2019s looking forward to seeing you again.\u201d</p><p>Stopping at the lights, Jake looks across at me. This look intense, meaningful. \u201cBilly didn\u2019t need a son, Tru. He got everything in you.\u201d</p><p>I gulp down.</p><p>\u201cBut he was the closest thing I ever had to a dad,\u201d he adds.</p><p>Without thinking, I reach over and caress his cheek lovingly.</p><p>Jake looks at me surprised, instantly tensing under my touch.</p> <p>Coming to, I take my hand back, my cheeks heating. I sit face forward. My heart is pumping hard in my chest.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I just did that.</p><p>We\u2019re silent for a moment. And I\u2019m sitting here squirming in my seat at the act of intimacy I just showed to Jake.</p><p>\u201cTru...,\u201d he begins, voice soft.</p><p>A horn beeps behind us making me jump, and I look up to see the light is on green. Jake shifts the car into drive, never finishing his sentence.</p><p>Jake pulls the car up into a waiting bay outside the airport, and I climb out to go and meet my folks.</p><p>Walking into the airport, I check the board for arrivals. Seeing their flight has already landed, I head straight over to the arrivals gate.</p><p>I\u2019m only waiting five minutes when I see the familiar faces of my mum and dad.</p> <p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d I cry out, jogging over to him, I launch myself into his arms.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby girl.\u201d He squeezes me tightly.</p><p>I feel a sudden lump in my throat, and tears in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cMama,\u201d I smile hugging her.</p><p>\u201cMy beautiful girl,\u201d she says taking my face into her hands, she kisses my cheek. \u201cYou look well ... happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am happy, because you both are here.\u201d I put my arm through hers; resting my head against her shoulder we start to walk, following my dad pulling their case along.</p><p>\u201cThe car is just over there, dad.\u201d I point to the left at Jake\u2019s rented Mercedes.</p><p>My dad turns back, eyebrow raised. \u201cYou\u2019re driving a Merc?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me silly,\u201d I giggle. \u201cI got a ride here.\u201d</p><p>I was going to tell them Jake was in the car, but I think it will be a nice surprise for my dad when he sees him.</p><p>We approach the car and I pop the boot. My dad lifts the suitcase into it.</p><p>My dad goes for the backseat door, but I say, \u201cSit up front. I\u2019ll sit in the back with mama.\u201d</p><p>Giving me a funny look, he opens the door and climbs in, and I get in the backseat with my mum.</p><p>\u201cHey, Billy,\u201d Jake says to him.</p><p>\u201cJake, my boy!\u201d my dad exclaims and pulls Jake in a manly hug.</p><p>Jake looks a little taken aback, but really he shouldn\u2019t be surprised, my dad has always been a huggy kind of guy.</p><p>Jake looks back at us. \u201cHi, Eva,\u201d he says to my mum. He sounds nervous.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jake,\u201d she nods, smiling lightly.</p><p>I can tell he\u2019s wary with my mum.</p><p>She\u2019s a no nonsense kind of person, says it how she sees it, and I know he\u2019s worried what she will think of his antics over the years.</p><p>Funny, he\u2019s this rich, famous man, but my mum can make him feel like a misbehaving teenager again.</p><p>As we travel back, my dad talks away in the front with Jake, of course about the show tonight, and I talk with my mum about what I\u2019ve been doing since I came on the tour.</p><p>When we get back to the hotel, Jake has to go, as he needs to head over to the stadium to prepare for tonight\u2019s show. So I get my mum and dad settled in their suite.</p><p>They\u2019re staying in Stuart\u2019s suite, and he\u2019s moved into Jake\u2019s for the two days that they are here.</p><p>The hotel didn\u2019t have any other available suites, and Jake wouldn\u2019t have my mum and dad staying in just any old room, which was sweet. I offered to give mine up for them, but he wouldn\u2019t have that either, then Stuart said he would crash in Jake\u2019s suite, as it\u2019s got two bedrooms anyway, and he\u2019d let my parents stay in his suite, which Jake agreed to.</p><p>Once they\u2019re all settled, we head down to have breakfast together in the hotel. While we\u2019re eating Jake calls me on my phone and asks if my dad would like to go down to the stadium to watch rehearsals.</p><p>My dad\u2019s face nearly splits in two when I relay it to him.</p><p>One glance at my mum and she nods her ascent, so my dad heartily agrees. He will be in his absolute element there with the guys.</p><p>Jake tells me he\u2019s going to send Dave to come and pick dad up in thirty minutes, so we finish up our breakfast, and Dave turns up as expected for my dad.</p><p>Kissing both me and mum, dad heads off to the stadium.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you want to do today, mama?\u201d I ask. \u201cGo to the beach or shopping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShopping,\u201d she grins.</p><p>We get our bags from our suites, then head out into Barcelona for the day.</p><p>I love shopping with my mum. She has a really eclectic taste in clothes, that\u2019s where I get my fashion sense from.</p><p>We stumble across this little boutique that sells the most amazing clothes and shoes. And I instantly zone on these Black colour block high heeled, strappy sandals, with white and orange bars going across the toe area.</p><p>I buy them, and a black and orange two in one waisted prom dress with asymmetric straps to go with my beautiful new shoes.</p><p>I decide not to wear them tonight as it\u2019s really hot in Barcelona today, and it will be even hotter at the stadium tonight so I buy a cute little strappy, black and white feather print playsuit. It has this gorgeous pink fabric belt, which will go perfectly with my pink kitten heels I have back at the hotel.</p><p>My mum buys quite a few items as well, and insists on paying for my things too. I protest, but not for too long, as I am squeezing on the old Visa a lot nowadays.</p><p>We are out most of the day shopping, and arrive back loaded with bags. I leave my mum at her suite and head to mine to call Will, as I haven\u2019t spoke to him all day.</p><p>I\u2019m just finishing up on the phone with him, when there\u2019s a knock at my door.</p><p>I answer it to a happy looking Jake.</p><p>\u201cHey, beautiful,\u201d he says kissing my cheek, he walks into my room.</p><p>\u201cHey, yourself,\u201d I say closing the door, still coming down from his kiss. \u201cYou had a good day?\u201d</p><p>He nods, smiling, sitting on the arm of the sofa. \u201cYep, your dad came up with these ideas for tonight\u2019s show, some riffs ... ah they work perfect, Tru. I forgot how fuckin\u2019 awesome that man is with a guitar in his hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s kind of awesome all the time,\u201d I say smiling at his enthusiasm, sitting on the seat opposite him, I tuck my legs under my bum.</p><p>\u201cYou had a good day?\u201d He indicates to my pile of shopping bags.</p><p>\u201cYep, mama took me shopping,\u201d I grin.</p><p>\u201cAny sexy underwear in there?\u201d He lifts his chin in the direction of my bags.</p><p>I shake my head, rolling my eyes at him. \u201cBig brother one minute, perv the next,\u201d I chuckle.</p><p>He laughs, getting to his feet. \u201cOkay, well I just came to tell you we\u2019re going out for an early dinner tonight with your folks, so you\u2019ve got half an hour to get ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are?\u201d I say getting to my feet following him to the door. \u201cAnd who\u2019s idea was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine of course,\u201d he smiles, then giving me another swift kiss on the cheek, he\u2019s gone.</p><p>I get a quick shower, not washing my hair, I decide to tie it up off my neck because of the heat, so I put it up into a loose chignon, leaving some loose strand around my face. I put my new playsuit on with my little heels, a spritz of Chanel and I\u2019m out the door, heading to my mum and dad\u2019s suite.</p><p>Jake\u2019s already there when I arrive, so we all head out to dinner, with Dave driving us.</p><p>Jake\u2019s reserved a table at a swanky restaurant called Arola, which is situated on the second floor of the equally swanky Hotel Arts.</p><p>The waiter shows us to a table out on the terrace. The restaurant is beautiful, very modern and very expensive looking. It has these billowing sail like shades, fitted out above each table, to shade the fading Spanish sun.</p><p>Dinner is awesome, my dad is in top form, talking away about the rehearsals today, and how awesome a musician Jake is. Jake is naturally embarrassed and waves his compliments off.</p><p>But my dad is having none of it. He is totally in his element talking music. I love seeing my dad like this.</p><p>After dinner is done, and Jake and my dad argue about who will pay the bill; Jake wins of course on the press that they are there as his guests, Dave drives us straight to the stadium for the show.</p><p>Leaving Jake backstage, we head out to our seats up front.</p><p>The show is, as expected, amazing, and I have the best time here with my mum and dad. It\u2019s so great being here with them, watching Jake. It makes me feel a little nostalgic.</p><p>After the show is done, we three head backstage to meet back up with Jake. There\u2019s no big after show party tonight, the guys have just hired out of the VIP area in Barcelona\u2019s most exclusive club, Elephant. There is just the band, some of the roadie staff, and me and my mum and dad here. Stuart hasn\u2019t come tonight, he said he had some work to tend to after the show so he headed straight back to the hotel.</p><p>Jake\u2019s hardly left my side since we arrived. And I know it\u2019s a weird thing to say, but it almost feels like we\u2019re a couple tonight, the way he\u2019s being so attentive to me, even though we are clearly not and never will be. I know Jake doesn\u2019t see me that way, his reaction to me touching his face, amongst other things proved that to me. And of course I\u2019m with Will.</p><p>Jake leaves our table to go to the bathroom, leaving me and mum alone. My dad is over at the bar talking to Smith and Denny.</p><p>\u201cThat boy has got feelings for you,\u201d my mum says nodding in the direction of Jakes retreating back.</p><p>\u201cNo, \u00e9l no tiene. No seas tonto, mama,\u201d I say speaking in Spanish to her.</p><p>I said, \u2018No, he hasn't. Don't be silly, mama.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m taking in Spanish to her as I don\u2019t want this conversation to be aired in English.</p><p>Speaking back in Spanish, she says, \u201cHe has. I\u2019ve been watching him, watching you all night. Jake has barely taken his eyes off you. He clearly has feelings for you, but then he did when he was younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t,\u201d I brush her off. \u201cAnd he hasn\u2019t now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t mention the fact that Jake inadvertently knocked me back in London when I invited him in my flat for coffee that time.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, sweetheart. But I know what I see, and I see that boy wants you. Men like Jake can be very hard to say no to. I married your father, remember,\u201d she smiles, winking at me. \u201cYou love Will, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo promise me you\u2019ll be careful with Jake. You have a gentle heart my darling, and I don\u2019t want you to get hurt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay mama, I promise,\u201d I sigh picking my drink up and taking a sip.</p><p>Jake returns back to our table a few minutes later, but I feel on edge around him now after what my mum just said.</p><p>I don\u2019t think she is right about Jake wanting me, but all she has done is remind me of my own growing feelings for him. Or as I should say reignited ones.</p><p>We don\u2019t stay too late at the club, and leave at midnight, my mum and dad being tired after their plane journey and long day.</p><p>Dave takes us back to the hotel, and Jake decides to come too, leaving the rest of them at the club.</p> <p>I kiss my mum and dad goodnight at their door, agreeing to meet at nine am for breakfast.</p><p>Jake walks me to my suite.</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna come in and have a drink?\u201d I ask him, getting my key card out of my bag.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he says. \u201cActually come to mine, we can sit out on the balcony. Stuart will be in bed by now.\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s suite is the only one with a terraced balcony.</p><p>Agreeing, I follow Jake to his suite.</p> <p>He pauses outside his door. Turning to face me, he tucks a few strays strands of hair behind my ear.</p><p>\u201cI had a great day today, but an even better night with you. This whole tour has been amazing so far ... having you here, Tru. It\u2019s ... just like old times.\u201d</p><p>My heart starts to beat rapidly in my chest, and my face heats under his unwavering gaze.</p><p>Forcing a clumsy smile onto my lips, I say, \u201cIt has. I\u2019m really enjoying it.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me for a moment longer. Trembles erupt deep in my belly. And for a stupid moment, I actually wonder if he\u2019s going to kiss me.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get that drink.\u201d He breaks our gaze, and pushes his key card into the slot, opening the door.</p><p>All the lights are still on inside, and we find Stuart watching TV in the living room.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still up,\u201d Jake says to Stuart. His tone is surprisingly frosty.</p> <p>Stuart\u2019s eyes flicker between Jake and I, and I read clearly in them what he thinks I\u2019m here for.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be back until later.\u201d Stuart switches the TV off and gets to his feet. \u201cI was heading to bed in a minute any way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just came back for a drink,\u201d I pipe up. God that sounds even worse now I\u2019ve said it. Like I\u2019m covering something up, which blatantly wasn\u2019t going to happen. \u201cStay, have a drink with us.\u201d</p><p>Stuart\u2019s eyes flicker to Jake then back to me. \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just gonna hit the sack.\u201d He steps back.</p><p>\u201cCome on...\u201d I coax, smiling.</p><p>He looks at Jake again, then says, \u201cOkay. Just one drink.\u201d</p><p>I ignore Jake\u2019s obvious sigh from beside me.</p><p>What\u2019s his problem all of a sudden? He gets on really well with Stuart, so why doesn\u2019t he want him here for a drink?</p><p>\u2018Because mama was right,\u2019 says a little voice in my head.</p><p>No, of course she wasn\u2019t. I brush the thought to the back of my mind.</p><p>Jake\u2019s just being a snarky bastard for whatever reason.</p><p>Stuarts grabs a handful of the mini spirit out of the little fridge. I love these tiny bottles. Helping, I get some cans of mixers, and three glasses.</p><p>Jake is already out on the terrace having a smoke when we get out there.</p><p>Stuart and I put our little drink collection down on to the table.</p><p>I opt for a vodka and soda. Stuart has the same as me, and I pour out Jake a neat whiskey.</p><p>Jake takes the seat on my left. His knee bumps with mine under the table, but he doesn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>He seems a little irked to be honest, and I can\u2019t figure out what happened to make him change from the sweet Jake just outside the door of the suite, to grumpy Jake now.</p><p>He picks his whiskey up and takes a drink, then puts it down and taps his fingers on the metal table.</p><p>The atmosphere feels a little uncomfortable.</p><p>I\u2019m racking my brain trying to think of something to talk about, but coming up dry, so I almost heave out a sigh of relief when Stuart asks me, \u201cSo where is that beautiful mother of yours originally from, Tru?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPuerto Rico,\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cSo can you speak Spanish?\u201d Stuart inquires.</p><p>\u201cI can,\u201d I nod.</p><p>\u201cSo you know Spanish swear words.\u201d An impish grin crosses Stuart\u2019s lovely face.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cOoh, teach me some,\u201d he leans close to me, eager.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d Jake snips.</p><p>\u201cOld enough to kick your ass, you miserable bastard.\u201d Stuart winks at me. \u201cGo on Tru, say, \u2018asshole\u2019 in Spanish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGilipollas,\u201d I grin.</p><p>\u201cGilipollas,\u201d Stuart tries to imitate.</p><p>Jake throws his drink back and pours himself another out.</p><p>\u201cOkay, how do you say, fuck?\u201d</p><p>Jake shifts in his seat, then picks his cigarettes up, lighting on.</p><p>\u201cJoder.\u201d I take a sip of my drink, soothing my dry mouth.</p><p>\u201cJoder,\u201d Stuart copies. He\u2019s doing quite well with the accent for a beginner.</p><p>\u201cSo how would you say, \u2018fuck off asshole\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVete a la mierda gilipollas.\u201d</p><p>Jake takes a long drag of his cigarette, and the smoke billows past me.</p><p>I let out a light cough.</p><p>\u201cFuck that\u2019s a hard one!\u201d Stuart laughs. \u201cSay it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVete ... a la ... mierda .... gilipollas,\u201d I say slower.</p><p>Jake stubs his half-smoked cigarette out in the ashtray, and abruptly gets to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m off to bed. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d He strides away into the suite.</p><p>I look across at Stuart, confused. He lifts his eyebrows at me, shrugging.</p><p>I stay with Stuart for another ten minutes, finishing my drink, teaching him how to swear in Spanish, then I make an excuse about being tired, and head to my own suite.</p><p>I\u2019m not tired at all, just confused as to Jake\u2019s bad mood, unable to shake the feeling that for some reason, it\u2019s me that he\u2019s angry with.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>I\u2019m sitting in the small audience at a TV studio in Copenhagen.</p><p>TMS are doing an unplugged show for a division of MTV which will be aired worldwide in a few days.</p><p>Everyone in the audience is a competition winner. The competition was put out by the station a few weeks back, so to win a ticket to see them perform like this is a big deal.</p><p>I\u2019m lucky enough to be here because I know the band. Because I know Jake. And I\u2019m also here to work too. But that aside, I don\u2019t discount how very fortunate I am to be here.</p><p>The set is an hour long, and the guys are half-an hour in, playing acoustic mainly. Denny is off the drums, and is playing keyboard tonight. I didn\u2019t even know he could play until now.</p><p>Jake is sitting on a stool, microphone in front of him, playing acoustic guitar, and Tom is playing rhythm. Smith\u2019s not playing this show tonight.</p><p>Jake finishes up singing, \u2018Microscopic\u2019 another song off the \u2018Creed\u2019 album. The audience clap.</p><p>Jake pauses, lightly strumming his fingers over the strings, he breathes into the mic.</p><p>\u201cOkay so I\u2019m going back to song from our first ever album now. A good friend of mine told me that it\u2019s her favourite of all the songs I\u2019ve ever wrote, so tonight, I\u2019m dedicating it to her.\u201d He looks straight at me. \u201cTrudy Bennett this one\u2019s for you.\u201d</p><p>I gulp down.</p><p>Me? He\u2019s singing a song for me.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>I suddenly feel a little breathless. Then when he starts to sing \u2018Through It All\u2019, those hauntingly beautiful lyrics he once wrote, strumming his guitar, my heart starts to drum pure feeling in my chest.</p><p>And I feel a heavy mixture of emotions stream through me.</p><p>It is pin drop silent in here and I am spellbound to him.</p><p>I\u2019m not the only one. Everyone in this room is eyes on Jake, and it\u2019s in this exact moment, I truly see just to the level of power he has over people.</p><p>Mostly, over me.</p><p>I\u2019m so totally mesmerised by him.</p><p>And so totally in lust with him.</p><p>And so totally screwed.</p><p>I have my notebook with me in my hand ready to make notes, but I can\u2019t move. I can\u2019t do anything except breathe.</p><p>Even when he finishes up the song, I\u2019m still immobile.</p><p>And for the next half hour of the show, all I can do is watch Jake sing</p><p>Watching as he makes every single woman in this room feel like he\u2019s singing to her, that tonight she is the one he is taking home. She\u2019s the one he\u2019s going to share his bed with tonight.</p><p>And in this moment all I want, more than anything, is to be the one he chooses.</p><p>We stay backstage after the show and have some drinks with the staff. The talk is business, mostly about when the recording of the show will go out, and how they felt it went. The general consensus is everyone is really happy, but in all honesty, I\u2019m barely listening.</p><p>Jake is entrancing tonight, more so than normal. And I\u2019m struggling to keep my eyes off him. Something has changed since the show. There\u2019s an almost physical charge there, flowing out of me and heat seeking onto him like a bloody missile.</p><p>So evident and tangible I\u2019m sure people must be able to see it. I\u2019m kind of worried he can.</p><p>I don\u2019t know maybe it\u2019s always been there, but now, it\u2019s heightened somehow for some unknown reason. So I\u2019m keeping my distance from him, staying in the safe zone for as long as I can, until this thing, whatever it is, goes or dies down at the very least.</p><p>Because right now I want Jake.</p><p>I just need to keep repeating my Will mantra.</p><p>I love Will. I love Will. I love Will.</p><p>Jake\u2019s still on a high from the show, all the guys are for that matter. Maybe it\u2019s something about smaller intimate shows and the live recording for TV that buzzes them, but they are happy, buoyant, and everyone\u2019s feeling it, including me.</p><p>But I\u2019ve noticed that Jake seems even more pumped than the rest, and he is not ready to go back to the hotel.</p><p>I\u2019m also feeling wired from my Jake hormones which are currently on heat, but mainly because of the serenade Jake did to me \u2013 I wonder if that\u2019s what set me off, oh and also the accompanying two glasses of wine I\u2019ve had all contributing to a horny Tru.</p><p>Horny Tru, who wants in Jake\u2019s pants.</p><p>All in all, not great.</p><p>Well it would be great I imagine, but it\u2019s not going to happen.</p><p>Jake doesn\u2019t see me like that. I know he screws any woman he deems sexy enough \u2013 which is most, but to him I\u2019m just Tru Bennett who he used to live next door to once upon a time. His newly reacquainted best-friend.</p><p>Best friends, that\u2019s what me and Jake are.</p><p>I know we have the innocent flirty banter thing going on, but that\u2019s all it is, innocent.</p><p>And of course I\u2019m with Will. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Will my boyfriend. Who I love very much.</p><p>And even though my feet are killing me from my shoes; note to self, break expensive pretty shoes in before wearing for a night out, I still hear myself agreeing to go clubbing with the guys.</p><p>With Jake.</p><p>Deep down, I know I\u2019m just not ready to be away from him yet. Dangerous, but also very true.</p> <p>So now we\u2019re in the car on our way to an exclusive club here in Copenhagen.</p><p>Ben is in the car behind driving Denny and Smith. And Dave is driving me, Tom and Jake.</p><p>Tom is in the front, and I\u2019m in the back with Jake. I\u2019m hyper aware of his nearness. Of every single move he makes. And even though this car has a roomy back seat, Jake is sitting close to me.</p><p>Close enough for me to feel his heat in this well air-conditioned car. I know he doesn\u2019t realise or mean to, but he\u2019s not helping my current attraction to him subside at all.</p><p>If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d think he\u2019s doing it on purpose.</p> <p>Dave pulls the car up outside the club. It looks fancy and expensive, and there is a queue of people waiting to go in.</p><p>Dave tells us to wait in the car, and I watch as he goes over to the three burly doormen and speaks to one of them who looks to be in charge. These guys are big but they have nothing on Dave, and he seems to have such an air of authority over these doormen as he speaks to them.</p><p>The head doorman looks over Dave\u2019s shoulder in the direction of our car, then nods his head.</p><p>Dave hands the car keys to one of the other doormen, who then follows him toward our car.</p><p>Dave opens Jake\u2019s door, then Tom\u2019s, as the doorman climbs into the driver seat of our car.</p><p>Jake climbs out, and then waiting for me, takes my hand, helping me out of the car. He doesn\u2019t let go when I\u2019m out of the car and no longer needing his help, and my body flames under his touch.</p> <p>The music is pumping out of the club, and the level of chatter from the people in the queue increases exponentially at the arrival of the TMS boys.</p><p>I feel proud in this moment to be here with them.</p><p>Denny and Smith join us, leaving Ben to park their car, and then we all walk toward the club entrance, Dave sticking close by Jake, who is keeping me close to him, and the doormen make a clear path for us into the club.</p><p>Once inside, a guy introducing himself as the manager of the club guides us straight up to the VIP section.</p><p>I know Jake hates VIP sections in clubs. He never has them at the after show parties. When I asked him why, he said, \u2018What\u2019s the point of throwing a party and then just sitting on the outside watching everyone else have all the fuckin\u2019 fun.\u2019</p><p>His words not mine.</p><p>But he also knows it\u2019s not always viable for him to go to a club and sit in the cheap seats, so to say, well not unless he\u2019s after a good groping and a night of signing autographs and posing for pictures. Actually knowing Jake, the groping probably wouldn\u2019t bother him too much.</p><p>And I guess him and the guys being up in the VIP section makes Dave and Ben\u2019s job a lot easier.</p> <p>Me personally, as I\u2019ve recently discovered, am also not a huge fan of the VIP sections either, well, except for maybe at airports \u2013 those are my new found love.</p><p>I just find VIP\u2019s in clubs to be a little pretentious, and I\u2019m taking about the people in them. Not Jake and the guys of course. We\u2019re all kind pretty much cut from the same cloth in that respect.</p><p>Jake and me especially.</p><p>The fun is happening downstairs in the main part of the club, not in this stuffy area, but it\u2019s not like I can just off and hop downstairs to mingle. It would be rude of me.</p><p>So I\u2019m here in the VIP section, ensuring not to talk to Jake too much.</p><p>Right now I\u2019m sitting in a booth talking to Denny.</p><p>I like Denny, and even more so, the more time I spend with him. He\u2019s the kind of guy, if you were lucky enough to have a brother and got to pick who it would be, then Denny would be your first choice.</p><p>He\u2019s funny, quick and laid back, really easy to talk to. And why the guy is single is beyond me. Or maybe it\u2019s a choice, the way he wants his life to be at the moment. It\u2019s known he was in a serious relationship for a long while and they split not long after Jonny died.</p><p>So I\u2019ve been sat with Denny for the last hour drinking bottled beer, while he\u2019s been regaling stories of all of their time together at college, before they left to focus on the band, and also when they first started out gigging, things they got up to, that kind of thing.</p><p>He\u2019s kept the stories pretty clean \u2013 I\u2019m guessing for my benefit. And one thing I have noticed is he\u2019s staying light on the stories about Jake. I can imagine there are a lot of stories to be told about Jake in college and even more on the road with the band, so I wonder why Denny\u2019s holding back on them.</p><p>We\u2019ve also been having a real giggle over Tom and his prowling on the ladies.</p><p>The man is unstoppable.</p><p>Some of these girls just don\u2019t stand a chance. But then I don\u2019t think they want to \u2013 I think they are more than willing to be Tom\u2019s girl for the night.</p><p>And it seems he\u2019s picked his girl out for the night, seemingly settled on a pretty blonde girl.</p><p>Occasionally, I\u2019ve cast a quick glance in Jake\u2019s direction just to see what he\u2019s up to; currently he\u2019s leant up against the bar, elbows rested back on it, drinking beer and talking to Smith.</p><p>He\u2019s giving off an air of unapproachable. And he\u2019s showing absolutely no interest in any of the women who are trying to drown him in looks.</p><p>Actually now I think about it, since I\u2019ve been on this tour Jake hasn\u2019t been living up to the womanising ways he\u2019s so famous for. Right now he\u2019s talking to Smith. The only married guy here. He\u2019s not with Tom, the one who is always on the lookout for a skirt or some pussy, as he puts it.</p><p>I wonder if it\u2019s because I\u2019m here. Not that I\u2019m vain enough to think it\u2019s because he wants me. I just mean, I wonder if he\u2019s trying to keep things respectable for my sake.</p><p>I hope not. I\u2019d hate for him to feel uncomfortable and not be able to be himself because of me. But I am also glad I don\u2019t have to watch him mauling women.</p><p>Maybe I should talk to him about it. Hmm ... I\u2019m not sure how I would broach that subject though. One to file for later I think.</p><p>Jake glances over catching my eye. I smile at him then focus back onto what Denny is saying.</p><p>The next thing I know, Jake is stood over me. \u201cTru, come and dance with me.\u201d</p><p>Picking my bottle of beer up, I glance up at him and shake my head. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t be bothered, and my feet are killing me.\u201d</p><p>These goddamn shoes, I really should have broken them in first.</p><p>\u201cBut I want to dance,\u201d he says. There\u2019s a real insistence to his tone. It surprises me.</p><p>\u201cSo go dance,\u201d I say, giving him a look. \u201cI\u2019m talking to Denny right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to dance on my own,\u201d he pouts and I know he\u2019s trying a different line of attack. He reminds me of young Jake here in this moment.</p><p>I let out a laugh. \u201cJake there are plenty of willing victims for you to dance with.\u201d I waft my hand around at the women, some who aren\u2019t even pretending not to stare at him right now.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to dance with them, I want to dance with you.\u201d He sets his mouth into a hard line.</p><p>I\u2019m getting the impression this is more because for some reason he doesn\u2019t want me here talking to Denny anymore, and not that he actually does want to dance with me.</p><p>\u201cJust dance with him and get it over with, Tru,\u201d Denny chuckles. \u201cHe won\u2019t let up until he gets his own way.\u201d</p><p>Denny gives Jake an amused look as he takes a swig of his beer, and I feel like I\u2019m missing out on the something that passes between them.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I sigh loudly, putting my beer down on the table. \u201cBut if I can\u2019t walk later because these heels have shredded my feet, then you\u2019re carrying me back to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d he smiles a winning smile. It irks me some. Well quite a bit actually.</p><p>Denny shuffles out of the booth we\u2019re sitting in, letting me out. The instant I stand up my feet start to hurt in these goddamn shoes.</p><p>Jake takes hold of my hand and starts to lead me off but it\u2019s hurting to walk.</p><p>\u201cActually, hang on,\u201d I say to Jake, stopping. Keeping steady on his hand, I pull my shoes off with the other.</p><p>I toss them onto the seat beside Denny. \u201cLook after these for me.\u201d</p><p>As I turn back, Jake\u2019s looking at me like he doesn\u2019t actually know what to do with me right now. Like he\u2019s never seen a woman take her shoes off in a club before.</p><p>I bet women have taken off more than just their shoes in a club for him; actually maybe their shoes were the one thing that did stay on, maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s freaking him out.</p><p>And with that thought in mind, I walk past him, bare foot, and a smirk on my face. \u201cYou coming or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese floors are gross you know,\u201d he says falling into step beside me. \u201cBeer, gum, puke...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to dance with you, this is how you\u2019re getting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith puke covered feet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh huh.\u201d I glance up at him, a grin in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhatever way I can get you, Tru,\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>I don\u2019t look at him ... can\u2019t look at him.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure whether he meant me to hear that comment in the noise of the music or not, so for now I\u2019m pretending I didn\u2019t.</p><p>He takes hold of my hand again and veers off, leading me away from the tiny VIP dance floor, and down the stairs, leading us straight toward the main dance floor downstairs.</p><p>This is more like it.</p><p>I look over my shoulder and see Dave shaking his head, looking exasperated, following quickly in our wake. I\u2019m guessing Jake pulls this stuff on a regular basis. It must frustrate Dave that Jake doesn\u2019t count his personal safety as something high on his list. Makes his job a lot harder.</p><p>And in this moment he reminds me of the rebellious teenager he used to be. The rebellious teenagers we used to be together.</p><p>Before he left me behind.</p><p>I tread carefully down the stairs behind Jake, regretting leaving my shoes now, in case of broken glass or getting my toes trodden on. But as we move downwards, heading into the masses, Jake doesn\u2019t have to push his way through the people crowding the stairs. They just seem to automatically move for him, like he\u2019s commanding them to with his sheer presence alone.</p><p>It\u2019s a lot weird, and also a little awesome.</p><p>And at least there is also no danger of anyone getting close enough to tread on my feet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re short without your heels on,\u201d he says, turning to me, as he hits the bottom step, leaving us a little closer to eye level.</p><p>\u201cYeah and you\u2019re a selfish prick.\u201d</p><p>Whoa! Where the hell did that come from, Tru?</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He looks taken aback and pissed off.</p><p>Can\u2019t say I blame him really.</p><p>But if I\u2019m being honest, I know where that came from. I\u2019m a little angry with him. I\u2019ve felt it simmering away under the surface all night. It started back at the show at the serenade.</p><p>The moment he started singing to me I felt a huge, heady mixture of lust and anger, and it lanced through me and straight in his direction. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Okay, so if I\u2019m going with total honesty here ... I\u2019m pissed at him because he\u2019s made me want him tonight.</p><p>And I don\u2019t just mean I want in his pants. I mean I want him - want him. I want him to be mine.</p><p>I know it\u2019s stupid and irrational, and I\u2019m with Will, but I can\u2019t help the way I feel.</p><p>He\u2019s Jake.</p> <p>I\u2019ve loved him for a long time. But this, here now, what I feel inside for him ... it\u2019s like a fire is burning inside me, and I don\u2019t foresee a way to put it out anytime soon.</p><p>And I\u2019m not exactly in a position to be able to douse that fire named Jake.</p><p>I\u2019m also currently in a position where I have to spend an inordinate amount of time with him. A position he put me in.</p><p>It\u2019s the worst kind of torture.</p><p>So yeah, I\u2019m feeling a little pissed at him, and for some reason it\u2019s decided to make an appearance now, here on the steps of this club, surrounded by hundreds of people.</p> <p>It\u2019s just ... he serenaded me for God\u2019s sake! How the hell am I supposed to recover from that?</p><p>\u201cYou heard,\u201d I say standing tall. \u201cYou serenaded, and outed me in front of two hundred people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuted you?\u201d he gives an amused look, but I can tell behind the fa\u00e7ade, he\u2019s still a little pissed off.</p><p>Of course it only manages to annoy further.</p><p>\u201cYou told everyone my name and I like my anonymity, Jake, and not to become the subject of your groupies hate chat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you sang a song like \u2018Through It All\u2019 to me.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me puzzled. \u201cBut I thought you liked the song? You said it\u2019s your favourite out of all the songs I\u2019ve ever written.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, and I do love it. But that\u2019s not the point. It\u2019s an inappropriate song to sing it to me \u2013 I have a boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>He steps back a little and a tiny frown sets on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I was dry humping you on stage, Tru.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know but\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it can be arranged if you want. I\u2019ll be only more than happy to dry hump you on stage, or in private, you know whatever suits, just let me know.\u201d</p><p>And there he is. It\u2019s like a bloody affliction with him.</p><p>\u201cArrghh! Stop with the constant flirting!\u201d I put my hand to my head frustrated.</p> <p>He frowns for real now. \u201cThe flirting bothers you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you liked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He scrunches his brow up. \u201cLook, song and flirting aside.\u201d He steps closer to me. It muggy\u2019s my thoughts up. \u201cHave I done something else to upset you, Tru?\u201d</p><p>Yes, you\u2019ve made it almost impossible for me to not want you. And now I\u2019m confused and wanting you, and worried if I dance with you that I might do something stupid, like make a move on you, and ruin our friendship when you of course reject me, and I\u2019ll also quite possibly screw things with Will up.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why the theatrics?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s my turn to frown. \u201cI\u2019m not being dramatic! I just didn\u2019t want to dance with you because my feet are hurting from my shoes and you wouldn\u2019t listen to me, and you all but forced me into it!\u201d</p><p>He looks confused now. To be honest I\u2019m a little confused as to where I\u2019m going with this myself.</p><p>It\u2019s like I\u2019m desperately throwing mud at him waiting for some to stick.</p><p>I want him to fight with me. But he just won\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m sorry. We won\u2019t dance.\u201d He lifts his hands in surrender, looking all wounded and moves to walk back up the stairs past me.</p><p>Oh God! Now I feel all bad for projecting my own feelings onto him, and blaming him for just being himself.</p><p>I\u2019m such a bitch.</p><p>I catch hold of his hand as he\u2019s passing, bringing him to a stop beside me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say.</p><p>He stares at me, saying nothing and I feel compelled to keep talking, to explain my behaviour.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just tired and ratty, and I shouldn\u2019t have said those things. I didn\u2019t mean them. I\u2019m just being a bitch. Forgive me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes soften. \u201cYou\u2019re forgiven. Like I could ever stay mad at you.\u201d He cups my chin with his other hand and kisses my cheek. \u201cLook if you\u2019re tired we can go back to the hotel and go to bed?\u201d he says into my ear, his hot breathe tickling the skin on my neck, and other far off, unreachable places.</p><p>Go to bed? Okay, as inviting at that is it\u2019s probably not the best idea, because my belly is pooling warm with the way you feel on my skin right now.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019ll dance. I mean my feet are already covered in nightclub crap ... puke,\u201d I smile. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>He smiles back at me, and it\u2019s beautiful. He looks so very beautiful. And all kinds of wrong.</p><p>My heart climbs out of my chest and sneaks into his, nestling in for the night.</p><p>Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s, \u2018Sweet Dreams\u2019 start to pump out of the speakers and in this moment, I know I\u2019m in trouble, but even still, it doesn\u2019t stop me from leading him onto the dance floor.</p><p>All eyes are on Jake and me. This is how it always is around him. And to be honest in this moment, I like it.</p><p>I like that every women in this club is wishing she were me right now.</p><p>Jake grabs my hips and pulls me close to him. Staring down into my eyes, he starts to move me in time with him, and the people around us just melt away.</p><p>All I can do is stare up at him, trapped in his thrall, completely helpless as he moves my body with his.</p><p>Jake can dance. And I mean really dance. Sexy, sensual every move he makes with me, for me, is like he\u2019s caressing me, heightening my senses to him.</p><p>If he can move like this on the dance floor, then I can only imagine how good he is in bed.</p><p>An image of me in bed with Jake flickers through my mind. So vivid that I feel lost in it. Lost in him. Too him. Consumed and totally intoxicated.</p><p>I feel reckless. Heedless. Like I could do anything ... want to do anything, with him, right here and now.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you learn to dance like this?\u201d I ask, forcing my voice to work, as I try to focus my mind on anything but the feel of his body pressed up against mine, as Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s vocals continue to aid my mental and physical assault over my need for Jake.</p><p>\u201cThe Bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Bedroom. Bed. Jake in my bed. Naked.</p><p>Focus Tru, focus.</p><p>\u201cIs that a dance school?\u201d</p><p>I really couldn\u2019t imagine Jake going to dance class; it doesn\u2019t really fit with him.</p><p>\u201cNo, Tru.\u201d He stares down at me, blue eyes piercing. \u201cIn. The. Bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Oh crap.</p><p>I gulp down.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no real difference between having sex and dancing.\u201d He runs his hand up my arm, slowly, deliberately, until it\u2019s cupping my shoulder. He starts to rub his thumb over my skin. It hums wherever he touches.</p><p>\u201cN-no?\u201d I stammer.</p><p>I mean what else can I say? I\u2019m kind of having a pretty hard time concentrating right now.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He presses his delicious lips together and slowly shakes his head. He hasn\u2019t taken his eyes off mine yet. And I suddenly feel naked, so very naked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just unfortunate you have to keep your clothes on for one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm ... well, naked dancing here might attract some stares, Jake,\u201d I manage out.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to remain calm, but my heart has exited on me, my legs are trembling and every sense in me has headed somewhere South.</p><p>Jake leans in close, cupping the back of my neck with his hand, his lips brush over my ear as he whispers, \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I prefer to dance in the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>He leans back and stares down at me, and then I suddenly see it there in his eyes, unconcealed.</p><p>The lust. The want. He wants me. He\u2019s trying to seduce me.</p><p>I\u2019m so completely fucked.</p><p>And now I\u2019m left wondering how I never saw it before.</p><p>I\u2019ve obviously been missing it all along. The flirting \u2013 not so innocent after all. The electrical charge I felt for him earlier \u2013 maybe not so one-sided. The serenade. Sitting close to me in the car. The lack, or actual non-existence of other women in Jake\u2019s life since I\u2019ve been back in it.</p><p>It\u2019s like all of my lights have turned on at once.</p><p>My head compounds, and my stomach tightens into a thousand tight, but very delicious knots.</p><p>And I\u2019m here gazing back at him like a rabbit mesmerised by a beautiful cobra, and any minute he\u2019s going to strike and I\u2019m done for.</p><p>Jake lets his hands drift back down to my hips, then he takes hold of my hand and spins me around, putting my back flush with his chest.</p><p>His large hands span my waist holding me firm against him.</p><p>And I\u2019m trying to pretend I don\u2019t feel him getting hard against my ass.</p><p>It\u2019s not going so well. I\u2019m starting to lose any rationality I may have had.</p><p>I want him. I want him so badly. I\u2019ve never wanted someone, as much as I do him, now.</p><p>So much so, that I\u2019m actually trying to figure out some way to have sex with Jake without it actually counting as cheating on Will.</p><p>Currently I\u2019ve come up with the different time zone theory.</p><p>Okay, so I never said it was a good theory.</p><p>Then before I know I\u2019m doing it, I\u2019m moving slowly down his body, bending my knees, keeping my back flush with him, my hands feeling their way down his sides. Then I\u2019m very slowly moving back up again.</p><p>I\u2019m putting it down to the alcohol that I suddenly think I\u2019m sexy and could ever pull off a move like this.</p><p>When I\u2019m back to height, I rest my head against his chest, sliding my hands around him, holding him to me, pressing my ass against him.</p><p>I can feel his heart hammering in his chest. It makes me feel heady and like I\u2019m suddenly in control here. I feel like I have control over Jake. It\u2019s an insanely good feeling. Maybe sexy Tru knows what\u2019s she\u2019s doing after all.</p><p>Jake suddenly grasps hold of my shoulders spinning me around to face him.</p><p>His eyes are smouldering. His look is dark, and inviting.</p><p>I want him to kiss me.</p><p>No I don\u2019t. Yes, I do.</p><p>His hand goes to the small of my back, his other around the nape of my neck, his thumb resting lightly against my throat. And we are close. Dangerously close. Our faces inches apart, as he moves us both to the music again.</p><p>My breathing has hitched up, and so has his.</p><p>Jake \u2013 a sweet dream? Or a beautiful nightmare?</p><p>Which one Tru?</p><p>A beautiful nightmare. This is Jake. This is what he does with women. It\u2019s his MO.</p><p>Don\u2019t screw things up with Will for one night with Jake.</p><p>Finally sense grabs hold of me. I step back from him, freeing myself from his thrall.</p><p>He stares at me wanting, confused, disappointed.</p><p>\u201cToilet,\u201d I say breathless. \u201cI need the toilet.\u201d Then I turn on my bare heel and swiftly move through the parting crowd, heading straight for the ladies.</p><p>I lock myself in the cubicle and sit down on the toilet.</p><p>What the hell am I doing? I was so ready to kiss him then. Kiss Jake and more.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. I think I\u2019ve just had way too much to drink tonight and I was letting myself fall into something which felt altogether too good, but is so very wrong. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jake\u2019s \u2013 Jake.

I can\u2019t let myself become just another name in his long list of conquests.</p><p>I have too much to lose if I do.</p> <p>I use the toilet, wash my hands, cool my face with the water, then with a clear straight head, I make my way back to our table in the VIP lounge.</p><p>Jake is already there sitting with the guys, and also the girl Tom has acquired for the night.</p><p>He looks up at my approach and the second my eyes meet with his, whatever sense I had just talked myself into, packs its bags and fucks off, leaving me to the mercy of my hormones.</p><p>The booth is full. Jake shuffles over, giving me a sliver of room to sit on, and also forcing me to sit next to him.</p><p>He puts his arm around the back of the seat, behind me. My thigh is pressed up tight against his.</p> <p>\u201cAlright?\u201d he asks me quietly.</p><p>I nod, yes, briefly meeting his eye.</p><p>He passes me a fresh beer. My fingers touch his and a charge flies through my hand and up my arm.</p><p>\u201cI thought we could have one more then head back to the hotel,\u201d Jake says quietly to me.</p><p>\u201cAhum,\u201d nodding, I take a mouthful of my beer.</p><p>He moves his hand down, and then I feel his thumb start to gently stroke the bare skin on my back.</p> <p>It feels intimate. So totally intimate, and that\u2019s because it is.</p><p>I chug harder on my beer.</p><p>In the irony right now wishing I was sober so I could think clearer in this situation, and how exactly to extract myself from it.</p><p>No, I\u2019ll rephrase that \u2013 figure out how to want to extract myself from it.</p><p>My head and heart are not matching at the moment, and my hormones are raging a war all on their own.</p><p>Continuing to sip on my beer, I listen to the guys talk, but I really can\u2019t focus. All I can focus on is Jake\u2019s thumb, gently stroking that one small part of my body.</p><p>It\u2019s like everything has homed in on this one small area. I\u2019m heated. My skin is humming, buzzing under his touch.</p><p>I put my beer down on the table, and bind my hands together in my lap.</p> <p>Focus. I just need to focus.</p><p>Then Jake put his hand under the table. He pushes his fingers in-between my palms, forcing my hands apart and takes hold of my hand.</p><p>Jake often holds my hand, that\u2019s nothing new, but this time it\u2019s different. There\u2019s a different meaning there. Or was it there all the other times too?</p><p>I don\u2019t know, but what I do know now, is that this feels like he\u2019s staking a claim on me.</p><p>And I like the feeling. I want to be his.</p><p>He slides his fingers in-between mine, entwining our hands like lovers would, and rests our bound hands onto his hard thigh.</p><p>I could try to pretend his touch on my back was nothing. But not this.</p><p>I look across at him.</p><p>He stares back at me steadily, for a long moment before looking away, but I read his eyes clearly.</p><p>He wants me tonight.</p><p>And from what my eyes where saying back to him, I think I just said yes.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>We finish up our drinks and leave the club, heading straight into the waiting cars.</p><p>I managed to untangle my hand from Jake\u2019s on the way out of the club, so I make a quick dash for Ben\u2019s waiting car, which Denny and Smith are just climbing into. Denny looks a little surprised to see me in their car, but he says nothing.</p><p>I could feel Jake\u2019s eyes on me as I climbed into their car, leaving him with Tom and his girl for the night, but I don\u2019t care. I just need to put some distance between us right now.</p><p>If I can just get to the hotel first and back to my room alone, then tonight will be without incident.</p><p>If not ... then I really don\u2019t know what will happen.</p><p>But even as I think it, I don\u2019t really believe it. I know exactly what will happen.</p><p>If Jake wants me tonight, then me travelling back in a separate car will not make the least bit of difference. Because I want him too, and I don\u2019t think I can find the will to say no.</p><p>When we reach the hotel, Ben pulls up first and I clamber out of the car. My feet are still bare and my shoes are in my hand along with my handbag.</p><p>I\u2019m vaguely aware of the other car pulling up, but I\u2019m too distracted by how cold this floor is outside the hotel.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ! This floor is freakin\u2019 freezing!\u201d I cry out, hopping from one foot to the other on the tiled floor. The night air isn\u2019t cold but it\u2019s like there is air con blasting out across the tiles, deep freezing them.</p><p>Smith chuckles at me, as I start to tread on my tiptoes carefully across the frozen tiles. \u201cYou okay there girlie? You need a hand?\u201d He holds his hand out for me take, but I don\u2019t get a chance to respond, because the next thing I know Jake is scooping me up in his arms.</p><p>\u201cArggh! Put me down you idiot!\u201d</p><p>Jake says nothing, and just strides through the door and into the hotel lobby with purpose, and me in his arms.</p><p>Everyone is staring at us and, Smith, Denny, Tom and his girl \u2013 whose name I still haven\u2019t gotten, are all finding this highly amusing.</p><p>\u201cYou can put me down now,\u201d I say, a little clearer and a little firmer, as we reach the carpeted floor in the hotel outside the lifts.</p><p>He stares straight into my eyes. \u201cI know but I\u2019m not going to. I start a job, I finish it.\u201d</p><p>My heart takes a clear blast in my chest, and I gulp down.</p><p>The doors ping open and Jake strides into the lift with me still in his arms.</p><p>Not even waiting for the others he presses the button for our floor.</p><p>\u201cWe look silly like this,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>\u201cAnd since when have you cared about how we look?\u201d</p><p>What can I say to that?</p><p>And truth be told, I don\u2019t want him to put me down, I like the feel of being in his arms.</p><p>Jake makes me feel like a girl. Like a woman. It\u2019s not something Will\u2019s ever truly managed to do. Not that Will\u2019s not manly, of course he is, but Jake is in a whole other league. He\u2019s alpha to the extreme.</p><p>And yes, I\u2019m independent and strong, but sometimes ... just sometimes, it\u2019s nice to be taken care of. It\u2019s nice to be made to feel like a lady.</p><p>The lift quickly reaches our floor; the top floor of course, and Jake exits, taking a left, heading toward my suite.</p><p>My suite is next to his, so I\u2019m praying he just drops me at my door, and goes to his. Actually thinking on it, my suite\u2019s always next to Jake\u2019s whichever hotel we stay in. Hmm...</p><p>Okay, so the rational side of me is praying that Jake will just leave me outside my room \u2013 what small part of it there is left. But I know he won\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cKey,\u201d he says stopping outside my door.</p><p>I rummage in my handbag, and pull my key card out. Reaching down, I put it into the slot and push the handle down, as Jake shoves my door open with his leg.</p><p>He carries me through the darkened living room of my suite, letting the door swing shut behind us. I drop my shoes to the floor and toss my handbag onto the sofa as he passes by it.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d he curses, walking into the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cYou okay,\u201d I stifle a giggle.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he grumbles. \u201cIt hurts like a mother fucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll rub it better for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a promise?\u201d His tone is serious. He\u2019s staring down at me, his eyes impenetrable in the darkness of my suite.</p><p>Looking away, I say nothing.</p><p>We reach the bedroom and Jake gently deposits me down on the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhy thank you kind, sir,\u201d I say putting on a really bad Southern accent like Smith\u2019s, except his is actually cool. \u201cYour work here is done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, it\u2019s not.\u201d He pulls his boots off and climbs onto the bed, lying down beside me.</p><p>\u201cAre you staying?\u201d I ask, nervous.</p><p>\u201cOf course I am. I\u2019m not leaving my girl drunk and alone. You might be sick and choke on your own vomit.\u201d</p><p>His girl? And also, worst excuse ever for climbing into my bed, Jake, seriously.</p><p>But then I\u2019m not exactly fighting him out of here either.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not drunk,\u201d I giggle. \u201cAnd just trust me, I\u2019ve taken care of myself in worse states than this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well you shouldn\u2019t have had to.\u201d</p><p>What\u2019s that supposed to mean? Was that a dig at Will?</p><p>He turns on his side and faces me in the darkness. \u201cDo you want me to go?\u201d he murmurs, and his voice suddenly sounds all deep and intense.</p><p>Shivers envelop me. My heart-rate increases, and my breathing hitches.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine, stay. But I need to pee,\u201d I say, voice pitchy, as I climb off the bed.</p><p>I cross the bedroom on seriously wobbly legs, which have nothing to do with the alcohol in my system, and everything to do with Jake in my bed over there, and grab my pyjamas; a vest and short set, and stumble into the bathroom, closing the door behind me.</p><p>I pee, brush my teeth, take my make-up off and climb in the shower.</p><p>After I finish my shower, I put my pyjamas on, towel dry my newly clean hair, and tie it damp into a messy knot.</p><p>I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ve been gone long enough so that Jake has fallen asleep because I\u2019ve got a feeling if he hasn\u2019t, I\u2019m soon going to be making the mistake, I really want to make with him tonight.</p><p>I turn the light off before opening the bathroom door, then I quietly let myself back into the bedroom and pad my way across the carpeted floor.</p><p>As I\u2019m nearing the bed, Jake utters, \u201cWell that was the longest pee in history. What the fuck were you doing in there?\u201d</p><p>So he is still awake. Crap.</p><p>\u201cI took a shower, just like you should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saying I smell?\u201d he chuckles.</p><p>I pull the duvet back and climb into bed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying, but if you\u2019re too lazy to take a shower, can you at least take your stinky ass clothes off, and get your own blanket out of the wardrobe.\u201d</p><p>Laying on my back, I tuck the duvet safely around me.</p><p>Like that will stop Jake getting near me if he wants to. The man could undress a woman with one look alone.</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>He clambers up off the bed and I watch in the dark as he pulls his T-shirt off over his head and removes his jeans, leaving him in just his boxer shorts. His sexy, tight black boxer shorts.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I do stink,\u201d he says sniffing his T-shirt, then his armpit. He tosses his shirt to the floor next to his jeans. \u201cI\u2019ll take a quick shower.\u201d</p><p>He disappears off into the bathroom, leaving the door ajar and the light flooding into the bedroom.</p><p>I lay here, my heart beating up a storm in my chest. My whole body on fire, as I listen to the running water, desperate to go climb back in that shower with Jake, and do things with him I shouldn\u2019t want to do.</p><p>I hear the water go off, then he re-emerges a few minutes later, wearing only a towel around his waist, his hair all damp and mussed up.</p><p>I\u2019m so done for.</p><p>He leaves the bathroom door ajar again, a splay of light in the room illuminating his nearly naked form, his tattoos looking intricate in the low-light. He looks beautiful, and I wonder if he\u2019s done it on purpose leaving the light on him, giving me a full view.</p><p>Maybe he left the door open while he was getting a shower on purpose too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe it was an invitation.</p><p>He saunters over and drops back onto the bed, wearing only the towel.</p><p>This is not good. Well, it is good, great in fact ... but not good for so many reasons.</p><p>He rolls onto his side facing me. \u201cDo you remember when we used to sleep together like this when we were kids?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do.\u201d I smile at the memory.</p><p>In the early days \u2013 the bad days when Jake\u2019s dad was still around, he started staying over at my house regularly to get away from him, and even after his dad was gone, Jake still carried on staying over; by that point it had just became our thing.</p><p>\u201cMy dad put a stop to that when we were about eleven though, if I remember rightly,\u201d I add.</p><p>\u201cHe always was a smart guy. I wouldn\u2019t have left me alone in bed with you if you were my daughter either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven when you were eleven?\u201d I laugh.</p> <p>\u201cEven when I was eleven.\u201d His voice is suddenly thick with inclination.</p><p>I feel a shiver deep inside my stomach, which quickly heads downwards, settling in-between my legs.</p><p>I turn onto my side so we\u2019re facing each other. \u201cHow old were you when you lost your virginity?\u201d</p><p>I know that\u2019s a really intrusive question, but I\u2019m little drunk and I don\u2019t care, because I want to know if he ever slept with anyone back home before he left for America. I always thought I knew everything about Jake back then, but after he left and he cut me off, I started to think maybe not, because the Jake I thought I knew would never have left me like that.</p><p>He stares at me for a long moment. I wish I knew what was going through his mind.</p><p>\u201cSixteen,\u201d he finally answers.</p> <p>Even though I got the answer I wanted, I still feel a sharp stab of jealously.</p><p>\u201cWho was she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one ... someone who should have been you.\u201d</p><p>Whoa!</p><p>He reaches his hand up and runs his fingertips along my jaw. My skin hums under his touch.</p><p>\u201cI had such a crush on you when we were kids,\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>He did? Holy fuck.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bit late telling me now,\u201d I smile weakly.</p> <p>I\u2019m nervous. So very nervous.</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>I knew this moment would happen when I danced with him at the club. The moment he climbed into my bed.</p><p>Maybe even subconsciously, I knew it would happen the very first moment I saw him standing there in that hotel suite for the interview.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to remain calm but my insides are going nuts. My heart is pounding in my chest.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whisper. \u201cYou\u2019re not too late.\u201d</p><p>He traces his thumb over my lower lip. I gasp at the feeling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling in one of my birthday presents, Tru,\u201d he says softly. His eyes look opaque, heavy with desire.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d My voice is quiet, trembling.</p><p>Propping himself up on his elbow, I tilt my head back as he looks down at me.</p><p>He pulls my hair free from its knot, running his fingers through it.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d He moves his face close to mine, staying a breath away, waiting for his invitation.</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>He pulls in a breath, then very slowly, not taking his eyes from mine, leans in and kisses me.</p><p>My body and mind explode with sensation and feeling. I\u2019ve never felt anything like it before.</p><p>I\u2019m lost to him.</p><p>All these years of wanting him and wondering, and he is so much more than I could ever have imagined.</p><p>My fingers snake into his damp hair, holding him to me.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Tru,\u201d he groans in my mouth. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted you for so long.\u201d There\u2019s such a ragged need in his voice, it makes me tremble all the way down to my sex.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I breathe.</p><p>With a moan, he continues his gentle assault of my mouth with his tongue.</p><p>He tastes and feels even better than I ever dreamed he would. It\u2019s like waiting years and years for the present you have always wanted, longed for, then unwrapping it and finding it\u2019s so much more than you ever imagined it could be.</p><p>Will is far, far from my mind, and I couldn\u2019t stop this even if I wanted too. And I don\u2019t want to.</p><p>We\u2019re tangled up in each other, kissing, deep and passionate, and for this moment, in this darkness, there is only me and him in the whole entire world.</p><p>Jake pushes the duvet off me, rolls me onto my back, laying on top of me, resting up on one arm so not to crush me.</p><p>I run my hands up his tattooed arms and over onto his bare chest, tracing his skin with my fingers.</p><p>He breaks from our kiss and stares down at me for a long moment. Then he places his hand on my chest, over my heart, and very slowly, moves it down, his fingers tracing over my breasts.</p><p>My heart is thumping.</p><p>His fingertips skim my stomach, moving around the hem of my vest.</p><p>Nervous, but wanting him so badly, I reach down and lift my vest up, inclining slightly, I pull it off over my head, tossing it to the floor, I lay back down. I\u2019m not wearing a bra, and I\u2019m obviously feeling really brave thanks to the alcohol in my system.</p><p>Jake\u2019s eyes roam me, devouring me.</p><p>\u201cYou are so beautiful,\u201d he says in a low voice.</p><p>Beautiful? He thinks I\u2019m beautiful.</p><p>He leans down and kisses me again, hard and deep, almost like his life depends on it. He puts his hand on my breast, gently tracing his thumb around my nipple. It instantly hardens under his expert touch.</p><p>He definitely knows how to touch a woman. But then he\u2019s had a lot of practice.</p><p>I shove the thought aside</p><p>Jake gently pushes my leg to the side, I part them further allowing him closer.</p><p>I can feel his erection digging in my thigh. I\u2019m so turned on my whole body is trembling.</p><p>I\u2019m nervous. I\u2019ve never been this nervous with a guy before, not that I\u2019ve been with many, well three to be exact.</p><p>But Jake\u2019s different. He\u2019s always been different.</p><p>And he\u2019s slept with so many women, what if I don\u2019t measure up? What if I\u2019m a disappointment for him?</p><p>I\u2019m also trying not to think about the fact that even though I promised myself earlier I wouldn\u2019t become another number in Jake\u2019s very long list, I\u2019m well on my way to letting that happen, with no care, or inclination to stop.</p><p>His hand moves from my breast, down my body. Lifting up, he kneels between my legs, and it\u2019s at that point I see he\u2019s lost his towel.</p><p>Holy fuck, he is huge. And I mean huge.</p><p>I gulp down, worrying how the hell he\u2019s going to actually fit inside me.</p><p>Jake sees my staring and grins.</p><p>I bite my lip to stop from passing comment, knowing I\u2019ll probably come out with some lame shit and kill the moment.</p><p>His fingers hook into the top of my pyjama shorts and he starts to pull them down. I lift my bum, allowing them free, then put my leg to the side, so he can remove them fully.</p><p>I can\u2019t take my eyes off him. I\u2019m entranced, and I\u2019m his completely.</p><p>As I\u2019m moving my leg back around him, he grabs hold of it and kisses my leg, ever so lightly running his tongue over my skin, upwards, he travels higher and higher, teasing my skin with his tongue and light kisses until he reaches the apex of my thigh.</p><p>I feel heady with desire. All I want is him, now.</p><p>Lifting his head, he stares up at me. My mouth goes dry from that one look alone. I moisten my lips with my tongue.</p><p>His eyes flicker and flame. Without taking his eyes from mine, he slides his fingers between my panties and skin, then very gently he pushes his finger inside me. I almost come on the spot.</p><p>Rubbing his thumb over my sex, he starts to kiss a path up my stomach, to my neck, my jaw, my mouth, all the while, his fingers working their magic on me.</p><p>\u201cAhh,\u201d I moan, closing my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIs that good?\u201d he asks rough.</p><p>\u201cSo good,\u201d I breathe.</p><p>Needing to feel him, I reach my hand down and wrap my fingers around his hardness. Taking a firm hold, I start to move my hand, up and down.</p><p>He makes a low guttural sound in his throat, then pulls his finger out of me so quickly that I gasp.</p><p>Then he\u2019s ripping my panties off. And when I say ripping, I mean he actually tears them off, shredding them. No one has ever done that to me before, and it\u2019s insanely hot.</p><p>Leaving me wanting, he reaches down to the floor, picking his jeans up. I hear rustling and, then he\u2019s returning with a condom in his hand and a question in his eyes.</p><p>He\u2019s asking for my permission. He wants me to say yes.</p><p>I want to say yes. More than I\u2019ve ever wanted anything before.</p><p>With trembling fingers, I take the condom from his hand and tear the foil open with my teeth.</p><p>His eyes are wide and flaming. His breath\u2019s heavy.</p><p>He kneels before me.</p><p>I reach over, and with shaky fingers, put the condom on him. I can feel his body trembling under my hands.</p><p>It does extraordinary things to me. I\u2019m literally panting with desire.</p><p>He moves between my legs, resting up on his arms, hovering over me, he starts to kiss me hard on the mouth again.</p><p>I grab hold of his backside pulling him closer to me. I just want him inside me. I want him so much. I\u2019m aching to feel him. Years and years of wanting him, coursing through me.</p><p>He pauses, breathing heavily and lifts himself up on his arms, away from me, parting our bodies. \u201cYou\u2019ve been drinking, Tru. Maybe we shouldn\u2019t do this now, maybe we should wait.\u201d</p><p>What? Is he joking?</p><p>I look up at him. No, he isn\u2019t.</p><p>He waits until we\u2019re this close to pause. To think.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to wait. I don\u2019t want to think. And I\u2019m the one who really should be thinking right now out of the two of us.</p><p>My body is screaming for him. I need him to relive the ache I have for him. The one that has been trapped in me for well over a decade.</p><p>I lift my hips, meeting back with him, pressing against him. \u201cI\u2019ve waited long enough,\u201d I breathe.</p><p>Whatever control he was trying to maintain instantly vanishes.</p><p>Then he\u2019s back on me, pressing me into the bed, fisting my hair, kissing me deeply, holding me in place.</p><p>I kiss him back equally as passionate, my hands on his back, gripping him to me.</p><p>I want him so badly, but now I\u2019m also feeling a little nervous about his size.</p><p>Jake must sense this, because he whispers, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take it slow.\u201d</p><p>He slides his hand under my lower back, lifting me up, he very gently, and very slowly eases himself into me.</p><p>I gasp, all but convulsing on the spot. He is filling me and more.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks, voice soft, lifting his head to look at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m better than okay.\u201d I reach up and pull his mouth back down to mine.</p><p>He moves his hand out from under me, but I leave my hips lifted, meeting him, as he slowly pulls out and then rocks back into me, going in a little further, a little deeper.</p><p>I moan in line with the feeling.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Tru,\u201d he groans, gently biting down on my lip. \u201cYou feel amazing.\u201d</p><p>I try not to think of how many women he\u2019s said the very same thing too.</p><p>Then as if reading my mind, he stops moving inside me.</p><p>Holding my face with his hand, fingers buried deep in my hair, he stares down at me in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always been you, Tru. Always.\u201d</p><p>And suddenly it doesn\u2019t just feel like we\u2019re having sex anymore.

I want to believe his words. I want to believe that it\u2019s always been me.</p><p>Because if I\u2019m throwing everything I have away with Will for this moment, then I need to believe it\u2019s worth it.</p> <p>Jake takes hold of my hand, entwining our fingers, he rests them beside my head on the pillow, his other cupping my face, he kisses me, his pace picking up, moving further inside me, and now I\u2019m used to his size, I let him, needing this and more.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he groans. \u201cThis is ... Tru ... you feel ... fuccckk.\u201d</p><p>I move my mouth from his, kissing his jaw, nipping his skin with my teeth. Knowing that I\u2019m doing this to him, making him feel this way, makes me feel hot, sexy and uninhibited.</p><p>So totally unlike me.</p><p>And I surprise myself, when I hear the words escaping my husky sounding mouth, \u201cSit up, Jake.\u201d</p> <p>A brief pause while he meets my eyes.</p><p>Understanding what I want, Jake puts his arm under my back, lifting me with him, staying inside me, he sits back onto his heels with me straddling him.</p><p>With my hair damp and flowing down my back, I place my hands on his shoulders. Very slowly, I start to move up and down on his length. In this position I can have as much or as little of Jake as I want, and I want all of him.</p><p>His hands are on my hips, moving with me. Then they\u2019re on my breasts, then upwards tangling into my hair and he\u2019s pulling my face to his, kissing me again.</p><p>It\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t know which part of me he wants to touch the most.</p><p>And I like that he\u2019s this out of control over me.</p> <p>I start to move faster and faster, and before I know it I feel the build inside me, so soon and so intense, I couldn\u2019t hold off even if I wanted to.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jake,\u201d I groan as I come forcefully, like I\u2019ve never come before, exploding all around him.</p><p>While I\u2019m coming, Jake drives me back into the bed, and starts to fuck me hard, then he\u2019s tensing, rigid, calling out my name.</p><p>We lay, panting breathless for minutes after, both coming down from our high.</p><p>Jake moves off me, lying beside me, he takes his condom off, tying a knot in the end, he drops it to the floor and pulls me into his arms.</p><p>\u201cThat was amazing,\u201d he murmurs, kissing my hair. \u201cI wish we\u2019d done this year\u2019s ago.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t find the words to speak.</p><p>Because he\u2019s right, we should have done this year\u2019s ago, before he left. Pre-Will.</p> <p>Guilt washes over me like a tidal wave, taking everything with it.</p><p>But then if we had, had sex all those years ago, he would have ruined me, because I would have never recovered from it. I would have never recovered from him.</p><p>Because I know unequivocally I\u2019ll never recover from this, from what we\u2019ve just done.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Where the hell is that music coming from?</p><p>Adele. Crap, my phone\u2019s ringing and it\u2019s in my bag in the living room.</p><p>I untangle myself from a very naked Jake, and make a dash for my bag.</p><p>Grabbing it off the sofa I rip it open, retrieve my phone and answer without looking at the caller display.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I say breathless.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you out of breath?\u201d</p><p>Vicky.</p><p>\u201cBecause I was in bed and my phone was in the living room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd were you in bed with Jake?\u201d</p><p>What?!</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake \u2013 is it true?\u201d she asks with a conspiratorial tone to her voice.</p><p>I look around the room suspiciously. I\u2019m half-expecting her to jump out on me any second now.</p><p>\u201cIs what true about Jake?\u201d My voice trembles slightly, and I curse it.</p><p>\u201cTru, stop evading \u2013 is it, or is it not true that you and Jake are sleeping together?\u201d</p><p>My heart stops in my chest. No beating, no nothing. I think I may actually be dead right now. And it would so serve me right if I was.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I exclaim, coming back to life. \u201cWhy would you ask that?\u201d I try to keep my voice steady, but it did wobble a little again, I\u2019m just hoping she didn\u2019t notice.</p><p>\u201cYou so are!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not.\u201d I put my best \u2018I\u2019m not fucking kidding\u2019 voice on.</p><p>I hear Jake move in bed. I spin on the spot looking at him through the open door.</p><p>Guilt stains all over me in this moment, as I look on at the very evidence of my betrayal of Will, before me.</p><p>So not only do I cheat, I also lie about cheating.</p><p>I hate to lie to Vicky, but I can\u2019t exactly tell her the truth. Will has to be the one to be told first. And honestly, I haven\u2019t even had a chance to sort it all through in my own mind quite yet as to how that\u2019s going to unfold.</p><p>Then I look down at myself and realise I\u2019m completely naked.</p><p>\u201cTru? Are you still there?\u201d Vicky sounds a little concerned.</p><p>\u201cUm ... yeah. Just give me a sec,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>Removing my phone from my ear, I keep it in my hand and tiptoe back into the bedroom. I pick up the first item of clothing I find, which happens to be Jake\u2019s stinky T-shirt from last night, and pull it on.</p><p>But it doesn\u2019t smell so stinky anymore. It just smells of Jake. It pains and pleases me at the same time.</p><p>Silently, I walk back through to the living room, closing the door quietly behind me. I sit down on the edge of the coffee table facing the closed bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m back,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cAll okay?\u201d Vicky asks, she still sounds concerned. And I feel sick.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I just needed a drink of water, was feeling a little dry ... so why on earth do you think I\u2019m sleeping with Jake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s splashed all over the internet, my darling,\u201d she says softly. \u201cPictures of you dancing up close and personal in a club with Jake, then there\u2019s shots of him carrying you into a hotel.\u201d</p><p>Oh, fuck.</p><p>We were followed here by the paps.</p><p>Her words are thudding around my head, chasing on the tails of many, many other questions and fears I have.</p><p>How did I not even notice we were being photographed in the club, or at the hotel?</p><p>Because I was too wrapped up in Jake.</p><p>Why would they be so interested in Jake with me? It\u2019s not unusual for Jake to be seen with a woman.</p><p>\u201cThey know who you are, my darling,\u201d she continues as if reading my mind. \u201cThat you\u2019re doing his bio, your name is in the article.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so maybe there\u2019s my answer why they\u2019re so interested. Jake is sleeping with his biographer. That\u2019s going to pique a little interest for the dirt-dishers.</p><p>\u201cWhat else does it say?\u201d I ask in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cThat Jake serenaded you at the show they were recording last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I sigh.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich song?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrough It All.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says.</p><p>Yes, oh, indeed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, it also says here that he said you are the love of his life right before he serenaded you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never said that!\u201d I cry.</p><p>I cover my hand with my mouth, realising how loud I was. I don\u2019t want to wake Jake.</p><p>\u201cHe never said that I\u2019m the love of his life,\u201d I repeat in a quieter voice.</p><p>Goddamn tabloid journo\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou know how they like to make things up, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else does it say?\u201d I ask, cringing on the question. \u201cDo they know Jake and I grew up together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm...\u201d I can just imagine her eyes scanning the text in that way she does. And then I\u2019m suddenly hit with stinging tears at the back of my eyes, and I just want to tell her everything. She\u2019s one of my closest friends and right now I really need a friend.</p><p>But deep down I know I can\u2019t tell her. I\u2019ve betrayed Will enough already as it is.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she concludes. \u201cIt just goes on about you being his biographer ... oh and the magazine is mentioned!\u201d she squeals. \u201cUm ... well it just says you work here,\u201d she quickly adds, recovering herself. \u201cOkay, there\u2019s the dancing together in the club ... that Jake\u2019s eyes were on you all night and no one else according to onlookers...\u201d They were? \u201cThat he seemed really into you...\u201d He did? \u201cShowed absolutely no interest in anyone else whatsoever, and that you left the club together and went back to the hotel, and it finishes saying that maybe you\u2019re the one to finally tame Jake.\u201d</p><p>The one? They think I\u2019m the one to tame Jake?</p><p>Not bloody likely. I don\u2019t think Jake is tameable.</p><p>Then his words from last night play in my ears, \u2018It\u2019s always been you, Tru. Always.\u2019</p><p>\u201cTru, are you still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm ... yes, sorry, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook this is fine,\u201d Vicky impresses. \u201cNo press is bad press, remember, my darling. The media interest in you will quickly die down, and then you can get back to concentrating on the bio. If anything it will be good for the story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, that people think Jake\u2019s screwing his biographer?\u201d I come off as short and terse. It\u2019s because I am.</p><p>And because it\u2019s the truth. Jake has screwed his biographer. His non-single, in a relationship with Will, biographer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to look at the positives here, Tru.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I run my hand through my tangled hair. Hair that Jake tangled up. When he was in bed with me.</p><p>Inside me.</p><p>Shit. I\u2019ve so totally and monumentally fucked everything up.</p><p>And even though the shit has totally hit the fan, I still get a shiver at the memory of his hands on me ... of him inside me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just all a lot to take in with a hangover and a few hours\u2019 sleep.\u201d I blow out a breath. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to call Will aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe probably won\u2019t have seen the news yet. He\u2019s more likely to read the Times than The Sun, right? And it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve done anything wrong, my darling, so don\u2019t let that boy give you a hard time about this.\u201d</p><p>I feel sick. I wish I was in the bathroom right now because I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m going to throw up any minute.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd thanks for calling to give me the heads up. You\u2019re too good to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019d call. I would always call. I love you, darling girl. You\u2019ll call me later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I will.\u201d</p><p>I hang the phone up with Vicky, and stare down at my phone in my trembling hand.</p><p>I quickly go online on my phone and straight to Google and search Jake\u2019s name under recent news.</p><p>And there they are, the pictures.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>They do not look good at all. They look incriminating.</p><p>Which they are, were ... kind of.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>With shaky fingers, I close the internet down, and speed dial Will\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cHey, beautiful,\u201d he coos down the phone. \u201cI was just thinking about you.\u201d</p><p>At the sound of his lovely voice, I almost break down.</p><p>And by his tone, I\u2019m guessing he hasn\u2019t seen the news yet. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good thing or not. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll good I hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all my thoughts of you ever are.

I just wanted to give you a heads up ... because well, there\u2019s a story in the tabloids about Jake ... and me. And it suggests that we are ... um ... sleeping together. Which obviously we\u2019re not.\u201d</p> <p>Why did I say that?</p><p>Because you\u2019re a coward.</p><p>No, I just can\u2019t tell him this over the phone.</p><p>Will hasn\u2019t said anything, and the silence is stretching.</p><p>\u201cAre you still there?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d His tone is as stale as last week\u2019s bread. \u201cWhy do the tabloids think you\u2019re sleeping with him, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know journo\u2019s.\u201d I cringe as I say the words. \u201cJake sang this song at his show for me and they stupidly interpret it as he\u2019s serenading me. And they\u2019ve said that Jake said some stuff which he most definitely did not. Then I danced with him in the club, as I did some of the other guys in the band.\u201d A total lie. \u201cAnd then my feet were cut and hurting from my new shoes, so Jake carried me into the hotel ... and that\u2019s all,\u201d I add lamely at the end.</p><p>Silence again. I can hear him breathing down the line.</p><p>I hold my breath, nervously fingering the hem of my T-shirt.</p><p>Jake\u2019s T-shirt.</p><p>I\u2019m the worst kind of person.</p> <p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s definitely nothing for me to be worried about?\u201d he finally asks, his voice tentative, wary.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course there isn\u2019t, baby.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m evil, pure evil.</p><p>I hear him exhale. \u201cThen it doesn\u2019t matter. Don\u2019t worry yourself with it, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m just worried about you ... that it will cause you some problems. You know, stick from the guys at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Tru.\u201d His voice is soft. \u201cYou haven\u2019t done anything wrong, so who cares what the papers say, or the dickheads I work with. They\u2019ll soon get bored and move onto to something else when they realise there\u2019s nothing in it.\u201d</p><p>The bedroom opens and I glance up to see Jake standing here in all his glory, before me.</p><p>Crap.</p> <p>\u201cWill,\u201d I mouth to him, pointing my finger to the phone, which is now pressed firmly up against my ear.</p><p>His happy face drops, and he turns and goes back into the bedroom, closing the door behind him.</p><p>And I feel sicker from that one look on his face, than I have from anything I have heard and said since I woke.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re okay?\u201d I murmur to Will.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re more than okay. I\u2019m sorry, darling, but I have to go, I\u2019ve got a meeting and they\u2019re calling me in now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Go. I\u2019ll call you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cLove you too.\u201d</p><p>I hang up the phone and drop my head into my hands.</p><p>Then taking a deep breath, I get up and go to see Jake, with absolutely no clue what I\u2019m going to say to him.</p><p>He\u2019s sitting cross-legged on the bed, wearing his boxer shorts, and the TV is on. One quick glance tells me it\u2019s the Entertainment Channel.</p><p>\u201cSo we made the news,\u201d he says, gesturing to the TV with the remote. His eyebrow is raised, but I can see the wary in his glance. \u201cWas that what the phone call was about?\u201d</p><p>He says this like it\u2019s a normal thing. But then I guess to him it is.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answer, sitting down on the edge of the bed beside him. \u201cVicky called to tell me about the story, and I thought I should call Will \u2013 you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ... um ... did you tell him about us?\u201d His voice is soft from beside me.</p><p>\u201cNo! Of course not!\u201d I turn, looking at him horrified.</p><p>His face hardens, and I instantly see how bad that sounded.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realise the thought of me and you together was so bad,\u201d he bites back.</p><p>Shit, he\u2019s hurt.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I meant \u2013 I just ... it\u2019s complicated,\u201d I sigh.</p><p>He brushes my hair back over my shoulder, his fingertips skimming over the skin on my neck. \u201cAre you ever going to tell him what happened between us?\u201d</p><p>I lift my eyes to his. \u201cYes...no...I don\u2019t know,\u201d I shake my head, disconsolately. Staring down at my toes, I curl them into the carpet.</p><p>We sit in silence for a long moment.</p><p>I turn to face Jake, but he\u2019s not looking at me, his eyes are staring blankly at the TV.</p><p>\u201cI just ... I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on between you and me, Jake. I don\u2019t know what this is.\u201d I point my finger between the both of us.</p><p>He drags his eyes from the TV to mine, and he does not look happy in the least. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what this is? Sorry, was I alone in that bed last night?\u201d His eyes flick to the very spot where we had sex only hours ago.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. But this is your MO, Jake. This is just what you do.\u201d I signal to the very same spot.</p><p>He climbs up off the bed, leaving me feeling a little bereft.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I always sleep with my best friends just for the hell of it. I fuck Denny and Tom all the time.\u201d</p><p>Okay so that\u2019s pissed me off.</p><p>\u201cWell how the hell am I supposed to know what you do and don\u2019t do, Jake? What your guidelines to sex are? You generally screw anything in a skirt!\u201d My voice is raised, and I\u2019m on my feet now facing him, the bed between us.</p><p>He gives me a long, hard stare. \u201cNice, Tru. Real nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s the truth!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well that may be, but you\u2019re not just any girl. You\u2019re my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2013 I\u2019m your girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know exactly what I mean.\u201d His gaze fixes onto mine.</p><p>I lose my breath and my stomach tightens.</p><p>\u201cAnd at least I was always straight with those girls. They knew the score, I fucked them, showed them the time of their lives \u2013 they went home and I never saw them again \u2013 end of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re such an arrogant prick!\u201d I yell. \u201cAnd wait \u2013 hang on \u2013 what? You\u2019re saying I wasn\u2019t straight with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>I drag my fingers through my hair. \u201cI never said I was going to leave Will, and you never asked me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUn-fucking-believable!\u201d He picks his jeans up off the floor and starts pulling them on.</p><p>My heart is pumping hard in my chest.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Jake, just what exactly do you want from me?! You want me to leave Will so I can become your fuck buddy \u2013 your girl,\u201d I air quote. \u201cWhile writing your bio, and you get to carry on living your rock star lifestyle, screwing anything that moves!\u201d</p><p>He pauses buttoning his jeans up and he stares across at me. The stormy look in his eyes makes everything in me come to an abrupt halt.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been near anyone since you came back into my life, Tru.\u201d He runs his hand through his hair, hanging it off the back of his neck, he exhales loudly.</p><p>All I can do is stare at him, my blood heating, goose bumps racing across my skin.</p><p>\u201cYou ask what I want from you?\u201d His eyes move to my lips, then my eyes. \u201cI want you, Tru. I just want you. All day, every day.\u201d</p><p>His words are so simple, so easy.</p><p>My heart stutters.</p><p>I\u2019m stunned. I literally don\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>He wants me? I wasn\u2019t just another lay to him.</p><p>I have waited more than a decade to hear Jake say he wants me, and now, here, at quite possibly the worst time in my life he could say it ... and he\u2019s saying it, and I have no clue how to respond.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d is the best I can muster up.</p><p>\u201cI get it Tru, it was a one time thing for you, it\u2019s fine \u2013 you want to stay with Will. Why would you want me?\u201d he mutters, backing up, turning for the door.</p><p>It\u2019s clearly not fine. And he clearly doesn\u2019t get it. I\u2019m not entirely sure I do.</p><p>One thing I do know is everything has just got so much more complicated than I could have ever imagined. But a very big part of me doesn\u2019t care. Because he doesn\u2019t just want one night. Jake wants more. He wants me.</p><p>\u201cNo. Wait.\u201d I rush forward, grabbing hold of his arm, stopping him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it wrong. I thought this was just a one off for you. I didn\u2019t know this ... us ... that you wanted an ... us.\u201d</p><p>He stares down at me with his blue, blue eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s all I want.\u201d</p><p>My heart sighs and scatters across the floor.</p><p>I look up into his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted you for the last decade, Jake. I want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>He stares down at me, hope evident in his eyes. \u201cAnd Will?\u201d</p><p>Will.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to him,\u201d I swallow. \u201cWhen I go back home after the tour. I\u2019ll talk to him then.\u201d</p><p>He frowns.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it over the phone, Jake. He deserves more than that from me, and it\u2019s only five days away.\u201d</p><p>He nods, but I can see the reluctance in his agreement.</p><p>Then he takes my face in his hands and leans his mouth down to mine and kisses me. A long, slow delicious kiss.</p><p>My whole body responds to him.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re mine?\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I breathe, barely believing I\u2019m saying the words, that this is even happening.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing my T-shirt.\u201d His traces his finger over the fabric on my breast and my nipple instantly hardens. \u201cI like you in my clothes ... but I also like you out of them.\u201d He takes hold of the hem of his T-shirt, his fingers skimming my skin as he lifts it over my head, dropping it to the floor. \u201cBut I like being inside you even more,\u201d he whispers, pulling me up tight against his firm body.</p><p>He starts to kiss my neck, as he backs me up toward the bed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have any plans for today did you?\u201d he murmurs against my skin.</p><p>\u201cUm...no.\u201d Even if I did they would have been cancelled for sure.</p><p>\u201cGood. Because you\u2019re not leaving this room today, and neither am I.\u201d</p><p>He picks me up, putting me on the bed, he pulls his jeans and boxer shorts off in one, and climbs on top of me, ready for round two.</p><p>And once again, Will and my life back in the UK disappear off into the ether.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>We stayed one more night in Denmark for the gig at the Parken Stadium, and now we\u2019re in Paris for the last show of the European tour at the Stade de France, tomorrow night.</p><p>And the whole time Jake and I have been sleeping together, and when I say sleeping, we\u2019ve not done much actual sleeping.</p><p>Behind closed doors we\u2019re acting like we\u2019re a couple, and in front of others pretending like nothing is different between us.</p><p>I\u2019ve been putting on a fa\u00e7ade, acting like everything is okay to Will when I speak to him on the phone, when it\u2019s clearly not.</p><p>I know that I\u2019m the worst kind of person, but currently I just can\u2019t see past Jake.</p><p>All I see his him.</p><p>I\u2019m so completely in love, and lust with him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fortunately, the media interest in Jake and I quickly died down when Stuart put out a press release stating there was no story.</p><p>The release was firm on the point that Jake and I have a purely professional relationship.</p><p>Jake had Stuart put the statement out, and he only did that for me. If Jake had his way, the whole world would know about us.</p><p>For obvious reasons that can\u2019t happen.</p><p>But I\u2019ll be going home in a few days, after the show, and I\u2019m going to tell Will then.</p><p>I think.</p><p>Well, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve promised Jake I\u2019ll do. And I know I have to tell Will the truth, I just feel absolutely sick every single time the thought passes through my mind about telling him. So I\u2019m trying not to think about it.</p><p>Instead I\u2019m just immersing myself in Jake, as much and as often as I can.</p><p>We haven\u2019t spent a night apart since that night in Copenhagen, and honestly, I can\u2019t imagine spending a night apart from him ever again.</p><p>Every night though I have the same internal battle.</p><p>I go and call Will before bed as scheduled.</p><p>I feel sick with guilt after the call.</p><p>Jake is jealous and ansty with me when I return to him.</p><p>A part of me wants to leave Jake because of the guilt I feel over Will, the other part, the bigger part, wants to stay because of the way I feel about him.</p><p>We fight a little, sometimes a lot.</p><p>Then we spend the rest of the night making up.</p><p>Tonight, we\u2019re in my suite. The guys have all gone out.</p><p>Jake and I both made some lame excuse up for not going out so we could spend the night together.</p><p>We ordered room service, ate our fill, and are now snuggled up on the sofa. I\u2019m nestled in-between Jake\u2019s legs, head on his chest, and we\u2019re watching Armageddon.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t much on the hotels movie listing, and I like Armageddon, it\u2019s a sweet film.</p><p>Jake has been stroking my hair for the last ten minutes and I\u2019m starting to feel sleepy and content.</p><p>I must have fallen asleep on Jake, because the next thing I know, he is lifting me up off the sofa and into his arms, and the room is in darkness.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I mumble, sleepy.</p> <p>\u201cPutting you to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where are you sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you, of course.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t argue tonight. I\u2019m too tired. And I wouldn\u2019t argue any way. There\u2019s no guilt, because I haven\u2019t called Will.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>Well, I\u2019m not going to call him now. I\u2019ll just call him in the morning, tell him I fell asleep.</p><p>That\u2019s at least the truth.</p><p>And the fact is, I love sleeping with Jake.</p><p>I know it\u2019s wrong. Everything about this is wrong.</p><p>But it also feels so very right. And I don\u2019t have the energy to care about right and wrong now.</p><p>Jake lays me down in bed and pulls the duvet over me.</p><p>I hear him moving around the room, undressing and then the bed dips as he climbs in beside me.</p><p>I feel his hand reach out in the dark, and he takes hold of mine. He pulls my hand over and holds it against his warm, hard chest. I can feel his heart beating under my palm.</p><p>\u201cI love being in bed with you,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love having you in my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still tired?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cNot so much now.\u201d I stifle a yawn. \u201cWhy, what did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on?\u201d I coax, smiling.</p><p>He shifts closer to me and runs his hand up my leg. I part them as his hand moves higher.</p><p>\u201cSay something in Spanish to me,\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you sound so sexy when you do.\u201d He runs his tongue over the skin on my neck, and I shiver inside.</p><p>\u201cI do? I always thought I sounded dorky.\u201d</p><p>He lifts his head, staring at me in the darkness. \u201cDorky \u2013 are you kidding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you laughed every time I did the accent when we were kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI laughed to try and kill my hard-ons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I did it to make you laugh,\u201d I giggle.</p><p>\u201cTease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerv.\u201d I grin. \u201cSo you really like it.\u201d I push my fingers into his thick hair.</p><p>\u201cI really like it.\u201d His voice is dark and sexy. \u201cI spent most of my early adolescence with a hard-on because of you \u2013 I still do now. I can\u2019t watch a Penelope Cruz film without getting a hard on \u2013 it doesn\u2019t bode well at premieres you know. I associate all things Puerto-Rican and Spanish with hard-ons, and it\u2019s totally your fault.\u201d</p><p>I giggle again.</p><p>\u201cWhen you were teaching Stuart Spanish swearwords the other day, fuck, Tru...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoder,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d he groans. He grabs my hair, kissing me hard on the mouth.</p><p>I like this seeming sense of power I have over him.</p><p>\u201cShit, Tru, what are doing to me? It took everything in me the other night not to bend you over the table and take you right there and then in front of Stuart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you were so moody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was frustrated,\u201d he growls.</p><p>I grin in the darkness, shivers ricocheting through me.</p><p>\u201cYou should have taken me then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I won\u2019t,\u201d he says, tone serious and really hot. \u201cThe next time you speak to me in Spanish I\u2019m going to do some seriously dirty things to you and I won\u2019t care where we are.\u201d</p><p>I press my legs together and moisten my dry lips. \u201cHazme el amor,\u201d I say, trying to sound seductive.</p><p>He groans, biting down on my bottom lip, tugging it into his mouth. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake love to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, I can do.\u201d He yanks my shorts and panties down and pushes his finger deep inside me.</p><p>I gasp gripping the sheets with my hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never tire of doing this with you,\u201d he breathes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure one day you will.\u201d</p><p>He has me flat on my back and is on top of me, pinning my arms above my head before I get chance to blink.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he reaffirms. Then he starts to kiss my neck, working his way downwards, hands cupping my breasts, touching me in just the right way, like he\u2019s been doing this to me always.</p><p>And once again, I lose myself in him, basking in his glory, and the feelings only he can create in me.</p><p>Jake and I are laying facing one another in the darkness, the shine of the moonlight coming in through the huge hotel window, as we stare at each other.</p><p>\u201cDo you still dip your fries in your milkshake?\u201d he asks.</p><p>We\u2019re talking food. We\u2019ve been talking nonsense for the last hour, my tiredness faded long ago with the sex, and I\u2019m loving it. I\u2019m loving him.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I grin.</p><p>\u201cYou still know that\u2019s gross don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, but I don\u2019t care because I love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always were a weird case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDitto.\u201d I pull my tongue out at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I always pulled off the weird in me way better than you did. I made it appear cool to others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh, so I guess I should get some tips from you then on how to be the bomb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost definitely. And I\u2019ve got plenty of tips I can give to you that will raise your cool points in no time.\u201d He runs his fingertip down the length of my nose. A finger of which has just been doing all manner of naughty things to me, not short of an hour ago.</p><p>It makes me shiver inside.</p><p>\u201cHmm, I just bet you have.\u201d</p><p>A question is buzzing around in my head. The one I\u2019ve wanted to ask him since I first saw him in that hotel room for the interview.</p><p>I take a deep breath in. \u201cWhy did you stop calling and writing?\u201d</p><p>He stares at me for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cI was young and, selfish and stupid, and I hated how much I actually missed you once I\u2019d left. I didn\u2019t know it was possible to miss someone as much as I did you, then. And every time I spoke to you on the phone or got a letter from you, it hurt just that bit more. Then I met Jonny and we started up the band, and my old life \u2013 you, all just seemed so very far away. I still missed you, but the ache had started to dull and I knew if I kept in touch it would just rake all those bad feelings up, so I decided to stay away.\u201d</p><p>I run my fingertips along his jaw. He takes hold of my hand and kisses my fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever get in touch with me once the band got big?\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cFor that very reason. You\u2019d stopped calling and writing to me, and it had been so long, I didn\u2019t want you to think I was only getting in touch because you were famous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to. I thought about you often. Wondering what you were doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why didn\u2019t you find me then? It\u2019s not like you couldn\u2019t have. You\u2019ve sure got the resources.\u201d</p><p>I feel a wave of anger. If he\u2019d got in touch years ago, we\u2019d have got together then, and I would never have met Will. And I wouldn\u2019t be in the mess I\u2019m currently in.</p><p>He presses his lips together. \u201cI was afraid to.\u201d</p><p>Those four words send shivers spiralling through me.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He sighs. \u201cIn the beginning I was too absorbed in the band to care about anyone or anything. And I was mostly high \u2013 not the best person to be around at times.\u201d He pulls in a breath. \u201cThen we hit the big time and things were pretty wild. Then Jonny died, and...\u201d He pauses as if gathering composure. I can see how much it still hurts him, even now.</p><p>\u201cEverything just fell apart. Denny and Tom were a mess, and they were looking to me to somehow fix it for them. And I just didn\u2019t know how to. For a while back then, I didn\u2019t think the band would make it. Especially when I went fuckin\u2019 AWOL in Japan.\u201d</p><p>He grimaces at the memory.</p><p>\u201cYeah, pissing on the stage. Not your finest hour, but completely understandable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was one of my lower points, Tru. And then I realised that Jonny had been my glue, and then it hit me just how much he reminded me of you ... you and him were similar in so many ways. And I\u2019d relied on him, like I had you for all those years to keep things straight for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I moved to the States, the very first thing I did, without realising, was go looking for another version of you. It just happened to be Jonny,\u201d he shrugs.</p><p>\u201cAnd through all the grieving for him, all I could think about was you. But we\u2019d been apart for eleven years and I didn\u2019t know how to get in touch. I wanted to, so badly, but I just kept thinking you\u2019d moved on, and what if you didn\u2019t want to see me ... I just couldn\u2019t bear the thought of losing you all over again, so I bottled it. And when you walked in that hotel room, I just...\u201d</p><p>He runs his fingers through my long hair, brushing it over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe my luck that it was you. Stuart had given me the list with the interviewer\u2019s names on that morning, and there was yours, right at the top. I spent the next hour pacing the floor, hoping it would be you, and then there you were, standing before me, looking the most beautiful you ever had, and I knew with absolute certainty I was never letting you go again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I push my lips together, scrunching my brow. \u201cSo that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing the bio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartly,\u201d he half-smiles. \u201cBut mainly because you are a fan-fucking-tastic writer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood save.\u201d I smile and lean close to him, kissing him gently on his lips.</p><p>He grabs my face, keeping me there. \u201cDon\u2019t ever leave me, Tru.

I wish I had gotten the chance to know Jonny.

I bask in his contentment, feeling it like it\u2019s my own, as I breathe him in.</p><p>\u201cWho was your first girlfriend?\u201d I ask, tracing my finger over the tattoo on his chest.</p><p>I know he never had one back in the UK. So she was definitely an American.</p><p>I hate that I don\u2019t know this stuff about him.</p><p>\u201cAside from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was never your girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have been.\u201d He opens his eyes and stares into mine. I\u2019m surprised at the intensity of his gaze. \u201cBut to answer your question, little Miss Interviewer,\u201d he grins, moving back. \u201cI\u2019ve never had one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never had a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.

I\u2019m being completely serious.\u201d His eyes are steady on mine.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I just find it a little hard to believe \u2013 Jake Wethers has never had a girlfriend \u2013 what about all the models and actresses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you see any pictures of me with them for any longer than a week?\u201d</p><p>I rake through my memories, cringing at the images that flash through my mind of Jake with other women.</p><p>I shake my head, no.</p><p>Wanting to change the subject, I say, \u201cOkay, seeing as though I\u2019m in interviewer mode, I want to ask \u2013 if you, Jake Wethers, had to pick one song as your title song to describe yourself, what would it be \u2013 and it can\u2019t be one of your own,\u201d I quickly add.</p><p>\u201cHurt,\u201d he answers without hesitation.</p><p>It makes me hurt inside he picked that song.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He lets out a light sigh. \u201cSome people said Reznor was writing a lyrical suicide note, others said he was writing about finding a reason to live. I think it\u2019s both ... it just depends on which side you\u2019re looking at it from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd which side are you looking at it from?\u201d</p><p>He stares at me from a long moment. My heart is hammering in my chest.</p><p>\u201cNow? ... a reason to live.\u201d</p><p>My insides start to tremble.</p><p>\u201cReznor\u2019s version or Johnny Cash\u2019s?\u201d I ask quietly, trying to conceal the pain from my voice.</p><p>\u201cJohnny Cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He closes his eyes briefly. And in this moment I just want to magic up all the power in the world to soothe his pains away.</p><p>\u201cBecause I have a few things in common with him,\u201d he answers, opening his eyes.</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe drugs ... the women ... hanging out for the girl of my dreams.\u201d</p><p>I take a sharp breath in. Tears instantly prick the backs of my eyes.</p><p>He touches my face, his thumb smoothing over my lips. \u201cYou\u2019re my June, Tru.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>\u201cExcept I can\u2019t sing,\u201d I say trying to make light of the moment.</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah there is that, but you can play a mean tune on the piano.\u201d</p><p>I tilt my head to the side, forcing a smile I don\u2019t really feel.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s yours?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cOh, without a doubt, I Can\u2019t Get No Satisfaction.\u201d I push the smile into grin trying to take us back to moments ago.</p><p>\u201cDo I detect a hint of sarcasm there, Bennett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d I press my lips together.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll just have to see what I can do about that.\u201d Then he\u2019s flipping me over onto my back and kissing my neck.</p><p>\u201cJake?\u201d I say after a moment.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he murmurs, running his tongue over my skin.</p><p>\u201cWhy have you never settled with anyone for longer than a week?\u201d</p><p>He lifts his head and stares down at me with such an intensity it makes my insides ache.</p><p>\u201cBecause I was waiting for you.\u201d He tucks my hair behind my ear and kisses me gently on the lips.</p><p>\u201cI just wondered if it was because of your past ... you know \u2013 your dad?\u201d I ask tentatively. \u201cWhy you\u2019re afraid to have a relationship.\u201d</p><p>I feel him stiffen under my hands, and I know I\u2019ve said the wrong thing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of having a relationship.\u201d He sits up abruptly leaving me cold. \u201cI\u2019m trying to have a relationship with you, but you seem to be having a pretty fuckin\u2019 hard time letting go of your current one. You asked before if I\u2019ve ever had a girlfriend \u2013 no. But you don\u2019t ask if I want one. Because I do \u2013 you. I want you in my life all the time. I want to be able to go out with you in public and tell everyone that you\u2019re my girl, without hiding here in these fuckin\u2019 hotel rooms, while you decide if you want me or him.\u201d</p><p>Whoa! What the hell?! How did we get here?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you I want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t told Will, and therein lies the problem, Tru. Because really, I don\u2019t think you do know what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>I sit up and take his face in my hands, forcing him to look at me. \u201cI want you. I want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>And in this moment I mean those words. I do want Jake. But I know I love Will too, and honestly, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to feel when I see him again.</p><p>The truth is, being here with Jake, like this, it\u2019s easy because I just feel so far away from Will. Far away from my life with him.</p><p>Like him and I was a different lifetime ago.</p><p>But when he steps back into it ... I guess I just don\u2019t know.</p><p>Still, no matter how I feel, I will do the right thing. I will tell Will about me and Jake. I just have to find the right moment.</p><p>I move my mouth close to Jake\u2019s, but instead of kissing his lips, I dip my head and kiss the scar on his chin, pressing my lips gently to it.</p><p>He sharps in a breath.</p><p>I run my tongue over his rough stubble, upwards, until my mouth finds his.</p><p>He grabs a hand full of my hair, holding me to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, Tru. I\u2019m not sharing you with him anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours,\u201d I murmur into his mouth.</p><p>I just feel so utterly intoxicated by him, and in this moment I am his, completely.</p><p>Jake pushes me back onto the bed, grabs a condom from the nightstand and has it on in moments.</p><p>He slides himself inside me, no hesitation. I groan as I feel him fill me completely, like only he can.</p><p>He kisses me hard on the mouth, and then rolls onto his back taking me with him, putting me on top.</p><p>I start to move slowly, up and down, my hands placed on his toned stomach.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Tru,\u201d he groans, his fingers digging into my hips, as he lifts his, meeting me, pushing himself deeper inside.</p><p>\u201cI want to,\u201d I breathe, meeting his eyes, biting down on my lip.</p><p>Jake has me on my back again, in one swift move, taking my breath with it.</p><p>And then things get urgent and heated, and hard.</p><p>I\u2019m hips up, meeting his thrusts, hands splayed on his back, fingers digging into his muscle, gripping him, while Jake fucks me like I want him to.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Jake,\u201d I moan. \u201cHarder. I want it harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll tell him about us tomorrow.\u201d He slams into me, his teeth gritted. He\u2019s not asking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him.\u201d I\u2019d say anything right now if it means he\u2019ll keep doing this with me \u2013 to me.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t share you anymore,\u201d he repeats, as he continues driving into me over and over again. \u201cYou belong to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I cry out.</p><p>When we find our release together, Jake holds me tight to him, his face buried in my neck. Almost like it\u2019s the last time he\u2019s going to hold me.</p><p>And I lay here, confused, trembling on the inside from the intensity of it all. Of the intensity of his feelings for me.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t realised they were so deep. Or that Jake was quite so possessive.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>I wake to the sound of knocking on my hotel door. A glance at the clock tells me it\u2019s 9.15am.</p><p>I wonder who the hell that is?</p><p>Jake is wrapped around me like a sheet. I disentangle myself from him. He groans and rolls over in his sleep.</p><p>I pull my robe on and pad my way toward the main door. I peer through the peep hole, and my heart stops in my chest.</p><p>It\u2019s Will.</p><p>Will is standing outside my door, and Simone is with him, and Jake is in my bed \u2013 holy fuck!</p><p>Holy fucking fuckety shit!</p><p>For a moment, I literally don\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>Then Will knocks at the door again. A little louder this time.</p><p>I take a couple of quiet steps back, then turning I run into the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cJake,\u201d I whisper, shaking him. \u201cWake up.\u201d</p><p>He blinks open heavy eyes.</p><p>\u201cWill is here, outside the door! Here now!\u201d I hiss.</p><p>He blinks again as my words register. Then very slowly, he sits up.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t look panicked in the least. Me, I\u2019m absolutely shitting myself, but Jake seems quiet leisurely about it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve have to hide.\u201d I pull on his arm, glancing around the room, my eye catching sight of the bathroom door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHide. You need to hide in the bathroom. Will is here outside the door.\u201d</p><p>I run around gathering up his clothes. I shove them in his arms, and try to pull him off the bed. He\u2019s reluctance is apparent.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to hide in the fuckin\u2019 bathroom?\u201d His tone is less than encouraging.</p> <p>\u201cSsh, keep your voice down, he\u2019ll hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck,\u201d he says audible.</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Jake. I can\u2019t let him find out this way. Not when he\u2019s come all this way to see me. I will tell him, soon. But not like this. Please.\u201d I try to urge him off toward the bathroom again.</p><p>Another knock. Louder, more insistent this time.</p> <p>Jake glances in the direction of the knocking, then looks back to me giving me a hard, unforgiving stare.</p><p>I stare back with pleading eyes.</p><p>He gets to his feet and storms in the bathroom, shutting the door firmly behind him.</p><p>My head is an absolute mess.</p><p>I quickly make my way toward the door. Smoothing my hair down, I take a deep breath, then swing the door open.</p><p>\u201cSurprise!\u201d Will and Simone sing in unison.</p> <p>\u201cArghh!\u201d I cry out in fake-Oscar-worthy-surprise.</p><p>Will throws his arms around me, enveloping me into a big hug.</p><p>His scent washes over me, musky and minty, and I almost break down crying on the spot.</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019ve missed you,\u201d he says, holding me tight.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too,\u201d I murmur. I can\u2019t stop the tears that fill my eyes.</p><p>Guilty tears.</p><p>\u201cYou took your time answering the door.\u201d He holds me back, looking at me like he\u2019s drinking me in.</p><p>He looks so happy.</p> <p>Oh God.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I was sleeping.\u201d I somehow manage to get the words out of my clotted throat.</p><p>\u201cA late one huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>Simone pushes her way in hugging me. I wrap my arms around her.</p><p>I\u2019m so glad she\u2019s here.</p><p>Will moves past us, wheeling their little suitcases into my suite.</p><p>\u201cHey, gorgeous,\u201d she says. \u201cThe flat has been so quiet, and so clean without you.\u201d</p><p>I hug her tighter.</p><p>\u201cHey, you okay?\u201d She holds me back appraising me with her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just happy to see you.\u201d I hug her again.</p><p>Releasing her, I follow Will into the living room, Simone behind me.</p><p>Okay, so Jake is trapped in the bathroom, and I somehow have to get them out of here for a little while, so he can get of there and back to his own suite.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d Simone exclaims from behind me. \u201cThis place is huge.\u201d</p><p>I shrug, smiling through tight lips.</p><p>My eyes keep flickering in the direction of the bathroom door.</p><p>Jake is in there. In the bathroom. Wearing just his boxer shorts. I hope he\u2019s dressed into his clothes.</p><p>Not that it will make the slightest bit of difference if Will finds him trapped in my bathroom. It\u2019ll be pretty clear what he\u2019s doing in there.</p><p>Fuck. Fuck. Fuckety fuck.</p><p>What am I going to do?</p><p>After setting down the suitcases, Will comes back over to me and wraps his arms around my waist and plants a kiss firmly on my lips.</p><p>I squirm a little.</p><p>I wonder if he\u2019ll be able to smell Jake on me? Freeing myself from his kiss, I lean back away slightly.</p><p>He stares down at my face. \u201cAre you okay, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d My voice is a little strangled, and I\u2019m dying under his gaze. I feel like I\u2019m going to crack any minute.</p><p>\u201cThis is okay isn\u2019t it? Simone and I turning up to surprise you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is!\u201d</p><p>Simone is wandering around checking the place out.</p><p>\u201cThis bedroom is massive!\u201d she exclaims, poking her head through the door.</p><p>Don\u2019t go in there. Please don\u2019t go in there.</p><p>She\u2019s gone in.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>I can see her over Will\u2019s shoulder moving around, checking things out, looking at the view through the window, which is right next to the bathroom door.</p><p>Don\u2019t go in the bathroom. Don\u2019t go in the bathroom.</p><p>I see her hand reaching for the door handle.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>What am I going to do? I\u2019m trying to think quickly, but I\u2019m frozen. Nothing\u2019s working. Every function in me failing right when I need it most.</p><p>Then everything slips into slow motion, and I freeze solid in Will arms as I watch in absolute horror, as Simone pulls open the bathroom door.</p><p>\u201cARGHH!\u201d she screams.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Bollocks.</p><p>\u201cSimone are you okay?\u201d Will asks, concerned, turning in my arms.</p><p>I keep a firm hold of him.</p><p>This is it. This is the exact moment that everything is over.</p><p>If I\u2019d have known this was going to be the last time I held Will, then I\u2019d have held him with a lot more conviction. I\u2019d have taken in everything about him. Because when he finds out Jake is in there, he\u2019s never going to forgive me. He\u2019ll never look at me the same again.</p><p>Simone is silent for what seems like forever. I tentatively hold my breath, waiting for her response, feeling like my head may explode any second.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d she hollers, but her voice sounds a little strangled.</p><p>Then I hear the bathroom door close.</p><p>I exhale.</p><p>\u201cIt was just a spider. A massive spider in the bath. Frightened the shit out of me,\u201d she says, coming back into living room.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to get rid of it?\u201d Will asks, turning in my arms.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Both Simone and I say in unison.</p><p>Will looks between the two of us puzzled.</p><p>\u201cI like spiders,\u201d I say quickly.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Will focuses his inquisitive stare onto me.</p><p>I instantly heat under his gaze.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gone. It bolted when I screamed at it,\u201d Simone tells him, saving me from his quizzical stare.</p><p>I meet her eyes briefly. One, slow blink, thanking her.</p><p>She nods gently, and sits down on the arm of the sofa.</p><p>\u201cSo how did you know what room I was in?\u201d I ask, releasing myself from Will\u2019s hold, but he keeps his arm around my waist, keeping me close.</p><p>Will answers, \u201cWell, we wanted it to be a surprise, and we figured you\u2019d be up on the top floor, so we asked the security guy who was out by the main door guarding it, I\u2019m guessing Jake\u2019s security people \u2013 who looked none too pleased to see us up here might I add, but then we told him we were looking for you, that we\u2019d come to surprise you and he showed us to your room.\u201d</p><p>It worked I was surprised. And so completely screwed. Literally and figuratively.</p><p>\u201cGood thinking.\u201d I force a smile. \u201cSo when did you decide on this?\u201d My voice is wobbling all over the place.</p><p>I need to get them out of here, just long enough so I can get Jake out of the bathroom. It\u2019s the only current working thought in my mind.</p><p>\u201cA few days ago.\u201d Will leaves my side and sits down on the sofa.</p><p>Crap, he\u2019s getting comfortable.</p><p>I stay where I am. I can\u2019t seem to stand still. I\u2018m practically hopping from one foot to the other.</p><p>I wrap my arms across my chest.</p><p>Simone keeps flickering glances my way, but I can\u2019t bring myself to look at her. The shame is burning up my face.</p><p>\u201cI knew you were stressed about the whole Jake affair article,\u201d Will says.</p><p>I nearly choke on my own spit, quickly turning it into a cough, I cover my traitorous mouth with my hand.</p><p>Will doesn\u2019t seem to notice and continues on regardless, \u201cAnd I know today is the last day of the tour so I thought I would come out and watch the gig \u2013 if that\u2019s okay with Jake and the guys obviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m sure it will be.\u201d My voice is so squeaky.</p><p>This is just getting worse and worse.</p><p>\u201cSo well, I called up Simone to see if she fancied coming too, and here we are.\u201d</p><p>He was being thoughtful. And I was sleeping with Jake.</p><p>I\u2019m going to Hell. Straight to Hell.</p><p>\u201cI got us seats on the same flight back as yours tomorrow night so we can all fly home together,\u201d he adds, smiling.</p><p>\u201cSounds wonderful.\u201d I force a smile. \u201cSo I bet you guys must be starving,\u201d my voice lifts. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go downstairs and get some breakfast, the food here is amazing. I\u2019ll just get dressed and I\u2019ll meet you down there in ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I could do with something,\u201d Will says, putting his hand to his stomach. \u201cBut we\u2019ll wait for you, darling ... go get changed.\u201d He tips his head in the direction of the bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cI need to shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine we\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>I flick a \u2018help me\u2019 glance at Simone.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be waiting bloody ages Will, you know what\u2019s she\u2019s like and I\u2019m starving. Let\u2019s go down now and get a table, and Tru can join us once she\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Will says hesitantly.</p><p>He gets to his feet and comes over to me, tipping my chin up with his thumb and forefinger, he plants a kiss firmly on my lips.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see you down there, and don\u2019t be long. I\u2019ve been away from you too much already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ten minutes max.\u201d</p><p>Simone squeezes my hand on the way past. I almost break down on the spot.</p><p>I wait until I hear the door close behind them before I move.</p><p>I go into the bedroom, and slowly open the bathroom door.</p><p>Jake is sitting on the edge of the bath, dressed in his clothes, and he doesn\u2019t look happy. But then I didn\u2019t expect he would be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry...\u201d I start, but he cuts me off.</p><p>\u201cDid you know he was coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I look at him surprised.</p><p>He gives me a look of disbelief.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, as if I\u2019d have you here in my bed if I knew he was coming.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me for a long moment. My stomach is knotted and my body wired. I can\u2019t stop fidgeting.</p><p>I go over to him, kneeling down between his legs. \u201cI am so very sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you make me hide in here?\u201d</p><p>I give him a puzzled look. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want him to walk in and find you in my bed.\u201d</p><p>He narrows his gaze at me. I feel hot and uncomfortable under it.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not going to tell him about us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Yes, of course I am.\u201d</p><p>I think. Maybe. I don\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cSo go tell him.\u201d He gestures towards the door with his hand. \u201cYou know where he is. Go tell him now. I\u2019ll wait here for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake...\u201d I get up off the floor, sitting on the toilet. \u201cHe\u2019s flown all this way to see me. I can\u2019t just go and tell him about you and me ten minutes after he\u2019s arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promised me last night that you would tell him. He\u2019s here now so what better opportunity is there. You didn\u2019t want to tell him on the phone \u2013 well now you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>I run my hands through my hair and blow out a breath. \u201cBe reasonable, Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve been pretty reasonable overall, and patient. So very fuckin\u2019 patient, but it\u2019s wearing thin.\u201d</p><p>I look down at my toes.</p><p>He sighs loudly, then gets up and storms out of the bathroom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m quick to my feet, following after him.</p><p>\u201cJake, wait,\u201d I call.</p><p>He stops just shy of the bedroom door, and turns back to face me. \u201cWill you tell him today or not?\u201d</p><p>I let out a light breath, wrapping my arms around myself. \u201cI will tell him, but I can\u2019t today,\u201d I shake my head. \u201cNot today.

It\u2019s the last show of the European tour and he is making sure they finish on a high.</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen Jake since this morning. He\u2019s avoiding me for obvious reasons.</p><p>I know it\u2019s hurting him Will being here, and I hate it. I can\u2019t stand the thought of Jake being in pain in general, but when it\u2019s because of me it\u2019s a thousand times worse.</p><p>I wish I could make it better for him. But right now I feel like I\u2019m caught between a rock \u2013 Jake \u2013 and a hard place \u2013 Will.</p><p>For a change, I\u2019m out front watching the show with Will and Simone. I thought it would be better than stage side for obvious reasons, and Stuart very kindly sorted me out some fantastic seats for the three of us.</p><p>We\u2019re seated close to the stage with a clear view of the guys, and well maybe saying seated is wrong because Simone and I haven\u2019t sat down since the show started.</p><p>It\u2019s hard not to fall into the pull of the show, because Jake and the guys are on fire.</p><p>I\u2019m just glad I wore my floral print cami top and blue denim skirt as it\u2019s crazy hot in here tonight.</p><p>And I don\u2019t think the heat is helping with my wrecking ball nerves, but then I\u2019ve been this way all day.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to keep thoughts of what happened this morning out of my head and to focus on Will, but it\u2019s difficult, especially here now looking at Jake, looking so beautiful up on the stage.</p><p>Jake finishes up singing one of the new hits, \u2018Pure Thing\u2019 and slows things down to an easy stop.</p><p>The stage darkens. The lights killed.</p><p>There\u2019s some whistles from the audience, but it\u2019s so silent that you could hear the beating heart of a mouse.</p><p>I find myself holding my breath along with everyone else.</p><p>Then the spotlight hits Jake.</p><p>He looks like a God up there. So beautiful with the world at his feet.</p><p>Eighty thousand people and not a single sound to be heard. The stadium waiting, breath baited, to hear what will come out of Jake\u2019s mouth.</p><p>A man with the adoration of the world at his feet, and in this moment I can\u2019t exactly figure why he wants me.</p><p>Jake steps back from the mike and pulls his cigarettes from out of his back pocket, puts one between his lips, and lights it up.</p><p>Blowing the smoke from his mouth, he reaches down and grabs his bottle of beer from the side of his mike stand, taking a long swig from the bottle.</p><p>Garnering cheers from the crowd, encouraging him to down the bottle, even Tom is egging him on, so Jake being Jake downs the bottle and tosses it to the ground in front of the stage, as the crowd cheers.</p><p>I can tell he\u2019s already been drinking a lot, that\u2019s apparent enough.</p><p>He takes another drag of his cigarette and steps up to the mike.</p><p>The whole stadium is silent, once again, in anticipation of what Jake will say next.</p><p>He exhales his smoke as he leans into the mike, and starts to speak, \u201cOkay,\u201d he runs his hand through his hair, looking contemplative. \u201cI know the guys are going to kill me for this ... but I\u2019m thinking of maybe mixing things up a bit, doing something a little different.\u201d Jake leans back from his mike, looking at Tom with a question on his face, covering his mike with his smoking hand.</p><p>Tom wanders over to him, bass in hand. Jake says something in his ear. Tom looks up surprised, then nods once, at Jake.</p><p>Tom heads back to Denny, climbing up, leaning over the drum kit, he says something to him. I see Denny look over at Jake, a puzzled look on his face. Jake lifts his shoulders, grinning.</p><p>The room is abuzz, the crowd wondering just what\u2019s going on.</p><p>Tom jumps down from the kit and goes over and speaks to Smith.</p><p>Smith looks across at Jake and gives him a quick nod.</p><p>Tom walks back past Jake, putting his hand on his shoulder, he speaks briefly in his ear. I see Jake laugh, as Tom walks away.</p><p>Jake looks back out at the crowd. \u201cOkay folks, sorry about that.\u201d His beautiful voice echoes around the stadium. \u201cWe\u2019re going for a song change, but one I think you guys will dig. We\u2019re doing something a little different \u2013 it\u2019s not one of ours. This song was out around the time that we were breaking into the music scene, and these were guys we admired \u2013 still do. It\u2019s a personal favourite of mine.\u201d</p><p>He takes another drag of cigarette.</p><p>\u201cSo all you ladies out there ... no, actually guys too, how many of you have had your heart broken?\u201d</p><p>Every hand in the whole place goes up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had my heart broken too, believe it or not, quite recently in fact,\u201d he says.</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll mend it for you, Jake!\u201d cries a female voice from the audience.</p><p>Jake chuckles into the mike. \u201cI might have to take you up on that, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay when and where, and I\u2019ll be there baby!\u201d yells the woman.</p><p>Then a collection of female voices all start screaming, vying for Jake\u2019s attention.</p><p>My throat is starting to get tight. I\u2019m nervous and on edge, to know where he\u2019s going with this. I know he can be unpredictable at times, especially when he\u2019s been drinking.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he lifts his hand quietening the crowd. \u201cSo tell me out of all those broken hearts, how many of them was because your guy or girl cheated on you?\u201d</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>Some of the hands go down.</p><p>\u201cBad shit, huh?\u201d he says into the mike.</p><p>\u201cOkay...\u201d He takes another drag of his cigarette and drops it to the floor, putting it out with his boot. \u201cHow many of these hands up, have ever in their time, been ... a cheater too?\u201d</p><p>My heart drops through the floor. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s doing this in front of eighty thousand people.</p><p>A huge majority of the hands go down. I bind my together in front of me.</p><p>I sneak a glance at Will, but he\u2019s watching the show.</p><p>I can\u2019t even look at Simone. I haven\u2019t really had chance to talk to her about Jake. I gave her a brief overview while Will was in the toilet, but catching Jake in the bathroom attached to my bedroom, told her all she needed to know.</p><p>She\u2019s not judging, and I love her for that, but she did say I need to make a decision. And she\u2019s right, I do.</p><p>I\u2019m just not fully sure on which decision to make.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well this song is for all of you who have been cheated on,\u201d Jake continues. \u201cAnd also for the ones they cheated with. The ones of you who were used and abused, filled with a shit load of promises, then left hanging dry. This one is for you guys...\u201d</p><p>Denny hits the cymbals twice, Smith kicks in with the guitar, and Jake leans into the mike and starts to sing.</p><p>My whole body freezes cold, as he lullaby\u2019s the lyrics to The Killers, \u2018Mr Brightside\u2019.</p><p>Holy fuck.</p><p>So he\u2019s not only just talked about adultery in front of eighty thousand people, he\u2019s now singing about it.</p><p>Singing about a guy who believes his girlfriend is having an affair.</p><p>He\u2019s trying to tell Will. He\u2019s trying to get Will thinking.</p><p>And in this moment, I\u2019m filled with absolute anger toward Jake.</p><p>Then, as if reading my thoughts, he tilts his head to the side, staring straight in my direction, I didn\u2019t realise he even knew where I was sitting.</p><p>I thought I at least had some anonymity.</p><p>Apparently not.</p><p>Now I\u2019m standing here, open wide to whatever he chooses to throw at me. And I can\u2019t move, I\u2019m paralysed, as he openly sings in my direction.</p><p>Anger burns through me, turning to rage and fear.</p><p>He\u2019s no right to do this. It\u2019s up to me to tell Will, in my own time. It\u2019s just cruel playing shitty games like this.</p><p>I\u2019m just praying on the fact that Will doesn\u2019t get music like we do. He doesn\u2019t read the messages in lyrics.</p><p>I want to look at Will, I need to know if he\u2019s seeing this or I\u2019m right, like I\u2019m praying and he doesn\u2019t.</p><p>But I can\u2019t move because I\u2019m trapped in Jake\u2019s stare. Like a rabbit in the headlights of a very beautiful truck, careening its way toward me.</p><p>I\u2019m so very afraid at the game he\u2019s playing, and I get a distinct feeling this is just the start of tonight\u2019s games.</p><p>And when Jake does finally release me from his gaze, singing back to his adoring fans, I steal a glance at Will, and find he\u2019s just watching the stage, completely oblivious as to what has just transpired up there.</p><p>Then I feel Simone\u2019s hand take hold of mine.</p><p>I turn my head to look at her. She gives me a sad smile, then rests her head against my shoulder, as the song finally comes to an end. Jake finishing my first torture of the night</p><p>And I keep hold of her hand for the rest of the show.</p><p>After the show, I head straight to the after show party with Will and Simone. Ben had kindly offered to drive us, so we ride through the streets of Paris in his safe hands. He drops up off out front, with the offer to pick us up later, but I wave his kind gesture off and tell him to get back to the hotel and chill out for the night.</p><p>Showing my pass to the security we\u2019re waved in.</p><p>We quickly grab a table, and I ensure it\u2019s one with a good view of the door, so I can see when Jake arrives. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Will goes to the bar to get us some drinks. The party is buzzing already. But all I can think about is Jake. When is he going to get here? And what kind of mood will he be in when he does arrive?</p><p>\u201cSo the show was great,\u201d Simone enthuses. \u201cA little crazy in parts.\u201d She raises her eyebrow and I know exactly what she\u2019s getting at.</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cIs Jake always that ... intense?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot generally, but with me, recently ... yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, when he started talking about all the cheating stuff, then he started singing Mr Brightside, I nearly died for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I did die.\u201d I give her a weak smile.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s definitely got it bad for you, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d I lift my shoulders. \u201cI think maybe it\u2019s just because currently, I\u2019m the one thing he can\u2019t have.\u201d</p> <p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s more than that. He wouldn\u2019t put himself out there on the line like that if it was just for a conquest. I\u2019m pretty sure there are others things out there for Jake to conquest if he wanted.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, and mostly that\u2019s what I\u2019m worried about.</p><p>I see movement in the door, distracting me.</p><p>Denny walks in with Stuart. But no sign of Jake or Tom.</p><p>Where is he? Wouldn\u2019t they come together? They usually do, but then I\u2019ve been with them on those occasions.</p><p>Odd though because Stuart is always with Jake. I wonder why he\u2019s sent him on with Denny?</p> <p>People stop Denny, congratulating him on the show. Stuart spies me and comes over to our table.</p><p>\u201cHello my gorgeous chica\u201d He kisses me on the cheek. \u201cOh, and another gorgeous.\u201d He kisses Simone. She flushes scarlet.</p><p>\u201cAre all you Brit chicks gorgeous, or just the ones Tru knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll British girls are hot \u2013 especially the half-Puerto Rican and foxy blonde ones.\u201d I grin at him.</p><p>\u201cWell, if the men are anything near as good looking as your hot boyfriend then I\u2019m flying over now,\u201d he says to us, grinning, setting both Simone and I laughing.</p><p>Even though I\u2019m laughing, all I want to do is ask Stuart where Jake is. But I can\u2019t. It might look to obvious.</p><p>Denny finally makes it to our table, and drops down into the seat next to Simone. I see her instantly tense up.</p><p>\u201cHey, Tru,\u201d he smiles.</p> <p>\u201cDenny this is my best friend and roommate, Simone,\u201d I introduce.</p><p>\u201cGreat to meet you,\u201d Denny turns, looking at Simone for the first time, and I see his eyes widen the instant he looks at her.</p><p>I\u2019m not surprised, she is absolutely gorgeous.</p><p>I see her eyes are already lit up like a Christmas tree over Denny. You\u2019d have to be blind not to notice the obvious, instant attraction.</p><p>Oh, I have a good feeling about this</p><p>I smile to myself as Denny starts to talk to Simone; happy that at least out of the two of us, one of us is currently happy.</p><p>Will comes back with our drinks. A margarita for me. He knows me so well.</p><p>I take a sip, the fresh alcohol kick is perfect. My drinks from the gig were starting to wear off.</p><p>\u201cSorry guys, I didn\u2019t realise you were here otherwise I\u2019d have got you some drinks in,\u201d Will says to Stuart and Denny.</p><p>\u201cHey, no problem, man,\u201d Denny says, waving him off.</p><p>\u201cOh, Denny, this is my boyfriend, Will.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why but it suddenly feels odd referring to Will as my boyfriend to Denny.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, man.\u201d Denny shakes Will\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cYou too,\u201d Will says, politely. \u201cGreat show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to the bar,\u201d Stuart starts to get to his feet, but Denny gets up. \u201cSit down, man, I\u2019ll get these \u2013 beer?\u201d he asks Stuart.</p><p>\u201cBeer\u2019s good,\u201d Stuart replies, sitting back down.</p><p>Denny heads over to the bar, and Stuart starts talking to Will about the show.</p><p>I lean across the table to Simone. \u201cSo Denny...\u201d I raise my eyebrows at her.</p><p>She flushes red. It\u2019s so cute to see. I haven\u2019t seen her like this about a guy for a long while.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s even better looking in the flesh,\u201d she whispers, shyly.</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d I agree. \u201cAnd he\u2019s a really great guy. He was in a long term relationship, but they broke up about a year ago and he\u2019s been single ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo basically he\u2019s not a womaniser like the other two?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s my turn to flush. \u201cUm ... yes.\u201d</p><p>She grimaces. \u201cSorry that sounded\u2013\u201d</p><p>I flash my eyes in Will\u2019 direction, cutting her off.</p><p>She presses her lips together, apologising with her eyes.</p><p>I sit back in my chair and give her a light, forgiving smile. But it feels heavy on my face and I can\u2019t hold it for long.</p><p>Denny comes back with his and Stuart\u2019s drinks, taking Simone\u2019s attention again. And I glad because I just can\u2019t seem to muster up any conversation with anyone. My mind is far too busy working overtime, wondering where Jake is, what he\u2019s up too and who with.</p><p>If he was with Denny I wouldn\u2019t be worried. But he\u2019s with Tom, and Tom\u2019s ... well, he\u2019s exactly the same as Jake, when it comes to women. A complete slag.</p><p>And the fact that Denny is here without them, meaning he left them to whatever they were doing so he could come to the party, as he isn\u2019t into the whole shagging thousands of women thing, isn\u2019t looking good right now.</p><p>What if Jake is with some groupie who managed to scam her way backstage? Or even worse ... with some gorgeous French model or actress who was a VIP at the show.</p><p>Jake\u2019s blatantly angry with me because Will is here, so maybe he\u2019s decided to forget all about me with the help of someone else.</p><p>I start to feel sick, so I pick my margarita up and get chugging on it, trying to kill all thoughts of Jake.</p><p>We\u2019ve been here an hour, the drink is not soothing me and I\u2019m getting ansty, because Jake and Tom are still no shows.</p><p>Simone and Denny are getting on a treat which is awesome. I\u2019ve picked up my conversational skills with Will and Stuart some, but not by much, I\u2019m more pretending to listen than actually listening.</p><p>My eyes are surreptitiously trained on the door, and person after person, I\u2019m met with disappointment that it\u2019s not Jake walking through those doors.</p><p>I don\u2019t even know if he\u2019ll even speak to me when he does arrive. Or maybe he won\u2019t come because I\u2019m here with Will.</p><p>No, it\u2019s the aftershow party for the final leg of the European tour, a big deal and there are a lot of important people here. Jake\u2019s a businessman as well as a musician, he\u2019ll show.</p><p>I\u2019m getting the urge to want to call him. I keep considering it over and over in my mind whether or not to go to the bathroom and call him.</p><p>I\u2019m on my second margarita, and trying to pace myself for the night, as I feel it will more than likely be a long one. And counting the drinks I had at the show, I\u2019m three glasses of wine and two margaritas in already.</p><p>Denny has gone to the bar, Simone accompanying under the pretence of helping him carry the drinks back. She just wanted to get him alone, and I can\u2019t say I blame her.</p><p>Stuart and Will are talking cars now, so I open up my handbag on the table and check my phone for the tenth time to see if Jake has called or text me, but there\u2019s nothing but a blank screen staring back at me.</p><p>I\u2019m turning into a crazy person over him. Is he doing this to me on purpose? Knowing him, yes, quite probably.</p><p>But I have to know whether he\u2019s coming tonight or not.</p><p>I decide to go to the bathroom to call him, and I\u2019m just about to get up from my seat, when I hear the noise that always accompanies Jake, as he comes into the party with Tom. Dave and Ben are obviously with them, and there\u2019s a group of people I don\u2019t recognise also.</p><p>Rapturous applause breaks out, the masses encroaching on Jake. And in this moment I feel incredibly proud of him as all eyes in the room are focussed solely on him.</p><p>I\u2019m so relieved to see him that I think the huge smile on my face might split my cheeks in half.</p><p>But my relief doesn\u2019t last long, and I see as the crowd shifts, standing beside Jake, is a very beautiful girl, with long thick red hair, a huge cleavage and legs that go on forever, wearing a dress that shows them off to their max. She looks like model.</p><p>And Jake is holding her hand.</p><p>My gut empties hollow, the smile quickly falling from my face, as it starts to prickle.</p><p>And therein I instantly get my answer as to where, and who he\u2019s been with for the last hour.</p><p>A thousand thoughts and emotions stream through me.</p><p>None of them good.</p><p>I feel sick and stupid, dizzy and my heart is physically hurting in my chest.</p><p>My legs are itching to take me up from this chair and running for the door and out of here, and far, far away.</p><p>But I don\u2019t move. I just sit here, rooted with pain, as I watch Jake with this girl.</p><p>I see his eyes scan the room. They lock onto mine. I freeze for a long moment, while his eyes burn me.</p><p>I look away. It\u2019s too hard to look at him for another moment longer, as thoughts whip through my mind as to what he\u2019s been doing with her.</p><p>I wonder if that is what it\u2019s like for him when I\u2019m with Will.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019s with her, to hurt me. Well, if it is, it\u2019s working, and well.</p><p>I\u2019m raw with jealousy. I didn\u2019t know I had it in me to feel it to this level.</p><p>With my trembling hand, I finger the steam of my glass, picking it up I tip my head back, letting the margarita run down my throat.</p><p>As I move my eyes downwards, resting my glass back on the table, I\u2019m met with Jake. He\u2019s standing at our table, directly in front of me, his redhead in tow.</p><p>He\u2019s not holding her hand anymore, I notice. Even still, it doesn\u2019t make me feel any better.</p><p>I just feel angry with him, and jealous. So very jealous.</p><p>And for a second, I wish I was sitting next to Will and not Stuart, so I could hurt Jake like he\u2019s hurting me. But then it would be a little strange if I leaned over Stuart to get to Will.</p><p>More like obvious, and childish, I\u2019d say.</p><p>I force composure on myself.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Denny?\u201d Jake asks Stuart.</p><p>He\u2019s ignoring me. It hurts.</p><p>\u201cThe bar.\u201d Stuart points in Denny\u2019s direction.</p><p>Seeing Denny with Simone, Jake grins and nods his head in approval.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Will,\u201d Will says to Jake, getting to his feet. \u201cTru\u2019s boyfriend. We haven\u2019t had a chance to meet yet.\u201d Will holds his hand out to Jake.</p><p>Jake glances down at his hand like he\u2019s not sure what to do with it.</p><p>And for that long second everything seems to hang in the air, precariously balancing.</p><p>Then Jake takes his hand and shakes it. \u201cGood to finally meet you. Tru\u2019s told me a lot about you.\u201d</p><p>Jake casts a glance in my direction. It tears right through me.</p><p>\u201cAll good I hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Jake lightly shrugs his shoulders, taking his hand back.</p><p>I let the breath out I was holding.</p><p>\u201cThe show was amazing,\u201d Will continues, sitting back down. \u201cAnd I thought your version of Mr Brightside was bloody brilliant \u2013 better than the original.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nearly crack into pieces on the spot.</p><p>Jake\u2019s eyes flicker in my direction again, and he smirks. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake, are we getting a drink?\u201d Redhead pulls on his arm. Her voice is sweet, laced with a heavy French accent, and she pronounces Jake \u2013 Zzhake, rolling his name around her tongue.</p><p>It sounds as sexy as she looks. I hate her.</p> <p>Why do the French always sound sexy? So much sexier than my Spanish accent, the one that turns Jake on.</p><p>Fine, he wants to play games, well I\u2019m up for that.</p><p>\u201cYeah, in a minute,\u201d Jake answers her sounding irritated.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to introduce us to your new friend, Jake?\u201d Stuart asks.</p><p>Jake narrows a gaze at Stuart, who seems unfazed by the darts he\u2019s shooting him down with.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think I want to know her name. It somehow makes her even more real if she has a name.</p><p>Jake glances back at redhead. \u201cUm ... yeah, this is ... um.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes at him. \u201cI\u2019m Juliette.\u201d She presses her small hand to her large chest.</p><p>Zzhuliette.</p><p>So not only is she beautiful, she has a beautiful name. Which, Jake either couldn\u2019t remember or hadn\u2019t even bothered to find out.</p><p>I don\u2019t even know if that should make me feel better or not.</p> <p>\u201cZzhuliette,\u201d I hear myself saying in a really bad French accent.</p><p>Jake\u2019s eyes flicker to mine.

And I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the booze or a mild hysteria setting in, but I say, in bad French again, \u201cZzhake and Zzhuilette. Has quiet a ring to it. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d I stare at Jake.</p><p>He shifts on his feet, looking at me like I\u2019ve just grown another head.</p><p>I know Will\u2019s staring at me too, but in this moment I don\u2019t care.</p><p>Jake laughs, getting his cool composure back. \u201cWhat have you been drinking, Tru?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, just a few margarita\u2019s.\u201d I stare at him steady, shrugging, forcing the best smile I can muster up. \u201cI\u2019m just feeling happy.

Will and Simone are here, it\u2019s all good, I\u2019m happy, happy, happy!\u201d</p> <p>His eyes harden, burning into mine. \u201cSo what did you think of the show, Tru?\u201d</p><p>Is he asking my professional opinion or asking me in my current state of anger with him? Honestly, I don\u2019t even know why he is asking. And hearing him say my name, it\u2019s like I\u2019m hearing it for the first time.</p><p>How can this be the same man who made love to me all through the night. Told me how much he missed me for the years we\u2019d been apart. The man who pleaded with me to never leave him.</p><p>\u201cTrooo?\u201d Zzhuilette looks at me puzzled, with bitch in her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re name is Trooo?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never wanted to slap someone as much as I do her now.</p><p>Take my guy \u2013 fine. Don\u2019t dis my name. Even though I just did yours a few moments ago \u2013 kind of.</p><p>\u201cTrudy,\u201d I explain. \u201cMy friends call me Tru for short.\u201d I emphasise the \u2018u\u2019.</p><p>\u201cAhh, I zee.\u201d She runs her fingernails through her hair seemingly bored now.</p><p>Obviously she has the attention span of a gnat.</p><p>Ugh, I\u2019m turning into one of those bitchy women. Good.</p><p>I pick my margarita up and take a mouthful for courage.</p><p>\u201cAnd to answer your question, Jake,\u201d I start to speak in my Spanish accent, because I know how much it affects him, and I want to be a bitch.</p><p>Jake\u2019s eyes widen and fire, and I know I\u2019m playing a dangerous game. I dare not even look at Will.</p><p>\u201cIn my professional opinion the show was brilliant, one of your best to date.\u201d I smile sweetly up at him, desperately trying to hold the pieces of me together.</p><p>His flaming eyes soften, slightly. I see him shift uncomfortably in his pants.</p><p>He\u2019s squirming.</p><p>Good.</p><p>Or maybe I\u2019ve just turned him on and am about to send him off with his redheaded groupie.</p><p>Smart, Tru, real smart.</p><p>\u201cGlad you think so. Plenty for the bio?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Work. He really wants to talk work with me. Fine.</p><p>\u201cYes, plenty of stuff.\u201d</p><p>Barring the, \u2018I\u2019m having an affair with you\u2019 part of the show, which you are now clearly past, as you have a shiny new French toy to play with.</p><p>I bite my lip, until it hurts.</p><p>Tom comes swaggering over, a couple of girls in tow.</p><p>\u201cWhere the fuck is Denny? Are we getting this party started or what?\u201d he says loudly, clearly already drunk, slapping Jake on the back.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m coming now,\u201d Jake answers him, without moving his eyes from mine.</p><p>Jake casts his eyes around the table, landing back on me lastly, and says, \u201cHave a good night.\u201d</p><p>Then he\u2019s walking away, over to the bar, with his long-legged French redheaded beauty, Zzhuilette.</p><p>Leaving little ordinary English, Trudy, to watch him from the side-line, like everyone else in this room.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>I\u2019ve been surreptitiously watching Jake since he walked away from me thirty minutes ago.</p><p>I\u2019m aware of every single move he makes, my eyes tracking him around the room, watching him greet people who are clearly here just to see him, as I force an interest in what Will has to say.</p><p>I know I\u2019m not being fair to Will. But I just can\u2019t seem to get my focus straight anymore.</p><p>Jealousy and anger are in my driving seat.</p><p>Jake hasn\u2019t looked in my direction once in all that time. And now he\u2019s seated at his table, in the smoking area of this place, with Tom and Smith, and hordes of groupies hanging around them, and of course the leggy Zzhuilette.</p><p>I had thought at one point, while he was working the room, he\u2019d binned her off, as she was nowhere to be seen, but the second he sat down, she was there again. And my temporary sense of relief was gone.</p><p>While Will is talking to Stuart, I sneak another peek across the room, just in time to watch as Zzhuilette leans across the table, her cleavage well on show for all to see, mainly Jake, with an unlit cigarette perched between her glossy pink lips.</p><p>Jake pulls his lighter from his pocket, sparking it, he holds it up to her cigarette.</p><p>She puts her hand on his wrist, touching his friendship bracelet, my bracelet, holding his hand in place and bats her eyelashes seductively at him as she puffs her cigarette lit.</p><p>I\u2019m angry that he let her touch my bracelet. I know that sounds stupid, but I\u2019m not exactly feeling rational right now.</p><p>She moves back into her seat in a cloud of smoke, pushing her chest out, crossing her long legs suggestively at him.</p><p>She\u2019s the kind of sexy that I could only dream to be.</p><p>She is beautiful and I feel suitably inadequate. She is Jake\u2019s type for sure. His equal.</p><p>I really don\u2019t know what it is he sees in me. Or maybe I\u2019m just a conquest like I said to Simone, because of our history. And the unobtainable, because of Will.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s why he wants me so much.</p><p>Or maybe not so much now as the case may be.</p><p>As I\u2019m staring, I see Jake\u2019s eyes flicker past Zzhuilette and straight in my direction. I quickly look away, staring down at my drink.</p><p>I can\u2019t do this. I need a breather.</p><p>Getting up from my seat, I say to Will, \u201cI\u2019m just going to the ladies.\u201d</p><p>I grab my bag and as I\u2019m walking past, Will catches my hand.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, darling?\u201d he asks in a quiet voice, looking up at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cYou just seem a bit quiet, not your usual self.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s noticed. I really am not being fair to him at all. He flew all this way to see me and I\u2019m just visually chasing Jake around this room.</p><p>I\u2019m going to go to the bathroom to sort myself out, and come back out and focus all my attention on Will, just like he deserves.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, baby, honestly.\u201d I touch his face with my hand. \u201cI just think maybe all this travelling with the tour has finally caught up with me. I\u2019m not used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll be home tomorrow night for a few weeks break, so you can relax then. And I\u2019ll be there to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>I feel sick at his kind words. I\u2019m the lowest of the low. How could I cheat on this wonderful man?</p><p>Because you love Jake.</p><p>I push the thought to the back of my mind.</p><p>\u201cSounds wonderful,\u201d I say.</p><p>He kisses my hand, then releases it and turns back to Stuart, resuming their conversation.</p><p>I cross the huge room on unsteady legs, feeling like they might give out on me any moment now. Forcing a calm I don\u2019t own, I hold my head up high and carry on forward.</p><p>I see Simone is still at the bar with Denny, deep in conversation. Catching her eye, I give her a mini thumbs up. She grins happily at me.</p><p>I\u2019m just opening the bathroom door, when someone grabs me from behind and drives me into the empty bathroom.</p><p>As I turn, surprised, I see it\u2019s Jake.</p><p>He locks the door behind him and leans back against it. His eyes look like they are on fire.</p><p>Something in my stomach drops, then coils lower. My legs start to tremble.</p><p>I\u2019m ecstatic he\u2019s followed me here, and angry too.</p><p>Then my whole body catches up with my legs, and the tremble runs from my head, back down to my toes, tightening me up in those special places. The places only Jake can somehow magically touch with one single look alone.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I say, going with my anger. \u201cSomeone might have seen you come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one saw me.\u201d He sounds confident, assured. Like always.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how true that statement is. Eyes are always on Jake wherever he goes.</p><p>\u201cGreat performance tonight \u2013 Mr Brightside \u2013 really Jake? Why not just spell it out to the whole world,\u201d I bite.</p><p>He shrugs, grinning.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I ask, rattled by his calm demeanour.</p><p>He lifts his eyebrow. \u201cYou.\u201d He starts to move slowly toward me like a tiger stalking its prey.</p><p>\u201cJake, no ... not here, not now. Someone could come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDave\u2019s outside the door and it\u2019s locked. No one will bother us.\u201d</p><p>So Dave knows I\u2019m sleeping with Jake? Brilliant.</p><p>\u201cNo, Jake. Please,\u201d I beg, as he moves closer.</p><p>I\u2019m begging because I don\u2019t know if I have the ability to say no to him. I haven\u2019t so far.</p><p>When I see he\u2019s got no intention of listening to my pleas, I start to back up and quickly find myself up against the sinks, with nowhere left to go.</p><p>My whole body is rushed with adrenaline, want and fear. It\u2019s a heady combination.</p><p>When he reaches me, I put my trembling hand out, pressing it flat against his hard chest, stopping him at arm\u2019s length.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful tonight,\u201d he whispers intense, eyes fixed on mine.</p><p>The exhilaration of being in here with him, him taking control like this, is doing crazy things to me.</p><p>He pushes hard against my hand and I\u2019m weakened to stop him, and truthfully, I don\u2019t want to.</p><p>The second I saw him with that girl, I hated it, and I wanted to reclaim him as mine.</p><p>So when he grabs hold of my hair, fisting his hand into it, and crushes his mouth to mine, I don\u2019t stop him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What is it about him that makes me lose all reason and sense? What is it about Jake that turns me into a person I don\u2019t want to be, don\u2019t even like at times, yet makes me feel so completely and utterly alive like I\u2019ve never before known.</p><p>His tongue invades my mouth, claiming me his. I wind my fingers into his hair.</p><p>He tastes of sweat and whiskey and cigarettes ... everything Jake.</p><p>With his hands cupped around my backside, he picks me up and sits me on the edge of the sink. I wrap my legs around his, holding him to me.</p> <p>\u201cI want you so bad,\u201d he groans into my mouth.</p><p>My hands go under his T-shirt. He stops kissing me, and pulls it off over his head.</p><p>I drink him in. All I want is him. I don\u2019t care about anything else right now, but having Jake.</p><p>He grabs my hair again, pulling my head back, looking into my eyes. \u201cTell me you want me.\u201d His tone is commanding, possessive.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d I breathe, my voice trembling.</p> <p>He grins, then covers my mouth with his, pushing his hips firmly against me.</p><p>He\u2019s hard already. The feel of him, like this, sends waves of intense sensation rushing through my body.</p><p>Jake drags his hand from my hair, down over my breast. He breaks from kissing me to pull my cami off over my head, leaving me in my bra. That\u2019s gone a few seconds later.</p><p>He bends, putting his mouth around my nipple, sucking hard.</p><p>I groan at the feeling. I reach forward and undo his jeans, freeing him. I wrap my hand around him, working him up further.</p><p>He moans over my skin, moving his mouth to my other breast, kissing every part.</p> <p>Jake grabs hold of my thigh, lifting my leg to the side, his hand moves to my skirt. He drives it up, then his hand continues, higher, his mouth clamped on mine, kissing me harder and harder.</p><p>My legs are still trembling from the lust and the danger of it all. Anyone could catch us in here.</p><p>Jake hooks his fingers under my panties and pushes his finger inside me, then without hesitation, another.</p><p>I arch my back, pushing into his hand, my head falling back.</p><p>\u201cAhh,\u201d I moan, as his fingers move inside me.</p><p>In this moment, I\u2019m his completely, whatever he wants me to do, I will.</p><p>\u201cI want you now,\u201d he growls.</p><p>\u201cYes, now.\u201d</p> <p>Then before I realise, he\u2019s tearing my panties in two, putting a condom on, and pushing himself inside me.</p><p>I\u2019m so accustomed to his size, that when he slides his hand under my thigh, pulling me closer, lifting my leg higher, hooking it on his hip, giving him full access, I move willingly.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Jake,\u201d I moan.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it baby,\u201d he breathes, briefly closing his eyes. \u201cFeel me inside you. I\u2019m hard like this for you only.\u201d</p><p>I curl my fingers around the edge of the sink, holding on as Jake takes me here on it.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d he groans into my ear. \u201cI fuckin\u2019 need you so much.\u201d</p><p>I hold my legs tighter around him, bringing him even deeper inside me.</p><p>And I realise in this exact moment, just how much I love this man. Completely.</p><p>I\u2019m addicted to him. And he\u2019s an addiction I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to give up.</p><p>He\u2019s grabbing at my flesh, driving into me, making love to me, and I\u2019m so turned on, so close to coming, that when he groans, \u201cCome for me, baby.\u201d I instantly do.</p><p>He follows, and we climax together.</p><p>I\u2019m all sensation as Jake kisses me deeply, his tongue invading my mouth, my body tightening all around him.</p><p>For a long few seconds, we stay locked together, Jake\u2019s arms around me.</p><p>Then I come down from my Jake high with a hard bang.</p><p>Will.</p><p>What have I done?</p><p>I push him aside, sliding down off the sink on to my wobbly legs. I retrieve my bra and cami off the floor, quickly putting them on, seeing my torn panties on the floor.</p><p>Fuck!</p><p>How the hell am I going to explain to Will why I\u2019m not wearing any underwear?</p><p>Angry with Jake, I pick them up off the floor and throw them at him.</p><p>He catches them, holding them up in his hand, he stares at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck were you thinking?\u201d I hiss. \u201cRipping my panties off \u2013 Jesus Christ, Jake! What the hell am I going to tell Will?\u201d</p><p>He removes his condom, binning it, zips his pants up, bends down and retrieves his T-shirt pulling it back on. Then he stares back at me with narrowed eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat was I thinking? I was thinking about wanting you. I don\u2019t really give a shit what you tell Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ!\u201d I repeat, putting my hands to my head, trying to sort through my tangled thoughts.</p><p>No, it\u2019ll be okay, I\u2019ll just tell Will that I came out without any panties on. Not that I\u2019ve ever done it in the past, but I can make out it was a sexy thing for him.</p><p>The very thought makes me feel sick.</p><p>How can I be thinking sexy stuff with Will when I\u2019ve just had sex with Jake?</p><p>This is so very screwed up.</p><p>I stare at him, my underwear still in his hand. \u201cGive them to me,\u201d I say, holding my hand out.</p><p>He smirks at me. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive them back.\u201d I keep my voice low, but my tone firm.</p><p>Jake pushes my torn panties deep into his pocket. \u201cCome and get them.\u201d He tilts his head to the side, challenging me.</p><p>I don\u2019t have time for this. I have to get back out there to Will, he\u2019ll be wondering where I am.</p><p>\u201cKeep them,\u201d I say, turning for the door. \u201cI haven\u2019t got time for your games.\u201d</p><p>Jake catches hold of my hand from behind. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d There\u2019s a quiet desperation to his voice.</p><p>\u201cWhere do think I\u2019m going?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m angry with him for coming in here, disgusted with myself for being unable to say no. Angry for what I\u2019ve just done here, in this bathroom, with him.</p><p>But what\u2019s worse is I feel angry at myself because I wanted it. I wanted him more than I can ever begin to explain.</p><p>He steps closer, taking my face in his hands. I try to move. I don\u2019t want to look at him right now, because it will mean having to face what I\u2019ve done, but he forces my face to his.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he says, firmly.</p><p>I pull my eyes to his.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go to him, Tru, please.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry ... I have to.\u201d</p><p>He rubs his thumb gently over my skin. I\u2019m lost to his touch again. I close my eyes, revelling in the feel of his skin on mine.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. Just go out there and tell him the truth, baby,\u201d he says, voice low, soft. \u201cTell him you\u2019re with me now ... then we can get out of here. Just you and me. We can go anywhere in the world you want.\u201d</p><p>I flick open my eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous! I can\u2019t just tell him right here and now that I\u2019ve been screwing you \u2013 that I\u2019ve just screwed you in here, and then just bugger off with you! It doesn\u2019t work like, Jake! Not everything in life is as easy as you seem to think it is! I can\u2019t do that to him. He deserves better than that from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t?\u201d He drags his hand through my hair, pulling my head back, so I\u2019m forced to look up into his eyes. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing here, Tru \u2013 just screwing? I thought it was a lot more than that.\u201d He sounds hurt, angry, bitter.</p><p>He\u2019s every right to.</p><p>But I\u2019ve been drinking and I just can\u2019t see straight at the moment. I\u2019m so confused. My head is just an absolute clusterfuck of a mess.</p><p>\u201cCurrently, screwing is all that seems to be on your mind. This isn\u2019t about me. I don\u2019t think it ever has been ... and all this, in here was just because your ego was hurt, so you came in here looking for a quick fuck to make yourself feel better. To get one over on Will.\u201d</p><p>He looks like I\u2019ve just slapped him. He drops his hand from my hair and steps back.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear you saying no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I should have. Can\u2019t you see what we\u2019ve just done in here was wrong \u2013 what we\u2019ve been doing is wrong?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou regret me?\u201d He looks hurt.</p><p>It hurts me to see his pain.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I rub my face, pulling in a deep breath. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t regret you, I just ... I don\u2019t know.\u201d I shake my head, frustrated.</p><p>\u201cWell seeing as though you don\u2019t know, why don\u2019t I just make this easy for you.\u201d He turns to leave.</p><p>\u201cNo, Jake, please.\u201d I grab his arm, looking into his face despairingly. \u201cI\u2019m just so confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I know what I want \u2013 you. I want to be out there, with you, as mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be doing just fine with Juliette keeping you company. She looked to be soothing your pain right away from what I saw.\u201d</p><p>It just slipped out.</p><p>I know I have no right to be jealous, my current situation pending, and I hate to show my hand to him, but it was out before I could stop it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re jealous? Seriously, Tru?\u201d I see the smirk in his eyes, and that just fuels my anger right back up.</p><p>\u201cJust fuck off back to your tart!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to fuckin\u2019 go back to her. I want you.\u201d</p><p>Then suddenly I just want to hurt him.</p><p>\u201cWell you can\u2019t have me. Not tonight. Not for a while. I\u2019m going home tomorrow, remember.\u201d I let go of his arm.</p><p>I see the pain flicker over his beautiful face, and I feel sick. And all I want to do is take the words back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I start talking quickly. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that \u2013 I just \u2013 I will tell him, Jake, soon. It\u2019s just difficult, and the constant pressure from you is driving me crazy. I feel like I can\u2019t breathe. You just need to give me space and let me do this in my own time.\u201d</p><p>But I can tell I\u2019ve already lost him.</p><p>\u201cYou want space \u2013 you\u2019ve got it. Shit loads of it.\u201d He turns from me again, and stalks away, heading for the door, then stops just before it, turns and marches back until he\u2019s close to my face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the other guy, Tru. It doesn\u2019t fit with me \u2013 who I am. I\u2019m the guy. And if you\u2019re saying you can\u2019t give me that now, then ...\u201d He leaves his words hanging.</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d My voice is trembling.</p><p>Saying nothing more, he turns from me and walks away.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me!\u201d I cry after him. \u201cThen what, Jake? You\u2019re done? What?!\u201d</p><p>I can feel panic rising in me. I\u2019m losing him completely.</p><p>He stops and turns marginally, his lips pressed together in a tight line. \u201cInterpret it whichever way you want. I don\u2019t give a shit anymore.\u201d</p><p>He unlocks the door, and stalks out of the bathroom slamming the door behind him.</p><p>I look at myself in the mirror. In this moment, right now, I hate myself.</p><p>Gripping hold of the sink, I try to control the shakes convulsing through me.</p><p>Then I throw up.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>\u201cYou were gone ages,\u201d Will says.</p><p>I smooth my skirt down as I sit in my seat, acutely aware of the fact that I have no panties on.</p><p>\u201cSorry. The queue for the toilet was really long, and when I was in there, I felt a little sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d His brow furrows with concern. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Concern I really do not deserve.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine.

I can go to the bar and get you some water if you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine \u2013 honestly,\u201d I add at Will\u2019s worried expression.</p><p>What I need right now is alcohol and lots of it. I take a deep gulp of my margarita.</p><p>Stuart catches my eye and gives me a knowing look, lifting his eyebrow.</p> <p>He knows I\u2019m sleeping with Jake.</p><p>Of course he does. Dave knows so it makes sense he does.</p><p>I\u2019ve spent the last five days holed up with Jake. And Stuart is his PA. He knows Jake\u2019s itinerary, his every movement. It\u2019s his job to.</p><p>I bet he thinks I\u2019m a complete slut.</p><p>My cheeks burn with shame.</p><p>I glance across the room, past Stuart, and see Jake is with Zzhuilette again.</p> <p>I get a twisted feeling in my stomach.</p><p>She\u2019s sitting in his lap and they\u2019re sharing a cigarette. She puts it in his mouth, holding it to his lips while he takes a drag. Touching his lips with her fingers.</p><p>Lips that were on mine minutes before. Kissing me, everywhere.</p><p>She transfers the cigarette to her own lips and takes a long, sultry drag. Leaning close, she blows the smoke into Jake\u2019s mouth.</p><p>I feel a flash of white hot jealously streak through me, as I see that his hand is on her thigh, his other stroking her arm, intimately.</p><p>I have a flash of memory, his hands on me, touching me.</p><p>Then I watch as Jake releases the used smoke from his mouth, and leans in and whispers something in her ear. She throws her head back and laughs.</p><p>How can he do this when he was just in there with me? How can he move on so quickly?</p> <p>He\u2019s sitting there with her in his lap, and my torn panties in his pocket.</p><p>I feel sick.</p><p>He catches my eye.</p><p>Don\u2019t kiss her. Please don\u2019t kiss her.</p><p>Then with clear defiance on his face, he grabs hold of the back of her head, and plants his mouth on hers.</p><p>I almost vomit into my drink.</p><p>How could he do this? He was having sex with me less than ten minutes ago and now he\u2019s out here kissing another woman.</p><p>I know I\u2019m no angel in this, but I would never have come back out here, after been with him in there, and stuck my tongue down Will\u2019s throat.</p><p>Hot tears burn the backs of my eyes. I have the urge to run.</p><p>But where to? And it\u2019s not like I can just run off anyway. Will would wonder what the hell was wrong with me.</p><p>I\u2019m trapped here, doomed to watch, while Jake kisses another woman, minutes after having sex with me.</p><p>Deep breaths, Tru. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s all going to be okay.</p><p>Closing my eyes, shutting them out, I pick my margarita up and drain the glass.</p><p>But I have to look again. It\u2019s torture, but I can\u2019t help myself.</p><p>I open my eyes to see Jake\u2019s no longer kissing her; he\u2019s talking to Tom, who also has a groupie hanging off him. But Zzhuilette is still in Jake\u2019s lap. Her hands are on him.</p><p>I hate her, and I hate him.</p><p>No I don\u2019t, I love him. But I want to hate him. In this moment it\u2019s all I want. It would make all of this so much easier if I did.</p><p>Because this is Jake. This is what he does. It\u2019s what he\u2019s famous for.</p><p>He never gave a shit about being with me. I\u2019m just a challenge to him. Something to conquer. He would have got bored with me the instant he took me off Will, and would have tossed me aside like all the rest of them.</p><p>Jake can have his pick of women. There\u2019s not one single reason why he would have wanted me as his forever.</p><p>And I\u2019m seeing the evidence clear, now, before me.</p><p>\u201cAnother drink, darling?\u201d Will\u2019s already on his feet, gesturing to my empty glass.</p><p>He\u2019s so attentive. I don\u2019t deserve him.</p><p>I do love him.</p><p>But I love Jake. More. I think. I don\u2019t know.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>\u201cShots!\u201d I blurt out.</p><p>Will gives me a puzzled look.</p><p>\u201cOoh, I\u2019m down for shots,\u201d Stuart chips in, grinning, tapping his fingers on the table.</p><p>I think I\u2019ve just found my drinking soul mate for the evening, seeing as though Simone has abandoned me for the gorgeous, sweet Denny.</p><p>Why can\u2019t Jake be more like Denny?</p><p>\u201cA round of tequila shots please, baby ... oh, and a beer chaser and another margarita \u2013 Stuart?\u201d I look at him with a question.</p><p>He looks back at me impressed.</p><p>Well if I have to spend the night watching Jake maul a leggy redhead not long after having sex with me, then I\u2019m going to do it drunk.</p><p>Stuart looks up at Will, and says, \u201cI\u2019ll have what the lovely Tru is having, oh and make sure to put it on Jake\u2019s tab.\u201d</p><p>He winks at me.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Good. I\u2019ll be back in a minute,\u201d Will mutters still looking slightly perplexed.</p><p>I know he thinks I\u2019ve lost it. He probably thinks I\u2019m spending too much time around musicians. He\u2019s right I am. But not in the way he thinks. My problem is I\u2019ve been spending way too much time with one musician in particular \u2013 in the very blackest sense of the word.</p><p>But right now, I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s either get drunk, or go ass-over-backwards crazy.</p><p>I opt for drunk.</p><p>And I\u2019m kind of loving Stuart right now for supporting me in my alcohol binge, and for spending Jake\u2019s money in the process of helping me do it.</p><p>I watch Will go over to the bar. Anything to keep my wandering eyes off Jake and Zzhuilette.</p><p>I see Simone is still perched at the bar, her and Denny deep in conversation, totally engrossed with each other.</p><p>I\u2019m glad for her. Denny is a cool guy.</p><p>\u201cYou hanging in there, gorgeous?\u201d Stuart asks me, bringing my attention around to him. \u201cOr do you want me to go kick his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I\u2019m confused.</p><p>\u201cJake.\u201d He raises his eyebrows at me.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I lean my head into my hand, and glance over at him. \u201cAm I that transparent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But he is.\u201d He tilts his head back in Jake\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t say anything to anyone ... Will.\u201d</p><p>He gives me an, \u2018as if I would\u2019 look.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I utter quietly.</p><p>\u201cTru, I don\u2019t like to stick my nose in other people\u2019s business ... but look, gorgeous, Jake\u2019s not only my boss, he\u2019s my friend, and I\u2019ve known him a long time \u2013 I live with the guy. And basically, the idiot is crazy about you. I have never seen him, with anyone, the way he is with you.\u201d</p><p>I look at him surprised by his words.</p><p>\u201cExcept for when he\u2019s sticking his tongue down the throat of a leggy redhead,\u201d I add, trying to muster up a smile.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t work.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let that bother you, honey. That\u2019s just Jake trying to prove a point to you and himself. Trying to prove you don\u2019t matter to him as much as he knows you do. It\u2019s not going so well, as you can see. He doesn\u2019t do hurt well, so he\u2019s trying to hurt you to make himself feel better. He\u2019s all about the pain that one.\u201d</p><p>He leans closer to me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not used to this, gorgeous. Women don\u2019t play with Jake. He plays with them. He uses them as he sees fit and then tosses them aside when\u2019s he\u2019s had enough. It\u2019s what he\u2019s done since I\u2019ve been with him, and long before that I imagine. It\u2019s all he knows how to do. I can\u2019t even begin to tell you how many women I\u2019ve drove home, consoled, fielded calls from, had to arrange restraining orders against ... anyway, I digress,\u201d he says at my pained expression. \u201cBasically, since you arrived back in his life he\u2019s changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t.\u201d I shake my head.</p><p>He touches my arm, briefly. \u201cHe has, chica. He was living in his own world, floating along in his overly large, Jake bubble, screwing anything with a pulse, and then you came back into his life and I saw the instant change in him. From that day in the hotel, when he saw you, he\u2019s been different. No screwing around. He\u2019s like a freakin\u2019 Catholic priest \u2013 minus the boys,\u201d he chuckles.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t screw around, because he finds himself not wanting to, because he can\u2019t get you out of his head. It\u2019s an alien concept for him, sweetheart. He\u2019s ten-shades of crazy about you, which I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s already realised \u2013 add in to that you have a boyfriend you won\u2019t give up for him ... and this is the result.\u201d He waves his hand over his shoulder in Jake\u2019s general direction, leaning back in his chair. \u201cHe\u2019s met his equal in you that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that, and it\u2019s not that I won\u2019t give Will up,\u201d I whisper. \u201cThere\u2019s just\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever a right time, honey, I know. There never is when it comes to breaking someone\u2019s heart. But you will have to break one of those boys\u2019 hearts, and I\u2019d say sooner rather than later. But I figure you already know that. And Jake, well he\u2019ll regret whatever continuing performance he puts on tonight \u2013 tomorrow. Remember honey, he\u2019s a man, and with men you just you have to treat them like the children they are.\u201d</p><p>I raise my brow at him. \u201cYou\u2019re a man...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I\u2019m the best kind of man, my gorgeous-one, I\u2019m Venus and Mars.\u201d He winks at me.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but laugh, even though inside I\u2019m in complete and utter agony.</p><p>Then one of my favourite dance songs comes on.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna dance?\u201d I ask to Stuart, getting to my feet, holding my hand out to him.</p><p>I refuse to sit here wallowing for a moment longer. I want to forget, and dancing will make me forget.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking a gay guy if he wants to dance? Is the Pope celibate \u2013 actually no don\u2019t answer that.\u201d He gets to his feet and takes hold of my hand. \u201cIt will be my absolute pleasure to grind on that dance floor with the hottest chica here tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, now you\u2019re definitely just being Mars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he grins.</p><p>I catch Will\u2019s eye at the bar and indicate to him that Stuart and I are hitting the dance floor. He gives me a brief nod.</p><p>Stuart leads me onto the dance floor by the hand. I instantly start to relax.</p><p>I leave behind thoughts of Jake and Will, and complicated relationships at the edge of this dance floor, and lose myself in my one true love. Music.</p><p>And hell, I thought Jake could move \u2013 Stuart would knock him on his ass in a dance-off, and Jake being knocked on his ass is something I would take great pleasure in watching right now.</p><p>Stuart is moving around the floor like a pro and I actually look like I know what I\u2019m doing thanks to his awesomeness. Not that I\u2019m a bad dancer, but Stuart is dynamite.</p><p>I wonder if he ever used to dance professionally?</p><p>We are starting to attract quite a few stares. And I can see Jake watching us from his table. Zzhuilette is off his lap for the time being, thank god. She\u2019s probably plumping up her cleavage in the toilet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The toilet I had sex with Jake in.</p><p>I feel sick.</p><p>Then I catch Jake\u2019s eye, and for that brief moment my heart stop its beat.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t look happy. He looks angry.</p> <p>I look away.</p><p>He can\u2019t be annoyed that I\u2019m dancing with Stuart, surely? One \u2013 Stuart\u2019s gay. And two \u2013 he\u2019s just had his tongue stuck down another woman\u2019s throat.</p><p>The thought turns my stomach. I shut the image out of my mind.</p><p>You know what? I hope it is pissing him off. Right now I want to hurt him, and I\u2019m going to do just that.</p><p>I throw my arms around Stuart\u2019s neck and moving close to his body, I dance into him.</p> <p>As we move around, I see Tom look at me, then lean across and say something in Jake\u2019s ear.</p><p>Jake nods his head without taking his eyes off me.</p><p>My cheeks start to burn. It\u2019s awful knowing I\u2019m being talked about, but no clue as to what\u2019s being said.</p><p>Does Tom know about us? Seems like everyone else does, so why not Tom too, he is one of Jake\u2019s closest friends after all, him and Denny both.</p><p>Jake pulls a cigarette out of his pack and lights up. Then throws back his glass of whiskey, and refills it from the bottle on the table.</p><p>\u201cA girl who can dance \u2013 finally!\u201d Stuart cheers, pulling my attention back to him, grabbing hold of my hips. \u201cI\u2019ve found my Ginger! Tru, seriously, if you had less tits and more cock, I\u2019d be proposing marriage to you right now!\u201d He spins me around.</p> <p>\u201cIt can always be arranged,\u201d I laugh. \u201cMarry me?\u201d I hold out my hand dramatically to him.</p><p>He grabs it and yanks me back to his chest. \u201cVegas tomorrow, baby. I\u2019ll be the one in white at the Elvis chapel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d I wink at him.</p><p>We both start laughing, as he starts to move me around the floor again.</p><p>I like Stuart. He\u2019s so much fun, and so uncomplicated and as hot as hell. He could give Jake a run for his money in those stakes.</p><p>Why isn\u2019t he straight?</p><p>Actually no, my life is complicated enough as it is without trying to add another guy into the picture.</p><p>\u201cOur favourite rock star is not happy that I\u2019m grinding with you on the dance floor,\u201d he whispers in my ear.</p> <p>\u201cRight now, I\u2019m having way too much fun to care whatever Jake is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAtta girl!\u201d He smacks my behind with his hand, and I squeal with laughter, as he spins me around and presses his chest up against my back.</p><p>Bending his knees into mine, taking me down slowly with him, and then back up.</p><p>Dancing with me just like Jake did in the club.</p><p>The first night we slept together.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh, here comes the trouble now,\u201d Stuart whispers in my ear.</p><p>I flicker my eyes in Jake\u2019s direction and see he is on his feet, stubbing his cigarette out in the ashtray, has a seriously pissed off look on his face, eyes fixed on me and Stuart, and is now heading straight for us.</p><p>My stomach flips over.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019ve pushed it too far? No, he was just giving mouth to mouth to his little groupie before. I\u2019m doing nothing wrong.</p><p>But what if he causes a scene in front of Will?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, gorgeous, I can handle Jake, it\u2019s my job \u2013 remember?\u201d Stuart whispers, seeing my worried expression. \u201cHe won\u2019t cause a scene, I promise you.\u201d</p><p>I want to believe that, but Jake can be irrational.</p><p>When he reaches us, his face is stony. I think he\u2019s going to chew me out here and now, but ignoring me, he turns to Stuart.</p><p>He leans in and whispers something in Stuart\u2019s ear, while I stand here like a spare part.</p><p>Stuart puts his hand on Jake\u2019s shoulder, saying something back to him. I wish I could hear their exchange.</p><p>Jake\u2019s expression tightens. Whatever Stuart said, Jake didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>Stuart turns to me, giving me a warm smile. \u201cI gotta go work for a little while, gorgeous. Always on the clock.\u201d He winks at me. \u201cWe\u2019ll finish this dance later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d I smile.</p><p>I start to walk away, going the opposite direction to Stuart, heading back to our table, but Jake catches hold of my hand, pulling me back. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>I yank my hand free. \u201cWell you just got rid of my dance partner, so now I\u2019m going to drink myself into next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I come with you?\u201d</p><p>I press my lips together and stare him.</p><p>\u201cDance with me.\u201d He holds his hand out.</p><p>\u201cYeah, because that worked out so well for me the last time I did. And where\u2019s your redhead anyway? Won\u2019t she want to dance with you?\u201d</p><p>Withdrawing his hand, he stares down at me. \u201cShe\u2019s not mine, I told you, there\u2019s only one girl I want to be mine.\u201d</p><p>My skin aches on my suddenly tired bones.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to have staked a fairly certain claim on her earlier.\u201d I\u2019m trying to come off as nonchalant, but the truth is, it\u2019s hurting like a bitch.</p><p>I want to call him out for kissing her after having sex with me, but now certainly is not the time or the place.</p><p>The previous song fades and No Doubt\u2019s, \u2018Don\u2019t Speak\u2019 starts to pump out through the speakers.</p><p>Jake looks up like Gwen Stefani is here and speaking to him right now. And really the song couldn\u2019t be more apt for him and I.</p><p>I wonder if he\u2019s thinking the same.</p><p>He looks down at me, a sudden darkness in his light eyes. \u201cWell the woman I want is here with another man ... so what\u2019s a guy to do?\u201d he says the words slow, deliberate.</p><p>Honestly, right now, I have no clue. But all I do know is we\u2019re ripping each other to pieces. And this song is killing me.</p><p>I make to leave, but he\u2019s not letting me go anywhere and the next thing I know he\u2019s up against my back, arms holding me there, dancing with me, moving me with him.</p><p>\u201cStay with me tonight,\u201d he whispers in my ear. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sleep without you. I need you.\u201d</p><p>It makes my heart ache.</p><p>\u201cNo you don\u2019t.\u201d I turn, brushing against his chest. \u201cYou made that pretty clear earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d He stares down, looking deep into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cHave you still got my panties in your pocket?\u201d</p><p>He grins.</p><p>\u201cCan I have them back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>He spins me out, then pulls me back, hard into his chest.</p><p>My heart is beating out of mine.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you stop Stuart from dancing with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he has work to do.\u201d He pulls me even closer, his hand on my lower back.</p><p>I raise my eyebrow sceptically at him.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he exhales loudly. \u201cWatching him dancing with you was driving me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gay!\u201d I exclaim.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if he\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 monk. I hated seeing his hands all over you. If he wasn\u2019t so good at his job, I\u2019d fire his ass,\u201d he mutters.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d fire Stuart for dancing with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were so jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did I.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him for a long moment. \u201cFor your information, I asked Stuart to dance with me, and he only agreed to, to help distract me from your sexploits with your groupie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told him about us?\u201d He looks surprised.</p><p>I shake my head, no. \u201cHe guessed, he\u2019s not stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShame your boyfriend is.\u201d</p><p>I give him a sharp look. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I warn him. \u201cI\u2019m not fighting with you again about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I think we\u2019re pretty good at it. Even better at the making up. You felt amazing before, Tru,\u201d he whispers close. \u201cYou always feel amazing, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you, making you feel as good as you do me.\u201d</p><p>My skin hums.</p><p>He\u2019s so close. I can feel his heat all over me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, Tru.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were done with me?\u201d I say, making sure my voice is steady, even though my insides are trembling. \u201cAnd after watching you with her, I\u2019m feeling pretty done myself.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t mean it, but I\u2019m hurting badly.</p><p>He stares down at me for a long moment. I see such a multitude of emotions pass over his face it\u2019s hard to pin down an exact one.</p><p>Jake opens his mouth to speak, when I hear Will\u2019s voice come from behind him.</p><p>\u201cMind if I dance with my girl?\u201d</p><p>I was so lost in Jake, I didn\u2019t register Will\u2019s approach.</p><p>I feel Jake\u2019s body stiffen under my hands. He looks down at me, a myriad of emotions flicker through his eyes. Then he releases me and steps away.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s all yours.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s more meaning in those three words, than there has been in anything he\u2019s said to me all night.</p><p>Panic rips through me. And all I can do is watch weakly, as Jake makes his way through the crowd, all eyes on him, as he heads straight to the bar.</p><p>Will pulls me into his arms.</p><p>I\u2019m numb. Completely devoid.</p><p>\u201cYou looked amazing out here dancing with Stuart and Jake,\u201d Will murmurs in my ear. \u201cI was starting to get a little jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only Jake,\u201d I downplay, even though inside I feel like I\u2019m dying. \u201cAnd you do realise Stuart\u2019s gay, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh right.\u201d I see the realisation fire up in his eyes.</p><p>Will moves me around on the dance floor, and I catch sight of Jake. He\u2019s doing tequila shots at the bar. He\u2019s not looking anywhere in my direction. And he\u2019s got company again.</p><p>Zzhuilette is back and hanging off him like a cheap suit.</p><p>Then I watch, with distasteful horror, as she dips her finger in Jake\u2019s tequila glass, draws a wet line across her huge chest and pours the salt across it.</p><p>It\u2019s like a car crash that I can\u2019t take my eyes off, even though watching it is making me feel sick to the pit of my stomach.</p><p>And Jake, with Tom jeering him on, leans down and licks the salt off her chest, slowly. Then he grabs his shot and throws it back.</p><p>I feel a burning shot of jealously and rage so intense that I just want to go over there and kick her ass. And Jake\u2019s too.</p><p>I turn away, burying my head into Will\u2019s neck, forcing back tears.</p><p>He holds me tighter. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much, darling,\u201d he murmurs, running his fingers through my long hair and down my back.</p><p>I lift my head looking at him. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>And I realise in this moment, I have missed him. So much. My lovely sweet Will.</p><p>He would never hurt me. He would never lick salt off the chests of long-legged redheads.</p><p>I\u2019m safe with Will. I\u2019ll always be safe with Will.</p><p>I just have to let Jake go, and stay with him. It\u2019s the right thing to do.</p><p>Life will always be simple, easy with Will.</p><p>I reach up on my tiptoes and kiss him firmly on the lips. He wraps his arms around me, holding me tight to his body.</p><p>He tastes of beer, and his kiss feels exactly the same as always.</p><p>He\u2019s nothing like Jake. Which is good \u2013 I think.</p><p>Will is sweet and lovely, but... no, something\u2019s missing. And it\u2019s been missing since Jake came back into my life, I now realise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wind my fingers around his neck, up into his hair, kissing him harder, pushing myself into him, into this kiss, trying to ignite the fire I feel in my belly whenever Jake kisses me. Whenever Jake looks at me.</p><p>But it doesn\u2019t come.</p><p>Was it always missing? Or is it because of Jake. Am I done for life now? Will I never again feel with anyone, how I feel when I\u2019m with him. When he\u2019s touching me, kissing me, making love to me.</p><p>Am I ruined to him?</p> <p>I break off breathing heavy. Will\u2019s eyes are hooded, alive with love for me.</p><p>But all I feel is lost and confused and lonely.</p><p>And in this exact moment, I realise that I don\u2019t want simple. I want Jake in all his crazy complicatedness.</p><p>I do love Will, but I love Jake more.</p><p>It\u2019s always been him my whole life. And I don\u2019t want to lose him. He\u2019s my best friend. My everything.</p> <p>I have to talk to him. I need to tell him that I don\u2019t care about the redhead. I don\u2019t care about any of it. All the mistakes we\u2019ve both made. We can start fresh from now.</p><p>I\u2019ll tell Will everything, right now, if that\u2019s what he wants. I\u2019ll do whatever he wants me to do. Because I love him.</p><p>Totally and completely love him. I always have. And I can\u2019t imagine another moment in my life with him not in it.</p><p>I glance to where Jake was at the bar, but he\u2019s nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Where is he?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d I say to Will. \u201cYou mind if we sit?\u201d</p> <p>I need to find Jake.</p><p>\u201cNo, come on.\u201d Will puts his arm around my shoulder and steers me back to our table. \u201cWe can leave soon if you\u2019d like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that would be good.\u201d</p><p>Where has Jake disappeared to?</p><p>Will smiles at me and plants a kiss on my hair.</p><p>I know I should feel terrible right now for Will, but I can\u2019t seem to muster any guilt up at all.</p><p>All I want is to see Jake.</p><p>I sit down in the chair next to Stuart, the others now filled with Simone and Denny.</p> <p>She looks so totally smitten with him. It warms my heart. I want to be sitting here like that with Jake. The world knowing we belong to one another.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to use the bathroom,\u201d Will says. \u201cThen we can head back if you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say distracted. I\u2019m just relieved he\u2019s going so I can find Jake.</p><p>When Will is gone, I take a surreptitious glance around the room, looking for Jake.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone, honey,\u201d Stuart leans across and whispers in my ear. \u201cDave\u2019s taken him back to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>I get this terrible, awful, sick feeling deep in my stomach.</p><p>\u201cDid he ... go alone?\u201d</p><p>Stuart slowly shakes his head, no.</p><p>My heart starts to compress in on itself.</p><p>I swallow down, my throat tight. \u201cThe redhead?\u201d I have to ask, even though I\u2019m pretty sure of the answer.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He gives me a sad look, pats my leg with his hand, and picks up a shot off the table, handing it to me.</p><p>\u201cDrink this, sweetheart. It won\u2019t fix things, but after a few of these, things sure do start to seem a lot easier.\u201d</p><p>Holding back tears that are burning my throat raw, I take the shot. I put it down in front of me, pick the salt shaker up, pour it on my hand, lick it off and then throw the tequila back without hesitation.</p><p>It washes the burning of my tears away, leaving me instead with the welcome burn of alcohol.</p><p>I don\u2019t bother with the lemon or beer, inside I chase it down with my margarita, downing it in one.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, honey?\u201d Simone asks me, giving me a sympathetic smile.</p><p>She must know Jake\u2019s gone back to the hotel with Zzhuilette too.</p><p>I plaster a bright smile to my face and nod, \u201cSure I am.\u201d</p><p>But I know she knows better. She knows me.</p><p>And the alcohol, well that\u2019s just a soother for my heart, which is currently broken and laying shattered in pieces under the heel of a leggy redhead, who is more than likely, right now in bed with my best friend and only true love of my life.</p><p>And really, I only have myself to blame.</p><p>I hesitated. You can\u2019t hesitate with a man like Jake.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Oh God. I\u2019m so hungover. I actually think I\u2019m dying.</p><p>After I found out Jake had left with Zzhuilette the redhead, I set out on a mission to erase the knowledge from my mind \u2013 with the obvious help of alcohol. Basically I wanted to get slaughtered and I achieved just that.</p><p>By the time Will had got back from the toilets, I was three shots in, and back on the dance floor with Stuart.</p><p>I know he knew something was wrong with me. Honestly I think he probably thinks I\u2019m overworked, or have developed a drinking problem from spending too much time with the guys.</p><p>Will finally brought me back to the hotel around 12am as I was wasted. I remember him carrying me back to the suite. I think I was singing Mr Brightside at the top of my lungs, and then I spent a long time in the toilet, throwing up.</p><p>Poor Will. He doesn\u2019t deserve any of this. He\u2019s kind and sweet. And I\u2019m the devil.</p><p>I stretch my stiff body out, groaning, I blink my eyes open.</p><p>Will\u2019s sitting in a chair by the bed, eyes on me.</p><p>\u201cI got you a coffee.\u201d He hands me over a Starbucks container as I sit up in bed.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say gratefully. I lean up against the headboard and take a welcome drink.</p><p>\u201cYou went out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust to the Starbucks out by the hotel. I needed the air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry I got so drunk. Simone? Did she get back okay? Is she on the sofa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe stayed in Denny\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say.</p><p>Good for Simone. One day here and she pulls herself a fit drummer.</p><p>\u201cLook, Tru.\u201d Will rubs his head, pushing his fingers into his hair. \u201cIs there something going on with you? You just haven\u2019t seemed yourself at all since I arrived yesterday.\u201d</p><p>This is it. I can either tell him the truth or coward out.</p><p>Jake and I aren\u2019t going to be together. Not now.</p><p>The thought causes me actual physical pain.</p><p>And then I just know what I have to do \u2013 I have my answer. Even if I\u2019m not going to be with Jake, I can\u2019t just stay with Will because it\u2019s easier.</p><p>Yes, I love him. But obviously not enough or I would never have slept with Jake.</p><p>Will deserves to be with someone who loves him and him alone.</p><p>I put my coffee down on the nightstand and sitting up, crossing my legs in front of me, I face him.</p><p>\u201cI have to tell you something.\u201d My body starts to shake. I take the deepest breath I\u2019ve ever taken, trying to control my fears over what I\u2019m about to do.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been sleeping with Jake.\u201d</p><p>I see the shock, slowly morphing into horror and absolute pain echo across his features.</p><p>It is a look that will haunt me for a very long time.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he says slowly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Will.\u201d</p><p>He stares blankly at me. His face now washed of any emotion.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Are you being fucking serious?\u201d His tone is low and heart-breaking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean for this to happen.\u201d</p><p>He puts his head into his hands. \u201cYou didn\u2019t mean for it to happen! You\u2019ve been having sex with Jake Wethers and you didn\u2019t mean for it to happen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never meant to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying to keep it together and not break. It\u2019s not fair on him if I cry.</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d</p><p>The air seems to freeze all around us.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He puts his fist to his mouth, stifling a sob.</p><p>\u201cDo you still love me?\u201d His words are all broken.</p><p>I look up at him. Will, my lovely Will, who I\u2019ve just broken into pieces. I can\u2019t help the tear that runs from my eye. I brush it away.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answer.</p><p>His face hardens. I barely recognise him for a moment. He\u2019s out of the chair now, pacing around.</p><p>\u201cSo you love me and him! How is that even possible?! We\u2019re polar fucking opposites!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Pausing, he grabs the back of the chair. \u201cWhen did it start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive days ago. The night before the article came out was the first time anything happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it was the fucking truth! You sat on the phone and lied to me, and all along it was the fucking truth! I actually felt sorry for you, I believed you! I fucking trusted you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Will. I\u2019m so, so sorry,\u201d I cry.</p><p>\u201cIt just all makes so much fucking sense now! The way you\u2019ve been acting since I arrived, and the way he has been with you, and how you reacted to him when he was with that girl last night! I\u2019m so fucking stupid!\u201d he roars.</p><p>Then he turns from me, covering his face with his hands.</p><p>He starts to cry.</p><p>Oh fuck.</p><p>I climb off the bed, standing behind him, I put my hand tentatively on his back, tears streaming from my own eyes, but he moves away. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d he says low and gruff. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever fucking touch me again.\u201d</p><p>Leaving him, I sit on the edge of the bed, trapped in the mess I\u2019ve made.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be with him?\u201d he says suddenly, voice rough. He turns to face me.</p><p>I bind my hands in my lap. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what I want.\u201d I put my head into my hands.</p><p>\u201cHow could you have been with someone like him? He\u2019s a fucking whore! All he does is sleep with women \u2013 it\u2019s what sells his shit music! Jesus Christ, Tru, he was all over another woman last night! That\u2019s how highly he thinks of you \u2013 he was off screwing someone else the moment you couldn\u2019t give him what he wanted!\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the look on my face that makes him ask it, but whatever it is I just feel sick, knowing I\u2019m going have to tell him the truth when he says, \u201cPlease tell me you haven\u2019t had sex with him while I\u2019ve been here?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t lie to him. I want to. But I can\u2019t.</p><p>Closing my eyes briefly, I press my lips together and nod my head, slowly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Tears start to run freely from my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fucking believe this!\u201d he yells. Holding himself steady on the back of the chair, he fixes his eyes on my face. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>I rub the tears from my face. \u201cLast night.\u201d</p><p>I hear his sharp intake of breath. \u201cWhen last night?\u201d I can see his jaw working angrily under his skin.</p><p>I wet my dry lips and gulp down. \u201cAt the party.\u201d</p><p>He looks puzzled momentarily.</p><p>\u201cWhen I went to use the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fucked him in a public toilet?!\u201d he yells like I\u2019ve never heard before. I actually physically shake from the force of it.</p><p>\u201cI just ... I can\u2019t fucking believe this!\u201d</p><p>He pauses for a moment. Then slowly, he lifts his eyes to my face.</p><p>\u201cHow could you do this to me? To us?\u201d</p><p>I rub the fresh tears from off my face. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. It just happened. I didn\u2019t mean for this to happen, but, it\u2019s ... Jake.\u201d I say this like it will explain everything away to him. \u201cI\u2019ve loved him since I was young.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen him for the last fucking decade!\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even make the attempt to try to explain to him.

I gave you my heart for Christ\u2019s sake! I wanted to marry you!\u201d</p><p>His words blindside me. He wanted to marry me?

I\u2019ve loved Jake since I was young\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpare me anymore of the goddamn details!\u201d</p><p>Nervous, I look down at my hands, my eyes fixing on the bracelets. Jake\u2019s and Will\u2019s.</p> <p>And then I just know I want Jake. He\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted.</p><p>I unclip Will\u2019s bracelet from my wrist.</p><p>Getting to my feet, I hold it out in my hand to him. \u201cYou should have this back,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>He looks down at my hand. Then he grabs the bracelet and throws it across the room.</p><p>His face becomes a blind rage. I\u2019ve never seen him look this way before. Then he\u2019s striding across the room, purposefully, angrily.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I ask panicked.</p> <p>\u201cTo kick your fucking boyfriends\u2019 ass!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m moving quickly behind, but Will is already through the door, practically sprinting down the hall looking for Jake\u2019s room. He\u2019s like a man possessed.</p><p>I\u2019m screaming after him.</p><p>Then I see Jake\u2019s door open and he\u2019s standing there scanning the hall, looking worried. He must have heard my screams.</p><p>Jake registers Will, then me, and it all just happens so quickly.</p><p>Will is on him, and he punches Jake in the face.</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d I cry out, as I hear the crack from the impact.</p><p>I stop in my tracks, watching in horror, as Jake momentarily loses his footing, staggers slightly, his hand going straight to his mouth.</p> <p>\u201cDid you think you could fuck my girlfriend and I wouldn\u2019t find out?! That I would do jack shit about it?!\u201d Will yells at him. \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck who you are! I\u2019m gonna beat the shit out of you!\u201d</p><p>Jake moves his hand away and I see the blood. He looks down at his hand, then runs his tongue over his lip, licking the blood and smirks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you have that first one mother fucker, but not the next.\u201d Jake sounds unnervingly calm.</p><p>Then he punches Will hard in his face. It\u2019s so quick and unexpected.</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d I scream out, again. \u201cSTOP, PLEASE!\u201d</p><p>Will staggers back from the force and I try to help him, but he pushes me away, hard.</p><p>I lose my footing and fall against the wall hitting my shoulder, and fall onto my ass.</p><p>Jake\u2019s face flames with rage. And then he\u2019s on Will punching him to the floor, hard, repeatedly over and over.</p><p>I scramble up to my knees, finding my voice to scream, \u201cNO! STOP!\u201d begging Jake to stop, and then Dave is there, pulling Jake off Will.</p><p>Denny appears in the hall from behind me, and he\u2019s straight in there, telling Dave to get Will out of here, and taking hold of Jake, pushing him back because he looks crazy right now, like he\u2019s ready to kill Will.</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen Jake looks so wild.</p><p>Then Simone is beside me, helping me up off the floor, putting her arm around me, holding me close.</p><p>Dave pulls Will up off the floor. He\u2019s covered in blood, his lip looks cut and his eye is swelling already.</p><p>I can\u2019t help the sob that escapes me. This is all my fault. He doesn\u2019t deserve any of this.</p><p>Will shakes off Dave\u2019s grip.</p><p>\u201cSo you need your fucking bodyguard and your pussy band member to help you fight your battles for you?!\u201d Will yells at Jake.</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen Will like this before. He\u2019s like a different person. And I\u2019ve done this to him.</p><p>I see Jake\u2019s eyes narrow and he steps forward, malevolence clear on his face, but Denny pushes him back. \u201cNo man. Leave it.\u201d</p><p>Dave pulls Will further back down the hall, turning, he releases him pushing him backwards. \u201cYou need to leave. Get your stuff and go,\u201d Dave says firmly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t I\u2019ll remove you myself.\u201d</p><p>Simone moves me out of the way, backing me up against the wall, as Will steps back.</p><p>He turns to me.</p><p>I see complete hatred on his face which is meant solely for me. Tears are running free from my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI loved you, Tru. I would have done anything for you. But how wrong was I. You\u2019re just some cheap fucking whore, like he is. You deserve each other.\u201d</p><p>Then he turns and storms away. Dave walks past me, following Will as he goes back into my suite.</p><p>My whole body is shaking.</p><p>Everyone has just been witness to the fact that I\u2019ve been sleeping with Jake behind Will\u2019s back. Even though they probably already knew, I still have never felt trashier than I do in this moment.</p><p>I should go after Will, I know, but what can I say that will make this better?</p><p>I knew what I was doing by telling him. Yes, it was the right thing to do. But I was also making my decision. I was choosing Jake.</p><p>He may not want me now after all this. And I don\u2019t know how I feel about him sleeping with Zzhuilette.</p><p>But I love him. I\u2019ll always love him. It\u2019s always been him.</p><p>The door opposite me opens and Tom stumbles out, looking half-asleep.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck\u2019s going on out here?\u201d he yawns, stretching his arms over his head, as he glances around taking in the scene.</p><p>Me in my pyjamas in Simone\u2019s arms crying. Jake bleeding from the mouth. Denny in his boxer shorts.</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d he says putting two and two together, dropping his arms down. \u201cGuess, I\u2019ll leave you guys to it then.\u201d Stepping back he closes his door.</p><p>Jake hasn\u2019t taken his eyes off me, but I can\u2019t bring myself to meet his stare.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Simone says to me. \u201cYou can\u2019t stay out here.\u201d Because Will could come back out soon, she leaves off.</p><p>Moving me forward, my legs feel like lead as she steers me into Jake\u2019s suite. He steps back, making room for me to pass.</p><p>Denny closes the door behind us all, as Simone sits me down on the sofa, sitting beside me.</p><p>It\u2019s utter silence in the room. The most uncomfortable silence I\u2019ve ever been in.</p><p>\u201cCome on, man, let\u2019s clean you up.\u201d Denny jerks his head in the direction of the bathroom at Jake, breaking the unnerving silence.</p><p>Jake looks at me. He seems hesitant to go, but after a long, lingering moment, he wordlessly follows Denny through the bedroom to the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you some water.\u201d Simone gets up and quickly returns with a bottle of water and a wad of tissues, handing me them both.</p><p>I wipe my face dry with the tissues, putting the bottle beside me on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cHow did he find out?\u201d she asks in a quiet voice.</p><p>\u201cI told him.\u201d I glance at her, a fresh tear leaking from my eye. I wipe it away. \u201cHe knew something wasn\u2019t right from my behaviour last night, and I couldn\u2019t keep lying to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I did the wrong thing in the beginning. I\u2019ve fucked everything up, Simone.\u201d Leaning forward, I put my head in my hands, as tears form in my eyes again.</p><p>Simone rubs my back. \u201cYou made a few errors in judgement granted, but you\u2019re only human, Tru. And you\u2019re clearly in love with Jake.\u201d</p><p>I turn my head glancing at her. \u201cI know, but I still shouldn\u2019t have done what I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t have, but there\u2019s no changing it now I\u2019m afraid.\u201d She tucks my hair behind my ear. \u201cSo now you have to figure out what you\u2019re going to do from here.\u201d She nods her head in the direction of the bathroom.</p><p>She means what am I going to do about Jake.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m taking it you and Will have broken up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I should jump straight into something with Jake, and ... well, Jake spent the night with another woman.\u201d My lips turn down at the corners.</p><p>I was half-expecting Zzhuilette to be here in his room to be honest as it\u2019s still so early.</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I look at her surprised. \u201cHe did. Stuart told me Dave had brought him and her back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was leaving the party with Denny last night, not long after you left, and Tom said he was coming back with us, that he\u2019d just got off the phone with Jake \u2013 said Jake had called him and he was wrecked and was in a real mess over you. He said he\u2019d never known Jake to be like that over a girl, and it was freaking him the fuck out. I said I thought he\u2019d left with that girl too, but Tom said there was definitely no girl with him because no girl would have put up with his whining over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd from what I know, Tom spent most of the night in Jake\u2019s room talking him down. I know for definite there was no girl in here because Denny was so worried about him that he left me to go check on him too. When he came back, he said that maybe I should talk to you, because Jake was really screwed up over the whole Will being here thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve messed up so badly,\u201d I whisper, the tears starting again.</p><p>I\u2019m relieved that Jake hadn\u2019t slept with her, but I\u2019m all cut up over Will and how much I\u2019ve hurt him. I just don\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>The bathroom door in the bedroom opens, and Jake comes out with Denny behind him.</p><p>My whole body tenses.</p><p>The blood\u2019s gone from his lip, but it\u2019s all swollen and readying for a bruise.</p><p>He comes over and sits on the edge of the sofa, opposite me, resting his elbows on his knees, clasping his hands together, he looks over at me with wary eyes.</p><p>I dry my tearstained face again, and set the damp tissues on the sofa beside me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna go get some breakfast,\u201d Simone says, rising to her feet. \u201cI\u2019ll come and see you later.\u201d She rubs my shoulder.</p><p>Then she and Denny are gone, and it\u2019s just me and Jake, and a whole lot of silence.</p><p>\u201cYou told him,\u201d he says quietly, like he can barely believe it.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I look at him surprised. \u201cHe knew there was something different about me, and because I couldn\u2019t go on lying to him ... and because of you, Jake ... because I hated what this was doing to you \u2013 had done to you.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me with such intensity, it\u2019s momentarily almost too much to handle. My insides are quaking.</p><p>\u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d</p><p>I look confused.</p><p>\u201cWhen he pushed you and you hit the wall, did he hurt you?\u201d</p><p>I touch my shoulder. \u201cNo. I\u2019m fine. I should be the one asking if you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m lying, it hurt, it still does, but I don\u2019t want to anger him anymore than he already has been.</p><p>He puts his finger to his lip. \u201cIt looks worse than it is.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEven so, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he hit me or because you told him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he hit you. Because of everything I\u2019ve done. I\u2019ve fucked everything up so badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with me you haven\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t help but look at his face, searching, hoping he really means it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad he hit me, Tru, if it means he finally knows. I\u2019m sorry he\u2019s hurt, but I\u2019m not sorry he knows about us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there an us?\u201d I hold my breath.</p><p>\u201cYou tell me?\u201d</p><p>I exhale. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you sleep with Juliette?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never intended to. I left because I wanted out of that party. I couldn\u2019t stand to see you with Will, and I took her with me because I wanted you to know I\u2019d left with her ... I wanted you to think I had slept with her \u2013 to hurt you \u2013 not very mature I know, but...\u201d He shrugs. \u201cSo well, I got Dave to drop her off at her place first, then he brought me back here, and I spent the night with a bottle of Jack, and Tom came later on.\u201d He stares straight into my eyes. \u201cDo you really think I could have had sex with her, when I\u2019d just had sex with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kissed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was acting like a dumb ass. Like I said, I wanted to hurt you, because you\u2019d hurt me.\u201d He brushes his thumb over the scar on his chin. \u201cI don\u2019t do rejection well. But I\u2019d never go that far. And you kissed Will, remember?\u201d</p><p>I knot my fingers together in my lap, nodding gently.</p><p>\u201cIt did hurt me,\u201d I whisper, \u201cSeeing you with her, knowing you\u2019d left there with her. The pain I felt was unbearable. So I got drunk to try and kill it, and spent the rest of the night throwing up, before passing out.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s my subtle way of telling him I didn\u2019t have sex with Will. I know it was weighing on his mind, he didn\u2019t have to say.</p> <p>I see his face relax, and he lifts his eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re such a light weight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he says.</p><p>I love you, just as simple as that.</p><p>I stare at him, wide eyed. It\u2019s like time has frozen all around me.</p><p>Jake gets up, his eyes never leaving mine, and walks over to me. He kneels on the floor at my feet and takes hold of my hands.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he repeats. \u201cI\u2019ve only ever loved one girl, Tru \u2013 and that\u2019s you. It\u2019s always been you. I loved you from the moment I knew how to love.\u201d</p><p>My eyes fill with tears again, them quickly spilling over, down my cheeks.</p> <p>Jake takes my face in his hands, caressing my tears away with his thumbs. \u201cYou\u2019re it for me. I want to be with you forever. I want you to be mine.\u201d</p><p>I stare deep into his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve always been yours, and I always will be. I love you too ... so much.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen Jake look as happy as he does in this moment.</p><p>He leans over and gently kisses my lips. I press harder against them, wanting more from him.</p><p>He hisses, and I quickly pull back. \u201cShit, sorry, baby,\u201d I murmur, smoothing my finger over his cut, swollen lip.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worth the pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hit him,\u201d I say, regretfully. \u201cA lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one hurts my girl, because you are, Tru ... my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know ... and you\u2019re my guy.\u201d I trace my finger across his cheek.</p><p>\u201cForever.\u201d His eyes close under my touch.</p><p>\u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really sure he didn\u2019t hurt you?\u201d He opens his eyes after a moment, and runs his hand gently over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, really. It didn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he says, getting to his feet, pulling me to my own. He leads me through to the bedroom, pulling the duvet back; he climbs into bed, making space for me.</p><p>I\u2019m hesitant.</p><p>I\u2019ve only just broken up with Will. Somehow it doesn\u2019t seem right climbing into bed with Jake.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he says softly, seeing my hesitation. \u201cI just want to hold you.\u201d</p><p>I climb into bed beside him and he wraps his arms around me, holding me to him and pulls the duvet over us.</p><p>He kisses my hair. \u201cI love you so much,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cThis is it now. Just you and me.</p><p>I tilt my head back, kissing a place on his neck. \u201cJust you and me,\u201d I echo.</p><p>I nestle my head into his neck, breathing him in, feeling suddenly exhausted, as I try to work through the conflicting emotions still raging through me.</p><p>When I wake I\u2019m Jake\u2019s arms, the sky coming in through the window looks dusky. We\u2019ve slept the whole day away.</p><p>I\u2019m supposed to be going home. Jake too. Our flights out of Paris are tonight.</p><p>Suddenly the thought of leaving him crushes my chest.</p><p>Then I think of Will, and pure sadness engulfs me. Tears instantly prick my eyes.</p><p>I wonder if he got an early flight? I hope he got home okay.</p><p>Will. Lovely sweet Will. What have I done to him?</p><p>I hope he\u2019s okay. I didn\u2019t want it to end the way it did. Maybe I should call him? Try to explain?</p><p>No, what good would that do, and anyway, he hates me.</p><p>He\u2019s right to.</p><p>I cheated on him. I broke his trust and his heart. I\u2019ve scarred him; he won\u2019t trust another woman for a long time to come because of me. And he\u2019s so gentle and caring; he didn\u2019t deserve any of what I\u2019ve done to him</p><p>But I love Jake. I know it\u2019s a poor excuse but I couldn\u2019t help myself.</p><p>The way I feel about him is indescribable. It\u2019s overwhelming. Sometimes so much so that I feel like I\u2019m gasping for air with the intensity of the feelings I have for him</p><p>But then, is this the right way for Jake and I to start our life together, off the back of a broken relationship?</p><p>I don\u2019t think it is. But I suppose, mine and Jake\u2019s relationship started a long time ago. It spans our lifetime.</p><p>I hurt for Will and how I treated him, I always will, but Jake is where I want to be.</p><p>He\u2019s my home.</p><p>Jake stirs in his sleep, his eyes opening slowly. And when he looks at me, all I see in them is complete love for me.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d His voice is all sleepy and sexy.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>I look at the bruising on his lip; the swelling has gone down a little. A reminder of what happened only this morning.</p><p>I trace my fingertip over it. Jake takes hold of my hand kissing my fingertips. Then puts his hand on my face, tucking my hair behind my ear.</p><p>\u201cI love waking up with you. I want to wake up every morning looking at your face,\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>Shivers run over my skin.</p><p>\u201cMe too. But we have to go home tonight.\u201d My lips turn down at the corners.</p><p>\u201cDo we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got work to do at the magazine,\u201d I sigh. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve got PR to do for the US leg of the tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about any of that. It can wait. Stay with me here in Paris for a few more days. I\u2019m not ready to be away from you, not when I\u2019ve only just got you.\u201d</p><p>I stare at his face. \u201cI guess I could call, Vicky...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, a beautiful smile that reaches all the way to his eyes. Then he moves his face closer to mine and kisses me gently on the lips, tracing his fingers over my skin, moving them into my hair. It feels gentle, tender.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your lip?\u201d I murmur.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt anymore.\u201d He rolls me onto my back, keeping me in his arms, his kiss deepens and I know what he wants.</p><p>This is it.</p><p>This is the first time Jake and I will be together properly. The first time we\u2019ll make love as an official couple.</p><p>The thought makes me feel heady. No more guilt, no more sneaking around. Just him and me</p><p>I wind my fingers into his hair, letting his tongue roam mine, kissing, nipping, licking.</p><p>I lift, allowing Jake to pull my vest off. His mouth goes straight to my nipple.</p><p>My hips lift with the feeling and he puts his hand there, touching me through the fabric of my pyjama bottom and panties.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Jake,\u201d I groan.</p><p>I put my hand between cotton and skin, taking him in my hand. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever get used to his size. It surprises me even now.</p><p>I start to work my hand up and down.</p><p>Jake hisses between his teeth, then sucks harder on my nipple.</p><p>\u201cGod, Tru you drive me crazy. I just want to be inside you all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d I breathe, pushing myself into his hand.</p><p>He yanks my pyjama bottoms and panties down in one, and I kick them off my legs.</p><p>\u201cWhat no panty ripping today?\u201d I tease. \u201cWhat is it with you and panties anyway? What\u2019s your beef with them?\u201d</p><p>He lifts his head, grinning at me. \u201cIt\u2019s a love/hate relationship, baby. I love how they look on you. Hate that they\u2019re blocking my access.\u201d</p><p>I giggle.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it when I do it?\u201d He trails his finger down my stomach.</p><p>\u201cI love it,\u201d I murmur, kissing his lips.</p><p>\u201cI never ripped anyone\u2019s panties off before, you know,\u201d he says, under my still moving mouth.</p><p>I stop kissing him. \u201cYou haven\u2019t?\u201d I just figured this was a Jake thing.</p><p>He shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cSo why do you tear mine off?\u201d</p><p>He stares down at me with his beautiful blue eyes. \u201cBecause that\u2019s how crazy you make me feel. I\u2019ve never wanted anyone the way I want you, Tru. I just can\u2019t wait to be inside you.\u201d</p><p>His words are so intense, so fixed with meaning that the muscles in my tummy clench, leaving me feeling doubly delicious.</p><p>It amazes me how easily his words can unravel me.</p><p>\u201cI love that it\u2019s our thing ... so do you want me to put them back on so you can rip them off?\u201d I bite down on my lip.</p><p>\u201cFuck no! I\u2019m not covering you back up now, and anyway, I\u2019ve got my whole life to spend ripping your panties off.\u201d</p><p>His whole life. I love the sound of that.</p><p>He slides his finger inside me.</p><p>My hips buck, grinding myself into his hand, and all thoughts of ripped underwear slip from my mind, and I start to work his still growing erection quickly in my hand.</p><p>He moans and kissing my shoulder, he bites gently on my skin.</p><p>\u201cI want to make love to you,\u201d he groans, rubbing his thumb over my hot spot.</p><p>\u201cAhh,\u201d I moan. \u201cYes, and now, because if you keep doing that then I\u2019m going to come any second.\u201d</p><p>Jake pushes his boxer shorts off, then lays between my legs, framing me.</p><p>\u201cAre you on birth control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to use a condom. I want our first proper time together as a couple to be special. I want to feel you, Tru.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d I trail off. I know I shouldn\u2019t think it, but all those women he\u2019s had sex with.</p><p>And as if reading my thoughts he says, \u201cI\u2019ve never had sex without a condom before in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he reaffirms. \u201cSTD\u2019s and unwanted pregnancies are not something I ever aspired to have, Tru. And I get regular check-ups, my last was a week before we met back up, and I haven\u2019t had sex with anyone since then but you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wants me to be his first.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s kind of like I\u2019m taking your virginity,\u201d I grin.</p><p>\u201cI guess it kind of is,\u201d he chuckles lightly, then his eyes turn serious. \u201cI\u2019ve never made love with anyone but you, because there is only you who I\u2019ve ever loved.\u201d</p><p>I lift my hips up, pushing against him, my feelings for him driving through me. \u201cI want to feel you, Jake. I want you to make love to me.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes turn lustful, laced thick with desire. And without taking his from mine, he very slowly eases himself inside me.</p><p>\u201cFuuucckk,\u201d he groans, slowly.</p><p>I watch him with contentment and love, and my own desire fuelling through me. I reach my hand up to his face.</p><p>\u201cYou felt amazing before, Tru, but, Jesus Christ. You feel fuckin\u2019 insane.\u201d</p><p>He leans down, putting his mouth on mine, slowly pulling out of me, he eases himself back in, groaning once again into my mouth.</p> <p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>I wrap my legs around him, holding him deep inside me, not letting him go.</p><p>He traps my face between both his hands. \u201cI love you, and I always will.\u201d He kisses me deeply, passionately as he starts to pick up pace, losing himself to the moment, to me, the sensation, as he moves me all over the bed, making desperate love to me.</p><p>And in this moment I have never felt happier, or more loved, than I do now here with Jake.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>Jake and I spent the rest of yesterday in his suite. We got room service and watched a movie, and did other things of course.</p> <p>I called Vicky at home and explained everything that had been happening with Jake and Will. I thought it was going to be a really awkward conversation, but Vicky\u2019s not stupid, she knew.</p><p>She told me to take as long as I need off work, the bio\u2019s the focus anyway and as I\u2019m now getting up close and personal with our intended she didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>But I do, I don\u2019t want to take liberties.</p><p>After I came off the phone with Vicky, I did start thinking about the bio, and how is it kind of weird that Jake and I are couple, and I\u2019m still going to be writing it.</p><p>I started to think maybe I shouldn\u2019t be.</p><p>When I tried to broach the subject with Jake he just brushed me off. He said it doesn\u2019t matter as most of the European tour was noted before we started anything together, so it\u2019s not a big deal.</p><p>But I don\u2019t know, a part of me feels like it\u2019s a conflict of interest, then on the flip side I don\u2019t want to lose this great opportunity for my career, so I\u2019m trying not to over think it at the moment.</p><p>I called my dad too. He wasn\u2019t surprised about Jake and I either. He must have sensed it when they visited.</p> <p>And whereas my dad was absolutely delighted about Jake and I, my mum was, as I expected, a little more reserved about it.</p><p>She knows what it\u2019s like to live with a musician, and with one as famous as Jake and his past tendencies, she said to me, as she had before, that she\u2019s worried for my heart.</p><p>I love her so much for her concern, but I know Jake will never break my heart. I'm not just any other girl to him. We\u2019ve known each other a lifetime.</p><p>Yes, I know life with Jake will be bumpy, crazy and a little difficult at times, but I don\u2019t think he would ever truly hurt me.</p><p>I know because I can see it in his eyes every time he looks at me \u2013 his love for me, and I wonder how I never saw it there before.</p><p>Maybe I couldn\u2019t see it because he was afraid to truly show it to me. But now all those doors are open and I couldn\u2019t be happier.</p><p>\u201cBaby, can you pass me the jam?\u201d</p><p>Jake and I are eating breakfast out on the balcony of his suite, with Paris as our backdrop.</p><p>Stuart is inside working in the living room rearranging Jake\u2019s cancelled appearances back in the US. The ones he\u2019s cancelled to stay here with me.</p><p>Stuart could work out of his own suite I suppose, but he does need to ask Jake things from time to time, and I think he gets a little lonely in his suite. I know I would. And I think he\u2019s just used to being around Jake. I love the friendship they have, and I like having Stuart around, he\u2019s fun and cool.</p><p>Jake passes over the jam and as I\u2019m taking hold of it, he catches hold of my wrist and pulls me forward across the table. Meeting me halfway, he plants a long delicious kiss on my lips.</p><p>\u201cYou taste yummy,\u201d I murmur. He\u2019s been eating pain au chocolat.</p><p>\u201cSo did you,\u201d he winks, and my face instantly flushes.</p><p>He\u2019s referring to what he was doing to me in bed first thing this morning.</p><p>Shivers run from my head to my toes at the memory, a heat rising fast in me.</p><p>I sit back in my seat, picking up a knife, I spread jam on my croissant.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you want to do today?\u201d Jake asks. \u201cWe could go sightseeing, do the whole touristy thing, Eiffel tower and that, and go out to lunch \u2013 we could go to the delicatessen that make the mini-cakes you love ... or I can take you shopping and buy you lots of pretty things. I\u2019m sure Denny would be up for it if you wanted Simone along for the shopping?\u201d</p><p>Simone decided to stay on as well. She took a few days off work to spend with Denny as they are getting on really well. I\u2019m so happy for her.</p><p>Tom and Smith took the jet back to LA. So there\u2019s just the four of us, and Stuart, and of course Dave and Ben are still here in Paris also.</p><p>And Paris is beautiful. I\u2019ve barely seen any of it while I\u2019ve been here and I really want to go out with Jake today, but I don\u2019t think I should.</p><p>I scrunch my face up in anticipation of what I\u2019m going to say.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he sighs, running his fingers through his hair. \u201cIs this the \u2013 me spending money on you thing, again? Because seriously, Tru, we\u2019re together now and I have a lot of money and I want to spoil you rotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. I mean I don\u2019t want you spending ridiculous amounts of money on me, but I get that you\u2019re rich and things are different when you\u2019re rich so I\u2019ll have to get used to that ... it\u2019s just.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His brow furrows.</p><p>\u201cI just thought maybe we could stay in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe stayed in all day yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and it was so awesome that I want to do it all over again.\u201d</p><p>His frown deepens causing a line to form between his brows, so I know he\u2019s not buying it.</p><p>\u201cYesterday was awesome, no doubting that, and last night and this morning too, but that\u2019s not it, Tru, there\u2019s something you\u2019re not telling me. Why don\u2019t you want to go out with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do ... it\u2019s just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just what?\u201d His tone is so forceful, that I give him a sharp look.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s just, I um...\u201d I drag my fingers nervously through my hair. \u201cI just know that if we go out together, it\u2019s highly likely that we\u2019ll be photographed together, because you\u2019re well \u2013 you. And because you\u2019re you, and you\u2019re out with a woman ... those photos will undoubtedly end up in the tabloids at some point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want people to know we\u2019re together?\u201d He\u2019s still frowning at me. \u201cAre you ashamed of me or something?\u201d</p><p>Ashamed of him? Where did that come from?</p><p>\u201cNo! How could you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d He rubs his forehead with his fingers, giving me a hard stare. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t want to be seen in public with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. I do want to be seen in public with you, I\u2019m so happy to be with you. I love you. It\u2019s just...\u201d How do I say this without causing a row? \u201cWill and I only broke up yesterday.\u201d</p><p>His face darkens at the mention of Will, just like I knew it would.</p><p>\u201cAnd I just think it would be really insensitive of me to go out in public with you and for those pictures to end up in the press for him to see. It\u2019d be like rubbing salt in his already raw wound, and I don\u2019t want to hurt him anymore that I already have done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is about Will. What a fuckin\u2019 surprise!\u201d He throws his hands up in the air. \u201cAll you seem to care about is his feelings. What about my feelings, Tru? Or are they still irrelevant to you?\u201d</p><p>I look at him shocked. \u201cYour feelings were never irrelevant to me. I care about you, Jake \u2013 so much. I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of you hurting. I love you \u2013 I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you\u2019ve got a funny way of showing it.\u201d He folds his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being irrational.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes \u2013 you!\u201d I\u2019m starting to get really annoyed now. \u201cWe had an affair behind Will\u2019s back! I broke his heart only yesterday morning! I\u2019m trying to spare causing him anymore pain than I\u2019ve already done!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t think I wasn\u2019t in pain? All the time you were still with him, stuck between me and him, and then having to see you with him at my show and then the after party. I sat here that night driving myself fuckin\u2019 crazy thinking about you in that room with him! Sleeping in that bed with him! Jesus Christ!\u201d He picks his cigarettes up off the table and angrily gets one out.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t sleep with Will, I told you, and I haven\u2019t since we started sleeping together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m talking about sex here, Tru?\u201d He slams the cigarette packet back on the table. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the fact that you were lying in bed, next to him, all night, when it should have been me. I should have been the one waking up beside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have me now!\u201d I yell frustrated. \u201cAnd every single day from now! Why are we even talking about this?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t want to be seen in public with me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do!\u201d I take a calming breath in through my nose. \u201cI just want to wait a little while,\u201d I say in a calmer voice. \u201cLet things settle down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me you won\u2019t go out with me?\u201d His gaze is fixed and determined</p><p>I shake my head, no.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He pushes his chair out, the metal legs scraping loudly against the stony floor and gets to his feet. \u201cI\u2019ll see if Denny and Simone want to do something with me \u2013 maybe I should take Stuart as my date.\u201d He tosses his unlit cigarette onto the table.</p><p>\u201cJake, please let\u2019s not do this.\u201d I stand up, reaching for him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well I do.\u201d</p><p>He storms off into living room.</p><p>I get out of my chair, and follow him in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being unfair,\u201d I say, from behind him.</p><p>Stuart looks up from the laptop.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being unfair?!\u201d Jake rounds on me.</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019re acting like a spoilt child who can\u2019t get his own way.\u201d</p><p>Stuart gets out of his seat and quietly slips across the room, and out the main door. I don\u2019t blame him. I wish I could leave too.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and you\u2019re acting like someone who still has feelings for her ex! Are we really back there again Tru? You stuck between me and Will again? Do you want to go back to him?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat? No! Where is this even coming from?\u201d I grip my head frustrated. \u201cI chose you! And I would choose you every single time! But I broke Will\u2019s heart in doing so. The very least I can do is try and make things a little easier for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t choose me.\u201d His tone is low and cold. \u201cWill made the decision for you when you told him the truth. You never said to him, \u2018I\u2019m ending this with you because I want to be with Jake\u2019.

Running off back to Will?\u201d he says bitterly from behind me.</p><p>I stop at the door.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m just getting as far away as possible from you and your goddamn self-destruct button!\u201d</p> <p>I slam the door loudly behind me, then run to my room, tears streaming down my cheeks.</p><p>Look at us. Two minutes into our relationship and we\u2019re already fighting.</p><p>I just wish he could see things from my point of view. I\u2019m not trying to hurt him, but I don\u2019t want to cause Will any more pain than I already have.</p><p>Is this going to be Jake and I? When it\u2019s good it\u2019s great and when it\u2019s bad it\u2019s really awful.</p><p>We never used to fight like this when we were younger.</p><p>But I guess back then, sex and passion weren\u2019t part of our relationship, and those two things can go a long way to flaring up arguments. I don\u2019t know, maybe we\u2019ve just moved too fast together.</p> <p>I\u2019m in my bed, where I\u2019ve been for the last hour and a half, staring blankly at the TV, stewing and crying over my fight with Jake.</p><p>I wonder if he\u2019s gone out with Simone and Denny?</p><p>Part of me wants to go and see him and sort this out. But I\u2019m still majorly pissed off with him, and my pride just won\u2019t let me.</p><p>I\u2019ve done nothing wrong so I\u2019m definitely sitting this one out.</p><p>Adele suddenly starts to ring on my nightstand. I haven\u2019t checked my phone in days.</p><p>As I pick it up, I see there\u2019s a load of missed calls, voicemail messages and texts.</p><p>Will I\u2019m guessing.</p><p>I\u2019ll deal with them later, because right now, Jake is calling me.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re calling me?\u201d I say in \u2018still angry Tru\u2019 mode.</p><p>I\u2019m not ready to forgive him just yet, even if him calling me is just so ridiculously sweet considering he\u2019s only down the hall. Well I hope he is.</p><p>\u201cWell, you were massively pissed off at me for good reason,\u201d he adds quietly. \u201cAnd I thought I\u2019d try calling first, see how the land lies ... see if you\u2019ve calmed down yet ... so have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalmed down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I come and see you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I grin.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a dick, Jake Wethers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I\u2019m a dick who\u2019s crazy in love with you ... if I said I was sorry would that make us okay?\u201d</p><p>I sigh, keeping up the pretence of my anger, which disappeared the second he said \u2018crazy in love\u2019.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be a start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about some flowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about me, on my knees outside your door holding a bunch of flowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re outside my door aren\u2019t you?\u201d My skin shivers in delight.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he murmurs. I can hear his smile down the line, and it touches me.</p><p>With butterflies swishing through my stomach, I climb out of bed and pad my way across the room, through the living room and swing the door open to find Jake on his knees outside my door with a huge bouquet of flowers in his hand.</p><p>He looks up at me with his gorgeous blue, puppy dog eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cAnd you look like an idiot, get up,\u201d I say, suppressing the huge smile I feel.</p><p>He gets to his feet and holds the flowers out for me to take.</p><p>Taking them, I hold them to my nose and inhale. They are absolutely beautiful. All pinks, purples and creams. Roses, peonies, lilies and gerberas, and some I don\u2019t even recognise. They look expensive.</p><p>\u201cSo you bought me flowers by way of an apology.\u201d I lift an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he smiles, a careful smile.</p><p>\u201cDid you order them in?\u201d I\u2019m not ready to let him off the hook just yet.</p><p>His brow furrows. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend Stuart out for them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says clearly affronted. \u201cI went out to the flower shop down the street and bought and picked them myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear any screaming from your fans when they spotted you in the street.\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cI put a disguise on.\u201d</p><p>I squint at him, cocking my head to the side.</p><p>\u201cSunglasses and a hat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no one recognised you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say, softly. \u201cThey\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He reaches for my hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was being a jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t being a jerk, you were being irrational.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was. It\u2019s just because I love you so much.\u201d He moves his hand from mine, and strokes his fingers down my cheek.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>He stares into my eyes, a serious look on his face. \u201cI thought about it after you left, what you were saying, and I talked to Stuart ... and I get where you\u2019re coming from,\u201d he sighs. \u201cI understand what you\u2019re saying, and ... I\u2019m sorry for the way I acted and the things I said. I know you chose me, and that you want to be with me. I don\u2019t even know why I said any of it.\u201d He runs his hand through his hair.</p><p>He looks nervous, confused, and totally out of his comfort zone. And I guess he is. Jake\u2019s never had to consider anyone but himself before now.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re irrational.\u201d I give him a small, teasing smile.</p><p>He nods gravely. \u201cI am, and I deserve whatever punishment you see fit to give me.\u201d</p><p>Curling my fingers into his T-shirt, I pull him into the room, shutting the door behind him, and put the flowers down on the table by the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I can come up with a suitable punishment,\u201d I murmur, cocking my head to the side.</p><p>He grins his sly grin at me and my stomach free falls.</p><p>Walking backwards, my fingers still firmly hooked into his T-shirt, I lead Jake toward the bedroom.</p><p>When we reach the bed, he grabs hold of my waist and yanks me firmly against his body and kisses me hard.</p><p>Easing me out of my vest, he drops it to the floor.</p><p>I pull his T-shirt off over his head and run my fingers over his bare chest, touching his tattoos, tracing my fingers lightly over them.</p><p>He shudders under my touch and I love the feeling.</p><p>Jake lifts me up on to the bed, and I edge backwards as he climbs over me, then leans down and begins kissing my neck.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like fighting with you,\u201d he murmurs, tracing kisses over my skin.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either, but the making up is pretty good.\u201d</p><p>Jake lifts his head, looking at me. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s awesome.\u201d</p><p>He sits up and yanks my pyjama bottoms off, and grinning over at me, he takes hold of my panties and tears them in two.</p><p>I start giggling.</p><p>Then he\u2019s cutting my laughter off when he dips his head low, using his mouth to turn my laughter into groans of his name, as he sets to work on our making up session.</p><p>\u201cWe should go out today,\u201d I say, lifting my head up from his chest.</p><p>We\u2019re laid in bed after a very long making up session, me draped across Jake, while he strokes his fingers over the skin on my back, his own skin rough and tickly on mine.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to, beautiful. We\u2019ll just stay in here, and that means I can ravish you all day long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs good as that sounds, I think we should go out.\u201d I sit up. \u201cWe can\u2019t hide away forever,\u201d I say, thinking on it. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be that day when our picture ends up in the paper, so let\u2019s just let that day be today. We\u2019re in one of the most beautiful and romantic cities in the world. We should make the most of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d he says, looking across at me hopefully.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can take my girl out on a proper first date?\u201d</p><p>Ah, so that\u2019s what this has all been about. He wanted to take me out on a first date.</p><p>And now I just love him even more if that\u2019s at all possible.</p><p>\u201cA first date sounds perfect to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I love you, Trudy Bennett,\u201d he says, pulling me back down onto him, kissing me firmly on the lips.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you, my little storm.\u201d</p><p>He pulls a face at me, eyebrow raised, then flicks his gaze downwards, to his sizeable manhood.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well maybe not small,\u201d I giggle.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more like it. Now move your hot ass off this bed and get ready. I\u2019m taking you out to show the world that you\u2019re mine.\u201d He smacks my ass with his hand.</p><p>\u201cOww!\u201d I squeal. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going!\u201d I climb off the bed, leaving Jake laying there in all his beautiful glory, as I go to take a shower.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>It took us a little while longer to get out as Jake decided to join me in the shower, and we ... um ... well, you know.</p><p>We\u2019ve decided to go to the Louvre, because neither of us has ever been and I\u2019ve always wanted to go, and I love that it\u2019s something brand new we can do together.</p><p>So we\u2019re in the back of the Merc with Dave driving us and Ben in the passenger seat.</p><p>Two lots of security are needed today apparently.</p><p>That fact makes me feel a little weird, but I\u2019m trying to push it to the back of my mind, because I\u2019m going to have to get used to this kind of thing being with Jake.</p><p>Stuart has also called ahead to let the staff at the Louvre know Jake is visiting today.</p><p>Apparently this is how it works in celeb world. You have to preannounce your arrival.</p><p>Good to know.</p><p>It\u2019s weird living like this. Pre-Jake if I wanted to go somewhere I did, without having to plan everything or bring security along for the ride.</p><p>So basically, we\u2019re going on our first date with Dave and Ben.</p><p>Kind of kills the feel of it, but I don\u2019t want to say anything to Jake and upset him, because this is life with Jake. Everything has to be structured, security with us all the time, and the places we go have to be informed in advance of his arrival.</p><p>It\u2019s a lot crazy. And it\u2019s going to take some serious getting used to.</p><p>Jake is holding my hand, running his thumb over my skin. I think he knows I\u2019m nervous about going on our first outing together as a couple.</p><p>Honestly, my stomach is popping over.</p><p>People are soon going to know I\u2019m his girlfriend. And I\u2019m going to become public enemy number one with his female fans.</p><p>My insides start to tremble, and not in a good way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dave drives the car down Avenue du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Lemonnier and enters the underground parking garage of the Louvre.

I\u2019m frozen to my seat. In truth I\u2019m scared and even more so now we\u2019re here.</p><p>I\u2019ve been living in a bubble with Jake. Our relationship this last week has been just him and I cocooned, despite all the Will stuff. Now we\u2019re about to go out in public together and everyone will know I\u2019m Jake Wethers\u2019 girlfriend, and then it won\u2019t just be him and me anymore. His world will become a part of us.</p><p>And I\u2019m worried that it might take over.</p><p>\u201cGive us a minute,\u201d Jake says to Ben, grabbing the door, he closes it.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asks, turning to me, his gaze worried.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I shrug, finding my voice. \u201cI guess it\u2019s all just got a little real now, and I don\u2019t mean us,\u201d I add at his worsening expression. \u201cI just mean you, who you are, the world you live in. The one I\u2019m about to become a part of.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me puzzled. \u201cTru, you\u2019ve known all along how my life is.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cI know, I guess ... it\u2019s just this \u2013 us going on our first date, and we have to bring Dave and Ben along with us, and Stuart has to call ahead to prepare them for your arrival \u2013 at the Louvre for god\u2019s sake! That\u2019s how famous you are, and it just feels ... a lot crazy. And a little un-date like,\u201d I add quietly, wringing my hands together in my lap.</p><p>\u201cIt is crazy, baby.\u201d He takes hold of my hands, trying to soothe my tension. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a part of my life, granted \u2013 but not all of it. I know this part isn\u2019t great and I\u2019m sorry if this doesn\u2019t feel like a date.\u201d His lips turn down at the corners. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never been on one before, so I\u2019m kind of new to all this. You\u2019re gonna have to help me out with this stuff, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll help ... I\u2019m just \u2013 I guess I\u2019m just a little scared.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat of?\u201d He looks concerned again.</p><p>\u201cThe fact that my life is going to change, majorly, by being with you, and because of that, I might not be able to do things I used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be scared.\u201d He tucks my hair behind my ear. \u201cNothing will change for you \u2013 I promise. I\u2019ll make sure your life stays exactly the same, just with the added bonus of me in it.\u201d He grins. \u201cAnd this here today is a small thing. The people who come to the Louvre won\u2019t have a care or a clue about who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah \u2018cause art fans never listen to music, Jake.\u201d I raise my eyebrow at him. \u201cEveryone knows who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone. I bet there are millions of people who don\u2019t know me. And I bet every single one of them is in the Louvre today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d I say, laughing.</p><p>\u201cTakes one to know one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does.\u201d I put my hand against his warm cheek. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you too, and everyone else will love you when they get to know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for your legions of female fans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, maybe not them,\u201d he grins.</p><p>I roll my eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cBut they will love you when they see how happy you make me ... and you do, Tru \u2013 make me happy \u2013 you always did. I don\u2019t know how I coped all those years without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJonny,\u201d I say gently.</p><p>He looks down.</p><p>\u201cHey, I didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\u201d I put my fingers under his chin, touching his scar, as I lift his head.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d He meets my eyes. \u201cIt just makes me sad that Jonny\u2019s never going to get the chance to feel about a girl, like I do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re just gonna have to live it twice as large for him.\u201d I lean in and kiss his lips gently. \u201cCome on, superstar. Let\u2019s get this show on the road.\u201d</p><p>Jake holds my hand tightly, as we walk toward the lift, us being led by the attendant and Dave, with Ben walking behind us.</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m under armed guard because I\u2019m carrying a precious cargo into the Louvre.</p><p>It\u2019s so surreal.</p><p>We all ride up in the lift in silence. It\u2019s making me a little fidgety.</p><p>We get out on the first floor, and standing outside the lift is a smartly dressed man, tall, dark wavy hair, and obviously waiting for us.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wethers,\u201d he says, stepping forward as we exit the lift. \u201cI\u2019m Alexander Baudin. It is very good to meet you. We are absolutely delighted to have you visit us here at the Louvre today.\u201d</p><p>His English is excellent, although heavily accented and very sexy sounding.</p><p>Jake shakes his outstretched hand. \u201cCall me Jake, please, and this is my girlfriend, Trudy Bennett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely to meet you, Ms. Bennett,\u201d Alexander Baudin says, taking hold of my hand to shake.</p><p>\u201cSo what were you looking to see today?\u201d Alexander Baudin asks, walking forward. We follow.</p><p>\u201cThis wing of the Louvre we are currently in is where some of our many prints, drawings and paintings are home too. The likes of The Young Beggar, and of course our resident lady, the Mona Lisa.\u201d He turns, smiling at us. \u201cI am happy to accompany you today, give you a guided tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for the offer, but we\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Jake says, coming to a stop. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re a busy man and I don\u2019t want to interrupt your day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is no problem,\u201d Alexander Baudin smiles.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the offer,\u201d Jake says kindly, leaning closer to him. \u201cBut I\u2019m here on a date with my girl, and we have enough company as it is.\u201d Jake tilts his head in Dave and Ben\u2019s direction, who are loitering nearby.</p><p>\u201cAh, I understand,\u201d Alexander Baudin says in a lowered voice, nodding. \u201cHere is a guide of the Louvre.\u201d He pulls a leaflet from the inside of his jacket pocket and hands it to Jake.</p><p>\u201cI hope the both of you enjoy your day here, and if you need anything at all, please let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will, thanks,\u201d Jake says.</p><p>Alexander Baudin smiles at us both once more, and departs.</p><p>\u201cOkay, baby, so where to first?\u201d Jake says, opening out the guide for the Louvre.</p><p>We\u2019ve been in the Louvre for just over an hour looking at paintings. We haven\u2019t got very far because there are so many, and I keep getting stuck, because some of them are truly amazing, so very beautiful, and I\u2019ve been feeling quite emotional just looking at them.</p><p>It makes me wish I could create something so wonderful.</p><p>I don\u2019t think Jake\u2019s as taken with them as I am though. If the wall was covered with guitars he\u2019d probably be more interested, but I love that he\u2019s showing a keen interest for me.</p><p>And he\u2019s being so lovely, so attentive, constantly touching me, holding my hand, and I\u2019m having the best time with him.</p><p>I\u2019m just ignoring the fact that Dave and Ben are following us, and that we are getting stares from people who either recognise Jake immediately, or recognise him but are not sure where from.</p><p>It\u2019s not too horrendous; weird, but bearable.</p><p>I hear a phone ringing, and turning, I see Dave pulling his phone from his pocket.</p><p>He turns away from us to take the call.</p><p>I focus back on the painting in front of me, \u2018Woman With A Mirror\u2019.</p><p>\u201cThis painting is so beautiful,\u201d I say to Jake. \u201cI think it\u2019s my favourite so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as beautiful as you,\u201d he whispers in my ear from behind, sliding his arms around my waist.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a charmer,\u201d I laugh, resting my head back against his chest.</p><p>\u201cJake,\u201d Dave comes over. \u201cThat was Stuart on the phone. There\u2019s some pictures of you and Tru, here in the Louvre which have just hit the networking sites, and they're doing the rounds, making it to the paps sites. I just wanted to let you know things could get a little busy when we\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jake says, sighing.</p><p>\u201cWhat does he mean \u2013 busy?\u201d I turn to face Jake.</p><p>\u201cIt means there\u2019s a high probability there will be paparazzi waiting for us outside when we leave.\u201d</p><p>My stomach knots.</p><p>\u201cHow did they get pictures of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCamera phones, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotta love technology.\u201d There goes our lovely date.</p><p>I start to chew on my lip.</p><p>\u201cShould we leave now?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jake shakes his head. \u201cJust forget about it, I want to keep enjoying my day with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if we get mobbed?\u201d My voice has gone a little shrill. In all honesty, I\u2019m starting to freak out.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t get mobbed,\u201d he chuckles, tucking my hair behind my ear. \u201cAnd if we did, that\u2019s what Dave and Ben are here for. They\u2019re very good at their job, Tru. The best in the business, and that\u2019s why I have them working for me. You\u2019re completely safe, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t feel safe. I suddenly feel exposed and vulnerable.</p><p>Is this how it\u2019s always going to feel? The thought haunts me a little.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Jake says, taking me by the hand. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot more of this place to see.\u201d</p><p>I let him lead me along, but I\u2019m not interested in the paintings anymore. I just feel tense and have visions of getting mobbed by hoards of screaming girls and the paparazzi, and I can\u2019t let go of the feeling.</p><p>After another fifteen minutes and a little further into the Louvre, I\u2019m starting to notice the volume of people near us increasing.</p><p>Dave and Ben obviously notice too, as they have moved in closer to us.</p><p>Where we had space before, now we have very little.</p><p>I can feel Jake getting tense.</p><p>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because the attention gathering is bothering him, I think he\u2019s frustrated because he knows it\u2019s bothering me, and he just wanted us to have today together.</p><p>Our first date together, we are now sharing with not only Dave and Ben, but about fifty other people.</p><p>A member of the security staff from the Louvre comes over and speaks quietly to Dave.</p><p>The security guy stands back, staying with us, and that only causes to make me feel even more edgy than I already do.</p><p>Dave makes a quick call, then comes over and speaks into Jake\u2019s ear.</p><p>Jake moves back away from me to listen to what Dave has to say.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to focus on the painting before me, but I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t even know what this one is called. I\u2019ve barely taken it in.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to ignore the eyes around me, but my whole body feels like it\u2019s on fire, burning under their scrutiny.</p><p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019m cut out for this.</p><p>I hear Jake sigh loudly, then see him nod his head to Dave.</p><p>He comes over to me, standing in front of me, he takes my hands and says in a quiet voice, \u201cBaby, the paps are here, outside ... they\u2019ve somehow found out which car is ours in the parking garage, and ... there\u2019s a load of them waiting out there for us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough. And the loitering has obviously brought some attention, and well ... now the crowd has grown because people know it\u2019s me in here.\u201d He sounds really uncomfortable and embarrassed saying this to me.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cThe staff here are trying to clear the parking lot, but Dave has called Stuart and he\u2019s on his way to come collect us now in the other car.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about this, Tru.\u201d He puts his hand on my face, but I can\u2019t even enjoy the feel of his skin on mine, because I\u2019m so conscious of the fact that people are staring.</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m in a zoo and I'm truly on the wrong side of the fence.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I say trying to keep my voice even. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. This is just how things are. I understand. Come on let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I take hold of Jake\u2019s hand, and we start to walk through the Louvre following Dave. Ben is behind us, the museum\u2019s staff with us too.</p> <p>People are following us, and stopping to stare as we pass by.</p><p>Honestly, it makes me want to break out into a sprint.</p><p>All these beautiful things here in the Louvre and all people seem to want to do is stare at Jake.</p><p>I get he\u2019s beautiful. I want to stare at him all day long too, but it\u2019s just plain rude to stare so blatantly, and to follow him ... us ... when we are clearly out together for the day, without any recrimination whatsoever.</p><p>I hold on a little tighter to Jake\u2019s hand. He squeezes it, giving me a small, uneasy small.</p><p>He\u2019s feeling bad that we\u2019re having to leave, and I know he\u2019s worried as to how I feel about it, especially after what we talked about in the car just before we arrived.</p> <p>How do I feel?</p><p>Stressed, a bit panicky, annoyed that we can\u2019t even go on a simple day out together without attracting the crazy.</p><p>Is this how it\u2019s always going to be?</p><p>I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m cut out for this. It\u2019s scary as to the level of attention Jake receives.</p><p>We reach the main door and Dave pushes it open, then I\u2019m hit with some camera flashes. There are paparazzi out here.</p><p>I thought they were in the parking lot? How the hell did they know we\u2019d be coming out this way?</p><p>\u201cSo you two are together then? Are you finally settling down Jake? Is Trudy the one?\u201d</p><p>The voices are coming from left, right and centre.</p> <p>Jesus Christ, this is insane.</p><p>I keep my head down. Jake\u2019s arm is around me now, tight, holding me to him. Dave is on Jake\u2019s right, arm on him guiding us over to Stuart\u2019s waiting car. Ben is at my side, staying close to me.</p><p>\u201cTrudy! Look this way gorgeous, let us see your face!\u201d</p><p>I need to get out of here. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt as uneasy in all my life as I do right now.</p><p>I tilt my head further down, practically tucking my chin into my chest.</p><p>The next thing I know, we\u2019re at the car. Dave has the door open and Jake is guiding me in. I shuffle along sitting behind the passenger seat, and then Jake quickly climbs in behind me.</p><p>Dave shuts the door, pushing some paps out of the way in the process. Ben climbs in the passenger seat and then Stuart\u2019s driving us away, pretty quickly.</p><p>My heart is bumping around my chest.</p><p>I turn in my seat looking out the back window, worrying the paparazzi might be following.</p><p>I can\u2019t see any suspicious looking cars, but then there\u2019s plenty around. And I\u2019m thankful in this moment that the windows are so heavily tinted in this car.</p><p>Jake takes hold of my hand, pulling my attention to him, and it\u2019s only then I realise my hand is shaking.</p><p>\u201cHey, are you okay?\u201d His voice is soft and soothing. He takes hold of my chin, forcing my eyes to his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d My mouth\u2019s dry. I moisten my lips with my tongue. \u201cThat was just ... um ... a little crazy.\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cIs it always like that when you go out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot always, no,\u201d he shakes his head. \u201cThat was a little more hectic than normal, but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s because you\u2019re with me, and the press will be after a picture of us together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the ones on Twitter weren\u2019t enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it though, Jake. You\u2019ve been out with women before, that\u2019s not exactly a rarity.\u201d</p><p>That sounded a little shittier than I intended.</p><p>He gives me a look. \u201cNo, Tru. I\u2019ve fallen out of clubs with women before. I\u2019ve never taken anyone out on date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did they even know we were on a date?\u201d My voice is shrill again.</p><p>\u201cWell, baby.\u201d He tucks my hair behind my ear, and I\u2019m relieved to his touch. \u201cAnyone who took one look at us together could have easily worked that out \u2013 figured out that I\u2019m crazy about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we only started seeing each other properly yesterday!\u201d</p><p>Okay, so I\u2019m freaking out a little \u2013 a lot.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take them long, Tru. You\u2019re in this business, you know how it works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might be a journo, but I am nothing like them!\u201d I say with indignation.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant, and you know it.\u201d He gives me a look. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, you work at a magazine, you see how things are with celebrities. My life is not private in a lot of ways, no matter how much I try to keep it as such. And this is their job \u2013 the paps. They make their living off the shit going on in my life, and the lives of other celebs. It\u2019s just how things are. Not all the time, but a lot of it, and if something happens in my life \u2013 like me being out on a date ... the possibility of me having a girlfriend, well then the media becomes interested ... interested in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m no one special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are to me.\u201d His voice is intense. \u201cYou\u2019re everything to me,\u201d he adds in a lower tone. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry this hasn\u2019t been a first date, like a first date should be.\u201d He cups my cheek with his hand. \u201cI will make it up to you, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Then looking at Jake here, before me, him staring back at me in earnest, filled with love for me, I feel suddenly overwhelmed by my feelings for him, and at the depth of those feelings. And momentarily forgetting that Stuart and Ben are in the front of the car, only a few feet away, I lean forward and kiss him, hard.</p><p>Parting my lips under his, I let his tongue move into my mouth, and then I feel it pass between us. The energy, the desire, and I start to feel that stirring in my body that only he can create.</p><p>I want him, right here and now.</p><p>I know he feels it too as he groans a little sound in my mouth. Jake grabs a firm hold of my hair, kissing me even harder.</p><p>It takes a long moment, but I do eventually become very aware of the fact that Stuart and Ben are in the front of the car, especially when Jake\u2019s hand goes to my leg, and starts to move higher.</p><p>Knowing for sure they don\u2019t want a Jake and Tru, porn show, I pull back from him.</p><p>Jake looks at me disappointed. I flick my eyes in the direction of the front of the car. I\u2019m really glad the radio is on fairly loud, which will have drowned out the sound of our kissing. But even so, my cheeks have flamed with embarrassment at my loss of control over Jake.</p><p>He smiles and leans close again, running his nose up the sensitive skin on my neck, he reaches my ear and whispers, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get you back to the hotel ... I am going to undress you, slowly ... and I\u2019m going to kiss you, everywhere.\u201d</p><p>I can feel his words, down there, and that heat rises again in my belly. I love how he makes me feel.</p><p>\u201cTe quiero,\u201d I whisper back to him.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Tru,\u201d he groans quietly in my ear, his breath hot on my skin. \u201cYou know what that does to me. If you keep talking like that I don\u2019t give a shit who is in this car with us, I\u2019ll take you right here and now, on the back seat.\u201d</p><p>His words do crazy things to me and I\u2019m feeling turned on and suddenly reckless.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m still pumped up with adrenaline after what just happened at the Louvre, or because of how much I do love him, but I suddenly have the urge to turn him on, to challenge him.</p><p>\u201cJoder, Jake ... that\u2019s what I want to do with you, now,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>He knows exactly what I\u2019m saying to him. That is one Spanish word he does know.</p><p>I feel him stiffen beside me.</p><p>I flicker a glance in Stuart\u2019s direction, seeing his eyes are on the road. Ben is talking on his phone, speaking to Dave presumably.</p><p>So shifting back in my seat, I move closer to the door, turning my body toward him, and run my fingers up my thigh, lifting my skirt up, ever so slightly, I part my legs.</p><p>Jake sharps in a breath. His eyes are on me and they're glowing.</p><p>I love this sense of power I have over him right now. It\u2019s exhilarating.</p><p>I stare at him, meeting his hot gaze and moisten my lips with my tongue.</p><p>Smiling seductively at Jake, I lower my skirt back down, pressing my legs together, feeling proud of my little wanton moment thinking, my work here is done, well until the hotel that is, but Jake shakes his head, no.</p><p>My legs start to tremble.</p><p>He moves closer, positioning himself beside me, and puts his foot up on the rest between the front seats, covering any possible view of my legs with his. Jake rests his hand on my lap, then very gently pushes my legs apart with his hand and I let him.</p><p>My heart is thudding in my chest and my mouth suddenly dry.</p><p>Jake slides his hand under my skirt, reaching my panties he hooks his fingers into them, moving them aside, giving him the access he wants, he starts to touch me. Then very gently, he slips his finger inside me.</p><p>My whole body nearly explodes. I have to bite my lip, hard, to stop myself from making a noise.</p><p>I turn my face to his. He stares back at me. His eyes daring, pooling and heated.</p><p>I have never in all my life done anything like this. And I know I should care there are other people in the car with us, but it\u2019s hard to right now. All I care about is Jake and the way he\u2019s making me feel.</p><p>He starts to move his finger, in and out, in a rhythmic motion, his thumb rubbing over me, and my heart is beating so hard, my legs shaking uncontrollably, and I know what\u2019s going to happen if he doesn\u2019t stop.</p><p>\u201cJake, stop, or I\u2019m going to come,\u201d I mouth to him.</p><p>He grins, and rubs his thumb a little firmer over my hot spot.</p><p>My body shudders.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I mouth again, pressing my legs together, onto his hand.</p><p>He grins again, seemingly satisfied with himself and the effect he\u2019s had on me, and slips his hand out from under my skirt, then rearranges his very noticeable erection in his pants, with his hand.</p><p>I\u2019m relieved and disappointed at the same time.</p><p>And I have a good mind to do the same to him, work him up to the point of near combustion.</p><p>Stuart pulls up out front of the hotel a few minutes later and I\u2019m still struggling to gather my cloudy, but very horny thoughts.</p><p>I\u2019m so worked up and desperate to relieve the ache Jake has left me with, that I\u2019m just about ready to do it anywhere with him.</p><p>Once we\u2019re out of the car, Jake grabs hold of my hand leading me straight into the hotel, practically dragging me through the lobby and into a waiting lift. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once the doors are closed he pushes me up against the wall, his mouth on mine, hard and fast, and his hands are everywhere.</p><p>Then, before I know it, the lift doors are pinging open on our floor, and Jake\u2019s pulling me down the hall, unlocking the door to his suite, and then we are finally alone.</p><p>Jake starts to walk toward me but I back off.</p><p>Payback time mister.</p> <p>He cocks his head to the side, staring at me a little puzzled and very curious.</p><p>\u201cStay there,\u201d I breathe.</p><p>I\u2019ve never really been this confident sexually. I\u2019m more of a straight to the basics kind of girl.

But I do. I want to do it for him, because of him.</p><p>Jake makes me feel confident ... and so very sexy.</p> <p>I\u2019m feeling pretty glad right now that I\u2019m wearing my good underwear, as I start to unbutton my shirt, slowly, one button at a time.</p><p>I watch Jake\u2019s eyes as they follow my hands down.</p><p>I slide my shirt off, down my arms, letting it fall to the floor.</p><p>Then I kick my heels off, and unbutton my skirt at the back, slowly easing the zip down. I shimmy it over my hips, then let it fall to the floor and step out of it.</p><p>Now I\u2019m just standing here in just my black lacy underwear.</p><p>Jake\u2019s eyes are on fire, devouring me, and he looks like he\u2019s about to pounce any second now.</p> <p>I run my hand down my stomach and hook a thumb into the elastic of my panties, slowly inching them down over my hips.</p><p>Jake\u2019s breathing is shallow. His eyes fixed on my hand, watching, waiting.</p><p>He puts his hand on the stretch in his jeans, adjusting himself, obviously feeling the discomfort in his pants.</p><p>I stop pulling my panties down, changing my mind, and bring them back up to rest on my hips.</p><p>He cocks his head to the side.</p><p>Slowly, I walk over to him.</p><p>My heart is pumping hard in my chest. I\u2019ve got a heat in my belly, and I\u2019m flushed all over.</p><p>Jake grabs hold of my hips pulling me hard against him the instant I\u2019m within his reach.</p> <p>Shaking my head at him, I remove his hands off my hips and step back a little.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cI want you now.\u201d His tone is urgent, intense. It travels through me, hitting me in just the right spot.</p><p>I lean close to his ear and whisper, \u201cYo voy a chupar.\u201d</p><p>He sharps out a breath. \u201cFuck, Tru,\u201d he growls. \u201cIf you want me to wait you\u2019re not going about it the right way.\u201d</p><p>Moving back, I smile at him, snagging my lower lip with my teeth.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you just said? I need to know.\u201d His words are breathy, ragged.</p><p>I love that I can do this to him with just words.</p><p>\u201cLet me show you,\u201d I say, dropping to my knees before him.</p><p>Then I\u2019m undoing his jeans, freeing him, and showing him just exactly what I meant.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you tell me where we\u2019re going?\u201d I ask Jake again, turning in my seat to face him.</p><p>He flickers a glance at me. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is everything always a surprise with you?\u201d</p><p>He slows the car to a stop at the red traffic light.</p><p>\u201cBecause I like seeing the look on your face when you discover what the surprise is.\u201d He reaches over and strokes my cheek with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cYou would still get the surprised look even if you told me you know \u2013 I\u2019m great at surprised faces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure you are,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cBut still, it just doesn\u2019t equal the look of seeing it in your eyes, as you see it for the first time.\u201d</p><p>Huh? Well now I\u2019m just confused.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so what if I told you I don\u2019t like surprises.\u201d I fold my arms across my chest.</p><p>\u201cWell you haven\u2019t seemed to mind them so far,\u201d he says confidently, shifting the car back into drive as the light changes to green. \u201cAnd you definitely didn\u2019t seem to mind the one I gave you earlier.\u201d</p><p>My cheeks instantly flush.</p><p>Memories of Jake sneaking up behind me when I was in the bathroom, brushing my teeth, getting ready to come out tonight ... and then I was coming, but in a whole different way.</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah I did like that one,\u201d I grin across at him, unfurling my arms.</p><p>\u201cSee surprises can be good.\u201d He takes hold of my hand and kisses it then rests it back down so he can signal his turn.</p><p>Earlier was amazing, but I think it was also Jake\u2019s way of cushioning the blow, pardon the pun, because after we made love; he\u2019d had some of those amazing cakes delivered as we never did get to go to the delicatessens, and while we were sat in bed feeding each other cake, he told me that the pictures of me and him leaving the Louvre had hit the tabloids in full colour glory telling the world we\u2019re together. They also know Jake and I grew up together. That we used to live next-door to one another and had been best friends growing up.</p><p>So now the whole world knows pretty much everything about Jake and I.</p><p>Except they don\u2019t know we had an affair.</p><p>They don\u2019t know I still had a boyfriend when we started seeing each other. They haven\u2019t locked onto that little piece of information, yet, and I hope they never do. For Will\u2019s sake as much as my own.</p><p>The word is that Jake has found \"the one\". His girl next-door.</p><p>It\u2019s sweet, in an intrusive, weird kind of way.</p><p>Jake was worried how I\u2019d feel because of my privacy concerns, and because of how I had wanted to spare Will\u2019s feelings as much as possible.</p><p>I reassured him I was fine with it all. It was bound to hit the press one day, so sooner rather than later.</p><p>So now it\u2019s out, Jake and I can get on with just enjoying one another.</p><p>I stare out through the heavily tinted window looking at Paris all around me. I feel like I\u2019m the luckiest girl in the world to be with Jake. To have him back in my life, and for us to finally be together.</p><p>And for him to love me back, like I\u2019ve always loved him.</p><p>If only we\u2019d told one another how we felt when we were younger, maybe we would never have lost touch. Maybe we would have always been together, and Jake would never have had the drug problem and I would have been there for him when Jonny died.</p><p>It\u2019s sad to think we\u2019ve missed out on so many years together, but we have each other now and that\u2019s what matters.</p><p>So, I have no idea where I\u2019m going tonight, which is a tad frustrating, but the flip side is that it\u2019s just Jake and I tonight. He told Dave and Ben to stay at the hotel.</p><p>I know, I couldn\u2019t believe it either.</p><p>Dave was not comfortable with Jake going out alone. But Jake is the boss and what he says goes. He can be pretty authoritative when he wants to be. And it\u2019s really very sexy to see in action. I might let him be all authoritative with me in bed later tonight.</p><p>I know why Jake wanted to go out alone with me. He\u2019s trying to give me a normal night out after today\u2019s escapade at the Louvre. Trying to prove to me that life can be normal with him at times.</p><p>So there\u2019s no Dave following us. Just Jake and I in his new hire car, a two-seater black BMW Z4.</p><p>It\u2019s a sexy car, just like its driver.</p><p>Jake had it delivered earlier for us to go out in tonight, and Stuart has also changed the Merc\u2019s, so now Jake\u2019s got Audi\u2019s for the remainder of his stay.</p><p>However long that will be.</p><p>We haven\u2019t talked about going home yet. I know I have to go home soon, as I need to get back to the magazine and do some work before the US leg of the tour starts. But I\u2019m reluctant to bring the subject up because I don\u2019t want to leave him yet, if ever.</p><p>Every time I think about being without Jake, I get this awful strangling, tightening sensation in my tummy.</p><p>So for now, I\u2019m not thinking about it.</p><p>Jake takes the next turn, taking us down the Rue de la Paix.</p><p>He pulls the car over just outside Tiffany\u2019s and turns the engine off.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d I ask, a little frisson of energy bursting in my tummy.</p><p>Of course I have an idea, well a hope, of what we\u2019re doing here, but I have to ask just to be sure.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I need to pick up,\u201d he answers.</p><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d</p><p>My little glimmer of sparkly hope vanishes.</p><p>Of course, I don\u2019t want Jake spending lots of money on me, but if he ever felt the need to buy me something pretty from Tiffany\u2019s then I wouldn\u2019t take total offence to it.</p><p>I\u2019ve always wanted jewellery from Tiffany\u2019s.</p><p>A: Because I love Audrey Hepburn and wanted to be her for a while when I was younger, well I still kind of do.</p><p>B: I love the song.</p><p>But mainly C: Because the jewellery is just so ridiculously beautiful, but it\u2019s also, so very out of my price range.</p><p>Anyway, he\u2019s here to pick something up, and that\u2019s cool.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s something for his mum. He did speak to her on the phone earlier.</p><p>He told her about him and me.</p><p>Apparently, she\u2019s really pleased and is looking forward to seeing me again.</p><p>Honestly, the thought makes me nervous. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ll be seeing Susie again after all these years as Jake\u2019s girlfriend, and not just his friend.</p><p>I climb out of the car and Jake meets me around the other side.</p><p>Luckily, the streets are fairly quiet tonight, as I don\u2019t fancy another mobbing like we had earlier.</p><p>Jake takes hold of my hand and we walk toward Tiffany\u2019s.</p><p>I\u2019ve been in a Tiffany\u2019s store before, of course. Looked around then left before I either killed my visa or cried.</p><p>The closed sign is up on the door, but the place is all lit up, and I can see a man walking toward the door.</p><p>They\u2019ve kept the place open late for Jake.</p><p>Oh, the power of money and status.</p><p>We\u2019re greeted at the door by the man inside who identifies himself as Devin.</p><p>Devin is well groomed and very attractive. He reminds me of Stuart in a way. I wonder if he\u2019s gay...</p><p>\u201cYour piece is ready for you,\u201d Devin is saying to Jake as we follow him over to the brightly lit, glossy, sparkly counter.</p><p>But I\u2019m barely listening. It\u2019s so damn pretty in here. My head is swivelling on my neck.</p><p>It looks even fancier than the one on Bond Street back home. It probably isn\u2019t, it\u2019s just because it\u2019s here in amazing Paris that I think so.</p><p>More than anything, I want to visit Tiffany &amp; Co. in New York. The original and the best.</p><p>One day Tru, one day.</p><p>I\u2019m getting distracted, there\u2019s just so much to look at, and my fingers are itching to touch things.</p><p>A display of rings to my left catches my eye, so I drop Jake\u2019s hand and wander over to have a look, leaving him to get his \u2018piece\u2019.</p><p>The thought makes me want to giggle. I\u2019m so immature at times.</p><p>My eyes roam the gems in the glass case, white diamonds, sapphires, yellow diamonds, and oh my god, a pink diamond. A freaking pink diamond! I didn\u2019t even know you could get pink diamonds!</p><p>I\u2019m actually freaking out a little here. Because this has to be the most beautiful ring I have ever seen in my whole entire twenty-six years on this plant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s platinum with a pear-shaped pink diamond and a single row of round brilliant white diamonds hugging it.</p><p>I think I may have just died and gone to girlie heaven.</p><p>I\u2019d sell my Grandma to have this ring that\u2019s how amazing it is. Of course I\u2019d never tell her that, she\u2019d have my hide if I did.</p><p>My eyes scan around for a price for the ring, but there isn\u2019t one, which means it\u2019s ridiculously expensive.</p> <p>Like I could have ever afforded it anyway. I can\u2019t even afford moderately priced Tiffany\u2019s. Not even cheap Tiffany\u2019s, if there is such a thing.</p><p>That ring will be worth more than I can earn in a lifetime.</p><p>\u201cSee anything you like?\u201d Jake says in a husky voice from behind me.</p><p>Without thinking, I say in my still dreamy state, \u201cLook at that ring, it\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d pointing my finger to it.</p><p>Then I realise, smack bang, how it will look to Jake that I\u2019m standing here, gazing dreamy eyed at pink diamond rings, which actually looks a lot like an engagement ring, and I\u2019m pointing said ring out to him, in a dreamy sounding voice.</p> <p>I\u2019m such a girl at times.</p><p>\u201cUm ... I mean it\u2019s nice, you know, as rings go ... so did you get what you came for?\u201d I ask, abruptly changing the subject.</p><p>I turn away from the dream ring to face him.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d He pats his jacket pocket looking pretty happy with himself.</p><p>Jake looks absolutely delicious tonight. And very smart. He\u2019s dressed in blue jeans, but he\u2019s wearing a shirt and a suit jacket with them. It shouldn\u2019t work but it does on him, and he looks so very hot.</p><p>I\u2019m wearing my sleeveless, floral print dress. It\u2019s fitted at the waist, and has a cut out back. It\u2019s pretty, with a real sexiness about it. I\u2019ve teamed it with my cream heels. And my hair is down and curly, just as Jake likes it.</p> <p>He takes hold of my hand and opening the door for me, I exit first, leaving Tiffany\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cBye sparkly,\u201d I murmur quietly to myself.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Jake asks.</p><p>\u201cUm ... what? Nothing.\u201d My face flushes scarlet, and I quick march to the car, leaving Jake to chuckle softly behind me.</p><p>I\u2019ve just got in the car and put my seatbelt on, when I turn to Jake, wondering why he hasn\u2019t started the car yet and see a Tiffany\u2019s box sitting on the armrest separating me and him.</p><p>My heart does a little dance in my chest.</p><p>I look from the box to him.</p><p>\u201cI got you a little something,\u201d he says, looking, surprisingly nervous.</p> <p>\u201cIs that what you went in there to pick up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh huh,\u201d he nods.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d My insides are doing cartwheels at the moment, but I\u2019m keeping a poker face on. I don\u2019t want to come across as the girlie idiot I truly am.</p><p>He smiles, chuckling lightly. \u201cOpen it and find out.\u201d</p><p>I reach forward and pick the box up. Cracking it open, I find inside the most beautiful necklace I\u2019ve ever seen. Ever.</p><p>It\u2019s a platinum heart locket pendant, with a heart shaped diamond set in the centre.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe he bought me this. I think I may actually cry.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful, Jake,\u201d I breathe.</p><p>\u201cOpen it up,\u201d he points his chin at the locket.</p><p>I remove the locket from the box, putting it back down on the armrest. Then using my fingernail, I pop the locket open.</p><p>I gasp. The smile on my face has just reached maximum size.</p><p>\u201cYour dad sent me the picture,\u201d he says, looking shy. I love shy Jake. \u201cThe other is from the after show party in Sweden.\u201d</p><p>Printed inside the locket are two pictures of Jake and I. One from when we were toddlers. We must be three years old max, and the other is from the after show party in Sweden like he said.</p><p>Overcome with emotion, I launch myself at him. Kissing him hard and passionately on the mouth, knotting my fingers into his hair, holding him to me. Jake kisses me back as equally passionate, his hand cupped around the back of my neck, holding me to him, his tongue roaming my mouth, moving with mine.</p><p>\u201cSo you like it then?\u201d he whispers into my mouth as our kissing slows.</p><p>\u201cI love it, and I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBirthday present number three,\u201d he murmurs, brushing my hair back off my face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still yet to get you anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got all my twelve the moment you agreed to be mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knew you were such a hopeless romantic, Jake Wethers.\u201d Smiling, I trace my fingertip over his lips. The light bruise from his fight with Will still evident there.</p><p>It\u2019s crazy to believe that was only yesterday morning. It feels like we\u2019ve done so much together since then.</p><p>\u201cOnly with you I am. And I\u2019m also horny twenty-four-seven.\u201d He runs his hand up my thigh, pushing the hem of my dress up with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell we\u2019re not doing it here, in the car on the street, Pervy Perverson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPervy Perverson?\u201d Jake splutters out a laugh.</p><p>\u201cFriends \u2013 you never watched?\u201d I say at his puzzled expression.</p><p>\u201cNo, dork, I was too busy touring and earning a living, while you were bumming around at uni watching soaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your face, and put my necklace on PP,\u201d I grin at him.</p><p>Jake holds his hand out for the necklace, so I place it in his palm.</p><p>I turn away from him, moving my long hair away from my neck.</p><p>Jake places the cool metal around my neck, and catches the fastener at the back. His hands linger on my shoulders, and then I feel the touch of his warm lips on the nape of my neck.</p><p>It sends shivers running down my spine.</p><p>I reach my hand back, touching his thigh, and lean myself into him.</p><p>He smells and feels amazing, and a heat starts to rise in my body, pooling in my belly. And now I\u2019m turned on.</p><p>I start to inch my fingers up his thigh.</p><p>Jake catches hold of my hand. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing it here, MP.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMP?\u201d I turn, looking at him puzzled.</p><p>\u201cMrs Perverson,\u201d he smirks, then leaving me cold, he starts the car, puts his belt on and pulls out into the road.</p><p>Mrs? Hmm... I\u2019m liking the sound of that.</p><p>Mrs. Trudy Wethers.</p><p>Has quite a ring to it if you ask me. Not now of course. But then Jake\u2019s not exactly the marrying kind is he.</p><p>The thought makes me feel a little sad.</p><p>\u201cWhere to now?\u201d I ask, ignoring my own crashing wedding bells, and instead try to poker some info out of him.</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s time birthday present number four.\u201d</p><p>Jake pulls the car up on the main road, a stretch away from the Eiffel Tour. It is a little busier around here of course. Tourists are all around.</p><p>Out of my window, I see a young guy waiting by the roadside, and I instantly know he\u2019s here waiting for us.</p><p>\u201cCome on, baby,\u201d Jake says climbing out of the car.</p><p>By the time I\u2019m out of the car, the star-struck young guy is taking the car keys from Jake and is walking around to the driver\u2019s side with a huge smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t just give the car to a random stranger did you?\u201d I ask, smirking.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he chuckles, gently swotting my behind with his hand. \u201cHe works for the place we\u2019re going to. He\u2019s going to go park the car for us ... he\u2019ll probably joy ride it first \u2013 can't say I blame him because I would if I was him \u2013 but as long as it\u2019s back for when we need it, I\u2019m cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww, you\u2019re so sweet, baby, letting the teenager go for a joyride in the hire car.\u201d I nudge him with my hip. \u201cAnd you\u2019re also silly, romantic, and looking very hot tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He turns to me, that lusty Jake fire in his eyes again. \u201cAnd you\u2019re beautiful and insanely sexy, and right now I want to peel that dress off you and do dirty things to you right here and now in the street, but I think we might get arrested if I do.\u201d</p><p>I press my legs together, trying to control the tremble in them he\u2019s just created with his words.</p><p>\u201cLater?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, most definitely,\u201d he nods. \u201cNow come on, beautiful, let\u2019s get moving before I starting getting stopped for autographs.\u201d He does a quick, comical glance around, then holds his arm out for me to take.</p><p>I link my arm through his, boxing up my sudden urges for later, and we start to walk down the Parisian street together just like any other normal couple, heading in the direction of the Eiffel Tower.</p><p>I feel relaxed and happy, and not at all worried that we\u2019re going to get mobbed by TMS fans.</p><p>If people are looking at us, I don\u2019t even notice, because I\u2019m too busy staring at Jake, drinking him in.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks, staring down at me.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019m just happy.\u201d I rest my head against his shoulder as we walk.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d he murmurs, kissing the top of my head.</p><p>As we near the Eiffel Tower, I look up, and get a feeling of vertigo from the sheer height of it.</p><p>\u201cWow, it\u2019s so amazing,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s pretty cool, isn\u2019t it,\u201d Jake says, following my gaze skywards.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been here before?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve been to Paris?\u201d I haven\u2019t. It\u2019s my first time here. I\u2019ve always been more of an Ibiza girl.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been quite a few times,\u201d he replies.</p><p>\u201cSo why have you never visited here, or the Louvre come to think of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was saving them for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stop walking. We\u2019re just under the tower now.</p><p>Jake turns to face me, sliding his arms around my waist, pulling me close.</p><p>\u201cI knew one day I would eventually see you again, and I knew when that day came I wasn\u2019t letting you go for anything. And these were the things I wanted to do with you when I had you back. No one else, just you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were waiting for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Holy fuck.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if fate had decided we were never to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there would never have been anyone else. There is no one else for me.

He sounds like he\u2019s slipping off into a coma.</p> <p>\u201cYou got a camera phone, kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJ-Johnny,\u201d he says coming to life a little, scrabbling to dig his phone out of his pocket. \u201cMy name\u2019s Johnny.\u201d He hands Jake his phone without a second thought.</p><p>\u201cGreat name,\u201d Jakes smiles.</p><p>\u201cTru, would you mind?\u201d Jake turns to me, holding the phone out for me to take.</p><p>\u201cSure no prob,\u201d I smile.</p><p>I take the phone from Jake and set the camera on. I take a photo of Jake and Johnny the kid, and then hand the camera back to him.</p> <p>\u201cTh-thanks,\u201d Johnny says to me.</p><p>He turns and stares at Jake again. He looks like he has a million things he wants to say to Jake, but they\u2019re all stuck in his head. Poor kid.</p><p>I know the feeling all too well.</p><p>\u201cTh-thanks for the p-picture,\u201d he stumbles out.</p><p>\u201cAnytime ... and remember, not a word.\u201d Jake winks at him, then takes my hand and leads me inside the door.</p><p>\u201cI think that poor kid was in a state of shock,\u201d I giggle, as we walk into the lift together.</p><p>Jake\u2019s hired hand is here to accompany us for the ride up.</p><p>\u201cI think you might be right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was a nice thing you did back there, baby.\u201d I squeeze his hand.</p><p>\u201cJust doing my bit for mankind.\u201d</p><p>I look at him puzzled.</p><p>\u201cTru, that picture of him with me, will help that kid get laid, or if not at least get a girl to play with his dick, and that\u2019s all that counts when you\u2019re a teenager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d He leans in close and whispers in my ear, \u201cThat\u2019s what I was hoping for at Lumb Falls all those years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, my pulse quickening as the memories flood my brain, but this time in a whole new light.</p><p>Letting go of my hand, Jake reaches behind me, resting his hand against my ass, he cups it with his fingers. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to go back there one day and you can do all the things to me I missed out on back then.\u201d</p><p>I gulp down. Sex with Jake under a waterfall.</p><p>Holy hell.</p><p>Before I get a chance to respond, the lift doors ping open, and on seriously wobbly legs, I follow Jake out and find myself in the foyer of a restaurant.</p><p>There is a waiter here to greet us.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wethers, Ms. Bennett. My name is Adrien and I will be your server for the evening. Please follow me to your table.\u201d</p><p>Jake takes hold of my hand again, and we follow Adrien into a large dining space.</p><p>I audibly gasp in shock.</p><p>The place is clear. I mean clear. Nothing except for a table for two positioned by the window, and when I say window, I mean the place is wall to wall glass all the way around, so wherever I look all I can see is Paris at night.</p><p>And draped around the whole place are white, twinkly fairly lights, and Jeff Buckley is mid-way through singing \u2018Lilac Wine\u2019 softly in the background.</p><p>I feel like I\u2019ve just stepped into Heaven, and it stops me in my tracks.</p><p>Stopping too, Jake turns to me.</p><p>\u201cYou hired the Eiffel Tower?\u201d I breathe.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have that much pull, Tru \u2013 well I don\u2019t think I do.\u201d He gives me a cheeky smile, pushing his hand through his hair. \u201cI just hired the restaurant for the night \u2013 you know.\u201d He shrugs like this is an everyday thing, downplaying himself like always.</p><p>My heart is bumping clumsily around my chest.</p><p>\u201cJake, this is...\u201d I\u2019m struggling for words. \u201cHow did you manage to pull this off?\u201d I ask, feeling breathless.</p><p>\u201cStuart. He can be pretty persuasive when he wants to be. Especially with my money in his corner.\u201d He rests his hands on my shoulders, running his fingers into my hair. \u201cDo you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, just a bit.\u201d I bite down on my smile.</p><p>\u2018Lilac Wine\u2019 ends, and \u2018Hallelujah\u2019 begins to softly lilt into the air.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to sit down?\u201d Jake tilts his head in the direction of our table, which Adrien is waiting by.</p><p>I shake my head, no. \u201cDance with me.\u201d</p><p>He smiles and it lights his whole face. Jake turns to Adrien. \u201cGive us five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven,\u201d I say, knowing the song hits just about that length of time.</p><p>\u201cSeven,\u201d Jake corrects.</p><p>Adrien nods, and disappears off through the door to his right.</p><p>Jake takes my hand in his, putting his arm around my waist, he pulls me close. I lay my hand against his chest, as he starts to move us, dancing together.</p><p>\u201cYou are so getting laid tonight,\u201d I say, looking into his blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m holding you to that.\u201d There\u2019s this intensity in his gaze which makes me shiver from my head to my toes.</p><p>\u201cDo,\u201d I whisper, as I rest my head against his shoulder.</p><p>I can hear his heart beating up through his chest, his heat caressing me, his special Jake scent soothing me.</p><p>And I know unequivocally this is my happiest moment with him so far, and I just know there\u2019s going to be so many more to come.</p><p>\u201cTe amo,\u201d I murmur quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou too baby, and I will, forever,\u201d he whispers, kissing my hair.</p><p>And we stay here dancing for much longer than our seven minutes, with Jeff Buckley and the lights of Paris as our only other company.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>I let myself in my flat, lugging my heavy suitcase in behind me.</p><p>Simone\u2019s at work. She came home a few days before I did. Her work is a little stricter on holidays than mine; I guess that\u2019s the awesome part of having a boss who is also one of my best friends.</p><p>I just couldn\u2019t bear to leave Jake, and he wasn\u2019t so keen on letting me go either.</p><p>Pulling my phone out of my pocket, I stare down at his last text; the one I received the moment I was settled in my first class seat on the plane to bring me home:</p><p>Just think about it please. I love you so much. I want you in my life, permanently. I want to wake up every day with you beside me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d Jake whispered, holding my face in his hands.</p><p>\u201cI have to. I\u2019ve got work to do at the magazine, and you\u2019ve got promo for the tour to do ... and I\u2019m sure you need to go into the office to check up on the label ... baby, it\u2019s only for a week and then we\u2019ll be back together,\u201d I added, staring up at his sad eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one hundred and sixty eight hours without you,\u201d Jake sighed.</p><p>\u201cDid you just work that out in your head?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cSmarty pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop changing the subject.\u201d</p><p>I hooked my fingers into his T-shirt. \u201cIt\u2019s not a long time and then we\u2019ll be back together.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t mean that. It feels like it\u2019s going to be forever, especially when he just broke it down into hours like that.</p><p>But we\u2019ve been in each other\u2019s pockets far too much recently, and I don\u2019t want Jake to get bored with me. The distance will make him miss me, make him want me more.</p><p>Or get lonely and go looking in search of comfort elsewhere.</p><p>I quickly shut out that thought, and my stupid irrational side.</p><p>The time apart will be good for us.</p><p>Jake stared into my eyes, his blue ones caressing my soul, and I could feel myself faltering, weakening to his plea.</p><p>No. Be strong, Tru. It\u2019s only a week.</p><p>No, it\u2019s one hundred and sixty eight hours...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you, baby,\u201d I said forcing my strength. \u201cSo much, but we both have to work.\u201d I reached up on my tiptoes and kissed his lips.</p><p>\u201cMove in with me.\u201d</p><p>What?!</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I leant back away from his face, resting down onto my unsteady, heeled feet, searching his expression.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spent long enough without you in my life, Tru, and I won\u2019t do it again. Come and live with me in LA. Move in with me.\u201d</p><p>I run my finger over the screen on my phone, staring at his message again.</p><p>\u201cJake, this is crazy! We can\u2019t move in together!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, what\u2019s crazy is that I\u2019m standing in an airport saying goodbye to you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the same as back then. We\u2019re not fourteen anymore. We\u2019re not going to lose each other. I\u2019m yours and you're mine, and that\u2019s never going to change.\u201d I held my friendship bracelet up to him as proof of this. \u201cI\u2019m just going to work for a little while, and then we\u2019ll be back together when I fly out in a week. You\u2019re only asking me to move in with you as a knee jerk, because of how you feel right now about being away from me.\u201d</p><p>He took hold of my arm and kissed my friendship bracelet.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I want to live with you because I\u2019m in love with you. I want to share my life with you. Just tell me you\u2019ll at least think about it?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes briefly. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>His hands moved around my neck, and then he was kissing my deeply.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t regret it,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t said yes, yet.\u201d I lifted my eyebrow at him.</p><p>\u201cNo. But I\u2019m just hoping on the fact you seem to have a hard time saying no to me.\u201d</p><p>Dragging my suitcase through to my bedroom, I dump it down on the floor, then sit on the edge of my bed in the silence for a moment.</p><p>The last time I was here I was here with Will. Everything has changed so much since then.</p><p>I feel a sudden, unexpected tear trickle from my eye. I hurt Will so badly, and I\u2019m never going to be able to take that back or fix it for him.</p><p>It\u2019s hard, feeling happiness to the level I do with Jake, when I know it came at the price of Will\u2019s pain.</p><p>It was easier to block it all out when I was still in Paris with Jake, but sitting here now, surrounded by memories of Will and the time we spent together, just makes it all so real. And it hurts that I hurt him so terribly.</p><p>I loved Will. I still do. Feelings like that don\u2019t just disappear overnight.</p><p>I just wish there was some way to tell him how truly sorry I am.</p><p>Never would I change choosing to be with Jake, I just wish I\u2019d had the foresight to do it the right way.</p><p>But then is there ever an easy way to break the heart of the person you\u2019re in a relationship with, to leave them for your soul mate.</p><p>With a sigh, I start to unpack my suitcase, and set to work on doing my laundry.</p><p>I hate washing clothes, but it helps to keep my mind occupied from sad thoughts of Will, and scary thoughts of moving in with Jake, until Simone gets home from work.</p><p>She\u2019s late getting in as work was busy, but brings pizza home with her, and we sit in the living room eating and drinking wine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Simone tells me all about Denny and what\u2019s been happening with them since she got back home form Paris.</p><p>By the sounds of things, absence is definitely making the heart grow fonder in their case.</p><p>She is totally smitten.

So lasting a week just doesn\u2019t feel like a physical possibility at the moment.

He\u2019s asked me to move to LA to live with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she says. \u201cSo are you going to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to think about.

One quick glance at my phone tells me it\u2019s Jake.</p><p>I haven\u2019t heard from him all day as he\u2019s been on his flight back to LA. He must have just landed.</p><p>\u201cI was gonna go call Denny anyway,\u201d Simone smiles, getting to her feet. \u201cSay hi to Jake for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, baby,\u201d I murmur, answering.</p><p>\u201cCome to LA. Now. Please. I\u2019ll send the jet for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA simple, \u2018I miss you, Tru\u2019, would have done.\u201d I start to chew on my thumbnail.</p><p>\u201cI miss you, Tru. Too much. Now will you please come to LA? I\u2019m going nuts here without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been what \u2013 thirteen hours.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not going to admit to him I\u2019m going nuts without him too.</p><p>\u201cTwelve, and you\u2019re not missing me?\u201d His voice is laced with hurt.</p><p>\u201cI am. Like you\u2019ll never know. Worse than I did when we were kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why are we even doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s healthy to spend time apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just Cosmo bullshit. Tru ... baby, please, I miss you so much, I can\u2019t even begin to explain. I hate that I\u2019m not with you right now,\u201d he sighs. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s it.\u201d He sounds suddenly alert. \u201cI\u2019m cancelling the PR stuff for the tour. If you won\u2019t come to me then I\u2019m coming to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that!\u201d I exclaim. But I love that he wants to.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the boss.

I spent twelve years away from you, Tru. No more. You won\u2019t come to LA then I\u2019m coming to you.\u201d</p><p>I trace my fingertip over a groove in the coffee table. \u201cI never said I wouldn\u2019t come to LA.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence down the line. I can hear his shallow breathing. \u201cYou\u2019ll move in with me?\u201d His voice is soft, tentative.</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, you have no idea how happy you\u2019ve just made me, or how happy I\u2019m going to make you.\u201d I can practically feel his smile down the line.</p><p>\u201cJake, you already make me happy. All I need is you. I have you, I\u2019m the happiest girl in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will you come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me this week to sort things out here, and then I\u2019m all yours for good. I just need to figure work stuff out with Vicky. Figure the flat stuff out with Simone, and tell my folks of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad is going to kick my ass for taking you away from him isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s quite likely,\u201d I laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take his ass-kicking if it means I get you here with me ... so I just have to spend this week away from you, then your mine, for good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I can live with that ... just,\u201d he adds.</p><p>We spend the next few hours on the phone making plans, talking nonsense like Jake and I do, and I love it.</p><p>Eventually I hang up the phone with him, with much reluctance, but I need to sleep as the jetlag finally catches up with me.</p><p>I go to bed, thinking about how I\u2019m going to be quitting my job and moving to LA, and also that I\u2019m going to have to find a job once I\u2019m out there. I\u2019m not sponging off Jake. I\u2019ve got some savings so they should tide me over until I can get sorted with a job. I wonder if Vicky has any magazine contacts out there? Jake will have, but I\u2019m not having his influence getting me a job. I want to do this on my own.</p><p>And I fall asleep thinking of Jake, and all the amazing things we have to look forward to together.</p><p>Life doesn\u2019t get any better than this, as it is right now.</p><p>I wake to the sound of Adele singing. It takes me a minute to grasp my bearings.</p><p>I\u2019m in my flat. In my own bed.</p><p>I squint at the clock \u2013 4am.</p><p>Grabbing my phone off my nightstand, I see it\u2019s Jake.</p><p>\u201cBaby, I miss you too, but it\u2019s 4 am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTru.\u201d</p><p>I instantly know something is wrong by the broken sound in his voice.</p><p>\u201cJake, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d I sit up in bed, concerned, my stomach tying into a thousand knots.</p><p>\u201cTru, it\u2019s\u2013it\u2019s my dad ... he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>My heart stops in my chest.</p><p>\u201cPaul?\u201d I ask, clarifying he doesn\u2019t mean his step-dad Dale.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Jake hasn\u2019t seen his dad since he was nine that I know of. And their history ... well it\u2019s complicated, difficult, and right now I\u2019m unsure which way he\u2019s going to go with this.</p><p>Sadness or relief?</p><p>\u201cBaby, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I say tentatively.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I mean, he\u2019s dead, and I hadn\u2019t seen him since ... so, you know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I breathe. \u201cI\u2019ll come to you now. I\u2019m getting the next flight to LA.\u201d I start to climb up out of bed.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine. I have to come to the UK, for his funeral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was my dad, Tru.\u201d His tone is sharp.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he backtracks. \u201cMy head\u2019s just a little fucked up right now.\u201d He sighs. \u201cI just need you, Tru.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I was with you. I\u2019m so sorry I\u2019m not.\u201d I chastise myself for this whole time apart thing.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you coming to the UK?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve chartered the jet for a midnight flight. I\u2019ll be there early evening your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is the funeral being held?\u201d</p><p>I have no clue where Jake\u2019s dad has been for the last seventeen years.</p><p>\u201cManchester. In two days. I\u2019m arranging it. There\u2019s no one else to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave it to me. You don\u2019t want to be doing it, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I mean Stuart\u2019s helping\u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cI want to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay ... um ... speak to Stuart see what he needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will ... so should I meet you in Manchester?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m coming to London first. I need to see you ... and the funeral's not \u2018til Friday ... is it okay if I stay with you at your place? I just\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake, you don\u2019t even have to ask, I want you here. And the funeral, do you want me to come with you?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to presume he\u2019ll want me there. I don\u2019t want to presume anything at the moment.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m there. It\u2019s you and me now, Jake. And what about your mum? Is she coming to the funeral?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His tone is curt.</p><p>It\u2019s understandable why Susie wouldn\u2019t want to go, but I thought she would to support Jake.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, unsure what to say right now.</p><p>There\u2019s a pause between us before Jake speaks again.</p><p>\u201cI need you, Tru.\u201d I can hear his ragged breathing down the line.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m always here for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s late there, but will you stay on the phone with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I will. So what do you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me. Our future. What we\u2019re going to do together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you want me to talk about that house we\u2019re going to build on an island in the Maldives that belongs just to us, and we\u2019re going to live off the land like a pair of castaways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Trudy Bennett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you, Jake Wethers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me more about this island?\u201d</p><p>And I do. I stay on the phone with Jake until the sun rises, and it\u2019s time for him to catch his flight to London.</p><p>I shower, dress, force a little bit of breakfast down, and then head into work taking the Tube.</p><p>I\u2019m tired. I\u2019ve had little sleep, but I couldn\u2019t sleep at the moment if I tried, I\u2019m too worried about Jake.</p><p>Vicky beams brightly at me when I knock on her open door, then I watch as her face drops when she sees mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, my darling?\u201d she asks worried, getting out of her chair, coming over to me.</p><p>\u201cJake\u2019s dad died.\u201d My voice wobbles and I know I\u2019m set to cry any minute now.</p><p>I\u2019m not upset about Paul dying \u2013 not at all. I\u2019m upset because Jake is.</p><p>I can feel his pain like it\u2019s my own even though there\u2019s an ocean between us.</p><p>He hurts. I hurt.</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetness.\u201d She puts her hands on my arms, looking searching into my face. \u201cHow is Jake doing?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cHe hadn\u2019t seen his dad in a long time. They had a ... difficult relationship ... but honestly, I think it\u2019s hit him pretty hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome, let\u2019s sit.\u201d She guides me over to the little sofa in her office.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry to do this to you again, Vicky ... but I need to take some time off to be with Jake. He\u2019s flying in today, and the funeral is in Manchester on Friday. Of course I\u2019ll work from home, and I\u2019ll catch up on whatever I miss before I go to the US for the rest of the tour.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Tru.\u201d She takes my hand patting it with her other. \u201cEverything is in hand here with your column. The important thing at the moment is Jake, and making sure he\u2019s okay. We can worry about the bio and everything else later.\u201d</p><p>I feel the weight lift off my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cHave I told you lately how wonderful you are?\u201d I can feel tears forming in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d She winks at me.</p> <p>\u201cWell you are, and I love you lots and lots.\u201d I wrap my arms around her, hugging her.</p><p>Then the tears start to run from my eyes.</p><p>How am I going to cope without her and Simone when I move to LA? And my Mum and Dad for that matter?</p><p>I can\u2019t even tell Vicky about the move at the moment. I will soon, but dropping this on her is enough for now, I think.</p><p>\u201cOh, my darling girl, don\u2019t cry,\u201d she says hearing my sniffling, she hugs me tighter.</p> <p>Thank god I wore waterproof mascara today. Subconsciously, I must have known I would be crying a lot today.</p><p>Releasing myself, I get a tissue from my bag, and dry my eyes.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. You\u2019ve had an emotional time of late, a lot of changes in your life. I\u2019d be worried if you weren\u2019t crying. Now, do you want something to drink?\u201d she asks, getting to her feet, moving toward her desk.</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking something a little stronger.\u201d Her tone is conspiratorial. Then she pulls a bottle of Jim Beam from out of her desk drawer.</p> <p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d I say, a little smile forming on my lips, as Vicky grabs two cups off her shelf.</p><p>I leave work a little over an hour later, having spent that time in Vicky\u2019s office talking and drinking whiskey.</p><p>I feel a little lighter after the chat, and a lot lighter after the whiskey, and now I\u2019m more than ready to see Jake.</p><p>Eight hours to go.</p><p>As I push out of the glass doors of my building, the cool air hits my skin, and the lightness, kindly provided by Jim Beam, unfortunately, starts to lift.</p><p>Taking a right, I turn to head toward the Tube station for home.</p><p>\u201cTru?\u201d</p><p>Pausing, I turn around to see Will standing about twenty yards away from me.</p> <p>He\u2019s dressed in blue jeans, a plain white T-shirt, and a black leather jacket. He looks like he hasn\u2019t shaved in a while, and I can see the bruising left from his fight with Jake around his eye. I hate that they fought because of me.</p><p>He looks different, but still handsome. Just Will. The Will I loved \u2013 love.</p><p>I feel a sudden pang for him. The intensity of it surprises me.</p><p>\u201cWill? What-what are you doing here?\u201d I try to recover myself from the shock of just seeing him here in the street.</p><p>\u201cSorry I just\u2013\u201d he takes a step forward.</p><p>\u201cHave you followed me?\u201d I ask.</p><p>That sounded really conceited. I wish I could take it back.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answers softly. \u201cI\u2019d just popped into work to drop something off, and I saw you go into your building. I just ... I wanted to talk to you, so I hung around and waited.\u201d He pushes his hands deep in his pockets. \u201cI called you ... left messages but you never called me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I hug my bag to my side. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think it was a good idea to talk then, you were angry ... rightly so and I didn\u2019t want to make things worse for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d He takes another step closer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d I tuck my hair nervously behind my ear. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know.\u201d He shrugs, and runs his hand through his lovely blonde hair. It looks all mussed up. Very un-Will. It suits him.</p><p>His eyes meet with mine.</p><p>He looks nervous and sad. My heart is aching seeing him here standing before me looking this way.</p><p>This is what I\u2019ve done to him.</p><p>\u201cDo you have time to have a coffee?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean if you too busy, I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not too busy. Of course I\u2019ll have coffee with you.\u201d I smile.</p><p>He smiles too. It\u2019s nice to see. I\u2019ve missed his lovely smile.</p><p>I\u2019ve missed him. I just didn\u2019t realise how much until now.</p><p>\u201cShall we go to Callo\u2019s?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYes, lets.\u201d</p><p>We walk side by side in relative silence for the five minute walk to Callo\u2019s.</p><p>When we arrive, Will holds the door open for me. I walk into the caf\u00e9, the aroma of coffee hitting me straight away, and memories, so many memories.</p><p>This was our place. We always had lunch together here.</p><p>It\u2019s sad being here with him now, like this, apart. I guess I never thought there would be a day that I would ever be without Will.</p><p>As it\u2019s early Callo\u2019s is empty, only Will and I here, so we get a small table by the window and order two lattes.</p><p>\u201cAre you not in work today?\u201d I ask, at a vain attempt in small talk, while we wait for our drinks.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he shakes his head. \u201cI took a little time off after I got back from Paris \u2013 you know.\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip. I can feel tears forming in my eyes, but I don\u2019t want to cry in front of him. I don\u2019t deserve the right to cry.</p><p>I knot my fingers on the table in front of me. Taking a deep breath, I say, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Will. For everything. For the pain I\u2019ve caused you\u201d</p><p>He meets my eyes, and all I can see in them is hurt. And I can\u2019t help the tear that escapes from my eye.</p><p>I quickly catch it falling.</p><p>\u201cTru, that day ... when I pushed you away in the hall and you fell ... I didn\u2019t hurt you did I?\u201d He sounds tormented.</p><p>After everything I have done to him, and he still cares whether he hurt me or not.</p><p>It makes my heart hurt more.</p><p>Another tear drops. \u201cNo, of course you didn\u2019t,\u201d I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cI saw the papers,\u201d he utters quietly. \u201cYou ... and Jake.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes briefly.</p><p>\u201cAre you happy?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYes ... and no. I\u2019m not happy for what I\u2019ve done to you. I\u2019m so sorry, Will.\u201d Tears are running freely from my eyes now, and I don\u2019t care who sees.</p><p>I can see Will\u2019s eyes shining, but he\u2019s holding himself together.</p><p>\u201cI hate myself for what I did to you.\u201d I wipe the dripping tears from my chin with the back of my hand.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you, Tru. I wanted to, but I can\u2019t ... I love you too much.\u201d</p><p>I bite my trembling lip.</p><p>I never deserved this wonderful man here, before me, in the first place. And I most certainly don\u2019t deserve him now.</p><p>He takes a deep breath. \u201cIf I said to you that none of it mattered, what happened with Jake \u2013 that I still want you irrespective of it all.\u201d He pauses, pressing his lips together, before finishing. \u201cWould you ... come back to me?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so torn in this moment. Being away from Will, it was easy to forget how much I loved him ... still love him.</p><p>A part of me wants to say yes, a big part, to take his and my pain away.</p><p>But I can\u2019t.</p><p>Jake is my soul mate. My best friend. And I would always go back to him, every time.</p><p>I slowly shake my head. \u201cI love you, Will. Very much. But ... I love Jake more. He\u2019s my best friend. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>A tear runs from his eye, which he quickly brushes away. \u201cI just don\u2019t know how to live my life without you in it, Tru. Nothing\u2019s making sense right now.\u201d</p><p>I want to touch him. Hold him. I want to fix this, but I don\u2019t know how to.</p><p>\u201cYou deserve better than me.\u201d I blink out more tears. \u201cYou always did. You were always too good for me, Will. You deserve someone who would never, ever hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want you,\u201d he says. A tear runs down his cheek. He doesn\u2019t wipe this one away.</p><p>My lip wobbles again, tears streaming. \u201cAnd a part of me wants you too, but I belong to Jake. I always have done. I love you very much and I always will, but ... I love Jake more.\u201d I rub my runny nose on my sleeve.</p><p>At that, the waiter comes over with our lattes. I grab some napkins, quickly drying my tears.</p><p>The waiter has the good grace to pretend he doesn\u2019t see me crying.</p><p>Once he departs, Will reaches across the table and takes hold of my hand, squeezing it.</p><p>I start crying again.</p><p>And we sit here like this for a long while, not talking, leaving our lattes to go cold, holding hands, watching the world pass by through the window, just having this time together.</p><p>I know this is the last time I\u2019ll see Will, and for now, I just want to hold on to him for as long as I can.</p><p>After what seems like forever in only a short time, I reluctantly realise we can\u2019t sit here all day together. Will does too.</p><p>He pays for our drinks refusing my offer to pay.</p><p>We stand just outside of Callo\u2019s, lingering. I don\u2019t know how to say goodbye to him.</p><p>I\u2019m so confused. I don\u2019t want to let him go. But I know I have to.</p><p>I thought that telling Will about Jake and I was the hardest thing I\u2019d ever had to do, but it\u2019s not. This here, letting him go, is the hardest thing I will ever do.</p><p>\u201cAre you taking the Tube home?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to walk you to the station?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, no. \u201cThank you, but I think I should go alone.\u201d</p><p>We need to say goodbye outside of here. Our place.</p><p>Will looks up at the sign for Callo\u2019s. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to come here again,\u201d he sighs.</p><p>\u201cMe either.\u201d</p><p>He looks back and meets my eyes. And I can\u2019t help but cry again.</p><p>I bite my lip trying to force the tears away, but looking at him here, knowing this is the last time I\u2019m ever going to see him, it\u2019s breaking my heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d My lip quivers.</p><p>Without another thought, Will wraps his arms around me, enveloping me in a tight hug.</p><p>He smells of everything Will. Of warmth, comfort, and safety. Of the last two years of my life. I breathe him in, trying to hold onto it \u2013 him for as long as I can.</p><p>I know I\u2019m the one doing this, but knowing that doesn\u2019t make it any easier.</p><p>I never knew it was possible to love two men at the same time.</p><p>But I do. I love Will and Jake.</p><p>I just love Jake more, and that means I have to let Will go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always love you, Tru,\u201d he whispers into my hair. I hear his voice break. \u201cJake will never be good enough for you. You deserve so much more than he can ever give.\u201d</p><p>Then he releases me, and strides away, shoving his hands deep into his pockets as he walks, and I stand here outside Callo\u2019s watching him go.</p><p>Watching the biggest part of the last two years of my life, walking away from me, at my behest.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>I\u2019m really worried about Jake. He\u2019s been so distant, so closed off these last few days in the lead up to his dad\u2019s funeral.</p><p>It\u2019s affected him so much more than I ever anticipated it would.</p><p>I guess, I just thought because he hadn\u2019t seen his dad in so long, and what happened the last time he did see him, well ... not that I thought he would be happy he\u2019s dead, I suppose I just didn\u2019t realise it would hit him so hard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s like he\u2019s here, but he\u2019s not. And I\u2019m worried that he\u2019s slipped back into a time he\u2019s tried so hard to forget.</p><p>It\u2019s a hot August day here in Manchester, and I\u2019m thankful for the sleeveless black linen dress I\u2019m wearing and for the air-con in the BMW X5 which Dave is driving, taking us to Paul\u2019s funeral. Stuart\u2019s in the front next to him, and I\u2019m in the back with Jake, who\u2019s been staring out of the window since we left the hotel to make the journey to the crematorium. He\u2019s wearing a black Armani suit, crisp white shirt and black tie, and dress shoes. It\u2019s strange to see Jake in a suit, and even though he\u2019s look absolutely amazing, breath-taking, I want him out of these clothes and back in his Jake threads. I want my Jake back.</p><p>I just hope the surprise, if you can call it that on a day like today, will help lift his spirit and bring him back to me.</p><p>I called Susie, Jake\u2019s mum. I got her number from Jake\u2019s phone when he was in the shower yesterday morning.</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t going to come to the funeral. Understandable of course after what Paul did to her and Jake. But she needs to, for Jake\u2019s sake.</p><p>I\u2019m doing everything I can for him, but for this, I think she\u2019s the only person who can help him.</p><p>They lived it together, now they need to lay it to rest together.</p><p>It was weird speaking to her after all these years.</p><p>Once we got past the initial awkwardness, it was actually really nice to talk to Susie again. She told me that she\u2019s really happy Jake and I have found each other again, and more so that we\u2019re together. She said she always knew we were meant for one other.</p> <p>I actually felt really teary hearing that.</p><p>Then I told her my reason for calling.</p><p>She took the first flight out of New York to Manchester. Stuart booked her into our hotel, but her flight was landing at lunchtime, so she\u2019s coming straight to the funeral from the airport. Dale couldn\u2019t come with her as he\u2019s currently in China on business.</p><p>Susie and I are keeping our phone conversation between us.</p><p>That was my decision.</p><p>I don\u2019t want Jake to know I called her. I want him to think she turned up because she wanted to be here for him.</p> <p>Not that she didn\u2019t want to help her son. Of course she does. She was just blinded by her own anger for Paul, understandably, and she just needed a nudge in the right direction.</p><p>Dave pulls the car down the long road to the crematorium. I feel Jake\u2019s hand tighten around mine.</p><p>I lean close to him, and rest my cheek against his. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d I whisper in his ear.</p><p>He moves back from me, staring into my eyes. He looks so different, so little boy lost. It makes me ache for him.</p><p>I\u2019m praying that Susie is already here waiting for us.</p><p>Jake lifts his hand to my face, tucking my hair behind my ear, he kisses me gently on the lips and murmurs, \u201cYou\u2019re everything to me, Tru. You know that right?\u201d</p><p>I nod, confused as to where he\u2019s going with this.</p><p>He takes my chin between his thumb and forefinger. \u201cJust ... don\u2019t ever leave me. No matter what \u2013 just don\u2019t ever leave.\u201d</p> <p>I swallow down. He\u2019s worrying me with these words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. I\u2019m yours, Jake. You have my heart. I belong to you.\u201d</p><p>Nervous and unsure, I lean in and kiss him lightly on the lips. But he grabs hold of my hair, kissing me harder, desperately, his tongue invading my mouth, claiming me. And it reminds me of the time he kissed me in bed when we were still having an affair. The first time he talked to me about Jonny. The desperation and intensity I felt then, I feel now, and more.</p><p>It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s trying to tell me something with this kiss. Something he can\u2019t say with words.</p><p>When Dave pulls the car up outside the building, Jake\u2019s already released me from his hold, and I see Susie is here, waiting with my mum and dad outside the building. I almost sigh with relief.</p><p>As Jake registers her, I see it on his face, the surprise, the relief; I don\u2019t miss that, it almost breaks me.</p><p>Susie comes over to the car as Jake climbs out, me behind him.</p><p>She looks so different to how I remember her. I guess that\u2019s what happiness and a lot of money can do for you.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d He sounds confused, angry ... happy.</p><p>Susie looks up at him, shading her eyes from the sun with her hand. \u201cI thought you might need me,\u201d she says quietly. Reaching out, she takes hold of his hand.</p><p>I slip quietly away, leaving them both, and go over to my mum and dad.</p><p>\u201cHey, daddy.\u201d I smile up at him, as he puts his arm around me, kissing the top of my hair. \u201cHey, mama,\u201d I say, leaning forward to kiss her. \u201cThank you so much for coming, I know it will mean the world to Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only reason we are here is for you and Jake, baby girl,\u201d my dad says to me.</p><p>I squeeze him tighter, hugging him. I\u2019m so lucky to have a dad as wonderful as mine is.</p><p>Jake comes over to us with Susie a few moments later. She looks like she\u2019s been crying, her eyes are a little bloodshot.</p><p>\u201cHello, Trudy,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s so wonderful to see you again.\u201d She puts her arm out for me, and I step out of my dad\u2019s embrace and into hers.</p><p>She kisses my cheek and whispers, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I give her an understanding smile as she releases me. Then she takes hold of Jake\u2019s hand, and they start to walk into the crematorium together. I follow behind with my mum and dad.</p><p>Then Jake stops, pausing, he turns and waits for me, holding his free hand out for me to take.</p><p>I slip my hand into his, and we all go into the service together.</p><p>After the funeral we all have an early dinner together at our hotel \u2013 Jake, me, Susie, my mum and dad, Stuart and Dave.</p><p>Jake seems a little more relaxed at dinner. He\u2019s currently talking guitars with my dad, and he looks happier than I\u2019ve seen him in days.</p><p>The funeral was difficult and over quickly, thankfully. We were the only ones there. Paul had no one. No family left except for Jake. No real friends. No one who really cared about him.</p><p>I know I should feel sad at the thought, but I don\u2019t. I hate him for what he did to Jake. And I never thought I would be happy that someone was dead, but I am, because now, maybe Jake can finally let him go for good. Let his past go once and for all.</p><p>There was no wake after the funeral, and this dinner most certainly isn\u2019t one.</p><p>This dinner is for Jake to help lift his spirits. I\u2019ve also got a little something planned for later which I\u2019m hoping will put a smile back on his face, one that I hope will stay there for a long time to come.</p><p>Not long after dinner is finished, Susie, tired from her flight, tells us she\u2019s going to retire early, which works perfectly for my plans for Jake.</p><p>My mum and dad decide to go home too, and Stuart goes for a drink in the hotel bar with Dave.</p><p>\u201cYou want to join Stuart and Dave for a drink? Or just have an early night?\u201d Jake asks, threading his fingers with mine, pulling me to his side as we walk back through the lobby, after seeing my mum and dad out of the hotel.</p><p>\u201cNeither. We\u2019re doing something else tonight,\u201d I say.</p><p>Stopping, I turn to face him.</p><p>\u201cWe are?\u201d His hands go to my hips, his head tilting to the side, assessing my face.</p><p>\u201cAhum,\u201d I nod, smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, my gorgeous boyfriend, is a surprise.\u201d I take hold of his hand, leaving him wondering, and lead him to the lifts to take us to the car park, and to the waiting car which contains everything I need for tonight.</p><p>As it\u2019s my surprise, and Jake has no idea where we\u2019re going, I\u2019m driving ... and tonight I\u2019m driving James Bonds car.</p><p>Aston Martin\u2019s are Jake\u2019s favourite car, hence the hire for our stay. And I\u2019m so totally flooring it on the motorway.</p><p>I honestly didn\u2019t know it was possible to feel sexy driving a car. But I do right now. I feel like I\u2019m a model in an advert or something.</p><p>It\u2019s so cool. And I keep wanting to let out little squeals of excitement, but of course I won\u2019t, because that would be weird, and also a little inappropriate considering Jake just buried his dad a few hours ago, or cremated him or whatever.</p><p>\u201cSo you won\u2019t tell me where we\u2019re going?\u201d Jake asks, as I push the car up to eighty-five.</p><p>I don\u2019t get to drive very often, and I have never driven a car as amazing as this one, so I\u2019m totally making the most of it.</p><p>\u201cNope, it\u2019s a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like surprises?\u201d</p><p>Keeping my eyes on the dark road ahead, I say, \u201cI don\u2019t like receiving them. I never said anything about giving them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d he laughs.</p><p>There\u2019s only so long I can keep it a surprise before he guesses where it is we\u2019re going, as he keeps looking at the bloody road signs. I should have had the foresight to bring a blind fold with me.</p><p>Jake, in a blindfold, totally at my mercy. Hmm, I\u2019m liking the sound of that. Maybe later.</p><p>As I see the sign post signalling my turn to the place we\u2019re going, I slide a glance at him, seeing the look on his face, and he looks happy.</p><p>He turns to me, smiling widely. \u201cYou\u2019re taking me to Lumb Falls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d I give him another quick glance, a little smile of my own forming.</p><p>Jake reaches his hand over and puts it on my thigh. \u201cAre you going to let me do dirty things to you while we\u2019re there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was planning on doing dirty things to you, actually.\u201d I bite down on my lip, giving him another quick glance.</p><p>\u201cHave I told you just how much I love you?\u201d He slides his hand a little higher up my thigh, fingers inching my dress up.</p><p>Heat pools in my tummy.</p><p>\u201cYou have.\u201d I swat his hand away, grinning. \u201cBut behave yourself pervy, or you\u2019ll get no dirty tonight at all. I\u2019m trying to drive James Bonds car here if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d I put my best prim and proper teasing voice on.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he says, resting his hands back on his lap, grinning back at me.</p><p>He looks so free in this moment, and it makes my heart swell.</p><p>Tonight is going to be so much fun, I just know it. I knew bringing him here was the right thing to do.</p><p>I park the car up near the Falls. Climbing out, I go straight to the boot, and open it up.</p><p>I get the picnic box and cooler out which Stuart helped me get ready earlier on.</p><p>I hand the cooler to Jake, as he meets me around the back of the car.</p><p>Keeping hold of the picnic box, I grab the blanket, shut the boot and lock the car up.</p><p>Jake follows behind me, taking the picnic box from my hand, leaving me with just my bag and the blanket to carry as I navigate our way to the shore of the Falls in the darkness.</p><p>When we reach our destination, I set the blanket down and retrieve the lantern that I packed into the picnic box.</p><p>\u201cCan I borrow your lighter, baby?\u201d</p><p>Jake crouches beside me, handing me his lighter.</p><p>I light the candle in the lantern and set it down beside the blanket, then hand his lighter back to him.</p><p>Taking it from me, Jake pulls me to him and starts to kiss me.</p><p>He eases me back onto the blanket, his tongue roaming my mouth, meeting with mine, stroking it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Being back here with him, kissing me in the dark like this, with only the sound of the rushing falls around us, feels amazing.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d I push my fingers into his lovely thick hair.</p><p>\u201cFor this, bringing me here ... for being you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou like?\u201d I check.</p><p>\u201cI love. We should come back here once a year. Make it our thing. It is our place after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce a year it is.\u201d</p><p>He takes my face in his hands. \u201cJust like this, Tru, late at night, just you and me, alone. No one around for miles.\u201d</p><p>I nod my agreement. Jake kisses me once more, lightly on the lips, then moves off me, and lies down beside me, flat on his back.</p> <p>Feeling content, I stare up at the night sky, with its gentle smattering of stars and bright glowing moon.</p><p>Jake lets out a light sigh.</p><p>Instantly, I know his mind and mood have shifted elsewhere, and I think I know where to.</p><p>Maybe bringing him here to Lumb Falls hasn\u2019t been as effective as I had hoped.</p><p>I can almost feel his thoughts pouring out of his mind. I want to ask him what\u2019s wrong, but I know with Jake it\u2019s best to wait until he\u2019s ready to talk.</p><p>\u201cYou called my mom and asked her to come didn\u2019t you?\u201d He turns his head to the side, looking at me.</p> <p>Truth or denial.</p><p>Denial.</p><p>I want him to believe she came off her own back.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I shake my head, blinking.</p><p>\u201cTru...\u201d He gives me the \u2018I know you did\u2019 look.</p><p>Biting my bottom lip, I release my sigh out through my nose. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d I concede. \u201cDid your mum tell you?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, no. \u201cI just know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you angry with me?\u201d I screw my face up.</p> <p>\u201cNo of course not.\u201d He looks surprised.</p><p>\u201cAre you angry with your mum?\u201d</p><p>He presses his lips together and shakes his head.</p><p>No, he\u2019s not angry, he\u2019s disappointed, and that\u2019s worse. Way worse.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t realise how much it was affecting you, Jake. The instant I told her, she came off the phone and booked the next available flight to Manchester.\u201d</p><p>Turning away from me, he looks up and the sky. I hear him exhale.</p><p>\u201cHe tried to rape her that night.\u201d His voice is so quiet in the night air.</p><p>I turn on my side, facing him. \u201cYour dad?\u201d</p><p>He nods.</p><p>\u201cHe was drunk and high, he\u2019d been out gambling, fuckin\u2019 around like normal ... he\u2019d been gone for weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d I breathe.</p><p>\u201cI liked it when he wasn\u2019t there. I always liked it best when he was off on one of his benders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I put my hand on his chest over his heart.</p><p>\u201cAnd that night he rolled home, broke, wanting money off mom like usual. It was late, but I was still awake. We\u2019d been watching a movie together \u2013 I can\u2019t even remember which one now, but she sent me to my room the second she heard his key go in the lock. She told me to lock myself in my bedroom and to not come out no matter what. I mean \u2013 what kid has to have a lock on their bedroom door, you know?\u201d He laughs, but there\u2019s no humour there.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave her with him, but I did as I was told. I could hear them fighting downstairs. He wanted money and she didn\u2019t have any to give him. Then he started beating her, like he\u2019d done so many times before, and I could hear it and I just wanted it to stop, Tru. And I just knew this time was worse \u2013 I don\u2019t know how, I just knew.\u201d He drags his hands through his hair.</p><p>\u201cThen I heard mom running up the stairs, trying to get away from him. He was yelling, and I could hear her screaming out on the landing, and I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore \u2013 I just wanted to help her, I wanted him to stop hurting her. So I came out of my bedroom, and he had her there on the floor, and ... she was covered in blood \u2013 her face was a mess, I barely recognised her and\u2013\u201d He pauses.</p><p>My heart is aching as I look at him, seeing him reliving that moment in his mind.</p><p>He turns his head and meets my eyes. \u201cI saw the fear in her eyes, Tru. I\u2019ll never forget that look \u2013 she was terrified for me and for her. Horrified that I\u2019d seen it \u2013 seen what he was trying to do to her. I was only nine, but I knew enough to understand what was happening. Then I just started yelling at him to stop. I tried to grab him and pull him off her. But I was nine, and he was stronger than me. He just grabbed hold of me and tossed me aside like I was a fuckin\u2019 toy \u2013 a fuckin\u2019 inconvenience. We were near the top of the stairs, and I went down the full flight.\u201d</p><p>I briefly close my eyes, and feel a tear run down the side of my face, soaking into my hair.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember much after that. I just remember hearing my mom screaming for help. Then the next thing I knew your dad was beside me, and I could hear the sirens coming, and your dad just kept saying, over and over, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry, Jake. I\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t stop this from happening to you.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Tears are streaming down my face now.</p><p>\u201cAfterwards at the hospital they told me I had hit my head hard from the fall. I had a concussion, had broken my arm and my jaw, and had cut my chin open, and I\u2019d had to have stitches.\u201d His hand goes to his chin, touching his scar.</p><p>He looks so young in this moment, and I wish I knew how to fix things for him. To somehow take his pain away forever.</p><p>Jake puts his palms to his eyes for a moment. I know he\u2019s pushing back whatever emotion is in there.</p><p>I wipe my face dry with my hands.</p><p>That\u2019s the first time Jake has ever spoken to me properly about what happened that night. I knew bits and pieces, but I didn\u2019t know Paul had tried to rape Susie. That part was kept from me by my folks for obvious reasons.</p><p>Paul went to prison for what he did to Jake and Susie. Eight years he got. Eight measly years. I know, ridiculous huh? Throw your kid down a flight of stairs and nearly kill him, beat and almost rape your wife, and here you go, we\u2019ll give you eight years in HMS\u2019s finest with the chance of early parole.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Paul die of?\u201d I ask quietly.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t plucked up the courage to ask Jake what Paul died of in these last few days. He\u2019s been so closed off and I didn\u2019t want to push things for him.</p><p>Whatever it was he did die of, I hope he somehow suffered after what he did to Jake and Susie.</p><p>\u201cA heart-attack,\u201d Jake answers quietly. \u201cHe\u2019d been dead for five days before anyone found him. It was a neighbour who alerted the police when they hadn\u2019t seen him for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad you heard anything from him over the years?\u201d</p><p>Sighing, he takes my hand in his and brings it to his mouth, kissing my knuckles.</p><p>\u201cAfter he went to jail, he was clean for a while, and he was writing me asking me to forgive him, but I never replied. Then we moved to the States with Dale, and I didn\u2019t hear anything until I was twenty-two and the band was flying high. He got in touch with me through Stuart. I don\u2019t how he got hold of his number but he did. It took me a week before I called him back. I had all these things ready that I was going to say to him. I was going to tear him a shred \u2013 and you know what?\u201d he snorts. \u201cThe second I heard his voice, I felt like that nine year old kid again. I felt so fuckin\u2019 weak in that moment, and I fuckin\u2019 blew it.\u201d</p><p>I rest up on my elbow. Looking down into his eyes, I brush his hair off his forehead. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make you weak, baby, it makes you human.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI was weak, Tru. I didn\u2019t say a goddamn thing to him about what he\u2019d done to me and mom. And the worst thing was, he hadn\u2019t got in touch because he wanted to apologise for what he\u2019d done, or to even see me \u2013 he called because he needed money.\u201d</p><p>In this moment, I hate Paul. I can feel the anger bubbling under my skin.</p><p>\u201cDid you give him it?\u201d I ask, chewing on the inside of my mouth.</p><p>I already know the answer, because I know Jake.</p><p>He sighs. \u201cMy lawyer sent him a non-disclosure saying that he could never talk about me or my past and what had happened. That he could never make claim to be my dad in the press, or to anyone ever. If he signed he could have the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he sign?\u201d</p><p>He looks at me. \u201cThere was a two hundred thousand dollar check sitting at the bottom of it, so yeah, he signed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave him two hundred thousand dollars?\u201d I gasp.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to me, Tru. And if it meant keeping him and that part of my life away from me, then it was more than worth it. I knew the money wouldn\u2019t last him long though. He always could burn through money quick. He liked drugs ... just like I do. I guess it\u2019s true what they say \u2013 the apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree.\u201d He rolls his eyes in on himself.</p><p>I grab his face, turning him to look me. \u201cYou are nothing like him, Jake \u2013 nothing. And you never could be.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t look so sure.</p><p>\u201cI am, Tru. I know you won\u2019t want to see it \u2013 I know you want to see the good in me, and I love you for that, more than you could ever know ... but I am like him \u2013 a lot like him. I would never hurt you \u2013 I could never hurt you.\u201d He touches my face. \u201cBut the drugs and the booze ... and the women,\u201d he sighs. \u201cI\u2019m exactly like him. My mom knows it too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said that?\u201d I gasp.</p><p>He shakes his head, no. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to. I can see it in her eyes every time she looks at me \u2013 the disappointment, just how much I remind her of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe that. Susie loves you. Yes, you\u2019ve struggled in your past, understandably so because of what he did to you. But you\u2019re not that person anymore, you took control and you\u2019re stronger now.\u201d</p><p>His gaze softens on me. He brushes his knuckles across my cheekbone. \u201cBecause I have you back in my life.\u201d</p><p>I take hold of his hand, kissing it.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever hear from him again?\u201d I ask, lying back down beside him, keeping hold of his hand.</p><p>\u201cJust before Jonny died. He\u2019d gone through the money, like I knew he would. So I sent him four hundred grand. Thought it might keep him away for double the length of time. Then the next time I hear anything it\u2019s from the authorities. I was listed as his next of kin. He had no one else. So it was left to me to bury him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s gone now, so we can leave all of that in the past where it belongs, and move forward \u2013 start our life together properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn LA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn LA,\u201d I smile. \u201cDo you want a beer?\u201d I ask, sitting up, letting go of his hand.</p><p>\u201cThought you\u2019d never ask,\u201d he jibes, and I feel a little of my Jake returning to me.</p><p>I grab a couple of beers out of the cooler, pop the caps off and hand him his, as he sits up facing me.</p><p>\u201cTo Lumb Falls, hot summers, and missing bikini tops,\u201d I grin lifting my bottle and chink it against his.</p><p>\u201cAnd more missing bikini tops to come,\u201d he grins back at me, naughty Jake in his eyes, before taking a swig of his beer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Resting his bottle against his thigh, he looks back over his shoulder, out at the darkened water of the falls for a long moment.</p><p>I wonder what\u2019s on his mind?</p><p>I\u2019m just about to ask when he speaks. \u201cI almost died last year because of the drugs.\u201d His face is still turned away from me.</p><p>My heart freezes solid in my chest. I guess tonight is the night for confessions from him.</p> <p>\u201cI drowned, and Stuart saved me,\u201d he adds.</p><p>\u201cWhat? When? How?\u201d I\u2019m up on my knees now, putting my bottle down.</p><p>Jake turns and looks at me. His gaze is dark and torn. It\u2019s painful to see.</p><p>\u201cIt was after Japan. I know everyone thinks I went into rehab because of what happened there, but it wasn\u2019t. When I got back to LA, I was worse than ever ... I was using \u2013 a lot. A few nights after I was back, I was out partying and was, absolutely high off my ass. Dave took me home. He had to carry me out of the club and to the car I was in that much of a state. He wanted to stay with me, but I told him I wanted to be alone \u2013 well basically I told him to fuck off. I shouted him out of the house. I treated him like a piece of shit that night, and he didn\u2019t deserve it. I\u2019m lucky he stayed working for me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m glad he did to, because I think Jake would struggle without him, but I don\u2019t say that.</p> <p>\u201cStuart was out, I was alone. I passed out for a while on the sofa. When I woke the drugs had worn off, so I took another hit of coke, and sat out by the pool drinking tequila. Then in my blind wisdom, I decided to get in the pool,\u201d he sighs. \u201cThe next thing I know, I\u2019m puking up water, and Stuart is over me, holding me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe saved my life that day, Tru. I owe him everything. He called 911, kept it out of the papers.\u201d He takes a drink of his beer. \u201cStuart went absolutely fuckin\u2019 nuts on me at the hospital afterwards though. I\u2019d never seen him like that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s understandable, baby,\u201d I say softly, desperately trying to hold myself together. \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t of got there in time ... then...\u201d I can\u2019t even say the words. I can\u2019t even bear to think how close he came, it\u2019s scaring the hell out of me.</p><p>I gulp back my threatening tears. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when you went to rehab?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He nods. \u201cStuart threatened to quit unless I sorted myself out. Said he\u2019d watched me destroying myself for far too long ... that losing Jonny had been hard on all of us, and he wasn\u2019t going to stay around to watch me die too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s the best in the business, that\u2019s why he works for me and I couldn\u2019t afford to lose him,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cSo I agreed to go to rehab.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s downplaying it. He loves Stuart like a brother, and he knew he was right about rehab.</p><p>\u201cNo one knows what happened that night, Tru. Not my mom or Tom, not even Denny. There\u2019s only you, Stuart, and the doctors at the hospital who know.\u201d</p><p>In this moment I despise Paul. More than I ever knew it possible to hate a dead person.</p><p>Jake struggles like he does, because of him.</p><p>\u201cYou can always trust me with anything, baby.\u201d I touch his face. \u201cI\u2019ll never judge you and I\u2019ll never break your trust, I promise you that. Just please ... don\u2019t ever go back there again. Promise me that you\u2019ll never take drugs again.\u201d</p><p>He kisses the friendship bracelet on my wrist. \u201cI promise you ... so that missing bikini top,\u201d he says, gently pushing me down to the blanket, lying on top of me, he holds my hands above my head.</p><p>It\u2019s an obvious attempt at a subject change, and I allow it. Jake sometimes needs sex as a way to rid his mind of his demons. And if that\u2019s what he needs right now, then I\u2019m more than happy to oblige.</p> <p>\u201cMmm?\u201d I reply, smiling.</p><p>\u201cWell, if I remember right, I\u2019m owed a re-enactment and a few other things too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it just so happens, Pervy Perverson, I have a bikini with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why I love you Mrs. P, \u2018cause you\u2019re just as pervy as I am,\u201d he grins. \u201cNow get your hot ass into that bikini, so I can slowly take it back off you.\u201d</p><p>He climbs up off me, taking my hands, he pulls me to my feet.</p><p>Moving away from him, with butterflies doing diving swoops in my tummy, I go to get my bikini out of my bag.</p><p>As I turn back around, I find a very naked Jake, standing here before me.</p><p>\u201cWow, that was quick,\u201d I giggle, eyes roaming his hot body.</p><p>\u201cWell, when we\u2019re talking sex and you, baby, my clothes just disintegrate,\u201d he shrugs, grinning.</p><p>My stomach plummets off to a very happy place.</p><p>Unzipping my dress, I step out of it. Watching Jake watch me, I kick off my ballet pumps, and very slowly remove my underwear.</p><p>I\u2019m just about to put the bikini on when Jake says in a gruff voice, \u201cOn second thought, if I remember right, you were topless that day, and you know how I hate panties on you...\u201d</p><p>Coming close, he takes them from my hand and tosses them to the floor. He kisses me hard on the mouth. Then sliding his hand into mine, he breaks our kiss, leaving me breathless and wanting, and starts to pull me in the direction of the water.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going in?\u201d I tread carefully over the flat rocks.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want us to go skinny dipping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, most definitely.\u201d He gives me a cheeky look.</p><p>\u201cOh no, Jake. No way. It\u2019ll be freezing.\u201d This so was not part of my plan.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a warm night,\u201d he coaxes. \u201cThe water won\u2019t be that cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will,\u201d I press.</p><p>Jake stops, turning to me. \u201cThe last time we were here, we were in the water ... and tonight I want to see you ... wet.\u201d His voice has gone all dark and sultry, and is completely laced with inclination.</p><p>Honestly, I\u2019m wet just listening to him, and my stomach has turned to molten lava, heating my insides.</p><p>But it\u2019s still not enough to want me to freeze to death in that cold ass water.</p><p>\u201cAs awesome as that sounds, there is no way in hell that I\u2019m getting in that ass freezing water.\u201d</p><p>I step back, dropping his hand. \u201cLet\u2019s just have sex on the nice warm blanket,\u201d I encourage.</p><p>Jake tilts his head to the side. His look is challenging, and I know exactly what\u2019s he\u2019s thinking.</p><p>\u201cNo way! Don\u2019t you dare, Jake Wethers!\u201d I point my finger at him in warning, taking a step back.</p><p>\u201cNoooo! Argghh!\u201d I scream as he runs at me, grabbing hold of me.</p><p>Picking me up, he hoists me over his shoulder, and kicking and screaming Jake carries me into the water.</p><p>\u201cPut me down!\u201d I yell, laughing, wriggling in his strong arms.</p><p>Jake is laughing. Deep and loud. And I love the sound. It\u2019s been way too long since I last heard him laugh. So I keep wriggling in his arms, readying myself to take the hit of the cold water for him, to make him laugh, to make him feel happiness.</p><p>Jake\u2019s happy, so am I.</p><p>Once he\u2019s waded in to his hips, he slides me down his body, dropping me in the cold water.</p><p>\u201cArghhh! It\u2019s bloody freezing!\u201d I screech as the water chills through me. \u201cYou\u2019re such an arsehole!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a girl,\u201d he chuckles deep and throaty.</p><p>\u201cI am a girl,\u201d I grin.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well you feel like a woman to me,\u201d he says low, his hands going around my waist, pulling me close.</p><p>I can feel he\u2019s hard already. How, in this cold water? I have no clue. But I love that he is for me. That I do this to him.</p><p>Wrapping myself around his body, I hold on tight, as Jake wades us further into the water.</p><p>Once we\u2019re chest deep, I decide to take the plunge. Freeing myself from Jake, I swim out a little and immerse myself into the water, wetting my hair.</p><p>It\u2019s not too bad now I\u2019m acclimatised to it.</p><p>As I surface, I see Jake treading water a few feet before me, staring across at me in the moonlit dark.</p><p>He\u2019s looks so beautiful, all wet with the moon shining down on him. He looks like the star he is.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYou. Then, and now. How beautiful you were back then, and how even more beautiful you are now. How I wish I\u2019d seen you through all those years, and how I\u2019m counting myself as one lucky bastard that I got a second chance to have you in my life ... and that you\u2019re crazy enough to be mine.\u201d</p><p>My heart swells in my chest, replete with love for him. I never knew it possible to love someone as much as I do Jake.</p><p>I can\u2019t ever imagine my life again without him in it, and I don\u2019t ever want to.</p><p>Jake is my everything.</p><p>I swim to him and wrap my arms around his neck. His arms go around me, holding me tight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always be yours.\u201d I kiss his cheek, licking the cool water drops off his skin with my tongue, trailing a lead of gentle sucking kisses to his mouth. \u201cBack then, on that day, I wanted you to make love to me under the waterfall,\u201d I whisper against his lips, casting my glance in the falls\u2019 direction.</p><p>And without another word, I take off swimming for the falls.</p><p>Jake is hot behind me.</p><p>When we hit the cascading water, Jake takes me in his arms, kissing me like it\u2019s the first time, and he makes love to me here under the falls, like those two teenagers wanted to all those years ago.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s using again, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Stuart looks sadly across the table in the coffee shop we\u2019re in, and nods his head once. \u201cYes, I think he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think or you\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he says without hesitation.</p><p>Stuart should know. He lived with Jake, the addict, before.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I sigh, stirring my coffee, I look down into my cup.</p><p>We\u2019re in Boston and it\u2019s two weeks into the US leg of the tour. And Jake\u2019s using drugs again.</p><p>It\u2019s become increasingly apparent over the last week.</p><p>I\u2019ve never lived with an addict before, but the signs are pretty clear.</p><p>He\u2019s not sleeping. His moods are all over the place. His temper is short. He\u2019s drinking more than usual. Fidgety. I could go on.</p><p>After Lumb Falls, we went back to the hotel, happy together, and when we woke in the morning, everything was perfect.</p><p>Jake was Jake again. We spent time with his mum, and my folks. We all had a wonderful few days together in Manchester.</p><p>Then one night everything changed. One phone call changed it all.</p><p>Stuart received a heads up call from the press about a story that was going to be run the following morning. The press had found out about Paul\u2019s death. They dug a little deeper and found out he\u2019d been in prison, and just what he went to prison for.</p><p>There was no way to stop the story, although Jake and Stuart tried.</p><p>So we left Manchester that night, and flew to LA, to Jake\u2019s house.</p><p>My first stay at his place, my new home to be, wasn\u2019t exactly how I had imagined it would be.</p><p>Jake was tense and stressed. I was alone for most of the time.</p><p>When the story hit the news, I lost him. He became introvert. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hoped things would get better once the tour started. Once he had work to focus on.</p><p>They haven\u2019t. They\u2019ve got worse.</p><p>He keeps disappearing off on his own, sometimes even without Dave.</p><p>When I question him as to where he\u2019s been, he says he\u2019s just been having time out to clear his head.</p> <p>Basically, he\u2019s out scoring drugs.</p><p>Jake\u2019s distanced himself from me. From everyone. He only talks to bark out orders to staff on the tour. And the only time I see him resembling something near to the Jake I know, is when he\u2019s on stage performing at the shows. But the minute he\u2019s off stage, he\u2019s back to the same.</p><p>He\u2019s pushing everyone around him away, and I haven\u2019t got a clue what to do. How to help him. I feel completely out of my depth. And so very helpless.</p><p>Helpless to the fact that the man I love is slowly slipping away before my eyes.</p><p>I\u2019ve considered calling his sponsor, even his drug counsellor, but I feel like I\u2019d be crossing some arbitrary line if I do.</p> <p>I just feel at a loss.</p><p>You have no idea how hard it is to try to hold onto someone when they don\u2019t want you to.</p><p>I\u2019ve tried talking to him. He won\u2019t talk to me. He brushes me off, telling me there is nothing wrong.</p><p>There clearly is.</p><p>The story coming out about what he suffered at the hands of his dad that night was the final nail in the coffin for him.</p><p>He could just about cope with Paul dying and the old memories and feelings that resurfaced for him, but this story coming out was too much.</p> <p>I know he feels like he\u2019s been exposed to the world as the weak man he truly believes himself to be. It\u2019s crippled him, and the only way he knows how to deal with that emotion is to conceal it with drugs so he no longer has to feel.</p><p>The flip side of that, which he doesn\u2019t see, is that he stops loving too.</p><p>He\u2019s stopped loving me on some fundamental level.</p><p>It\u2019s still there, buried somewhere deep within him. But for now, this Jake I\u2019ve got here with me, doesn\u2019t love me. Not really. And it\u2019s not because he doesn\u2019t want to, but because he can\u2019t.</p><p>So now it\u2019s up to me to try to find a way to bring him back.</p><p>I think he started using again around the time the tour began here in the US. On some level I think I knew, I just didn\u2019t want to believe it.</p><p>But now it\u2019s become too hard to ignore.</p><p>He went to take a shower this morning and when he came out of the bathroom, I looked up at him and there was blood running from his nose.</p> <p>That\u2019s when I knew what he\u2019d been doing in there.</p><p>He downplayed the nosebleed. Said it was just because he was tired and stressed.</p><p>After I\u2019d cleaned his bleed up, I went in the bathroom looking for evidence of drugs but I couldn\u2019t find any.</p><p>He\u2019s adept at hiding his addiction. Now I just need to figure a way to out it.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d I ask Stuart, dropping my spoon onto the table.</p><p>\u201cConfront him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill he deny it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep trying. But, Tru, he won\u2019t recognise the problem until he\u2019s ready to \u2013 you need to know that, and be ready for the backlash that will undoubtedly come with it when you do confront him.\u201d</p><p>I put my head in my hands. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe he\u2019s back there again.\u201d I lift my head. \u201cThis must be terrible for you, seeing him doing this to himself again ... he told me what happened in LA ... when you found him,\u201d I allude to the rest with my expression.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad he told you. It shows how much he trusts you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you leave him now?\u201d</p><p>Stuart looks at me surprised. \u201cNo. Why do say that?\u201d</p><p>I knot my fingers together around the coffee cup. \u201cBecause Jake said you told him at that time if he carried on using you would leave, and I just thought as he is again ... then maybe you would leave.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t think Jake would cope without Stuart. Honestly, I don\u2019t think I could cope without him. I\u2019ve come to rely on his friendship so much in these last few weeks.</p><p>He shakes his head, smiling. \u201cI\u2019d never leave him. I like the perks too much.\u201d He rolls his eyes, ironic. \u201cJake\u2019s like my family, just like you are now, chica.\u201d He reaches over and squeezes my hand. My eyes fill with tears. \u201cIt was just an empty threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat worked,\u201d I say blotting my eyes with a napkin.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but he was also ready by that point. He knew it, as much as I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what I should do? Threaten to leave him.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. Leaning back in his chair, he pushes hair off his forehead. \u201cAnything is worth a shot, but Jake will only get clean if he truly wants to ... he loves you like no one before. I see the bond you guys have, so maybe the threat of you leaving might shock him into it. I know getting you back in his life meant everything to him. Maybe the thought of losing you again might just push him in the right direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if ...\u201d I pause, swallowing against my own words, eyes down, I tap my fingernails on the table. \u201cWhat if I threaten to leave him, and he still won\u2019t stop using?\u201d</p><p>Stuart leans forward, closer to me. \u201cWell, honey, before you do anything you have to decide if that\u2019s the chance you want to take. The possibility of losing him. I don\u2019t think you would ever lose Jake permanently, but temporarily? Maybe, yes, it could happen, if he\u2019s not ready to face his problem yet.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to lose Jake. Not at all. Not even for a moment. But I don\u2019t want this version of him either.</p><p>\u201cI already lost my Jake the moment he took his first hit,\u201d I sigh, lifting my eyes to meet Stuart\u2019s. \u201cAnd if I have any hope of trying to get him back, then I\u2019m going to have to confront this version of him, and simply go from there, no matter what happens.\u201d</p><p>The second I get back to our suite at the Ritz, I instantly know something is wrong. I can practically feel Jake\u2019s tension radiating through the air as I push open the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere the fuck have you been?!\u201d He\u2019s on me the instant I\u2019m through the door. \u201cDon\u2019t you answer your goddamn cell anymore?!\u201d</p><p>I sigh inwardly. Here we go again.</p><p>\u201cHello to you too,\u201d I bite.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fuckin\u2019 kidding, Tru.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither am I.\u201d I give him a hard stare as I walk past him.</p><p>Getting my phone from my bag I see I have ten missed calls and five voicemails.</p><p>\u201cI was out having coffee with Stuart,\u201d I say putting my phone back in my bag and dropping it onto the table.</p><p>\u201cI called him too and he didn\u2019t answer \u2013 why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not a mind reader. Maybe because he was out with me? Maybe because it\u2019s his day off? Why don\u2019t you ask him?\u201d</p><p>I turn around to see Jake pacing the floor, anger clear on his face.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with him right now, but it seems we are going to have to get past whatever this is before I can have the drugs talk with him.</p><p>\u201cBaby, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d I ask, walking toward him, hands out.</p><p>I\u2019m trying the soft, tactical approach; it\u2019s the only way with him at the moment.</p><p>Jake can be irrational at times. Drug taking Jake \u2013 always irrational.</p><p>\u201cThis is what\u2019s wrong.\u201d He marches away from me, leaving me dead in my tracks, and goes over to the desk, grabs an envelope off it and marches back, shoving it in my hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I look down at it confused.</p><p>\u201cOpen it the fuck up, and then you can answer me the very same question.\u201d</p><p>I stare across at him puzzled, then back down at the envelope.</p><p>Okay, so whatever it is has got him majorly pissed off.</p><p>Apprehensively, I peel the seal back on the envelope, reach in and put my fingers around what feels to be photos.</p><p>Yep, it\u2019s photos.</p><p>Photos of me and Will from Callo\u2019s that last day I saw him.</p><p>One is of Will and me sitting across the table from one another, the next \u2013 Will holding my hand across the table, and the last, a photo of Will and me hugging outside of Callo\u2019s.</p><p>I look up at Jake. \u201cWhere did you get these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking him?\u201d</p><p>I feel like he\u2019s just slapped me.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve what you want, it\u2019s the truth.\u201d I drop the photos onto the coffee table, along with the envelope. \u201cDid you have me followed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Do I need to?\u201d</p><p>I glare at him.</p><p>\u201cThe press sent them,\u201d he fires at me. \u201cThey\u2019re running a story that you\u2019re having an affair with him.\u201d</p><p>I snort at the ridiculousness of it.</p><p>\u201cYou find something funny about this?\u201d He stares at me with glassy eyes.</p><p>He\u2019s high right now. And he\u2019s also not amused.</p><p>Well guess what Jake, neither am I.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say so, yeah.\u201d I drag my hands through my hair. \u201cThe press are about to accuse me of having an affair with Will \u2013 the man who was the one wronged because I had an affair with you. It\u2019s beyond ludicrous! We can\u2019t let this happen. We have to tell the press the truth \u2013 and I need to call Will and warn him about this.\u201d</p><p>I get my phone out of my bag ready to make the call, but Jake lunges forward and grabs it from my hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re screwing around with him, and you\u2019re going to call him here in front of me!\u201d he yells.</p><p>\u201cJake, I\u2019m not cheating on you with Will. Barring the fact that I would never do that to you, when exactly would I do so? I\u2019m with you all the time. And I\u2019m also here in the US, and Will is in the UK. Seriously, please just see sense here, and give me my phone back.\u201d I hold my hand out to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not calling him, Tru.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive. Me. My. Phone. Back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he yells, and throws my phone clear across the room and all I can do is watch as it smashes to pieces against the wall.</p><p>\u201cHave you lost your mind?!\u201d I cry, hand clutching my head. \u201cJesus Christ, Jake! Who is this version of you?! I feel like I don\u2019t even know you anymore!\u201d</p><p>I go over to where my broken phone lays, crouching down, I pick the pieces up and hold them together like I can somehow repair it.</p><p>Staying there for a few moments, I take some deep breaths before speaking again.</p><p>\u201cWhatever issue you have with Will,\u201d I state calmly standing, putting down the remnants of my shattered phone onto the table \u2013 poor Adele. \u201cHe\u2019s done nothing wrong and it\u2019s only fair to warn him if he\u2019s about to get screwed over in the press. He\u2019s got a career to think about. Surely you can understand that.\u201d</p><p>Jake stares at me for a long moment, his chest rising and falling heavily. \u201cI\u2019ll get my lawyers to bury the story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do that?\u201d I feel a huge sense of relief. I don\u2019t want Will getting any more hurt than he has been, and if Jake can stop it then all the better.</p><p>\u201cI can do anything I want.\u201d</p><p>I hate it when he\u2019s arrogant like this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I love sexy arrogant Jake.

We\u2019re not in school here!\u201d Then I pause, collecting myself, realising the yelling is getting us nowhere.</p><p>\u201cJake, I\u2019m not siding with Will,\u201d I say in calmer voice. \u201cI know it must have been a shock for you seeing them like that, but please just try to see reason here, those photos are not what you thought they were. And I get it, this issue you have with Will, I do, but you have to let it go now and trust me. He was the one wronged here, not us.\u201d I take a step closer to him. \u201cI\u2019m with you. I\u2019ll always be with you. I\u2019m not a cheater, as ironic as that sounds. I only did, what I did to Will, with you, because it was you, Jake. Because of how I feel about you. How I\u2019ve always felt about you. I have loved you my whole life. You must know that. Yes, I handled it all so very badly, but I promise you, I will never hurt you like I did Will.\u201d</p><p>His eyes scan my face. \u201cI just need to know if anything happened with Will when you saw him?\u201d</p><p>Am I talking to myself?</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d I\u2019m trying to stay calm, I really am, but I\u2019m struggling at the moment.</p><p>\u201cJust the thought of you with him.\u201d He drags his hands through his hair, looking agonised. \u201cWhen were you going to tell me that you were sleeping with him again?

I saw Will on the day you flew over to London after your dad had died. I\u2019d gone into work in the morning to see Vicky before you were due to arrive. When I left the building, I bumped into Will outside. He\u2019d seen me go in work and waited for me to leave. He just wanted to talk to me. I thought it was the least I could do after what I\u2019d done to him. We went to Callo\u2019s for a coffee. We talked. I cried. He held my hand because I was sad that I\u2019d hurt him. It was good of him after what I\u2019d done. We left Callo\u2019s. He hugged me goodbye outside. And then we went our separate ways and I haven\u2019t seen or heard from him since.\u201d</p><p>Jake is staring at me, but it\u2019s like he\u2019s seeing through me. His pupils are wide and dilated, and I\u2019m wondering if he just heard a word I said.</p><p>\u201cSo why didn\u2019t you just tell me you\u2019d seen him that day?\u201d His voice sounds a little calmer.</p> <p>I almost exhale with relief that my words are finally sinking in and this conversation is seemingly nearly over with. The downside \u2013 next I have to broach the subject of his very apparent drug use.</p><p>\u201cBecause your dad had just died and I knew it would upset and stress you out. You don\u2019t see straight when it comes to Will, baby. I was going to tell you when things had calmed down, but then the story hit the news about your dad ... what happened that night and there\u2019s just never been a right time since.\u201d</p><p>Because you\u2019re using drugs again.</p><p>His face darkens. \u201cSo you just thought you\u2019d keep lying to me instead?!\u201d</p><p>Here we go again. He\u2019s up and down like a goddamn yoyo, and I am so absolutely done with his crap.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?! Don\u2019t you dare, Jake, don\u2019t you bloody dare,\u201d I point an angry finger at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019ve never lied to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm no? Sorry, just when exactly was it you told me that you\u2019d started using drugs again?\u201d</p> <p>He stares evenly at me. \u201cI\u2019m not using.\u201d He frowns. Then he rubs his nose.</p><p>\u201cSure you\u2019re not. So let me get this straight.\u201d I press my fingertips to my forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s not okay for me to hold something back \u2013 like having a coffee with Will, to try and spare your feelings at a terrible point in your life, but it is okay for you to break promises and lie to me about using drugs. Good to know how we roll Jake,\u201d I add sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not using drugs.\u201d He frowns again, and little crease forms between his brows.</p><p>I lean back against the table and fold my arms across my chest. \u201cPlease don\u2019t insult me. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything because I\u2019m not using.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me!\u201d I cry, staring him down, as I straighten up. \u201cI want to know when it started and exactly what it is you\u2019re using?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking lie to me!\u201d I yell. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah like I\u2019m not stupid about what\u2019s been going on behind my back with you and Will.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. I actually laugh at his audacity. \u201cDon\u2019t try turning this back on me because it\u2019s not going to wash. Tell me what you\u2019re using? If you don\u2019t, I\u2019m walking out that door and I\u2019m never coming back.\u201d I ensure to keep my voice steady to let him know I mean it.</p><p>He lets out a light sigh. Stepping back, he leans up against the wall and pushes his hands through his hair.</p><p>\u201cJust a bit of coke,\u201d he says evenly, shrugging.</p><p>Even though I knew, it still pains me to hear. And I feel a corner of my heart chip away.</p><p>\u201cOh no, Jake,\u201d I shake my head despairing. \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know for smart successful guy \u2013 you are a complete bloody idiot at times!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTru...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jake, seriously this isn\u2019t right. Where are they?\u201d My eyes are scanning the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe drugs, Jake! Where are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t any here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me!\u201d</p><p>I start moving around the room, tossing cushions, pulling drawers out, searching the room like a woman possessed.</p><p>Where would an addict keep their drugs? Think, Tru. Think.</p><p>Then I remember him being in the bathroom this morning, and it clicks with something I saw in a film once.</p><p>I rush into the bedroom and head straight toward the ensuite bathroom. Jake is fast on his feet behind me, and that\u2019s when I know I\u2019m heading to the right place.</p><p>I beat him there, and pull the lid off the cistern. And there it is, sitting on top of a pipe.</p><p>A small bag of white powder.</p><p>Cocaine, I\u2019m guessing.</p><p>Picking it up, holding it between my fingers, I turn to him.</p><p>His face is ashen.</p><p>My whole body is shaking with anger and fear. Fear mostly.</p><p>I hold the bag of cocaine up in front of me. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>He looks down, away from me.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been back using? Or did you never stop? Have you been on this crap the whole time we\u2019ve been back in each other\u2019s lives?\u201d</p><p>His eyes snap up to mine. \u201cNo. When I said I was clean I was telling you the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took my first hit in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>I gasp. \u201cThe first show of the tour?\u201d My words come out tinny and small.</p><p>Even though I had thought this to be the case, it\u2019s still just so hard to hear.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d my voice wobbles. My throat is thick with tears.</p><p>He shakes his head, shrugging. \u201cI was just on edge and ... I needed something to take it off to get me through the show. It\u2019s not a big deal, Tru.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a big deal?! Are you being bloody serious?!\u201d I expostulate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not addicted,\u201d he shakes his head</p><p>\u201cHow many times have you used since Chicago?\u201d</p><p>He shifts on his feet. Not meeting my eyes, he says, \u201cOnce, twice \u2013 max.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s lying. Fear starts to spread through me like weaving spider webs.</p><p>\u201cHow. Many. Times?\u201d</p><p>He sighs and leans back against the tiled wall. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that to be every day then.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t argue the fact, so I get my answer. And my blood runs cold.</p><p>He\u2019s been high for the last two weeks straight. High when we\u2019ve eaten dinner together. Watched TV together. Every time he\u2019s kissed me. Made love to me. He\u2019s had this crap in his body.</p><p>It tarnishes it all.</p><p>I feel lied to and cheated, and so very angry and it just all suddenly bursts right out of me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this, Jake! You promised me you would never get back on this crap! Back at Lumb Falls you promised!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well things change.\u201d His voice is low and cold, and he doesn\u2019t sound like the Jake I know.</p><p>The Jake I love.</p><p>Tears are squeezing at my eyes. Feeling suddenly lost and adrift, I lower my hand which is still holding the little bag of cocaine.</p><p>I see Jake\u2019s eyes follow it down like his life depends on it.</p><p>Disappointment, and an ache so raw, courses through me and I fear it will tear me right open.</p><p>I\u2019m losing the man I love to this trash in my hand, and I have no clue how to stop it from happening.</p><p>\u201cLook it\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d he says. His voice has changed again, it\u2019s gentle, his expression softened. \u201cI just take a little bit to get me through the day that\u2019s all. It\u2019s nothing for you to worry about, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t need this crap to get you through the day at all,\u201d I whisper, my voice breaking over the words. \u201cIt\u2019s not right, Jake. You know this. You\u2019ve been here before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not addicted. I\u2019ve got it under control this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what an addict would say.\u201d I bite the inside of my cheek to stop myself from bursting into tears. \u201cJust like the addict who pissed on stage in front of thousands of people ... like the addict who nearly drowned.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrow. His jaw is clenched, I can see it working under his skin.</p><p>I know he\u2019s trying to hold his anger in. For now.</p><p>\u201cThat was different.\u201d His voice is measured, even. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in control then. I\u2019m in control now \u2013 and I didn\u2019t have you then, baby.\u201d He tries to step near me, but I hold my hand up stopping him.</p><p>\u201cYou have me now, but you\u2019re still using this crap. That doesn\u2019t stick, Jake. That\u2019s not a well formed reason you have there. I don\u2019t think this is different to the last time at all. I think you\u2019ll end up right back where you were, floating face down in a goddamn swimming pool dead if you keep up with this!\u201d</p><p>His gaze practically tears through me. I know that was harsh but I need to shock some sense into him.</p><p>\u201cI know things are hard for you at the moment. I know you\u2019ve been struggling since your dad died, and the story getting out about that night \u2013 what he did to you, and I know you\u2019re under pressure with the tour and\u2013\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you?!\u201d he hollers at me. The level of his anger actually makes me jump out of my suddenly cold skin. \u201cBecause honestly I don\u2019t think you have a fuckin\u2019 clue! What do you do Tru? You write a stupid little column in a crappy fuckin\u2019 magazine! Me? I run a fuckin\u2019 music label and a band, taking care of everyone else, while simultaneously touring, so you know what \u2013 I don\u2019t think you know shit all about the kind of pressure I\u2019m under!\u201d</p><p>I feel winded. I know that\u2019s not him talking, but it doesn\u2019t make it hurt any less.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jake. It\u2019s good to know how I sit in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>I push past him, heading back into the living room.</p> <p>He follows me.</p><p>Stopping, I turn around. I\u2019ve only got my one card left to play.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re struggling, that\u2019s clear, and I know your life is pressured at the moment, but I can\u2019t put up with the drug taking.\u201d I hold the bag of crap up again, for the last time. \u201cIt\u2019s me or this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His eyes widen with disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYou heard. You either go back to rehab and get clean, or I\u2019m gone. I won\u2019t stick around and watch you screw your life up again.\u201d My whole body is trembling under the weight of my words.</p> <p>All emotion disappears from his face, and he takes a deep breath in through his nose. \u201cAgain? Sorry were you here the last time?\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes tight shut, taking a deep breath in myself. Then I open them. \u201cNo. And why was that, Jake?\u201d I stare hard at him. \u201cIt\u2019s me or this?\u201d I repeat, lifting the bag higher.</p><p>His jaw tenses, his eyes slip out of focus, then narrow back onto mine with a new determinedness in them. \u201cI don\u2019t do ultimatums.\u201d</p><p>A pain hits me hard in the chest. He\u2019s made his decision. He\u2019s way more gone than I had realised.</p><p>As I blink through the agony, a tear runs from my eye. I wipe it away with my sleeve. Then I toss the bag of coke to him.</p><p>It hits his chest, and drops to the floor.</p> <p>\u201cHave a wonderful life with your drugs, Jake.\u201d</p><p>I swivel on my heel, feeling more tears coming, I make to leave.</p><p>Jake grabs me from behind, pulling me back to him. \u201cTru, no, I don\u2019t want you to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have both!\u201d I cry in his face.</p><p>\u201cStop acting like a child!\u201d A sudden callous anger bleeds through his voice, and he leans his face close to mine, his fingers gripping my arm to the point of almost pain.</p><p>\u201cMe?! I\u2019m not the one acting like a child!\u201d I remonstrate. \u201cI think you need to take a good long look in the mirror!\u201d</p><p>His face contorts, and for a moment I don\u2019t recognise him.</p><p>He releases me, pushing me away. \u201cFuck you. I can do what the fuck I want, and if I want to shovel coke up my nose all day long then I will \u2013 because it\u2019s my life. I got by just fine before you turned back up, interfering with your holier than now attitude. I didn\u2019t need you then, and I certainly don\u2019t need you now.\u201d</p> <p>I sharp in a breath, his words chilling my skin to my bones.</p><p>And in this moment all I want to do is hurt him, just like he\u2019s hurting me.</p><p>\u201cYou know what Jake. You were right \u2013 you are just exactly like your dad.\u201d</p><p>He looks like I\u2019ve hit him, hard.</p><p>Then his face smooth\u2019s, his eyes fixing onto mine. \u201cIf that\u2019s the way you feel. Then you know where the door is.\u201d His voice is cold, emotionless, and terrifying calm.</p><p>It\u2019s his ultimatum.</p><p>And I\u2019m so hurt and angry that I can\u2019t see straight at the moment.</p><p>\u201cIt is. I can\u2019t do this with you anymore. I\u2019m done.\u201d Lifting my chin, I turn on my heel, grab my bag and slam my way of the hotel room.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>My heart is hurting deep inside my chest. I\u2019m confused. My thoughts are all in a muddle.</p><p>And all I can see every time I close my eyes is the look on Jake\u2019s face when I said to him that he was just exactly like his dad.</p><p>I didn\u2019t mean it.</p><p>Of course I didn\u2019t. I regretted the words the instant they left my mouth. But my pride wouldn\u2019t let me take them back.</p><p>Jake could never be like Paul. He\u2019s warm and loving ... tender and so very kind.</p><p>He\u2019s just lost at the moment, and he needs help.</p><p>But I\u2019m not sure how to help him, or if I\u2019m even the one who can.</p><p>Still, though, I walked out and left him at the point when he needs me most. What kind of person does that?</p><p>I know he said some shitty things, but so did I.</p><p>Honestly, my behaviour of late has left me questioning myself and my morals.</p><p>Not long ago I told Jake that I would never leave him, no matter what.</p><p>Last night I did just that. I broke my promise to him.</p><p>I kicked his ass about broken promises and then I go and do exactly the same.</p><p>Rolling over, I look at the clock for the hundredth time in the last hour.</p><p>It\u2019s 5:30am and I\u2019m laid in a cold, empty bed in a Best Western Hotel here in Boston.</p><p>I haven\u2019t slept all night. I\u2019ve just laid here in the dark, watching it through to light. Running things over and over in my mind, trying to figure out what to do for best.</p><p>After I left the Ritz, I walked around the city for hours.</p><p>Knowing I couldn\u2019t go back to our hotel, and having nowhere else to go, and no phone to call anyone on, I checked into the next hotel I happened upon in my price range.</p><p>Once in the room, I took a shower, washing my hair with the hotel provided shampoo. Then I dried it using the hotel hairdryer. It was small, and smelt of singed hair, and it took me forever to dry my hair, but I did it because I need something to focus on. Something to keep me busy.</p><p>Then I watched mindless TV for hours until I could no longer stand it.</p><p>And now, for the last four or so hours, I\u2019ve had nothing to keep my mind busy, so I\u2019m forced to think about mine and Jake\u2019s fight.</p><p>What am I going to do?</p><p>I was so angry with him last night. Angry that he\u2019d let himself get back there. Angry he\u2019d lied about using drugs, and that he\u2019d kept it from me.</p><p>But I\u2019m not angry anymore. Now I\u2019m worried, and so very afraid. For him. For us.</p><p>If there is still an us left.</p><p>I just don\u2019t know what to do, what's best for him?</p><p>I wish I could talk to my dad about this, get his advice. But I don\u2019t want him to know what state Jake is in. And god, if I told my mum she\u2019d fly out here and carry me home kicking and screaming, I know that for sure.</p><p>I don\u2019t have Stuart\u2019s number to call him. It was in my phone, the phone which Jake broke in his little fit of rage.</p><p>And I don\u2019t want to call Simone and put all this on her. Not while she\u2019s all loved up in Denny world. Also I don\u2019t want to put her in a position where she has to lie to Denny about Jake\u2019s drug taking, if he doesn\u2019t already know himself.</p><p>I\u2019m on my own in this one, and will have to figure it out for myself.</p><p>One thing I do know is I can\u2019t stay here forever, hiding from Jake and his ... our problem.</p><p>All my things are at the Ritz, and right now I\u2019m still in yesterday\u2019s clothes and panties. I need clean underwear if anything.</p><p>I know I have to go back, it\u2019s just ... my pride is digging its pretty little heels in at the moment.</p><p>No, come on, Tru. You\u2019ve been gone all night. You\u2019ve left him stewing for long enough; you\u2019ve made your point.</p><p>He has the show to do tonight at TD Garden. Go now and talk to him. Spend today sorting through this. Jake is too important to leave hanging for any longer.</p><p>I climb out of bed. I\u2019m already in my clothes, so I just make a quick trip to the bathroom and then grabbing my bag, I leave the room.</p><p>I drop my key card in at the reception, and step out onto the early morning Boston street.</p><p>There are no cabs to be seen.</p><p>Feeling frustrated, I start to walk in the direction of where I think the Ritz is.</p><p>As I walk, I see posters up for Jake\u2019s show tonight. Funny how I didn\u2019t notice them yesterday when I was still majorly pissed at him.</p><p>I stop and look up the huge bill board, with Jake, Tom and Denny on it, staring back down at me.</p><p>I can see it in Jake\u2019s eyes. The lost look. The one no one else sees. The look that only I can take away for him.</p><p>Suddenly, I feel such an overwhelming sense of love for him that it compounds, and covets me.</p><p>He\u2019s screwed up, but he\u2019s my screwed up. And I can\u2019t be without him, no matter what.</p><p>I\u2019m so desperate to see him in this moment. I just need to get to him and right things between us.</p><p>We can get through his problem together. I can be strong enough for the both of us.</p><p>Catching sight of a cab with its light on heading toward me, I run out into the street and flag it down.</p><p>Jumping in the back, I pant breathless, \u201cThe Ritz-Carlton.\u201d</p><p>The cab pulls away and I fall back against the seat, filled with nervous anxiety at seeing Jake.</p><p>When the cab pulls up outside the Ritz, I pay the fare, and climb out onto seriously wobbly legs.</p><p>I\u2019m so nervous about facing him after what we said to each other.</p><p>No, this is Jake. I can do this.</p><p>Kicking my shaky legs into action, I make my way through the empty early morning lobby, and straight into the waiting lift to take me up to Jake.</p><p>He\u2019ll probably be still sleeping, so I\u2019ll have to wake him because I don\u2019t want to wait any longer for us to talk this through.</p><p>I put the key card in and press the button for the twelfth floor, to take me up to the Presidential Suite where we\u2019re staying.</p><p>The lift starts to ascend, and I stand here hands knotted in front of me, stomach turning over, as I jig my leg on the spot. And I\u2019m reminded of the time I was riding the lift going to do his interview, those few short months ago.</p><p>So much has happened since then.</p><p>The lift stops and the doors ping open.</p><p>I instantly know something is wrong the second I step out onto the landing.</p><p>There are bottles of alcohol laid discarded on the floor, cigarette butts trodden into the carpet, and what looks to be a woman\u2019s top there too.</p><p>Going over to it, I bend down and pick it up. It\u2019s red with the word \u2019Hussy\u2019 wrote in the black on the front.</p><p>My stomach drops hollow.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to go in there. I don\u2019t want to see what\u2019s behind the door.</p><p>But I have to, I know.</p><p>Taking a deep breath in through my nose, I carefully push my key card in. I hear the little beep and the click of the lock opening, and very quietly, I push the door open.</p><p>The place is a mess.</p><p>Littered with bottles of booze, sleeping bodies, some clothed, some not.</p><p>The whole place absolutely reeks of sweat, booze and cigarettes.</p><p>Jake had a party.</p><p>We had a fight. I spent the whole night worrying over him. And he had a party.</p><p>The knowledge makes me feel sick.</p><p>Obviously me leaving him meant nothing to him at all.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019s been waiting for me to go all along. Maybe this is what he\u2019s wanted for a while now.</p><p>I guess this was the wake for the funeral of our relationship. Or celebration, depending on which way you look at it.</p><p>This is Jake. He\u2019s a rock star who parties, takes drugs and sleeps with groupies.</p><p>He\u2019s not a relationship kind of guy. I was just foolish enough to make myself believe for a little while he was because I wanted him so badly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Irrespective, I still need to talk to him.

But now I\u2019m starting to think maybe it was never there in the first place.</p><p>Walking slowly to the bedroom, my heart beats a steady pain in my chest.</p> <p>The bedroom door is closed.</p><p>Reaching out my trembling hand, I lace my fingers over the handle, and take a deep breath in.</p><p>Please let him be alone in there. Please. I can just about forgive the partying and the drugs. But anything else, no.</p><p>I push down on the handle and slowly open the door.</p><p>My heart bangs hard, once, against my chest, then sinks down into my stomach.</p><p>And I look on feeling like my world has comes crashing down all around me, as I stare at the sight of Jake in bed with another woman.</p> <p>He\u2019s faced away from me, but I know it\u2019s him, I\u2019d know that tattooed body anywhere.</p><p>For a moment, I literally don\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>I\u2019m paralysed.</p><p>The the life I envisaged with Jake flashes before my eyes, then very slowly, and very painfully slides from out of my vision.</p><p>My bag slips off my shoulder and drops to the floor with a thud.</p><p>The girl stirs, opening her heavily made up eyes, rubbing them to panda, she focus in on me standing here in the doorway.</p><p>She\u2019s wearing only a bra, and I\u2019m hoping, panties under the sheets.</p><p>I feel physically sick. Sicker than I have ever felt before in my whole life.</p> <p>She frowns at me, and I feel like an intruder.</p><p>Then I see what I think is a flicker of recognition in her eyes, almost like she knows me.</p><p>But I for sure as hell don\u2019t know her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in here?\u201d she asks in a not-so-nice-voice.</p><p>I open my mouth, ready to ask her the very same fucking question, but nothing happens. I\u2019m like a goddamn gold fish. The one time I need my mouth to work and it fails on me.</p><p>Giving me a dark look, she reaches her hand over and shakes Jake.</p><p>He groans. Rolling over onto his back, he reaches his hand out and mumbles, \u201cTru.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth again but it still won\u2019t work.</p><p>I know I should be screaming, shouting, doing something, but I just can\u2019t seem to get my brain and body to function. I haven\u2019t even blinked yet.</p><p>Jake\u2019s eyes open slowly, garnering focus.</p><p>He sees the girl first. I see confusion gather on his face, then his head turns, almost as if in slow motion, and he sees me standing here in the doorway.</p><p>His expression freezes. Then he jumps up out of bed.</p><p>I don\u2019t why, but I feel relief that he\u2019s still wearing his boxer shorts. Like that somehow makes it better, even though I\u2019ve just found him in bed with another woman.</p><p>\u201cOh no! Nononono!\u201d He holds his hands up, advancing around the bed, coming toward me.</p><p>The very bed we made love in two nights ago. The bed he told me he loved me in. The bed that he\u2019s just slept in, with her. Done ... whatever, with her.</p><p>\u201cNo, Tru! This is not what you think!\u201d He stops a few feet away from me.</p><p>I stare blankly across at him. I can\u2019t do anything else.</p><p>And right here and now, I know exactly how Will felt when I told him about Jake and me. At least I saved him from the actual burning image of it in his mind, like this is now chagrined into mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing in here?!\u201d Jake roars at the girl, turning in her direction.</p><p>She visibly flinches. Then she scurries up out of bed, retrieving her dress from the floor, pulling it on quickly, and putting her feet her tacky black heels.</p><p>\u201cTru...\u201d Jake takes a step forward, moving closer to me.</p><p>I step back, bumping with the open door.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have sex with her. I swear to you \u2013 tell her!\u201d he turns on the girl again. \u201cTell her I didn\u2019t have sex with you!\u201d</p><p>She looks at me defiant. And in this moment, I see how young she actually is. Nineteen \u2013 twenty, max.</p><p>Walking toward us, passing between Jake and me, she simply smiles sweetly at me, shrugs and walks through the open doorway.</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d Jake roars. \u201cTru, she\u2019s lying! I didn\u2019t have sex with her! TELL THE FUCKIN\u2019 TRUTH! TELL HER I NEVER TOUCHED YOU!\u201d</p><p>But the girl is well out of the room, moving quickly out of the suite, avoiding Jake\u2019s wrath.</p><p>The whole place is waking from Jake\u2019s anger and I see the place start to empty of people, leaving just me and him.</p><p>But they don\u2019t matter to me. The girl doesn\u2019t matter to me. Nothing matters anymore. Because I\u2019ve just lost the one thing that did truly ever matter.</p><p>Everything now is inconsequential.</p><p>Jake\u2019s hands are in his hair, he\u2019s pacing the floor. He looks like he\u2019s in physical pain.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know she was in here. I swear.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s talking to me, or himself right now.</p><p>I still can\u2019t seem to feel anything. It\u2019s as if the agony of seeing him in bed with her was so severe, the instant it hit my vision, my body instinctively shut down.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t sleep with her, Tru.\u201d He\u2019s standing before me again. \u201cI swear to you. On everything I love, I swear I did not sleep with her. You have to believe me.\u201d His voice is desperate.</p><p>I drag my eyes to his, my mind still frozen, suspended in this horrific time zone he\u2019s trapped me in.</p><p>\u201cSay something, please.\u201d His voice begs me.</p><p>My eyes move from him, over to the messed up sheets on the bed.</p><p>I feel a tear trickle out of the corner of my eye.</p><p>\u201cNo, Tru, no! You have to listen to me \u2013 I didn\u2019t have sex with her. I swear to you. After we fought and you left, I was so angry, but then I calmed down, and I missed you so much, and I wanted to tell you how sorry I was \u2013 that I love you \u2013 that I would do whatever you wanted me to \u2013 I\u2019d go to rehab if it meant keeping you in my life. But I didn\u2019t know where you were \u2013 no one did, and I couldn\u2019t call you on your cell because I was a dumb fuck and I broke it. So I took the car and drove around the city for hours, looking everywhere trying to find you \u2013 but you were nowhere \u2013 and I was getting so worried, so I came back here to the hotel, and I sat in the bar facing the lobby, waiting for you to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t come. And I sat there for hours drinking, and watching the door, waiting, and I was going out of my mind over you, and then before I knew it I was drunk, and these people had joined me in the bar. And I was hurting because you\u2019d left, so I drank more and more, and then I took some coke, and the next thing I know they\u2019re all back up here drinking and partying, and you still weren\u2019t back Tru ... and I took more coke ... and,\u201d he rubs his swollen, glassy eyes. \u201cI just remember coming in here, and then I must have passed out. But I wasn\u2019t with any girl \u2013 I promise you. I would never do that to you. She-she must have come in here after I\u2019d passed out and\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d My voice comes out broken, so I try again. \u201cWhy would she come in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d His hands go to his head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand any of it, but I\u2019m telling you I didn\u2019t have sex with her.\u201d</p><p>I hear his words, but I don\u2019t believe them. I don\u2019t believe him.</p><p>It\u2019s over.</p><p>Everything I envisaged with him, our life together, gone.</p><p>Tears start to trickle down my cheeks in quick succession, one after the other. I feel like I can\u2019t breathe, like someone is compressing down hard on my chest, taking the life right out of me.</p><p>Then Jake\u2019s grabbing hold of me, pulling me to him, crushing me to his chest, his arms tight around me, his face buried into my hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, baby. I\u2019m so, so sorry,\u201d he repeats, his voice broken, as I sob silently into his chest, my tears slick against his skin. \u201cI love you so much. I\u2019ll make this right, I promise you. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>His heat is all over me. I breathe in through my nose. He smells of Jake, everything Jake.</p><p>Everything I love.</p><p>There\u2019s no trace of perfume on him, or any womanly scent of any kind, but then what does that account for anyway. I saw it clear with my own two eyes.</p><p>Jake in bed with her.</p><p>And then that\u2019s all I can see. I can see his hands on her, just like they were that redhead\u2019s in Paris. Touching her, kissing her, being with her like he is with me. Saying the things to her which were once reserved only for me.</p><p>And that\u2019s when the real pain hits in all its excruciating glory.</p><p>I never knew a pain like this existed. All consuming, and it\u2019s crushing me to nothing.</p><p>I need him to stop touching me. I need him to stop talking. I just want him away from me. Far, far away from me. I can\u2019t have his tainted body anywhere near me.</p><p>He\u2019s wrecked everything, forever.</p><p>I start to move in his arms, trying to free myself, but he keeps his hold tight on me.</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d I push myself free from him, staggering backwards.</p><p>He looks pained and afraid.</p><p>\u201cTru ... please...\u201d He holds his hand out to me.</p><p>And standing here, looking at him, disgusted by him, by what he\u2019s done to me \u2013 to us, I know what I have to do.</p><p>I can\u2019t live this life with him, no matter what I may have thought earlier.</p><p>I could have handled the drugs.</p><p>But not cheating.</p><p>Maybe it makes me a hypocrite, I don\u2019t really care. But I just know I can\u2019t live a life tainted with his betrayal, and the perpetual fear that would always be in the back of my mind that he\u2019s going to do this to me again one day soon.</p><p>And without another word, I turn from him, and go to get my suitcase from the walk-in closet.</p><p>I lay it out open on the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He\u2019s behind me.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it look like?\u201d I reply bitterly, as I start to pull my clothes off their hangers, dropping them into my case.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving me? You\u2019re not even going to talk to me about this \u2013 you\u2019re just going to walk away? Throw us away?\u201d</p><p>I round on him, one of my skirts still in my hand. \u201cI\u2019m not the one who threw us away! We had a fight \u2013 about your goddamn drug taking! I go out to clear my head, I stay in a crappy hotel for the night, thinking things through \u2013 what the best thing to do for you is \u2013 for us, and then I come back here to talk things through with you, and I find you in bed with a ... FUCKING GIRL! SO YES JAKE \u2013 I\u2019M LEAVING YOU!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t touch her, Tru \u2013 I swear I didn\u2019t touch her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI DON\u2019T BELIEVE YOU!\u201d I scream. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He steps back, looking like I\u2019ve just slapped him.</p><p>I wish I had.</p><p>\u201cYou have to believe me,\u201d he says quieter, his voice breaking. \u201cPlease, Tru. You have to.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m panting for breath so hard I feel like my lungs are going to explode. I clutch my hand to it, the one still holding the skirt, trying to steady my breathing.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to do a goddamn thing,\u201d I say low, wiping the still running tears from my face with the palm of my hand.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t lose you, Tru. Please.\u201d</p><p>He reaches for me again, but I step out of his reach.</p><p>\u201cGet away from me!\u201d I cry. \u201cI don\u2019t want you near me ever again! And you don\u2019t want to lose me? Well you should have thought of that before you went on your bender with your tramp!\u201d</p><p>I drop the skirt in the case. Then I go to the drawers and get my underwear out.</p> <p>\u201cBut you said you\u2019d move to LA. We\u2019re supposed to be living together. You promised me you would never leave me.\u201d</p><p>I laugh bitterly, finally bringing myself to look at him. And when my eyes meet with him, all I feel is anger and pain lance straight through me.</p><p>\u201cYeah well things change,\u201d I say calmly, using his own words from last night against him. \u201cYou changed everything forever the second you let her into our bed.\u201d It hurts so very badly to say the words out loud.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI DON\u2019T BELIEVE YOU!\u201d I scream at him again.</p><p>Pausing for a moment, with my hands on either side of the open drawer, I cling to it for support.</p> <p>Then after a few silent seconds, I carry on packing my things into my case.</p><p>Jake stands here, his hands in his hair, eyes fixed on my every movement.</p><p>I just wish he\u2019d go. I don\u2019t want him anywhere near me.</p><p>When I\u2019ve got most of my clothes and can no longer stand to have him here watching me, I drag my suitcase past him and into to the bedroom.</p><p>Jake follows me.</p><p>I leave my suitcase on the bedroom floor and go into the bathroom. I quickly gather my toiletries up and come back into the bedroom to find Jake standing beside my case.</p><p>Ignoring him, I dump my things in and zip it up. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever packed so quickly in my life.</p><p>I stand my case upright, ready to leave.</p> <p>Jake moves before me. I drag my tear stained eyes up to his.</p><p>He\u2019s crying.</p><p>I watch as he rubs his tears roughly from his face with his hand. I\u2019ve never seen Jake cry before. It hurts my heart so much.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t go. Just stay, talk to me, we can work this out. I know we can. I would never cheat on you \u2013 I swear to you. Just believe me, please. I love you so much. You\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve ever loved. And I know I\u2019ve screwed up with the drugs, but I would never cheat on you. You\u2019re my best friend. You\u2019re my everything.\u201d His voice is broken, just like my heart.</p><p>For a tiny moment, I feel a wobble.</p><p>I could stay, we could work this out. Maybe this pain will stop, if I stay with him. Maybe he can fix this.</p><p>No. He\u2019s had sex with another woman. It\u2019s too late.</p><p>Wordlessly, I walk away from him and go back into the closet, to get my passport from the safe.</p><p>Jake is in front of my case, blocking it when I get back.</p><p>He sees the passport in my hand, and his face breaks.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me,\u201d he begs.</p><p>\u201cMove Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMOVE!\u201d I try to push him out of the way, but he won\u2019t budge, it\u2019s like trying to move a wall.</p><p>He grabs hold of my arms trying to stop me, to keep me with him.</p><p>Fighting against him, I push him away from me, hitting him in the chest as I do.</p><p>\u201cFine. I don\u2019t need my stuff \u2013 keep it.\u201d I walk to the bedroom door, picking up my bag off the floor, I shove my passport in it.</p><p>\u201cTru please!\u201d Jake comes after me, grabbing my arm, pulling me back to him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go. I can fix this \u2013 just give me a chance to make it right.\u201d His voice is desperate, broken, just like his expression.</p><p>In this moment, all I can do is stare at him. There are so many words streaming through my mind, but I can\u2019t seem to grab hold of a single one to say to him.</p><p>He drops to his knees before me, holding my hands like his life depends on it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m begging you.\u201d He\u2019s crying again. \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me. I can\u2019t live without you.\u201d</p><p>I weaken again, then I look up and see the bed, the messed up sheets.</p><p>Jake asked that girl to tell me the truth \u2013 to tell me that they hadn\u2019t had sex.</p><p>She had nothing to lose by telling me they hadn\u2019t, and she said nothing, but alluded to a lot.</p><p>And irrespective of her, I don\u2019t believe him. I know who and what Jake is. I\u2019ve always known, I just wanted to see something else for a time.</p><p>Now, I believe what my eyes saw.</p><p>My trust in him is broken \u2013 gone forever \u2013 and without that, we have nothing.</p><p>I look down at his beautiful face for a long moment, taking him in one last time.</p><p>Then I let him go.</p><p>\u201cWe started on a mistake Jake, so it makes sense that we end on one.\u201d</p><p>I yank my hands free from his, leaving him knelt on the floor, I turn away and walk out of the room.</p><p>And out of his life.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Eight</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel forced into doing anything my darling ... it\u2019s just the publishing house are being very insistent that the last show is covered as part of the biography. They\u2019re saying they won\u2019t run the book without it...\u201d</p><p>Vicky\u2019s soft voice is relentless down the phone.</p><p>I lay back on my mum and dads sofa, curling my legs up, tucking my feet under my bum, and stare up at the ceiling.</p><p>There\u2019s a crack in the far corner. I wonder if my dad knows it\u2019s there? I should tell him so he can fix it.</p><p>\u201c...and I know this must be so hard for you, my darling, and honestly, I\u2019ll go with whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause.</p><p>Oh, she\u2019s stopped talking. That means I have to.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Vicky,\u201d I exhale. \u201cWhen I said to you I would do it, I meant it. You don\u2019t have to worry about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do, my darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and I love you for it. And for letting me work from home this last week \u2013 well from my folks anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to work at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. You\u2019ve given me far too much time off as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTru, you\u2019ve just had your lovely heart broken in the worst kind of way, you need time to get yourself together.\u201d</p><p>She means publically.</p><p>It\u2019s bad enough having your heart broken by the love of your life, but when the rest of the world is feeding off that heartbreak it makes it hurt just that bit more.</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut forcing back the tears I can feel threatening. \u201cThank you, but honestly I just need to keep busy. Working keeps me busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that, honey. But this work we\u2019re talking about you doing now \u2013 the bio, involves ... Jake,\u201d she says his name like it\u2019s a swear word.</p><p>Which it kind of is to me right now. It makes me wince just hearing it out loud.</p><p>\u201cIt means you\u2019re going to have to see him again. Spend time around him.\u201d</p><p>I let out a light sigh. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>And this is why you never mix business with pleasure as I\u2019m learning fast.</p><p>I knew getting involved with Jake while working for him was a little risky, but I ignored that small voice in my head because I figured it was Jake.</p><p>Jake who I\u2019ve known and loved forever.</p><p>I never foresaw anything like this happening. That I would ever lose him again. So back then it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Now it does.</p><p>Because not only do I have to go and spend time around him again, but I have to write this damn book about him.</p><p>I really have no clue how I\u2019m going to manage to do it after everything that has happened between us.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to look on the cleansing side of it. Thinking that writing about Jake will be therapeutic. A way of getting him out of my system and letting him go for good.</p><p>Well that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to tell myself.</p><p>The publishing house is pushing for the book because I\u2019m the one who has been cheated on by Jake, and they're relishing the thought of a book wrote about Jake Wethers by the woman he betrayed.</p><p>Hence the push to get me back to the show, and back to him.</p><p>I\u2019m also not stupid. I know Jake is ultimately behind this; this is his way of trying to force me to talk to him, to see him.</p><p>The publishing house has been onto Vicky, saying the last show of the tour in New York has to be covered for the book, which is in two days. And if I don\u2019t attend and cover it, they will pull the exclusive from the magazine and the book will be dropped.</p><p>That\u2019s all Jake.</p><p>He\u2019s got the publishing house doing his dirty work for him, pulling the strings, making it appear it\u2019s them forcing this not him. But I know it\u2019s him.</p><p>Jake\u2019s very adept at getting people to do want he wants. I know that all too well.</p><p>And, it appears, he\u2019s once again going to get me to do what he wants.</p><p>I hate that I can\u2019t fight him on this. I want to. More than I can explain. I want to dig my heels in and say I won\u2019t do it, but I can\u2019t risk this for Vicky. The magazine is everything to her. And she means so much to me. She\u2019s one of my closest friends, and I won\u2019t let her down.</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen or spoken to Jake since I left five days ago.</p><p>When I left the hotel room and him, I got the next available flight out to Manchester and came straight home to my mum and dads instead of going to London. I just wanted to hide.</p><p>Jake found me anyway.</p><p>I was being stupid. Of course Jake would know if I wasn\u2019t in London there would only be one other place I\u2019d go.</p><p>In hindsight, I should have checked into a hotel, but I was hurting and I just wanted my daddy and mama.</p><p>Jake was calling my folks house pretty much on the hour, every hour for the first day. My dad spoke to him. I refused to. I don\u2019t know what was said.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to know.</p><p>Oh actually that\u2019s a lie, I know one thing. I overheard my dad telling my mum that Jake was going to walk out on the tour. That he was going to fly here to see me. Like he thinks he can just turn up here and I\u2019d see him \u2013 not bloody likely \u2013 but my dad talked him down.</p><p>He said he would work on getting me to speak to Jake.</p><p>He\u2019s had no luck so far.</p><p>Jake sends flowers every day. I bin them. He sends letters. I tear them up without reading.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to know a thing from him, or about him.</p><p>But then it\u2019s pretty hard going being who Jake is, and the fact that our relationship, or once was relationship, is current tabloid fodder for the daily\u2019s thanks to his trampy little slut.</p><p>So now I can\u2019t even go online or watch the TV for fear of seeing something new about us in the news.</p><p>The girl I found in Jake\u2019s bed, Kaitlyn Poole is her name \u2013 I hate her, just getting that in there \u2013 sold her story to a US tabloid, and now it is worldwide news.</p><p>She\u2019s claiming that she and Jake have been having an affair the whole time he\u2019s been with me, and the press are lapping it right up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Do I believe that?</p><p>Right now I\u2019m struggling to consider anything about the situation as a whole, because I can\u2019t get my mind past the image of him in bed with her.</p><p>Kaitlyn \u2018Bitch\u2019, as I refer to her, has pictures of Jake in bed from that night. They weren\u2019t clear pictures, kind of dark, taken with a camera phone I\u2019m guessing. And he looked sort of asleep in them. Well his eyes were closed. But that doesn\u2019t mean anything. My eyes are closed in tons of pictures because I always blink when the flash goes off.</p><p>But the point is, she was lying next to him in bed. Her face beside his \u2013 in bed.</p> <p>Her in bed with Jake. That\u2019s all I need to know, to tell me everything I already knew.</p><p>Also there is one of her sat on Jake\u2019s lap in what is apparently the hotel bar. You know the one he was sat pining over me in, waiting for me in after our fight, yeah that bar.</p><p>So details of my life, the life I shared with Jake, and his betrayal have been splashed all over the news for the world to see.</p><p>My pain is up for public consumption. And it\u2019s the worst kind of torture.</p><p>I\u2019m not a public person. Of course I knew what being with Jake entailed, I just never foresaw this. And now I know, with absolute certainty I\u2019m not cut out for the type of life he leads. His life belongs to the whole world. I don\u2019t want that for myself.</p> <p>Maybe Kaitlyn Bitch did me a favour. Because at least I now know what life with Jake really consists of. It\u2019s best I get out now, early on, before I got in too deep.</p><p>Well that\u2019s what I\u2019m telling myself anyway. My heart is telling me I was already in way too deep to begin with.</p><p>So for five days I\u2019ve been hiding at my folks, letting my dad deal with the press at the door and on the phone, and the paps hanging around outside waiting to get a picture of me.</p><p>I hate to bring it to their doorstep, but I just couldn\u2019t go back to my flat \u2013 that would have meant dealing with it alone. I know I have Simone there, but it wouldn\u2019t have been fair to pull her into this, especially not when she\u2019s with Denny. That already ties her up in it enough as it is.</p><p>So I\u2019m letting my dad kick paparazzi butt, while I hide in the house, working on my column to keep busy.</p><p>My mum and dad have been great these last five days. I couldn\u2019t have coped without them, well not that I\u2019m actually coping in any way ... more coasting.</p> <p>My mum has even managed to refrain from an \u2018I told you so\u2019 about Jake, and my dad ... well, he hasn\u2019t said it outright to me, but I think he believes Jake is telling the truth about Kaitlyn Bitch. And my dad thinking that Jake is telling the truth makes me wobble a little if I\u2019m being totally honest.</p><p>But what\u2019s making me falter just that little bit more is the whole \u2018they\u2019ve been having an affair\u2019 story. Because honestly, a story is what I believe that to be.</p><p>She\u2019s lied for sure about some of the times she said she was with Jake. They just aren\u2019t possible, because he was with me.</p><p>One of them was when everyone still thought Jake was in LA, but he wasn\u2019t, he was in London with me. It was straight after his dad died and he got the jet over here to be with me. Because he needed me.</p><p>Kaitlyn Bitch is claiming to the press they spent the night together in a hotel in LA, that he flew her in. She even has her friend backing her up, saying she was with Kaitlyn Bitch when he called.</p><p>I could go public and out it as a lie, but I don\u2019t want to be pulled into the press any more than I am being, and really, what\u2019s the point. Ultimately it doesn\u2019t erase the fact that I caught him in bed with her. So whether they were having a full blown affair, or it was just a one nighter that she\u2019s embellishing for the press, it\u2019s irrelevant.</p><p>He betrayed me.</p><p>Apparently, Jake is suing the paper that ran the story, the one which bought the rights to it.</p> <p>Simone told me. Denny told her.</p><p>Really I don\u2019t care what Jake does.</p><p>I\u2019m done with it all. I\u2019m done with him.</p><p>I just want to get his little game called New York over and done with, so I can move on with my life.</p><p>\u201cI can do this, Vicky,\u201d I infer, not really sure if I\u2019m trying to convince her or myself in this moment. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019m done with Jake. I\u2019ll go to New York, cover the show, then come straight home, and I\u2019ll finally be free of it all.\u201d</p><p>Free of him. Well, once the bio\u2019s done that is.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to come to with you? Moral support, and also I can kick his ass for you if you want.\u201d</p><p>I smile at the sentiment. \u201cThanks for the offer, but if anyone were to be kicking Jake\u2019s ass it\u2019d be me. You\u2019ve got enough on at the magazine at the moment. I\u2019ll be fine. Just in and out for the show. I\u2019ll arrange my flights so I\u2019m there for a day max. Do my job, and then straight back home.\u201d</p><p>I hear her exhale down the line. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be that easy, sweetheart. This is Jake we\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I\u2019ve had time away from him, and I\u2019m feeling stronger now. I\u2019m not going back to him, no matter what games he plays. I\u2019ll do my job, and then he\u2019s out of my life for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTru ... look, this is just me playing devil\u2019s advocate here, as your friend ... but have you considered the possibility that maybe Jake is telling the truth. I know you found him in bed with that trampy girl, but he\u2019s been so adamant about it, and her selling her story to the press about the whole torrid affair thing, and him suing them all, big guns, it just makes you think a little, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve considered it,\u201d I concede.</p><p>Minutes ago in fact. And every other single minute of the day before that.</p><p>\u201cBut I just...\u201d I sigh rubbing my face. \u201cI just don\u2019t know anything anymore Vicky, except for the fact that I found him in bed with her.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t shut my eyes without fear of seeing it on playback.</p><p>\u201cBut sometimes the picture doesn\u2019t show the true facts \u2013 you know.\u201d I can mentally feel her nudging me. \u201cMaybe you should talk to him. Listen to what he has to say. He\u2019s obviously desperate to see you, my darling, and he\u2019s struggling, that\u2019s plain for everyone to see.\u201d</p><p>Jake wasn\u2019t going to do the show at TD Garden after I left him, but somehow the guys got him on stage.</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen the show, this is all what I\u2019m hearing from Simone when I\u2019ve talked to her on the phone, not that I asked for any details, but she felt the need to share, and she\u2019s getting her feed direct from Denny, so I\u2019m taking it as read.</p><p>But from what Simone said, Jake literally went on stage, sang straight through, number after number, no Jake banter, no nothing. He finished the set, walked off stage, giving no encore and got Dave to take him straight back to the hotel. That\u2019s pretty much how the last few shows since have been as well.</p><p>And the worst thing about it is some of his fans are blaming his behaviour on me for leaving him. Can you fucking believe it! Some are blaming the skank I found in his bed too. But even so, it\u2019s just more crap to add to the pile. Another sharp prod to remind me of why I could never be with Jake again.</p><p>Also, Simone told me Jake\u2019s clean.</p><p>She said he hasn\u2019t used since I left. Apparently he got in touch with his sponsor. He isn\u2019t going back to rehab, he\u2019s doing it with the support of his sponsor and drug counsellors, so at least one good thing has come out of this whole continuing nightmare.</p><p>I\u2019m glad he\u2019s clean. More than glad, I\u2019m relieved. I might be pissed at Jake, but I don\u2019t want him hurting himself on that rubbish.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, talking to Jake about any of it is the last thing I want to do right now,\u201d I say to Vicky. \u201cThe extent of my vocab with him will be about the tour and nothing more. I just want to go to New York, cover the show and then come back to London and get straight back to work. I just need to get back to normal \u2013 you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, and I\u2019ll support you however I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so let\u2019s get this New York ball rolling, the quicker it's done, the quicker you\u2019re out \u2013 right? So do you want me to call Stuart and let him know you\u2019re going, or do you want to call him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call him,\u201d I reply without hesitation.</p><p>I haven\u2019t spoken to Stuart since I left. I miss him tons.</p><p>\u201cDo you have his number there, Vicky?\u201d I don\u2019t have anyone\u2019s numbers. They were all stored on my phone. The phone Jake broke.</p><p>I haven\u2019t got a replacement yet. There hasn't been an opportunity to do so, and there\u2019s no real point in having one at the moment. I\u2019d only get calls I don\u2019t want to receive. I do miss hearing Adele though.</p><p>Vicky gives me Stuart\u2019s number, and I hang up from her.</p><p>I feel nervous calling Stuart. Calling him is the closest thing to calling Jake.</p><p>\u201cStuart Benson?\u201d His lovely warm voice comes down the line and I feel my lip instantly wobble.</p><p>\u201cStuart, hi, it\u2019s Tru.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...um...hi.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so that\u2019s not the response I was hoping for. I guess he hasn\u2019t missed me like I\u2019ve missed him. And there was me thinking we were good friends. I\u2019m so crap at judging people.</p><p>\u201cI was just calling to, uh ... let you know that I\u2019ll be coming to cover the show in New York.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Is he mad at me or something?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d he finally says.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t sound like he thinks it\u2019s great.</p><p>\u201cStuart, is everything okay? Are you angry with me or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not gorgeous.\u201d Well that sounded the most Stuart-like sentence I\u2019ve heard this whole phone conversation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just something,\u201d he adds, emphasising on the \u2018something\u2019 and my brain clicks in.</p><p>\u201cJake\u2019s there with you isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m in the car, with \u2013 something and I figured, you wouldn\u2019t want \u2013 you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck are you being so cryptic with?\u201d I hear Jake\u2019s voice loud and clear in the background.</p><p>My heart starts to hurt just hearing his voice.</p><p>Oh God. I miss him so much.</p><p>No I don\u2019t. I hate him.</p><p>I think.</p><p>I don\u2019t know.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>Look at me. I hear his voice, and my head turns to mush. How the hell am I going to manage going to New York and seeing him for a whole day.</p><p>No, I\u2019ll be fine. I can do it for Vicky and the magazine. That\u2019s all that matters.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking with my boyfriend,\u201d Stuart says to him. \u201cMind your own fuckin\u2019 business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when have you got a boyfriend?\u201d I can almost hear the pause and Jake\u2019s mind working, and I just know what\u2019s coming next. \u201cIs that Tru on the phone?\u201d</p><p>My heart stops dead in my chest.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stuart says to him. \u201cI\u2019m gonna have to go lover,\u201d he says down the line to me, \u201cmy ass of a boss won\u2019t let me \u2013 Jesus Christ, Jake! What the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d I hear the tussle, and Stuart\u2019s voice fading away, as Jake wrestles the phone from off him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Any second now I\u2019m going to hear his voice.</p><p>I want to hang up. No I don\u2019t.</p><p>My hand is clamped around the phone, suddenly slick with sweat.</p><p>\u201cTru is that you?\u201d Jake\u2019s deep voice comes breathy down the line.</p> <p>My chest tightens. I can\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cIt is you isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s why you\u2019re not saying anything.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath, and exhale, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTru, oh God, baby, I miss you so much,\u201d his words come out in a flurry and I can hear the relief in his voice. \u201cPlease let me see you. I need to talk to you. I\u2019m so sorry for everything. Please just let me see you.\u201d His voice starts to break down the line.</p><p>Tears fill my eyes.</p> <p>I force them back with blinks, and then I steel myself to speak. \u201cI\u2019m coming to New York in a few days to cover the show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are? Oh thank god. Thank you, baby. You won\u2019t regret this, we can talk and sort all of this out and\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo Jake. We\u2019re not sorting anything out, because there\u2019s nothing to sort out. I\u2019m coming to cover the show because you\u2019re forcing me to. Anything else, you and I, we\u2019re done. For good. There\u2019s nothing to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTru, no, please.\u201d</p><p>My heart feels so heavy in my chest it\u2019s practically labouring into my stomach.</p><p>I force a strength which I don\u2019t own right now, and maybe never will again, and taking a deep breath, I say, \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, forcing me to come to New York like this so you can try and feed me your bullshit lies. Using Vicky and the magazine to get to me. It\u2019s low Jake, even for you. And if you thought for one moment this would give you the chance to fix things, somehow make me care for you again, then you\u2019re sadly mistaken. All you are doing is making it easier for me to hate you more than I already do.\u201d Another deep breath. \u201cPlease ask Stuart to email the flight and accommodation details to me. Goodbye, Jake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTru, no! Wait! You\u2019ve got it all wrong! Just talk to me, hear me out on this, please.\u201d</p><p>I still for a minute.</p><p>I\u2019m wobbling again. I close my eyes and see the image of him in bed with her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I hang the phone up on him.</p><p>Dropping it to the floor, I start sobbing into my hands.</p><p>We land in at JFK at 10pm. Simone is with me. I was going to come alone as I\u2019m only doing a short stop over. But Simone didn\u2019t want me to come alone. She was insistent. And she said she was going to come and see Denny soon anyway, so she was killing two birds.</p><p>Dave\u2019s in the airport waiting for us.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Tru,\u201d he smiles down at me.</p><p>\u201cHi, Dave.\u201d I reach up on my tiptoes and kiss his cheek.</p><p>He looks at me surprised, and I see a little flush rise in his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d I say to him. It\u2019s true I have. I\u2019ve missed all of them.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ve all missed you here too.\u201d I get the distinct impression he\u2019s referring to Jake in that sentiment.</p><p>\u201cHi, Simone,\u201d he says taking both our cases from us. \u201cThe car\u2019s just up front.\u201d</p><p>Threading my arm through Simone\u2019s we follow Dave out to the car.</p><p>Denny is in the car waiting for us \u2013 well Simone, not me obviously. And she\u2019s a little more than overjoyed to see him.</p><p>It makes me hurt.</p><p>I\u2019m happy for her of course, but it just reminds me of the time I landed in Stockholm and Jake was waiting in the car for me. The day we swapped our friendship bracelets.</p><p>I touch it on my wrist. I haven\u2019t been able to take it off yet. I\u2019m still wearing the Tiffany necklace too.</p><p>I will take them both off, soon, I\u2019m just not ready to yet.</p><p>A little part of me wondered if Jake would be waiting in the car for me, and I hate that I felt such a strong smart of disappointment that he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>He hasn\u2019t tried to make any form of contact with me in the last few days. No flowers. No letters. He\u2019s been completely quiet.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019s finally got the message after I told him on the phone.</p><p>Good, I\u2019m glad.</p><p>I think.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>I sit up front with Dave, to give the lovebirds a little time to themselves in the back, on the ride to the hotel, and I chat with him about everything from the weather to sports, making sure to avoid any conversation that could lead to Jake.</p><p>We\u2019re staying at the Mandarin Oriental. Dave parks up in the hotel car park, and insists on taking my case up to my suite for me. Denny\u2019s all set with Simone\u2019s. He\u2019s so sweet to her.</p><p>Denny and Simone are staying on the 52nd floor, so they get out of the lift first. I\u2019m on the 53rd.</p><p>Simone hugs me goodbye as she\u2019s getting out of the lift.</p><p>\u201cWill you be okay?\u201d she says into my ear. \u201cI can stay with you if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I say releasing myself from her embrace. \u201cGo have fun with Denny and I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>She reluctantly backs out of the lift. \u201cYou know where I am if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, now go ... night, Denny.\u201d I smile at him.</p><p>\u201cSee you later, Tru.\u201d</p><p>Dave lets go of the hold button, and I wave to Simone as the doors close.</p><p>We go up one more floor, and then we\u2019re at mine.</p><p>Dave wheels my case along the hall for me.</p><p>\u201cThis is you,\u201d he says, stopping outside the double door marked Presidential Suite.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>He puts the key card in and pushes open one of the doors for me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying in here?\u201d I give him a confused look.</p><p>Dave nods, and hands me the key card.</p><p>\u201cAlone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Tru,\u201d he chuckles.</p><p>I know I\u2019ve stayed in these kinds of suites before, but the Presidential Suite is generally the best suite the hotel has to offer. It\u2019s always the one Jake stays in.</p><p>\u201cBut ... this is too much for just me,\u201d I mumble, poking my head in through the door.</p><p>I gasp.</p><p>It\u2019s bloody massive. Bigger than any I\u2019ve ever stayed in with Jake before.</p><p>I look back at Dave, wide eyed.</p><p>He shrugs, smiling. \u201cStuart books the rooms.\u201d</p><p>On Jake\u2019s orders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to thank him, a lot,\u201d I mutter, taking my case from Dave. \u201cThanks for picking me up from the airport.\u201d I smile up at him.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I guess I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d he smiles. \u201cGoodnight Tru.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d I reply.</p><p>Dave backs up and starts to walk down the hall, then he stops a few feet away and turns to look at me.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not my place, and I don\u2019t mean to speak out of turn, but for what it\u2019s worth, I don\u2019t believe what that girl\u2019s claiming. I\u2019ve worked for Jake for a long time and I\u2019ve seen a lot, and I also have a knack for knowing when people are lying \u2013 something I learned in my years as a marine, and in my opinion Jake\u2019s telling the truth.\u201d He presses his lips together giving me one last small smile, then turns and walks away.</p><p>I close the door behind me and lean up against it.</p><p>Everyone believes Jake. I think even Simone does to be quite honest, but she hasn\u2019t said. So it seems it is only me who doesn\u2019t believe him. But then I was the one who found him in bed with her.</p><p>And Dave was a marine? How did I not even know that?</p><p>But still, don\u2019t digress and don\u2019t waiver Tru. Trust your own judgement. You know what you saw.</p><p>Jake\u2019s a womaniser. Everyone knows that. It\u2019s who he is, so why in the world would he ever change for you.</p><p>Pulling my case through the suite, I park it up in the humongous bedroom, and that\u2019s when I see a light blue gift box sitting on the equally humongous bed.</p><p>Jake.</p><p>I go over and sit on the edge of the bed beside it. Tentatively I lift the lid off the box.</p><p>Inside is a brand new iPhone. There\u2019s also a little card in the box. I open it and read:</p><p>This is to replace the one I broke. It\u2019s registered to your old number. I set it up for you with your ring tone.</p><p>J. x</p><p>With trembling fingers I pick the phone up, dropping the card back into the box.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe he bought me a brand new iPhone \u2013 no, actually I can, this is Jake we\u2019re talking about.</p><p>Well I\u2019m not keeping it. He can\u2019t buy me back with fancy gadgets.</p><p>It is pretty though.</p><p>I might just turn it on, see what it\u2019s like, you know, in case I decide to buy myself one after I\u2019ve given him this one back.</p><p>I switch it on and the screen lights up. I wait while it loads.</p><p>The screen saver comes into focus behind the icons. It\u2019s a picture of Lumb Falls.</p><p>Tears instantly fill my eyes from the barrage of memories it brings.</p><p>Is he trying to hurt me?</p><p>I press the music icon, ridding the picture from the screen, and see just one song sitting in there. Adele. My ring tone.</p><p>Selecting the song to play, I sit and listen as Adele starts to sing, acapella from my phone.</p><p>I\u2019ve never heard this version before. I wonder where he got it?</p><p>Over Adele\u2019s singing, I hear a light knock on the main door.</p><p>It\u2019s probably Simone coming to check on me. She\u2019s such a worrier.</p><p>I wander from the bedroom, phone in hand with Adele still singing, through the living room, and I swing the door open.</p><p>Jake.</p><p>My heart stops.</p><p>He looks beautiful, so very beautiful. He\u2019s unshaven, his eyes dark, tired, but he is still so absolutely, breathtakingly beautiful.</p><p>It makes my chest hurt.</p><p>His scent permeates the air. His special Jake scent. My insides start to ache, and my fingers itch with absolute desperation to touch him.</p><p>All of my anger toward him dissipates. All the things I wanted to say, thought I would say to him \u2013 gone.</p><p>I\u2019m rendered powerless by his presence.</p><p>I clutch my hand around the still singing phone.</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d He looks down at the phone in my hand.</p><p>My eyes follow his. \u201cI-I did. Yes, thank you \u2013 you didn\u2019t have to buy me this though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes I did.\u201d He looks up, straight into my eyes.</p><p>My legs start to tremble.</p><p>\u201cYou like the song?\u201d he asks, blinking me free.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you. It\u2019s amazing. I love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be happy to hear that.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m confused, and a little suspicious. \u201cWhere did you get the song?\u201d</p><p>He pushes his hand through his hair and hangs it off the back of his neck; I see the muscles in his arms tense. It makes me want to touch him even more.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours. She recorded it to the phone as a favour for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Holy fuck. He got me my very own acapella recorded ring tone. I am the only person in the world to have to this version.</p><p>I have my very own special ring tone, because of him.</p><p>What was left of my heart has just been crushed to smithereens. I can feel tears thickening my throat.</p><p>He makes it so hard for me to hate him when he does ridiculously lovely shit like this for me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, don\u2019t weaken.

Adele stops singing in my hand, breaking it.</p><p>\u201cDid you want something or...?\u201d I pull nervously on the hem of my T-shirt, looking down away from his heavy stare.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, I uh ... I brought your things.\u201d He pulls a suitcase out just from behind the wall.</p> <p>My suitcase. The one I left in Boston. He\u2019s kept it with him this whole time.</p><p>To be honest I hadn\u2019t really thought about what he\u2019d done with it.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say taking it from him. My fingers graze his in the exchange.</p><p>Heat sears painfully up my arm, coursing through my body, careening straight for my heart.</p><p>I wheel the case in, parking it up by the side of the door, desperately trying to control my feelings.</p><p>\u201cSo...um.\u201d He brushes his hand through his hair again. \u201cDo you need anything or...?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>This is so hard. There\u2019s no witty Jake banter. The ease that has always been between us is gone. It\u2019s almost like we\u2019re strangers. He\u2019s not my Jake anymore, and it hurts beyond words.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He steps back. \u201cSo...I guess I\u2019ll see you \u2013 tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s leaving. A sinking feeling encompasses me. I don\u2019t want him to go.</p><p>Yes, I do.</p><p>Composing myself, I say, \u201cGoodnight, Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Trudy Bennett.\u201d He smiles at me ruefully.</p><p>As I start to close the door, he speaks again. \u201cTru?\u201d</p> <p>I open the door back up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really good to see you again. You look...well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I force a painful smile. \u201cYou too.\u201d</p><p>I close the door, shutting him out.</p><p>Leaning up against it, catching the breath I didn\u2019t know I was holding, I slide down, sinking to the floor, under the weight of the grief which is crushing me.</p><p>This is so much harder than I could have ever thought.</p><p>Taking a deep breath I attempt to steady my emotions.</p><p>It\u2019s just one day Tru, that\u2019s all. Get through tomorrow and the show, then your flight is booked for straight afterwards, and you\u2019re home free.</p><p>Or am I? Will I ever truly be free of Jake when he\u2019s already worked so deeply into my heart.</p><p>Adele starts to sing in my hand. Lifting it up, I see I have a text.</p><p>Jake:</p><p>When I said you looked well, what I really should have said was that you look beautiful. x</p><p>And there\u2019s my Jake.</p><p>Unstoppable tears trickle from my eyes, as I start to drown in memories of him. The feel of his skin against mine, his kiss, the way he made love to me.</p><p>I don\u2019t think I can do this. It\u2019s too hard being around him.</p><p>No, I can, it\u2019s just twenty-four hours. Twenty-four tiny hours to get through.</p><p>But even as I think it, fighting my internal battle, I don\u2019t feel so sure anymore. And then my tears turn into full on sobs, and I keep crying until all I\u2019m left with is dry heaves racking my body senseless.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Nine</p><p>After Jake left last night, and I\u2019d cried myself into a dried out puffy eyed state, I immersed myself in the humongous bath tub, staying in until the water went cold, thinking about Jake and what I was going to do.</p><p>After coming to no conclusion, leaving me exactly where I was before, I raided the minibar. I had a couple of glasses of wine in the hope they would help me sleep, and I climbed into the ginormous bed.</p><p>The wine didn\u2019t help me sleep as I had hoped, because sleeping in a bed like this without Jake, just felt wrong. Empty and so very lonely.</p><p>It just made me miss him even more than I already do.</p><p>All I could think was that he was here in the hotel somewhere. Somewhere close. And knowing I could pick my phone up and call him, and I would be laid in his arms within minutes made it all the more harder.</p><p>The anger I\u2019d been so desperately clinging to skipped out on me, leaving me with raw emotion.</p><p>I knew seeing Jake again would be hard, but I underestimated just how hard.</p><p>Seeing him stood there exposed me to my feelings in a blast, the ones I\u2019ve been so desperately trying to hide from this last week. I was forced to feel the complete and utter intensity of them, and it\u2019s been bleeding the hell out of me ever since.</p><p>So after spending the night listening to Cyndi Lauper\u2019s, \u2018Time After Time\u2019 on loop on my new iPhone, crying along with the lyrics, I finally cried myself to sleep for a few hours. And now I find myself at 6am sitting at a table in the hotel restaurant, drinking coffee just for the want of something to do.</p><p>I look a puffy eyed, tired mess, but I don\u2019t care.</p><p>As it\u2019s so early breakfast has only just started to be served, so I\u2019m alone in here with only the waiting staff for company. Exactly as I want it.</p><p>I nabbed a newspaper on the way in to read to keep my mind occupied. It\u2019s the New York Times, and I\u2019m reading the business pages avoiding anything remotely entertainment wise in case there is something about Jake in here.</p><p>Scanning my eyes over the text about the ever rising price of gasoline, I feel a presence beside me. Looking up I expect to see the waiter, but it\u2019s Jake.</p><p>My heart jumps up in my chest, straight out of my mouth and makes a bolt for the door.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says. His voice sounds rough and smooth like only his can. \u201cYou mind if I join you?\u201d</p><p>He smells strongly of cigarettes. He must have literally just had a smoke.</p><p>Swallowing my heart back down, I utter, \u201cUm, no, of course not.\u201d</p><p>Jake takes the seat opposite me at the table, and I\u2019m struggling to keep my eyes off him.</p><p>He looks like he hasn\u2019t had much sleep. His normally light eyes look dark, and his hair has that ruffled up look it gets when he\u2019s worried about something and has been driving his fingers repeatedly through it.</p><p>It makes me want to reach my hand out and smooth it down, and soothe him.</p><p>I press my palms flat to the table.</p><p>\u201cHave you already ordered?\u201d he indicates to my half-drunk coffee.</p><p>\u201cOnly the coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you eating?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, no, in response, resting my eyes back on the newspaper.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019ve lost weight.\u201d</p><p>My eyes snap up to his. \u201cAre you saying I was fat before?\u201d</p><p>Here she is, Tru who wants to pick a fight with Jake. I was wondering when she\u2019d show up. Apparently, at 6am in a hotel restaurant.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d He shakes his head, looking helpless. \u201cI was just ... trying to make conversation, I guess...\u201d he trails off.</p><p>\u201cWell don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>My eyes go back to the paper, desperately trying to focus on the text, but now all I can feel is my anger and rage heating in my blood, bubbling up, and I just want to yell at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to leave?\u201d he asks in a soft voice, tracing his fingertip over the table cloth.</p><p>And that\u2019s all he has to say and I\u2019m over the edge.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter what I want?!\u201d I hurl at him.</p><p>His brow furrows. \u201cOf course is does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo it doesn\u2019t! If it did then I wouldn\u2019t be here right now having this conversation with you. I\u2019d be home, getting on with my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTru...\u201d He reaches his hand across the table, trying to take mine, but I snatch it away before he gets chance.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d I give him the coldest look I can muster up. \u201cDid you just come down here to torture me some more \u2013 more than you already have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTorture you?\u201d He looks seriously pissed off at that statement.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I bang my hands on the table. \u201cTorturing me, forcing me to be around you after what you did!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it!\u201d I cry, getting to my feet.</p><p>My heart is pumping so fast, so hard, and blood is roaring in my ears. I start to walk away from the table, and him.</p><p>\u201cWILL YOU JUST STOP AND FUCKIN\u2019 LISTEN TO ME!\u201d he roars, standing so abruptly that his chair falls out behind him, banging to the floor.</p><p>I blanch.</p><p>His voice is so all-consuming that everything in the room stops moving.</p><p>Me. Time. Air. Everything.</p><p>Jake\u2019s chest is pumping up and down angrily, his T-shirt rising and falling with each breath.</p><p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen him so angry.</p><p>Momentarily stunned, I falter, but then I very quickly come back to life.</p><p>Turning on the spot, I state, \u201cNo, I won\u2019t bloody stop and listen to you because I\u2019m not interested in a damn thing you have to say!\u201d I curse the betrayal my voice does when it quivers slightly.</p><p>\u201cJesus fuckin\u2019 Christ woman!\u201d he growls. \u201cYou\u2019re so stubborn! And you will listen to me if I have to tie you to that fuckin\u2019 chair, to do so!\u201d He jabs a finger in the direction of the seat my ass just graced moments ago. \u201cAnd I will keep on saying this until you hear me \u2013 I did not have sex with that girl, and I most certainly did not have an affair with her! I fuckin\u2019 love you, Tru! More than life itself! I would never do that to you! Now are you hearing any of this yet?!\u201d He lifts his hands to his head in frustration. \u201cIs any of this getting through to your stubborn ass brain?!\u201d</p><p>He looks so angry and frustrated, and lost.</p><p>But then so am I.</p><p>I fold my arms across my chest. \u201cWords, Jake. That\u2019s all they are. I believe in facts, statistics and logic.\u201d I\u2019m throwing words at him, trying to confuse him, or maybe me, I\u2019m not sure, all I do know is right now I sound like Vicky.</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d he seethes, jaw clenched, brow furrowed.</p><p>\u201cI believe what I saw!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you believe what you think you saw!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me I didn\u2019t walk in on you in bed with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo then I saw right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYES!\u201d I wrap my hand around my ponytail, tugging on it hard, like the ache of that will take all of my anger and frustrations away.</p><p>\u201cNothing you can say or do will change my mind on this,\u201d I continue in a low, firm tone. \u201cI believe what I saw \u2013 now if you\u2019re quite done I\u2019m going back to my room.\u201d</p><p>I step back, but he stops me with his words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done.\u201d He sounds so authoritative, so angry, that I pale and I literally can\u2019t move.</p><p>He stalks around the table, coming close to me. His anger is radiating and it makes me want to step back, but I fight the urge.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t give up until you believe me, Tru,\u201d he says low, leaning into my face. \u201cI won\u2019t stop fighting for you \u2013 for us. I want you back and I will keep on trying, with whatever methods I can, until you believe that I\u2019m telling you the truth \u2013 that you forgive me for letting you down with the drugs, and that I have you back in my life again.\u201d</p><p>Giving me one last determined stare, he turns abruptly and stalks out of the restaurant, leaving me trembling to the core, and alone with the stares of the waiting staff who were just witness to our fight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wrapping my arms around my chest, my face burning, I bite back tears, and on unsteady feet I quickly leave the restaurant heading straight for my room.</p><p>I\u2019m shopping in Macy\u2019s with Simone. Well Simone\u2019s shopping, and I\u2019m just trailing around behind her.</p><p>She found out about my fight with Jake and ordered that we were going out this afternoon shopping.</p><p>Even though I wasn\u2019t in the mood, and would have been quite happy to hide in my suite until I had to show my face at the show tonight, I could tell Simone meant business. I\u2019d pretty much lost any fight I had in me earlier from my fight with Jake, so I yielded.</p> <p>I\u2019m still reeling from it to be honest.</p><p>He\u2019s not going to let me go. He\u2019s never going to give up on us.</p><p>Yeah, well good luck with that buddy, because the more you push the further I\u2019m going to pull away.</p><p>I think.</p><p>I don\u2019t know.</p> <p>Crap.</p><p>Jake has this innate way of being able to pull and tie up my strings like no one before, and when I\u2019m around him I just seem to lose all sense and focus. And maybe a teeny tiny part of me wants to go back. But a bigger part of me \u2013 the humiliated, betrayed part of me doesn\u2019t.</p><p>And for now, humiliated Tru is in control.</p><p>Simone is loaded up with clothes she potentially wants to buy. I\u2019m so far gone into my own wallowing I can\u2019t even begin to appreciate the pretty things surrounding me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to try this stuff on. Keep me company?\u201d Simone asks.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve got anything better to do.</p> <p>I follow Simone into the empty changing rooms and take a seat while she goes into the cubical to try clothes on.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asks, coming out of the cubicle in a beautiful, fuchsia pink Miss Sixty dress a few minutes later.</p><p>My pretty-dress-spidey-sense finally shows up, and I\u2019m instantly in love.</p><p>It\u2019s sleeveless, high belted; which is studded, has a low hem and a scoop neck, with a raw-edged detail across the chest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous,\u201d I murmur, wishing I\u2019d been paying attention before now as I would have picked it up for myself. At least I know Simone will lend it to me if I want to wear it. Not that I feel like going out much nowadays.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d team it with those patent blue heels you\u2019ve got there.\u201d I nod in the direction of the pretty high-heeled shoes sitting on the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d She pushes her brows together. \u201cI brought them in to try on with the black dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d I say. \u201cPut them on and you\u2019ll see.\u201d</p> <p>Shrugging, she slips her feet into the insanely high heels and looks at herself in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cWow! You\u2019re right,\u201d she grins. \u201cThey do work together. Only problem is this outfit is on the wrong girl. No way could I pull this off, I\u2019m too pale. This has you written all over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, it suits you just right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry it on,\u201d she encourages.</p><p>Even though I love the outfit, I\u2019m just not in the mood to play dress up. I can\u2019t get my mood past Jake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the mood to try clothes on.\u201d I start to chew on my thumbnail.</p><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t try, just buy. We\u2019re about the same size,\u201d she says, assessing herself in the mirror again.</p><p>I snort. It\u2019s not the most attractive sound.</p><p>\u201cWe are!\u201d She sounds defensive.</p><p>\u201cYeah, except for that my ass is about ten times as big as yours is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s not.\u201d She gives me a disapproving look. \u201cI guarantee this dress will fit you, so I\u2019m telling you that you are getting this dress and shoes if I have to pay for them myself. And you\u2019re wearing them to the show tonight as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell I am!\u201d I say my head snapping up. \u201cI\u2019m going to the show in my jeans and a T-shirt, comfortable flight clothes. I\u2019m catching my flight straight after remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can change at the airport. You are going to that show looking your best, Tru.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to party, I\u2019m working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t people generally dress nice for work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrash collectors don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnock it off, Tru.\u201d She comes over and sits beside me, in my soon to be owned outfit.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurting right now.\u201d Her voice is soft, careful. \u201cAs to be expected. And the best way to help that hurt is to try to feel good about yourself. Put on a beautiful dress and a pair of killer heels, and yes, you may still feel crap on the inside, but on the outside you\u2019ll look knock out, and that will be the one thing that will keep the smile plastered on your face for the night.\u201d She nudges me with her shoulder, smiling.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I huff. \u201cI\u2019ll wear the stupid dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. And while I\u2019m in an advice giving mood, can I give you another piece of advice?\u201d</p><p>I turn my head, looking straight at her. \u201cIf it\u2019s about Jake, then no.\u201d</p><p>She gives me a no-nonsense look. \u201cTalk to him, Tru. I\u2019ve kept my opinion to myself on this, and I\u2019ve done the supportive best friend bit, but now I\u2019m telling you how it is \u2013 blanking Jake like this is no good for either of you.\u201d She puts her hand on my forearm. \u201cAnd you can blast me for it all you want, but ... I believe him. I think he\u2019s telling the truth. I don\u2019t believe he had sex with that tramp. I think she\u2019s just a gold-digging opportunistic little whore. And honestly, I can\u2019t even begin to imagine how painful it was walking in and seeing him in bed with her like that ... and yes, he absolutely let you down with the drugs,\u201d she quickly adds, when I open my mouth to speak. \u201cBut you can\u2019t go on like this. You need to talk to him. And honestly,\u201d she sighs. \u201cI think you know all of this too, but for some reason I can\u2019t fathom, you won\u2019t let him in to fix things. And it\u2019s just not like you to be so unforgiving, Tru.\u201d</p><p>I scruff the toe of my boot against the carpet. She\u2019s skirting so close to the truth right now. Closer than I want.</p><p>\u201cJake loves you, that is more than clear to see,\u201d she goes on, \u201cand I know you love him too. So you just need to talk to him and figure out a fix for the both of you.\u201d</p><p>And because she\u2019s so close to the truth I get angry.</p><p>I get to my feet, feeling a little more than vexed. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be on my side here, Simone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am on your side.\u201d She stands too, facing me. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying this. I hate seeing you hurting so badly when it can be so easily fixed. If you just talk to him, listen to what he has to say...\u201d She puts her hands on my upper arms. \u201cHonestly, babe, if I thought for one minute that he\u2019d done the deed with the that little tramp, then I\u2019d be winging your corner and kicking his ass to Hell and back ... but I honestly don\u2019t think he has,\u201d she\u2019s shaking her head. \u201cHe\u2019s made mistakes, some big whooping ones, but not that one.\u201d</p><p>Tears are welling in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to upset you, honey.\u201d She takes me into her arms, hugging me. \u201cIt just really needed saying.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut, fighting the tears back. \u201cI just can\u2019t get that image of him in bed with her out of my head.\u201d I bang my palm against forehead. \u201cAnd honestly...\u201d I bite my lip, cursing myself for finally saying this. \u201cI just ... well I just don\u2019t think I\u2019m cut out for all of this. I\u2019m not cut out for his lifestyle \u2013 everything that comes with him.\u201d</p><p>Leaning back, she looks at my face. \u201cThat\u2019s what this is all about isn\u2019t it? Why you\u2019ve shutdown on him completely.\u201d</p><p>I brush a stray tear away. \u201cAt first, I honestly believed he had cheated with her after catching them like that. But as time's gone on...\u201d I sigh. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think he has cheated, but her selling her story and all the attention it\u2019s brought to me ... well it just made me realise what my fears were all along about being with Jake.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve known this for a while, but I\u2019ve just been covering it with the whole cheating thing. It went way beyond Kaitlyn Bitch the instant the press set up camp on my parents\u2019 doorstep.</p><p>\u201cWhich are?\u201d she pushes.</p><p>\u201cWho he is. Everything that comes with him. There\u2019s just no privacy, Simone. We can barely even go out on a date without someone there taking his picture, wanting his autograph, wanting a piece of him. It doesn\u2019t feel like there is just ever me and him \u2013 that he\u2019ll ever fully be mine \u2013 and yes I know how selfish that sounds. But I just want a normal life. A private life. I don\u2019t want a life where every time I have a fight with my boyfriend, or we go on a date together, that it will be splashed all over the internet the very next day for people\u2019s breakfast reading.\u201d</p><p>The truth is there\u2019s only ever been one time where I\u2019ve felt like our relationship truly belonged to just me and Jake, and that was our night at Lumb Falls.</p><p>\u201cSo talk to him, tell him this,\u201d Simone urges, gently.</p><p>I shake my head, no.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a stubborn ass, Trudy Bennett. Give the guy a fighting chance, seriously, because currently he\u2019s all broken up and hurting over something he didn\u2019t do, desperate to reach you and let you know that. But currently he\u2019s fighting out of the wrong corner. It\u2019s not fair to him, Tru, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve been mulling over what Simone said for hours.</p><p>She\u2019s right, and I know it. I should tell Jake that I believe him over the girl, and what my real fears are about being with him.</p><p>But I can\u2019t.</p><p>Because if I do he\u2019ll talk me back into his life, and right now that just isn\u2019t what I want.</p><p>Well, I think it isn\u2019t.</p><p>I\u2019m standing backstage at Madison Square Garden with Simone. The support band is playing. They\u2019re pretty good. Really good in fact.</p><p>They\u2019re a local band who won a competition through a radio station to support TMS here at their show in New York.</p><p>It was Jake\u2019s idea to put the contest out. No one knows that, except for me and Stuart. Jake credited it as the bands idea.</p><p>He has such a good heart. I wish he would show it to more people than just me.</p><p>Ben drove Simone and I here from the hotel. I\u2019ve got my luggage in the car. Ben is going to take me straight to the airport after the show. All I have to do is let him know when I\u2019m ready to leave. Simone is staying on in New York to spend a few days with Denny.</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen or spoken to Jake since this morning, which is a good thing. I think.</p><p>I don\u2019t know.</p><p>I don\u2019t know anything anymore.</p><p>Spotting us, Denny comes over, eyes firmly pinned on Simone. I\u2019m so happy they found each other. One good thing to come out of me and Jake, I guess.</p><p>I drift off to the side giving them some space. I hate being the third wheel at the best of times. At the worst of times, even more so.</p><p>Just knowing Jake is around here somewhere is driving me nuts. I\u2019m on constant high-alert for any sign of him.</p><p>So far, nothing yet. I\u2019m wondering if he\u2019s avoiding me after our fight this morning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m wearing the pink dress and ridiculously pretty blue heels that Simone forced me to buy earlier, and I\u2019m already regretting the shoes, my feet are bloody killing me. Why don\u2019t I ever learn that pretty does not equal comfy.</p><p>I prop my butt up against the wall and bend over, slipping my foot out of the shoe, I rub my sore instep with my hand.</p><p>When I glance up I see a pair of black Converses approaching me.</p><p>Eyes up to the black jeans, reaching the sleeveless, vintage \u201994 Nine Inch Nails \u2018Downwards Spiral\u2019 T-shirt, with a guitar strapped pressed tight across it, the instantly recognisable tattoos on full show, to finally meet with Jake\u2019s face.</p> <p>He looks amazing. Beautiful. Just like the rock star he is. And was always meant to be.</p><p>I slip my foot back into my shoe. Nerves instantly encompass me, encapsulating me.</p><p>\u201cYou should learn to wear sensible shoes.\u201d He nods down at my feet.</p><p>\u201cI should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen again, if you did, I\u2019d have never have got to carry you into the hotel that night.\u201d His tone is low, intimate, and his eyes meet mine intensely.</p> <p>Nerve endings fire sparks out into my body, causing an intense rush of want and need for him.</p><p>Looking down, I break our stare.</p><p>\u201cSo ... uh ... Denny said you\u2019re leaving straight after the show.\u201d He takes another step closer to me.</p><p>We\u2019re only a foot apart now. I want to reach out and touch him more than anything. But I can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I tuck my hair behind my ear. \u201cSorry I can\u2019t make the after show party. I have to get back home \u2013 work you know \u2013 and my flights booked so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, yeah, of course, I understand.\u201d He pushes his hand through this hair.</p> <p>I meet his eyes, and I can see the blatant disharmony in them.</p><p>\u201cSo will I see you after the show? Before you leave,\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s a lie. I won\u2019t be here when he comes off stage. I\u2019m going to leave during the encore. Everyone\u2019s at their highest at that point, so I\u2019ll be able to slip away without being noticed.</p><p>I said goodbye to Jake once. Twice is just too much.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so I\u2019ll see you after the show then,\u201d he smiles, his mood seemingly picking up.</p><p>\u201cYeah ... looks like you\u2019re up.\u201d I nod in the direction of the roadie who is waiting to hook his guitar up.</p><p>Jake gives me a rueful smile. It almost breaks me on the spot.</p> <p>Reluctantly, he turns to go.</p><p>\u201cJake?\u201d</p><p>Stopping, he turns back, slipping his guitar around to the front.</p><p>\u201cHave a great show,\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cI will ... and Tru.\u201d He takes a step forward, back to me. \u201cYou look beautiful in those shoes ... and that dress, but then you look beautiful in anything.\u201d</p><p>Then he\u2019s gone, readying himself to perform to his adoring New York fans, unknowingly taking my heart with him.</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>Jake is performing better than his last few shows, maybe that\u2019s because I\u2019m here, or maybe it\u2019s because New York was his home for a time. I\u2019m not sure. But because he\u2019s better, the guys are better and the band as a whole is on fire, and the crowd sure are feeling it.</p><p>I\u2019m happy for him, for all of them that this tour is going out on a high, and I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m here to see it.</p><p>It\u2019s nearly two hours into the show and I know it\u2019s soon coming to an end. Which means it\u2019s almost time for me to go.</p><p>A part of me is struggling with the decision. A big part.</p><p>Simone and I are standing off stage in the left wing with Stuart so we have clear view of the guys, but all I\u2019m looking at is Jake.</p><p>It\u2019s all I\u2019ve done for the whole show. It\u2019s impossible not to.</p><p>But he hasn\u2019t once looked, or even glanced in my direction.</p><p>Whether that\u2019s a deliberate thing or he\u2019s just so caught up in the show, I\u2019m not sure.</p><p>Stuart beside me, puts his hand to his jacket pocket, feeling for his phone. He pulls it out, glances at the screen and taking the call, puts his finger in his ear and disappears off stage.</p><p>With Stuart gone, I move closer to Simone, linking my arm through hers, to continue watching the show.</p><p>I glance at her face. She\u2019s all bright eyed watching Denny on stage.</p><p>I feel a pang of pure envy. I wish Jake and I were still like they are.</p><p>A minute later I feel a hand tap me on the shoulder. I turn and see it\u2019s Stuart. He jerks his head to the side, signalling for me to follow him.</p><p>I slip my arm from Simone\u2019s and follow him off stage and down the steps.</p><p>Stuart leads me down a corridor where it\u2019s quiet. He does a quick look around making sure we\u2019re alone. \u201cI just got a call advising me that the girl, Kaitlyn, will be officially withdrawing her story about Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d I\u2019m surprised. No scrap that, I\u2019m stunned.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s admitting she lied about sleeping with Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why would she all of a sudden do that?\u201d I give him a suspicious look.</p><p>Stuart shrugs.</p><p>My spidey sense kicks in. \u201cStuart, do you have something to do with this?\u201d</p><p>He purses his lips. I can see considering in his eyes, which immediately tells me he did.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he utters.</p><p>I smile at him, shaking my head, relief filling me. Even though I figured Jake was telling the truth, to hear it from Stuart, well from the horse\u2019s mouth, is such a weight off my mind knowing Jake has been telling the truth all along.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get her to fess up?\u201d I question him.</p><p>He grins. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I can be very persuasive when I want to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuart...?\u201d I press.</p><p>Letting out a breath, he says, \u201cI went to see Kaitlyn at her home. Jake doesn\u2019t know this, and don\u2019t you tell him either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she agreed to see you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I turned up on her doorstep under the guise of been a reporter. Once I was in her house I told her who I really was, and there wasn\u2019t much she could do about it then. She wasn\u2019t happy, but I wasn\u2019t going anywhere until she listened to what I had to say. She needed to hear what this was doing to Jake ... to both of you.\u201d</p><p>My chest starts to feel tight at the memory of this last week. Of Jake being in pain.</p><p>\u201cAnd she listened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She might be money hungry, Tru, but she\u2019s not a bad person. And that\u2019s what it was all about \u2013 money. She\u2019s desperate for cash. The reason ... well, she has asked me to keep private, and I can\u2019t break that promise. But that night with Jake, she saw an opportunity and she took it. Knowing what I do, I figure I\u2019d have done the same. So I offered her what she needs in return for her to tell the truth. The deal was that she\u2019d retract her story, publically clearing Jake of any wrong doing. She said she needed time to think it over. I gave her my number and told her if she decided to do the right thing then to call me. That was her on the phone just then. She\u2019s going to issue a statement tomorrow telling the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s brave of her knowing the shit she\u2019s going to get from the public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s surprising what people will do for their children.\u201d I can tell the instant he says it, he knew he shouldn\u2019t have.</p><p>My eyebrows go up. \u201cShe has a kid? She only looked like a kid herself.\u201d</p><p>He sighs in on himself. \u201cShe\u2019s twenty. And an old twenty at that. Her kid is sick, really sick. The dad\u2019s not around. She has no family, and she needs money to pay the hospital bills.\u201d He glances around. \u201cI\u2019m telling you this because I know I can trust you.\u201d</p><p>I touch his arm. \u201cYou can.\u201d</p><p>And then it\u2019s suddenly very hard to hate her when I know she was only doing this for her sick kid.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do to help her?\u201d</p><p>He looks at me surprised. \u201cShe\u2019s made your life hell this last week, and you\u2019re asking if you can help her? You will never cease to amaze me, chica.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cMy mum and dad raised me to care for others in need, no matter the cost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s some good folks you have there. And thinking on that, there\u2019s someone out there who could do with a touch of your caring nature right now.\u201d He tilts his head in the direction of the hidden stage.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I sigh.</p><p>I want to help Jake, I really do. I want him to feel better, but I can\u2019t help him the way he wants. I can\u2019t live this lifestyle with him.</p><p>Swallowing back threatening tears, I say, \u201cI think Jake should know what you\u2019ve done to clear this up for him.\u201d</p><p>Stuart shakes his head, no. \u201cRight now Jake needs to believe there is good in people, and him finding out it was me sorting out another mess for him won\u2019t do that. Just leave him to believe she changed her mind and came clean.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, I see his reasoning.</p><p>\u201cHow are you going to pay Kaitlyn though? I\u2019m guessing she\u2019ll need a lot of money ... I have some I can give to help.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, gorgeous. I might be keeping it from Jake, but it doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not paying. He still fucked up big time with the drugs, and it was because of that he landed himself in this situation. The money\u2019s coming from him. I\u2019m just going to pass it off as a charity donation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you do that?\u201d I laugh.</p><p>\u201cSure I can ... because technically it is a charity donation.\u201d He winks.</p><p>\u201cWell, Jake might not be able to thank you for what you did, but I can.\u201d I wrap my arms around him, kissing his cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Jake would do without you, or me for that matter.\u201d Leaning back I look into his face. \u201cWe\u2019ll always be friends right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, chica.\u201d His brow furrows as he lets out a light sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting back together with him are you?\u201d</p><p>I step back, needing breathing space. Looking to the floor, I shake my head.</p><p>Knowing Jake hasn\u2019t cheated doesn\u2019t fix my real concerns about being with him.</p><p>\u201cWhatever reason you have, gorgeous, just know Jake loves you \u2013 a lot. So whatever it is \u2013 whatever the real problem is, talk to him about it, see if you can\u2019t work through it. The way I see it is you guys are meant to be together, and when it\u2019s a love like yours, then there shouldn\u2019t be anything you can work through.\u201d</p><p>Looking up, I meet his eyes. \u201cOkay,\u201d I nod. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go back, catch the last part of the show.\u201d</p><p>Stuart stares at me for a long moment, lips pressed together, assessing me.</p><p>He knows I\u2019m fobbing him off, but thankfully he leaves it there, and holds his arm out for me to take.</p><p>Linking my arm in through his, I walk back with Stuart to the stage.</p><p>I know my heart should feel light now knowing the truth, but it doesn\u2019t, if anything it feels heavier.</p><p>We get back to the side of the stage, joining Simone, just as the guys are finishing up. I look over at Jake on stage and all I feel is conflicted.</p><p>Suddenly the whole place darkens as the song comes to an end.</p><p>The encore is about to start in a few minutes. This is when I promised myself I would leave. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hear movement behind me. Turning, I see a roadie carrying a huge keyboard fixed to a stand, looking impatient for me to move. I nudge Stuart and Simone, and we all back out of his way, letting him pass by.</p><p>Denny and Smith come bounding off stage and over to us. They are pumped up, and covered in sweat.</p><p>I\u2019m guessing Jake went off stage with Tom to the right wing.</p><p>I see Simone beaming at Denny as he talks to her. I wish I was with Jake right now.</p> <p>No I don\u2019t.</p><p>The crowd\u2019s cheering and the guy\u2019s enthusiasm is infectious, as I listen to their quick talk, but my heart is dying a slow death in my chest, because even though I said to Stuart I would stay and talk to Jake, I know I can\u2019t.</p><p>If I do, he\u2019ll just talk me round, and I know I\u2019m not cut out for all of this.</p><p>The encore is readying to start, and the chants are growing louder and louder. The place is practically vibrating under my feet as the fans demand TMS back onto stage.</p><p>The place is insane, electric.</p> <p>You can literally feel the energy from the crowd, it\u2019s like a physical presence touching my skin.</p><p>Denny and Smith are called for and they disappear back on stage to take their places.</p><p>Then the spotlight hits illuminating Jake.</p><p>He\u2019s sitting on a stool, at the keyboard the roadie just carried on, facing left stage, straight in my direction.</p><p>The crowd go insane, clapping and cheering.</p><p>Jake never plays the keyboard on stage. He knows how to play, but he\u2019s more of a guitar man. I was always the piano player out of the two of us.</p> <p>A sudden nervous energy sweeps over me, spreading from my head down to my toes.</p><p>Speaking into the mic, Jake addresses the fans. \u201cThis tour has been amazing for us in so many ways. It was always going to be a hard one for us, but you guys \u2013 our fans, have helped us make it a real tribute for Jonny. So we thank you for that.\u201d</p><p>The crowd picks up with cheers again.</p><p>\u201cAnother amazing thing about this tour,\u201d Jakes says over the cheers, \u201cwas that it brought someone back to me who I made the mistake of once letting go many years ago \u2013 someone important.\u201d</p><p>He looks straight at me in the muted darkness. My whole body trembles under the weight of his stare</p><p>His eyes drift down from mine, as he starts speaking again. \u201cShe once asked me, if I had to pick one song out of every song ever written to best describe me, which would it be. I said the song I\u2019m about to sing.\u201d</p><p>My skin starts to prickle as I remember our conversation that night in bed...</p><p>\u201cIf you, Jake Wethers, had to pick one song as your title song to describe yourself, what would it be?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome people said Reznor was writing a lyrical suicide note, others said he was writing about finding a reason to live. But I think it\u2019s both ... it just depends on which side you\u2019re looking at it from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd which side are you looking at it from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow ... a reason to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReznor\u2019s version or Johnny Cash\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohnny Cash ... I have a few things in common with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe drugs ... the women ... hanging out for the girl of my dreams ... you\u2019re my June, Tru.\u201d</p><p>I hear his deep inhalation of breath echo around the stadium before he says, \u201cSo tonight, I\u2019m singing this for her, my June.\u201d</p><p>That will mean nothing to anyone else, but everything to me.</p><p>Jake looks across at me, his fingers hovering the keys. He looks lost, afraid and desperate.</p><p>I can\u2019t move. I\u2019m pinioned to the spot.</p><p>He closes his eyes, concealing his pain, then presses his fingers down on the keys and begins to play \u2018Hurt\u2019.</p><p>Leaning his mouth close to the mic, he starts to sing, and I feel a stabbing pain in my chest so hard that I can barely breathe.</p><p>Jake\u2019s voice is deep and powerful, and is echoing raw around the stadium.</p><p>And I know in this moment what he\u2019s doing.</p><p>He\u2019s not playing Cash\u2019s version, he\u2019s playing Rezner\u2019s. He\u2019s telling me he\u2019s back there. He\u2019s telling me he\u2019s lost his reason to live.</p><p>Me.</p><p>I see it in his eyes when he opens them again, looking straight at me, singing so hauntingly beautiful.</p><p>And I can\u2019t help the tears that start to run down my face.</p><p>My heart is breaking as we stare at one another. Jake is singing his body dry to me, and for this moment it\u2019s only him and me in this crowded stadium, in the whole world, the entire universe.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s baring himself to the world like this.</p><p>Exposing us.</p><p>This isn\u2019t Jake. He\u2019s private. And I don\u2019t want this. This is exactly what I don\u2019t want.</p><p>Then it\u2019s all too much, and I\u2019m moving before I realise. Turning, I push past Stuart and Simone, and run off stage.</p><p>I have no idea where I\u2019m going, I just have to get away.</p><p>Away from his pain, from my pain. Just far away from this complete agony that he\u2019s inflicting upon me.</p><p>I hear my name being called from behind, but I can\u2019t stop.</p><p>I\u2019m running past people, god knows how in these heels, tears blurring my vision.</p><p>The next thing I know Jake is grabbing hold of me from behind, pulling me around to face him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he pants, breathless. There are tears in his eyes. Mine are dripping off my chin, down onto my lovely dress.</p><p>There are people everywhere, watching us.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d I pull myself free from his hold and step back down a corridor out of everyone\u2019s view.</p><p>Jake follows me.</p><p>I wipe my face dry with my hands. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have sung that song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do? You won\u2019t talk to me. You won\u2019t listen. You\u2019ve just cut me off dry.\u201d His face crumples. \u201cI knew the only way I could get you to finally hear me was through music. And that song, what we talked about that night...\u201d He steps close to me, cupping my cheek with his hand.</p><p>I almost break at the feel of his skin on mine after been so long without him, so bereft without him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my life, Tru. My everything. And you always will be. I need you to know that, and I need you to believe me when I tell you I didn\u2019t have sex with that girl.\u201d</p><p>I swallow past my salty tears. \u201cI know Jake. Stuart just got a call saying the girl is withdrawing her story. She\u2019s admitted it was all a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has?\u201d His words come out in a breath. I see a myriad of emotions pass over his face \u2013 shock, but mainly relief. Complete and utter relief. \u201cSo you know it\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>I gulp down hard against the words I know I have to say.</p><p>\u201cJake, I believed that you\u2019ve been telling the truth for a while now. I didn\u2019t at first ... seeing you there with her, it was so horrific...\u201d I wince at the memory. \u201cBut I do now. I believed you long before she decided to tell the truth. Hearing her admit it is of course a relief, but it doesn\u2019t change anything. We still can\u2019t be together.\u201d</p><p>I watch as a dozen emotions scroll across his face.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asks hurt.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not cut out for this life with you. I\u2019m not strong enough to handle the stuff that comes with it \u2013 with you. Deep down I already knew, but this past week with what happened, and the constant press attention it brought, details of our private life becoming reading material for people has just proven to me what I already knew. I thought I could live with it \u2013 live my life so publicly if it meant having you, but ... I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I leave his stare, casting my eyes down, the pain in his face almost too much to bear. Fresh tears break free down my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give it all up,\u201d his tone is suddenly fixed, serious.</p><p>I\u2019ve only heard him sound like this once before \u2013 when he was going to cancel the PR for the tour and come to me in the London.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave it all behind \u2013 the band, the label, everything,\u201d he adds resolute.</p><p>My eyes flick back up to his. \u201cNo, Jake, you can\u2019t do that for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can, and I will,\u201d he says steadily. \u201cI\u2019ll give everything up without a second thought if it means being with you. We can move away from everyone just like we talked about that time. You remember on the phone? When we talked about building a house on an island. It doesn\u2019t just have to be a pipe dream, we can really do that. Just me and you. We can have a house built wherever you want, away from all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake...\u201d I shake my head. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t work because it\u2019s not who you are. This is what you live for \u2013 the music, the performing. It\u2019s who you are, and if you gave it up for me, after a time you\u2019d start to resent me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes you would. And even if by some miracle you didn\u2019t, it still wouldn\u2019t make a difference ... because they\u2019re not ready to let you go.\u201d I gesture in the direction of the chanting crowd out beyond in the stadium, the ones calling out his name. \u201cThe world, your fans, they love you too. And they\u2019re not ready to let go of Jake Wethers \u2013 not yet ... maybe not ever.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows pull in. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not ready to let go of you, and I never will be.\u201d</p><p>Briefly closing my eyes, I say, \u201cI\u2019m not enough for you, Jake, that\u2019s why you turned back to the drugs after the news story broke about your dad. I don\u2019t know what is enough for you, but it\u2019s not me. I\u2019m not enough to keep you straight like you once said I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t honestly believe that? Jesus Christ, Tru!\u201d His tone is so forceful, it yanks my eyes back to him.</p><p>His eyes are as fiercely determined as his voice.</p><p>\u201cI was just being a weak fuckin\u2019 idiot! It was about me and him \u2013 my demons that I never exorcised, never about you or us. And I promise you I will never go back there again. Losing you because of what I did \u2013 because of the drugs, was the single worst thing that has ever happened to me. If I was ever going to need to keep using it was this last week losing you. But I stopped, Tru. I haven\u2019t touched a thing since that night, and I won\u2019t ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I drowned that night in LA, nearly dying like that, I thought it was enough to stop me, but it wasn\u2019t ... because I didn\u2019t know the meaning of the word dying until you left me. This last week without you...\u201d He pulls in a sharp breath, briefly closing his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m nothing without you Tru, nothing.\u201d</p><p>His words on some fundamental level are reaching me, touching me, because I know exactly how he feels. I\u2019ve felt so lost, so adrift ... so dead inside without him.</p><p>But how can we be together with all these problems we have sitting between us? I know I can\u2019t deal with the life that accompanies him.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI just don\u2019t know, Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He tightens his hold on me, clinging to my face desperately with his hand, tangling his fingers into my hair.</p><p>My emotions are rising to epic proportions, so I clench my teeth forbidding anymore tears to fall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen we\u2019re good, we\u2019re great, Jake. But when we\u2019re bad, we\u2019re fucking horrendous. From the moment we came back into each other\u2019s lives all we\u2019ve managed to do is hurt one another, badly \u2013 and too many times to think of.\u201d I exhale. \u201cI once used to think we were meant to be together, but now ... now I\u2019m not so sure. Maybe we just wanted to be together so badly when we were younger that we tried to force it so desperately now. Maybe our time just passed long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he shakes his head vehemently. \u201cWe\u2019re meant to be.\u201d</p><p>He puts his other hand on my face, forcing my eyes to his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never be good enough for you, I know that. But I\u2019m no good without you, and if that makes me a selfish bastard for wanting you as badly as I do then so be it because I can\u2019t live a life that doesn\u2019t have you in it.\u201d</p> <p>He stares deep into my eyes, breathing deeply. I can feel his hands trembling against my skin.</p><p>\u201cMarry me,\u201d he says without hesitation.</p><p>Every ounce of air in my lungs whooshes straight out of me, a thousand thoughts scattering across my mind.</p><p>Freeing a hand from my face, Jake reaches into his jean pocket and pulls out a ring.</p><p>The ring.</p> <p>I stare at him, my eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cI got it before we left Paris.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the pink diamond ring I was looking at in Tiffany\u2019s the night he bought me the necklace.</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe you bought it.\u201d I\u2019m gasping for air.</p><p>He holds the ring up between us. \u201cI knew I\u2019d be asking you to be my wife from the very second you walked into that hotel room and back into my life. And when I saw your face that night looking at this ring, I just knew \u2013 I knew it belonged on your finger, and I\u2019ve been waiting for the right moment ever since to ask you. I know now is not the most romantic, or perfect time to propose.\u201d He glances around at our dim concrete surroundings. \u201cBut now is the only time I have before I lose you for good. So I\u2019ll ask you again...\u201d He pulls in a deep breath. \u201cTrudy Bennett, I love you beyond any lyrics I could ever write, or any words I could ever say. I always have, and I always will. Marry me?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, speechless.</p> <p>My best friend. My lover. My life.</p><p>And he is my life. He always has been, even through our years apart.</p><p>Jake is all I think of, all I see when I look into my future. And tries as I might to fight being with him for fear of his life, of getting hurt by it, it simply hurts more to be without him. I see that now.</p><p>Eventually, I would have followed my heart back to him, because he is my everything.</p><p>Jake once said on stage that Jonny was the mighty in their storm, and now I see that Jake is my mighty storm. He\u2019s broken and complex, and no one knows him like I do, or ever will. He needs me.</p><p>He\u2019s my storm to calm. And I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my life doing just that.</p><p>\u201cSay something, Tru, please, you\u2019re killing me here.\u201d His voice is painted with nerves, his chest rising and falling heavily. \u201cJust say anything but no \u2013 don\u2019t say no \u2013 just tell me what I need to do for you to say yes and I\u2019ll do it. Because I can\u2019t spend another second without you.\u201d</p><p>I reach my hand up and touch his face, smoothing my fingers over his skin, trying to erase his fears, and the lost look in his eyes, the one which only I can see.</p> <p>Then I smile.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do anything. Yes, I\u2019ll marry you.\u201d</p><p>His face breaks into the biggest smile I\u2019ve ever seen, mirroring my own. Complete adoration in his eyes reserved only for me.</p><p>\u201cYou will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>I hold my left hand up to him and halting my breath, I watch as he takes my hand and slides the ring over my knuckle, setting it to rest on my finger.</p><p>The diamond is huge against my hand.</p><p>Keeping my hand in his, Jake lifts it to his mouth and kisses the ring on my finger. Then I can\u2019t contain my bubbling happiness any longer, and it bursts out of me in full technicolor glory and I\u2019m grabbing his face kissing him hard, smothering him with the absolute pure love I feel for him.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d he says against my lips. \u201cI\u2019ll never let you down again, baby. I swear. I\u2019ll make you so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I breathe. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...?\u201d I hear a voice from behind Jake, and moving my mouth from his, I glance past him to see Tom here grinning at us both.</p><p>Jakes turns, taking me with him, unwilling to let me go just yet.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he says irritably to Tom.</p><p>\u201cWell Romeo, we were just wondering if there\u2019s any chance of you making an appearance back on stage at any point tonight? Because there are twenty thousand seriously pissed off fans out there,\u201d he thumbs over his shoulder, \u201cwho can\u2019t figure why the fuck you just bolted off stage like a crazy person mid-way through a song \u2013 and apparently my singing just isn\u2019t cutting, so I\u2019m envisaging a fuckin\u2019 riot any minute if you don\u2019t get your sorry ass back out on stage.\u201d</p><p>Laughing at Tom, I slide my hands into Jake\u2019s back pockets. \u201cYou better go finish your show.\u201d I smile up at him.</p><p>He looks down at me reluctant.</p><p>\u201cThey paid good money to hear you sing, baby. You owe then that encore. I\u2019ll be here waiting when you\u2019re done. I\u2019m not going anywhere. Remember, I promised. I\u2019m yours now, forever.\u201d I slide my hand out of his pocket, lifting my ring up to him.</p><p>\u201cForever,\u201d he echoes, brushing my hair off my face, he kisses my lips again. \u201cCome on then, let\u2019s go give these people what they paid to see.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s about to move when I ask him, \u201cAre you still going to sing Hurt?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want him to. I want him to leave that song behind now. I want us both to start afresh.</p><p>Jake rests his hands either side of my neck, touching my face with his thumbs, he tilts his head to the side. I see the flicker of memory and humour in his eyes as he shakes his head, no. \u201cI\u2019m thinking maybe I need a new title song, and I was thinking ... I dunno.\u201d He pushes his lip together in thought, his brow creasing. \u201cWhat about ... I Can\u2019t Get No Satisfaction?\u201d</p><p>I grin, feeling that familiar pull and heat in my belly, remembering just exactly what we did that night after all our talking was done.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d I scrunch my face up in thought. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll have to see what I can do about that.\u201d</p><p>Spying a room which looks very much like a dressing room, I take Jake by the hand and start to lead him toward it.</p><p>Turning to Tom, I say, \u201cTell them he\u2019ll back out on stage in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen,\u201d Jake adds from behind me.</p><p>I stop, turning, I meet his grinning eyes.</p><p>\u201cTechnically the song only lasts just short of four minutes,\u201d I state, smiling.</p><p>\u201cOh, this is the unreleased extended version, Mrs. Wethers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Wethers to be,\u201d I correct.</p><p>\u201cTechnicality,\u201d he grins. \u201cAnd one that I\u2019ll be rectifying very soon.\u201d</p><p>Then he sweeps me up off my feet, and squealing with laughter I let him carry me into the dressing room, closing and locking the door behind us, leaving Tom, and the rest of the world outside to wait.</p><p>Meet Jake ...</p><p>Chapter One \u2013 The Hotel</p><p>I can\u2019t fucking sit still.</p><p>Ever since Stuart told me the name of the interviewer coming this morning, I\u2019ve been pacing around like a dickhead. My head is flipping about all over the place.</p><p>What if it\u2019s her?</p><p>What do I say?</p><p>She might be pissed at me. I was the one who stopped contact when I moved to the States. And when I hit the big time with the band she never attempted to get in touch with me.</p><p>That\u2019d be just like Tru to hold a twelve year grudge. She was always a feisty one.</p><p>Tru Bennett.</p><p>It might not be her.</p><p>How many Trudy Bennett\u2019s could there be in the UK who are music journalists?</p><p>She was music first, a writer second. It has to be her.</p><p>What time is it?</p><p>I\u2019m driving myself nuts here. I just wish she\u2019d hurry the fuck up and get here so can put myself out of my misery.</p><p>I know I\u2019m acting like a crazy mother fucker right now, but it\u2019s Tru.</p><p>There was only ever her for me, and that never changed in the whole time I\u2019ve been apart from her.</p><p>She was the only one who knew me back then, and only she could tie me up like this.</p><p>She was my best friend, the only girl I ever loved, and I\u2019ve missed the shit out of her.</p><p>It\u2019s times like this when I wish I wasn\u2019t clean. I could really do with a hit right now.</p><p>Fuck. I need a smoke.</p><p>I get them out of my pocket and light one up.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a drink?\u201d Stuart asks walking into the living room. \u201cMaybe a whiskey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Yes. No.\u201d I pull on my smoke and blow it out.</p><p>\u201cAny conclusion on that drink yet?\u201d Stuart says cocking his head to the side.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah you want one. Or yeah you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might calm you down.\u201d He crosses the room, heading toward the mini-bar.</p><p>\u201cYeah but if I have one then I might not stop.\u201d</p><p>He gets one of those mini Diet Coke cans out and cracks it open.</p><p>Coke, that\u2019s what I need right now, and not of the diet varity.</p><p>\u201cThis girl sure has got you freaked out.\u201d Stuart has another drink, and draining the can, he tosses it in the trash.</p><p>I turn to him, taking a long drag of my smoke. \u201cBecause she\u2019s not just any girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Stuart raises his eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I take another long drag, then stub it out in the ashtray. \u201cShe\u2019s the only girl I\u2019ve ever loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you did love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly the once.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Stuart comes over and picks the ashtray up.</p><p>I know he\u2019s going to clean it out. He hates my smoking. I think he\u2019s worried it will prematurely age him or something.</p><p>Gay guys. I\u2019ll never understand them. Stuart\u2019s cool though, he\u2019s been with me from the start and he\u2019s great at his job. He\u2019s also saved my ass more times than I care to remember.</p><p>Women are my thing. I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend. I just like to fuck. Hard. And often. Then move onto the next.</p><p>There has only ever been one girl I loved, one girl I wanted to be mine, and she might be walking through that door any minute now.</p><p>What if she looks completely different?</p><p>She used to be really beautiful. She had this amazing ass and a smoking hot body, even as a teenager. And she had the best pair of tits I had ever seen, not that I\u2019d seen many back then, well only hers to be honest, and I only got to see them by accident when she lost her bikini one time when we were swimming. Even at thirteen she had a sizeable pair. Tru was an early developer, all for my luck.</p><p>Fuck. What if she\u2019s married now, and has kids or something.</p><p>Whatever. Either way it\u2019s Tru, and I need to see her.</p><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s not her coming?\u201d Stuart asks walking back through, with my, yep \u2013 clean ashtray. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen your next job is to find her for me.\u201d</p><p>At his expression, I give him an, \u2018And no I\u2019m not fucking kidding\u2019 look.</p><p>\u201cDo you have OCD or something? You know there\u2019s treatment for that kind of thing, right?\u201d I grin at him.</p><p>\u201cOCD is better than STD, Jake.\u201d He raises his eyebrow.</p> <p>I\u2019ve never had an STD in my life, cheeky bastard. Sheeted and ready to go. I never leave the house without a condom. Well, I never know when I might need one. Trust me, I\u2019ve had sex at the most inappropriate of times, with the wrong kinds of women.</p><p>Aside from making music, fucking is the only other thing I am good at.</p><p>Jesus Christ what time is it? She should be here by now.</p><p>It\u2019s got to be her because she\u2019s late. Tru was always late for everything.</p><p>I wonder if she still plays the piano. I\u2019ll have to ask her. If it is her that is.</p> <p>Fuck, is she ever going to turn up!</p><p>The suite phone starts to ring and I instantly tense up.</p><p>Stuart answers. \u201cSend her straight up, someone will meet her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here,\u201d he says turning to me. \u201cI\u2019ll send Dave to meet her at the elevator.\u201d</p><p>I sit down on the sofa.</p><p>Okay, I\u2019ve gotta knock this off, I\u2019m acting like a fucking woman.</p> <p>It\u2019s just Tru. And if it\u2019s not, then it\u2019s just another lame ass interview to get through. Then afterwards I can finally stop being a pussy and find her.</p><p>I grab one of the hotel provided mints off the coffee table, unwrap it and put it in my mouth. I don\u2019t want to stink of cigarettes if it is her.</p><p>It\u2019s another five minutes before I hear a knock at the main door.</p><p>It\u2019s definitely got to be her because it\u2019s a clear two minutes up here from reception, and Tru was always good at taking her time.</p><p>I stand up. Nervous energy is rushing through me.</p><p>I can hear Stuart talking. I strain to hear the other voice but I can\u2019t hear a thing.</p><p>Would I recognise her voice anyway? It\u2019s been so long since I last heard it.</p><p>It seems ages before Stuart walks into the living room, and there she is behind him.</p> <p>Tru.</p><p>It\u2019s her.</p><p>And fuck me, she looks beautiful, stunning, and I know in this moment I am never letting go of her again.</p><p>She walks a little further into the room.</p><p>I can\u2019t take my eyes off her. She looks amazing.</p><p>She\u2019s wearing a loose grey T-shirt, belted, showing her tiny waist off, and her tits look amazing in it, perfect. And she\u2019s got this cute little skirt on. It\u2019s short and is showing plenty of leg. Fuck those legs got long, and she\u2019s wearing this pair of come-fuck-me-now boots which would look amazing wrapped around my waist.</p><p>\u201cTru?\u201d My voice comes out a little hoarse. I take a deep breath. \u201cTrudy Bennett? My Trudy Bennett?\u201d I repeat like a fucking moron.</p><p>Of course it\u2019s her you fuckwit.</p><p>I take a step forward. \u201cShit, it really is you.\u201d</p><p>What the hell is wrong with me? Why can\u2019t I stop talking like a dumbass?</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s really me,\u201d she says.</p><p>She sounds like a fucking angel. My dick twitches and starts to harden in response.</p><p>Aw, fuck no! Don\u2019t get a hard on Wethers for fucks sake. What are you, fifteen?</p><p>Distraction quick.</p><p>I think of that time I walked in on Stuart kissing a dude.</p><p>Yep, that\u2019ll do it.</p><p>Down you go boy.</p><p>Okay, game face on now Wethers.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I say, smiling at her, moving a bit closer. \u201cWhen Stuart said the name of the interviewer was Trudy Bennett, I just thought \u2013 there can\u2019t be that many Trudy Bennett\u2019s here in the UK can there? \u2013 I mean there probably is but \u2013\u201d I laugh. \u201cBut then I just thought it would be too much of a coincidence for it to be you ... and shit ... here you are.\u201d</p><p>What the fuck was that dickwad? If that\u2019s what you call your game face nowadays then you are so totally screwed.</p><p>I haven\u2019t felt this lame around a woman since I was last around her and at least I had the excuse of been a teenager back then. What\u2019s my excuse now?</p><p>It can\u2019t be because I\u2019m clean because I fucked every hot chick there was in rehab, including the hot married counsellor and a few other skirts since I\u2019ve been out.</p><p>It\u2019s because it\u2019s her.</p><p>\u201cHere I am,\u201d she says.</p><p>She sounds nervous. I like that she is. It gives me a rise.</p><p>I walk over to her, just needing to be closer to her.</p><p>And the nearer I get, I see a blush colour her cheeks.</p><p>She just looks so fucking beautiful.</p><p>Tru is the most beautiful, perfect person I have ever seen in my life.</p><p>More than anything I just want to touch her, but I\u2019m almost afraid to.</p><p>And fuck, she smells amazing.</p><p>It\u2019s not just the perfume, it\u2019s her. The scent takes me back years. And I suddenly feel an overwhelming sense of love and protectiveness over her.</p><p>I haven\u2019t wanted a woman ever, in the way I want her now. I don\u2019t only want to screw her; I want to hold her in my arms.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been what \u2013 eleven years?\u201d I ask her, trying to get my head straight.</p><p>\u201cTwelve,\u201d she corrects.</p><p>\u201cTwelve. Christ, yeah, right.\u201d I push my hand through my hair. \u201cYou look different ... but the same \u2013 you know,\u201d I shrug.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she smiles. \u201cYou look different too.\u201d She gestures to the tattoos on my arms.</p><p>I grin down at them.</p><p>\u201cBut still the same,\u201d she says, pointing her pretty little finger at my nose.</p><p>She means my freckles. I fucking hate them.</p><p>I rub my hand over his nose. \u201cYeah, no getting rid of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always liked them.\u201d</p><p>She did?</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you liked the Care Bears, Tru,\u201d I tease.</p><p>She blushes, again.</p><p>\u201cYou remember that, huh?\u201d she murmurs, looking down.</p><p>I have the urge to want to reach out and run my fingers over her pink cheeks.</p><p>Actually, I have the urge to want to do a lot more with her right now.</p><p>Kiss her, peel her clothes off...</p><p>\u201cI remember a lot.\u201d I give her my best grin, the one that has woman dropping their panties for me.</p><p>\u201cCome on let\u2019s sit down.\u201d I grab hold of her left hand, for two reasons.</p><p>One \u2013 I\u2019m feeling for a wedding ring. Two \u2013 I just really need to touch her.</p><p>No ring. Thank fuck. But my skin heats at the contact with her, and my cock twitches in my pants again.</p><p>Fuck! Not again.</p><p>Stuart and a dude. Stuart and dude.</p><p>While I focus on getting my dick to tame the fuck down, I lead her over to sofa and sit down.</p><p>She sits next to me, but leaves a huge gap, I notice.</p><p>I turn toward her, crossing my legs. I look at hers while she puts her bag on the floor.</p><p>That cute little skirt of hers has ridden up, and is showing plenty of those sexy stems.</p><p>I suppress a moan as an image of me touching her leg, running my hand over her smooth, olive skin, up and under that sexy little skirt, flashes through my mind.</p><p>\u201cDo you want something to drink?\u201d I ask her, chasing the mental picture away.</p><p>She turns her legs toward me.</p><p>Fuck! Is she teasing me or something? I\u2019m itching to put my hands on her and see if her skin is as soft as it looks. If she were any other woman, I\u2019d have done that and more by now.</p><p>She\u2019d be shirtless and skirtless, and I\u2019d be well on my way to fucking her to the finish line, if she was anyone else.</p><p>But she\u2019s not just anyone.</p><p>She\u2019s Tru.</p><p>She was my best friend, and is, and always will be way more than a quick fuck, irrespective of what my cock is saying right now.</p><p>It\u2019s the most fucking confusing feeling I\u2019ve ever had in my life. And I don\u2019t do confused. I want something I take it, or I make it happen.</p><p>But I just can\u2019t do that with her.</p><p>I fix my eyes on her face, avoiding the temptation to look at her legs again or her tits for that matter, and give her the respect she deserves.</p><p>\u201cWater would be great, thanks,\u201d she says. Her cheeks redden again.</p><p>Did she used to blush this much when we were kids?</p><p>\u201cWater?\u201d I query. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want orange juice or something?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cWater\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuart!\u201d I yell.</p><p>He shows his face a few seconds later. That was quick. I bet the nosey bastard has been stood by the door listening in.</p><p>\u201cCan you get Tru a glass of water and I\u2019ll have an orange juice, please.\u201d</p><p>Stuart nods, smiling at me, then goes off to get our drinks.</p><p>Nosy fucker has been listening in.</p><p>I\u2019m feeling restless. I need a smoke but I don\u2019t want to light up in front of her for some unexplained reason.</p><p>\u201cSo, this is a little crazy, huh?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHmm. A little.\u201d She casts a glance at me, pressing her gorgeous pouty lips together.</p><p>I want to kiss them, see them around my dick...</p><p>\u201cSo how have you been?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cGood. Great. I\u2019m music journalist now, obviously...\u201d she mumbles.</p><p>She seems really uncomfortable around me. Maybe she\u2019s not as happy to see me, as I am her.</p><p>\u201cYou always were a good writer,\u201d I encourage.</p><p>\u201cI was?\u201d She looks surprised.</p><p>\u201cYeah, those stories you used to make up when we were little, and then you used to make me sit and listen to you while you read them back to me,\u201d I chuckle.</p><p>She was such a cute thing when she was younger.</p><p>Her face goes bright red. \u201cOh God,\u201d she groans. \u201cI was so lame.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cYou were five, Tru. I think we can forgive the lame.\u201d I drag my fingers through my hair. \u201cAnd of course you always loved music so it makes sense the two went together. You still play the piano?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She was amazing on the keys. I could sit and listen to her play for hours when we were younger.</p><p>\u201cNo. I stopped\u2013\u201d she pauses. It makes me curious. \u201cI just, um, haven\u2019t played in a long time. I fell out of it, you know,\u201d she adds sounding really uncomfortable now. \u201cWell obviously you don\u2019t know.\u201d She gestures to my guitar.</p><p>I smile at her, but I\u2019m not feeling it.</p><p>Why is she so uncomfortable around me? I thought she might be pissed at me for stopping contact, but not uncomfortable.</p><p>It\u2019s not the whole me being famous shit is it? She was the one person I would never have expected that from.</p><p>I sigh inwardly.</p><p>Stuart reappears with our drinks.</p><p>Tru thanks him for her drink.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d Stuart asks me.</p><p>Apart from her?</p><p>I look at Tru in question. She shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re good thanks,\u201d I say dismissing him.</p><p>I have a drink of my juice.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019d ask how you\u2019re doing but...\u201d she gestures around at our surroundings.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m great.\u201d I force a laugh, and rub my hand over chin. Leaning forward, I put my drink down on the table and rest my forearms on my legs.</p><p>The girl I loved, still love, doesn\u2019t appear to have missed me like I\u2019ve missed her. The one girl that has meant so much to me for so long, the one I had to let go of, but never forgot, and have been too afraid to find, looks like she\u2019d rather be anywhere but here with me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So yeah, I\u2019m absolutely fan-fucking-tastic.</p><p>I wonder why she came? Probably forced to by her editor.</p><p>I feel like such a dumbass. I\u2019ve been here freaking out like a fucking idiot over her, and she\u2019s just indifferent to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve followed your music career,\u201d she says out of the blue.</p> <p>\u201cYou have?\u201d</p><p>Now I am surprised. I wouldn\u2019t have thought she cared to.</p><p>\u201cOf course I have. Music is my job.\u201d</p><p>Of course it is. So it\u2019s not because it was me, but because of who I am.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not just why,\u201d she adds. \u201cI wanted to see how you were doing. And you\u2019ve just achieved so much. I was really proud watching you on TV and reading the articles about your music, and when you set up your own label \u2013 I was like, \u2018Wow\u2019 ... and I\u2019ve got bought all your albums, of course and they\u2019re really brilliant.\u201d</p> <p>What?</p><p>I don\u2019t get her. One minute she\u2019s acting like she couldn\u2019t give a shit about seeing me. The next she\u2019s tripping over her words, trying to give me the impression she does.</p><p>Easiest way to find out \u2013 ask her. I\u2019ve always been in the mind-set that you should say what you think. What\u2019s the point in sitting on shit trying to figure it out for yourself when the answer to your question is sitting right in front of you.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you get in touch with me, Tru?\u201d</p><p>She stares at me for a long moment. I see what I think is confusion flicker over her face.</p><p>\u201cUm... you\u2019re not exactly easy to get in touch with \u2013 Mr Famous Rock Star.\u201d</p> <p>I hear the hard edge clear in her voice.</p><p>Yep, she\u2019s pissed that I cut contact with her. That I can work with.</p><p>Indifferent, no. But angry, yes.</p><p>And angry makes her so very fucking hot right now. Even hotter if that\u2019s possible.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s me \u2013 one of the most accessibly, inaccessible people on the planet,\u201d I say staring at her.</p><p>I\u2019m totally giving her edge, because right now all I want to do is piss her off further.</p><p>I want her to get her issue off her hot chest, so we can get to the good stuff. And also I can imagine an angry Tru, is a very hot Tru.</p><p>I keep my eyes on her, but she\u2019s not saying anything. What the fuck! Why isn\u2019t she kicking my ass right now?</p> <p>The Tru I knew would have torn a strip off me.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019s not the same girl she used to be.</p><p>She seemed the same, but maybe not.</p><p>I need a smoke. Fuck waiting.</p><p>I get them out of my pocket and perch one between my lips. \u201cDo you smoke?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Nothing worse than a woman who smokes if you ask me. \u201cYou mind if I do?\u201d I don\u2019t normally ask anyone ever. I wanna smoke, I smoke, but for her it just seems appropriate to ask.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says firmly.</p><p>So she does mind.</p><p>But I need a smoke so I\u2019m taking advantage of her inbuilt politeness and am having one anyway.</p><p>Lighting up, I take a long drag, pulling back hard, enjoying the momentary relief the nicotine gives me.</p><p>I drop my smokes and lighter onto the table, and then I suddenly hear music.</p><p>Is that Adele? Where the fuck is that coming from? It better not be Stuart listening to his crap music again.</p><p>Tru scrabbles for her bag.</p><p>It\u2019s coming from her cell. I\u2019m surprised she\u2019s got Adele as her ringtone. Doesn\u2019t fit with the Tru I remember. But then a lot isn\u2019t fitting with her right now.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she mumbles, pulling her cell out, silencing it. \u201cIt might be my boss.\u201d</p><p>I watch her face as she quickly reads the text. A small smile forms on her lips.</p><p>Boyfriend, maybe? I fucking hope not. But look at her. No, she\u2019ll have a boyfriend, there is no way she\u2019ll be single looking like she does.</p><p>I bet he\u2019s a stuck up asshole.</p><p>I\u2019ll find out who he is from her, and get Stuart to do some digging on him later.</p><p>I need to know what my competition is.</p><p>Anyone else, I\u2019d just be able to take without an ounce of work, but not her.</p><p>If there\u2019s anything of the Tru I remember still in there, and I\u2019m pretty sure there is, then I know for sure that I have my work cut out for me to get her to be mine.</p><p>\u201cAdele?\u201d I grin, referring to her cell. I like to tease her. I always did.</p><p>\u201cI like her.\u201d She sounds defensive.</p><p>\u201cOh me too.\u201d I nod, holding back the smile I can feel rising. \u201cShe\u2019s a nice girl. I just figured from what I remember of you, I\u2019d have been hearing the Stones playing on your cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well I\u2019ve changed a lot since you knew me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll take that as the dig it was meant as. Wow, she really is harbouring a grudge against me.</p><p>Which means she still cares. I\u2019m so totally in the game.</p><p>I watch her with interest as she puts her cell away. Oh, she\u2019s pulling her notebook out. She wants to start the interview.</p><p>We haven\u2019t seen each other for twelve fucking years and she wants to interview me. It stings more than I expected.</p><p>\u201cSo, I should get started with the interview \u2013 I\u2019m sure you\u2019re really busy and I don\u2019t want to keep you for longer than necessary.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m really in the mood to play now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not keeping me.\u201d I take a long, drag of my cigarette. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not busy today. My schedule is clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. You haven\u2019t got any other interviews after mine?\u201d She looks surprised.</p><p>Stage one of getting her commences ... now. Flattery.</p><p>\u201cWell I did have ... consider them cancelled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Don\u2019t do that on my account.\u201d She practically squeals it at me.</p><p>Okay. So flattery isn\u2019t going to swing it with her.</p><p>Fuck this is hard work already. Am I sure I\u2019m cut out for this?</p><p>For her, Wethers, yes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean I\u2019m not happy to see you,\u201d she starts babbling. \u201cOf course I am, and would love to talk old times with you, but I don\u2019t want others to miss out on a great opportunity because of me.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s nervous again. Good sign.</p><p>\u201cA great opportunity?\u201d I give her another one of my panty dropping smiles.</p><p>She shrugs, looking abash. Her cheeks redden. \u201cOh, you know what I mean,\u201d she says quietly.</p><p>Okay Wethers, now is the time for sensitive. Hit her with our history. Get her remembering the good old days. You\u2019ve got thirty minutes to win her over before she walks out of that door, and you lose her again. Don\u2019t fuck this up like you did the last time.</p><p>\u201cLook Tru.\u201d I move toward her, putting all my focus on her. Women love that. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you for twelve years. The last thing I want to do right now is talk business with you, or anyone else for that matter. I want to know all about you \u2013 what you\u2019ve been doing since I last saw you.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs and looks down. \u201cNot much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done a lot more than \u2018not much\u2019,\u201d I urge, with a little force. I need to get her talking. Come on Tru.</p><p>She looks up at me with those beautiful brown eyes. I see a flicker of hurt in them.</p><p>It makes me feel like shit to know I once hurt her so bad to the point that she still feels it even now.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do after you left Manchester?\u201d she shrugs. \u201cI lived my life, I finished school.\u201d She sounds bitter.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d I keep my eyes on hers. I\u2019m not letting her go anywhere.</p><p>\u201cSchool? It was school. A little lonely after you left, but I got through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still see anyone from school?\u201d</p><p>She tucks her hair behind her ear. I have the urge to do just the same.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m friends with a couple of people on Facebook but that\u2019s about it. What about you?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I laugh. Not fucking likely. The only person I ever wanted to keep in touch with was her, but I just couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I reply. \u201cThen what did you do after school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoved here to go to uni. I got my degree in journalism. Then I landed a job at Etiquette, the magazine I work for, and I\u2019ve worked there ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d I take another drag of my cigarette.</p><p>Let\u2019s move this on now.</p><p>I\u2019m itching to know if she has a boyfriend or not. I know she\u2019s not married, but I also don\u2019t want her knowing I checked for that already.</p><p>Play it cool</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not married?\u201d I let my eyes go to her left hand giving her the impression it\u2019s the first time I\u2019m checking for sign of a ring.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d I take one last drag on my smoke and stub it out.</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a good or bad thing.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she finally replies.</p><p>Bad thing.</p><p>Even though I figured she\u2019d have one, it still drives a jealously nail through me I didn\u2019t know existed.</p><p>Holding my calm, I ask, \u201cLive together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I live with my flat mate Simone in Camden.\u201d</p><p>She sounds a bit pissed that I\u2019ve asked. I wonder why? Maybe she wants to live with him and he doesn\u2019t.</p><p>What fucking idiot wouldn\u2019t want to wake up to that beautiful face every single day?</p><p>One thing on my side is that it can\u2019t be serious if they don\u2019t live together. But then it also depends on how long they\u2019ve been together.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been with the boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Will, and we\u2019ve been together for two years.\u201d</p><p>Two years and not living together. Very good sign.</p><p>\u201cAnd what does Will do for a living?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an investment banker.\u201d</p><p>Yep. He\u2019s a prick. \u201cSmart guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is. He\u2019s very smart \u2013 top of his class at uni and he\u2019s climbing the ladder at work very quickly.\u201d She sounds defensive over him, and it pisses me off.</p><p>I grab my smokes and light another one up.</p><p>Tru unclips her pen from her notebook, and opens it up. \u201cIt\u2019s been really nice catching up with you Jake, but I really should get to the interview - especially if I want to keep my job.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she\u2019s back to that again. For fucks sake. What do I have to do to keep her interest in me and off this fucking interview?</p><p>I hate interviews at the best of times. Even more so, when all I want to do is figure out how to get her back into my life, and into my bed.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t get fired,\u201d I state.</p><p>I\u2019d ruin the fucking magazine if they ever even considered firing her.</p><p>\u201cYou sound pretty confident of that,\u201d she laughs, it sounds forced.</p><p>Does she not think I have that kind of pull? I\u2019ll show her just exactly what kind of pull I have, and also just what I have to offer her.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Staring at her, I take another pull on my smoke.</p><p>She shifts in her seat. I like that I make her nervous. And I\u2019m so going to use it to my advantage right now.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I probe. \u201cYou seem a little uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m not uncomfortable,\u201d she bites.</p><p>She so fucking is. And it\u2019s so fucking hot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI just need to\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo your job.\u201d I finish for her. \u201cOkay, go ahead, ask me anything. I\u2019m all yours, Tru for the next thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>She wants to interview me, fine, interview me. But I\u2019m going to have some fun while she does.</p><p>When I said I was good at two things, making music and fucking, that was a lie. I\u2019m good at something else, very good in fact, and that\u2019s talking.</p> <p>I glance at my watch, giving an air of indifference, and confidence, as I lean back against the sofa, putting one arm to rest on the back, I give her another one of my trade mark smiles.</p><p>It disarms her again. I can see it in her eyes. Good, because that was the intention.</p><p>She puts the end of the pen in her mouth, and I lose focus.</p><p>My dick starts to harden again as I watch that pen in her mouth, watching her chew it.</p><p>Fuck.</p> <p>I\u2019ve actually turned into a horny teenager.

Huge in fact.</p><p>I surreptitiously shift it about in my pants while she\u2019s not looking, having a drink of her water, begging the eager fucker to go back down.</p><p>At least I\u2019m sitting so it shouldn\u2019t be noticeable while it tames itself.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been said in the past that you\u2019re a perfectionist when it comes to your work,\u201d she says out of the blue. \u201c\u2013your music, and because of that you can be ... at times, difficult to work with. Do you agree with that? Do you consider yourself a perfectionist?\u201d</p><p>Now that\u2019s got my attention. I resist my urge to laugh.</p> <p>This is the Tru I know.</p><p>Let the games begin.</p><p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t work with me, Tru, they work for me. And the guys in my band, the ones who matter, don\u2019t seem to have a problem with the way I run things. But to answer your question, I want my music and my label to be the best it can be. Currently it is, and I intend to keep it that way, so if I have to bust a few balls and have myself labelled as a complete shit to work for, or a \u2018perfectionist\u2019 to keep me, my band and my label at the top of its game, then yeah, call me a perfectionist. I\u2019ve been called worse.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s staring at me, mouth wide open.</p><p>Good.</p><p>I watch as she scribbles down my answer, feeling pretty pleased with myself.</p><p>\u201cThe general feeling and what people are saying, is that \u2018Creed\u2019 is your most chart-friendly album to-date, do you agree with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve listened to the album?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m testing her.</p><p>\u201cOf course I have...\u201d she starts to stumble.</p><p>She\u2019s so sexy when she\u2019s nervous.</p><p>\u201c... and ... yes, I agree with the general consensus. I think that a lot of the songs are holding a softer tone than your previous albums. Especially \u2018Damned\u2019 and \u2018Sooner\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s garnering focus. Disarm her again.</p><p>\u201cGood. Then the point of the album is being received.\u201d I give her another smile, enjoying the feeling I get watching her thrown expression.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me \u2013 what would you be doing right now if you weren't talking to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be catching up with an old friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d she stumbles once again.</p><p>I\u2019m enjoying throwing her off balance. It\u2019s fun. And seriously hot to watch.</p><p>\u201cOkay ... it\u2019s been a while since you toured, are you looking forward to getting back on the road and playing live again?\u201d</p><p>I lean forward, closer to her.</p><p>She crosses her legs in front of me.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but look at them. Fuck, her skin looks so soft. I bet she tastes amazing.</p><p>Focus Wethers. Eyes up. You might be playing, having a little fun here with her, but respect her, remember. Treat her like the serious journalist and writer she is.</p><p>I look at her face as an idea starts to form in my mind.</p><p>\u201cPlaying live is what I love to do, it\u2019s what I live to do ... and I have a feeling this tour is going to be a very interesting one \u2013 probably my most interesting to date,\u201d I add, as that forming idea, turns into a sudden flash of inspiration.</p><p>Oh yes, this is a good idea. A very good idea. It relaxes me for sure.</p><p>Tru Bennett isn\u2018t going anywhere. Well not without me anyway, especially with what I have in mind for her.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, and why\u2019s that?\u201d she asks interested.</p><p>Enjoying my new found relaxed state, I run my hand through my hair. \u201cI\u2019ve just had a recent addition to my team and I know for sure she\u2019ll make things different, interesting ... better.\u201d</p><p>I see hint of what I think is jealousy in her eyes.</p><p>Nothing to be jealous of Tru. But I like that you are.</p><p>\u201cAnd this new addition,\u201d she questions. \u201cI\u2019m taking it she\u2019s not new a band member?\u201d</p><p>Lips pressed together, I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s part of the team putting the tour together?\u201d</p><p>Yep, she\u2019s definitely jealous. \u201cI put the tour together,\u201d I assert.</p><p>\u201cRight. So she\u2019s...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s say she does ... PR.\u201d I hold back the smug grin I feel.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me about your personal favorites on the album and where the inspiration for them came from?\u201d</p><p>Ah this is more like it. Talking music with Tru, I can get on board with this.</p><p>We go through the next half-hour talking music. It feels like old times, and it passes far too quickly.</p><p>I like the fact that she doesn\u2019t ask me a single question about Jonny, as I know for sure the next bunch of idiot interviewers will try to do just that.</p><p>And it\u2019s for reasons like this I love her. Because she has compassion, she cares about people.</p><p>She cared about me once. I want that back.</p><p>I watch her as she finishes scribbling down my answer to her last question.</p><p>Then she closes up her notebook and puts it in her bag.</p><p>Fuck, she\u2019s done. Time\u2019s up.</p><p>I don\u2019t want her to go.</p><p>Even though I\u2019m sure my little plan will work, I have this odd sense of loss creeping up on me.</p><p>I need to know when I\u2019m going to see her again.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been really good to see you, Tru.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d She smiles at me and it almost cracks me wide open.</p><p>She picks her bag up and gets to her feet. I stand too.</p><p>\u201cDid you bring a coat?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in my bag.\u201d She turns to me, looking up at me with those beautiful brown eyes of hers and my heart starts to fucking hurt. \u201cThank you again for the interview,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me; I\u2019d do an interview for you anytime.\u201d I\u2019ll give you my whole world if you\u2019ll let me.</p><p>\u201cI might hold you to that,\u201d she laughs.</p><p>\u201cDo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks again for your time.\u201d She\u2019s making for the door.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re heading back to work now?\u201d I ask, following behind her like a lost fucking puppy dog.</p><p>I want her to stay. More than anything I want her to stay, but I can\u2019t think up one reason to make that happen.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answers.</p><p>\u201cDo you need a ride? I can get Stuart to drive you,\u201d I offer.</p><p>I see a flicker of disappointment cross her face.</p><p>Stupid fucker, why didn\u2019t you offer to drive her? It would have given you more time with her you dickwad.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, thank you,\u201d she says softly. \u201cI\u2019ll walk, it\u2019s not far.\u201d</p><p>Maybe I could offer to drive her now? No, it\u2019ll sound too lame and desperate, dumbass.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d I ask, just for the sake of something to say. Anything to keep her here for a second longer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d She smiles and glances at the door.</p><p>She wants to leave. Fuck.</p><p>I reach for the door handle, then stop.</p><p>Dinner. Ask her out for dinner.</p><p>\u201cDo you have plans tonight ... because I was wondering if you would have dinner with me?\u201d</p><p>She looks a little stunned. Good thing or not?</p><p>It seems like forever before she answers. \u201cNo I don\u2019t have plans, I\u2019m free. Completely free.\u201d</p><p>A good thing.</p><p>I nearly sigh with relief.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Cool. So we can catch up properly without the threat of an interview hanging over us.\u201d I give her a cheeky smile.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says, her voice has gone all pitchy. She clears her throat and adds, \u201cSounds like plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight o\u2019clock okay?\u201d I ask smiling again. It\u2019s hard not to around her.</p><p>\u201cEight o\u2019clock is great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrite me down your address and I\u2019ll come pick you up.\u201d</p><p>She pulls her notebook out and writes down her address for me.</p><p>She hands it over. We touch in the exchange. My body heats again, heading straight to my groin.</p><p>I notice her hand is trembling slightly and her skin flushes.</p><p>Do I have the same effect on her as she has me? Maybe, just maybe.</p><p>I hold in the huge smile I feel.</p><p>A quick glance at her address, then I fold this piece of gold up and put it in my pocket.</p><p>I open the door for her, letting her through first. I\u2019m a gentleman for no one but her.</p><p>When we reach the main door, I stop and face her.</p><p>This is it. Now or never. I need her to leave here thinking of me.</p><p>Taking the plunge, I lift my hand to her face, skimming her soft skin, I tuck her beautiful, thick hair behind her ear; I would love to get my fingers tangled up in it.</p><p>Leaning down, I press my lips to her cheek, kissing her.</p><p>She feels amazing.</p><p>Her breathing hitches.</p><p>Good sign, Wethers.</p><p>I literally have to stop myself from punching the air like the jerk-off I am.</p><p>Lingering the kiss for as long as I can without it getting weird, I resist the urge to pull a move that will fuck everything up, and I move back away from her.</p><p>I need to take things slow with Tru if I\u2019m going to get her to be mine.</p><p>I want her, but I want her in the right way.</p><p>I give her a warm smile. \u201cSo I\u2019ll see you tonight then.\u201d I open the door.</p><p>\u201cYes, tonight. At eight.\u201d</p><p>She walks through the door, stumbling slightly.</p><p>I hold in the laugh I feel. She\u2019s so goddam cute.</p><p>\u201cBye, Jake.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s lingering. A great sign.</p><p>\u201cBye, Trudy Bennett.\u201d</p><p>She turns and walks down the hall. Yep, she still has an amazing ass.</p><p>I watch her walking away down the hall.</p><p>The phone in the suite rings so I reluctantly close the door.</p><p>Hearing Stuart talking, I figure the next interviewer is here. I groan inwardly.</p><p>The last thing I want to do is sit and talk to some fucktard.</p><p>What I really want to do is go rub one out and get this \u2018Tru hard-on\u2019 out of my system so I don\u2019t try and jump her when I see her tonight.</p><p>Actually, that might take a few dates with my hand for that not to happen.</p><p>With a sigh, I walk back in to the living room, heading for my cigarettes, hating that she\u2019s not here anymore, and wondering just what the fuck I can pull out of my sleeve to impress her tonight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>I don\u2019t do romance.
