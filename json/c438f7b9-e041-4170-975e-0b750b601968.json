I was pursuing a degree in Early Childhood Development. I had pulled an all-nighter, trying to prepare for an exam. I looked at the clock and realized it was after ten in the morning, and I still had a few things to go over. I was in major need of coffee if I was going to be able to process any more information. I was still in pajamas, my newly-dyed bright red hair in a crazy mess, so I took off my nightclothes and dragged a dress over my head. I grabbed my dad\u2019s old sweater off my desk chair, pulled it on, and shoved ten dollars, my key, and my phone into my pocket.</p><p>The weather was warm, so the streets were busy with college kids and young families who lived in the area out enjoying the beautiful day. When I arrived at the small caf\u00e9, there was a woman with a stroller trying to maneuver through the door. I jogged up to the door, pulling it open and letting her enter before me. Suddenly, I felt a chill slide down my spine. That\u2019s when I heard the loud rumble.</p><p>I looked over my shoulder as a large black truck was pulling into a parking spot in front of the shop. I watched as two men jumped down from the truck; the driver was good looking, but it was the passenger who gave me pause. He was tall, and his skin was golden brown, as if he spent hours in the sun. I could make out the definition of the muscles of his torso under his tight white t-shirt. His hair was dark brown and sticking out along the edge of his red baseball cap. When I realized I had been staring, and that he was watching me, I felt my cheeks get red, so I turned quickly and walked into the coffee shop without even holding the door for them. The coolness of the air conditioning and the smell of coffee helped to ease some of the tension that had coiled around me from seeing the guy. I wasn\u2019t someone who was used to those feelings. Lust was something my friends talked about, but I had never experienced it firsthand until that moment.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d the pretty blonde behind the counter asked, pulling me out of my thoughts. I looked at the menu board behind her. I didn\u2019t even know why I bothered; I never changed my drink.</p><p>\u201cCan I get a large iced coffee, dark, skim milk, with three Splenda?\u201d I gave her my order, watching her eyes get large. I felt heat hit my side. I didn\u2019t have to turn my head to know who was standing next to me; I could tell by the look on the girl\u2019s face that it was the guy from outside.</p> <p>\u201cI would like a large iced coffee, black,\u201d he interjected. The girl\u2019s eyes glazed over at the sound of his voice. I turned my head to look at him, wondering how pompous someone could be. \u201cHere, sugar, we\u2019re together, so just take hers out of that as well.\u201d He slid a twenty across the counter towards the girl, who hadn\u2019t taken her eyes off of him.</p><p>\u201cWe are not together.\u201d I clenched my fist; who the hell did this guy think he was?</p><p>\u201cWe are; I\u2019m paying.\u201d</p><p>I was so flustered by this guy that I could feel my always-calm temper start to slip. I didn\u2019t know if it was the lack of sleep or what, but when the coffee girl handed us our drinks, I turned on the guy. \u201cHere,\u201d I said, shoving the ten in my hand into his chest, making him stumble back into the person behind him. The lid on his coffee popped off when he squeezed it in his hand, making it go down the front of his shirt. \"Crap, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean for that to happen.\u201d Just my luck that something like that would happen. I felt so bad that I turned around, grabbed a few napkins from the dispenser behind me, and began patting his chest down, trying to sop up the coffee. It had made his T-shirt tighter, the wetness showing off his ab-muscles. I could feel my face growing redder by the second. \"Why couldn't you just let me pay for my own coffee?\" I asked. He started to laugh, making my head come up to hit his chin so hard that I heard his teeth crack together. My eyes watered in pain. \u201cThis is so humiliating,\u201d I whispered, feeling the tears as they began to fill my eyes. My hand went to the top of my head, where a large bump was forming.</p><p>\u201cLet me see your head, babe,\u201d Mr. Hot Guy said quietly, pulling me towards him. He took my coffee out of my hand, and handed it to the guy I had pushed him into. He held my wrist, pulling me over to the side. \u201cYou know, now I need your name and number for insurance purposes, right?\u201d It took a second for me to realize what he said, and once I got it, I started to laugh.</p><p>\u201cI hope that\u2019s not a pick-up line.\u201d Looking around, I noticed a lot of people were watching us.</p> <p>\u201cDo you live around here?\u201d He pulled my chin in his direction, forcing my eyes back to him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I go to school here.\u201d He nodded, biting his lip.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...Lilly. Yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like a Lilly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He chuckled, taking a piece of my hair and tucking it behind my ear. \u201cI\u2019m Cash.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows drew together. \u201cIs that a nickname?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNah, Ma named me Cash, after Johnny Cash.\u201d His hand came up again, this time to run along my jaw. I thought it was odd that he kept touching me, but I couldn\u2019t find it in myself to tell him to stop. \u201cSo, I\u2019m going to need your number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I need to call you to make sure that you haven\u2019t got a concussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m okay.\u201d I laughed, looking over at the guy he came in with. He was looking down at his phone, smiling.</p><p>\u201cHere, come meet my brother.\u201d He didn\u2019t give me a chance to say no; he grabbed my hand, dragging me with him to where his brother was standing.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that smile for?\u201d Cash asked his brother, who finally looked up from his phone. I had no idea what these guys\u2019 parents looked like, but good Lord, they were seriously hot.</p><p>\u201cNothing, Liz messaged me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Lilly. Lilly, this is one of my brothers, Trevor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d his brother said with a slight smile, but I couldn\u2019t think of anything except the way Cash\u2019s hand felt against my lower back.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I took a breath, trying to get a grip. \u201cUm, I need to go. It was nice meeting you both. Again, I'm really sorry about the coffee and the head-butt.\u201d They both laughed at the same time.</p><p>Cash\u2019s fingers grabbed onto the back of my sweater, holding me in place. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll walk you out.\u201d Trevor handed me back my coffee. I gave him a small nod, leaving the shop with Cash. Once we were outside, he let go of my sweater, grabbing my hand. I didn\u2019t know how to react to this kind of attention. It felt like a hive-full of honeybees had taken flight inside my stomach. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you have a phone?\u201d he asked, his body so close I could smell the light scent of his cologne. He smelled like the outdoors and sunshine, the warmth of his body absorbing into mine. I felt inside my sweater pocket, pulling out my phone. I couldn\u2019t find my words because he was standing so close. His fingers slid my phone from my hand, his touch tingling through my system like a hot-wired fence. He started dialing a few numbers before his phone started ringing from his pocket. \u201cNow I can make sure you ain\u2019t got a concussion.\u201d He smiled, showing off two dimples. I couldn\u2019t help but smile back.</p><p>Shaking my head, I cleared my throat. \u201cIt was nice meeting you, Cash.\u201d I took a step back, seeing his brother stepping out of the coffee shop and holding two coffees.</p><p>\u201cTalk to you soon.\u201d He looked like he wanted to say something else, but he stopped himself. I turned and walked back to my apartment. A few seconds later, my phone buzzed in my pocket.</p><p>Unknown: Let me know that you got home, okay? Don\u2019t want to worry about you having a concussion.</p> <p>I looked over my shoulder, smiling and shaking my head before I turned around, heading to my apartment. After saving his number with his name, I messaged him back.</p><p>Me: Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m hard-headed.</p><p>When I got home, I tossed my sweater onto the back of the couch, plopped down, and leaned my head back. I thought about the last thirty minutes until my phone beeped again. My pulse sped up when I saw the name.</p><p>Cash: Are you home?</p><p>I looked around my small apartment before replying: Yeah, just got in.</p> <p>Cash: Call you tonight when I get home.</p><p>Me: Where do you call home?</p><p>Cash: A small town in Tennessee, a little over two hours away from you.</p><p>My stomach dropped. That was really far, way too far to have any kind of relationship. Not that that\u2019s what he wanted, or even what I wanted for that matter. I didn\u2019t even own a car. I was in college on a full scholarship; I couldn\u2019t even afford to eat anything that wasn\u2019t microwavable.</p><p>Cash: Well, talk soon.</p><p>I looked at the phone in my hand for a second before replying: Sure, talk to you then.</p> <p>I turned my phone on silent; I needed to get back to studying. The last thing I needed was to spend my day daydreaming about a blue-eyed, brown-haired guy with dimples.</p><p>Three weeks later</p><p>Lilly</p><p>I was ready. I looked myself over in the mirror; my cream-colored skin had darkened with the Alabama sun, making my hazel eyes look more green than brown. I had applied a thick coat of mascara, along with some blush. My red hair was curled into waves, the sides pulled back into a clip. I had on my favorite pair of dark skinny jeans, black sandals, and a black tube top. \u201cYou can do this,\u201d I told my reflection. It had been three weeks since I last saw Cash in person. Three weeks of phone calls and texting, and now he would be here any minute.</p><p>I was nervous and excited about seeing him again. I had learned a lot about him over the last few weeks. He came from a close family. He had three brothers. His mom and dad were still married, and they were still very much in love, according to him. He also had a niece who he adored, and another one on the way. His brothers and he owned their own business. He owned his own home, and he was working on fixing it up. The doorbell went off, making me jump. I looked in the mirror one last time before shutting off the bathroom light. The doorbell went off again just as I pulled the door open. I was unsure why I was caught off-guard. He wore a gray t-shirt, jeans, and boots. His hair, like the last time I saw him, was a little long and sticking out around the baseball cap he wore. His eyes darkened slightly as they roamed over me before landing on my face. I swallowed and took a deep breath, my fingers digging into the wood of the door. \u201cHi.\u201d At the sound of my voice, he stepped into my apartment, his arms wrapping around my waist. His face went to my neck, and my arms hung at my sides for a second before going around his back, holding onto him.</p><p>\u201cYou smell so f**king good.\u201d His voice was a soft rumble against my skin, making my pulse speed up and causing the place between my legs to tingle.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I smiled, enjoying the feeling of being in his arms. I had forgotten the way he smelled, and how big he was compared to me. His head came up, his hands running up my arms to my shoulders and under my jaw.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to go?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded; my mouth had gone dry with him standing so close. I felt overwhelmed. He had to be one of the most attractive men I had ever seen. He looked like a hot baseball player because of his hat, just more bulky. \u201cSo, what are we doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured we could go to dinner and catch a movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good. Just let me get my bag.\u201d I stepped out of his embrace and walked down the short hall to my kitchen, grabbing my bag off the counter. I checked to make sure I had my phone. Cash was still standing near the door; he was looking over the photos hanging on the wall.</p><p>\u201cAre those your parents?\u201d He pointed to a picture of my mom and dad standing in front of Childs Glacier in Alaska. My dad was holding my mom close, her head laying against his chest, looking at the camera. I took that picture right before I left for college.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s my mom and dad.\u201d I smiled. He looked at me, then back to the photo.</p><p>\u201cYou look like your mom. Just the hair is different.\u201d I reached up, automatically touching my hair.</p><p>\u201cSince I was old enough to go to the drug store on my own, I have been changing it.\u201d I smiled at the memory of the first time I got my hands on a box of hair color. \u201cThe first time I colored it, my parents came home to find me with black hair. It wouldn\u2019t have been so bad if the towels, my hands, and the bathroom weren\u2019t also black.\u201d I laughed. \u201cMy dad says he can tell what kind of mood I am in based on my hair color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what does the red say about your mood?\u201d He reached out, running his fingers through it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t redheads known to be wild?\u201d He smirked.</p><p>\u201cUm...I...\u201d I could feel my cheeks heat up.</p><p>\u201cOr was it that they have fiery tempers?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t think the color of your hair has anything to do with your temper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the day in the caf\u00e9\u2014your temper then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were annoying.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, taking a step back. \u201cI was letting you know I was interested.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows drew together. \u201cBy pushing your way into buying coffee for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was being nice.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, the gesture was nice, I agree, but your execution was horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I was off my game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you do? I mean, do you often try to hit on women in coffee shops by buying coffee for them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell you with one-hundred percent truthfulness that I had never done that before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever?\u201d I asked. He shook his head. A look passed over his face. I don\u2019t know what it meant, but I didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cDo you date a lot?\u201d I asked quietly, wondering if he thought I would just be some kind of conquest.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t dated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t dated?\u201d I looked him over again. He must have thought I was stupid. Guys who looked like him must date a lot.</p><p>\u201cI have never had to date.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I want to sleep with someone, I don\u2019t need to date them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I breathed; that is not at all what I expected him to say. \u201cYou\u2019re the guy who can get any girl he wants without ever putting any kind of effort into it.\u201d He shrugs; the gesture made me feel sick, and at the same time, I wanted to kick him in the nuts. Maybe the red hair did make me have a temper.</p><p>\u201cI never lead anyone on, or tell them things they want to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that makes it okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it makes it okay, but it\u2019s who I am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I am glad that this is coming to light now, rather than later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d he shook his head, \u201cthis thing with you is something completely different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d I told him, crossing my arms over my chest. \u201cIt\u2019s different because I will not be sleeping with you.\u201d I leaned forward. \u201cEVER.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess we answered the question about redheads and their tempers, didn\u2019t we?\u201d He smiled, showing off both dimples. \u201cBut trust me when I tell you, I would not have driven almost three hours just to sleep with you; that\u2019s not what I am looking for.\u201d</p><p>My pulse sped up when he repeated what he said earlier, \u201cThis thing with you is something different, something I\u2019m looking forward to exploring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can be friends, but that\u2019s it. I will never be some guy\u2019s passing conquest, or a notch on a bed post.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I ask you to sleep with me?\u201d He smirked again. He didn\u2019t, but I saw guys like him all the time around campus, and I had avoided each and every one of them. \u201cWhen we do sleep together, it will mean something to the both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you not hear what I said earlier?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI heard you. I also know you should never say never.\u201d He looked at me like he knew something I didn\u2019t, making me feel uneasy. \u201cYou ready to go?\u201d</p><p>I was not ready. In fact, I was sure I\u2019d made a huge mistake. My brain was going a million miles an hour, trying to figure out what the hell was going on. He held out his hand to me, and I looked down at it. He had nice hands; they were large and masculine, and his fingers were long. But I felt like this was some kind of test, one that I hadn\u2019t prepared for.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d his fingers went to my chin, lifting my eyes to his, \u201cwe can take this slowly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d I asked. His eyes went warm, making my pulse speed up.</p><p>\u201cThis...is the beginning of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a vampire or something?\u201d I half-joked. He looked at me possessively, making me feel warm. He started to laugh, his head thrown back, showing off his square jaw. When he lowered his head to look at me, he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, not a vampire. I just know what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kinda freaking me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoin the club,\u201d he said under his breath, as he turned to open the door to my apartment. He held it open for me to step out. Once I was in the hall, I turned to lock the door behind me. He took my hand into his; his palm was slightly callused, and I wondered what they would feel like running over my body. The thought caught me off-guard. I grew up in a very small town in Alaska\u2014my graduating class was thirty-five people. I had one boyfriend when I was sixteen, and all we ever did was kiss. For me, the only reason we even did that was because it was what you did when you had a boyfriend. I had no idea what to do with the feelings of lust Cash brought out in me.</p><p>I took a few deep breaths, trying to calm my nerves. The feelings of nervousness completely disappeared when we got out into the parking lot and stopped at the side of a large red truck. He opened the door, and when I went to get in, I realized there was no step-thingy and no handle to grab onto in order to swing myself inside. I turned to look at Cash, who was smiling.</p><p>\u201cHow am I going to get up there?\u201d I hitched my thumb in the direction of the cab of the truck. His smile grew bigger; he took a step towards me, his hands going to my waist. He gave a slight squeeze before I was lifted up. My hands shot out, grabbing onto his shoulders; the position reminded me of Dirty Dancing when Patrick Swayze picked up Jennifer Grey when they were practicing on the log in the rain. Our eyes were locked, and I had never in my life wanted to kiss someone more than I did in that moment. He sat me down in the seat; his eyes dropped to my mouth, and then came back to mine.</p><p>He tilted his head towards his shoulder. \u201cYou can let go now.\u201d His voice was slightly rough; I moved my hands quickly and turned my legs into the cab of the truck, placing my hands in my lap and noticing they were shaking.</p><p>Three months later</p><p>\u201cI hate leaving you here. I hate I have to be without you,\u201d Cash said quietly. We were lying in bed. Cash had just made love to me, and it was more beautiful than I ever thought it would be. He was so gentle with me. Well, I guess he was always gentle with me. It was something else\u2014it was like in that moment, we were one, and not just in a sexual way. It was something different. I knew we loved each other\u2014he told me he loved me all the time\u2014but now feeling it, knowing he was my first, and that I had given him a piece of myself that I could never get back...it connected me to him in a way that made it even more perfect. I cuddled closer to him, his hand running lazily down my side to my hip. My hand pressed to his chest.</p><p>\u201cI hate it too,\u201d I told him, lifting my head, my chin going to his chest, and our eyes meeting. I searched his face, wondering what he\u2019d think about me moving to Tennessee and going to college closer to him. I wanted to be with him all the time. I wouldn\u2019t have moved in with him or anything crazy like that, but if I could be a thirty-minute drive instead of a three-hour drive, I would have loved that. I hated that I could only see him on the weekends. And I didn\u2019t like that he had to travel so far to come see me. I was just about to say it when I realized that it would be stupid. It was too soon. I just gave him my virginity; we weren\u2019t getting married or anything. Maybe if things kept on like they were, then I would see what he\u2019d say about me moving closer. I came back to myself when his hands touched my face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d His fingers trailed from my temple to my bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cNothing, just thinking that my never didn\u2019t really work out, did it?\u201d I smiled and laughed, thinking about the fact that on our first date I\u2019d told him that I would never ever sleep with him.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I will cherish what you gave me for the rest of my life,\u201d he told me, making my tummy flip. The look in his eyes was so sincere that I held my breath. He leaned forward, his mouth opening over mine.</p><p>Cash</p> <p>I pulled up in front of my house and shut off my car. I hopped out, opened the trunk, and pulled out my overnight bag. When I got inside, I tossed my bag into the laundry room, went into the kitchen, pulled a beer out of the fridge, and popped the tab, taking a deep drink. I pulled off my baseball cap, tossing it on the counter and ran my hand through my hair. I wanted to call Lilly and hear her voice again; we talked my whole drive home, but it wasn\u2019t enough. I needed more. I looked around, seeing my space, wondering what she\u2019d think of it. I wanted her here with me. I hated knowing I couldn\u2019t see her whenever I wanted. I wanted to ask her to move closer, or just move in with me, but I knew it would be way too soon, so I held my tongue. I used to give Asher and Trevor a hard time about the way they acted when they both met their one...now I knew. I would die for Lilly; she was amazing, beautiful, and kind, and made me want to be a better person.</p><p>My phone rang from my pocket, bringing me out of my thoughts. I pulled it out, expecting it to be Lilly. The number was unknown. I answered, and just like that, with one phone call, my life changed.</p><p>Lilly</p><p>\u201cI love you, but I can\u2019t see you anymore.\u201d The words played over and over in my head. I could feel his pain, but didn\u2019t understand it. I felt like my own chest was cracking open. He told me he loved me. He told me I was the one. Oh, God, I was going to be sick. I ran into the bathroom, the contents of my lunch coming up. Once I finished, I flushed the toilet, resting my cheek on the bathroom floor, not caring that it was probably dirty. I didn\u2019t care about anything; I just wanted to sleep. I didn\u2019t want to feel anything. I shut my eyes, trying to forget the pain that was consuming me.</p><p>I opened my eyes, feeling disoriented. The room was completely dark, and when I sat up, I realized I had fallen asleep on the bathroom floor. I turned on the light and stripped off my clothes. I turned on the shower and climbed in before the water had a chance to heat up; the cold water jolted my system. My movements were automatic; I couldn\u2019t feel anything. I got out, wrapping a towel around myself before going to my room, climbing under the covers, and falling back to sleep.</p> <p>Over the next few weeks, I had a routine: class, eat, and sleep. I didn\u2019t do anything outside of my routine. I couldn\u2019t watch TV, and I couldn\u2019t spend too much time on campus\u2014any time I saw a couple, I would break down into tears, making me feel like a bigger loser than I already felt like. I was exhausted and sick; no matter how much I slept or what I ate, nothing changed. That was when I decided to go to the doctor, and for the second time in a few weeks, my life was turned upside-down.</p><p>\u201cI am pregnant?\u201d I asked for confirmation. The doctor looked at me over the top of his glasses, his eyes making me squirm.</p><p>\u201cYes, Ms. Donovan, that is what the urine test, blood test, and ultrasound all confirmed.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d So I wanted to be sure that they were not getting false results and may have gone a little overboard, but what the f**k? I never thought I would be pregnant, especially when I had only had sex one time, and used a condom when I\u2019d done it.</p><p>\u201cI am going to give you a number to a clinic where you can get this taken care of,\u201d the doctor said, making me feel somewhat better.</p><p>\u201cThat would be good.\u201d I knew I would need to see someone about getting vitamins and talk to someone about how sick I had been. And I would need to call Cash and let him know what was going on, even if we weren\u2019t together. I would never keep this from him.</p> <p>\u201cThe procedure takes a couple hours; you will need to have someone go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProcedure?\u201d I knew my face scrunched up in confusion.</p><p>\u201cThe abortion.\u201d My hands covered my stomach quickly. I never even thought about that; I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cNo, no way. I\u2019m not getting an abortion.\u201d I didn\u2019t see anything wrong with that choice for others, but for me, it wasn\u2019t an option.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mrs. Donovan, I thought we were talking about the same thing.\u201d I shook my head, tears pooling in my eyes. \u201cI will get you a number for an OB/GYN then.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I swiped at my eyes, and the first bit of warmth came into the doctor\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYou will be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I agreed. I had my parents; they never let me down. I could go home...and do what? Live with my parents? Have them support my baby and me? That wasn\u2019t an option. I would have to find a way to make it here. I would find a way to finish school, even if I had to do it online, and there were lots of single mothers in the world. I would just be one more. I would find a way to make it. Once the doctor finished and gave me the number for the OB/GYN, I left the office, making my way to the bus. I pulled out my phone, and for the first time in three weeks, I sent Cash a text.</p> <p>Me: We need to talk.</p><p>Cash: We have nothing to talk about.</p><p>My stomach dropped at his response. He was never short or mean to me. I couldn\u2019t understand what I had done.</p><p>Me: We do have something to talk about.</p><p>I felt my gut twist.</p><p>Cash: Get over it. We\u2019re done. Don\u2019t text me again.</p><p>My temper started to flare; I couldn\u2019t believe that he would do this to me.</p><p>Me: I am having your baby, you dick.</p><p>Cash: Get rid of it. I am having a baby with my soon-to-be wife.</p><p>I read the words, ran to the trashcan on the corner of the street, and lost it. I couldn\u2019t believe him! Who was this guy? A lady came over, offering me water and a napkin. I used it to wipe my mouth and thanked her for it. I looked down at the text, reading it again and again. I didn\u2019t even know how I got home; I just remembered climbing into bed, my hands going to my stomach. I looked up at the ceiling in my room, not really seeing anything, just replaying all the good times I had with Cash...all the firsts I had with him. I knew that no matter what, the child growing inside of me was made out of love. Even though his or her father didn\u2019t love me, I had loved him enough for the both of us.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Present Day</p><p>Cash</p><p>\u201cDaddy, are we there yet?\u201d Jax moans from the backseat, making me smile. If we\u2019re in the car for more than fifteen minutes, he is ready to bust out of his car seat. He has more energy than ten kids combined. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAbout fifteen more minutes, dude, then you can go wild.\u201d We are on our way to Jumping Bean, a giant warehouse full of trampolines. Hopefully by the time we leave, he will be worn out, and I can get some rest. I love my son, but damn if he doesn\u2019t wear me out.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna jump wiff me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d he yells, his little arms shooting straight up in the air. I turn up the volume to the show he\u2019s watching on the back of the passenger seat\u2019s headrest, hoping it will keep him occupied until we get to the warehouse. When I found out Jules was pregnant, I was pissed off at the world. I was in love with Lilly. I hated saying goodbye to her. I knew that in order to have a relationship with my child, to have him in my life, I had to cut her out and focus on Jules. After a year, I realized it would never happen. I was killing myself. I was miserable. Almost three years ago, we divorced, and she moved into an apartment in town. My son stays with me unless I\u2019m at work, then my mother, November, or Liz has him. His mother sees him if the mood strikes, which is rare and perfectly fine with me, but difficult for him.</p> <p>\u201cAre we there yet?\u201d I chuckle, shifting lanes as I exit the highway.</p><p>\u201cTwo minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is taking forebbbeerrr,\u201d he whines and sighs. I look at him through the rearview mirror. His head is resting on his fist, looking completely disgruntled.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d I point out the front window to the building ahead of us.</p><p>\u201cWe should moob here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you miss grandma?\u201d I pull into the parking lot and find a space to park.</p><p>\u201cWell, she could come, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think grandpa would like that, little guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEberyone could moob here.\u201d I shake my head, getting out of the truck. By the time I have his door open, he\u2019s unbuckled himself and launches his little body at me.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to go have some fun?\u201d I hold him upside-down, his giggling making me laugh.</p><p>\u201cYes-s-s-s-s,\u201d he screeches as I bounce him. I turn him upright, putting his baseball cap on his head \u2014like me, he always wears one. I grab his hand as we walk into the building. This place is insane! There are kids everywhere, running and screaming, chasing each other as we stop at the front counter to pay. \u201cI wanna go in there, Daddy.\u201d I look to see he\u2019s pointing at a giant pit full of foam blocks. I am sure it looks like a good time to a kid, but to me, as a parent, it looks like a petri dish. I am going to have to wash him down with Purell by the time this day is over.</p> <p>\u201cWe will.\u201d He nods in agreement. I pull off his hat, and we both take off our shoes before putting them in one of the cubbies that take up a long wall. When his shoes are off, my little dare devil takes a running start, jumping in full-speed head-first into the pit. I laugh, watching as he tries to right himself.</p><p>\u201cCome in, Daddy.\u201d He tries to wave, but he looks like a fish out of water flopping all over the place. I step into the pit and once I reach him, I lift him above my head and I toss him, making him laugh harder. He somehow manages to get his feet underneath himself and wades towards me, looking like he is fighting a hard current. \u201cLet\u2019s go ober there.\u201d He points to a large trampoline that is built into the floor before taking my hand, leading the way out of the pit. I don\u2019t know who is going to be more exhausted by the time this day is over. Actually I do, and I know it won\u2019t be him.</p><p>As soon as we\u2019re out of the pit, he takes off on a run before bouncing onto the trampoline. I stand off to the side, watching him with my arms crossed over my chest. I look to the left when I see a flash of red hair in my peripheral vision. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time my mind has played a trick on me, making me think I see Lilly when I don\u2019t. The woman has fuller hips then Lilly did, and her ass is round, making me want to slap it. Shit, I need to get laid. The thought leaves just as quickly as it comes. My focus is my son. My bachelor days are a long forgotten memory. Now, if I need to get off, I use Miss Right or Miss Left. I\u2019m just about to look away when the woman turns towards me, and I stop breathing. I swear to God, time stops. All I can do is stare at her. Her skin is still the color of cream; her red hair is long and hangs over her br**sts that seem to be larger than when I last had them in my hands. She looks even more beautiful, if that\u2019s possible. When her eyes meet mine, she blinks then pales, her hand covering her mouth. What the f**k?</p><p>\u201cMommy! Mommy!\u201d She looks down, and my stomach drops, seeing a little girl with dark hair pulled into two pigtails and skin the same color as her mom\u2019s. Lilly gets down to the little girl\u2019s level, pulling her close as she whispers something to her. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna weeb,\u201d she cries, her face turning towards me. For the second time in as many minutes, my world comes to a halt. She looks so much like Jax that they could be twins. I look up, my eyes meeting Lilly\u2019s again.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, come play with me.\u201d Jax grabs onto my pants leg. I look down at him, then back at Lilly as tears pool in her eyes. She picks up her daughter\u2014our daughter\u2014and starts to take a step away. Automatically, my hand reaches out to grab onto her elbow. I look down at Jax and give him a smile. \u201cYou go play, dude. I will be there in a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he grumbles before running off again. I look at the little girl in Lilly\u2019s arms; her eyes are on me as she leans in to whisper something into her mother\u2019s ear. Lilly closes her eyes, hugging her tighter before saying something back to her and setting her on the ground.</p><p>\u201cGo play for a minute, love bug,\u201d Lilly tells her. The little girl doesn\u2019t take her eyes off me. I want to pick her up and hold her so badly that my fists clench, fighting it. Lilly kisses her forehead before turning her towards the trampoline. I watch her walk away then start to bounce. It takes a second for my brain to start functioning.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my daughter.\u201d My blood starts to boil. She kept her from me.</p> <p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s my daughter.\u201d She takes a step to the side, away from the other adults around us. I follow, standing at an angle so I can watch my kids.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that you would keep my kid from me.\u201d I look her over, the feeling of hate consuming me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a piece of work, you know that? Your words were \u201cget rid of it\u201d, that you were getting married and having a baby with someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read those words over and over a hundred f**king times, so don\u2019t tell me that she\u2019s yours.\u201d She pokes my chest, getting in my space. \u201cShe is mine! I suffered from morning sickness alone. I went to my doctor\u2019s appointments alone. I was in labor for forty-seven hours. Alone. And I have raised her alone.\u201d She growls the last words. I have no idea what the f**k she is talking about. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI never told you to get rid of my child, so don\u2019t even try that shit with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, you did, buddy. I even have a print out of the text messages. I kept them as a reminder to myself to never trust a man again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the f**k you\u2019re talking about,\u201d I say, a sinking feeling taking over my body.</p><p>\u201cThe day I found out I was pregnant, I messaged you telling you we needed to talk. You said we had nothing to talk about. I told you I was having your child, and you told me to get rid of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, f**k.\u201d I rub my face, knowing this is all Jules. She did this; somehow, she did this. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201d My voice is gruff to my own ears. For the first time in years, I want to cry like a little bitch. She\u2019s watching me closely, her arms wrapped around her waist, her expression changing from anger to confusion and sadness. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d I ask, looking at my daughter, who is now talking to Jax. He grabs her hands, bouncing with her.</p><p>\u201cAshlyn Alexandra.\u201d This is killing me. She gave her a version of my middle name\u2014Alexander. I swallow the lump that is building in my throat. I look at Lilly.</p><p>\u201cI want it back.\u201d I don\u2019t even realize that I say the words out loud. Lilly is my one, and I lost her and I\u2019m going to get her back. I had wanted to search for Lilly a million times. I was so afraid she wouldn\u2019t want me back, accept Jax, or that she\u2019s moved on that I talked myself out of it every time. Now I wish I would have looked for her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her eyebrows draw together in confusion, the same way they used to when we were together, making her look adorable.</p><p>\u201cWe are going to have to figure out a way for me to be in her life, and for her to know her brother.\u201d I take a step towards Lilly. \u201cWhere are you living?\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes get big, and her breathing picks up. Fuck yeah! I still affect her. \u201cUm, we just moved to Springhill because I got a teaching job,\u201d she says quietly, looking at Ashlyn and then back at me.</p><p>\u201cGood, you\u2019re not far from me.\u201d She starts shaking her head. I bring my hand up, cupping her cheek. \u201cWe will figure out a time to meet. We have a lot to talk about, but right now, let\u2019s just have a good time. I don\u2019t want the kids to get freaked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshlyn is already freaked. She knows who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u2019</p><p>\u201cThe pictures we took with my cell phone, she has them, and she knows who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d I rub the back of my head. \u201cWhere did you say I was?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well,\u201d she pauses, clearing her throat, \u201cwe lived in Alaska near my parents up until a few months ago when I got the teaching job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you told her I lived in Tennessee?\u201d I look to where Jax and Ashlyn are laughing with their little legs moving rapidly as they bounce in place.</p><p>\u201cMy dad wanted me to tell her that you were dead, but I couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d she whispers, and my head swings back in her direction.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you try harder to get ahold of me?\u201d I rip my hand through my hair. This situation is completely f**ked up.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would I do that when you told me to have an abortion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t me,\u201d I growl.</p> <p>\u201cIt was your phone.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cSo you never got married?\u201d She rolls her eyes. \u201cObviously, you had a son.\u201d She points at Jax.</p><p>I did not want to answer that question. I knew the minute I told her I had been married that she wouldn\u2019t believe that I never told her to have an abortion. She must have read the look on my face. When she answers, her words are so soft and full of pain that I swear I can feel them cutting into my skin.</p><p>\u201cI already know you got married, so even without you answering that question, I still know.\u201d I see pain flash across her face. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to believe that what we had could be so easily replaced. I thought II had done something wrong, and you were upset. I thought you loved me. I was depressed and lonely, so I did a search of your name online, planning to come find you, and came across your wedding announcement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that is kinda how I felt.\u201d She gives a slight laugh, the kind that isn\u2019t humorous.</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry; you will never be on your own again,\u201d I tell her, taking a step towards her because I want to hold her. She takes a step back, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cWe can figure out a way for you to be in Ashlyn\u2019s life, but only if you plan on sticking around. I will not let her become attached to you, only to have you walk away without an explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never do that.\u201d I narrow my eyes and she raises her eyebrows, crossing her arms over her chest.</p><p>\u201cYou are the one who taught me the meaning of never say never, remember?\u201d she reminds me. I told her that when we first got together. She told me she wouldn\u2019t sleep with me ever, and I told her never say never. We only slept together one time. That one time had made me fall more in love with her than I already was. The day after, I had to come back home and go to work. I never knew that it would be the last time I would see Lilly. I knew then that she was the one for me, even as young as I was. I knew, and in the end I tossed her away, thinking I was doing the right thing, not knowing how sharp the double-edged sword was that I held in my hand.</p><p>We both stand there staring at each other. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s thinking, but I\u2019m thinking I want to kiss the f**k out of her, hold her, love her, and remind her of how good we were together. She looks away, then waves for Ashlyn to come to her. I watch my daughter bounce all the way over to where we\u2019re standing. She is so beautiful that my chest hurts just looking at her. I have loved every second of raising my son, and I hate that I have missed so much time with her. Jax comes along with Ashlyn. When she reaches where we\u2019re standing, her head goes way back, with her cute little face scrunching up.</p><p>\u201cAre you my daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s my daddy.\u201d Jax launches himself at me. Ashlyn looks at Jax, and then me. I drop to my knees in front of her, putting my arm around Jax\u2019s waist. I have no idea how to handle this right now, and my stomach starts to turn as my palms begin to sweat.</p><p>\u201cCome here, love bug.\u201d Lilly pulls Ashlyn into her arms.</p><p>\u201cDaddy.\u201d Jax puts his palm on my cheek, forcing my head to turn. \u201cWhy did that girl ask if you\u2019re her daddy?\u201d Leave it to my kid to get right to the point. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell...um.\u201d Fuck, why couldn\u2019t I think of what to say?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, honey?\u201d Lilly asks. I look up to see Ashlyn in her arms looking down at us.</p><p>\u201cJax.\u201d Lilly smiles so brightly her whole face lights up. I forgot that smile. How the f**k did I forget that smile?</p><p>\u201cVery cool name.\u201d Jax\u2019s chest puffs out under her praise.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be big like my daddy,\u201d he informs her randomly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are, honey.\u201d Lilly smiles again. \u201cHow would you feel about having a playdate with Ashlyn sometime?\u201d Jax shrugs. I look at Ashlyn who smiles. \u201cSure, she could come to my house. I have a ferret and a tree house!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she would like that. Though, I'm not sure what a ferret is.\u201d Jax laughs and so does Ashlyn. I can\u2019t believe how much they look alike. \u201cI\u2019m going to get your dad\u2019s number, and we can set up a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d Jax yells, jumping up and down.</p><p>\u201cWill you do me a favor, Jax?\u201d He nods. \u201cTake Ashlyn over to get her shoes while I get your dad\u2019s number, okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he agrees right away. Lilly sets Ashlyn down. She hasn\u2019t taken her eyes off me. Jax takes her hand, pulling her along. I watch as she shows him where her shoes are. They are too high for her to reach, so he gets them for her, and then runs and grabs his before sitting next to her on the ground.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s best if we talk to them separately about what\u2019s going on. Jax is going to be very confused about this, and Ashlyn isn\u2019t going to be much better. She knows of you, but doesn\u2019t know you. I think we should set up a time for you to come alone and spend some time with her. Then bring Jax along later so they can get to know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you acting so cool about all of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess I will save my breakdown for tonight when Ashlyn is in bed, and I can have a glass of wine.\u201d She pulls out her cell phone from her back pocket, sliding a finger across the screen. \u201cSo what\u2019s your number?\u201d I rattle it off, watching as she types in the numbers. My phone starts ringing from my pocket. I pull it out and save her number quickly. She turns her back on me, walking to where the kids are sitting. She runs her hand over Jax\u2019s hair before grabbing her shoes. She bends over, putting them on with her round ass in the air. I look around when I feel a sting against my skin, my eyes landing on a guy who is looking at her ass with his wife or girlfriend standing right next to him. I walk up to where Lilly is bent over, not taking my eyes off the guy who is watching her. When I get there, the guy\u2019s eyes come to me, and I give him a chin lift. He looks away quickly, making me feel somewhat better. I still have the urge to shove a foam block down his throat. When Lilly finally stands, I grab my hat after pulling on my sneakers. I put my hat on, shoving my hand in my pocket so I can grab my keys. I turn around to see Lilly looking at me funny, Jax holding one of her hands and Ashlyn holding the other. My heart squeezes at the sight of them together. She blinks, shaking her head. \u201cYou ready?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Lilly nods. Jax lets go of her hand and runs to me, grabbing mine. We wait and hold open the door for the girls.</p><p>\u201cYour hair is really red,\u201d Jax says, looking at Lilly. She laughs, shaking her head. The sun is out, beaming down on her, making her red hair shine more brightly and giving her a glow.</p> <p>\u201cShe just colored it. It was brown before,\u201d Ashlyn informs us, making me laugh as I think about the last time I saw her; her hair was the same color it is now, only a lot shorter. We walk out to the parking lot, and Lilly stops at a small, piece-of-shit car. It was probably silver at one time, but is now grey and dull, with rust spots and dents. She opens the back door, and Ashlyn crawls inside. I don\u2019t like this. My body is fighting itself, not wanting them out of my sight.</p><p>\u201cSo I will call and set up a time with you,\u201d she says, watching Ashlyn buckle her seatbelt.</p><p>\u201cCall me when you get home,\u201d I tell her, my voice rough with anger, not at her, but myself.</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll call you in a couple days after you have had some time to think about this.\u201d I take a step towards her, getting in her space.</p><p>\u201cI am not going to change my mind,\u201d I growl the words, making her eyes widen slightly.</p><p>Then she takes a breath. \u201cWell, then call when you\u2019re ready,\u201d she says quietly before squatting down to Jax\u2019s level.</p><p>\u201cIt was very nice to meet you, Jax.\u201d She holds out her hand for a shake.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty, like my mom.\u201d Jax is wrong. Jules is pretty, but so rotten on the inside that it started seeping out, making a once pretty girl ugly. Now, Lilly\u2014Lilly is more than beautiful, and if the situation between us hadn\u2019t made her bitter, then nothing ever would. And I could see her light shine through every time she looked at our daughter.</p> <p>\u201cWell, thank you, honey.\u201d She gives a small smile before standing back up and opening her door. I lean in the back door so I can talk to Ashlyn.</p><p>\u201cI will see you soon, okay?\u201d She nods. Her eyes are big and the same color as mine.</p><p>\u201cSo are you my daddy?\u201d she asks more quietly this time.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whisper, running my hand over her hair.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come see me?\u201d Oh God, this is killing me. I have no idea how to explain this to her. I don\u2019t even know how to explain this to myself.</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry, baby.\u201d The words choke out. \u201cI promise you that I will come see you now, every chance I get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandpa says that you hab to keep your promises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is right.\u201d I smile at the way she pronounces her v\u2019s the same way as Jax. \u201cYou do have to keep your promises.\u201d She nods in agreement. \u201cI\u2019ll call your mommy later and say goodnight to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She reaches over, grabbing a small doll and holds it in her lap. I lean in a little, kissing the top of her head. I get out of the car and see that Lilly and Jax are talking.</p><p>\u201cYou ready, little dude?\u201d I look down at Jax, who is watching Ashlyn curiously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always hungry.\u201d I laugh, watching Lilly get in the car. She shuts the door, turning her car on before rolling down the window.</p><p>\u201cGrandma says I\u2019m growing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are. Soon you\u2019re going to be taller than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d His face lights up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut you have to eat your vegetables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be as tall as you then,\u201d he grumbles, and I pick him up, tossing him over my shoulder chuckling.</p><p>\u201cSure you do.\u201d I look at Lilly, who is watching me with a small smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk soon.\u201d She nods. \u201cCall me when you get home,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cCash\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLilly, call me when you get home,\u201d I say it a little more slowly so she knows I am not f**king around.

Call me.\u201d Her eyes flash like they used to when we were a couple and her temper would flare. I used to love when it happened. I would kiss her until she melted into me and couldn\u2019t remember why she was mad.</p><p>\u201cFine, I will call you.\u201d She rolls her eyes, making me want to fist her hair and put my mouth on hers.</p><p>\u201cSay bye, love bug.\u201d Ashlyn waves from the backseat and Lilly from the front as I set Jax down next to me. We watch Lilly and Ashlyn pull out of the parking lot. I don\u2019t like the feelings coursing through me. I don\u2019t like them driving away, and I don\u2019t like the amount of hate I am feeling towards Jules. I didn\u2019t think I could hate her more than I did, but she\u2019s proven me wrong. I need to call my brothers. I need to talk to them and have a beer.</p> <p>\u201cHow about we stop at Grandma\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Jax shrugs. I can tell he\u2019s getting tired and will most likely be asleep by the time we hit the highway. After I get Jax in the car and buckled in, I hop behind the wheel and send a text to each of my brothers, telling them to meet me at the barn in an hour. I can\u2019t believe Jules told Lilly to get an abortion. The whole time she was pregnant, she\u2019d threatened to have one if I didn\u2019t do exactly what she wanted. I shake my head and put my truck in reverse, stare at myself in the mirror, and notice my hat. It\u2019s the same hat Lilly gave me when we were dating; I haven\u2019t stopped wearing it since then. I head out of the parking lot wondering if this is my time, if I\u2019m finally going to have a chance to be happy again.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Lilly</p><p>What the hell just happened? I look in the rearview mirror to see Ashlyn trying to see out the back window. I never in a million years thought I would see Cash again, let alone see him when I have Ashlyn with me and he has his son. I want to puke. He had asked why I was being so cool about this; honestly, I might have been cool on the outside, but on the inside, I was freaking right the f**k out. All I\u2019d wanted to do was pick Ashlyn up, run out of there, and get as far away from him as I could.</p><p>\u201cMommy, was that really my daddy?\u201d Oh, God, I never thought I would be having this conversation. I considered that maybe when she got older she might look for him, but I never thought that I would have to find a way to explain to my almost-three-year-old something that I didn\u2019t even understand.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, love, that was your daddy.\u201d I silently pray that she falls asleep and doesn\u2019t have any more questions. Hell, this would be so much easier if she was still a baby. She doesn\u2019t say anything else the whole way home. My mind is going over millions of scenarios, some of them involving packing up and taking off back to Alaska to the comfort of my parents, but I know I can\u2019t do that. The look on Cash\u2019s face when he saw Ashlyn and realized who she is was , just broke my heart. And then, when I looked in his eyes when he told me that he didn\u2019t send those messages, all I saw was honesty. He didn\u2019t want to admit he was married, I remind myself.</p><p>When I pull up in front of our apartment building, I look back and see Ashlyn asleep. I grab our bags and unhook her, pulling her out of the car. I slam the door and make my way up the two sets of outside stairs, and once I reach the door, I juggle her and our bags so that we can get inside. The first thing I do is drop our bags to the floor and go lay her down in her bed, pulling off her shoes and making sure her doll is where she can see it when she wakes up. I pull a blanket over her and make my way to the kitchen, where I pull out a bottle of moscato from my fridge, pop the cork, and fill my wine glass half-full. I down the contents, then refill the glass.</p><p>I walk to the living room and sit down on my secondhand couch, looking around our small two-bedroom apartment. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s what I could afford from the money I saved working over the past few summers in a fish processing plant. Most of our furniture is used, but in good condition; the only things that I bought new were our beds. When we moved from Alaska, I didn\u2019t want to pay for shipping everything, so we came with our clothes and what could fit in suitcases. I wonder what Cash will say about our home. My stomach starts to turn when thoughts of him trying to take Ashlyn from me fill my head. My phone starts ringing from my bag on the floor. I unfold myself from the couch, pick up my bag and digging to the bottom for my phone, but by the time I find it, it has stopped ringing. I flip it over in my hand, seeing Cash\u2019s name along with the words Missed Call.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I whisper, fumbling with the phone when it starts ringing again. I drop it to the floor, forgetting I have a glass of wine in my hand, so when I bend over to pick it up, I dump the glass of wine all over it. I shake as much of the wine off as I can, then start franticly wiping it on my jeans. The phone goes silent for a second before ringing again, and I slide my finger across the screen, hoping that it will work.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you home?\u201d Cash growls down the line. I look around for a second before answering him.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called and you didn\u2019t answer, and I told you to call me when you got home.\u201d I roll my eyes and take a breath.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I had to put Ashlyn to bed because she fell asleep in the car. Then I had to have a glass of wine. Then you called and I spilt said wine all over my phone, so I am so sorry if I didn\u2019t call or answer you fast enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had to have a glass of wine? And you spilt it all over your phone?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cUm...yes. I definitely had to have a glass of wine,\u201d I tell him truthfully, ignoring the part about spilling my wine. I have always been clumsy. \u201cThere is only so much stress a girl can take. And it\u2019s either wine or shopping, and since I am a single mother and can\u2019t afford to shop my stress away, I had to have a glass of wine.\u201d I realize I\u2019m rambling and squeeze my eyes closed, my head falling back and hitting the wall. I hear him laughing; my eyes fly open and I remember that he used to always laugh at everything I said. In Alaska, I\u2019d hated that I still loved the memory of the sound of his laughter; part of me still wants to hate him, but I just can\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the call dropped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, it didn\u2019t,\u201d I say like an idiot; obviously, he knows the call didn\u2019t drop.</p> <p>\u201cSo I...\u201d He pauses, and I can picture him running his hand through his hair the way he always used to when he wanted to say something but didn\u2019t know how to say it. \u201cI talked to my mom, and she will watch Jax tomorrow so I can come up and see you and Ashlyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the weekend off, so we will be home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, good,\u201d he says, and I can hear the nervousness in his voice. \u201cDid you talk to her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I will. It\u2019s just she fell asleep in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Jax fell asleep too,\u201d he sighs.</p><p>\u201cThis is really awkward,\u201d I laugh.</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d I have the urge to ask him about his wife, but can\u2019t spit the words out. The thought of him married makes me ill. Why did he still have to be so gorgeous? With his overgrown dark hair, crystal-clear blue eyes, tan skin, strong jaw, his height and body\u2014geez, his body is as perfect as I remember\u2014wearing dark jeans that fit just right, and a red t-shirt that was so tight I could see everything. \u201cSo I was thinking that I would come up around ten; does that work for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I hear the words, but they don\u2019t register for a second because I am stuck in a daydream about his body. Maybe it\u2019s time to start dating.</p><p>\u201cTen in the morning...does that work for you?\u201d I can hear the smile in his voice, and I shake myself out of my daydream.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, sure. Ten is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, I told Ashlyn I would talk to her tonight before she goes to bed. Can you have her call me when she wakes up from her nap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, no problem.\u201d I close my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI am glad you don\u2019t hate me,\u201d he whispers, the words sounding pained. My eyes open.</p><p>\u201cI want to.\u201d I really do. I want to rage and scream and cry, but I just can\u2019t. I feel like this isn\u2019t really happening.</p><p>\u201cI have a lot to explain. I just...damn, this situation is completely f**ked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, we will just talk tomorrow or whenever. I will have Ashlyn call you tonight. I just...I just need to know that you plan on sticking around; otherwise, I won\u2019t put her through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you already I won\u2019t change my mind. I have already missed out on way too much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right, so let me give you my address.\u201d I rattle it off to him quickly. \u201cSee you tomorrow,\u201d I say, and before he can say anything more, I hang up. I pull the phone from my ear and it starts ringing again right away; this time my mom\u2019s number is flashing across the screen.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom.\u201d I try to sound cheerful.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Dammit, I didn\u2019t want to have to tell her this. I moved home shortly after I had Ashlyn. I tried to make it on my own, but with a new baby, school, a job, and an apartment, it was just too difficult. My dad was ready to fly down and kill Cash, and my mom wasn\u2019t much better.</p><p>\u201cIranintoAshlyn\u2019sdadtoday,andshewaswithme,\u201d I say as quickly as verbally possible.</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d she screeches.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Mom, I don\u2019t know. I took Ashlyn to the place she likes with all the trampolines and he was there with his son. I tried to leave and he stopped me. He knew right away that Ashlyn was his, and I swear, Mom, I swear he acted like he had no idea what I was talking about when I told him about the messages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I sigh, sitting down on the couch.</p><p>\u201cHoney, that prick told you to get rid of my granddaughter. He doesn\u2019t get to come in now, filling your head with a bunch of bull-hocky, making you believe that he never told you those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Mom, but what if he didn\u2019t do it? I can\u2019t keep Ashlyn away from him; she knew right away who he was. If he really does want to be in her life, I can\u2019t keep him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a 12-gauge that says different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s illegal, and I kinda love you, so I would hate to see you in jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, just,\u201d she pauses, \u201cjust promise me that you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d I had not a clue what I was doing.</p><p>\u201cI am thinking of Ashlyn, Mom. That\u2019s my one thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is my grandbaby taking this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t really talked to her about it yet. She fell asleep in the car on the way home. I have no idea how to explain this to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she lets out a long breath, \u201cdon\u2019t start off by saying that her dad is a good for nothing ass**le.\u201d I laugh. I can\u2019t help it; my mom is funny.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sound advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell her that he is ready to get to know her\u2014that he missed her and is glad that you moved close so that they can see each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s even better advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, kiddo, you know I love you, and you know if you need anything\u2014even an alibi\u2014me and your dad will be here for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom. I love you,\u201d I whisper, laying down on the couch. \u201cTell Daddy I love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, honey. If you need us, you call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, Mom. Don\u2019t worry about me; everything will be all right.\u201d I hang up, staring at the ceiling, knowing I need to get up, but I don\u2019t move until I see Ashlyn standing in the hall rubbing her eyes. I call her over, pulling her into my lap. I explain as best as I can about Cash and why he wasn\u2019t around before, and how that was now going to change. Then I tell her about him coming over the next day, and she is very excited about that. My dad was the only man who she\u2019s had in her life, so having her dad would be huge for her. After Cash, I only dated one guy. He was sweet and good friends with my dad. We didn\u2019t get serious\u2014I wasn\u2019t ready for that. When I got the job here in Tennessee, he was a little upset I was leaving, but understood why. Plus I never wanted to feel the loss of someone that I loved again like I felt when Cash left me. So it was easier to get out before we got too involved.</p><p>Ashlyn jumped off my lap and ran to her room, yelling over her shoulder that she wanted it to be perfect for when her daddy came to play tomorrow. I snorted to myself; maybe there was a bright side to this after all.</p><p>Cash </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I turn, looking at Asher as he walks through the door. The last time I called a meeting at the barn was the day I broke up with Lilly and my life changed forever. I can\u2019t help thinking that this time the meeting is no less serious but I am praying that the outcome will lead me to my own happiness.</p><p>\u201cNo clue,\u201d Nico says, frowning down at his phone.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d Trevor asks Nico, who puts his cell phone away before sitting back in his chair.</p><p>\u201cWork stuff.\u201d He shrugs before looking at me. \u201cSo why are we here?\u201d he asks. Since he started working for Kenton, his whole persona has changed. There is an edge to him that wasn\u2019t there before. Now, he doesn\u2019t just look like a bad ass with tattoos; he is a badass with tattoos.</p> <p>\u201cI saw Lilly today,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, right?\u201d Trevor says, looking slightly confused.</p><p>\u201cWell, she has a daughter.\u201d I clear my throat, running my hand down the back of my neck. \u201cI...have a daughter,\u201d I say the words that I still can\u2019t believe myself.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you have a daughter?\u201d Asher asks.</p><p>\u201cSeems that when we were together, she got pregnant. I didn\u2019t know this, and she says that she tried to tell me, but someone sent her messages from my phone telling her to get an abortion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Trevor asks loudly.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know what the f**k happened.\u201d I scrub my hands down my face. The image of Lilly and the look of pain in her eyes feels like a weight against my chest. \u201cAll I can think is that Jules somehow got my phone and told her. She also told her that we were getting married, and this was long before I had even agreed to marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, what the f**k?\u201d Nico growls, and I look at him. \u201cSo why didn\u2019t Lilly try harder to contact you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe Googled me at some point and saw my wedding announcement. That, coupled with the fact that I had supposedly told her to have an abortion was the final straw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have a daughter with Lilly, and what, she finally called you after all these years asking you for support or something?\u201d Nico asks.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, I took Jax to Jumping Bean in Nashville and saw her there. When she saw me, she looked surprised, then a little girl came up to her calling her Mommy. The little girl knew exactly who I was when she saw me, and asked me if I was her daddy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, her name is Ashlyn Alexandra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d Asher whispers.</p><p>\u201cShe is beautiful, and could be Jax\u2019s twin,\u201d I continue.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet to know my daughter...and get my girl back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, the last time that you came to us with a problem, you ended up married to Jules, who, by the way, is a f**king bitch to end all bitches,\u201d Nico says, standing.</p><p>\u201cLook, I am going to bring her to Mom and Dad\u2019s this weekend. You will all see for yourselves the kind of person she is.\u201d Nico shakes his head, walking to the door. He has seen all the damage that Jules as has caused, and how much I\u2019ve had to do in order to protect my son from her insanity.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, I get that you want to get to know your daughter, but dude, no way should you try to get back with your ex. You have enough problems already,\u201d Nico says. I look at Trevor; he is the only one who knows that Lilly was mine. She is my one, and I gave her up thinking I was doing the right thing, Not that I regret for one second what I went through. If I didn\u2019t do what I did, Jax more than likely wouldn\u2019t be here, and I cannot imagine life without him.</p><p>\u201cLilly was my one\u2014is my one,\u201d I state firmly, watching Nico\u2019s face fall. He rubs his forehead.</p><p>\u201cFuck me. I guess I will see you guys this weekend then.\u201d With that, he lifts his chin and is out the door.</p><p>\u201cHave you explained what\u2019s going on to Jax?\u201d Trevor asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I talked to him about it. Well, I tried; he doesn\u2019t quite understand what\u2019s going on, but he knows that Ashlyn is his sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is like a bad soap opera,\u201d Asher says, standing. \u201cBut I gotta say that if things work out, I will be happy for you, brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say, and he pats me on the back before walking out the door. I look over at Trevor, who is still sitting with his elbows on his knees.</p><p>\u201cSo...when is she moving in?\u201d He smiles, and I can\u2019t help but smile back.</p><p>\u201cNot sure. I hope it will be soon, but it\u2019s a little harder than your or Asher\u2019s situations. We have to think about Jax and Ashlyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want some advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something Asher told me when I was starting out with Liz.\u201d My eyebrows draw together.</p><p>\u201cPush her,\u201d he says, nodding his head like he just told me where to find a million dollars.</p><p>\u201cPush her? That\u2019s your advice?\u201d I ask, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cYep, if she\u2019s yours, it will work out. Push her into a corner so she doesn\u2019t have a chance to retreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Asher gave you this advice?\u201d I do not doubt this, but seriously, what the f**k does that even mean?</p><p>\u201cHe did. And it worked, so there you go.\u201d He pats my back shaking his head, leaving me standing in the middle of the barn wondering how the f**k he and Asher ended up married.</p><p>My GPS tells me I have reached my destination, and I look around the apartment complex. I come to realize that they live in an area known as \u2018High Row\u2019; the whole areas is infamous for its easy access to drugs...and my daughter and woman are living here. I shake my head when Trevor\u2019s advice comes to mind. After parking, I get out of my truck and slam the door. The doll I got for Ashlyn is in my hand as I walk up the two flights of stairs and knock on their door. I can hear laughter coming from the other side. When the door opens, Lilly takes a step back.</p><p>\u201cSorry, we just got up so were making pancakes,\u201d she says as I close the door behind me. She\u2019s wearing a black tank top that is completely form fitting, and her legs are covered in tight, black spandex. I growl when she turns away from me; her perfect ass is on full display. She might as well be wearing nothing with how much her pants show off. She looks over her shoulder and my eyes fly up; I can\u2019t help but smile at the look on her face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no problem.\u201d I shrug, and her eyes narrow slightly. We walk around the corner into the living room/kitchen; the space is small, and most of the items in it have seen better days. Ashlyn is sitting on a barstool stirring a bowl of pancake batter. She is still in her pajamas, her hair is all over the place, and when she sees me she smiles, showing off one little dimple in her right cheek. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou came!\u201d she says happily, looking at me, then her mom.</p><p>\u201cI told you I would.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cI know, but...\u201d She pauses, looking back at her mom.</p><p>\u201cI told you he would be here,\u201d Lilly reassures her, and Ashlyn shrugs, going back to mixing.</p> <p>\u201cIs it time to add eggs?\u201d Lilly asks her.</p><p>\u201cYes, can I crack them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about if Cash helps you crack them while I start the bacon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She smiles, and all I can think is how much I love her already. \u201cIs that for me?\u201d she asks, pointing to the doll that\u2019s still in my hand.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d I tell her, sitting the doll on the counter. \u201cHow about if she watches while we make breakfast?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she says, looking at the doll as I place it on the counter in front of her.</p><p>\u201cHere you go.\u201d Lilly hands me three eggs and a bowl. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to eat egg shells, so this is easier,\u201d she says quietly before walking back to the fridge, bending over. I have to bite the inside of my cheek to keep from groaning. I haven\u2019t been with anyone since my divorce; I learned a hard lesson when that shit went down. It wouldn\u2019t matter though; even if I had been f**king everything that walked, Lilly had always done it for me. She is the perfect package of sweet and sexy. Watching her with our daughter is completely different than watching Jules with Jax. When we lived together, I may as well have been a single father. The only time Jules had anything to do with Jax was when it was time to show him off like a new handbag, but the minute he served his purpose, she would hand him back to me. I shake my head and turn, just as I see Lilly\u2019s head come up.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to do this?\u201d I set down the bowl, hand Ashlyn one egg, watch as she taps it lightly to the countertop, and when she gets it to crack, she lifts it over the bowl. Both of her small hands wrap around the egg and her hands squeeze, crushing it. I laugh, looking at the bowl that is now full of shells and egg.</p><p>\u201cI did it!\u201d She smiles, and it\u2019s just like her mom\u2019s, bright and blinding.</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d I nod, handing her another egg. She follows the same steps two more times; I take the bowl away from her, along with one of the egg shells so that I can fish all the broken pieces out of the bowl. I feel the weight hit my chest and look up to see Lilly watching us. She\u2019s smiling, but she also looks sad. I reach over, running my finger down her arm; she shakes her head, looks away and puts more bacon into the pan.</p><p>\u201cNow we hab to mix it.\u201d I finish removing the shells and hand her the eggs so she can dump them into the mixing bowl.</p> <p>\u201cHere.\u201d Lilly hands me a measuring cup full of milk, and I dump it in while Ashlyn stirs.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the pans?\u201d I ask Lilly, my hand at her waist. I feel her shiver as my fingers flex against her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She looks over her shoulder at me and I spread my fingers out, putting slight pressure on her waist. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cAsking where the pans are.\u201d I smile when she gives a slight growl, stepping out of my grasp.</p><p>\u201cDoes your wife know you\u2019re here?\u201d She covers her mouth, looking over at Ashlyn who is not paying any attention to what we\u2019re doing; she is still happily stirring the batter.</p><p>\u201cMy wife?\u201d My fists clench. She clears her throat.</p><p>\u201cNever mind. The pans are next to the sink.\u201d I grab her hand, forcing her to follow me. We\u2019re going to get this shit settled right now. \u201cNow what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to get a few things straight.\u201d I turn her so her back is against the wall, and she presses against my chest, trying to shove me away. Her size compared to mine makes it impossible.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d she asks, and I press into her. We\u2019re just around the corner from where Ashlyn is sitting. If I lean back, I can see her.</p><p>I put my mouth near her ear so I don\u2019t have to talk too loudly. \u201cI am not f**king married.\u201d I press my hips into hers. \u201cI was married. It didn\u2019t last long. I hated my wife. I hated the reasons why I had to marry her. I missed you every day, but I do not regret marrying her because I have my son now.\u201d Her eyes search mine; she crosses her arms over her chest. I pull her arms apart, putting them up above her head.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she cries, wiggling and trying to get free. Her breathing speeds up, her eyes drop to my mouth, and just like that, it\u2019s on. My body presses the length of hers, and keeping her hands above her head, I attack her mouth. I lick her bottom lip and her mouth opens under mine. My tongue touches hers and I coax hers into my mouth then suck hard, making her moan. She pulls back, biting my lip. I drop her hands and fist her hair, forcing her head one way and tilt mine the other. I missed this; I forgot how much I loved kissing her, and she could f**king kiss like no other. I pull back, laying my forehead on hers, trying to catch my breath and calm the hard-on that is making my jeans way too tight.</p><p>\u201cI'm going to make you fall in love with me again,\u201d I tell her without thinking.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asks as I press my mouth to hers one more time, not answering her question. I step away, walking back into the kitchen to finish making breakfast.</p><p>I look over at Lilly, who is standing on the other side of the counter. \u201cThis weekend we will be going to my mom and dad\u2019s for a bar-b-que.\u201d I run my hand down Ashlyn\u2019s hair then look at Lilly. \u201cI will come pick you up with Jax, and we can head over there together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d she mumbles, looking confused. Her lips are swollen and her cheeks are a light pink. Trevor\u2019s words come back to me again. I don\u2019t know if he is right, but I guess we will find out.</p><p>\u201cYou should pack a bag and we should have a sleepover this weekend,\u201d I say, making Lilly\u2019s eyes grow wide.</p><p>\u201cYay, sleep over!\u201d Ashlyn claps, making me smile and bend over to kiss the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Lilly states, crossing her arms over her chest, showing off the curves of her br**sts.</p><p>\u201cWell, if we\u2019re going to go to the zoo Saturday morning, it will be easier if we all sleep in the same place. I mean, Jax and I could stay here, but you don\u2019t have as many rooms as I do.\u201d I shrug like it\u2019s no big deal either way.</p><p>\u201cWere going to the zoo?\u201d Ashlyn whispers, looking at her mom. Lilly\u2019s eyes fly to hers, and her face completely changes. \u201cCan we, really?\u201d Ashlyn asks.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure, we can go.\u201d Lilly takes a step over towards Ashlyn, looking into the bowl. \u201cIs that all ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Ashlyn smiles, and Lilly kisses her forehead before taking the bowl away from her and setting it close to the stove. She goes about pulling out a pan and heating it up, while I talk to Ashlyn about the zoo and what she would like to see. Every chance I get, I touch Lilly, making sure she knows I haven\u2019t forgotten about her. She doesn\u2019t say anything, and I can see the wheels in her head turning. When breakfast is done, we sit down around the small table to eat.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Jax?\u201d Ashlyn asks, taking a bite of her pancakes.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with my mom\u2014your grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I see him tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t see him until the weekend.\u201d I look between Ashlyn and Lilly, coming to a decision. \u201cUnless we come over tomorrow and take you ladies out for pizza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay, pizza!\u201d Ashlyn yells, and I laugh. I look up at Lilly, who doesn\u2019t look very happy.</p><p>\u201cGo get dressed, love bug,\u201d Lilly says. Ashlyn scoots off the chair, and then heads down the hall to her room. Once she is out of sight, Lilly turns on me. \u201cLook, I am happy you want to be a part of Ashlyn\u2019s life, but that doesn\u2019t include me, okay? I mean, we haven\u2019t been a we for a long time.\u201d She stands, picking up her plate.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to change.\u201d She turns to face me; the pain in her eyes is so raw that my gut clenches.</p><p>\u201cI trusted you. I loved you. You destroyed me. If I hadn\u2019t had Ashlyn, who knows what would have happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I destroyed myself when I left you. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. Jax\u2019s mom was threatening to have an abortion. I always wanted you. I missed you every day, but I did what I had to do to protect my son. Wouldn\u2019t you do whatever is necessary to protect Ashlyn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I could see tears spring to her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou have been the only woman besides my family who I have ever loved. I never wanted to hurt you, Lilly, and I will find a way to prove to you that things are different this time. But we will work this out. You are my one. I gave you up once, but that will never happen again.\u201d I pull her into me, holding her close. She is stiff for a second before her body relaxes.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I hate you?\u201d Her words are quiet, and I can hardly make them out.</p><p>I whisper into her ear before kissing her under it, \u201cBecause I am your one, too.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Lilly</p><p>\u201cMommy, why do you keep talking to yourself?\u201d I look down at Ashlyn, who is sitting on the floor playing with the doll that Cash brought her the first time he came to visit. Since then, he has been here three times with Jax so we could all have dinner together. I have been so afraid to trust what\u2019s going on between us, but it feels so right. He hasn\u2019t kissed me since he had me pinned against the wall, but he never lets me get too far away from him, and if we\u2019re out in public, he is always touching me. I feel safe and cared for. I feel exactly how I felt the last time we were together, and I think that\u2019s what scares me the most.</p><p>\u201cI'm not talking to myself,\u201d I say, even though I know I have been. I am so nervous I feel like I'm going to jump out of my skin. I have spent the day baking cookies, a cake, and two pies, trying to rid myself of the nervous energy that is coursing through me. I hear the knock at the door, so I run and unlock it before even checking to make sure who it is.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t check the peephole,\u201d Cash says quietly.</p><p>\u201cHi, honey,\u201d I say, running my hand down Jax\u2019s hair as he hugs my legs before heading inside.</p><p>\u201cI knew it was you,\u201d I say, taking a step back.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know it was me. You didn\u2019t call out my name, or check the peephole. Don\u2019t do that shit when you and Ashlyn are here alone. This is a bad area, and if something happens to you, I'm going to be pissed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou always say that. \u2018I\u2019m going to be pissed.\u2019 When was the last time you were pissed?\u201d I ask. His head tilts, studying me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. A while, why? You trying to piss me off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No!\u201d I squeal as he leans in, pressing me to the wall behind me.</p><p>\u201cYou have a perfect ass, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I breathe, feeling goose bumps form across my skin.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to get my hands on it and turn it red, so please, try to piss me off. It will just get me what I want faster.\u201d I feel moisture flood between my thighs at his comment. I have never been spanked, and I don\u2019t understand why that turns me on, but it does.</p><p>\u201cYou did not just say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou smell good.\u201d He runs him nose from my ear to my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, what are you doing?\u201d Jax asks. I jump and look at Ashlyn and Jax, who are both staring at us. Cash slides his arm around my waist, pulling me closer to him.</p><p>\u201cAre you guys ready to go?\u201d Jax looks between us before shrugging, and Ashlyn smiles.</p><p>\u201cI have to grab my bag.\u201d I step away.</p><p>\u201cI forgot to tell you that we are now having the Bar-b-que at Asher\u2019s because they have a pool, so you should pack a suit.</p><p>\u201cYay! Swimming!\u201d Ashlyn jumps up and down.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have swim suits,\u201d I say, looking at Cash.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so we can stop on the way and pick something up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? I don\u2019t want to be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. Grab your bag and we can head out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not wearing that.\u201d I roll my eyes at Cash, who keeps trying to hand me bikinis.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? What\u2019s wrong with this one?\u201d He holds it out, looking at the front then the back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s missing a huge chunk...like, the whole middle section,\u201d I tell him, picking up another one-piece and checking the size. Cash is pushing the cart, with both of the kids sitting in the large basket.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d I put the suit over my arm. I already found Ashlyn one, so we could go to check out.</p><p>\u201cYou have a beautiful body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a child and not everything went back to the way it was before. And please, don\u2019t start. I'm not one of those girls who\u2019s all like, \u2018I'm fat blah, blah, blah\u2019. It\u2019s not that. It\u2019s just, I jiggle now, and I don\u2019t really want to jiggle in front of anyone but myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuy both and let me be the judge.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUm, no,\u201d I say, walking in front of the cart and heading to check out. Once there, I notice that I'm at the end and Cash is near the cashier. \u201cHey, I can pay.\u201d I walk up to the checker and look at Cash. \u201cThose are mine; I'm paying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you have done enough. I'm paying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash.\u201d I try to give him a warning.</p><p>\u201cLilly.\u201d He puts his hand to the back of my neck, pulling me close.</p> <p>\u201cI have missed out on this. Don\u2019t argue with me about it, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I roll my eyes just to say I don\u2019t agree. He kisses me on the forehead, drops his hand, and turns back to the cashier. Once he pays, we head out to his truck. We both get the kids buckled in before getting into the front of the cab. I can\u2019t keep still; my leg keeps bouncing up and down. I am so nervous about meeting his family. I know they probably hate me for keeping Ashlyn from them. I wonder what he has told them. We have spoken a few times over the past week about his marriage and how much his family hates his ex. I don\u2019t want them to hate me. My biggest fear is them thinking that I kept Ashlyn away from Cash out of spite, and not out of my need to protect her. I hate that he was married, and knowing that if I would have swallowed my own pride, he would have been there for Ashlyn. But I have to believe that everything happens the way it should. When I called my mom yesterday, she wasn\u2019t happy about the way things were going between Cash and me. She thought I was letting him off the hook. I know she\u2019s right; I also know that I can\u2019t be that woman who would hold it over his head. Even if we weren\u2019t together, I couldn\u2019t do that. It isn\u2019t in me to act like that. I know if I held onto the pain of our past, it would eat away at me.</p><p>\u201cBabe, calm down,\u201d Cash says, bringing me back to the moment.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m just nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy family will love you.\u201d He grabs my hand, the warmth from his touch settling my nerves.</p> <p>\u201cI doubt that,\u201d I say quietly, looking into the backseat, noticing the kids are quiet. They both have headphones on and are watching a show on the small screen hanging from the roof of the truck.</p><p>\u201cI know they will.\u201d He squeezes my hand.</p><p>\u201cDo they hate me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, they don\u2019t hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2014\u201d I start but he interrupts me.</p><p>\u201cYou did what you thought you had to do.\u201d I look at him when he takes his hand away from mine to hold onto the steering wheel. I watch, as his knuckles turn white with his grip. \u201cI f**king hate this.\u201d His words are so harsh that I can feel pain in them. \u201cI hate that if I had chosen you, I wouldn\u2019t have Jax. I hate what I did, and that I lost you and Ashlyn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say quietly, running my hand down his arm. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t do that. We both could have done a lot of things differently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I think I would feel better if you would flip out.\u201d</p><p>I start laughing. I can\u2019t help it; he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s asking for. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d I say, looking out the front window of the truck.</p><p>\u201cI used to love it when you would get pissed.\u201d I look at him, seeing him smile. \u201cSometimes I would egg you on just so I would have a reason to settle you down.\u201d I clench my thighs together at the memory his words provoke.</p><p>\u201cYou used to make me so mad.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cI think you liked getting mad at me as much as I liked making you mad.\u201d I laugh at the stupidity of it, even though he is so right. I used to love when he ended a fight between us. \u201cWe were good together.\u201d I bite my lip against the pain those words cause. I feel him reach over and grab my knee.</p><p>\u201cGive us a chance to get back there.\u201d I want to, more than anything I have ever wanted, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible. We\u2019re not the same people we were back then. We both have responsibilities that go way beyond just the two of us. I look over at him when I feel his fingers flex around my thigh. \u201cI know that we have a lot to work on, and I know that it\u2019s going to take time for us to rebuild what was broken, but I also know that if we do, we will have something that is beyond anything that either of us thought possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just,\u201d I pause, clearing my throat, \u201cI just need time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTime I can give you, as long as I know that when the time\u2019s up, we\u2019re in the same place.\u201d Tears start to fill my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can get lost in you again,\u201d I whisper, looking down at his hand.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be lost together; you won\u2019t be alone.\u201d I look at him; he takes his eyes off the road for a second and all I see is honesty.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, and look back out the window. As we turn, there is an old barn and a long dirt road that looks like it leads to nowhere. Then we come over a small hill and the most amazing house appears in front of us. It\u2019s a large log home with a wraparound porch that\u2019s lifted off the ground with cars parked underneath it.</p><p>\u201cWow, this is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Asher built it. We all helped, but most of the interior he did alone.\u201d We park on the side of the driveway. There are two cars, a couple of Jeeps, and a large truck parked there as well. I look around, seeing that everyone is here before us, and just like that, my nerves are back and I feel like I might vomit. I hop out of the truck. Opening the back door, Jax is already out of his seat and is helping Ashlyn with her buckles.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Cash says, opening his arms so he can carry both of them. I reached in, starting to grab bags and everything else. \u201cBaby, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll come back out.\u201d When he gives me \u2018the look\u2019, I reluctantly set a couple of the bags back down and grab the pie. Before we even make it to the stairs, the front door swings open and a beautiful older woman with chin-length brown hair steps out onto the porch. She is slim and tall, and has on a pair of khaki shorts and a white button up shirt, with simple sandals on her feet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here!\u201d she cries, running out to greet us. She doesn\u2019t stop at Cash, who is in front of me; she runs right to me, her hands going to my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m Susan. Oh my, you\u2019re so pretty, and I love your hair.\u201d She pulls me forward, making me stumble into her. My arms try to go around her, but the bags in my hand, along with the pie I'm trying not to drop to the ground, are making it difficult.</p><p>\u201cMa, you wanna not freak my girl out?\u201d I hear Cash say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI'm not freaking her out.\u201d She pulls me away from her to look into my eyes. \u201cI'm not freaking you out, am I?\u201d I laugh slightly; she doesn\u2019t look like she would care if I told her that she is freaking me out. \u201cOh, my goodness gracious.\u201d She lets go of me and covers her mouth, looking at Ashlyn. \u201cLook at this beautiful angel.\u201d Ashlyn looks over at me, then back at Susan.</p><p>\u201cMom, this is Ashlyn.\u201d Cash says, turning his body so that Ashlyn is closer to his mom.</p><p>\u201cHi! I'm your grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Ashlyn says in her shy voice, laying her head on Cash\u2019s shoulder. Tears start forming in my eyes at the sight.</p> <p>\u201cYou ready to go meet your cousins?\u201d Susan asks as Cash sets the kids on the ground. Ashlyn shrugs, looking at me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, love bug.\u201d Jax grabs Ashlyn\u2019s hand, starts walking her up the stairs and into the house, with Susan following close behind them. I stand there and watch as Cash goes back to the truck and starts getting the rest of the stuff that I didn\u2019t grab.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d he asks, coming to stand next to me. I take a deep breath and let it out. I\u2019m not ready.</p><p>\u201cSure, let\u2019s go,\u201d I lie. The minute we walk into the house, I\u2019m blown away. It is beautiful, with a huge open floor plan, a sunken living room, and a large kitchen with all up-to-date appliances. We step down into the living room just as the back sliding door opens. A guy who looks a lot like Cash steps inside shirtless, his arms covered in tattoos, all bright and colorful against his tan skin. His hair is long on the top and short on the sides, giving the appearance of a not-so-gothic Mohawk.</p><p>\u201cNico, this is Lilly. Lilly, this is my brother Nico.\u201d I look over at Cash who, yes, has the same facial features, but where Cash looks like all-American baseball player, Nico looks like the only reason he would have a baseball bat is to beat you with it.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, trying to wave, and just like that, the pie I was carrying went falling to the floor, the chocolate pudding landing upright, but the force of the impact making most of the contents splash out all over my legs. \u201cNo,\u201d I whisper, looking down at the mess I made.</p><p>\u201cWell, I can see not much has changed.\u201d I look up, seeing Cash\u2019s brother Trevor, the one I met at the coffee shop all those years ago. He still looks the same, if not a little bit more handsome. Then another guy walks in, looking like he could be Cash\u2019s twin, but upon closer inspection I can tell he\u2019s just a little older, and his hair is a few shades lighter than Cash\u2019s and cut low. I can feel my face heating up when they all surround me. I look back down at my feet, praying to disappear.</p><p>\u201cLet me help clean this up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think it\u2019s best if you stay where you are,\u201d Nico says with a smirk that I have the urge to wipe off his face.</p><p>\u201cThis is my other brother Asher. I don\u2019t know if you remember Trevor. Cash talks softly; my eyes go to him, and he looks like he wants to laugh. I feel a wet cloth on my leg, and I look down to see Nico wiping me off, making me jump back. I start to fall when my foot catches on something\u2014okay, my foot caught on my other one, but whatever\u2014then arms and a lot of bags wrap around me. \u201cI got you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I look around to see all the guys with full smiles on their faces. \u201cThis is really embarrassing.\u201d I don\u2019t even realize I say the words out loud until they all start laughing.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing to her?\u201d I hear a woman ask. I look up to see a beautiful woman with long brown hair coming in to stand next to Asher; his arm goes around her and he kisses the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby. This is Lilly. Lilly, this is November, my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, I'm so sorry about this mess,\u201d I say, pointing down at the pie that is being scooped up off the floor by Nico.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally meet you, Lilly.\u201d She smiles, making me feel better about being here. \u201cLet me show you the bathroom and you can wash your legs off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you too. And that would be good.\u201d I look down at my legs; one has smeared chocolate all over it from where Nico tried to wipe me off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her; I just need to set this stuff down,\u201d Cash says, and Asher takes the bags from him.</p><p>\u201cLet me take those,\u201d Trevor says, grabbing the ones out of my hand as well.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I look up to see everyone watching me closely, then another beautiful woman comes in with long blonde hair, and she has a very obvious baby bump. I feel like I stepped into the world of beautiful people.</p> <p>\u201cLiz, this is Lilly. Lilly, this is Liz, Trevor\u2019s wife.\u201d Now my hands are free, I reach forward and shake her hand.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too. I was just coming in to see where everyone disappeared to,\u201d Liz says, and Trevor comes back over, wrapping his arms around her waist, setting his chin on the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cWell, baby, you see, Lilly here is a bit of a klutz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I'm not.\u201d My eyes narrow on Trevor and I hear him laugh.</p><p>\u201cI think Trevor is right. Who waves while holding a pie?\u201d Nico points out my stupidity.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s polite to wave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re passing someone on the street,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think about it,\u201d I mumble, looking at the ground and feeling like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cThese guys are all big bullies,\u201d Liz says, tilting her head back to look at her husband.</p><p>\u201cI think when they pick on you it means they like you,\u201d November points out.</p><p>\u201cCan you watch the kids for a second? I\u2019m gonna take Lil to the bathroom and help her get washed up,\u201d Cash asks the room of siblings.</p><p>\u201cIs that what we\u2019re calling it today?\u201d Asher asks, and my already red face burns hotter. I feel someone watching me, and my eyes go to the kitchen to see Nico dumping out the pie, his eyes on me. I don\u2019t know why, but I feel like he is judging every move I make.</p><p>\u201cMommy, they hab a puppy!\u201d I hear Ashlyn yell as she runs into the house right to me. Her hair is a mess, with grass and twigs sticking out of it, and dirt is covering her clothes. There is another little girl following close behind, but she has blonde hair. When Ashlyn reaches me, her arms go out for me to pick her up. \u201cMommy, they hab a puppy and he\u2019s so cute!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and his name is Beast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeast?\u201d I wonder why they would name their \u2018cute puppy\u2019 that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan we get one?\u201d she asks, giving me her best pleading face.</p><p>\u201cI, um...we can\u2019t get one now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her bottom lip pops out, and I know what\u2019s coming.</p><p>\u201cNo pouting, what did we talk about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut he\u2019s so cute,\u201d she says, that pouty lip trembling.</p><p>\u201cI know, baby.\u201d I laugh, pulling her head to my chest and kissing the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you can come visit Beast whenever you want.\u201d Ashlyn lifts her head to look at November. \u201cPlus, I'm sure July, June, and May would like you to come over and visit.\u201d I looked at Cash, wondering if this was some kind of strange test. Who would have the name November, and then name their children after the other months of the year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, those are their girls\u2019 names,\u201d Trevor says reading my face. \u201cI think they\u2019re trying to make a calendar.\u201d He shrugs, making Asher hit him upside his head while November and Liz roll their eyes at the same time. Ashlyn wiggles, wanting down.</p><p>\u201cI will be out in a few minutes. You be good until then, all right?\u201d I tell her, not yet releasing her to run off.</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d she says, completely annoyed with me. So just to annoy her more, I kiss her all over her face, making her scream with laughter.</p><p>\u201cSee you in a few minutes.\u201d I kiss her one last time then release her. When I stand back up, everyone is staring at me, but Cash\u2019s eyes are so warm that my pulse starts to race.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d I look around.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you washed up,\u201d Cash says, grabbing a bag from the couch. I would have gone anywhere with him at that point, just to get away from the strange vibe I was getting from everyone.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d I ask as soon as the bathroom door closes.</p><p>\u201cMore than.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, it just that I felt like everyone was waiting for something to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ex wasn\u2019t the easiest person,\u201d he mumbles, closing and locking the door behind us.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I slip off my sandals.</p><p>\u201cShe would start fights over everything under the sun. She always made it seem like everyone was out to get her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere they?\u201d I mean, I don\u2019t know this woman, but I do know women, and we have a tendency to band together.</p><p>\u201cNah, my family\u2019s not like that; even if they didn\u2019t like her, she would never know it.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That didn\u2019t make me feel good.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this off.\u201d He starts pulling my dress up.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to take my dress off to wash my legs.\u201d I slap at his hands away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re also going to try this on while we\u2019re in here.\u201d He pulls out a black bikini from the bag he brought into the bathroom with him. The same bikini he was trying to get me to buy when we were in the store.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d I shake my head, pulling down the showerhead and stepping into the tub. Wrapping the bottom of my dress higher around my waist, I start to rinse off my legs.</p><p>\u201cWill you please try it on for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I don\u2019t even look at him when I answer.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d I finish washing the pudding off my legs, turn off the shower, dry off, and reach out, grabbing the suit from him and pulling the shower curtain closed. I forgot this about him. I forgot that when he wanted something, he would not stop until I did whatever he wanted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re annoying,\u201d I grumble, pulling my dress up over my head and hanging it over the shower rod along with my bra, but I leave on my thong. Once I have the suit on, I adjust everything, making sure nothing is popping out.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d I slide the curtain open, placing my hands on my hips.</p><p>\u201cFuck me.\u201d He brings his fist up to his mouth, biting down on it. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right; you\u2019re not wearing that shit out there if Kenton or Sven come today.\u201d He starts shaking his head in the negative.</p><p>\u201cI told you so.\u201d My stomach drops. I\u2019m not gross to look at, but I don\u2019t look like I did before when we were together. My waist and hips expanded, along with my br**sts. And I have stretch marks from when I was pregnant. I pull the shower closed, take off the top and the bottom, and reach for my dress. Just as it slides over the rod and into my hands, the shower curtain opens. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask, covering my br**sts in a slight panic. His eyes are dark and hungry, making me take a step back.</p><p>\u201cYou were beautiful when we first met.\u201d Great, I don\u2019t need him to tell me how different I am now. I know.</p><p>\u201cBut now, that beauty has become something straight out of a f**king pin-up calendar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at you.\u201d His eyes roam my body from my hair to my toes. \u201cI need to touch you so that I know you\u2019re real\u2014that you\u2019re really here.\u201d He steps into the shower and pulls the curtain closed. I can\u2019t talk; I feel like I\u2019m being cornered by a large predator. He takes another step towards me, making me retreat a step back, causing my back to hit the cold tile behind me. One of his hands goes to the wall above my head, the other to my waist, pulling my lower body against him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I breathe.</p><p>\u201cGonna kiss you.\u201d His eyes drop to my mouth and my tongue wets my bottom lip. \u201cJesus,\u201d he groans right before his mouth touches mine; he nips and pulls my bottom lip making me gasp. \u201cOpen your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash,\u201d I whimper, unsure. His fingers on my skin pull me closer and his mouth opens over mine. His tongue touches mine and one of my hands goes to his hair. He growls, his other hand tugging my head to the side as he takes over the kiss and devours my mouth. My other hand goes to his bicep to hold on. I can feel my ni**les scrape against the cotton of his t-shirt as his hand at my waist moves down to my ass. He is rock hard, and I can feel the length of him against my stomach. His mouth leaves mine and travels to my ear, biting down before kissing it, then down my neck. His hand in my hair tugs to the side, giving him more access. He licks over my pulse, then down to my breast. His mouth latches onto my nipple. \u201cOh, my God.\u201d My head falls back against the tile. His mouth travels to my other nipple, giving it the same treatment. \u201cCash,\u201d I moan, my head tilting forward to watch him.</p><p>\u201cCan I taste you, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My body is on fire. He stops what he is doing, his head coming up and his hands holding my face.</p><p>\u201cI want to eat your pu**y. Will you let me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe never did that,\u201d I tell him, something he should know since he was there the night we had sex. We only did it once and it was perfect, until two days later when he called to tell me we couldn\u2019t see each other anymore. \u201cI mean, I have never done that.\u201d His eyes went wide, then darkened.</p><p>\u201cThat makes me very happy.\u201d His mouth comes back down to mine; it feels like he is trying to brand me with his mouth, completely controlling mine. His hand on my face skims slowly down the side of my breast, along my side, and stops at the edge of my panties. I can feel the wetness between my thighs. My clit starts pulsing, needing attention. Teasingly, his fingers travel on the inside edge of my panties, then just below my belly button; my stomach muscles contract. My pulse speeds up, and finally his fingers slide in and over my clit, my body jumping at the contact. \u201cIs all this for me?\u201d he whispers. My answer is a whimper. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to be quiet, baby; my family is out there,\u201d he says softly. My body freezes\u2014how could I have forgotten where we were? Before I can protest, he slides two fingers inside me, his mouth covering mine, and all thoughts leave my head as I moan down his throat. \u201cThat was close. Now, if you want me to eat your pu**y, you\u2019re going to have to make sure that you\u2019re quiet, can you do that?\u201d I shake my head, making him chuckle. \u201cIf you\u2019re not quiet, then you will be spanked when I take you to my house and the kids go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash.\u201d I feel my inner walls clench.</p><p>\u201cYou like that, huh?\u201d His fingers move faster inside me and I can feel an orgasm building. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to come until my mouth is on you.\u201d I want to yell at him to get to it, but he just stands there, his eyes on mine. \u201cJesus, you should see yourself right now.\u201d I think he\u2019s going to kiss me again, but instead, he nips my chin then drops to his knees, lifting my thigh to his shoulder. His fingers tug my thong to the side and his mouth is on me in an instant. I start grinding down against his tongue. I can feel my orgasm building\u2014it\u2019s going to be huge, life-altering. And I know I\u2019m not going to be quiet when I come.</p><p>\u201cYou have to stop.\u201d I push on his head, trying to get away. \u201cCash, I can\u2019t be quiet,\u201d I whimper. He doesn\u2019t stop; if anything, his pace increases, his tongue and fingers moving faster. \u201cI'm going to come,\u201d I cry as I feel myself begin to contract around his fingers. My skin lights from the inside, and a million colors explode behind my eyes. I feel like I\u2019m going to pass out. \u201cCash,\u201d I moan loudly before I catch myself and bite down on my arm. My head is back, eyes closed, and I feel my foot touch the floor as he lets my leg down from his shoulder. My legs feel wobbly, but he holds my hips until he stands so he can pull me to his chest. I don\u2019t know how long we stand like that, but it feels like forever. All I want to do is curl up with him and go to sleep.</p><p>\u201cI love the way you taste, and I love the way you let go the minute my mouth is on you,\u201d he says quietly. I can feel his hard length against my stomach, and my hand starts to move towards the button of his jeans. His hand grabs mine, stopping me. \u201cThere isn\u2019t enough time for that. When I finally get inside you, I'm going to want to take my time and have you in my bed, not here in my brother\u2019s shower. Though I do plan on having you in the shower...just not this one,\u201d he says, and I can hear the smile in his voice. \u201cWe need to go out to the party; everyone is going to be wondering where we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d I groan, rubbing my face. Everyone is going to know what we have been up to while we\u2019ve been in the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s outside.\u201d He tilts my head back with both his hands at my jaw. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d He kisses me softly on my lips then my forehead before opening the shower curtain. \u201cYou should just put the suit back on under your dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not wearing a bikini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLil, your body is perfect, and it looks good on you. Wear the suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I said that I didn\u2019t want Kenton or Sven to see you in it, not that it doesn\u2019t look good, because it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I pick my dress up from where it fell into the tub when he surprised me.</p><p>\u201cBaby, look at me.\u201d My eyes go to his. \u201cYou look perfect; wear that suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur daughter grew inside of you. I loved your body before, and I love it even more now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll wear it.\u201d I can\u2019t help but smile. I put the bikini bottoms back on, then the top before pulling my dress over my head. Once I'm dressed again, we head outside. Cash was right; everyone is out around the pool, and all the kids are playing out in the large grassy area where a large kids\u2019 playhouse is set up. Then I see it\u2014a large dog the size of a horse. One of the little girls is laying over its back while it walks around the playhouse sniffing the grass.</p><p>\u201cIs that Beast?\u201d I stop, looking at Cash.</p><p>\u201cYep, and the little girl on his back is July.\u201d He laughs as we watch her try to stay on the dog\u2019s back; he acts like he doesn\u2019t even notice her. Cash points out each of the girls; three of them are Asher and November\u2019s July, May, and June, and one is Hanna, who is Trevor and Liz\u2019s Daughter.</p><p>\u201cSo Jax is the only boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, yeah, but Liz is pregnant, and they found out a few days ago that they are having a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d I look around the backyard filled with people and all the kids running around. We walk around while Cash introduces me to everyone, then wander over to the grill where an older gentleman\u2014obviously, Cash and his brothers\u2019 dad\u2014is standing with Asher.</p><p>\u201cDad, I want you to meet Lilly. Lilly, this is my dad, James.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNice to meet you, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, now I gotta train another one.\u201d He points the spatula in his hand towards me. \u201cYou call me James or Dad\u2014preferably Dad\u2014none of this \u2018sir\u2019 business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I smile and laugh.</p><p>\u201cI feel old enough with all my grandkids running around calling me papa or grandpa. I don\u2019t need all my pretty daughters-in-laws callin\u2019 me sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm no\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, how sweet!\u201d A woman\u2019s voice cuts me off. \u201cYou want Cash\u2019s new pu**y to call you daddy.\u201d I look up and see a beautiful woman with short shorts, a halter-top, and shoulder-length dark brown hair. She\u2019s tall and wearing wedge heels, making her even more towering. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, Jules?\u201d Cash asks next to me, and I realize that this woman is his ex-wife.</p><p>\u201cI came to see my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re supposed to call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, so you can hide this bitch away? Like I don\u2019t know that you have been sleeping around since before we got divorced.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Cash growls, then I feel a hand on my elbow and I'm being tugged back.</p><p>\u201cMommy.\u201d I hear Jax\u2019s voice and look over to see Ashlyn standing with him off to the side of his mother. \u201cThis is my sister, Ashlyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d I whisper just as Jules\u2019s eyes go to Jax, who is now holding Ashlyn\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a sister,\u201d Jules growls.</p><p>\u201cI do!\u201d He stomps his foot. \u201cDaddy said she\u2019s my sister. He even said we have the same eyes, look,\u201d he says, opening his eyes up wide.</p> <p>I take a step towards them, wanting to grab both of the kids and get them out of this situation. A hand holds me back at my elbow. I look over my shoulder and am surprised to see it\u2019s actually Nico. I glare, and then look back at the kids. \u201cAshlyn, Jax, let\u2019s go inside so Daddy can talk to Jules,\u201d I say as Cash walks over to where the kids are, picking them both up.</p><p>\u201cMy son isn\u2019t going anywhere with you, you f**king bitch,\u201d Jules says to me, and Ashlyn starts to cry. Then Susan and November are there, taking them both from Cash and heading inside. I look towards the yard and see Liz and Trevor taking the other kids into the house.</p><p>\u201cJules, you know that I'm Jax\u2019s granddad, and I would hate to put his mom in jail,\u201d James says; his eyes are cold, and I don\u2019t think he would hesitate to do what he says.</p><p>\u201cOh, like you would really give a f**k,\u201d she says leaning forward, and then looks at me. \u201cWho the f**k are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to leave, Jules. Now,\u201d Cash says, taking a step in front of me. \u201cBro, take Lil inside for me.\u201d He looks past me to Nico.</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d Nico puts his arm around my shoulder and starts to lead us inside.</p> <p>\u201cYou should stay with him,\u201d I say quietly, looking up at Nico. I don\u2019t think he is a fan of mine, but I can tell he loves his brother, and I love\u2014</p><p>Wait...love him? I shake my head. No, I don\u2019t. I care about Cash. Yes, as the father of my child. And want him to be safe, and I can tell that woman is all kinds of crazy. \u201cPlease.\u201d I fist my hand into his shirt.</p><p>His eyes flash something, but it\u2019s gone before I can catch it. \u201cAll right, go on inside,\u201d he says quietly. My stomach is in knots as I pull the door closed behind me. It\u2019s not jealousy; it\u2019s something else. I don\u2019t like the way that woman spoke to her son, and I also didn\u2019t like how she spoke to Cash and his family.</p><p>\u201cShe is never going to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I look over at Liz.</p><p>\u201cWhen she first came forward saying she was pregnant, Cash was devastated about losing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I repeat like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cI mean, he didn\u2019t say anything, but you could see it. You know?\u201d she asks, her eyes coming to mine. I nod in understanding. I was devastated too. \u201cBut then I thought, I mean, I guess we all thought that maybe they could end up happy. Crazier things have happened, right?\u201d She shrugs.</p> <p>\u201cI guess,\u201d I say, feeling like a horrible person for being ecstatic that he wasn\u2019t happily married to her right now.</p><p>\u201cShe was never happy, and did everything in her power to make him unhappy too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She shrugs again. \u201cAll I know is that the day Cash told us that he was getting a divorce, I popped a bottle of champagne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she really that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know the half of it,\u201d she says, looking out the window, watching as Cash, his dad, and Nico all stand watching as Jules flings her arms around. I can tell Cash says something to her when she looks at the glass door, her eyes on me.</p><p>\u201cIf looks could kill,\u201d Liz says.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry; she\u2019s a lot of bark, and no bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, not believing it for a second. I could tell from the look on her face that this is just the beginning. I watch out the glass door as she stomps off through the yard. Cash\u2019s head hangs low. Then Nico is there, putting his arm around his shoulders and telling him something. Then his dad is in front of him, doing the same. I watch for a while, but once Jules doesn\u2019t come back, I go to check on the kids.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby. What are you doing?\u201d My eyes open and Cash is standing above me wearing nothing but a pair of swim trunks. I guard my eyes against the sun, trying to get a better view of his chest and abs. The minute I move, Jax wiggles, and I remember that I have one kid napping on each side of me.</p><p>\u201cWe were reading a story.\u201d I look down at both kids. I put sunblock lotion on them earlier, but it may be time for more. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d I ask as Cash lays down on the other side of Ashlyn.</p><p>\u201cA little after two.\u201d His fingers run along the side of my face, then down and over my bottom lip. \u201cYou\u2019re getting a little pink,\u201d he says, running his finger over the bridge of my nose.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I should probably put some more lotion on, and put more on these two,\u201d I say, running my hands over each of the kids\u2019 heads. Cash\u2019s face goes soft and he leans forward, kissing me softly.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to talk about my ex?\u201d he asks, and it surprises me that he\u2019s the one bringing it up. After she left and I found the kids, he came in to make sure that we were okay. Then he took Jax aside and talked to him. I don\u2019t know what he said, but Jax looked so sad that I hated Jules in that moment. I don\u2019t think any parent should talk to their child the way she spoke to Jax, or the way she talked in front of him. Her and Cash\u2019s problems were their problems and should be discussed between the two of them, not in front of an audience, including six small children.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I shrug; I don\u2019t know if I want to talk about his ex. The thought of him with her makes me feel sick.</p><p>\u201cI would like to get it all out, if that\u2019s okay with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say, taking a deep breath trying to prepare myself.</p><p>\u201cI was hooking up with her before I met you.\u201d He moves, laying on his side and propping his head in his hand. \u201cWe would hook up, but that\u2019s all it ever was.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I swallow the lump in my throat.</p><p>\u201cThe minute I met you, I stopped seeing her and any anyone else.\u201d I nod, my eyes closing in relief. \u201cAbout three months later, she calls me to tell me that she\u2019s pregnant, and that unless I want her to get an abortion, I needed to go with her to the doctor.\u201d I look down to make sure that both the kids are still asleep. I don\u2019t think that this is something they should ever know. \u201cI met her at the appointment and the doctor did an ultrasound. I saw Jax for the first time and heard his heartbeat, and I fell so deeply in love in that moment.\u201d He takes a deep breath. \u201cAfter the appointment, Jules told me that if I wanted her to keep the baby, I needed to cut everyone else off and focus on her.\u201d He looks past me, running his hand over his mouth before his eyes come back to me. \u201cI hated doing it, but I wanted my son. I knew that Jules wasn\u2019t going to make it easy, but at the end of the day, if my child was healthy and happy, everything else would pale in comparison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand that,\u201d I whisper, running my fingers through Cash\u2019s hair that had fallen forward into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell, you know I called you and told you I couldn\u2019t see you anymore.\u201d I nod, that same pain from a few years ago shooting through my chest. \u201cShe moved in with me. I wanted to keep her close; I didn\u2019t want her to have a chance to get an abortion. I was afraid if I turned my back for a second, that\u2019s exactly what she would do. At first, our relationship was nothing but her living in my house, and then things changed. I didn\u2019t love her, but I cared about her, and I looked at Asher and Trevor\u2019s relationships and they were both so happy...and I wanted that for myself. At the time, Jules was so easy to get along with. So I tried to build a relationship with her.\u201d I bite my lip trying not to cry; I don\u2019t want to know this. \u201cIt never worked. Right after we got married, things changed. She changed. She turned into someone who was mean and manipulative. Or maybe she was like that before, but I was wanting what my brothers had so badly that I looked past it,\u201d he says quietly, reaching towards me and wiping away a single tear that has made its way down my cheek. \u201cYou know, she was bad, but I'm also to blame.\u201d He runs his thumb across my bottom lip. \u201cI was still stuck on you, and kept comparing everything about her to you.\u201d Oh, God, I couldn\u2019t take anymore. I was going to start sobbing if he didn\u2019t stop. \u201cI will do everything in my power to keep us together and to make you fall in love with me again.\u201d I don\u2019t think that it\u2019ll be that hard for him to do. My mom and dad are going to kick my ass, but I just can\u2019t help feeling like I\u2019m meant to be with him.</p> <p>\u201cCash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He leans forward, kissing me lightly.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say to you before she left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she was going to try and get custody of Jax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I gasp as I run my hand over Jax\u2019s head at my waist.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry; this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s tried. She won\u2019t take him from me. He doesn\u2019t even really know her. Yes, he knows she\u2019s his mom, but that\u2019s all. They don\u2019t have a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really sad.\u201d I look down at Ashlyn. I can\u2019t imagine not having her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not like normal moms, babe. Even when Jax was a baby, she would get mad if he cried or if he needed attention. My mom has been more of a mom to him than she has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she needs help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know; I tried to help her. I also tried to talk her into seeing someone after Jax was born, but she wouldn\u2019t. The last straw for me was when Jax was learning to walk and he stumbled into her. She was holding a glass of juice, and when he bumped her, the juice went all over her outfit. She pushed Jax back, and then started yelling about her ruined clothes. After that, I kicked her out of the house and told her I was getting a lawyer and filing for full custody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Jax,\u201d I whisper, closing my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s not around often, and if she is, the visitations are supervised.\u201d Just then, I feel movement at my left and look down to see Jax opening his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey, dude, did you have a good nap?\u201d Cash asks him, and Jax climbs over me onto Cash\u2019s chest, kicking Ashlyn accidently in the process, waking her up.</p><p>\u201cHey, love bug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we going to the zoo?\u201d She smiles sleepily up at me, then Cash.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d I tell her as she cuddles into me. Cash pulls me over so my head is on his chest with Ashlyn between us, and Jax laying on top of him. We all lay there, the warmth of the sun beating down on us. Cash\u2019s fingers run up and down my arm. I feel loved, safe, and whole for the first time in years. I know it\u2019s too soon, but it feels so right that I don\u2019t care.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Cash</p><p>\u201cHey, man, are you okay?\u201d Asher asks. I look around the now-quiet jobsite realizing I must have been daydreaming. It\u2019s been two months since the bar-b-que at Asher\u2019s house\u2014two months of getting to know my daughter, and two months of reconnecting with Lilly. All of it has been perfect, except I want more. I want Ashlyn and Lilly in my house with Jax and me. I want to be able to kiss them both before bed at night, and wake up and see them and my son every morning. I hate when I have to say goodbye to them, and I know Jax doesn\u2019t like it much either.</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I smile as Asher sits, opening a bottle of water.</p><p>\u201cHow are things with you and Lilly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally good.\u201d I look at Asher, who seems to want to say something. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I sigh. I know everyone likes Lilly. My mom loves her, but there are times I can see them waiting for her to flip out like Jules would.</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she live with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? That\u2019s what you want to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I mean, I can\u2019t imagine not having my girls there when I get up in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking. But I have been trying to take things slow. I f**ked up big time with her, so right now, I'm just trying to prove to her that I'm in for the long haul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you prove it by this weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I feel my eyebrows draw together in confusion.</p><p>\u201cYou know, this weekend. Can you have her move in with you by this weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you listening to what I just said?\u201d I mean, I want her to live with me; shit, there are a lot of things I want, but taking it slow includes waiting on moving in and sleeping together. Since that time in the shower at Asher\u2019s house, I haven\u2019t had my mouth on anything but her mouth. Just thinking about the way she looked\u2014the way she f**king tasted\u2014makes me hard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome on, I can help you move her in,\u201d Asher says, dragging me out of my dirty thoughts.</p><p>\u201cDude, don\u2019t you think that if it was that easy, I would have had her moved in already?\u201d I shake my head and go to stand.</p><p>\u201cI know, but maybe you need to try harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d I cross my arms over my chest, narrowing my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cNothing, just looking out for you,\u201d he says looking away, and I know he\u2019s up to something.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k is going on?\u201d I repeat.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he mumbles before standing and walking off.

Asher said Lilly would move in this weekend and I said no way, that it would take at least another couple more weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the f**k are we related?\u201d I shake my head. \u201cNever mind. Shouldn\u2019t you be working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I took a break to call Liz to check on her; this pregnancy is a lot harder on her than the last one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I just hate when she isn\u2019t well.\u201d He hands me another sheet of drywall. \u201cI know Jules was never sick, but was Lilly sick with Ashlyn?\u201d he asks, holding the drywall in place.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she said she was nauseous up until six months,\u201d I tell him, feeling my chest squeeze. I hate that she went through that alone. I hate that I missed her body changing.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, you never told me if you confronted Jules about the messages she sent to Lilly.\u201d One night, I asked Lilly to show me the messages that she had printed out. At first, I was going to burn them, but the minute I got them in my hand, I wanted to kill Jules. I read the words over and over again. I hate that Lilly had gotten that kind of response; even though I didn\u2019t send the messages, the fact that they came from my phone, at a time when she needed me, f**ked with my head big time.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to give Jules the power if she knows that she hurt Lilly, even just for a second. She would get off on that shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about that. I don\u2019t know how the f**k you still deal with her ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not by choice. If I could cut her out of my life completely, I would, but I have to think about Jax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. So how is it being a dad to a little girl?\u201d he asks, making me smile.</p><p>\u201cFucking terrifying. I have always been worried about Jax and his safety, but with Ashlyn, it\u2019s something completely different. You know she called me Daddy for the first time a week ago?\u201d I shake my head at the memory. \u201cWe had all gone out to dinner, and then to see the new kid\u2019s movie with the little yellow guys, and we were walking into the theater. I had my hand on Lilly\u2019s ass\u2014where it normally ended up\u2014and Ashlyn and Jax were walking in front of us carrying popcorn when Ashlyn turned to Jax and asked him, \u2018Can I sit next to Daddy?\u2019 I wanted to f**king cry, and Jax, my little man, shrugged like, \u2018I don\u2019t give a f**k who sits where, as long as we\u2019re watching the movie\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, bet that felt good,\u201d Trevor said, slapping me on the back.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it did. It also hurt that it took her so long to say it. Knowing the reasons why she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what is your plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I look at him, my eyebrows coming together in confusion.</p><p>\u201cYou know, moving in, getting married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I'm just taking it one day at a time. I'm just thankful as f**k that Jax has fallen in love with Lilly and Ashlyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d he asks with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in love with Lilly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck yeah.\u201d I nod and can\u2019t help the shit-eating grin that splits my face.</p><p>\u201cI knew it, and I can see when she looks at you and Jax that she feels the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you haven\u2019t told her?\u201d I shake my head no. \u201cWhy the f**k not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you, Dr. Phil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I do know that when I discovered that I loved Liz and held it back, it ate me alive until I cornered her and forced her to tell me she loved me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t that surprise me?\u201d I chuckle.</p><p>\u201cLaugh all you want, ass**le, but I know what I'm talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you let me worry about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, but when you flip the f**k out on her about it, don\u2019t come crying to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d I start to tell him that he needs help when my phone rings, showing that it\u2019s my mom\u2019s number. I answer right away; she has been keeping Jax and Ashlyn for Lilly and me while we\u2019re at work. \u201cHey, Ma, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got a call from Lilly,\u201d she says, sounding concerned. My stomach drops. I can hear the kids in the background laughing.</p><p>\u201cMa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, she says she got picked up by the police,\u201d she whispers into the phone, and I know I must have heard her wrong. \u201cShe\u2019s didn\u2019t want to call you in case you couldn\u2019t pick up.\u201d Oh, God, I was going to be sick.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I ask, starting to wrap up my tools. I feel Trevor at my side, and I know he\u2019s waiting to find out what\u2019s going on.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know; she only had a couple minutes, so she told me where they were holding her and who to contact,\u201d she says, sounding more nervous than before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMa, I need you to talk to me so I can help Lilly.\u201d It takes her a second to pull it together. She tells me where Lilly is and who to contact at the station, and the second I hang up, I'm on the phone with my dad, hoping that he knows someone who can help me out when I get there.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Trevor asks as I head out to my truck.</p><p>\u201cLilly\u2019s being held by the police,\u201d I tell him without thinking.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean she\u2019s being held by the police?\u201d I hold up my hand when Dad picks up. I explain to him what Mom said, and he says he will meet me at the station where Lilly is.</p> <p>\u201cYou gonna tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d Trevor asks. I hadn\u2019t even realized he got into my truck with me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Ma couldn\u2019t tell me much; all she knows is that Lilly is being held, and the officer I need to speak to is Dan Pike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she say what she was picked up for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d I pull my hat off to run a shaky hand through my hair.</p><p>\u201cIt will be okay. Dad will meet us there and get everything straightened out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I mumble, trying to calm down enough so I can drive the speed limit and get to the station in once piece. Trevor and I don\u2019t talk during the drive; my mind is racing with question after question and coming up with nothing. When we finally pull up to the precinct, my dad is already there waiting for us outside the building. I shut off the truck, pulling my hat back on before hopping out.</p><p>\u201cAll right, son, I just talked to an officer and he was able to explain to me that she is being held for questioning. Now, I want you to be calm when I tell you what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen her, but I'm sure she will be fine. Now, she wasn\u2019t arrested, but brought in for suspicion of check fraud, and they say they have evidence against her, but he couldn\u2019t tell me what it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck fraud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019re saying.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, son. They usually don\u2019t bring people in without having a reason to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, you\u2019ve been around her; she can\u2019t even lie without fessing-up right after. I have a hard time believing that she would do what they\u2019re accusing her of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to wait and see,\u201d he says, rubbing the back of his neck, looking away from me. I understand that my family is worried about me, but f**k, they needed to get over it already.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not Jules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon, I never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d I cut him off, \u201cJules has made my life a living hell since the day she told me she was pregnant with Jax. During that time, Lilly was alone. Yes, she had her parents, but she raised our daughter by herself, and even believing what she thought I told her, she still told Ashlyn about me. She\u2019s a good woman and a good mother; she\u2019s also honest and kind. She wouldn\u2019t do this, and if you\u2019re not going to be on my side\u2014which is her side\u2014then I don\u2019t want you here right now,\u201d I say through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou would choose her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck yes, without a second thought. I love you all, but I love her. She has had enough things happen over the last few years, and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on right now inside that building, but I do know the woman I love wouldn\u2019t do what they are accusing her of doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom loves her; so does your grandmother.\u201d His eyes light up.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, \u2018cause she\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, son, let\u2019s go get your girl.\u201d He pats my back before we turn to go into the building. Once inside, we\u2019re ushered into a small waiting area. There is a man there around my age; his pressed, white button-down shirt and khakis make him stand out. When he sees my dad, who is in uniform, he goes right to him.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any information about Lilly Donovan?\u201d the guy asks, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose. My hackles rise at the name of my woman coming out of this guy\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d I ask without thinking. His head swings in my direction, his eyes meeting mine.</p><p>\u201cDavid. Who are you?\u201d he asks, looking me over.</p><p>\u201cHer boyfriend,\u201d I tell him, wishing that I could say fianc\u00e9 or husband.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He shrugs like it\u2019s all the same to him before turning to face my dad again. \u201cSo is she going to be okay? I mean, should I call a lawyer?\u201d he asks, shoving his hands into the front pockets of his pants.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry; my son will take it from here,\u201d my dad says, nodding in my direction. \u201cHe will have her call you when she\u2019s out and settled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, sure, of course,\u201d David says before turning and leaving the room without another look.</p><p>\u201cNot f**king likely,\u201d I say under my breath and happen to look at Trevor, who is wearing a smug grin on his cocky face. If we weren\u2019t surrounded by officers, I would punch him. We all take a seat, and it\u2019s not long before someone comes to get us. We get to a section of the station that is a long hall with a few chairs spaced out. I see Lilly sitting in a metal chair; her face is tilted towards her lap, and even from a few feet away I can see the tears running down her cheeks. \u201cBaby,\u201d I whisper when I get close enough to touch her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it,\u201d she cries softly as I pull her into my arms.</p><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t,\u201d I tell her, pulling her closer to me.</p><p>\u201cThey said that I stole checks from an old woman and wrote them to myself and cashed them,\u201d she cries harder, her body convulsing.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you need to calm down before you make yourself sick,\u201d I whisper into her ear while rubbing her back.</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t ca-calm d-down. They told me that the wo-woman that this happened to d-didn\u2019t even have m-money for f-food be-because of what they th-think I d-did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. We\u2019re going to get this figured out; I promise,\u201d I say, trying to calm her down while the rage inside me starts to burn hotter and hotter. The minute I find out who really did this, I'm going to rip off their f**king head and shove it up their ass.</p><p>\u201cI feel so bad,\u201d she whispers into my chest. My dad stands close by with a look of worry and understanding on his face, and Trevor looks like he is ready to help me hide the body.</p><p>\u201cDid they say you could leave?\u201d I ask her, pulling her small body tighter against mine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, but I can\u2019t leave the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t going to anyways; so that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know; I told them that.\u201d She nods, sniffling.</p><p>\u201cGood, let\u2019s get out of here. We\u2019ll stop by your house and get you and Ashlyn some clothes. Then we can head to my house for the night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I tilt her face towards mine with a finger under her chin. \u201cIf you think for one f**king second that I'm letting you out of my sight tonight, you have lost your damn mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She sighs, looking down.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, darlin?\u201d my dad asks. Her body stiffens and she looks over her shoulder; seeing both my dad and Trevor, her face pales, and I feel her body start to shake.</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d she whispers, looking back at me.</p> <p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay. My dad came when I called him. Both he and Trevor wanted to make sure you were okay,\u201d I tell her quietly.</p><p>\u201cThey already hate me,\u201d she says under her breath as new tears begin to fall from her eyes. \u201cI think I'm going to be sick,\u201d she says before covering her mouth with her hand and running down the hall towards the sign marked restrooms.</p><p>\u201cI think I need to apologize.\u201d My dad lets out a heavy sigh. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that she noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sensitive. The day after the bar-b-que she was excited to get to know you guys. She thought you were all welcoming her into the fold; then she noticed that y\u2019all acted different with her than you do with November or Liz, and that was okay with her. She understood that it would take some time to build a relationship, except no one ever tried, and now she feels like an outsider. Well, except Ma; she has made it clear from day one that she has Lilly\u2019s back.\u201d I smile; I love my mom.</p><p>\u201cI know Liz has called her,\u201d Trevor says, and I nod.</p><p>\u201cShe did, and they talked and Lilly likes her a lot. She likes her and November both.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like Lilly,\u201d Trevor says, shaking his head and frowning.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you all still act like she\u2019s going to wig out if you say or do the wrong thing when she\u2019s around. She can feel it, and so can I.\u201d I rub my face. \u201cShe is here all alone; her parents are in Alaska, and she has no one except Ashlyn, Jax, and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do better,\u201d my dad says, shaking his head. Then he turns as an officer starts coming towards us.</p><p>\u201cAre you all here with Lilly Donovan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I take a step towards him. His eyes go from me to my dad.</p><p>\u201cShit, James, is that you?\u201d the officer asks, looking at my dad with surprise written on his face.</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d My dad steps forward to shake the man\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell have you been?\u201d Dan asks, pulling my dad in for a one-armed hug.</p> <p>\u201cCould be better. My son\u2019s girl was brought in for question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re seeing Lilly?\u201d the guy asks, turning towards me.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that this is hard, and I hate doing this, but it\u2019s not my decision. I'm sorry that she is going through this, and if it makes you feel any better, I don\u2019t believe that she did it. But the evidence is pointing in her direction,\u201d Dan says, looking at my dad.</p><p>\u201cI know that it\u2019s a part of the job,\u201d my dad says, and Dan nods his head.</p><p>\u201cI know she didn\u2019t do it,\u201d I speak up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but until we get evidence that proves otherwise, we are forced to go with what we have. Now, I informed Ms. Donovan that she is not allowed to leave the state, and that it would be best for her if she got a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d I say right away.</p><p>\u201cAlso, it wouldn\u2019t hurt for her to have proof of her whereabouts on the days that the checks were cashed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can get me the dates, I'm sure we can come up with that information. She and my daughter are usually with my son and me,\u201d I say as Lilly starts heading back our way from the bathroom. Her face is pale, and her eyes are red and puffy from crying. I hate that she\u2019s going through this. Once she reaches our group, I wrap an arm around her shoulders, tucking her into my side.</p><p>\u201cLilly, here are the papers that I told you about, and there is also a list of affordable lawyers in there that you can contact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. And I know that the answer will probably be no, but do you think that I can get the address of the lady this happened to? I would like to see if she needs anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry, but I can\u2019t give that information out, but I can give her your information, and she can choose to contact you,\u201d he says with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, thank you,\u201d she says quietly, taking the file folder from his hand.</p><p>\u201cMy card is in there as well, and if you need anything or have any questions, you call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, thank you,\u201d she repeats, and I see the tears beginning to fill her eyes once again.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you out of here, baby,\u201d I say softly, and then Trevor is there, taking her out of my arms and pulling her in for a hug.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, sis. We\u2019ll get this figured out,\u201d he tells her, rocking her back and forth. I hear another loud sob come from her before Trevor transfers her into my arms.</p><p>\u201cYou good riding with dad?\u201d I ask Trevor before scooping Lilly up into my arms. She doesn\u2019t protest, just wraps her arms around my neck, laying her head against my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYeah, man, call me tonight,\u201d he says, looking at Lilly once more before shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming, Dad,\u201d I say as we start making our way out of the building. Once outside, my dad holds open the door of the truck for me as I set Lilly inside, making sure she gets buckled in. When I'm done, I kiss her forehead, and then tilt her chin up to kiss her lips. \u201cGive me a minute to talk to my dad, and then we can go.\u201d She nods, not looking me in the eyes. \u201cLook at me, baby.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cLilly, look at me.\u201d Her eyes come up and meet mine. \u201cThis will all be worked out; I promise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d The word sounds defeated. I press my mouth to hers in another quick kiss before hopping out of the truck and slamming the door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right; she didn\u2019t do this,\u201d my dad says, and Trevor nods in agreement.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I pull off my hat, running my hands over my hair and face.</p><p>\u201cI'm going to call Dan tonight and see if he can tell me anything as a friend. In the meantime, I want you to call our lawyer and get him on the case. Any of the lawyers in that folder are going to be severely over-worked and underpaid, and it will show in their work.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I got your back, and I'm glad you finally got your girl, son.

Can you tell Ma that I\u2019ll come get the kids later, after I get her settled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d he says, patting my shoulder. \u201cTake care of your girl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCall me if you need anything,\u201d Trevor says as I walk around the front of my truck.</p><p>\u201cThanks, T.\u201d I pull open the door to the cab of the truck and climb inside.</p><p>Once we pull up to the apartment, I look around realizing Lilly\u2019s car isn\u2019t in its usual spot. \u201cWhere\u2019s your car, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t start, so I had to get a ride with David from the school,\u201d she says, unbuckling her seatbelt.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me?\u201d I feel my pulse start to speed up. I hate that something happened to her and she didn\u2019t call me. And it pisses me off that I'm pissed she was in a car with another man. I shut off the truck and turn my body towards her, resting my arm on the steering wheel, trying to look casual, even with the blood pumping more rapidly through my veins.</p> <p>\u201cYou were working, and I didn\u2019t want you to worry or hear you say that you were right about my car being a piece-of-crap.\u201d She shrugs, opening the door and hopping out.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She turns towards me, her eyes narrowing slightly.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I may have said that your car was a piece of shit.\u201d I shrug and smile. Throwing my arm around her shoulders, I whisper into her ear, \u201cLooks like you\u2019re getting a new car, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no, I\u2019m getting a lawyer. I am not going to have enough money for a new car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, first of all, you are going to be using my family\u2019s lawyer, and second, I am paying for the car.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the brain power to argue with you right now, but when I do, I will let you know that you\u2019re not buying me a new car. And as for the lawyer thing, if I can afford him, that\u2019s fine. If not, I will have to look somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat part of that didn\u2019t you understand?\u201d I ask, pulling her to a stop and turning her towards me. I place my hands under her jaw, tilting her head back slightly. \u201cI\u2019m paying for the car.\u201d I cover her mouth with mine before she has a chance to say anything. When I pull my mouth away, her lips are still close enough that they brush mine with each word I say. \u201cYou, our daughter, and occasionally Jax ride in that car. You three are the most important people in my life, and I will not have you riding around in a piece-of-shit car when I can easily get you something that is safe. And when the kids go to bed tonight, you\u2019re going to explain to me why the f**k you didn\u2019t call me when your car broke down. And you better come up with something better than you didn\u2019t want to bother me at work, \u2018cause as of right now, my palm is itching, and I plan on spanking you for that shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash,\u201d she says, her eyes heating as she licks her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you want that, baby?\u201d I ask, pulling her closer to me.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t\u2014\u201d she looks away without finishing, and I can\u2019t help but groan when her cheeks turn pink.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to be good. Do you know how many times I\u2019ve had to jerk off because of the state you\u2019ve left me in?\u201d I shake my head. \u201cIt\u2019s too many to count.\u201d I lean forward, running my nose up the length of her neck to her ear, where I bite down gently on her earlobe. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to be inside you. I can\u2019t wait to hear the sounds you make when you come. I can\u2019t wait to feel you squeezing my cock. I remember how wet you were when my mouth was on you and my fingers were deep inside you. I can\u2019t wait to feel that wet heat wrapped tight around me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLilly,\u201d I hear a man call and my head comes up. Lilly\u2019s hands hold my t-shirt tightly in her fists. I look towards Lilly\u2019s apartment, seeing the guy from the police station coming down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWho the f**k is this guy, Lil?\u201d I ask. Her eyes come to mine, and she blinks a few times like she\u2019s trying to clear her head before she looks over her shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s David; we work together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a teacher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he teaches second grade.\u201d She turns in his direction. \u201cHey, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so worried, Lil. I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he says, stepping closer and grabbing her hand. The fact that he used \u2018Lil\u2019 instead of Lilly and now has his hands on her is making me bite down on the inside of my cheek hard. This is what Trevor was saying. Fuck me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, just a misunderstanding. Thank you for stopping by, but I will see you after the weekend,\u201d she says, pulling her hand back to her side.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Cash is here, and we\u2019re going to go get our kids.\u201d My heart jumps at her words, and I want to pound my chest.</p><p>\u201cKids?\u201d I see a slight flash of annoyance and anger cross his face before he hides it, and then his eyebrows draw together in confusion.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve met Ashlyn,\u201d she says and he nods, \u201cand Cash has a son named Jax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He looks at me, then back at Lilly. \u201cIf you need anything, give me a call. Have a good weekend, and I will see you at school on Monday.\u201d He steps forward, pulling Lilly in for a hug. Her body goes ridged and she pulls away quickly, putting a small fake smile on her face.</p><p>I watch as David gets into a newer Nissan, and after he\u2019s in the car, he sits and watches us for a second before starting it up and backing out of the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cHe only works with you?\u201d I ask her, because the look on the guy\u2019s face when she told him that we were together was one of jealousy.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She pulls away and starts up the stairs to her apartment.</p><p>\u201cHas he ever asked you out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce,\u201d she mumbles before shoving the key in the lock and opening the door.</p><p>\u201cJust once?\u201d I ask, because when she\u2019s lying her words are always drawn out to sound more like a question than an answer.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine, a couple of times.\u201d We make our way back to her bedroom. She goes to the closet, pulling out a bag, and starts shoving clothes into it. I stand next to the bed, trying to think of something to say. My mind is turning over; I used to get jealous before when we first started dating, but it was nothing like the feeling I have right now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou said no, right?\u201d My fists clench at the thought of her seeing David\u2014fuck, seeing any man who\u2019s not me.</p><p>\u201cIs that a real question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say through my teeth, wondering why the f**k I\u2019m doing this. I really don\u2019t want to know, and I\u2019m acting like Asher or Trevor with their territorial, over-protective asses.</p><p>\u201cI have never gone out with him. We work together, and he is kind of a friend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow is he \u2018kind of a friend\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, Cash, you\u2019re starting to make me feel like you don\u2019t trust me. I told you we never dated. I told you we work together, and I told you he is a friend. Now unless you want to give me a polygraph, you\u2019re going to have to take my word for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate knowing that you called him instead of me,\u201d I tell her the truth.</p><p>\u201cI never called him.\u201d She shakes her head and looks at me like I\u2019m crazy. \u201cWe left the school at the same time; he was parked next to me, and when my car wouldn\u2019t start, he offered to give me a ride home. I knew your mom had Ashlyn, so I was planning on coming home, changing, and calling you, that way you could take me to my car later and look at it. But when I got home, the police were here waiting for me, so that kind of ruined all of my plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you promise me not to go anywhere alone with that guy?\u201d This is not about me being a jealous ass**le...okay, maybe it is a little bit...but there is something about him that sets my teeth on edge.</p> <p>\u201cCash.\u201d She shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cBaby, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust you.\u201d Her eyes narrow, making her look adorable. My hands go under her jaw, titling her head back. \u201cSomething about him doesn\u2019t sit right with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it because he has a penis?\u201d she taunts. I smile and lean in to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cNo, smart ass, it\u2019s not because he has a penis,\u201d I say against her mouth.</p><p>\u201cCash,\u201d she says softly; my eyes go from her mouth to her eyes. \u201cHe has been nothing but nice. Just, please, trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do trust you,\u201d I tell her honestly. Not only do I trust her, I love her. Maybe Trevor is right in a f**ked-up kind of way, and I need to tell her that I love her...put it out there.</p> <p>\u201cSo just know that I will not put myself in a situation that something could happen to me,\u201d she says, running a hand through my hair. My eyes close when her soft hand travels down my neck and up my jaw.</p><p>\u201cDo you know that I love you?\u201d I ask as my eyes open, looking into hers. I hear her quick inhale and she shakes her head, her eyes searching my face. \u201cI never stopped loving you. I didn\u2019t know how much of the old you was in this newer version,\u201d I smirk, \u201cbut I found out that I love the new you just as much, if not more. I don\u2019t want anything to happen to you.\u201d I pull her against me, resting my cheek on top of her head.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d she says, making me smile and feel lighter than I\u2019ve felt for the last two months\u2014hell, the last few years.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Lilly</p><p>I look down at my lap. Cash\u2019s large hand is entwined with mine, his thumb moving slowly back and forth against my skin. The roughness and strength in his hand makes mine feel small and delicate. I can\u2019t believe he told me he loves me. I knew it would come eventually. He shows me every day that he cares not only for Ashlyn, but for me as well. I have finally accepted that he is not going anywhere. Part of me is still hurt that he walked away from me when I needed him, but the other part understands why he did what he did. I would do anything for my daughter, just like he did for his son. \u201cI think you should meet my parents,\u201d I say, looking over at him. His eyes come to me for a second before going back to the road.</p><p>\u201cSure, we can go during your next school break.\u201d He squeezes my hand before bringing it to his mouth and kissing my knuckles.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t have another break for a few months.\u201d I try to think of a way to have my parents come out here, but right now, getting out of Alaska is like trying to get out of Alcatraz\u2014nearly impossible. The only way in or out of the place I grew up is by boat or plane, and when the weather is bad like it has been, there is no way. \u201cI was going to Skype my mom tonight so she could talk to Ashlyn. You can meet her then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Skype?\u201d I look over in shock. Who in the world doesn\u2019t know what Skype is?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cSkype is only the best invention ever. You use your computer and the other person uses theirs and you call them then they are sitting there in front of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike teleporting?\u201d he asks and I burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cNo, I'm explaining it badly. You see them on the computer like a live video feed. I got my mom hooked when I was home. Her sister lives in Hawaii and they hadn\u2019t seen each other for over four years. Then my aunt was on Facebook one day telling everyone that she got Skype. My mom, who had become addicted to Facebook because of my aunt, wanted to know what Skype was so I took her and got her a camera to hook up to her computer. Now during the winter, when Mom\u2019s stuck inside because there is normally ten-feet of snow outside, she Skypes with my aunt. They also they play all those annoying Facebook games and send everyone they know invites.\u201d I take a deep breath when I'm done talking and he looks over at me and smiles.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what that is. I don\u2019t have Facebook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have Facebook?\u201d I gasp. \u201cHow in the world do you know what\u2019s going on with your friends if you don\u2019t have Facebook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI call them and say \u2018hey, what\u2019s going on? How are things? Anything new?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, I guess you could do that.\u201d He squeezes my hand and chuckles.</p><p>\u201cSo, you want me to meet your mom over Skype? I'm not sure if I'm ready for such a serious step in our relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d I roll my eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll see if she can get my dad to sit down long enough to meet you as well.\u201d I notice him shifting in his seat and squeezing my hand a little tighter. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I mean, I'm sure your dad hates me.\u201d I want to say, \u2018no, of course he doesn\u2019t hate you,\u201d but that would be a big fat lie. I\u2019m Daddy\u2019s little girl, have been and will always be. When I came home with Ashlyn, my parents fell in love with her and couldn\u2019t understand why anyone wouldn\u2019t want her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy parents know that you didn\u2019t send those texts,\u201d I say gently.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He takes a deep breath. \u201cI'm sure they don\u2019t believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom thinks your ex sent them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the only person who could have,\u201d he says, and I can feel my pulse speed up. I have never hated anyone in my life, but what I feel for her is close.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I know once my dad gets to know you, he will love you,\u201d I tell him. He is honestly my dad\u2019s dream-son, and I hope he gives him a chance.</p><p>\u201cI'm sure it will be fine,\u201d he says, and my stomach flips, wondering if this is a huge mistake.</p><p>\u201cHoney, you have to move that out of the way, at least until I can get the camera turned on,\u201d I hear my mom say. I look over at Cash, who is sitting next to me at his dining table. The computer is in front of us, the screen black, but we can both hear my parents arguing back and forth. Cash smiles, and I laugh when I hear my mom yell to get the damn thing out of her face. Finally, the screen turns on, and I see my mom sit down hard in her chair and glare off camera.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, honey.\u201d My mom smiles then looks over at Cash, and her eyes get big before coming back to me. \u201cWell, at least he\u2019s hot, even if he is a prick.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMom,\u201d I snap.</p><p>\u201cOh, please, now I see why you went all gaga over him.\u201d She waves her hand back and forth, and then I see a shadow over her right shoulder before my dad sits down next to her in one of their kitchen chairs. I suck my lips into my mouth, trying not to bust out laughing. My dad is wearing his hunting gear. His short hair is slicked away from his face, and under his eyes are black smudges of paint. He also has his shotgun out and his hunting knife in a knife holster under his arm.</p><p>\u201cHi, Dad.\u201d I give a slight giggle. He glares at me, looks over at Cash, and I look over at Cash as well. His face is slightly red and he looks like he is trying not to laugh. \u201cDad, Mom, this is Cash. Cash, these are my parents, Frank and Tina Donovan,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, sir and ma\u2019am.\u201d He nods at both my parents, and we can hear my mom mumble something under her breath about manners and good looks.</p><p>\u201cDad, why are you wearing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I thought that I should let this young man here know that I was a Seal. I know how to go into places and get out unnoticed. I know how to kill someone before they even know I'm there. And I know how to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I know, but what does that have to do with your hunting gear?</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t fit into his uniform,\u201d my mom chimes in. \u201cTrust me, honey, he tried. Even tried to have me button him up, and it was still a no-go.\u201d My mom shakes her head, and then smiles when my dad turns to look at her and glare.</p><p>\u201cWoman, I told you to stop baking all the damn time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, stop. Don\u2019t blame your weight on my baking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, Dad...\u201d I sigh.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d my dad says, still looking at my mom. \u201cKnow that you\u2019re going to pay for that later,\u201d he says quietly, making my mom blush.</p><p>\u201cGross, can you both please act like normal parents for five minutes?\u201d I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cMemaw!\u201d Ashlyn shrieks climbing onto Cash\u2019s lap and waving into the camera.</p> <p>\u201cHey, baby.\u201d My mom sits forward, smiling.</p><p>\u201cPapa, look! My daddy\u2019s here!\u201d Ashlyn looks at my dad then leans back, looking up at Cash. He leans forward, kissing her forehead.</p><p>\u201cI see that, angel.\u201d Dad\u2019s face transforms into a smile. Ashlyn looks away from Cash, back to the computer.</p><p>\u201cOh wait! You hab to meet my brother!\u201d Ashlyn squeals, climbing down from Cash\u2019s lap. I can hear her in the other room yelling for Jax to come meet her Memaw and Papa. Cash and I look at each other and laugh. Cash slips his arm around my shoulders, pulling me into his side. I feel his lips at my temple, and then Jax and Ashlyn are running into the room. Ashlyn climbs back onto Cash\u2019s lap, and Jax looks at me for a second, seeming unsure. I hold out my arms and he smiles before jumping up to sit on my lap.</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d my dad says, looking between Jax and Ashlyn.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d I scold, covering Jax\u2019s ears. Jax starts laughing, and then Ashlyn joins him. I look at both of them and shake my head. \u201cDo not repeat what you just heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey could be twins,\u201d my mom says, and I look up from the kids\u2019 smiling faces to see tears in my mom\u2019s eyes. \u201cNice to meet you, Jax. You can call me Memaw or Grandma,\u201d my mom says, \u201cand you can call this guy here Papa or Grandpa.\u201d She points to my dad.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Jax says, giving a small wave before leaning back into me. I wrap my arms around him and kiss the top of his head. We have gotten closer over the last couple months, but it\u2019s rare that he will cuddle. Just like Ashlyn, he likes to be off running around creating havoc and chaos.</p><p>\u201cSo how are you, angel?\u201d my dad asks Ashlyn, who is cuddled back into Cash.</p><p>\u201cGood! Daddy says I can get a dog,\u201d she says randomly, and I look over at Cash and glare.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say it was going to happen today.\u201d He looks a little sheepish.</p><p>\u201cI want a dog,\u201d Jax says, leaning back to look up at me.</p><p>\u201cUm...I...well, one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that Spike will like having a dog?\u201d he asks. I know, I know...I kinda ended up liking Spike; he\u2019s cute. But I wonder if dogs eat ferrets.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want Spike to get hurt,\u201d Ashlyn says.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Spike?\u201d my dad asks.</p><p>\u201cMy ferret,\u201d Jax says, looking over at Ashlyn. \u201cWe should go get him.\u201d Ashlyn nods before they both jump off our laps, running to the back of the house where the bedrooms are.</p><p>\u201cSeems you two have your hands full and a good reason for birth control,\u201d my mom says, and I laugh.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but they are both really good kids,\u201d I say, leaning into Cash.</p><p>\u201cSo, what are your intentions with my daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you \u2018Dad\u2019 me; I want to know what his plans are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I would like Lil and Ashlyn to move in with me\u2014\u201d Cash starts to say something else, but my dad cuts him off.</p><p>\u201cSo you want to get the milk for free?\u201d my dad asks with narrowed eyes, and Cash looks confused.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I'm not following.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know, why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free? You want my daughter and granddaughter to live with you, and you don\u2019t want to marry her.</p><p>\u201cNo disrespect, sir, but that is something that I will be discussing with Lilly first before anyone else. And when the time\u2019s right, I will come to you like a man and ask for your permission, not that it will change my mind about asking her,\u201d Cash says, and my dad\u2019s eyes flash, not with anger, but approval, and my tummy flips. Cash said when the time was right, he would ask me to marry him. Oh, my God.</p><p>\u201cWell, I know what Lilly has told us about your situation and what happened in the past,\u201d my dad says looking at me, his eyes going soft. \u201cShe believes you, so I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt, but just remember what I said earlier about being a Seal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a Seal; you\u2019re a Papa Bear.\u201d Ashlyn laughs, climbs into my lap, and Dad smiles. I look over at Jax, who has Spike in his arms as Cash picks him up to sit on his lap.</p> <p>\u201cThis is Spike,\u201d Jax says, holding the ferret out in one hand, his long body swinging back and forth.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he cute, Memaw?\u201d Ashlyn cries, looking at my mom.</p><p>\u201cHe is something.\u201d My mom makes an eeek-face at me, then smiles at Jax.</p><p>\u201cSo, has anything new happened?\u201d my mom asks, and I want to tell her about what happened today with the police, but I don\u2019t want her to worry about it. I know the cop said he believed me, so I just hope he finds who really did this and clears my name.</p><p>\u201cNope, nothing new at all.\u201d Cash squeezes my shoulder. I smile, and my mom\u2019s eyes narrow on me. Dammit, I need to work on becoming a better liar.</p> <p>\u201cSo, Lilly says you do construction,\u201d Dad asks Cash, and they start talking about Cash\u2019s job, then about hunting and fishing, and my eyes start to feel heavy.</p><p>\u201cAll right, love bug, you need to go get ready for bed,\u201d I tell Ashlyn, and she sighs loudly.</p><p>\u201cBye, Memaw. Bye, Papa.\u201d She blows them each a kiss before getting down and walking into the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cYou too, little dude,\u201d Cash tells Jax, who waves bye to my parents.</p><p>\u201cLove you, Mom and Dad,\u201d I say, leaning towards the camera.</p><p>\u201cLove you too, honey. If you need to come home, you just say the word,\u201d my mom says, and I feel Cash\u2019s arm go tight around me.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re good, Mom. I promise,\u201d I tell her, giving her a genuine smile.</p><p>\u201cAll right, it was nice meeting you, son. You take care of my girls,\u201d Dad says, looking at Cash, and then his eyes come to me. \u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too, Daddy,\u201d I say softly, feeling his words deep inside my soul. My parents are the best.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you both,\u201d Cash says before the screen goes black on the computer and my parents are gone.</p><p>\u201cI like your parents,\u201d Cash says, and I look over at him.</p><p>\u201cThey are pretty awesome parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do you say we get the kids to bed and find a movie to watch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I start to stand and Cash stops me, dragging me down onto his lap.</p> <p>\u201cAnd tonight, you\u2019re sleeping with me. No more sleeping in the room with Ashlyn,\u201d he says, his eyes turning a shade darker, and then dropping to my mouth. We have only stayed over a couple of times, but I always sleep on the pull out in the room Cash fixed up for Ashlyn. I bite the inside of my cheek and give a slight nod. \u201cGood. Now, let\u2019s get the hellions to bed so I can get you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I breathe and feel his fingers flex into the skin at my waist.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, and his lips touch mine. His mouth opens, pulling my bottom lip between his teeth. I feel his tongue run over it before his hand slides up my back and into my hair, tilting my head further to the side. I press my tongue into his mouth; his teeth release my lip, and he puts more pressure on the back of my head, kissing me harder. My arms go around his neck, one hand in the back of his hair, running my fingers through it. When our mouths finally part, we\u2019re both breathing heavily. I lean forward, resting my head in the crook of his neck. \u201cThe kids are quiet. We should go make sure they\u2019re not trying to find out how many things they can flush down the toilet before it backs up,\u201d he says after a few minutes. I start laughing. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time, and he is right; when the kids get quiet, they are normally up to no-good.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I sigh; I would much rather stay curled up in his lap for the rest of the night, but parenthood is a never-ending job. Cash stands, taking me with him. Once we\u2019re up, we go down the hall to where two of the four bedrooms are located. Jax\u2019s room is on one side of the hall, and Ashlyn\u2019s is on the other. I stop before Jax\u2019s room when I hear both of the kids\u2019 voices. I can\u2019t make out what they are saying, so I creep forward until I can peek my head around the door. I feel Cash\u2019s hands at my waist and we both stand there in silence, listening to Jax and Ashlyn\u2019s conversation.</p><p>\u201cDaddy said that it\u2019s my job as your big brother to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if Mommy and Daddy have another baby,\u201d I feel Cash\u2019s hands squeeze me, \u201cI will be bigger than them,\u201d she says, and I can see her putting her hands on her hips like a total diva.</p><p>\u201cI will still be bigger.\u201d He sighs like he is annoyed, making me giggle. I step into the room when Jax\u2019s head comes up.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were going to listen to a story,\u201d Ashlyn says, picking up the Kindle Fire from the bed.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? Did you both brush your teeth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d they both say at the same time.</p><p>\u201cDid you put Spike back and make sure that you locked the cage?\u201d Cash asks, and I'm so glad he thought of that. I, for one, didn\u2019t want to wake up with Spike in bed with me.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d they both say at the same time again, looking at Cash and me like we\u2019re annoying them.</p><p>\u201cOne story for both of you. Then it\u2019s bed time,\u201d Cash says.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d they grumble. Ashlyn crawls up onto the bed with Jax, and they pull the Kindle between them and start an audio-story about the Bernstein Bears.</p><p>\u201cWe will be back to tuck you in,\u201d I say, but may as well be talking to air because neither of them are listening to anything I have to say.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you say we skip the movie and go straight to the credits?\u201d Cash says against my ear, his body wrapping around mine from behind as we walk down the hall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho watches credits?\u201d I moan when I feel his fingers slide just under the top of my jeans against my stomach.</p><p>\u201cNo one.\u201d He bites my neck. I then feel his tongue licking the abused skin. My pu**y jumps and wet heat floods my center. My head falls back against his shoulder, my arms going over my head and around his neck. The fingers of one of his hands travels down the front of my jeans, while his other hand comes up to cup my breast under my shirt and over my bra. Goose bumps break out over my skin when I feel the tip of his finger slide between my folds and over my clit.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whisper, arching back as my eyes close.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I want to tear open your jeans and make you come, we can\u2019t do anything until the kids are asleep,\u201d he groans, flexing his hips into my ass. I can\u2019t help but pout when he pulls his hand out of my jeans. When I turn around, his eyes look over my face and he smirks. \u201cMy poor baby. I left you all swollen and wet.\u201d His words send a shiver down my spine, and my pu**y contracts. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t plan on getting much sleep tonight.\u201d He pulls me against him, and I feel the hardness of his c**k against my stomach. \u201cAnd I hope you didn\u2019t have anything important to do tomorrow, because there is no guarantee you\u2019re going to be able to walk.\u201d I feel my pulse speed up, and I take a deep breath. \u201cI love that look, baby.\u201d He leans in kissing me.</p><p>\u201cTake off your clothes.\u201d I jump and spin around at the sound of Cash\u2019s voice. I\u2019m standing in front of his dresser, grabbing a t-shirt to put on after I get out of the shower I am about to take. I had left him a few minutes ago when he was going to \u201cshut down the house\u201d as he put it, and check on the kids one last time before coming to bed. I was nervous. I wanted Cash in the worst way, but I still had no experience except for him that one time, and my LELO, which I used to get myself off.</p><p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d I stutter out. The look in his eyes is so primal that I start to take a step back.</p><p>\u201cLil, I\u2019m not f**king around.\u201d He runs a hand through his hair, making it look messier. \u201cLose the clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d I start to say that I was going to shower, but before I know it, he\u2019s in front of me, his hands ripping my shirt off over my head. I'm caught off guard, but also turned on by how badly he wants me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby, but this is going to be fast. It\u2019s been too long, and I want you too much.\u201d His teeth sink into my neck, and I notice he does that a lot, almost like he\u2019s marking me. His hands are at the button of my jeans, and then I can hear my zipper sliding down. My hands go under his shirt, running along the smooth hot skin of his back. I pull it up, his hands leaving me long enough to put his arms up over his head, pulling his shirt off. My hands automatically wander to his abs, feeling the ridges and valleys under my palms. His body is like a living work of art. \u201cBaby,\u201d he growls, \u201cyou have to stop touching me or this is going to end before I even have a chance to make you come or slide inside of you.\u201d His mouth slams down onto mine as he starts walking me backwards. My hands go to his hair. God, I love his hair. I feel the back of my knees hit the edge of his bed. I feel my jeans tugged down over my hips. Then his mouth leaves mine as he pushes me gently so that I fall onto the bed behind me. He pulls my jeans the rest of the way off. His hands go to my knees, spreading my legs wide. They then slide up my inner thighs where I can feel his thumbs on the outer-edge of my panties. I come up on my elbows so I can see what he\u2019s doing. His eyes meet mine before his face lowers and he runs his nose up the center of the lace that is covering me.</p><p>\u201cCash.\u201d I can hear the uncertainty in my own voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat, baby?\u201d His mouth is hovering over me.</p><p>\u201cI...I...\u201d I try to close my thighs. His hands tighten on my legs. I can feel his fingers imprinting into my skin.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d He turns his head, and I can feel his mouth open over the skin of my inner thigh and suck deeply.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I fall back, covering my face. I can feel my pu**y contract as his hand on my other thigh travels up and under the edge of the lace, his thumb sliding over my clit, then inside.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I\u2019m not going to last,\u201d he says again, taking his mouth away from my thigh. He stands, pulling off his jeans. His hands go to the bed on each side of me. \u201cI\u2019ll make it good for you next time, baby,\u201d he says, pulling me up so I\u2019m in the center of the bed. He rips the delicate lace away from my body, tossing it across the room. Then his mouth is on one of my ni**les, then the other. His fingers slide down my belly, and I feel one enter me and pull up, then out, and suddenly two are filling me. My head starts to thrash back and forth. \u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d he grits out. My eyes fly open when he lifts one of my legs up and over him, turning my body so that he is sitting between my legs. I look down and see his very large erection and his fist wrapped around it.</p><p>\u201cCondom,\u201d I say, and he holds one out and smiles before ripping open the gold package with his teeth. His other hand is slowly stroking up and down his c**k while his eyes are looking between my legs. His eyes come to mine before dropping to his cock, holding the tip of the rubber before sliding it down over his length.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d he growls as he leans forward, filling me in one stroke.</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d I cry, my back arching and my nails digging into his biceps.</p><p>\u201cShit. I\u2019m sorry, baby.\u201d He stills, his hands going to my face as he leans in and kisses me gently.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d I moan, wrapping my legs around him. I\u2019m not in pain; I just feel full and stretched. My nails scrape down his back when he pulls out.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re so f**king tight.\u201d He leans forward, my mouth meeting his as I dig my nails into his scalp when he pulls out and slides back in quickly.</p><p>\u201cYessss,\u201d I hiss. My fingers go between our bodies and slide over my clit, making my hips surge up.</p><p>\u201cFuck yeah, touch yourself.\u201d He sits back on his calves, pulling my knees up as his eyes smolder, watching our connection and what my fingers are doing. I can feel heat pool in my belly, and I know that I\u2019m going to come.</p> <p>\u201cPlease, harder,\u201d I moan and feel him slam against me. I can feel that heat in my belly start to turn into a delicious weight.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he says, his voice strained. My eyes open to look at him. His head goes back, his jaw tight, eyes closed, and I can tell he\u2019s trying to hold off until I come. \u201cI need you to come, baby,\u201d he says, and his eyes open as he leans forward, pulling one nipple into his mouth before biting down on it. And that\u2019s all I needed to send me over. My legs tighten, my hips raise, and that heat and weight turn into a tingle. Then I shatter, seeing a million colors dance behind my closed eyelids. I moan out his name, shoving my face into his neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShit,\u201d I hear Cash say as his hips jerk before leaning forward and biting onto my shoulder. His movements slow and I can feel myself still convulsing around him, trying to pull him deeper. \u201cThat went better than I expected.\u201d The skin of my neck muffles his words.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I run my hands though his hair and wrap my legs a little tighter around him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I would be able to hold out until you came.\u201d He licks my shoulder where he had bitten it. His head leans back so I can see his face. \u201cHey.\u201d He smiles, and both of his dimples make an appearance. His finger runs from my forehead to my chin.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say softly back; he is so handsome, and I can still feel him inside me, and I know that it\u2019s stupid and immature, but I want to stand up and jump on the bed while yelling \u2018I just had amazing, mind-blowing sex with Cash Mayson!\u2019</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that smile?\u201d he asks, leaning in to kiss me.</p><p>\u201cJust happy,\u201d I say, tilting forward to kiss him. His c**k twitches inside of me, and he groans before slowly sliding out. My eyes close slightly, and a soft mewl climbs up my throat at the loss of him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s shower.\u201d He kisses my lips, then my chest and belly, as he climbs off the bed. Once he\u2019s up, he pulls me up so we\u2019re both standing next to the bed. \u201cThen we can come back here and do that again.\u201d His smile is wicked before he kisses me, leading me into the bathroom. I stand behind him, watching his muscles move as he tosses the condom into the trashcan and leans in to turn on the shower. Once he has the temperature right, he looks over his shoulder at me, his eyes traveling down my body. \u201cI have wanted to see you naked, soapy, and wet since we were in Asher\u2019s shower. I guess sometimes wishes do come true.\u201d He smiles, taking my hand, pulling me in and under the showerhead. His hands work warm water through my hair, then shampoo and conditioner. I close my eyes, relaxing into the feeling of him touching me. \u201cAm I putting you to sleep?\u201d He chuckles, and I open my eyes to see him with a big, pink loofa that is covered with bubbles. I raise an eyebrow, looking at it. \u201cIt\u2019s the only color they had.\u201d He shrugs and starts washing me slowly. When he\u2019s finished, he kisses me, and then pulls me behind him and starts washing his own hair. I pick up the same loofa and dump tons of soap on it, washing his back and watching the bubbles slide down his skin and onto the floor of the shower. When he turns around to face me, he\u2019s hard again. He takes the loofa from me.</p><p>\u201cHey, I was doing that.\u201d I pout, feeling like he just stole my candy.</p><p>\u201cI know, baby, but with your hands on me, I can\u2019t control myself, and I didn\u2019t bring a condom in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, looking him over, my hands tingling with need to touch him.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get on birth control,\u201d he says, and my eyes go to his.</p><p>\u201cI'm on birth control. I got on it after Ashlyn was born because my cycle went all wonky,\u201d I say, and I can feel my eyebrows pull together.</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But that doesn\u2019t protect against other things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been with anyone else, Lil, not since long before my divorce. Even when I was married, I used a condom.\u201d</p><p>My stomach rolls, and I hide my face with my wet hair. \u201cOh.\u201d I bite the inside of my cheek. I hate that he was married. I hate that I forget about it all the time, and then something reminds me that this hasn\u2019t always been mine.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s going on in there?\u201d he says, tapping my forehead.</p><p>\u201cI just hate it so much. Can we not talk about you sleeping with her? Like, ever?\u201d I say, feeling like I want to cry.</p><p>\u201cI hate it too.\u201d He nods, pulling me into him. \u201cWe can use protection until you feel ready not to, okay?\u201d He rubs his hands down my back. \u201cI'm clean. I get tested every year with my physical for insurance.\u201d His body stills, then he pulls me away from him. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d His jaw clenches. \u201cI mean, have you been tested lately?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cCash, you\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve ever slept with. Before a few minutes ago, the one time we did it, when I gave you my virginity, was the only time I\u2019ve ever made love. I was too concerned with Ashlyn. I didn\u2019t have time to date...or even really want to.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me with a mixture of shock and awe. \u201cI\u2019m so happy I\u2019m the only one you\u2019ve ever been with. I don\u2019t think I would be able to handle it as gracefully as you do, knowing I\u2019ve been with others,\u201d he says gently. I lay my forehead against his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t mind not using condoms. I mean, I got pregnant with Ashlyn when we used a condom before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, and the same thing happened with\u2014\u201d he starts to say her name but stops, and his arms around me tighten so much that the air rushes out of my lungs.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I say when I'm able to take a breath.</p><p>\u201cNothing, baby, let\u2019s get out,\u201d he says abruptly, turning away from me to turn off the water and get out of the shower, pulling a towel down from the shelve and wrapping it around me before getting one for himself.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. You\u2019re here; my kids are here. I couldn\u2019t be better.\u201d He smiles, but it doesn\u2019t reach his eyes, and I want to ask again but know it will be pointless, so I just sigh and let it drop. Once we\u2019re back in the bedroom, I start to pull out one of his shirts from the dresser. I squeak when he picks me up, carrying me to the bed and tossing me onto the mattress before ripping my towel from my body.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I don\u2019t know why I ask; I can tell by the look in his eyes exactly what he has planned.</p><p>\u201cI'm going to explore you.\u201d He smiles, climbing up the bed.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I breathe when I feel his hands at my feet start to move up my legs.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I missed you. I missed the way you laugh.\u201d He pulls my leg up, kissing the inside of knee. \u201cI missed your smell.\u201d He pulls my other leg up, kissing that knee as well. \u201cI missed your touch.\u201d He runs his hands up the tops of my thighs. \u201cI missed the way we could talk for hours about nothing and everything.\u201d His hands go to my stomach, then up my rib cage. \u201cI missed your kisses.\u201d His knees spread my legs wider. \u201cI missed your mouth.\u201d He leans forward, his mouth landing on mine. \u201cI love you, and I'm so glad I have a second chance,\u201d he whispers against my lips, his forehead touching mine before sliding back inside me. And for the rest of the night, we make love, touch, talk, and share. He explores me and lets me return the favor. When I close my eyes to go to sleep, my body is tucked tight next to his, my head on his shoulder, my leg between his, and his arm wrapped around my waist. I love him, and I\u2019m happy to have a second chance too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 6</p><p>Cash</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d I run across the kitchen into the living room when I see Spike is making a run for it. I grab him just as he starts to get behind the entertainment stand. \u201cJax,\u201d I call down the hall towards his room where he and Ashlyn are playing, waiting for breakfast.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Dad?\u201d he yells back, and I shake my head. I really must have worn my woman out if she\u2019s sleeping though this craziness. I smile and feel my dick jump knowing she\u2019s in my bed with only my t-shirt on, my marks all over her body. Damn, I love my kids, but right now, I want them gone. If they were older, I would give them keys to the car and a wad of cash to get them out of the house, I think as I walk down the hall towards the bedroom.</p> <p>\u201cHey, when I call you, you come to me; don\u2019t yell. Got it?\u201d I ask as soon as I enter the room and make eye contact with my son.</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad,\u201d he grumbles, looking at Spike in my hands, then over to Spike\u2019s cage that is now hanging open. \u201cOh, he got out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he got out,\u201d I say, handing him the damn ferret. \u201cYou need to make sure you lock that up when you\u2019re not playing with him.\u201d I point to the cage.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says, looking at me before going over and putting Spike away.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, I'm hungry.\u201d Jesus, I love hearing her call me Daddy. I look down at my daughter.</p> <p>\u201cI'm making breakfast now, beautiful.\u201d I run my hand over her soft hair.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she sighs before picking up her doll, sitting down on the ground, and brushing its hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you two when breakfast is ready,\u201d I tell both of them and ruffle Jax\u2019s hair before leaving the room. I was nervous about him taking to Ashlyn and Lilly, but he has been awesome, and there haven\u2019t really been any jealousy issues. I wonder if that\u2019s because of how much Jax has taken to Lil; there are times when he seems unsure, but she is always affectionate with both of the kids. I walk back into the kitchen and finish putting the stuff together for making pancakes...well, I add water to the mix. I\u2019m getting ready to start putting pancakes on the griddle when out of the corner of my eye I see Lilly come around the corner, looking adorably sleepy. Her hair is up on the top of her head, her face rumpled with sleep. She still had my t-shirt on, but I can see she\u2019s put on a pair of sleep shorts underneath. We both just stand staring at each other. All I can think is that I want this every day, and I would kill to have it. I watch fascinated as her hand goes to her neck and her cheeks turn a light pink. I know she has seen the marks I left on her. I couldn\u2019t help it; she makes me crazy, and I want her to always know that she belongs to me. My eyes drop to her mouth, then to her br**sts. I can see the tips of her ni**les through my shirt. When my eyes make it back to hers, the pink of her cheeks have darkened. \u201cHi,\u201d she says quietly.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d I hold out my hand. She looks at it for a second before taking a step towards me.</p><p>\u201cUm...where are the kids?\u201d She starts to look around, but before she has a chance to take her eyes off me, I wrap my hand around the back of her neck and pull her closer so her body is fully against mine.</p><p>\u201cThe kids are playing.\u201d I wrap my other arm around her waist, dragging up the back of my tee so I can run my fingers along her skin. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d I ask, leaning down to press my mouth to hers.</p> <p>\u201cO-okay.\u201d Her stuttered word is said against my lips. I smile, pulling her closer, my face going into her neck, and her subtle smell of lavender makes me groan.</p><p>\u201cAre you sore?\u201d I ask against her ear before licking her lobe and pulling it between my lips. \u201cOr can you still feel me here?\u201d I run my hand down her back, over her ass and in-between her legs from behind. She gives a soft moan and I lean back so I can see her face when she answers me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d I can feel her hand on my arm tighten, and the nails of her other hand sink into the skin of my side. My fingers that are resting between her legs flex, and she comes up on her tiptoes. \u201cThe kids,\u201d she says as her mouth comes to mine. I put my mouth on hers, licking her lips, making her open up for me. I love the way she tastes. And I love that she gives just as good as she gets. Her tongue chases mine. I feel a rumble start up my chest, and I know I need to stop this before it gets out of hand and I put her on the counter, spreading her out. I reluctantly pull my mouth away from hers, shoving my face into her neck, trying to get my control back.</p><p>\u201cYou want coffee?\u201d I ask into her hair, not moving my hands from her neck or her pu**y.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she hisses out, and I know she\u2019s not saying yes to coffee, but to the feel of my hand. I can feel her heat through the thin material of her shorts, and I fight with myself about sliding my hand up the leg of her shorts so I can feel how wet she is.</p><p>\u201cCome sit with me while I make breakfast.\u201d I remove my hand from between her legs, moving her so that her back is to the counter where I can easily pick her up, setting her next to the stove. I move around, getting her a cup of coffee before coming back to her. \u201cHow did you sleep?\u201d I ask, handing her the cup of coffee and stealing a quick kiss.</p><p>\u201cReally well.\u201d She smiles, tilting her head to the side like she\u2019s studying me. \u201cHow did you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than I have in years. I like knowing that my family is all under one roof. I like waking up to the feel of you tucked in next to me.\u201d I watch her face turn soft, and I can\u2019t help but kiss her again. \u201cDo you feel up to going to look at cars today?\u201d I ask, pouring pancake batter onto the griddle.</p> <p>\u201cCash.\u201d The way she says my name is like a full conversation; she doesn\u2019t even have to say anything else, and I already know exactly what she is thinking.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that came out wrong,\u201d I say and look over at her. \u201cIt sounded like a question, and it wasn\u2019t. We\u2019re going to go look at cars today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d I hear her say under her breath, and I chuckle.</p><p>\u201cBabe, you\u2019re not driving that piece-of-shit anymore; it\u2019s not safe or reliable.\u201d I pull out a spatula from the drawer and start to flip the pancakes. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m surprised I lasted this long. I was thinking about slashing your tires; I hate that f**king car.</p><p>\u201cFine, I know I need a new car. I will just use some of my rainy day money for a down payment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you not here when we had this conversation before? I know I told you I'm buying you a new car.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCash,\u201d she says again, then shakes her head, \u201cI need to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLil, you have done more than your fair share over the last few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just come in and take over, Cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not taking over, but if there is a way that I can make things easier for you and Ashlyn, then I'm going to do it.\u201d I watch as she rolls her eyes before taking a sip of coffee. \u201cThat\u2019s one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asks, looking confused.</p><p>\u201cOne spanking for rolling your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do know that I'm a grown woman, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can\u2019t threaten me with spankings.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFirst, it\u2019s not a threat. Second, I can see that you want it. Every time I tell you that I'm going to spank you, your eyes light up and you wiggle around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not,\u201d she huffs out, wiggling on the counter, making me laugh as she glares.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast is ready,\u201d I yell down the hall a few seconds later. I hear the kids\u2019 feet pounding down the wooden floor before coming around the corner into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYay, pancakes!\u201d Jax yells.</p><p>\u201cYippieee! Can I have chocolate chips in mine?\u201d Ashlyn asks, and Jax looks at her like she\u2019s a genius.</p><p>\u201cAnd mine,\u201d he says, climbing up onto one of the stools.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, guys, we don\u2019t have any, but we can get some for next weekend,\u201d I say, putting pancakes on plates for both of the kids. Lilly jumps down from the counter, goes to the fridge, and pulls out orange juice, pouring it into two plastic cups and setting it in front of each of them. Then she takes a banana and cuts it in half, putting a section on each of their plates before doing the same with an orange.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asks when she catches me watching her closely. She is such a good mom. Last night in the shower, when she brought up the fact that we had used a condom when she got pregnant with Ashlyn, got me thinking. What are the chances that I could have used protection with two different women and gotten them both pregnant? That shit is as unlikely as winning the lottery. And as much as it pisses me off that it happened, and that Jules is most likely behind that shit, I have a hard time being pissed about it. Or at least being pissed at the situation. If Lil didn\u2019t get pregnant, Ashlyn wouldn\u2019t be here. Lil would probably be married to some dude, having his kids, and I would have never heard from her again. She would have been the one who got away.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I pull my eyes off her, adding more pancakes to the griddle before pulling down a plate for the two of us.</p><p>\u201cCan we go to the zoo?\u201d Ashlyn asks, and I throw my head back laughing; she always wants to go to the zoo.</p><p>\u201cNot today. Today we\u2019re going shopping for a new car for your mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She pouts before shoving more food into her mouth. Just then, the doorbell starts to go off. I look over at Lilly and she shrugs. I\u2019m not expecting anyone. Even before I make it to the door, I can hear kids yelling and people talking. \u201cShit,\u201d I mutter to myself, unlocking the door.</p><p>\u201cTook you long enough,\u201d Trevor complains, shoving his way inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are y\u2019all doing here?\u201d I watch as every person in my family files into my house.</p> <p>\u201cPut a damn shirt on.\u201d Asher shoves past me, covering November\u2019s eyes, making her and I laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou know this is my house, right? And it\u2019s a Saturday,\u201d I tell him, locking the door behind Nico after he comes inside.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but we thought that we could all plan something to do for the day,\u201d Trevor explains, going into the kitchen. I see Lilly\u2019s eyes get big; she\u2019s standing behind the counter, pulling at the hem of my shirt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, you guys. I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d she says, running off. I groan; I don\u2019t want this. I want to have a relaxing day with my woman and kids.</p><p>\u201cCan ya\u2019ll watch the little ones while I go get dressed?\u201d I don\u2019t even look at my brothers; I look at Liz and November when I ask my question.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d November says, and Liz nods. I make my way into my bedroom just in time to see Lilly taking my shirt off and a bra in her hand. She jumps when she hears the door close behind me.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you may have gone a wee bit overboard?\u201d she asks, holding her arms out to the side but gesturing with her hands to all the marks I left on her.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d I bite my lip, looking her over. Yeah, okay, it may have been overkill, but f**k if I care. If anyone were to get her clothes off, they would know that she is taken.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing it\u2019s cold and I can wear sweaters and jeans,\u201d she mumbles under her breath, putting on her bra. When she pulls down her shorts, her eyes meet mine. \u201cIt looks like I got attacked even between\u2014\u201d she starts to say between her legs, but points instead.</p><p>\u201cI would say I'm sorry, but I would be lying.\u201d I walk over to the dresser, grabbing a shirt and a pair of jeans. I toss the shirt on the bed, kick off my sweats, and step into my jeans, making sure to tuck myself in so I don\u2019t zip my dick\u2014that shit is never fun. When my head comes up, Lilly is watching me closely. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to wear underwear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She shrugs, looking at the piece of satin in her hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d I groan, seeing her intentions.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut them on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? If you can\u2014\u201d I cut her off, pulling her close and putting my mouth on hers.</p><p>\u201cAs it stands right now, I'm going to have a hard enough time being around you today. If I know you\u2019re not wearing underwear, that is going to do me in. And you\u2019re likely to end up bent over in every small room with a little bit of privacy that we come across,\u201d I tell her, biting down on her bottom lip before licking it. Her mouth forms an O before she gets a small devious smile on her face. \u201cShit.\u201d I press my now-hard c**k into her belly. \u201cDon\u2019t f**k with me, baby.\u201d I wrap my arms around her, hugging her before kissing the top of her head. \u201cLet\u2019s go see what everyone is up to, then figure out a way to ditch them,\u201d I say, kissing her once more on the mouth before stepping away and putting on my shirt.</p><p>I make my way out of the bedroom after feeling Lilly up and helping her put on her panties. I smile thinking about the way I got her to put them on. I fix my face into a firm mask before walking into the kitchen. Asher is now standing in the kitchen in front of the griddle, flipping pancakes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wanted to come and see what you guys were doing today,\u201d Trevor says, and I almost laugh. \u201cWell, we\u2019re not going to be here; we\u2019re going to get Lilly a car,\u201d I tell them all before picking up my plate off the counter and finish eating.</p><p>\u201cSo we can all go,\u201d Nico says, and everyone else agrees. I look around, seeing that there is no real way to get out of this, so I may as well just have them tag along. Who knows, maybe if they are there with me, Lilly will be more agreeable. I know she won\u2019t argue in front of everyone. I rub my hands together thinking I couldn\u2019t have planned this better if I tried.</p><p>\u201cAll right, we\u2019ll leave after Lilly finishes eating breakfast,\u201d I tell everyone.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not buying me a brand new car that costs more than I make in a year,\u201d Lilly yells, walking back and forth in front of all of us. We\u2019re all standing outside the dealership. Phil is looking around nervously; I don\u2019t blame the poor guy. When we first got here, I told him what I wanted for her, and he of course, being a salesman, took us to the top-of-the-line model with all the bells and whistles. The newest model GMC Acadia was nice; actually, it was perfect, and she was getting it whether she wanted it or not.</p><p>\u201cBaby, I am. It\u2019s safe and good on gas,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cI will have to sit on a phone book just to see over the damn steering wheel. How the hell is that safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, the seats are completely adjustable,\u201d Phil says, earning a glare from Lilly. And laugher from our group.</p><p>\u201cThis is not okay.\u201d She stomps her foot.</p> <p>\u201cLook, maybe we can compromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompromise?\u201d she yells, throwing her hands up in the air. \u201cLike what? I say you\u2019re not going to buy me a car, and you force it on me? That kind of compromise? Yeah, no thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, okay? I want you to be safe, and this is one of the safest cars available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, we have a Mercedes Benz tha\u2014\u201d I look up and narrow my eyes on Phil. \u201cNever mind,\u201d he mumbles before walking off.</p><p>\u201cTake a deep breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d she whispers, and I see tears in her eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t want a car to begin with, and I don\u2019t want that thing.\u201d She point at the Acadia.</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t. And I don\u2019t want you to spend that kind of money on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, if you were to sue me for back child support, you would be rolling in the dough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never do that,\u201d she gasps.</p><p>\u201cLil,\u201d I laugh, running my fingers along her jaw, \u201cI know that you wouldn\u2019t, but the point is that you could. I haven\u2019t been around since Ashlyn was born. I wasn\u2019t there to help you with bills or expenses. I want you to have nice things. There is no reason for you to struggle anymore. So please, let me do this for you,\u201d I beg. It\u2019s not lost on me how different this situation is compared to the one I was in with Jules. Jules wanted everything; she was never satisfied, and if I took her to a car dealership and told her to pick out a new car, she would have left me filling out the paperwork while she took off in her new ride.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but can you just do this one thing for me? I want to know that you\u2019re safe, and that when you have my kids in the car with you, they\u2019re safe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say \u2018this one thing\u2019, but I know that you\u2019re going to have a million other things.\u201d She pouts.</p> <p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re really f**king cute when you\u2019re upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so...\u201d she stops, like she\u2019s trying to think of a word to use to describe me.</p><p>\u201cAnnoying,\u201d Liz supplies, laughing.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lilly says, looking at Liz. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are so annoying,\u201d she says, looking back at me.</p><p>\u201cBut you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d she grumbles, so I bend her back and kiss her until I feel her body relax, and I know I have her right where I want her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go get your new car,\u201d I say kissing her again before swinging her up into my arms. \u201cGet the paperwork ready, Phil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn it.\u201d He smiles.</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d I hear Ashlyn yell.</p><p>It is official. My family is f**king crazy. Yes, they mean well, but they need to leave; I want to be alone with my woman and kids. I look around the room, realizing that everyone is settling in, getting comfortable like they plan on staying all f**king night.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k is your problem?\u201d Nico asks, making my eyes narrow.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on? You guys have never all stopped by on the weekend. And now it seems like you\u2019re never going to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wanted to come show our support and prove that we do like Lil,\u201d he says, looking into the kitchen where she and November are standing.</p><p>\u201cFirst, don\u2019t call her Lil. Second, since when have you liked her?\u201d I ask, watching Lilly laugh at something that November says.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s grown on me, and I know that it\u2019s not some game or a show that she\u2019s putting on for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLil\u2019s not like that,\u201d I tell him, taking a pull from my beer.</p><p>\u201cSo you can call her Lil, but I can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d I shrug.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, can we go outside?\u201d Ashlyn asks, coming to stand in front of me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby, let\u2019s go get your coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming too,\u201d Asher says.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Trevor says.</p><p>\u201cOh, me too,\u201d Nico says in a high-pitched girl\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re silly, Uncle Nico,\u201d Ashlyn says giggling, making Nico smile. He bends, picking her up and holding her upside-down.</p><p>\u201cDo you still think I\u2019m silly?\u201d he asks, bouncing her up and down, making her laugh louder. I look up and see Lilly watching; our eyes meet for a second before hers go to Nico, going soft. She loves that Ashlyn is able to experience this; being an only child and her parents\u2019 siblings living so far away when she was growing up, she wasn\u2019t able to spend much time with her aunts and uncles.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re not silly-y-y-y,\u201d Ashlyn squeals before Nico rights her and sets her feet on the ground, making sure she is stable before letting her go and ruffling her hair.</p><p>\u201cAll right, get your jacket and see if Jax wants to go out with you,\u201d Lilly says, walking into the living room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou good, baby?\u201d I put my arm around her waist, kissing her hair.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She leans in, wrapping her arm around my back. \u201cShould we order pizza for everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, just as everyone else says yes, and all the kids start yelling, \u201cPIZZA!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney,\u201d Lilly whispers, her fingers digging into my side. I look into her eyes and shake my head.</p> <p>\u201cJesus, fine, you girls call it in, and me and the boys will go pick it up,\u201d I tell her, kissing her forehead before dipping my head to the side and whispering into her ear, \u201cYou owe me later.\u201d I watch her face turn a light pink before hiding it against my chest. \u201cLove you, Lil,\u201d I say into the hair at the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cLove you, too,\u201d she says, her words muffled by my shirt.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019m going to take the rug rats outside. Let me know when you guys order the pizza so we can go pick it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she mumbles. I tilt her head back with a thumb under her chin so I can kiss her. The second my lips touch hers, I pull her a little tighter against me, wanting to absorb as much of her into me as I can.</p><p>\u201cStop being gross!\u201d Jax yells.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s icky,\u201d Ashlyn says, and Lilly smiles against my mouth.</p><p>\u201cGet used to it,\u201d I can hear my oldest niece July say, and I smile, rubbing my nose against Lilly\u2019s before pulling away.</p><p>\u201cAll right, let\u2019s go.\u201d I throw out a hand towards the door and watch as all the kids start to run outside.</p><p>\u201cSo I did a background check on Lilly,\u201d Nico says once we\u2019re outside and all the kids are running around screaming. His words catch me off guard and I turn to look at him.</p><p>\u201cSay what?\u201d I ask. I can feel my body preparing to attack.</p><p>\u201cLook, I did it a while back after the first time you saw her. I wanted\u2014\u201d That was it; I couldn\u2019t take anymore. I looked around, seeing if anyone was watching us before putting him in a headlock. We have all been fighting since we were kids; yes, we all love each other, and yes, we are close, but we are male, and sometimes you had to let that shit out through your fist. I pull his head down low so that if any of the kids were to see us, they would think that we are just horsing around.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to say this one f**king time, and I want to make sure you hear me, so I\u2019m going to speak really slowly.\u201d I tightened my arm around his neck, and it barely registers that he isn\u2019t fighting back. Nico is as big as Asher and has filled out even more since working for Kenton, and I know if he wanted to, he could put me on my ass any other time, but right now, I\u2019m so pissed that I feel like The Hulk. \u201cLilly is off limits. She is not Jules; she\u2019s not some chick that I\u2019m just f**king with. She is someone I have history with. And the person I plan to spend the rest of my life with. So I\u2019m gonna tell you like I told Dad\u2014if you\u2019re not on Lil\u2019s side, you\u2019re not on my side. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k?\u201d I hear before I\u2019m being pulled away from Nico. I brush Trevor and Asher off and right myself.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool; we\u2019re cool,\u201d Nico says, holding up his hands.</p><p>\u201cAre we cool? Tell me what I want to hear.\u201d I look at all three of my brothers. \u201cYou three all need to tell me that you\u2019re on her side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, chill, we\u2019re all on Lil\u2019s side,\u201d Trevor says softly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t f**king call her Lil,\u201d I growl, and Nico laughs.</p><p>\u201cLook, we get it, and we\u2019re all sorry,\u201d Nico says smiling.</p><p>\u201cSo why the f**k did you have a background check done on her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to see what she\u2019s been up to,\u201d he mumbles, and I run my hands down my face.</p><p>\u201cI love you all, but I know what I'm doing. This situation with Lil is stressful enough for her. If she finds out that you\u2019re running background checks or anything else,\u201d I tug my hat off and run my hands though my hair, \u201cthat might send her running.\u201d I close my eyes and shake my head. When I open my eyes back up, I look at the three of them. \u201cI have to tell you, if she runs, I'm following her. Even if that means moving to another state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only reason I said anything was because I wanted you to know that I didn\u2019t think she would commit check fraud,\u201d Nico says, looking worried.</p><p>\u201cI already knew that without you telling me you did a background check, dick. It\u2019s called trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, if you ever did something like that to November, I would kick your ass!\u201d Asher says, glaring at Nico.</p><p>\u201cYep, I would f**k you up if you did that shit to Liz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t do anymore shit like that,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou have my word.\u201d Nico nods. \u201cShe\u2019s good for you. I see that, and I can tell she loves you and Jax,\u201d Nico says.</p><p>\u201cJust, all of you, stay out of my love life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t had a love life in a long time; we\u2019re all waiting to see what happens,\u201d Asher chuckles.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t The Real Housewives; this is my life!\u201d I shout.</p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s a good show,\u201d Trevor mumbles.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all idiots,\u201d I toss over my shoulder as I walk off to join the kids. A few hours later, after everyone has left and the kids are in bed, Lil and I are cuddled up on the couch watching Ridiculousness, laughing our asses off at the stupid things people do, when she reaches over, grabbing the remote and pausing the TV.</p><p>\u201cThank you for having everyone over today,\u201d she says, turning towards me.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want them here,\u201d I tell her, and her eyebrows come together.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t invite them. They just showed up. All I wanted to do today was relax with you and the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says, her eyes searching my face.</p><p>\u201cThey wanted to prove to you that they\u2019ve got your back. They do care about you, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts.\u201d I cover her lips with my finger. \u201cThey know that they shouldn\u2019t have placed you in the same category as Jules. They wanted to show you that we are all family, and we all stick together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really like them all. And I'm happy they have been here for you,\u201d she says, leaning in and kissing my chest before turning her body back around and laying her head against my chest. Then she lifts the remote in her hand towards the TV and the sound of Rob Dyrdek\u2019s voice fills the room. I sit watching the show, but not really seeing it. My mind is full of thoughts about the past, and if I'm lucky, what the future will hold for all of us. I hold Lil a little closer when I hear her laugh. This is my boom. I knew it years ago, and I know it now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 7</p><p>Lilly</p><p>\u201cStay away from my husband.\u201d I look up, along with every child in my classroom.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d I stand up from where I was sitting on the floor in a beanbag chair having story time.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to stay the f**k away from my husband!\u201d It takes a second for me to realize who she is and who she\u2019s talking about. She looks different from the last time I saw her at Cash\u2019s parents\u2019 house; her once brown hair is now blonde, and she\u2019s wearing jeans and a sweater that is cut low, showing way too much cle**age and it looks like she has lost twenty pounds.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk in the hall,\u201d I say softly. I have a classroom full of seven and eight year olds; I don\u2019t need her to start yelling and screaming in the middle of my classroom.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you in the f**king hall. I want you to tell me that you will stay away from my husband.\u201d I walk to the door of my classroom. Once there, I turn slightly to look at my students.</p><p>\u201cMolly, will you please finish reading the rest of the story to the class?\u201d Molly stands, picking the book up off the floor before sitting in my chair. Once I see that she is seated, I turn to face Cash\u2019s ex.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just step out into the hall.\u201d I step out, hoping that she will follow me and not cause a scene in front of my students.</p> <p>\u201cI told you already, I\u2019m not talking to you in the f**king hall. I am not talking to you at all. The only thing that I want is for you to tell me that you are going to stay the f**k away from my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you please calm down? There are children here and you are scaring them,\u201d I say quietly, stepping further into the hall. She finally steps out with me. I take a breath, feeling better knowing that she is away from my kids. I pull the door closed behind me, turning to face her.</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me that you are going to stay away from him.\u201d She crosses her arms over her chest, glaring at me. I am not going to stay away from Cash. I love him. He is amazing with Ashlyn and Jax. He makes me smile, and I am really happy for the first time in a long time.</p><p>\u201cYou and Cash are divorced, and if you have a problem, you need to talk to him about it,\u201d I tell her, using the same tone I use when speaking to students that are misbehaving.</p><p>\u201cHe will always be mine, and when I want him back, he will come back to me.\u201d It was on the tip of my tongue to ask her why she did what she did to me\u2014making me believe that Cash had wanted me to get an abortion while holding her own pregnancy over his head. \u201cI will talk to him.\u201d She leans forward, forcing me back. \u201cI am going to let him know that if he doesn\u2019t stop seeing you, I will make it so he won\u2019t see his son.\u201d</p><p>My stomach drops. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that.\u201d I do not understand why she is so hateful.</p> <p>\u201cYou, bitch, do not get to tell me what I can do. Just stay the f**k away from him!\u201d she yells.</p><p>\u201cLilly, are you okay?\u201d My eyes fly to the door across the hall from mine. David has his head peeking out, looking between Jules and me.</p><p>\u201cYes, fine. Sorry about that, David. She was just leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving until you say the words I want to hear.\u201d I look down the hall, watching as the principal starts heading our way. My pulse speeds up; she looks mad\u2014really mad. Oh God, I was going to get fired. I knew right then that my job had just been lost because of Jules.</p><p>\u201cLilly, what\u2019s going on? You have students, and I have gotten three calls from different teachers about cursing and yelling in the hallway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mrs. Jennings. She was just leaving.\u201d I look at Jules and her face completely changes; her eyes start to tear and she points at me. \u201cShe was yelling and cursing at me. She is having an affair with my husband. I came here to talk to her, to try to get her to understand that I have a child.\u201d She breaks down sobbing. I am stunned. I cannot believe that this is happening.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d I whisper in shock. Mrs. Jennings looks at me with complete disgust, and she would believe it; rumor has it that her husband had been caught cheating on her with a close friend.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d My voice is so quiet it can hardly be heard over the sounds coming out of Jules\u2019s mouth.</p> <p>\u201cLilly, I am going to have to ask you to wait in my office while I find someone to take over your class for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Jennings, please.\u201d She glares at me, pulling Jules into her arms.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get your bag from your classroom and wait for me in my office. I will be there shortly.\u201d I look between her and Jules before walking into my classroom. I know it\u2019s pointless to argue with her right now. I turn away from them, walking back into my class where my students are all talking quietly around the reading rug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, you guys, but I am going to be leaving for the day. Mrs. Jennings is going to be sending in another teacher to take over. Until she gets here, pull out your solar project and start working on that.\u201d I watch as they all get up off the ground, going to their desks to start working. I go to my desk and grab my bag, along with a few personal items that I keep in my desk. I want to tell my class how much I have enjoyed teaching them, but I know that they are already upset about the way Jules was acting, and if I say the wrong thing, it could upset them even more. I leave the class, closing the door softly behind me. I walk around Jules and Mrs. Jennings, and head straight for the principal\u2019s office\u2014what a clich\u00e9. When I get there, her secretary shows me in and I take a seat, waiting for my execution. It takes about fifteen minutes for Mrs. Jennings to enter her office, and I know the second I see her face that my job is not salvageable.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Donovan, what happened today is unacceptable,\u201d she says in a tone that makes me shift in my seat.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but if you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am going to be turning your case over to the school board,\u201d she cuts me off.</p><p>\u201cBut if you would\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be put on leave until the board is ready to hear your case. You will be assigned an advisor from the union.\u201d She wasn\u2019t going to let me speak; her own situation wasn\u2019t allowing her to. I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Jennings,\u201d I try again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dismissed until further notification. Your belongings will be packed up and waiting for you in the attendance office. You can pick it up any time after tomorrow.\u201d I sit there for a second, trying to come up with something to say, but no words are making it from my brain to my mouth. \u201cThat will be all, Ms. Donovan.\u201d She waves her hand, then looks down at some papers on her desk and starts writing. I\u2019m dismissed. I stand on shaky legs, trying to keep it together, at least until I\u2019m in my car. Once outside, the cool air helps make it easier to breath. I dig around in my bags until I find my keys, fumbling with them until the door unlocks. I sit behind the wheel, laying my head against the headrest. I have no idea what I\u2019m going to do. I open my eyes when there is a tapping on my window. I turned my head, seeing Jules. I\u2019m not going to roll down my window or open my door. I\u2019m done dealing with her. I put my key in the ignition and turn my car on. She starts banging on my window harder, yelling at me to open the door. I don\u2019t even look at her when I click my seatbelt into place before putting the car in drive. That\u2019s when my window shatters. I scream, looking up at Jules as she reaches her hand in, grabbing a handful of my hair. I hit the gas. Pain rips through my skull. She runs with my car for a second before being forced to let go. Tears start streaming down my cheeks from the pain at the back of my head and the stress of the day. I look in my rearview mirror, seeing if I can spot her following me, but she is nowhere in sight. When I pull into a large parking lot, I put my car in park, digging out my phone. I need to talk to Cash and tell him what happened. Once I finally get my phone and call his number, his phone rings once before going to voicemail. I lay my head back for a second before deciding that I may as well go pick up Ashlyn from Susan. When I call her, she tells me that she and Ashlyn took lunch to the jobsite, and to meet her there. I hang up, putting my car back into drive. My hands are shaking the whole way; I don\u2019t even remember driving when I pull up next to Susan\u2019s car. I don\u2019t even think; I hop out of the car, glass falling to the ground at my feet. Nico walks around the corner at the same time, his eyes going from my face to the window, and then to the glass that is now littering the ground. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat the f**k happened?\u201d he growls. Tears fill my eyes. I shake my head, not knowing where to start. He pulls me into his arms, rubbing my back.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k are you doing?\u201d I hear Cash\u2019s voice, and I want so badly to see him, but I can\u2019t lift my head. I think I am in shock; it\u2019s so hard to take a breath.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, Lilly. Breathe,\u201d I hear Nico plead, right before I am turned and arms wrap around me, and the smell that is all Cash washes over me.</p><p>\u201cBaby, what the f**k is going on?\u201d Cash says softly into my ear. I pull at his shirt, needing to be closer to him. I start to cry harder. \u201cBaby, I need you to tell me what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI got fired,\u201d I breathe out, stepping out of his arms. I bend over, putting my hands on my knees, trying to catch my breath.</p><p>\u201cYou got fired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Jules came to my classroom and told me to stay away from you, and then my principal showed up. Jules started to cry, and then I got fired.\u201d I try to get all the words out in-between harsh breaths.</p><p>\u201cWhy is your window broken?\u201d Nico asks. I look up to see Cash\u2019s concerned eyes on me.</p><p>\u201cJules broke it before I could get away,\u201d I tell them.</p> <p>\u201cJules broke your car window?\u201d I nod, hugging my waist. I want to sit down before I fall over. Cash takes two steps, pulling me into him; his hand goes to the back of my head to tuck my face into his chest, and the pain has me crying out. \u201cWhat the f**k?\u201d I put my hand to the back of my head. There\u2019s not a bump, but I can feel a slight bald spot, along with heat coming off the area. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had a handful of my hair when I drove off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm going to f**king kill her!\u201d Cash growls, holding me tighter.</p><p>\u201cYou need to press charges,\u201d Nico says looking at me, and I can see that he is barely holding on to his temper.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to make it worse,\u201d I say, looking up at Cash.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t press charges, there will never be any proof of what she did,\u201d Cash says.</p> <p>\u201cI hate this. Why is she doing this?\u201d I ask, laying my forehead against his chest.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s crazy, baby. I don\u2019t think there is a reason for anything she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did she let you divorce her if she was going to act crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t let me divorce her. She tried to contest it, but her plan fell through when she saw how much money it would cost her to keep playing games. She tried to get custody of Jax, but the judge who had the case, didn\u2019t believe he would be in good hands if placed with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she needs medication,\u201d I say quietly. There is no way someone can act like she does and not need serious help. I pull my head up and look between Cash and Nico, and I can tell they are having a silent conversation. \u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, looking at Nico.</p><p>\u201cI'm going to call the cops and have them meet us here. When they leave, Cash and I can take your car to get fixed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about this? I mean, do you think if we ignore her, she will go away?\u201d I ask, looking between the two of them.</p><p>\u201cFuck no. That bitch is like crabs\u2014you ignore them and they spread,\u201d Nico says. A laugh bubbles up my throat, and I am just about to ask him if he is speaking from experience when he says, \u201cNo, I have not had that shit, so don\u2019t even ask.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlrighty then.\u201d I bite my lip when he glares at me. I know that on the inside he is a big softy, but there are times when I can see an edge of darkness about him. It was the same thing I saw in their cousin Kenton when I met him at a bar-b-que we had a while back, but Kenton\u2019s darkness is right there out in the open. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of the job he does, or the people in his life, but something about him scares me in a way I would never want to be on his bad side. I watch Nico pull out his phone; he walks off before he puts it to his ear.</p><p>\u201cI'm really sorry about this,\u201d Cash says, and my eyes go to him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d He raises an eyebrow. \u201cOkay, she\u2019s your ex, but it\u2019s still not your fault. I just can\u2019t believe that she went so far.\u201d</p><p>He sighs, laying his forehead against mine. \u201cMe either, honestly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said that she is going to get Jax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have full custody. She\u2019s just spouting bullshit.\u201d I wrap my arms around his waist, trying not to think about the chance that Jules could ever get custody of Jax. I know how much Cash has sacrificed for his son; I don\u2019t want anything to jeopardize that.</p><p>\u201cCops are on the way,\u201d Nico says, walking back over to us. \u201cWhen they get here, I want you to make sure that you tell them everything that happened. And I want you to tell them that you are pressing charges and applying for a restraining order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I take a breath, letting it out slowly. It takes about thirty minutes for the cops to arrive. They ask a few questions and take pictures of my car window, and then the back of my head at Cash\u2019s demand. After they leave, I look at Cash and Nico. I can tell that they are up to something. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I ask impatiently.</p><p>\u201cNothing, sugar. Why don\u2019t you go see Ashlyn? She\u2019s in the trailer with Mom. Me and Cash will take your car and get the window replaced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, go inside. When you\u2019re ready, I want you to take my truck and the kids to my house. I will be home later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d I try again, getting sick of people not letting me get a word in. He shakes his head, and then wraps his arms around me, pulling me flush with him. His face goes into my neck, and I can feel him taking a few deep breaths.</p><p>\u201cI want you to go inside and sit with Mom until you\u2019re ready to take the kids home,\u201d he repeats.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm going to get your car fixed. Then I'm going to meet up with my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all,\u201d he says, avoiding my eyes.</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t do anything stupid. And you,\u201d I say, pointing at Nico, \u201cif he gets in trouble, I'm going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Nico smiles, and then looks at Cash. \u201cWhatever you say, sugar,\u201d he says, walking off to my car.</p><p>\u201cPlease be careful,\u201d I say, standing up on my tiptoes, pressing my mouth to his. Cash groans, wrapping his arms around me and plastering me against him.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be long. Hang out with Mom for a while, before you take the kids home. We can order in food if you want.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, you don\u2019t want fish sticks and tatter tots?\u201d I ask, knowing that was the only thing left in our freezer.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d His face looks disgusted at the idea of fish sticks, making me laugh.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I will see you in a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you,\u201d I say, taking a step back. He starts to walk off, and then turns abruptly, walking back to me. His hand goes to the back of my neck and pulls me forward, being mindful of the back of my head, and this time, the kiss is all tongue and teeth, and when he pulls his mouth from mine, I'm completely breathless. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLove you. See you when I get home,\u201d he says. His eyes flash before he turns and walks to my car, climbing inside. I go up the steps of the work trailer and watch as he pulls away. Once I can no longer see him, I go inside and sit with Susan for a while, watching the kids finish a project she has set up for them. While they are occupied, I explain to Susan what happened with the police, and why they took me in for questioning last week. I\u2019m so worried she won\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t do what they accused me of, until she pulls me in for a hug, much like my mother would do. When she pulls away, she puts her hands on each side of my face, holding me gently.</p><p>\u201cYou know I wouldn\u2019t believe you could do something like that.\u201d She pushes my hair away from my face. \u201cYou are an amazing woman, Lilly, and I know you are a good person. You\u2019re good for my son, my grandson, and my family. I hate that I have missed so much time with you and my granddaughter, but now that you\u2019re here, I will do everything in my power to make sure you stay right where you are. You and Cash both deserve to have something good, and it\u2019s not very often that God offers you a second chance at love. I know Cash has told you some of the stuff that went on with Jules, but I'm sure that my son has kept most of that bottled up. I doubt any of us really know everything he went through. He doesn\u2019t like people to feel sorry for him. But as God as my witness, I hope that woman burns in hell for what she did, not only to you and Ashlyn, but for the pain that she has caused\u2014and continues to cause\u2014my son and grandson. I know I shouldn\u2019t wish something like that even on my worst enemy, but she deserves it,\u201d she says, looking over at the kids. \u201cYou both have a lot to be thankful for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I mumble over the giant lump that has invaded my throat.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to thank me. That\u2019s what family does. We may all fight and argue and get on each other\u2019s nerves, but if one of us stumbles even slightly, there is always someone there to lend them a hand.\u201d Her eyes search my face before turning serious. \u201cBe strong for my boys; they need a woman who will not only show them what the power of a strong woman\u2019s love is capable of doing for the soul, but they need a woman who will fight to keep them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love them, both,\u201d I tell her, looking down at Jax, who is helping Ashlyn with the glue bottle. \u201cIf I could adopt Jax as my own son, I would do it in a heartbeat. He is so much like Cash that it\u2019s scary. He has a big heart for such a little guy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I need to know,\u201d Susan says, and my eyes go back to hers, seeing tears fill them. I reach out and pull her in for hug. When we pull away, we\u2019re both a mess with mascara running down our cheeks. The kids both look at us like we\u2019re crazy, and then Jax makes me crack up when he tells us that his Uncle Nico said that girls are weird, and that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t want one.</p><p>\u201cNico isn\u2019t going to know what hit him when he finally finds his girl,\u201d Susan says, and I agree completely.</p><p>\u201cI have a question, and don\u2019t be afraid to say no,\u201d I say later that night when we\u2019re in bed. \u201cI won\u2019t be mad; I promise,\u201d I say, and feel my stomach roll at the thought of him not wanting us.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...do you, um...doyouthinkthatAshlynandIcouldmoveinwithyou?\u201d I ask quickly, trying to get it out. I won\u2019t be able to sleep until I know my daughter and I won\u2019t be homeless. I love Cash, and have wanted him to ask us to move in with him for a while now, but I don\u2019t want to pressure him about it. And Cash is Cash. I figure if he wants us here, he would find a way to make that happen. I feel his body start shaking, and I know he\u2019s laughing. I just have no idea what could be funny about this.</p><p>\u201cAre you laughing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBaby, I have wanted you to move in since I walked you and Ashlyn to your car outside of the Jumping Bean,\u201d he says laughing. Then his eyes search my face and grow serious. \u201cI hated knowing I would have to wait to see you again. And it\u2019s only gotten worse over the last few months. So yes, I want you to move in. I just didn\u2019t want to push you too fast,\u201d he says softly, and I can hear the vulnerability in his words.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s too fast?\u201d I ask, rubbing my face against the skin of his side.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too fast.\u201d He squeezes me.</p><p>\u201cThe kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill be fine. Ashlyn loves being here. Jax loves having you both here. Don\u2019t worry about this right now.\u201d He pulls me so I\u2019m almost fully on top of him. \u201cThe kids are their happiest when we are all under one roof. Right now, I want you to sleep. Tomorrow, we will sit down with the kids and talk to them and just make sure that they are good with us all moving in together, okay?\u201d he asks quietly.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I sigh, laying my head down against his chest and snuggling closer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry about all of this, Lil.\u201d My eyes fly open, and I lift my head to look at him. His eyes are full of pain, and I know that he thinks this is all his fault, but it\u2019s not. His ex is crazy and needs serious help.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d I say, sliding one of my legs over both of his and rolling so I\u2019m sitting on top of him. My hands go to his chest; feeling the hardness of his muscles under my palms makes me rock against him. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault,\u201d I repeat as I rock against him again. I moan when I feel him harden beneath me. His hands slide from my thighs up my waist, under the edge of his shirt. I want to forget about today. All I want is to feel him inside me, and feel the delicious sensations I experience when he takes it over.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asks as his hands move over my skin, leaving a path of fire in their wake.</p><p>\u201cIf you have to ask, then I\u2019m doing it wrong,\u201d I say, grinding down onto him. One of his hands squeezes my ass, the other goes to the back of my neck, pulling my face down to his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing it right,\u201d he says as his mouth takes mine in a deep kiss, my fingers digging into his chest. I pull my mouth away from his, kissing my way down his chest to the edge of his boxers. I pull them down and lick up his length with one long stroke of my tongue. I want him in my mouth, but I really want him inside me, so I roll to my back, lift my hips off the bed and my legs into the air, pulling my panties off and tossing them away. I start to roll back when my ankles are grabbed and crossed above me, then pushed down towards my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I breathe as I feel his mouth suck the skin at the back of my thighs.</p><p>\u201cIf you have to ask, I\u2019m doing it wrong,\u201d he says, and I can hear the smile in his voice. Then he licks me.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I try to move, but in this position, I\u2019m immobile. He licks me again, and this time I can feel his tongue slide lightly over my clit. Before he licks me again, I try to push up to get more contact, but he presses my legs closer to my body.</p><p>\u201cSo pink.\u201d He blows against my wet pu**y. I then feel one finger circling right outside my entrance. \u201cHow long do you think I can keep you on edge before you flip out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long.\u201d I shake my head frantically as I feel him lick me lightly again.</p><p>\u201cHumm.\u201d I feel the vibration against me before he licks again, this time with a little more pressure. He keeps teasing with one fingertip inside me.</p><p>\u201cCash,\u201d I moan, trying to free my legs.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he growls, holding me down. Then his mouth opens over me. I feel like I'm going to come out of my skin if he doesn\u2019t do something...more. I don\u2019t know what comes over me, but his mouth and fingers giving me some yet not enough makes me crazy. Finally, I can\u2019t take anymore, and somehow, I flip him over onto his back and impale myself on him.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d I moan loudly, and Cash sits up, his hand coming up to cover my mouth.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d I can hear the strain in his voice. His hand leaves my mouth, and then his mouth is on mine, my hips rolling as I grind down hard. \u201cFuck, just like that, baby. Fuck me hard,\u201d he groans against my mouth, his words making me take him harder. I\u2019m breathing so heavily that I feel like I\u2019m running a race. I feel warm heat begin to fill my lower belly, and then Cash\u2019s hands are at my br**sts, lifting both, his fingers pinching one nipple as he drags the other to his mouth. His teeth closing around my nipple and then adding suction makes me cry out, and my movements still as I feel my orgasm consuming me. Like a volcanic explosion, red-hot heat flows through my veins before settling and slowing to a lazy flow. I have had orgasms before, but with him, they feel like they are taking me over, so consuming that time stops. My head falls forward then his hands are on my ass, pulling me up before dropping me down his length. I can still feel myself convulsing around him as he grows even larger, and my nails dig into his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cLilly.\u201d He says my name in a deep growl that I swear I can feel in my soul. His movements stop dead, his arms wrapping tightly around me. My face buries in his shoulder. Both our breathing is erratic. \u201cAre you okay, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmmhum.\u201d I breathe against his skin, my eyelids feeling heavy. He lays down with his erection still inside me, his body wrapped around me.</p><p>\u201cSleep,\u201d he whispers into the top of my head. I can hear the steady beat of his heart and feel the rise and fall of his breathing, and like a lullaby, the sound and feel of it puts me to sleep.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Cash</p><p>I wake up with a start and look around. I don\u2019t know what caused me to wake up until I hear another loud bang coming from the kitchen or living room. My stomach tightens as a surge of adrenaline rushes through me. I lean over Lilly\u2019s sleeping body and whisper in her ear that she needs to wake up. She grumbles something, trying to burrow into my side before I shake her gently. \u201cLilly, someone\u2019s in the house. I need you to get the kids and take them both into Jax\u2019s room. In the back of his closet is a hidden door. Go in there and wait for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She rolls of the bed quickly, looking around.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Lil,\u201d I say quietly as another loud bang sounds through the house. I can see Lilly start to panic by the light of dawn coming though the bedroom window. Her face is pale as she comes around to my side of the room, her body shaking. I pull her closer to me. \u201cListen to me,\u201d I tell her a little more firmly. \u201cTake my phone,\u201d I say, handing her my cell. \u201cGo get Ashlyn, take her to Jax\u2019s room, and do as I told you. Get both of them and yourself into the room in the back of Jax closet, shut the door, and call the police. Tell them that there is a break-in. Do not come out no matter what you hear. Do not come out until I come get you, or until the police come get you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she says, looking at the door.</p><p>\u201cIt will be okay,\u201d I tell her, going to the closet and pulling out a baseball bat. For the first time ever, I wish I kept a gun in the house.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d she says, and I nod and open our bedroom door, looking both ways before sending Lilly across the hall. I watch her as she makes her way down to where Ashlyn\u2019s room is, and once she clears the doorway I hear another loud bang. I make my way towards the living room and look around the corner into the kitchen. I hear a cry from behind me, and I know that Lilly can\u2019t find the kids.</p><p>She can\u2019t find them because they are both in the kitchen standing on chairs that they have pulled up to the counter, and they have a bowl between them, along with a bag of flour.</p> <p>\u201cCash,\u201d I hear cried from behind as Lilly plows into me. \u201cThe kids aren\u2019t there,\u201d she says franticly.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I tell her calmly.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I just said the kids aren\u2019t in their rooms, and you don\u2019t care?\u201d she yells. I pull her around the corner and both kids are looking nervously at us; the flour that was on the counter in the bag is now covering both of them, and there is a white cloud of it filling the kitchen. \u201cOh, my God,\u201d she says, leaving my side, rushing into the kitchen, pulling both of the kids in for a hug, and covering herself with flour in the process. \u201cWhat are you guys doing?\u201d she asks them, looking around and seeing that they have made a huge mess.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re making you breakfast,\u201d Jax says sheepishly, looking at me then around the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s five in the morning,\u201d I say, putting the bat down before I cross my arms over my chest, looking around at the flour-bomb they set off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s your birthday,\u201d Ashlyn says, looking around before looking at me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and we wanted to make you breakfast in bed as a surprise,\u201d Jax says with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cThat was very nice of you both,\u201d Lilly says, looking over at me with her arms wrapped around the kids. I can\u2019t even speak; all I can do is look at my kids and woman. \u201cThat was really sweet, right, baby?\u201d she asks softly, the look on her face causing a slow burn to fill my chest. I nod because I can\u2019t speak. \u201cWhat do you guys say we get this mess cleaned up while Daddy goes and lays back down, and we can still take him breakfast in bed?\u201d she asks the kids.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not in trouble?\u201d Jax asks.</p> <p>\u201cNo, honey, you\u2019re not in trouble,\u201d she says, kissing the top of his head, \u201cbut let\u2019s get all this flour cleaned up, okay?\u201d They both agree, and then get down off the chairs. Jax goes and gets the broom, while Ashlyn goes and gets the dustpan. Lilly comes to me, wrapping her arms around my waist. I\u2019m barely holding on to my emotions. \u201cGo back to bed, Daddy, so the kids and I can bring you breakfast,\u201d she says softly, smiling. I nod again, kissing her forehead before I turn and walk back to our room and straight into the bathroom, where I turn on the faucet and splash cool water on my face. My hands gripping the basin, my head down, I take a few breaths before I look at myself in the mirror.</p><p>My hair is a mess, and the stubble along my jaw is darker than normal. My eyes are crystal clear, and I can see only happiness in them. There is no sign of self-hate in my eyes anymore. I used not to even be able to look at myself in the mirror without cringing away. I hated my life; my son was the only thing who made every day worth fighting for. Now, I have a family with the first woman I ever loved. The only woman I have ever loved, besides members of my family. Lilly is someone who I will never take for granted, because I know how it feels to be without her and the light that she brings into my life. When I looked into Lilly\u2019s eyes in the kitchen and saw the same happiness shining back at me, it almost brought me to my knees. I take a few deep breaths before turning off the water. I go back into the bedroom and sit on the bed. I can hear laughter coming from the kitchen, and I can\u2019t help but smile when I hear the sound. I sit back against the headboard, pull out my iPad, and start searching for engagement rings. I have known since the beginning that I would ask Lilly to marry me, but having her live here over the last few weeks has only solidified that thought in my brain. I know that she has been worried about her case coming up in the school board and finding a job, but I like her home with the kids while I'm at work. I like knowing that my kids are getting the same thing I had growing up. I finally find a style of ring that I think Lilly will love, but I'm going to take the picture to the jewelry store in town and see if he can have something custom-made with a few changes to the design. I close down the web page when I hear the sound of feet coming down the hall, then the door is swung open and Ashlyn yells, \u201cSurprise!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe already knows we were making him breakfast,\u201d Jax says.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Ashlyn says back, sticking out her tongue.</p><p>\u201cHey, now, none of that,\u201d Lilly says, smiling and walking to the bed carrying a tray that has pancakes with chocolate chips, eggs, and bacon, along with a small box that is wrapped in blue paper and a card.</p> <p>\u201cHappy birthday, Daddy,\u201d Ashlyn singsongs, climbing up onto the bed.</p><p>\u201cThank you, baby,\u201d I say, pulling her up onto my lap.</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday,\u201d Jax says, climbing up onto the bed as well, and I pull him into my other side and kiss the top of his head.</p><p>\u201cThanks, little dude,\u201d I say, my voice hoarse.</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday,\u201d Lilly says, looking between the three of us before her eyes meet mine, and I can see that tears are filling them.</p><p>\u201cThank you, babe.\u201d I mouth the words to her because I can\u2019t seem to speak. She nods before setting down the tray.</p> <p>\u201cCan I have some of your pancakes?\u201d Ashlyn asks, and I look down at her and laugh.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Jax says, making me laugh harder.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more in the kitchen. I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Lilly says, leaving the room. She comes back a few minutes later with another tray, this one with three plates, two juices, and a coffee. She sets the tray on the bed before climbing up to sit facing us. We all sit on the bed eating breakfast, and once we are done, I set my gift and card on the bedside table and take the plates into the kitchen, telling them that I would be right back. When I come back to the room, I sit back down with a kid on each side of me. I put the gift in my lap so I can read the card. On the front of it is a guy in jeans and a shirt; there is a little window, and when opened, the shirt says SuperDad. I smile before putting down the card, picking up the box, and looking at it for a few moments.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna open it?\u201d Ashlyn asks, looking worried. I feel Lilly rub my leg, and I look at her and smile. I start to tear the paper away slowly.</p><p>\u201cDad, just open it,\u201d Jax says, eyeing the box like he wants to take it out of my hands and do it himself. I finish opening it and pull the small box out, lifting the lid. Inside is a pendent on a ball chain. \u201cIt\u2019s backwards,\u201d Jax says. I use one finger and flip the pendent over, and on the other side are three stones going down the center of it. All three different colors each represent the three people surrounding me.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d Ashlyn asks, sitting up on her knees.</p><p>\u201cI love it,\u201d I tell her, looking up from the pendent into her smiling face.</p><p>\u201cThat one is Jax. This one is me. And that one is Mommy,\u201d Ashlyn explains, pointing out each stone.</p> <p>\u201cAre you gonna put it on?\u201d Jax ask.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whisper, taking it out of the box, holding it up, and looking at it before I slide it around my neck.</p><p>\u201cYou look pretty,\u201d Ashlyn says.</p><p>\u201cBoys don\u2019t look pretty; they look handsome or cool,\u201d Jax tells Ashlyn.</p><p>\u201cNuh-uh, Mommy says Daddy is the prettiest boy that she ever saw.\u201d My eyes go to Lilly and I raise an eyebrow; she shrugs before covering her mouth, laughing at the look Jax gives her.</p><p>\u201cBoys aren\u2019t pretty, right, Dad?\u201d Jax asks me, and I turn to look at him. I don\u2019t even answer him; I just drag him to me, tucking him under my arm and kissing the top of his head.</p><p>\u201cThank you, guys, for my gift. I love it,\u201d I say, kissing Ashlyn\u2019s forehead. She wraps her little arms around my neck, hugging me tightly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLobe you, Daddy,\u201d she says, and my eyes start to burn.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Dad,\u201d Jax says, hugging my other side.</p><p>\u201cCan we go to the zoo?\u201d Ashlyn asks, pulling her face out of my neck and making me laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou always want to go to the zoo,\u201d Jax says.</p> <p>\u201cThe zoo is fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe zoo is lame,\u201d Jax returns, and they both jump up so they are standing on the bed and proceed to argue back and forth. I lean forward, grabbing Lilly\u2019s hand, dragging her up to me.</p><p>\u201cThank you for this,\u201d I tell her, running my fingers down the side of her face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome; we love you,\u201d she says, laying her head on my chest, her fingers picking up the pendent to look at it.</p><p>\u201cThank f**k,\u201d I whisper into her ear.</p> <p>\u201cDad, we\u2019re not going to the zoo, are we?\u201d Jax groans, flopping down onto the bed dramatically.</p><p>\u201cNot today, little dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Daddy...\u201d Ashlyn whines.</p><p>\u201cAshlyn Alexandra, no whining,\u201d Lilly scolds, and Ashlyn crosses her arms over her chest in a pout.</p><p>\u201cBut I want to see the wions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you keep up the attitude, little miss thing, you won\u2019t be going to the zoo for a very long time,\u201d Lilly says, and I bite the inside of my cheek to keep from laughing at the look on Ashlyn\u2019s face.</p> <p>\u201cCome here, baby.\u201d I hold out my hand and she flops down on top of me, making me grunt.</p><p>\u201cHow about we go do something that everyone will like doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cWell, we could go fishing,\u201d I say. I haven\u2019t gone fishing in a while, and I know that it\u2019s something that Jax enjoys doing.</p><p>\u201cYay! Fishing!\u201d Jax yells.</p><p>\u201cAre we gonna fish for salmon?\u201d Ashlyn asks.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby. Catfish,\u201d I tell her, pushing her hair away from her face.</p><p>\u201cCatfish?\u201d Her face scrunches up, looking adorable.</p> <p>\u201cYep, catfish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre catfish hairy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatfish aren\u2019t hairy,\u201d Jax says, laughing and rolling around on the bed.</p><p>\u201cAll right, guys, if you want to go fishing you need to go brush your teeth and get dressed,\u201d I tell them both and watch as they bounce off the bed and run out the door.</p><p>\u201cSo you guys are going fishing? That\u2019s fun,\u201d Lilly says, and I smile.</p><p>\u201cWe are all going fishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you and the kids are going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe, it\u2019s my birthday, which means it\u2019s my day. So we\u2019re all going fishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She pouts, and I know exactly where my daughter got her attitude.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell Ashlyn about her attitude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have an attitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, so get your ass up and get ready to go fishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLil.\u201d I say her name, bending forward so that I can kiss her until she\u2019s quiet.</p><p>\u201cSo when it\u2019s my birthday, I get to do whatever I want, right?\u201d she asks breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s a new rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Hopefully, the Fifty Shades of Grey movie will be out then and we can go see it,\u201d she says, hopping off the bed and making a beeline for the bathroom. It takes me a second to realize what she said and I walk to the bathroom, opening the door and catching her just as she\u2019s getting in the shower.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to see that movie,\u201d I tell her. I know all about that shit; Asher told Trevor and me all about it.</p><p>\u201cYou said I get to do whatever I want,\u201d she says, and I can tell by the tone of her voice that she\u2019s smiling.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let me clarify that statement. We can do anything you want, as long as it\u2019s something that the kids can be involved in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I will go see it with Liz and November.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you interested in BDSM?\u201d I ask her. When Asher broke the book down for us, he said this dude Grey had a bad childhood, and when he got older he had an urge to dominate the women he slept with.</p><p>\u201cYour kink is enough for me, thank you,\u201d she says, laughing. I pull the shower curtain back so I can look at her.</p><p>\u201cI'm not into kink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d She tilts her head to the side, studying my face.</p><p>\u201cNo, I'm not,\u201d I say firmly.</p><p>\u201cHmm...so what about the time you held me down and wouldn\u2019t let me come? Or the time you tied me to the bed? Or all the times you\u2019ve threatened\u2014which you haven\u2019t followed through, I might add\u2014to spank me? Or what about the time you had me on my knees and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me, I'm into kink,\u201d I breathe. I have no idea where this is coming from. With Lilly, I always feel a need deep in my soul to show her who\u2019s in charge. I glare at her when she starts laughing. \u201cKeep laughing and I'm going to turn your ass pink,\u201d I growl. She moans then puts her ass in my direction.</p><p>\u201cJesus, I think it\u2019s you that\u2019s really into kink,\u201d I say, and I can\u2019t help but to run my palm over the curve of her ass. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to explore this right now, but later, I will definitely find out how kinky you are,\u201d I say, smiling when her cheeks turn rosy. \u201cI'm gonna go check the kids.\u201d I adjust myself before leaving the bathroom. Walking out of the room, I try to think of every baseball stat or piece of construction equipment I know, and not the fact that tonight I'm going to see just how kinky I can get with my woman.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so ugly!\u201d Ashlyn cries as I remove the hook from the catfish\u2019s tail.</p><p>\u201cHe is ugly,\u201d Lilly says, still holding the pole.</p><p>\u201cBabe, I don\u2019t know how you keep hooking them in everything but their mouths, but this is your third one. I hope Fish and Game doesn\u2019t show up.\u201d I smile and she laughs. We have been fishing for over an hour and none of us have caught anything except Lilly, and every time she catches one, it\u2019s never hooked in the mouth; it\u2019s always through some part of the fish\u2019s body\u2014like this one now. Somehow, she caught it right through the tail.</p><p>\u201cYou said when I felt a nibble to tug, and I did what you said,\u201d she counters.</p><p>\u201cI did say that.\u201d I smile, and once I finally have the hook removed, I put another worm on her it for her and set up Ashlyn\u2019s again with the fish dough. She doesn\u2019t like to see the worm on her hook. Jax is sitting next to me, handling his own fishing hook while massacring three worms on it. \u201cDude, you don\u2019t need so many worms.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf the fish are hungry, they will like it.\u201d His little face is scrunched in concentration.</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d I say, finishing with Lilly\u2019s bait and watch as she walks down the long dock. Her tight jeans show off the curve of her ass and her long legs. Ashlyn runs off, following close behind her wearing her life jacket. A few seconds later, Jax follows behind them wearing his life jacket as well. After I get my pole hooked up, I start making my way down dock when Lilly yells that she\u2019s got another one. I watch as she brings it out of the water. The fish is hooked through the mouth this time, his body flopping around. Lilly starts screaming when the fish makes its way towards her; she keeps backing away from him but still has the pole in her hand, so the fish is following her the whole way. I'm laughing so hard, and so are the kids, until Lilly continues her backwards walk right off the dock. She cries out right before there is a loud splash. I have never in my life met someone as clumsy as she is. I shake my head and run down the dock just as Lilly comes back up and starts treading water. She wipes her hair out of her face laughing. Both the kids are cracking up, dancing around the dock.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I did that,\u201d she laughs. I reach down to give her a hand up; she takes it then tugs, and I'm falling over the edge of the dock into the water with her. When I come up, I'm sputtering. I look at Lilly, who is laughing her ass off, then up at the kids, who are looking down on both of us with giant smiles on their faces.</p><p>\u201cYou think this is funny?\u201d I ask, and then start to splash water onto the deck at the kids.</p><p>\u201cNo, Daddy! There are fish in that water!\u201d Ashlyn yells, running away while Jax looks at me, then Lilly, and jumps in.</p><p>\u201cThis is so much better than the zoo,\u201d Jax says, climbing onto my back.</p><p>\u201cCome in, love bug,\u201d Lilly calls.</p><p>\u201cWill the fish bite me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they are all scared,\u201d Jax says.</p><p>\u201cThe water is icky, and it\u2019s too cold!\u201d she says, looking at the water, then at us.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a girl,\u201d Jax yells, then tries to dunk Lilly.</p><p>\u201cI know I'm a girl. I'm a princess. Right, Daddy?\u201d She puts her hands on her little hips and glares at her brother.</p><p>\u201cRight, baby,\u201d I say, putting my hands up on the dock and pulling myself up and out of the water.</p><p>\u201cYou two ready to get out?\u201d I ask, putting a hand down to Jax, who kicks his way over to me. I take his hand and pull him out of the water, and once I\u2019ve gotten him and Lilly out, Jax starts chasing his sister around threatening to hug her, causing Ashlyn to scream and run away from him.</p><p>\u201cThis is way better than the zoo,\u201d Lilly says, and I toss my arm over her shoulder, pulling her into my side. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that warm front came through or this would really suck,\u201d she says with a little shiver.</p><p>\u201cThanks for giving me this,\u201d I tell her, kissing the side of her head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of fun.\u201d We make our way to our blanket that we had laid out on the grass, along with our cooler full of drinks and snacks. Jax runs to the blanket, gets a towel and his extra set of clothes from the bag that Lilly packed. I have no idea how she knew that we would need all that; I guess it\u2019s a mom thing. I take him to the truck to help him get changed and bring back a jacket for Lilly to throw on over her wet clothes. We all sit down on the blanket and Lilly hands the kids each a sandwich before handing me one. Her eyes roll back before she sits forward and pulls out her cell phone from her back pocket.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d she mumbles, looking at her phone.</p><p>\u201cYou said a naughty word,\u201d Ashlyn informs Lil.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she says, smiling.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, babe; we can get you a new one,\u201d I tell her, pulling her phone out of her hand and looking at it. I can see water in the screen, so I know that it\u2019s not salvageable with a bag of rice.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t afford a new phone,\u201d she says, looking at it.</p><p>\u201cWill you stop doing that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to pay for the phone, Lil. You can get a line on my account. It\u2019s past time for you to get a Tennessee number anyways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I really can\u2019t afford it. I still have to pay the lawyer,\u201d she says quietly, looking at the kids. And just like that, I\u2019m reminded of the shit that is still happening around us. That shit, along with my ex, is something that I don\u2019t like to think about. Lucky for us, both have been quiet lately. The case against Lilly has been put on hold due to lack of evidence. And Jules has not made any contact since she went to Lilly\u2019s school and attacked her. The day Lilly showed up at my jobsite in tears from what Jules did to her, it took everything in me not to kill her myself. Not that I didn\u2019t track her down and make it known that if she continued her bullshit I would make her life a living hell. But even though she\u2019s been quiet lately, I know that she is up to something. I just don\u2019t know what.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Lil. You and Ashlyn are mine, and it\u2019s my job to take care of you. So please, let me do my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your job,\u201d she huffs out, looking annoyed.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA job is something you have to do whether you want to or not.\u201d Her eyebrows come together, creating a small crease between them.</p><p>\u201cLil.\u201d I shake my head; she\u2019s so frustrating sometimes. I lean over, running my finger between her brows. \u201cThis is something I want to do. I love taking care of you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to resent me,\u201d she says so quietly that I almost miss it.</p><p>\u201cHow could I resent you?\u201d I run my hand down the side of her face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe, you have to stop doing that. Are you happy?\u201d I ask quietly, looking at the kids. They are now off running around in the grass, chasing birds that keep coming to them because they are dropping bread as they run.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She watches the kids and a smile comes to her face. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to feel like I\u2019m putting all this on you, you know?</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d I laugh, pulling her over to me. \u201cIf you told me that you were going to stay home from now on, that would f**king thrill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like knowing that you\u2019re at home when I get home, and that my kids are being taken care of by you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I didn\u2019t say that you were going to stay home forever, but as long as you are, I\u2019m cool with it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust promise me that you will tell me if you get to a point where you\u2019re not cool with it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s all this coming from?\u201d I ask her, not understanding what\u2019s bringing all these doubts to the surface when we have been doing so well.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just used to working, so me not working is messing with my head. I love being home with both the kids, but...\u201d she trails off, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d I ask when her face pales slightly.</p> <p>\u201cUm...I...it\u2019s nothing.\u201d She shakes her head again and I know it\u2019s not nothing.</p><p>\u201cLil, please talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJules came by yesterday. The kids were down for a nap, and I answered the door not thinking, but I think she realized that I\u2019m living there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to be worried, and when she saw that it was me who answered, she left without really saying anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNext time she comes by, you need to call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, babe, but I will not allow her to f**k with you or my kids.\u201d I take a breath, trying to calm down. And speaking of the devil, my phone starts ringing, with Jules\u2019 name coming onto the screen. \u201cYeah?\u201d I answer on the second ring. Standing, I walk away from the where Lilly is and the kids are playing.</p><p>\u201cSo you moved in that chick?\u201d she asks with venom in her voice</p><p>\u201cLilly is not a chick; she\u2019s my woman, the mother of my child, and soon, my wife. Second, you don\u2019t ever get to question what I do, or when or how I do it. And third,\u201d I growl when I hear her trying to cut me off, \u201cyou do not get to show up at my house unannounced ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I have the right to know if there is a criminal around my son.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that she is a criminal.\u201d I can tell she is smirking; I\u2019ve seen her smug face enough to know what she sounds like when she\u2019s doing it.</p><p>\u201cWho the f**k told you that?\u201d I ask, my gut twisting.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about who told me, just know that I know all about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know shit. Why are you calling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see Jax,\u201d she says nonchalantly.</p><p>\u201cNot today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not today?\u201d she whines, and I clench my fist. She never wants to see Jax, and she never calls to check on him. Even when he had to stay in the hospital with strep, she wasn\u2019t concerned enough to see him.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my birthday. We\u2019re spending the day together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you could come too,\u201d she says in what I'm sure she thinks is a sexy tone. All that shit does to me is make me want to punch something or cut off my dick.</p><p>\u201cHave you lost your damn mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, I want to see our son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will call you tomorrow and set up a time to meet up with you,\u201d I say, hanging up. I lean my head back, looking up at the sky through the trees. I hate that I\u2019m going to have to deal with her ass for the rest of my life. I feel arms wrap around my waist, and my hands go to Lilly\u2019s on my stomach. I look down when I feel arms around each of my legs, and I know that no matter what bullshit Jules pulls, if I have this, I will be happy.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Lilly</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d Ashlyn says from the backseat.</p><p>\u201cI'm not touching you,\u201d Jax says.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d Ashlyn yells this time.</p><p>\u201cI'm not touching you,\u201d Jax repeats, and I can hear it in his voice that he is smiling and really trying to piss off his sister.</p><p>\u201cMommy, Jax isn\u2019t touching me! Stop not touching me!\u201d Ashlyn cries and I laugh. Looking through the rearview mirror, I can see that Jax has a finger close to his sister, but far enough away that he is not actually touching her.</p><p>\u201cJax, leave your sister alone,\u201d I say, trying to sound firm, but it\u2019s really funny so it\u2019s difficult. I never had siblings growing up, so I have no idea what it\u2019s like, but I love how Jax is with Ashlyn. I love that she has someone there for her. And I know that, yes, he picks on her, but let someone else try to pick on his sister and he turns into a twenty-year-old and lays down the law. No one, but no one, picks on his sister except him. Things have been good\u2014no, that\u2019s wrong\u2014things have been perfect...well, that is if you don\u2019t count getting accused of check fraud and losing your job.</p><p>The good thing is that I had my meeting with the school board and my case was dismissed. They were not happy about what happened, but after the union heard my case and saw for themselves the evidence against me was all false, they said I could return to work. And I would, just not at that school. I don\u2019t want to work somewhere where the principal didn\u2019t even give me a chance to speak, due to her own feelings and her own situation. I want to be somewhere that people know me and my character enough to realize I would never do what I had been accused of.</p><p>So for now, I\u2019m a stay at home mom. I love having the kids, but I miss teaching. I have put in an application at the local middle school, and I\u2019m waiting to hear back from them. So, things are going awesome, and we have all settled in. I\u2019d thought that it would be weird living with Cash, but it isn\u2019t; I love it. I love that the kids have each other. I love that I get to wake up to Cash every day. I love him coming home to the kids and me, and having family dinners. I love that his family has started acting more comfortably around me. The only thing that I don\u2019t love is his ex. I know in my head that she is Jax\u2019s mother, but my heart doesn\u2019t like that very much. I hate seeing the disappointment on his little face when she is supposed to show up and doesn\u2019t. When he does see her, I hate the way he acts when he comes back to us. I hate that Cash is subjected to dealing with her when she wants to act like she cares about Jax, then how he has to put up with the aftermath of Jax, and trying to explain to him why his mom is such a bitch. So if not for his ex, things would be perfect, and that is one thing that worries me. When Cash and I were together before, things were like they are now, minus the kids. I\u2019m concerned about getting too comfortable, but at the same time, he makes it so easy to fall back into a place where I feel safe and loved.</p><p>\u201cMommy, where are we going?\u201d Ashlyn asks for the fiftieth time since we got into the car.</p><p>\u201cI told you, love bug, we\u2019re going to the hairdresser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d she sighs, making me laugh. I pull up out front of the salon, park, and hop out of my giant SUV. When I open the back door, both of the kids are standing and waiting for me to help them down. They each grab a hand as we make it into the building. The woman behind the counter greets us right away with a huge smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi, I have a three o\u2019clock appointment with Justin.\u201d She looks over her shoulder into the back of the salon.</p><p>\u201cHe is just finishing up with his client; if you could give him about five minutes, he will be right with you,\u201d she says, looking down at the kids. \u201cDo you guys like to color?\u201d she asks, and they nod. She ducks behind the counter and comes back up with some coloring books and crayons. We go over to the sitting area, and Jax and Ashlyn kneel in front of the table and start coloring.</p><p>\u201cLilly?\u201d I look up when I hear my name being called. My eyes make contact with a very pretty Spanish man, and I say pretty because he has on more makeup than I do.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d I stand, looking down at the kids.</p> <p>\u201cYou both be on your best behavior. I tell them, walking into the back of the salon. The reason I chose this place is because it is one of the only places around that allows you to bring your children with you, and while you are getting your hair done, they watch your kids.</p><p>\u201cThey will be fine,\u201d the girl who was behind the counter when we arrived says, looking over at the kids.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say as my hand is grabbed and I'm dragged into the back of the salon.</p><p>\u201cI'm Justin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d I say as I'm sat down in a chair and a cape is tossed over my shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cI love this color, honey. Who is your stylist?\u201d Justin asks, making me smile.</p><p>\u201cThat would be Nutrisse 6.60,\u201d I say, and smile when his mouth opens and closes like a fish.</p><p>\u201cThis is from a box?\u201d he asks breathily, lifting my hair and letting it run through his fingers.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d I confirm. \u201cI came today to have you cut ten inches of it,\u201d I tell him. Watching him smile.</p><p>\u201cTen inches will leave you hair here,\u201d he says, holding my hair up to just below my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d I smile, looking at him in the mirror.</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure about this? I mean, your hair is so amazing,\u201d he says quietly.</p><p>\u201cWell, I really just want a change, and I think that a new cut is a good place to start,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this then,\u201d he says, pulling a rubber band out from a drawer. I watch as he pulls my hair back into a ponytail at the base of my neck, and then pulls it down some before reaching over and grabbing a pair of scissors. \u201cLast chance, love, then there is nothing I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it.\u201d I grin, watching as the scissors open over my hair and I hear the distinct sound of my hair being cut. Once he has gone through my hair, I watch as it falls down around my shoulders. My first thought is, it\u2019s really short. My second thought is, Cash. He has no idea that I planned on cutting my hair today. I wonder what he will think. Then I look at my hair in Justin\u2019s hand, then back at myself in the mirror, shaking my head back and forth. I already feel lighter. Once he\u2019s done, he stands behind me, gathering my hair before letting what\u2019s left run through his fingers.</p><p>\u201cNow, love, on to the really fun part. When all is said and done, and I walk into the waiting area towards the kids, I feel hot. My red hair sits just above my shoulders in a mass of wild waves and flips. I feel sexy. I loved my long hair, but this cut...something about it just makes me want to hold my head a little higher.</p><p>\u201cMommy, you look so pretty!\u201d Ashlyn yells as soon as she sees me. She jumps away from the table in front of her, running to me.</p><p>\u201cThank you, love bug,\u201d I say, crouching down in front of her. Her little hands automatically go to my hair, bouncing it. I look over at Jax, who is looking like he would rather be anywhere but here. \u201cAre you ready to go, honey?\u201d I ask, and he nods then hops off the chair, grabbing my hand. Once he has it, I stand, and he starts tugging me to the door of the salon. \u201cBye guys,\u201d I call over my shoulder, laughing as Jax drags me behind him. Once we\u2019re out at the car, he drops my hand and looks up at me.</p><p>\u201cI'm starbing.\u201d His head is back and I can\u2019t help but to laugh.</p> <p>\u201cYou had breakfast a couple hours ago,\u201d I remind him, opening up the door so he and Ashlyn can climb in.</p><p>\u201cThat was foreber ago,\u201d he says as he gets into his chair. He buckles in, and so does Ashlyn. I hop in the back to make sure they are both secure before getting out, shutting the door, and climbing into the front seat. \u201cWhat would you like to eat?\u201d I ask, reversing out of the parking space.</p><p>\u201cMcDonalds!\u201d both he and Ashlyn say at the same time. I don\u2019t take them very often, but when I do, we end up spending at least a couple hours. The first thirty minutes is me trying to talk both of them into eating; the rest of the time is spent watching them play in the indoor play area.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, and then wait a second for them both to stop yelling \u2018yippee!\u2019 \u201cBut if we go, you have to promise to eat before you go play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise!\u201d Ashlyn claps.</p><p>\u201cPromise,\u201d Jax says, and I know they are both lying through their adorable little baby teeth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d I moan, my hands in Cash\u2019s hair. Between my legs, his mouth is on me, and his fingers are digging into my thighs. I\u2019m close...so close. My hips try to raise, and his fingers press in deeper, holding me down. \u201cCash,\u201d I whimper, my head arched back as he pulls my clit into his mouth, sucking it. His hands travel down the length of my thighs, spreading my legs farther apart, then down under my thighs to my ass, lifting me up higher into his mouth. His head moves back and forth as his mouth devours me. My hands tug on his hair, trying to pull him off, but all that seems to do is egg him on. \u201cCash!\u201d I call again, using my feet to push up the bed. He growls low, and then wraps his arms around my thighs, putting his mouth back on me. He\u2019s keeping me on the edge; this is torture. It is my new haircut\u2019s fault. The minute he walked into the house when he came home, his eyes got dark and hooded; I felt my pulse speed up and between my legs get wet. He likes it a lot. After he said hi to the kids, he came to me in the kitchen, wrapping a hand around my waist, his mouth going to my neck, his tongue touching me there before his lips traveled up to my ear.</p><p>\u201cLove the hair, babe,\u201d he said against the shell of my ear. \u201cTonight, I'm going to show you just how much I love it.\u201d He kissed the side of my head, his fingers digging into my hip and stepping away.</p><p>I'm brought back to the moment when he fills me with one thick finger. \u201cCome for me, Lil,\u201d he grunts before his mouth covers me again. One finger slides out, and two slide back in. I do as I'm told, my head digging into the bed, my legs fighting to close. Behind my eyes, the world lights up; my body starts to sing and I convulse around his fingers. Before I have a chance to recover from my orgasm, I'm flipped to my stomach. His thighs spread mine a little wider and his hand comes down hard on my ass before he enters me in one long thrust. \u201cHigher,\u201d his deep voice commands as I cry out and lift my ass higher up to him. His hand smoothes over my skin before coming down hard again, the sting from his palm hitting my skin making me tighten around him, bringing me closer to the edge. \u201cHigher, Lil,\u201d he says with another smack. I moan, my hands grabbing the sheets above me, my face going farther into the bed, and my ass tilting higher. \u201cGive it to me, baby; f**k me back.\u201d Another loud smack lands against my ass. This one sets me off, making me pound back against him. My breath is coming in loud pants, my body slick with sweat. \u201cHarder!\u201d I press back harder, his hands grabbing my ass, pulling it up. \u201cThat\u2019s it, baby,\u201d he groans, slamming into me harder. I can feel myself being moved up the bed by the force of his thrusts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to come,\u201d I moan into the mattress. My thighs shaking, Cash brings down his hand yet again.</p><p>\u201cCome for me,\u201d he says, spanking me on the opposite side. I feel the first waves of my orgasm begin to crash over me. My eyes close tightly; I feel like my body is catching on fire. My pu**y starts to convulse, pulling Cash deeper. I cry out; his hands reach forward, wrapping around my br**sts, lifting my upper body back so I\u2019m kneeling in front of him. His fingers pinch my ni**les. The feeling pulling me deeper under. My orgasm blinds me. His strokes become faster before his mouth meets my neck. I can feel his groan all the way to my clit as he finds his own release. His c**k is planted deep inside me. His chest moves quickly up and down behind me, his hands still holding onto my br**sts. My hands go to his at my chest, my fingers interlocking with his. I lean my head to the side, my body completely boneless. \u201cI love the hair,\u201d he says, licking my neck.</p><p>\u201cI think I got that.\u201d I laugh, and I can feel him smile against the skin of my neck. His hands squeeze my br**sts before traveling down over my ribs, along my sides to my hips, pulling me even closer to him. One hand leaves my hip, following the same path before his hand closes around my neck. I can feel my pu**y still convulsing around him with aftershocks.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna shower?\u201d I feel his breath against my skin as he speaks the words, making me shiver.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I tell him and groan when his hips pull away and I lose him and his warmth. I fall forward on the bed and laugh when he starts to tickle me.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, baby. We need to get cleaned up. You and I know the kids are not going to magically start sleeping in until ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, when was the last time I slept past eight?\u201d I ask out loud, not expecting an answer.</p><p>\u201cHow about tomorrow you sleep in and I will take the kids to my mom\u2019s?\u201d he asks as his hands run up my calves and over my ass.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I sigh; his mom has been amazing, and I don\u2019t want her to feel like I'm trying to pawn the kids off on her.</p><p>\u201cMa loves having the kids over. Plus, I think she wanted to do something with them. There is supposed to be a storyteller at the library in town. I think she wanted to keep the kids overnight. And that would be perfect; I wouldn\u2019t mind taking you out on a date or just having you to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I repeat, even though it would be nice to spend some alone time with Cash.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d He rolls me to my back then scoops me up, carrying me into the bathroom before setting me on my feet outside the shower. \u201cI\u2019ll get up in the morning, take the kids to Ma, and then come back and we can spend the morning in bed before going on a date tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you try to make things seem like it\u2019s a question when you know your mind is already made up,\u201d I say, rolling my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat, you don\u2019t want to spend some time with just me?\u201d he asks, taking my hand and pulling me into the shower.</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s not that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just using me for my body, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he asks, and I can\u2019t help but to look over said body and admire every detail. His body is perfect. I watch as the water runs down and over every muscle; his chest has a little bit of hair\u2014just the right amount\u2014and down under his navel is a strip of hair, which makes a path to his perfect cock. \u201cMy eyes are up here, baby,\u201d he says, and I watch his c**k twitch. I lick my lips and hear him groan. \u201cYou\u2019re not helping, Lil,\u201d he says, pushing me under the water. I sputter and wipe the water out of my face.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I glare at him.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t look at me like that. We need to shower and go to bed, and you can\u2019t look at me like that...looking how you do, with your body all wet and slick...fuck,\u201d he growls, his hands sliding along my hips to palm my ass. \u201cLet\u2019s just say that if you look at me like that, neither of us will be getting any sleep tonight.\u201d His hands slide up my back and into my hair, tilting my head back, his mouth coming down on mine, stealing my breath. \u201cNow, tomorrow you can look at me like that all day long.\u201d He smiles, showing off both dimples. \u201cIn fact, I plan on doing a lot of looking of my own.\u201d His eyes leave mine, trailing down my body. \u201cBut for now,\u201d he says, sounding like he\u2019s in pain, \u201cfor now we need to get washed up and go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I agree, even though the space between my legs has begun to throb. I look over him again, my eyes catching on his massive erection.</p><p>\u201cLil,\u201d he growls. My eyes come up.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d I take a step away from him, and grab my shampoo and start washing my hair quickly. I can hear Cash breathing heavily, but I don\u2019t open my eyes. I\u2019m afraid of what will happen if I look at him. I turn around quickly and grab my conditioner to run it through my hair. Then I grab my body wash, washing up while I let the conditioner sit. Once I\u2019m washed, I start to rinse the conditioner from my hair. My head is back, eyes closed, and without warning, I feel his mouth on my nipple and fingers sliding through my folds. My body is still primed from earlier, and it doesn\u2019t take much before I\u2019m moaning my orgasm into the spray of the showerhead.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t shower together anymore,\u201d he states, picking me up. My legs wrap around his waist and he slides inside me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, no more showering together,\u201d I agree as I use my legs to grind down on him. By the time we finish our shower, we\u2019re both exhausted, and it doesn\u2019t take long for either of us to fall asleep.</p> <p>\u201cBaby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d I try not to speak; I don\u2019t want to wake up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking the kids to Ma\u2019s; I\u2019ll be back,\u201d I hear him say, but can\u2019t really process it because I\u2019m still trying to sleep. Then I feel weight hit my forehead and something slide down my cheek.</p><p>\u201cMommy, I'm goin\u2019 to Grandma\u2019s,\u201d Ashlyn says, and I open my eyes to see her up on her elbows looking at me. Her long hair is pulled up in what looks like two lopsided pigtails.</p><p>\u201cOkay, baby, have fun. Give me love before you go.\u201d I roll to my side so I can hug her. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jax?\u201d I sit up to fix her hair.</p><p>\u201cHe was eating,\u201d she says, pulling her little head away from me.</p><p>\u201cHey, I want to fix your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy fixed my hair,\u201d she says, jumping off the bed, her eyes narrowing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I try not to smile. Cash can do no wrong, including her hair apparently. \u201cCan I get a kiss before you leave?\u201d I ask, and she belligerently climbs up onto the bed and gives me a kiss before jumping right back off the bed, leaving the room.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake?\u201d Cash says, coming into the room.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Ashlyn was just in here,\u201d I tell him, getting up on my elbow.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to sleep,\u201d he grumbles, saying something else under his breath. He makes his way to me. His hands come down on each side of me on the bed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to go back to sleep.\u201d He kisses me, punctuating each word. \u201cAnd when I get back, I\u2019m going to climb back into bed with you.\u201d He runs his nose down my neck.</p> <p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d I breathe, feeling my ni**les get hard and between my legs dampening.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, are we weabing?\u201d Jax yells into the room before jumping up onto the bed. His presence is like a bucket of ice water on my libido.</p><p>\u201cWe are leaving, little dude,\u201d Cash says, standing. I sit all the way up; Jax jumps twice before plopping down on top of me, and his little hands come to my face.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re habing a sleep over with Grandma,\u201d he tells me, his tiny face titling back and forth, studying me.</p><p>\u201cI heard; that sounds like fun,\u201d I tell him, running my hand down his soft hair. I have no idea how his mom can stand to be away from him.</p> <p>\u201cDaddy said that we\u2019re going to Awaska.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are,\u201d I tell him, looking up at Cash. I can\u2019t wait to see my parents. I miss them so much, and I know that Ashlyn does too. Jax has been chatting with my dad whenever we\u2019re able to Skype, and my dad has made Jax excited to come visit. I can\u2019t wait to introduce Cash to my parents and show him where I grew up.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see a real life beer,\u201d he says, making me smile because I know he means bear.</p><p>\u201cWell, next week at this time, we will be on a plane,\u201d I tell him. He hugs me quickly, making my heart melt. He jumps off the bed, running out of the room where I can hear him yell, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna see beers!\u201d</p><p>Cash laughs and I turn to look at him. \u201cI thought we weren\u2019t going to tell them that we are going yet,\u201d I say. We both agreed to tell the kids a couple days before we left so that we didn\u2019t have to answer \u2018are we leaving yet\u2019 questions a hundred times a day.</p><p>\u201cI know, but they wanted to come in and wake you, so I told them I would tell them a secret if they let you sleep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t work,\u201d I point out.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got that.\u201d He smiles, leaning down and kissing me again. \u201cAll right, I\u2019m going to go get the hellions to Ma\u2019s; go back to sleep,\u201d he says, and I don\u2019t think I will be able to go back to sleep, but I slide back down into the bed, pulling the cover up over my shoulder. He kisses me once more before walking out of the bedroom. I watch him leave, enjoying the view of his very firm ass in his Levi\u2019s. I can hear him talking to the kids. I hear the kids yell a goodbye and I smile before calling out that I love them. When I hear the door slam, I close my eyes, and before I know it, I\u2019m asleep. I wake slightly when I\u2019m pulled across the bed, and I feel weight and warmth behind me. I start to lift my head. \u201cSleep, babe. We\u2019re kid-free until tomorrow,\u201d he says, and I feel him kiss the back of my head, his warmth seeping into me from behind. I snuggle deeper into him before drifting back to sleep. I wake up feeling warm. I do not want to move, but I really need to pee, so I start to scoot off the bed when I'm tugged back. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Cash asks, his voice rough with sleep.</p><p>\u201cTo the bathroom,\u201d I say, and his hand runs down my hip where his fingers squeeze in.</p><p>\u201cCome back to bed when you\u2019re done.\u201d I roll out of bed, making my way to the bathroom. I make quick work of taking care of business so I can get back to Cash. Once I get back to the room, Cash is sitting up in bed, his back to the headboard, and his shirtless upper-body exposed. I crawl from the bottom of the bed, watching his eyes darken as I make my way up and straddle his waist. His hands slide up my thighs to my ass, pulling me tighter against him.</p><p>\u201cSo what are we going to do today?\u201d I ask, leaning in to kiss the tattoo of Jax and Ashlyn\u2019s names on his chest. Unlike his brothers, he only has a couple of tattoos. This one has his kids\u2019 names intertwined with sharp lines and a floral vine wrapped around them, almost like it\u2019s holding them together. His other tattoo runs down his side along his ribs, and says, \u2018Experience is the hardest kind of teacher. It gives you the test first, and the lesson afterward.\u2019 The script is swirly and looks awesome against his skin. I can\u2019t help but get lost looking at him. His well-defined abs lead down to a deep V that I trace with my fingers.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d He chuckles, and I feel my cheeks get warm as my eyes meet his.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said how about we have a naked house day?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA naked house day?\u201d I repeat, studying his face.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d His hands run up my thighs, and then under my tank top, his hands skimming my waist and over my br**sts as he pulls it off over my head. \u201cNaked house day.\u201d His thumbs run over my ni**les, making me arch closer to him. \u201cThe rules for naked house day are we stay naked all day, no matter what we\u2019re doing.\u201d His mouth covers one nipple; he pulls hard, then releases and blows a cool breath over it.</p><p>\u201cSounds like fun,\u201d I moan, my hands going to his hair as he gives my other nipple the same attention. \u201cDid you just make this up?\u201d I ask as he rolls me over, sliding inside.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d is all he says before I drag his mouth down to mine, wrapping my legs around him.</p><p>\u201cNo more!\u201d I cry as I feel Cash come up behind me. I got away from him ten minutes ago. I thought naked house day sounded like fun this morning, but now it\u2019s seven at night and I\u2019m starving, my legs feel like they are going to fall off, my body is covered in love bites, and all I want to do is sleep.</p><p>\u201cBabe, you\u2019re naked standing in the middle of the kitchen looking sexy as hell. I can\u2019t help it,\u201d he says, his mouth coming to my neck.</p><p>\u201cNo more.\u201d I jump away from him, running to the other side of the counter. \u201cI need food,\u201d I tell him, stepping back when I see that he looks ready to pounce.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, you\u2019re right. I need to feed you,\u201d he says, holding his hands out in front of him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I sigh, my head dropping forward.</p><p>\u201cAfter I feed you, you\u2019re mine again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you take something?\u201d I ask exasperatedly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He smirks, showing off both dimples.</p> <p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be normal for a guy to get hard so quickly after...\u201d I say quietly, looking down at his very hard c**k and waving my hand in its direction.</p><p>\u201cThis is all your fault.\u201d His fist wraps around his c**k and begins moving in slow strokes. \u201cAll I have to do is look at you and I\u2019m ready to go again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFood,\u201d I say, watching as he works himself. I lick my lips and feel my lower belly clench. I have no idea how I can still get wet after the amount of times I\u2019ve orgasmed today.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll feed you,\u201d he says, taking a step closer to me. His free hand goes to my hip, turning me to face the countertop. \u201cPut your hands flat on top and don\u2019t move them.\u201d I do as he says, my br**sts pressing into the cold counter. He uses his foot to spread my legs farther apart; once he has me how he wants me, his fingers run over my clit, making my body jump at the contact. I feel like every nerve ending is exposed; the slightest touch is almost too much. \u201cYou\u2019re wet,\u201d he states, sounding almost surprised. I don\u2019t say anything, just nod my head. I feel his warmth hit my back, his legs bending right before he fills me, forcing me to stand on my tiptoes.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I moan as my fingers dig into the countertop.</p> <p>\u201cI love being inside you,\u201d he groans. He keeps pulling almost all the way out before slamming back inside, each thrust causing my sensitive ni**les to slide over the counter. His hand slides around my waist before traveling down and over my clit. I press back against him, trying to get away from his fingers. Everything that I\u2019m feeling is too much. Without warning, I hear a loud smack and feel the sting from his palm against my ass. My body jumps, and I feel myself become even wetter. I cry out when his fingers pinch my clit, and my body bucks against his as I orgasm. I clench around him. My body burns from the inside out. Lights dance behind my closed eyelids. I know I\u2019m dragging him over with me when I feel his fingers digging into my hips and his loud roar fills the room. His body collapses on top of mine. I can feel his heart beating wildly against my back, his chest heaving up and down.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re trying to kill me with orgasms,\u201d I say into the top of the counter.</p><p>\u201cMy dick is officially rubbed raw,\u201d he groans, sliding out of me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I yell as he picks me up, walking towards the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cGoing to shower,\u201d he says, and I wiggle until I'm out of his arms.</p><p>\u201cNo! No way,\u201d I say, and I don\u2019t even look at him as I run to the room, slamming the bedroom door. I then run to the bathroom, shutting and locking that door as well.</p> <p>\u201cBabe.\u201d I can hear the laughter in his voice as he knocks on the door.</p><p>\u201cNaked house day is over!\u201d I yell before I jump into the shower, trying to wash as quickly as possible before he finds a way to break down the door. Once I\u2019m done showering, I wrap myself in a robe, making sure to tie it tightly around my waist. I\u2019m surprised to see Cash sitting on the side of the bed fully clothed, his hair still wet from his shower he must\u2019ve taken in the kids\u2019 bathroom.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask, backing up when I see him stand and start prowling towards me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you and leave the room,\u201d he says, his arm encircling my waist. My hands go to his chest, trying to warn him off. \u201cJust a kiss, baby, and then I want you to get dressed so I can take you out to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still going to dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promised you I would feed you,\u201d he says, his lips moving softly over mine. I smile against his mouth. His face moves back, his eyes looking me over. \u201cUnless you feel up to getting back into bed.\u201d He smiles when I growl. \u201cGet dressed. I\u2019ll be in the living room.\u201d He turns me around, pushing me towards the closet. I jump when he smacks my ass. I look over my shoulder to see him smiling. \u201cYou have a beautiful ass, baby.\u201d He shrugs, walking out of the room. I walk into the closet smiling.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Cash</p> <p>\u201cOne more flight,\u201d I hear Lilly tell Jax as we board the small plane. I don\u2019t mind flying, but this day has been exhausting. We woke up at five this morning, got both the kids up and ready, then drove the forty minutes to the airport where we caught our first flight. That one took us from Tennessee to Seattle, and once in Seattle, we boarded another flight to Anchorage, Alaska. Once we arrived in Anchorage, we made our way quickly from the terminal to our gate in order to head outside and board another plane to the small town that her parents lived in.</p><p>\u201cI want to sit with Daddy,\u201d Ashlyn says when we all file onto the plane. The seats are all two-by-two, so we have to split up into pairs.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Lilly says as she helps Jax buckle into the seat next to her across the aisle from Ashlyn and me.</p><p>\u201cHow much longer?\u201d Ashlyn asks, and I can tell she\u2019s getting tired. Lucky for us, both kids are pretty well behaved, so we haven\u2019t had any real drama or breakdowns today, but it has been a long day and it\u2019s starting to wear on all of us.</p><p>\u201cForty-five minutes,\u201d Lilly answers. Once all the other passengers are on the plane and the door is closed, the sound of the engines fills the plane. It\u2019s so loud I look nervously over to Lilly who smiles. \u201cThey call these planes pond hoppers.\u201d Lilly laughs when she sees the look on my face. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019re up then back down on the ground before you know it,\u201d she says with a smile as Jax takes her hand. The plane starts to speed up, and I know we\u2019re off the ground when the plane shakes and the sound of the engine gets even louder than before. This has got to be the scariest flight I have ever been on; I feel like the plane is going to rattle apart. About twenty minutes into the flight, Ashlyn has curled up in her seat with her head against my ribs. I look over at Lilly and Jax, seeing that they are both asleep. Lilly\u2019s head is back against her headrest, and Jax is in much the same position as Ashlyn. The stewardess doesn\u2019t even come through the cabin for drink service; she just stays strapped into her seat. Before I know it, the captain makes an announcement that we will be landing soon. Once I feel the plane touch down, I reach across the small aisle and run my fingers down Lilly\u2019s cheek. Her eyes open and meet mine before looking down at Jax, who is now awake, then over at Ashlyn. We wait until most of the passengers are off the plane before we stand and get our carry-ons out of the bins; it\u2019s easier than trying to fight everyone to get off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We step off the plane, and I have never been happier in my life to have my feet on solid ground. All I want to do is eat, shower, and sleep.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to take her?\u201d Lilly asks, looking at Ashlyn, who is still asleep.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, I got her,\u201d I say, grabbing her hand as we make our way into the terminal.</p><p>\u201cMommy...I mean...Lilly,\u201d Jax says, and I look over at Lilly, who is smiling down at Jax.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, honey?\u201d she says quietly, running her hand down the back of his head. My stomach drops as I watch the woman I love and plan on asking to marry me interact with my son, who has gotten so close to her that he slipped and called her Mom. I wish his mother was normal and sane and had a relationship with him, but she doesn\u2019t. I don\u2019t even think she cares one way or another what happens with Jax. The more time that goes by, I\u2019m convinced that the only reason she is involved in Jax\u2019s life at all is to hold him over my head or f**k with me.</p><p>\u201cCan we go fishing like Grandpa talked about?\u201d Jax asks.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure Grandpa will take you fishing, just not today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he sighs, grabbing Lilly\u2019s other hand. \u201cCan we go look for beers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, honey, but not today.\u201d She laughs softly. I drop her hand so I can shift Ashlyn, and I feel Lilly\u2019s hand go into my back pocket.</p> <p>\u201cCan we go out on the boat and see otters, like Grandpa said?\u201d Jax asks and I chuckle. He and Ashlyn have been having Skype sessions with Lilly\u2019s parents every few days since our first time a few months ago. Every time the kids talked to Lilly\u2019s parents, her dad told Jax about all the cool things that they were going to do when we came to visit.</p><p>\u201cI'm sure we will go out on the boat at some point while we\u2019re here, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we go to McDonald\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no McDonald\u2019s here.\u201d Lilly laughs when Jax\u2019s eyes get huge, and he looks around the airport\u2014if you can even call it that; it\u2019s more like a large metal building with a check-in counter and two doors, one where you enter, and one where you go out onto the tarmac. Every plane that lands has to be boarded from outside.</p><p>\u201cOh, my babies!\u201d is cried loudly and echoes through the metal building. Ashlyn startles in my arms, and Lilly and Jax are plowed into. Both of them are hugged and rocked back and forth.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom,\u201d Lilly says, smiling and untangling herself and Jax from her mom. Once her mom steps back, she looks down at Jax. \u201cThis guy here that you just scared the crap out of is Jax,\u201d she says, putting her hand on Jax\u2019s shoulder, \u201cand this is Cash.\u201d She slides her arm around my waist, looking up at me. And I don\u2019t know what it is about that exact moment, but the look on her face and her introducing us to her mom as a family makes me shift Ashlyn so that I can kiss her. When I take my mouth from hers, her eyes are soft and so full of emotion that my heart beat kicks up a notch.</p> <p>\u201cUuuummm,\u201d I hear Lilly\u2019s mom clear her throat and I smile, my face still near Lil\u2019s. She grins before going back to flat-footed.</p><p>\u201cThey do that a lot,\u201d Jax says, and I pull completely away from Lil and meet her mom\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Mrs. Donovan.\u201d I lean forward slightly, kissing her cheek and giving her a one-handed hug, trying not to wake Ashlyn. She shakes her head and rolls her eyes.</p><p>\u201cCall me Mom. Obviously, you\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d I chuckle and look at Lilly when I hear her laugh. She shakes her head before looking back at Mom.</p><p>\u201cSo where\u2019s Dad?\u201d She looks around, and I do as well. I can\u2019t see her dad anywhere.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, he had to help Austin put his boat in the water,\u201d she says, and Lilly\u2019s posture changes slightly. I don\u2019t know why, but it starts to set off alarm bells. I want to ask who Austin is, but a loud buzz fills the room. I look over to the side to see bags being tossed in through a little hole in the wall.</p><p>\u201cOur bags,\u201d Lilly says making her way to the conveyor belt.</p><p>\u201cHere, baby, take Ashlyn and I\u2019ll get our bags.\u201d I make sure Ashlyn is settled before I go about collecting our bags. Once I\u2019ve gotten them all, we make our way outside to a large SUV and load everything in before getting the kids settled. Ashlyn is still asleep, and Jax\u2019s little head has started to bob to the side.</p> <p>\u201cHow was the flight?\u201d Lilly\u2019s mom asks.</p><p>\u201cGood, both the kids were well behaved, so we didn\u2019t really have any problems,\u201d Lil tells her. We talk on the way to her parents\u2019 house, Lil catching her mom up on the kids and telling her about what she hopes will be her new job at the school in town. She still hasn\u2019t told her parents about leaving the other school or what happened. I have tried to tell her that she should, but the damn woman is stubborn and won\u2019t listen. She only told her parents about living with me a few weeks ago. I wasn\u2019t around for that Skype session, but she said it went okay. My guess is they were not happy. But I honestly couldn\u2019t find it in myself to care. I had both my girls and my son under one roof; that\u2019s all that mattered to me. It takes about thirty minutes to get from the airport, which is in the middle of nowhere, to town. Well, if you can call it a town. We drive through it in about one minute. I swear, if I would have blinked, I would have missed the whole thing. There is a bank, a few stores, and about three bars that I can spot. We turn off the main street, heading down to what I can tell is the water; the closer we get, the more boats and men in fishing gear I see.</p><p>\u201cI want to stop by the pier and see if your dad wants to go out to dinner, or if he wants to cook at home,\u201d Mom says as we continue our drive, until we reach a dead end. Jax\u2019s head comes up, and when we stop, he looks around before yelling, \u201cYay, we\u2019re going fishing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, little dude, we\u2019re going to see Lil\u2019s dad before we go to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He slumps in his seat and I look to my other side when I feel Ashlyn grab my arm.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a good nap, baby?\u201d She nods then looks around, and I can tell exactly when she notices where we are by the smile that lights up her face.</p><p>\u201cMemaw,\u201d Ashlyn says quietly, and I can see Lil\u2019s mom smile at her in the rearview mirror before hopping out of the truck and opening the back door on Ashlyn\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s my girl?\u201d she asks Ashlyn, helping her out of her car seat. Once she\u2019s free, she\u2019s picked up and smothered in kisses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop, Memaw! Stop!\u201d Ashlyn squeals, trying to get free.</p><p>\u201cI need my sugar. I haven\u2019t had any in a long time, so I need to make up for lost time,\u201d Lil\u2019s mom says between kisses. Ashlyn finally squirms out of her arms and runs to stand behind Jax. \u201cI guess your big brother is going to protect you,\u201d Mom says, laughing. \u201cWhat do you say we go find Papa?\u201d she asks, starting to walk towards a large boat with the name Wolf on the side in large black letters. I grab Lilly\u2019s hand, and we follow along behind her. Once we reach the boat that is tied to the dock, she steps onboard then leans over, grabbing Jax first and bringing him over before grabbing Ashlyn and pulling her on. I can see Jax\u2019s face is completely lit up with excitement as he looks around the deck of the boat.</p><p>\u201cPapa!\u201d Ashlyn yells. I follow her with my eyes just as Lilly\u2019s dad bends down to pick her up.</p><p>\u201cHey, angel girl,\u201d he says, hugging her and tucking her head into his chest before pulling her face away and looking her over.</p> <p>\u201cLook! My brother,\u201d Ashlyn says, pointing down at Jax.</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy,\u201d Mr. Donovan says, bending to set Ashlyn down before rubbing the top of Jax\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cAre we gonna go fishin\u2019?\u201d Jax asks, making Lil\u2019s dad laugh.</p><p>\u201cNot today. But before you go back home, we will be going out on the boat to fish for halibut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d Jax breathes, looking around again. Mr. Donovan stands back up, his eyes coming to us before Lilly lets go of my hand and takes off running into her dad\u2019s open arms.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Dad,\u201d I can hear her say before she leans away, placing her hand on his cheek.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s my girl?\u201d he asks her, pulling her back in for another hug.</p><p>\u201cReally good,\u201d she says, and then looks over her shoulder at me. I step forward as he tucks Lil under his arm and sticks out his hand for me to take.</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d I say, giving his hand a shake.</p><p>\u201cNice to have you here, son,\u201d he says, and a little bit of the knot that I didn\u2019t even notice before loosens.</p><p>\u201cNice to be here.\u201d I step back and look over Lil\u2019s dad\u2019s shoulder as a giant guy comes out of nowhere. He is tall, way taller than my 6\u20191. I would guess that he is closer to 6\u20196; his hair is blond and is overgrown, matching his beard. He is huge; his arms look as big as my thighs. His whole body is large, and I\u2019m taken slightly aback. I start to step towards Lilly, wanting her near me while this guy is around, then I hear him speak and want her near me for a different reason.</p> <p>\u201cLilly?\u201d he says, and she turns around. Her face lights up and she runs to the guy, throwing her arms around his neck as his hands slide around her waist, pulling her in for a hug.</p><p>\u201cAustin,\u201d she says low, but I still catch it and it sounds intimate, or maybe it\u2019s my own personal jealousy taking over. \u201cHow have you been?\u201d she asks stepping back, but his hands are still on her hips and it\u2019s taking everything in me not to walk over to him, rip his hands off her, and toss his ass overboard.</p><p>\u201cGood, better now I have seen your face,\u201d he says, and his eyes are soft while looking at her. My jaw clenches. Lilly steps back out of his touch, then turns to look at me.</p><p>\u201cCash, this is Austin. Austin, this is Cash.\u201d I take a few steps in their direction, putting my hand out to meet his.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d I say, but it sounds more like a growl. My hand slides around the back of Lilly\u2019s waist, pulling her tight against me. Jax comes up, grabbing Lilly\u2019s hand, and I wonder if my son senses the same threat I do.</p><p>\u201cCash. Cash?\u201d Austin repeats, his eyes get big before narrowing. \u201cYou\u2019re Cash, as in Ashlyn\u2019s father, Cash?\u201d he asks, his eyes going to Lil before coming back to me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story, Austin,\u201d Lilly says quickly, then pulls his attention back to her. \u201cMaybe while were here, we can meet up for lunch and I can tell you everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr not,\u201d I say low enough for only Lilly to hear.</p> <p>\u201cCash,\u201d she replies, her head swinging my way and her eyes narrowing.</p><p>\u201cAll right, well, we just wanted to stop by and see if you wanted to have dinner at home, or if you wanted to go out to dinner tonight,\u201d Lilly\u2019s mom says loudly, taking the attention away from what\u2019s going on.</p><p>\u201cI think we should eat at home. I can grill up some of those elk steaks that I\u2019ve got in the freezer,\u201d Lil\u2019s dad says, then looking at Austin, \u201cYou wanna come to dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not tonight. I have to finish getting the boat ready to head out tomorrow.\u201d He looks around the boat. \u201cMaybe when I get back we can set something up?\u201d He looks at Lilly, who nods. We all turn around and head off the boat, the kids jumping onto the dock, followed by Lil\u2019s parents, then me. I put my arm around her shoulders, and lean my head to the side so I can speak to her without anyone hearing.</p><p>\u201cAustin?\u201d I ask, and her steps falter slightly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good friend,\u201d she says, and I know I shouldn\u2019t, but I see red.</p><p>\u201cA good friend,\u201d I repeat.</p><p>\u201cYess,\u201d she hisses, \u201che was a good friend. He was there for me when I needed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was he there?\u201d I ask, wanting to take the words back as soon as I say them.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to act like a jealous ass when you were flipping married,\u201d she growls, and her elbow connects with my ribs, then she slides out from under my arm, walking up to where the kids are. I want to kick my own ass. I cannot believe I just did that. I look over my shoulder when I get the feeling someone is watching me. Austin is standing on the deck of his boat, his arms crossed and his legs spread apart. Fucking great. I shake my head. Lilly\u2019s dad looks back at me and I shrug, picking up my pace. By the time I get to the SUV, Lilly has both kids inside and is buckled in herself. She doesn\u2019t look at me when I pass by her to get into the back, and she doesn\u2019t say a word while we drive to her parents\u2019 house. But she doesn\u2019t have to say anything. I can feel the anger coming off her in waves. We drive for about twenty minutes and end up in front of a large, two-story log house with a large wraparound front porch. The kids both unbuckle themselves, and Lilly hops out before helping each of them down. I get out on the other side of the SUV and make my way around the back to get our bags. I watch as Lilly makes her way inside with Jax, Ashlyn, and her mom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know, I wasn\u2019t happy about you two being back together.\u201d I turn my head to look at Lilly\u2019s dad when he speaks. I\u2019m really not in the mood for any bullshit, but out of respect for Lil, I will let her dad say his piece. \u201cBut I trust my daughter, and I know she has always made smart decisions. Plus, your little speech about not caring what I thought about you marrying her may have earned you a few points in my book. It\u2019s hard not to respect a man who knows what he wants.\u201d He pats my back then squeezes down on my shoulder. \u201cBut you need to remember, son, she wasn\u2019t always yours. She had a life, just like you did, and the quicker you can learn to accept that, the better off you will both be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d I take a breath. \u201cI just never thought I would be seeing her life without me up close and personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everything is what it seems.\u201d He smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s like that joke. A hound dog lays in the yard, and an old man in overalls sits on the porch. \u2018Excuse me, sir, but does your dog bite?\u2019 a jogger asks. The old man looks over his newspaper and replies, \u2018Nope.\u2019 As soon as the jogger enters the yard, the dog begins snarling and growling, and then attacks the jogger's legs. As the jogger flails around in the yard, he yells, \u2018I thought you said your dog doesn't bite!\u2019 The old man mutters, \u2018Ain't my dog.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does that even mean?\u201d I question, wondering if Lil\u2019s dad has fallen off the deep end.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes, we see what we want to see, and not what\u2019s really going on,\u201d he says low, his eyes going to the house. \u201cIt\u2019s not my place to talk about Austin\u2019s past, but him and Lilly were both dealing with the loss of people they cared about at the same time and were able to understand what the other was going though. Now trust me when I tell you that if I were to get Austin for a son-in-law, I would be a happy man. But I don\u2019t think that would have ever happened. I just think they each needed a friend during a difficult time, and that\u2019s all it ever was, a friendship. As for you, I knew when my daughter came home from Alabama with my granddaughter that she would never be the same. Not only because she was a single mom, but because she felt like part of her soul had been ripped away from her.</p><p>\u201cI know I f**ked up.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI thought I was doing the right thing at the time. I mean, no, I didn\u2019t know about Lil being pregnant, but I thought I was protecting her at the time. I didn\u2019t want her to have to deal with what I was going through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that. But now think of it this way: Lilly says you have a big family, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has me and her mom.\u201d My gut tightens. I still hate myself for what I had unknowingly put her through. Okay, so I don\u2019t want to kill Austin anymore, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I want them alone together. \u201cYou\u2019re smart,\u201d Mr. Donovan says and smiles, reading the look on my face. \u201cNow, go apologize; it works every time. It\u2019s best you learn that real quick-like.\u201d He pats my back again before reaching in to the SUV, grabbing two of our suitcases, and walking towards the house. I grab the other two bags out of the trunk before slamming the trunk, following behind him.</p> <p>I find the kids and make sure they are okay before going in search of Lilly. I find her upstairs in a bedroom at the end of a hall, her back facing me. She is putting away the stuff from the bags her dad brought in, into a long dresser. \u201cYou need help?\u201d I ask, walking farther into the room. Her body goes ridged, and I can hear her sigh.</p><p>\u201cNo. The kids are down the hall. Do you want to check on them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kids are fine; I just checked on them. I want to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to talk to you,\u201d she says low, her head shaking back and forth in agitation.</p><p>\u201cLil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t \u2018Lil\u2019 me.\u201d Her eyes finally meet mine, and she points at me. \u201cI have accepted your past since the beginning of our relationship. I accepted who you were the first time we were together, and I more than accepted you this time around. What did you think, Cash, that you were the only person I would ever be with?\u201d she asks, and I can hear the anger in her words. Each one cutting through me.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I was saying,\u201d I say, taking another step towards her.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re right. You broke me. I couldn\u2019t be with anyone else. Austin is a great guy\u2014sweet, considerate, loving, and handsome\u2014but I couldn\u2019t be with him, no matter how many times I tried, no matter how much I liked him. He wasn\u2019t you. No one was ever you.\u201d As much as it kills to think of her trying to be with anyone, I understand. I see tears in her eyes, and I\u2019m done with the space separating us. Walking towards her, I quickly pull her to me, not giving her a chance to argue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I breathe her in, the smell of lavender comforting me. \u201cIt was a shit thing to ask you.\u201d I rub her back. \u201cI love you, Lil. I just...shit...I just hate the idea of you with anyone else.\u201d I take a breath; I can still tell that she\u2019s crying. \u201cPlease don\u2019t cry because I\u2019m an idiot,\u201d I say gently.</p><p>\u201cYou are an idiot,\u201d she says. I can feel her cheek move against my chest and I know she\u2019s smiling.</p><p>\u201cAs long as I\u2019m your idiot, I couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d Her head tilts back, her glassy eyes meeting mine.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you make it really hard to be mad at you,\u201d she says, studying my face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to complain about that. It seems to be working in my favor.\u201d She shakes her head before dropping her forehead to my chest.</p><p>\u201cI hope you know that I will be meeting Austin when he comes back in from his fishing trip,\u201d she tells me and I take a breath, not wanting to say the wrong thing, but not wanting her to meet up with a man that she obviously cares about.</p> <p>\u201cCan I come with you when you meet up with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cYou have to trust me, Cash. Austin and I are friends, nothing more.\u201d Her arms wrap around my waist. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that feelings were not there, and Austin was hurt in the past and I want to make sure he\u2019s doing okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d I whisper into her hair before kissing the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cI know, but it\u2019s something I have to do.\u201d She gives me a squeeze, trying to offer me comfort.</p><p>\u201cI trust you,\u201d I say, and it\u2019s the truth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she replies quietly, but I can hear in those two words how much I just gave to her. My hand goes to the back of her neck before traveling to her jaw so I can tilt her head back.</p><p>\u201cI know what\u2019s in front of me, Lil. I know exactly what I have, so when I feel like it\u2019s being threatened, the first thing I want to do is lash out and kill anything that may come in and jeopardize it. I know what we had before, and I know what we have now. And I will always do everything within my power to protect it.</p><p>\u201cAustin isn\u2019t a threat,\u201d she says, her hand coming up and traveling along my jaw.</p><p>\u201cLilly, your kind of sweet is hard to come by, so when you get even just a little taste of it, you want more. I\u2019m saying that as a man who knows what bitter tastes like,\u201d I tell her gently. I don\u2019t know what happened with Austin and his past relationship, but I have a feeling he knows what bitter tastes like too. And he also knows the kind of woman Lilly is, and how hard that is to find.</p> <p>\u201cI think you\u2019re reading too much into this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, but that\u2019s okay as long as you know that you\u2019re mine. I will try to control the urge to throw you over my shoulder and carry you back to my lair,\u201d I tell her, making her laugh. She rubs her face against my chest before lifting her eyes to meet mine.</p><p>\u201cWe should go check on the kids and get them something to eat,\u201d she tells me before taking a step back. I pull her back to me, bend her back and put my mouth on hers. Once I feel her relax, I nibble on her bottom then top lip.</p><p>\u201cNow, we can go get the kids,\u201d I tell her, my mouth still against hers.</p><p>\u201cYou have to let me go.\u201d She\u2019s right, but I don\u2019t want to.</p> <p>\u201cAre we good?\u201d I don\u2019t like fighting with her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I kiss her once more before righting her, turning her towards the door, and smacking her ass. She looks at me over her shoulder, and all I can do is shrug. \u201cYou have a nice ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in my parents\u2019 house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because were in their house doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to stop touching you when I want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad isn\u2019t going to like you smacking my ass,\u201d she says. I smile, pushing her out the door of the bedroom. \u201cCash, seriously, he won\u2019t like it.\u201d I ignore her, leading her down the hall with a hand in the small of her back to where the kids are. \u201cI would hate to see my dad put his old Seal skills to use by making you disappear.\u201d I start laughing. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny,\u201d she says loudly just as we walk around the corner into the rooms that the kids are playing in.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not funny, Daddy?\u201d Ashlyn asks, running up to us.</p><p>\u201cNothing, love bug.\u201d Lilly glares at me when I chuckle. \u201cAre you guys hungry?\u201d Lilly asks the kids.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starbing,\u201d Jax says, his head going back, his arms going straight out at his sides.</p><p>\u201cLittle dude, when are you not hungry?\u201d I ask, and he looks at me. I can tell he is really thinking about what his answer is going to be.</p><p>\u201cWhen I eat,\u201d he replies, making both of us laugh.</p><p>\u201cBaby, seriously, are you sure you don\u2019t want me to take you?\u201d I ask. I know I promised I would trust her with the whole Austin thing, but what the f**k? The idea of my woman going to meet another man for coffee seems ridiculous to me.</p><p>\u201cCash, we talked about this. I will only be gone for about an hour, if that, then I will be home,\u201d she repeats the same thing she told me five minutes ago.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I grumble. I\u2019m sure I sound like Jax.</p> <p>\u201cAn hour,\u201d she repeats, kissing me. She grabs her bag and a set of keys off the counter and heads out the door. I watch her go, wanting to drag her back inside, but I know she will kick my ass if I try. I look around the quiet house; Jax and Ashlyn are out with Lilly\u2019s dad. Her mom is sleeping, so it just me and my imagination. I need to keep busy.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d I spin around, coming face-to-face with Lilly\u2019s mom, who is looking at me like I\u2019m crazy, and maybe I am. I got bored, so I started cleaning. I had just finished vacuuming the whole downstairs when she showed up.</p><p>\u201cVacuuming,\u201d I tell her, lifting the vacuum up.</p><p>\u201cI know. I was trying to take a nap when I heard you down here. What the hell is wrong with you?\u201d Her hands go to her waist and she looks a little scary. \u201cAustin is just a friend to Lilly, so you need to relax, and if you don\u2019t want to relax and cleaning helps you decompress, or de-stress, or whatever the hell it is you\u2019re doing, then take the vacuum upstairs and finish what you started,\u201d she says, walking past me into the kitchen. I\u2019m just finishing my vacuuming when Lilly comes into the room. She looks just the same as she did before\u2014no happier, no sadder\u2014so I guess that\u2019s good.</p><p>\u201cYou vacuumed?\u201d she asks, looking around, then at the vacuum in my hand.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say defensively. \u201cI know the kids are messy; I just wanted to help out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooo-kay.\u201d She rolls her eyes. \u201cI brought you a coffee and a cinnamon roll; they are both downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Ha! She thought of me when she was out with Austin. She starts to walk away, but I snag her, bending her backwards and kissing her, possessing her mouth. When I right her, she looks at me and smiles before skipping away. The damn woman is going to make me lose my mind.</p><p>I\u2019m dying. I take a deep breath; my lungs are on fire, along with the muscles in my legs. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m dead already. I look ahead and see that Austin and Lil\u2019s dad are about a quarter of a mile ahead of me. We\u2019re hiking up the side of the mountain they said was great for hunting bears. Honestly, I don\u2019t even want to see a bear in the wild, let alone get close enough to shoot it. \u201cHurry up there, son,\u201d Lil\u2019s dad calls back over his shoulder. I shake my head in disgust; I thought I was in good shape.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d I grumble, and glare when I see Austin look over his shoulder with a smirk on his face. He isn\u2019t even sweating, which is strange considering he has as much hair on his body as a wild animal. After about twenty minutes, we get to the top of the mountain. The view is breathtaking. \u201cThis is amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is where I asked Lilly\u2019s mom to marry me,\u201d Frank says, his eyes landing on me, his arms crossing over his chest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good spot,\u201d I tell him, looking out over the valley below. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen are you going to ask my daughter to marry you?\u201d I look at him, then over at Austin. My hand goes to my pocket where I have kept her ring since picking it up at the jewelers. I run my fingers over the metal before pulling it out of my pocket.</p><p>\u201cI actually wanted to ask you for permission.\u201d I hold the ring out in his direction. The ring has three diamonds. They represent our past, present, and future. They\u2019re wrapped in white gold, with the kids\u2019 birthstones set in-between.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe she took you back,\u201d Austin says, looking at the ring, then me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it either, but she\u2019s mine, and I will take out anyone who stands in the way of us having a future.\u201d I look directly at Austin; his eyes flare, but he doesn\u2019t say anything.</p> <p>\u201cYou have my blessing,\u201d Frank says. I look at him to see him smiling.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I reply, putting the ring back in my pocket.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the box?\u201d Austin asks.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ring box, where is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the garbage.\u201d I sigh. \u201cI can\u2019t have the box in my pocket; it\u2019s too obvious,\u201d I say, running my fingers over the ring again. This is a new habit; touching it does something to calm me.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you had it?</p><p>\u201cA little over a month,\u201d I say, shrugging. I like having it with me. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll ask; I just have a feeling that when the time comes, I will know.</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t burning a hole in your pocket?\u201d Austin asks, looking at me curiously.</p><p>\u201cHonestly,\u201d I shake my head, \u201cyeah, but I want to make sure that she is ready before I ask her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a spot she loves,\u201d Austin says, looking thoughtful. I\u2019m not sure I would want to ask her to marry me at any location they used to go to together. He must read my face when the next words come out of his mouth. \u201cChilds Glacier. She loves it out there. And no, we never went there together,\u201d Austin says, and I remember her telling me about that place, saying there wasn\u2019t anywhere in the world more beautiful. I can even remember the pictures she had in her apartment when I first started dating her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure when I\u2019m going to ask her. I want it to be in the moment.\u201d I look at Austin and Frank, who both smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you want her to say yes, then you should be in the moment at Childs Glacier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will say yes,\u201d I say, not feeling so confident when I read the looks on their faces. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen she was a little girl, she told me she wanted her future husband to ask her to marry her at her favorite spot, just like I asked her mom to marry me at her favorite place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just keep thinking I will know when I\u2019m supposed to ask her.\u201d I sigh, pulling the hat off my head.</p><p>\u201cBud, just take her out to the glacier. If you don\u2019t get the feeling when you\u2019re there, then don\u2019t ask her,\u201d Austin says. I really don\u2019t want to like this guy, but he makes it hard not to.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d I say, thinking over the idea.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Frank smiles and pats my back. \u201cEnough of the women-talk, time to go find our bear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShit,\u201d I groan. \u201cHow the hell did I end up in this situation?\u201d I look at Austin, who laughs.</p><p>\u201cYou need to man-up,\u201d Austin says, smiling. \u201cWe need to make a man out of you. Hunting is like coffee; it puts hair on your chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I think you need to quit drinking coffee and hunting.\u201d I look him over, shaking my head. He looks like a bear.</p><p>\u201cJealous?\u201d he asks, pulling down the top of his shirt and showing off his chest hair.</p><p>\u201cFuck no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicks love it.\u201d He smiles, and I can\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you two gossiping about? Get it together; we\u2019re burning daylight,\u201d Frank yells. Austin looks at me and shrugs before taking off hiking again.</p><p>\u201cYou better be careful, Austin, you could easily be confused with a bear,\u201d I tell his back. His hand raises over his shoulder so he can flip me off. I start to jog so I\u2019m not so far behind and pray we don\u2019t see a bear.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Lilly</p><p>I look out the window of the truck into the side-view mirror. The dirt road we\u2019re driving on is creating a large dust cloud behind us. All along the side of the road is empty space with large mountains off in the distance. My mom and dad are keeping the kids for us for a few hours so that Cash and I can go out to Childs Glacier. There are two glaciers near where I grew up in Alaska: one is Childs, the other, Miles. Childs Glacier has been one of my favorite places to go and think since I was young. There is just something about looking at a natural wonder that has been around for thousands of years. Along with the beauty of it\u2014the amazing glaring white and turquoise color that is woven throughout the ice, and the river running along the front of it\u2014if you\u2019re lucky, you can watch a piece of ice fall off into the water; the sound of thunder that fills the air when it happens is awe inspiring.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in that head of yours?\u201d Cash asks, pulling my hand up to his mouth to kiss my fingers.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I smile, looking over at him.</p><p>\u201cAre you sad that were leaving in a couple of days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and no.\u201d I squeeze his hand. \u201cI miss my parents, but I also miss home,\u201d I tell him and see him smile.</p><p>\u201cI miss home too, but I am gonna miss it here.\u201d He puts my hand on his thigh with his on top of mine, his thumb running across the top. \u201cThis is someplace I could see myself living,\u201d he says, and I laugh; he is only saying that because he has never gone through an Alaskan winter. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, in the winter, there are times it snows so badly that you can\u2019t even open the front door. A couple of years ago, the National Guard had to come in and dig people out because there were fifteen feet of snow in some areas.\u201d I watch as his eyes almost bug out of his head. \u201cSo, now do you want to move here?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cI think we will just have to find time to visit in the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d Cash asks. My eyes go from him to the road, and I see a giant black blur in the middle of the road ahead of us.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I mumble, squinting my eyes. The closer we get, the clearer the object in the middle of the road becomes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs it an elk?\u201d Cash asks, and I shake my head no. I haven\u2019t seen a wild moose up close for years, and this one is huge; the antlers alone look as big as the truck we\u2019re traveling in.</p><p>\u201cSlow down,\u201d I say, trying to breathe.</p><p>\u2018What?\u201d Cash asks, and I can see the moose take notice of us. I know we\u2019re screwed unless we can get the truck turned around.</p><p>\u201cSlow down!\u201d I repeat, this time shouting the words. Cash slams the brakes, making the truck skid on the gravel road. The moose, who had been standing in the middle of the road, has now started running towards us. In Alaska, wild moose can be very aggressive, especially the males. \u201cTurn the truck around!\u201d I yell as I watch the moose running at us.</p> <p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn the truck around now!\u201d I scream, seeing the moose running at full speed. Cash looks at me, then slams the truck in reverse. The truck backs off the road, the tail end hanging off the road, down into the ditch. I look out the side window, seeing that the moose is still coming towards us. He is now a lot closer, his head down, and his large antlers swinging back and forth. \u201cGo, go, go!\u201d I cry, listening to the tires as they try to catch the road, but by the sound, I can tell that all they\u2019re hitting is air.</p><p>\u201cBaby, when I say, I need you to throw yourself back against the seat,\u201d Cash says calmly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do it...on three,\u201d he says, his eyes on me. I nod, then he starts to count. The second he gets to three, I push myself backwards hard against the seat and feel the truck tip back. The tires hit the gravel, and the truck lunges forward. The only problem is now we\u2019re heading right for the moose. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d I scream, my hands going to my face to cover it.</p> <p>\u201cShit!\u201d Cash yells. I feel the car jerk to the right, making me slide across my seat, we jerk to the left. And I wait to feel the impact from the moose running into us, but nothing comes. \u201cWe\u2019re good, babe,\u201d Cash says, and I remove my hands from my face. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Cash asks, and I nod as his hand goes to the back of my neck where his fingers move in slow circles. A few minutes later, he pulls the car over, unbuckles my seatbelt, and then pulls me over into his lap. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d His hands and eyes run over my body.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m good.\u201d I wrap my arms around his shoulders, burying my face in his neck.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not moving to Alaska.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d I say, breathing him in.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was afraid of seeing a bear; now I know I should have been afraid to see a damn moose.\u201d He chuckles, and I feel the rumble against my cheek. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the near death experience or what, but I want...no, I need him. I feel my clit pulse and my mouth opens up on his neck. My tongue comes out, traveling up his neck to his ear, and I feel him grow hard under me. \u201cBaby, what are you doing?\u201d His voice is rough and goes right to my core, where I feel myself become wetter. His hand at my waist travels up my side so that his thumb is resting under my breast.</p><p>\u201cPlease, touch me.\u201d I move my mouth to his, where I bite his bottom lip, giving it a hard tug. \u201cPlease, touch me,\u201d I beg as I watch his eyes flash. Then his hand is in my hair at the back of my head.</p> <p>\u201cYou want me to touch you?\u201d he asks, pulling my face away from his. I nod and he tugs my hair again.</p><p>\u201cGive me the words, Lil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I want you to touch me,\u201d I say barely above a whisper.</p><p>\u201cMy girl misses my touch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I agree. Since we have been in Alaska, we haven\u2019t had sex. Being in my parents\u2019 house isn\u2019t really conducive. Their walls are like paper, and the kids have ended up in bed with us every night since we got here.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want, baby.\u201d He pulls my head forward, and I can feel the slight sting of his fist in my hair.</p><p>\u201cAnything,\u201d I say; I just need to feel his hands on me.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d he asks, looking me over. His hand goes under the seat, and we slide back suddenly. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that you just said anything.\u201d His hands go to my waist, where he turns me so that I\u2019m straddling him. \u201cWait, take off your pants,\u201d he says, helping me move so I can get my shoes and pants off. Once I get them off, he pulls me back over on top of him. I\u2019m so turned on that the feel of the denim of his jeans rubbing against my inner thighs has me moaning out loud. \u201cPut your hands on the steering wheel behind you.\u201d My hands go behind me automatically, grabbing onto the steering wheel. This position causes my br**sts to thrust out and my back to arch. I watch as Cash\u2019s hand comes up and wraps around my neck before traveling down, and I hear the distinct sound of the zipper of my hoodie being pulled down. Once he has it open, his hands come up, palming my br**sts through the thin tank top I\u2019m wearing. My eyes close and I feel him tug the tank top and my bra down until my br**sts are free. \u201cYou have beautiful tits,\u201d he says, pulling on each nipple. \u201cBut you know I love your ass,\u201d he says, his hands going to my behind, squeezing and pulling me hard against him. I cry out against the friction. \u201cYou\u2019re really wet, baby.\u201d I can hear the hunger in his voice; my eyes open and he is looking down between my thighs. His fingers run over the center of the thin material covering me. My body jerks, and his eyes come up to meet mine. Then I feel his finger move the material aside, the tip of his finger sliding over my clit. \u201cJesus, baby, what the f**k?\u201d he growls before I\u2019m flying through the air. I land on my back in the seat. I don\u2019t even have time to react before my legs are thrust open, my panties ripped to the side, and Cash\u2019s mouth is devouring me.</p> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d I cry, my hands going to his hair, holding him to me. My leg that is on the floorboard of the truck comes up to wrap around his shoulder. \u201cOh, God, don\u2019t stop.\u201d My head thrashes back and forth against the seat, and the minute I feel two fingers fill me, I come hard and fast. The force of it takes my breath away, and my hands in his hair fist and pull, trying to get him away from me. My eyes open when he stops; his eyes are on me as he wipes his mouth on the inside of my thigh. He sits up on his knees, still between my open legs, his hands go to the button of his jeans, and he unbuttons and unzips them quickly. His hard c**k springs free when he pulls down his boxers, and his hands go back to my thighs, then under. He pulls me up, then leans his big body over me, filling me full in one long stroke. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo f**king tight.\u201d His words are said against my mouth. I can taste myself on him, his hands at my ass pulling me up to meet each stroke. My hands go up the back of his shirt, my nails digging into his skin. My foot goes to the steering wheel, getting leverage. \u201cFuck me, baby,\u201d he rumbles, his body arching so he can bend his head to pull my nipple into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I hiss, my head going back to push my breast deeper into his mouth. His pace picks up, his hips slamming into me so hard that my head starts to bang against the door until he puts his hand at the top of my head to cushion it.</p><p>\u201cI love this pu**y,\u201d he groans, and I know he\u2019s close when I feel him get even bigger inside me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close,\u201d I tell him, my mouth going to his shoulder and my legs tightening around him. His free hand comes between us, zeroing in on my clit. I thrust up against him and break apart, biting down hard. I feel myself convulse, and I know that my orgasm has caused his to set off. His hips jerk a few more times before his strokes slow and then stop. His forehead comes to rest on my shoulder. He is breathing heavily, the skin of his back wet with sweat.</p> <p>\u201cI missed being inside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you too,\u201d I breathe, my limbs squeezing him more tightly against me. His forehead comes off my shoulder. His eyes meet mine and he smiles.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d His hand rubs the top of my head; it feels tender from being banged into the door of the truck.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I smile then start to laugh, shoving my face into his throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d He chuckles, kissing the top of my head.</p> <p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I smile, feeling happy.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to take me to the glacier now that you\u2019ve had your way with me?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think we should stay here for the rest of the day,\u201d I tell him, pulling my face out of his neck and my hand out from under his shirt so that I can run my fingers down his jaw.</p><p>\u201cThis is a good place to be.\u201d He smirks, rotating his hips and making me bite the inside of my cheek. \u201cBut we only have two more days in Alaska, and I really want to see this place that you have been telling me about since I met you.\u201d He gently touches his mouth to mine, and his hips pull away so he can slide out of me. He bends forward, kissing my belly, then helps me sit up. I watch, fascinated as his hips lift off the seat and he tucks himself back into his jeans. \u201cBabe, seriously, get dressed.\u201d I nod and look away, picking my jeans up off the truck floor. I pull them on, then my socks and boots. Once I have straightened out my clothes and hair, I put my seatbelt back on and he puts the truck in drive. It takes twenty minutes to get out to the glacier. Once we reach the Million-Dollar Bridge, better known as \u2018The Bridge to Nowhere\u2019, I know we\u2019re close. \u201cSo you\u2019re telling me that that bridge goes to absolutely nowhere, and that the state of Alaska paid a million dollars to have it built just so they could get rid of the money so it wouldn\u2019t go back to the government?\u201d</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s what I\u2019m telling you.\u201d I smile. \u201cWell, that\u2019s what I have always been told about the bridge, anyway.\u201d I shrug. We pull off the road and get out of the truck so we can walk across the bridge. It is in much better shape than it used to be in. About fifteen years ago, you would have to walk or drive across wooden planks; now that it\u2019s refinished, you don\u2019t have to worry about plummeting to your death. We stand in the middle of the bridge. Cash\u2019s arms wrap around me from behind, and we look down at the water below and at the glacier off in the distance. I feel him kiss the back of my head. I always wanted to share this place with someone. It really is beautiful. I snuggle into his embrace, just enjoying the feeling of having him here with me. I miss the simple life of Alaska; everything is so different here. In the winter, you know every person in town since there are no tourists. And if something ever happens to one of the residents, everyone comes together to offer any support needed. I guess the town where I now live in Tennessee is similar. You just have to multiply the number of residents by a few thousand.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to show me the glacier?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I smile, looking over my shoulder. He leans in and places a kiss on my forehead before taking my hand and leading me back to the truck. Once we\u2019re both buckled in, he drives the next few minutes to the bridge leading to the perfect spot to see the giant body of dense ice. We both get out and meet at the front of the truck. Cash takes my hand again, and I pull him down the long dirt path to the glacier and the viewing area. You can\u2019t see anything until you climb to the top, then you see nothing but a beach area, a giant river, and Childs Glacier sitting on the other side.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Cash says, making me smile. I know it\u2019s one thing to talk about seeing a glacier, but it\u2019s another thing completely to see it for yourself. The air near the glacier is so much colder, but it is also so much cleaner.</p><p>\u201cI told you it was awesome.\u201d I tug on his hand, dragging him behind me to the edge of the river. \u201cYou would think just by looking at it that it\u2019s close, but it\u2019s actually miles away,\u201d I tell him, looking across the river at the giant white wall of the glacier in front of us. The colors of turquoise and blue that run through it are so vibrant that the whole thing looks like a painting.</p><p>\u201cIt really is the perfect place,\u201d he says, standing behind me. One of his arms wraps around my waist, the other around my chest, his chin resting on the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cI love coming out here.\u201d I put my hands on his arm at my chest. \u201cThis is the one place where you really are apart from all the stresses of normal life. I know, standing here, just how small I am in the giant scheme of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may be small in terms of the whole world, but to me and my kids, you make up our world,\u201d he says softly against my ear. My tummy flips over, and I can\u2019t help the tears I feel filling my eyes. I feel his hand leave my waist, and he reaches into his pocket. I think he is going to pull out his cell phone so he can take a picture, so when his hand comes around in front of me, it takes a second to realize what he is holding.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I breathe, my nails digging into his arm. In between his fingers is the most beautiful ring I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>\u201cI have been carrying this thing around for a while now, waiting for the right time to ask you to marry me.\u201d My brain slowly registers the words. It starts screaming \u2018yes, yes, yes!\u2019 but I can\u2019t make anything come out except, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My eyes are glued to the ring; it\u2019s absolutely perfect. I feel myself being turned, but my eyes are locked on the design of the ring\u2014three diamonds, and two smaller stones in-between. I don\u2019t really notice the change in position until Cash is kneeling in front of me.</p><p>\u201cLil, I need you to look at me.\u201d I shake my head before taking my eyes off the ring and meeting his. \u201cI kept telling myself that when the time was right, I would know it, and this is the moment.\u201d I watch him take a breath, his hand grabbing mine. \u201cThis is the moment I have been waiting for. This is the moment we start our forever. This is the moment you tell me you will marry me and make me the luckiest f**king man on this planet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I cover my mouth and drop to my knees in front of him, burying my face in his chest. I start to cry immediately. If someone would have told me a year ago that I would be with Cash at my favorite place in the world, with him on his knee asking me to marry him, I would have laughed in their face. I never would have believed that this was a possibility for me.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you\u2019re freaking me the f**k out right now.\u201d His arms are wrapped tightly around me, his mouth close to my ear.</p> <p>\u201cI...I\u2019m...s-so...h-happy,\u201d I say on a sob, and laugh because I sound like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cI would feel like you are telling me the truth if my shirt wasn\u2019t soaked with your tears, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I take a deep breath and pull my face back so I can look at him. His hands go to the hair at the side of my head, pulling it away from my face.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say we see how the ring fits?\u201d His eyes search my face and I smile, looking at his hand. He leans forward and places a light kiss on my lips before taking his right hand away from my face, pulling the ring off his finger, and pulling my hand towards him. I feel the cool metal slide along my finger and over my knuckle. The fit is just right.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d I put my hand against his chest, looking at the ring there.</p> <p>\u201cI had it made to represent our family, and all of us coming together as one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I say, looking up from the ring on my hand and into his handsome face.</p><p>\u201cYou are my world, baby. I never thought I would be this happy again. Now, having you back, and having Ashlyn and Jax, I have surpassed happiness.\u201d He smiles, showing off both dimples.</p><p>\u201cI feel the same. I didn\u2019t think I would ever feel like this again.\u201d I wrap my arms around his waist, laying my head against his chest. We\u2019re turned to the side so that we can both look out at the glacier. \u201cThank you for giving this to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t anything I wouldn\u2019t do for you.\u201d His arms give me a squeeze. \u201cThere is no way for you to know what you have given me,\u201d he says softly, kissing the top of my head. I don\u2019t say anything, just hold him a little tighter. I know what I have given him, because he has given me the same thing.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting married,\u201d I blurt after a few minutes. I feel Cash shaking with laughter. I know it\u2019s dumb, but the realization that he just proposed to me and what that means hits me hard.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, baby, that\u2019s usually what happens when someone asks someone else to marry them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d I roll my eyes, even though he can\u2019t see me do it. We stand there watching as a large piece of ice falls off the glacier, crashing into the water below, the sound echoing around us sounding like thunder.</p><p>\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d he asks, looking around. The whole area is completely empty.</p><p>\u201cThere are guided trips out here a couple times a week, but for the most part, the only people who come out here are residents.\u201d I shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s a long drive, and not too many people want to make the trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see why you like it out here.\u201d His hand reaches around his back, grabbing mine and bringing it between us. \u201cI like this.\u201d He smiles.</p><p>\u201cI love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I like knowing that people will see this and know that you\u2019re taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d I laugh. \u201cWill you wear a ring?\u201d I ask. I know a lot of men don\u2019t; my dad doesn\u2019t, and he is more in love with my mom than the day they met.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says in a way that I know he really likes the idea.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what the kids will say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be happy. I thought about involving them in asking you, but I knew that the minute I told them, they wouldn\u2019t be able to keep the secret.</p><p>\u201cThis has been the best day ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven with the moose attack?\u201d I laugh, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was scary, but what happened afterwards made it well worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d He smiles and kisses my forehead. \u201cWhat do you say we go back to your parents and share the good news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I agree, and we walk back to the truck. The whole way home, we talk about our future, and when we get to my parents\u2019 house, we are greeted with two very excited kids, and my parents are beyond happy for us. It really is the best day ever. I am sad to be going back to Tennessee, but also excited to be starting a new chapter with Cash when we get there.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sign,\u201d Cash says, and I almost laugh, but I can tell he is being completely serious.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a sign; it\u2019s bad weather and a lack of available hotels,\u201d I reply, looking out the window of our hotel room in Las Vegas. We were supposed to have a short layover in Vegas, but the weather changed, and tornados have been touching down all over the south. So they canceled all flights, leaving us to spend the day and night in Vegas.</p><p>\u201cNo, that is a sign,\u201d he says, pointing down at The Little Chapel of Love that is across the street from where were we\u2019re staying for the night.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not getting married here.\u201d I laugh.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, we are. It\u2019s meant to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just asked me to marry you the day before yesterday. I haven\u2019t even gotten used to the idea that I\u2019m your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, then it won\u2019t be difficult for you to get used to the idea of being my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m a genius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLil, I love you. You love me. Our kids are here. It\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even have anything to wear,\u201d I tell him. I have no idea why I\u2019m even considering this; I must be just as crazy as he is. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou and Ashlyn go dress shopping while Jax and I go get our tuxes, and we will meet you across the street at five,\u201d he says, and the hive of honeybees that is always in my stomach when he\u2019s around starts to move even more rapidly.</p><p>\u201cThis is crazy,\u201d I whisper, looking at the small white chapel.</p><p>\u201cThis is perfect.\u201d His arms around my waist give me a squeeze. \u201cWhat does it matter if we do it now or in a few months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...my parents. Your parents,\u201d I remind him.</p><p>\u201cThey will be fine, and we can plan a party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really serious about this aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne-hundred percent serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well then, let\u2019s do this.\u201d I smile, my belly flipping over.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was going to have to try harder to convince you.\u201d I feel his body relax behind me, but his arms squeeze me a little more tightly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be the one to break the news to my parents,\u201d I tell him, not looking forward to that conversation.</p><p>\u201cWorks for me. Your dad loves me; he\u2019ll be cool,\u201d he says, sounding so sure that I can\u2019t help but to laugh.</p><p>\u201cHow did you win him over?\u201d I ask. My dad really does love Cash. I know that if my dad had his way, we would be moving to Alaska, and Cash would be working with my dad on his boat and guiding people when they weren\u2019t out fishing. I was even surprised that Austin gave Cash his seal of approval. They had gotten close after Dad had taken Cash and Austin out on a hunting trip. I guess they all bonded while killing poor defenseless creatures.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have to win him over.\u201d He runs his nose along my ear before kissing me underneath it. \u201cI love his daughter; that\u2019s all he needed,\u201d he says, his warm breath causing goose bumps to break out over my skin.</p><p>\u201cThat may have helped, but you did win him over,\u201d I tell him softly. I don\u2019t know how someone who is so strong can have doubt himself so often. \u201cYou\u2019re a good man and an amazing father. A great friend, a goo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I turn my head to look at him.</p><p>\u201cStop talking, Lil,\u201d he says, and I can see so many emotions on his face that it makes it hard to breath.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all true, Cash,\u201d I say lightly. His mouth goes into a flat line, and his eyes close.</p><p>\u201cIt is, and all of those are the reasons why I\u2019m going to take Ashlyn, go and pick out dresses for us, meet you across the street in a few hours, and tie myself to you in a way that makes it hard for you to get rid of me.\u201d I run my fingers down his cheek.</p><p>\u201cI want that.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cNo, I need that.\u201d His eyes open, and all I can see is love. I can see so much love that I can feel it all the way to my soul. \u201cI need you tied to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, I need and want the same thing,\u201d I tell him. We stand for a few more minutes, his arms around me while we look out the window at the little chapel across the street.</p><p>\u201cAll right, babe, go get Ashlyn and go find a dress. Meet me across the street so I can make you mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I smile and go get Ashlyn, who is sitting in the small sitting room watching cartoons. \u201cHey, love bug, I need your help,\u201d I tell her, then explain exactly what we\u2019re going to do, and all the while her smile gets bigger and bigger. My daughter is a girly-girl, and anything that involves dressing up and looking pretty she is always down for. The boys come in and tell us goodbye, and we leave shortly after them to head out in search of a dress boutique. I find a small shop in a huge casino and happen across the perfect ivory strapless gown. It hugs all my curves and fits me perfectly, and for Ashlyn, I let her pick out a very poufy pink dress and matching shoes. We head to a salon next, spending over an hour getting our hair done, along with manicures and pedicures before heading to the chapel. When we arrive, I don\u2019t know what to expect, but I never would have thought the place would be so beautiful inside. There are no crazy impersonators, or gaudy decorations; it was just a simple room with a large alter, and six pews along the sides with beautiful cream and white flowers running between them.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so pretty,\u201d Ashlyn says. Her eyes are lit up, and then she sees her dad at the same exact moment as I do. She takes off in a run while I\u2019m stuck in place. He looks so hot in his tux that it\u2019s going to take everything in me not to jump him. His eyes leave my face and travel down my body, then back up again. By the time his eyes meet mine, they are so dark and so hungry that I squeeze my thighs together, trying to release some of the ache which has settled there. \u201cDaddy, me and Mommy had the best time eber! Look, I got a new dress,\u201d Ashlyn says excitedly, twirling around. His eyes leave me and he smiles, looking down at our daughter.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a princess,\u201d he tells her.</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d she squeals, jumping up and down. I look to Cash\u2019s side to see Jax standing there, looking very handsome in his tux that matches his dad\u2019s. His hand is at his throat, trying to loosen his tie. His eyes are on his sister when he rolls them in annoyance. I smile because as much as she gets on his nerves, he really does love her. I take a step forward and squat in front of Jax. I want to make sure he is okay with us going through with this.</p><p>\u201cYou want my help?\u201d I ask, moving my hands to his tie, where I loosen it up and undo his top button. \u201cAre you okay with me and your dad getting married?\u201d I ask him quietly. I know he and Ashlyn were both excited when we told them that we were engaged, but this is something different, and I need to know that he is okay with it.</p><p>\u201cWill you be my mom?\u201d he asks, and my eyes fly up to meet his. I take a breath; I don\u2019t even know how to answer that.</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshlyn is my sister already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is,\u201d I agree.</p><p>\u201cSo if you marry my dad, that will make you my mom, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...I will be your stepmom,\u201d I tell him gently. I don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m trying to take his mom\u2019s place. He seems to consider this for a few seconds before replying, \u201cSo, can I call you Mom?\u201d</p><p>Jeez, what the hell do I say to that? I would love for him to call me Mom, but I\u2019m not sure how everyone else will feel about it. I watch his shoulders slump, and I make up my mind right then and there, screw everyone. Okay, not everyone, but I love this kid.</p><p>\u201cI would be honored if you called me Mom, but I think it\u2019s something you should talk to your dad about.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDad, can I call Lilly, Mom?\u201d Jax yells, making Cash swing his head towards us. Oh no, he doesn\u2019t look happy. Crap, crap, crap. I go to stand when Cash squats beside me.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want, little dude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she\u2019s not my real mom,\u201d he says, looking at Cash, then me, \u201cbut can\u2019t I have two moms?\u201d His little head drops, and I want to hold him so badly that I feel my skin prickle.</p><p>\u201cOf course you can,\u201d I tell him, not caring for one second if it\u2019s the right thing or not. I love Jax as much as I love Ashlyn, and think of him as my son, so I\u2019m happy he feels the same about me. Today really is the perfect day; not only am I marrying the man I love, but I\u2019m also gaining a son.</p> <p>Chapter 12</p><p>Cash</p><p>I look down at my little man, my chest feeling tight. I knew he loved Lilly, but after today, I know how deeply that love runs. The lady who runs the chapel has Lilly standing at the end of the aisle. The music begins, and Ashlyn starts down the aisle, dropping flower petals as she goes. My baby girl looks beautiful in her princess dress. When she makes it to me, her head turns to look over her shoulder, looking back at what she\u2019s done. When her eyes came back to me, her head tilts back in pride, and a smile lights up her face, letting me know she is happy with the results. \u201cStand where they told you, baby.\u201d I pointed to the spot. Once she is standing there, Lilly starts making her way towards me. The cut of her dress shows off her br**sts, waist, and hips; I can\u2019t wait to get it off her. Lucky for me, a good friend of mine lives in Vegas with his wife and kids. He agreed to watch the kids for the night. Lilly doesn\u2019t know about my plan yet, but there is no way that I\u2019m not going to spend our wedding night without being inside her. The music continues to play as Lilly comes down the aisle. Her hands are in front of her, holding a bouquet of pink flowers that match Ashlyn\u2019s dress. Once she makes it to me, she smiles, then laughs. \u201cThis is serious business, baby. Why are you laughing?\u201d I reach out, grabbing her hand and dragging her to me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I was just thinking this is nothing like what I pictured when I thought of a Vegas wedding.\u201d I chuckle and pull her even closer so I can whisper to her.</p><p>\u201cShould we leave here and find Elvis so he can marry us?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, this is perfect,\u201d she whispers back, her eyes soft as they search mine, the smile on her face telling me everything that I need to know. I thought that I may have been rushing her, and a part of me felt guilty about it, while the other part couldn\u2019t care less, so it\u2019s a relief to see her excitement and happiness.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to do this?\u201d I ask quietly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I lean forward to kiss her, but she leans back, away from me. \u201cYou can\u2019t kiss me yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until after we\u2019re married.\u201d She shakes her head.</p> <p>\u201cWell then, let\u2019s do this so I can kiss you.\u201d She steps back until she is standing next to Ashlyn, who grabs her hand. The man who is going to marry us takes it as his cue to begin the ceremony. I listened as he speaks, and repeat when necessary, but for the most part, I\u2019m in awe looking at Lilly, wondering how the f**k I got so lucky. I had f**ked up huge in the past with her, and now having her standing across from me, agreeing to be my wife, is something I would never have even considered as a possibility.</p><p>\u201cCash, would you please repeat after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my own vows,\u201d I tell him. Lilly\u2019s eyes widen, then she giggles and shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d the officiator says.</p><p>I clear my throat, feeling nervous all of the sudden. \u201cI vow to love you unconditionally, without hesitation. I will encourage you, trust you, and respect you. As a family, we will create a home filled with learning, laughter, and compassion. I promise to be your biggest fan, your partner in crime, and the person you can always depend on. From the moment we met, you have owned me, and I will love you until I take my last breath. I will work every day to make now into always. With these words, and all the love in my heart, I marry you and bind your life to mine.\u201d I slide an infinity diamond ring up against her wedding ring, bring it to my mouth, and place a kiss on it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really good at this,\u201d she whispers. I can\u2019t help but laugh and kiss her forehead.</p><p>\u201cLilly, do you have vows?\u201d the officiator asks.</p><p>\u201cUm, no, but can I just make it up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you would like.\u201d He smiles.</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d she says, taking hold of my hands. \u201cToday, standing here with our children watching, I choose you, Cash, to be my partner. I am proud to be your wife, and to join my life with yours. I promise to support you, push you, inspire you, and above all, love you, for better or worse, in sickness and health, for richer or poorer, as long as we both shall live.\u201d She is crying harder now, and I can feel tears fill my eyes as she speaks. She shocks me when she pulls her hand away, reaching down the front of her dress where she pulls out a ring. We both start laughing when she mouths the word \u2018storage\u2019 to me. Her hand comes back to mine, lifts them, and slides the ring on my finger, her finger running over it before looking back up at me. Then she reaches her hands forward, one going to either side of my face, pulling my head towards hers.</p><p>\u201cHey, no kissing until we\u2019re married,\u201d I tell her, laughing. I look over at the man and he grins, nodding his head.</p><p>\u201cBy the power invested in me and the great state of Nevada, I now pronounce you Husband and wife. You may now kiss the bride,\u201d he says. My hand goes into the back of Lilly\u2019s hair; I tilt her face back, and my mouth covers hers, my tongue sweeping in. The sound she makes urges me on. I can\u2019t wait to be inside her. There is nothing better than her thighs wrapped around my hips, her arms around my neck, and her wet heat strangling my cock. I reluctantly pull away from her, kissing her lips one more time. Both kids start yelling and running around in circles.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re married,\u201d she says with a smile.</p><p>\u201cWe are,\u201d I agree. After our short ceremony, we have a few pictures taken of us and the kids. We\u2019re almost done when Jax yells, \u201cFlex!\u201d at the top of his lungs and takes off running. \u201cYo, my man!\u201d I yell when I see my buddy Flex walking in holding his wife\u2019s hand, their kids walking near them until they see Jax, then they take off, ready to play.</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d Lilly asks. I\u2019m not surprised that she looks nervous. Flex is a scary looking dude. He\u2019s not very tall at 5\u20198 but he is built like a bulldog, with tattoos and chocolate-colored skin\u2014the total opposite of his very blonde, beach-bunny-looking wife. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFlex, he is one of my best friends.

Making sure she\u2019s steady, I give her another kiss.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it; I have two left feet,\u201d she replies, trying to catch her breath.</p><p>\u201cYou are the clumsiest person I have ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve said,\u201d she mumbles.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth, and it\u2019s even documented.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom and her big fat mouth,\u201d she grumbles, looking adorable. Lilly\u2019s mom told me that Lilly would get hurt so much when she was little that CPS were called in to review her case. They didn\u2019t believe that it was the case of a clumsy child until she fell down, splitting her forehead open in the office of the caseworker. She still has a tiny scar to prove it.</p><p>\u201cYou have to admit it\u2019s pretty funny,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cMaybe a little.\u201d She smiles. I stop when Ashlyn grabs my hand, and I pick her up and walk the few steps separating Flex and me.</p><p>\u201cYou really did it?\u201d he asks, pulling me in for a hug. I pat his shoulder and lean back.</p><p>\u201cFlex, Christy, this is my daughter, Ashlyn, and my beautiful wife Lilly. You both already know my little hellion, Jax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJax, my man,\u201d he says, giving Jax a fist bump before he runs off to the other kids. Then Flex reaches over, touching Ashlyn\u2019s hair. \u201cYou look like your old man, pretty girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m a girl; I look like my mommy.\u201d She scrunches up her face, looking all kinds of cute.</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Flex laughs.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ashlyn smiles, then looks over at Jax talking to the other kids. \u201cCan I go play with them?\u201d she whispers to me. I nod, setting her down, and she runs right over to Jax\u2019s side. Flex and Christy\u2019s kids are beautiful, all caramel skin, curly golden hair, and big hazel eyes.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you both,\u201d Lilly says, putting her hand out in Flex\u2019s direction, then she squeaks when he pulls her in for a hug, rocking her back-and-forth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind him, girl. He may look scary, but as you can see, he\u2019s a big teddy bear,\u201d Christy says, giving Lilly a hug. \u201cCongratulations. You\u2019ve got a good man,\u201d she tells Lilly, making her nod.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I kinda lucked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, you should have told us to come earlier so we could watch,\u201d Flex says.</p><p>\u201cNah, I just wanted it to be us and the kids. But you guys should fly out for our reception in a few months,\u201d Cash tells him, slapping his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThat would be good. I haven\u2019t seen your brothers in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re only in town for the night, and the whole time you\u2019re here, you\u2019re gonna be locked up in your room at the hotel? You don\u2019t even want to come to the house and watch a game with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you not hear the part where I just got married to this beautiful woman?\u201d I ask him. He looks at Lilly and smiles.</p><p>\u201cGotcha.\u201d He pulls Christy into his side, kissing her temple. \u201cSo you still want to meet up in the morning for us to drop off the kids and have brunch?\u201d I feel Lilly tense at my side, so I soothed my hand over the smooth skin of her arm.</p> <p>\u201cJax has known Flex, Christy, and their kids his whole life, and they are going to watch the kids overnight for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshlyn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will be fine,\u201d Christy tells her. Lilly looks over to where Ashlyn is playing with the other kids. \u201cIf she isn\u2019t okay, we will call and bring her back to you,\u201d Christy says, and I realize I never even thought about the fact that Lilly has only been away from Ashlyn once, when my mom kept the kids for us. After we talk a few more minutes, we head over to the hotel to get some clothes for the kids. Ashlyn has taken right to Christy and the kids, making Lilly feel better about leaving her with them. Twenty minutes after we get to the hotel, I finally kick everyone out of the room, ready to start our honeymoon. I know one day we will have a real one, but I\u2019m not sure when that will be, so I\u2019m going to enjoy the f**k out of this night while we\u2019re here, and I\u2019m going to make damn sure Lilly never forgets her wedding night.</p><p>I close the distance between us, loving the way she looks in her dress. She is so effortlessly beautiful. \u201cWant to play a game?\u201d I ask her, smiling when her eyes flare.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of game?\u201d She bites her lip, and her breathing has sped up.</p><p>\u201cNaked Hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm...I don\u2019t know. Last time we played Naked House Day, you almost killed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath by cock.\u201d I chuckle, but my smile dies when I notice how hard her ni**les are through the thin silky material of her dress. My hands slide up the curve of her waist, then up, cupping her br**sts. Her head falls back and she moans. I pull my hands away and take a seat, spreading my legs wide. I rub my jaw. Part of me wants to rip the dress from her body, but the other part of me wants to watch her as she undresses slowly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Her eyes dart around the room before coming back to me.</p><p>\u201cI want you to undress for me,\u201d I tell her, palming my c**k through the too-thick material of my tux. I want inside of her so badly I can feel my balls drawing up tight.</p><p>\u201cUndress for you?\u201d she repeats, looking around the room again.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, baby.\u201d Her eyes meet mine, and this time, they are dark with lust. \u201cPull down the top of the dress and let me see your tits.\u201d She looks unsure, but her hands go to her top at the same time I start unbuttoning my dress shirt. Once I have my shirt unbuttoned, I sit back. \u201cPull down the top of your dress.\u201d She looks down at my lap, then back up, her hands running up her sides, over her br**sts, before pulling down the top. Her br**sts are firm and high, and her ni**les dark pink and pebbled tight. I unbuckle my pants and pull down my zipper before pulling my c**k free. Lilly\u2019s eyes flash and she licks her lips. \u201cTug them, baby. Touch yourself how you like me to touch you.\u201d She does, her back arching, eyes closing, and I palm myself, running my hand up and down the length in steady strokes. \u201cPull that dress the rest of the way off.\u201d My voice is rougher.</p><p>I watch as she shimmies the dress down, showing off inch after beautiful inch of skin. Once free of the dress and standing in only a sheer thong and heels, her hands cup her br**sts. \u201cDon\u2019t hide from me; give me what I want. Pull on those pretty little ni**les for me.\u201d Her fingers pull at her ni**les as her eyes watch what my hand is doing. She crosses her legs. I know she\u2019s wet; I can see her arousal. \u201cCome here.\u201d I spread my legs wider so she has room to stand between them. She starts to kneel, but I stop her with a hand on her hip. \u201cNo, I want you to turn around and bend over.\u201d Her breath begins coming out in short pants. She searches my face before turning around. Her beautiful ass is toned and round, giving her body an hourglass shape. Her body curves over, the fullness of her pu**y peeking out from between her legs, showing through the sheerness of the thin material covering her. Running my hands up the outside of her thighs, I feel her shiver under my palms. Once I have her hips in my hands, I pull her back to me, covering her with my mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d she moans. I suck deep over the material before sliding it to the side and licking her again, this time harder. Her legs begin to shake, and placing my thumbs on the outer edges of her pu**y, I spread her open wider, laving her with my tongue, loving the way she tastes. I start working two fingers in and out of her, feeling her begin to clamp down around my fingers. She whines as I pull my mouth away.</p><p>\u201cEasy, baby. I need inside you.\u201d I sit forward, tugging my pants over my hips before ripping her thong from her body. Without warning, I lean forward, pulling her down onto my lap. I run the head of my c**k over her opening and her hips start to grind against me. I lift my hips, sinking inside her slowly until I\u2019m balls-deep.</p><p>\u201cCash,\u201d she whimpers. I hold her in place, enjoying the feeling of being wrapped tight inside her.</p><p>\u201cI got you, baby.\u201d My hands roam her body before one captures a breast, the other zeroing in on her clit. I pull on her nipple at the same time I roll her clit between my fingers. I pull her back against me, rocking my hips in tandem with hers. I know she\u2019s close when I feel her heat start to strangle me. \u201cThat\u2019s it, baby. Come for me.\u201d I bite into her shoulder, pushing her over the edge. She calls out my name, her pu**y contracting around me before her body falls limp against me. I hold her close, enjoying the feeling. My c**k is throbbing; I need to come, but I want to see her face when I lose it inside her. I pick her up off my cock, sliding free. \u201cI need you to stand up, baby.\u201d She does, her legs unstable, so I make sure to hold onto her hips. Once she\u2019s good, I pull off my clothes and pick her up, heading to the bedroom. I lay her on the bed, and looking around, I see that the hotel did as I asked. The bed is covered in rose petals\u2014that may be overkill, but there is also a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. I look at Lilly and her face is flushed, her eyes dark with lust. I climb onto the bed with her, dragging her higher up the bed with me. Leaning forward, I suck one nipple into my mouth, then the other.</p><p>\u201cI need you in me,\u201d she cries, her body writhing beneath me. Her leg wraps around my hip, and her fingers run through my hair. My gaze travels up her body from my marks on her br**sts to her beautiful face.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Lil,\u201d I say, sliding into her. Her eyes stay locked on mine, my mouth lowering to hers.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d she says against my lips. I slide deeper, her nails going to my ass and I know what she wants. I sit up on my knees, wrapping her legs around my thighs, my arms going straight into the bed so I can pound into her harder.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to give you sweet,\u201d I grunt, leaning forward and pulling a nipple into my mouth, sucking hard before biting down.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want sweet!\u201d she cries, her nails digging into my skin. My balls pull up and I thrust harder, each time grinding my pelvis against hers. Her body starts to pull me deeper. I feel the tingle in my spine and my balls draw up tight. I close my mouth over hers, sucking her tongue into my mouth at the same time she tightens and cries out. I lose myself inside her. My weight sinks down on top of her, my body molding to hers and I thrust more gently. My hands go to the sides of her face, I pull her hair away, and I lean forward to kiss her forehead, nose, and then her mouth.</p><p>\u201cHow you feeling?\u201d I ask, whispering against her mouth, enjoying the feeling of having her under me, and still buried inside of her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re really married.\u201d She smiles, one which lights up her whole face. The smile that made me fall in love with her. The smile that she gives my kids, and the smile that I will be blessed with looking at for the rest of my life.</p><p>\u201cBelieve it, baby. You\u2019re my wife.\u201d I smile back.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re my husband,\u201d she says, running her fingers down my jaw.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d I slide out of her, \u201cand as your husband, I\u2019m going to give you a bath and order some food, that way you have enough energy to make it through Naked Hotel Day.\u201d She giggles, rolling away. I stand at the side of the bed and start laughing when I notice that she is covered with rose petals.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d she asks. I pull her out of the bed, sliding a petal off her nipple. \u201cOh.\u201d She looks down at the bed, then between the two of us before cracking up. I don\u2019t have time to think before she runs off. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing until she grabs her phone and I hear the sound of the camera clicking.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a picture of you covered in rose petals. I figure if I ever need to get my way, I can use this to blackmail you.\u201d She laughs as I lunge after her, and when I catch her, I toss her over my shoulder, slapping her ass one time before heading towards the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna pay for that,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you gonna do, spank me?\u201d she asks, and I can hear the need in her voice.</p><p>\u201cNo, you like that too much. I say you\u2019re going to get punishment-by-cock.\u201d I bite the inside of my cheek to keep from smiling. Her eyes narrow, then widen as I slide her down my body before turning, pressing her into the wall. \u201cAre you ready for your punishment?\u201d I press my hips into hers.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she moans as I fill her, giving her the first part of her punishment, then again in the bathroom on the floor, then pressed against the glass windows where we decided to get married this morning, overlooking the little white chapel, and then in bed, where I fall asleep with my wife in my arms.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you!\u201d Jules yells, running out of her apartment. I knew it was coming, I just didn\u2019t know when. I shake my head and roll up the window of the truck. I didn\u2019t want Jax to hear this conversation. We have been home for a week from our trip to Alaska and layover in Vegas, and today was the first time Jules has called and asked to see Jax. I hate taking him to her, but I can\u2019t deny him his own mother. I never want him to look at me and see the person who kept him from her.</p><p>\u201cHey, dude.\u201d He\u2019s looking out the window at his mom when I call his name. His eyes meet mine in the mirror. \u201cI need to talk to your mom for a second, so stay buckled in.\u201d He nods, his eyes going back to Jules. I know he is conflicted about her. Shit, I\u2019m conflicted about her. I f**king hate her guts, but there is nothing I can do because she is the mother of my son, so I\u2019m forced to get along with her. I get out of the truck, shutting the door. I hold up my hand, holding her off until I can get her to the back of the truck. \u201cDon\u2019t start your shit and let my son hear,\u201d I growl.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t start my shit?\u201d She puts her hands on her hips and I know she is itching to fight. She is always ready to fight. \u201cYou got married, and you don\u2019t want me to start my shit?\u201d she asks, glaring.</p><p>\u201cMe getting married has absolutely nothing to do with you,\u201d I tell her firmly. Marrying Lilly was the smartest thing I have ever done, for myself and my kids.</p><p>\u201cMy son lives with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does,\u201d I nod in agreement, \u201cbecause that\u2019s where the courts put him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think he should come live with me.\u201d My fists clench. I have never hit a woman in my life, and never would, but there have been times that I could see myself strangling her for how f**king selfish she is.</p><p>\u201cYou see him maybe every couple of weeks, only when the mood strikes you, and you want him to move in with you? He doesn\u2019t even know you. He can\u2019t even be left alone with you without crying and freaking out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your fault! You have always babied him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is a f**king baby.\u201d I pull off my ball cap, running my hand through my hair. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for this shit today,\u201d I growl, my eyes meeting hers.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure you need to get back to the wife. Good to know she is more important than your son.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFirst of all, unlike you, I don\u2019t place people in my life on different levels of importance. Lilly, Jax, and Ashlyn have all of me, one not more than the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky them, I never got shit from you,\u201d she says with a hurt look, but I have been down this road with her a million times.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. You never had my heart, but you had me. I was there; you were just so caught up in yourself and what you could get that you didn\u2019t give a f**k about me or your son, so don\u2019t try to feed me some sob-story bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a f**king dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to take Jax to the park, or are you gonna hang out with him here?\u201d I\u2019m done with her drama. We will never see eye-to-eye on any of this.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time to take him to the park. I have to be somewhere.\u201d She doesn\u2019t even look disappointed about missing out on time with her son.</p> <p>\u201cWhy the f**k did you ask me to bring him if you don\u2019t have time to visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I would have time, but I got a call right before you got here, and now I don\u2019t have time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d I shake my head in disgust. I knew coming here was going to be a waste of time. I keep giving her chance after chance, hoping and praying that she will change for Jax, or at lease show some interest, but she never does. It\u2019s always the same bullshit. \u201cDo you at least want to say goodbye to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, sure.\u201d She shrugs her shoulders like it\u2019s all the same to her. Then she walks over to the back door of my truck, opening it up. I walk to the front of the truck, opening the door and climbing inside. I listen as Jules tells Jax that she will see him another time. He sits there quietly, not responding. She doesn\u2019t touch him like a normal mother would touch her child after a long period of not seeing them. She doesn\u2019t even talk gently to him like a mother would; her whole demeanor is exactly like it is when she talks to me or one of her friends. \u201cAll right, talk to you both soon,\u201d Jules says as she closes the door of the truck. I wonder if she even notices that Jax didn\u2019t say one word to her the whole time.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, little dude?\u201d I look over my shoulder to talk to him; his tiny jaw is clenched, and I know that he is trying not to cry. He nods his head, and then looks out the window again.</p><p>\u201cCan Mom make cookies when we get home?\u201d My heart aches, and I take a deep breath to try to control my own emotions. Ever since the wedding, he has called Lilly, Mom. I love that he is able to get the kind of motherly love he needs from Lilly, but I f**king hate that he is suffering so badly because of his real mother.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but you can ask her when we get there.\u201d He nods again, resting his forehead against the window. I turn on some music, filling the silence. Once we get back to the house, he is ready to go as soon as I open his door, and before his door is even shut, he is running towards the house yelling, \u201cMom!\u201d at the top of his lungs. Lilly comes to the front door. She is wearing a pair of jeans and a t-shirt, her hair is pulled back from her face with a small clip, and her face is completely makeup-free, showing off her naturally creamy complexion and rosy cheeks. She looks beautiful.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, honey?\u201d she asks as Jax plows into her, his arms going around her thighs. Her hand goes to the top of his head, the other to the back of his neck. He holds on to her for a second and she looks at me; I shake my head, and she nods before looking back down at Jax.</p> <p>\u201cCan we make cookies?\u201d he asks, leaning his head back.</p><p>\u201cWell, your sister and I were trying to make cinnamon rolls. Do you want to come help us?\u201d He nods, unwrapping his arms. \u201cWell, go in and wash your hands. I will be there in just a second.\u201d She runs her hand over his hair as he walks into the house.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but coming home knowing you\u2019re here goes a long way to making it okay.\u201d I pull her towards me by the waist, kissing her lips, then resting my mouth against her forehead.</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t let her stress you out,\u201d she says, her fingers running along my jaw, her touch calming me down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, baby. Let\u2019s go inside; I need to make a phone call, and you need to make me cinnamon rolls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she shakes her head, \u201cI didn\u2019t know I was making you cinnamon rolls; the memo must have gotten lost along the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would deny your husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I would.\u201d She smiles, getting the look she always gets when she looks at me, lighting up her face.</p><p>\u201cYou know what happens when you deny me, right?\u201d I ask, crowding her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asks. I hear her breath hitch and I smile.</p><p>\u201cNever mind, please, don\u2019t make me cinnamon rolls. It\u2019s been awhile since my palm has felt your ass, and you know how I love your ass, baby.\u201d I lean in, kissing her nose, and then I turn her around, giving her a gentle push inside before tapping her on the ass.</p><p>\u201cCash.\u201d She looks at me over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cGot stuff to do, babe.\u201d I walk away smiling, knowing that the minute I can get her alone later tonight is the minute she will go wild for me. The anticipation is going to be making her squirm all day. I walk into my office and set about getting things ordered for the jobsite that we\u2019re starting on next week. Once that\u2019s done, I pay some bills. I need to call Nico, but I know that he has been busy lately. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on with him, but Lil thinks he\u2019s hooked up with someone, and that would make sense. My brother was always around; even with him working for Kenton, he still finds time to come and see us regularly. Nowadays though, we\u2019re lucky if we see him once a week. I pick up my phone and dial his number; he answers on the second ring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, bro?\u201d he answers, sounding like he was sleeping.</p><p>\u201cYo, you asleep? It\u2019s two in the afternoon,\u201d I say, looking at the clock.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was up late,\u201d he says, and then I hear a female in the background calling his name. \u201cJust a second, baby, my brother\u2019s on the phone,\u201d he replies to her, sounding so gentle that I pull the phone away from my ear, making sure I have my brother on the line and not some other Nico. \u201cI\u2019m going to get some water, if that\u2019s okay?\u201d I hear her say. I can tell he has pulled the phone away from his ear to talk to her. \u201cI\u2019ll get you some. Go lay back down, baby. I\u2019ll be right there,\u201d he tells her. I hear the sound of a kiss, and then he\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cYou still there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho are you, and what the f**k have you done with my brother?\u201d I ask him. I have never heard him use that tone with anyone\u2014not the kids, not our parents, and definitely not a female.</p><p>\u201cI found her,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found my boom. I had no f**king clue that returning a lost phone would lead me to her, but I f**king found her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit. Wait, returning a lost phone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLooong story, bro, but I found her, and she is beautiful, and sweet, and so f**king perfect that I worry about touching her and dirtying her up. But I can\u2019t walk away; it\u2019s impossible.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Lil was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLil said that you haven\u2019t been coming around because you got hooked up with someone.\u201d I hear his laugh, and I can imagine him rubbing his head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot more than a hook up, but yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that.\u201d I sit back in my chair and look up at the ceiling. I never thought that our lives would be like this. I knew at one point we would all grow up and find women to share our lives with, but seeing each of my brothers happy, and now having my own family has strengthened my belief that nothing happens before its time. \u201cSo when do we get to meet her?\u201d I ask him.</p> <p>\u201cSoon. She\u2019s just starting to accept that she\u2019s mine.\u201d He laughs when I hear her say something to him. \u201cYou are. Do you need me to prove it again?\u201d he asks her, and that\u2019s my cue to get off the phone.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna let you go,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cSure, man. I\u2019ll call you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to you then.\u201d I hang up, smiling down at the phone. I\u2019m happy that my brother is happy.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you smiling?\u201d I looked up; Lilly\u2019s standing in the doorway holding a small plate with a cinnamon roll on it.</p><p>\u201cIs that for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt depends on who put that smile on your face,\u201d she says, coming towards me.</p><p>\u201cActually, I don\u2019t know what her name is,\u201d I tell her, pulling the plate from her hand, setting it on the desk before dragging her around it so I can pull her into my lap.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know her name?\u201d Her hand comes up to rest on my jaw, her beautiful eyes soft.</p><p>\u201cNo, Nico didn\u2019t tell me her name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was right?\u201d Her face lights up and I shake my head. So f**king cute.</p><p>\u201cYou were, and he seems like he is already lost to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing, right?\u201d she ask quietly, searching my face.</p><p>\u201cIf she is the one for him, then yes, a very good thing.\u201d I palm the back of her head and pull her closer to me. \u201cSo you brought me a cinnamon roll?\u201d I change the subject.</p><p>\u201cNo, I brought it in here to eat it while you watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She smiles, looking sexy.</p><p>\u201cI have a better idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Her tongue comes out, licking across her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cSave it for later when then kids are in bed and I get you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asks breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cYou said you brought it in here to eat in front of me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re going to eat it in front of me later wearing nothing, and anything you drop I\u2019m going to eat using no hands.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she moans as I lick into her mouth, tasting cinnamon and sugar. And much later that night, I taste cinnamon and sugar from other parts of her body.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Lilly</p><p>\u201cMommy, this is so heavy!\u201d Ashlyn says. She\u2019s carrying one bag of groceries while I carry ten so I can avoid a second trip out to the car.</p><p>\u201cJust a second, love bug, let me get the door unlocked.\u201d I finagle the bags so I can get my hand up high enough to shove the key into the lock. Once the door is open, Ashlyn walks ahead of me and starts dragging the bag she\u2019s carrying across the floor into the kitchen. I laugh as I watch everything that was once in the bag fall out as it tears open from being dragged as she walks.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took Jax to see his mommy,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says unhappily as I heft the bags up onto the counter. Once I\u2019ve gotten free of the bags I\u2019m carrying, I shake out my arms, trying to get the blood to flow again. \u201cWhen is Papa Bear going to get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have talked about this ten times today.\u201d I smile. \u201cRemember, I told you he and Grandma will be here in three weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d She shrugs and starts walking out of the kitchen, leaving the mess of cans she dropped along the way on the floor. \u201cHey, go pick up all the stuff you dropped please,\u201d I tell her. She goes, but I can hear the slight stomp of her feet. She has had a long day and is tired and cranky. I\u2019m feeling tired and cranky myself. Jules had called early this morning. She told Cash that she had to see Jax today because she was going out of town and wouldn\u2019t be able to see him for a week or so. All I could think was good riddance, our lives were better without her in them. I start putting everything away when I hear the doorbell ring; I don\u2019t know who it could be. No one would show up without calling first. I look through the side window, seeing Officer Dan is on the other side of the door. Once I finally get the door open, I can tell by the look on his face that this isn\u2019t going to be a pleasant visit.</p><p>\u201cHi, can I help you?\u201d I ask, looking behind him when I see another officer walking up the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to do this to you, Lilly, but I\u2019m going to need you to come with me,\u201d he says, and he does look sorry, but that does absolutely nothing to make me feel better. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat is this about?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cThere has been more evidence brought forward in the case against you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I being arrested?\u201d I question.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says, and my stomach drops, and I know I\u2019m going to be sick. I look down when I feel Ashlyn\u2019s hand in mine. I really hate that she is here to see this.</p> <p>\u201cCan you go get Mommy\u2019s phone?\u201d I ask her. She looks up at Officer Dan before nodding and walking into the house.</p><p>\u201cCash isn\u2019t here right now, and I can\u2019t leave until I have someone here to take care of Ashlyn,\u201d I explain, rubbing my hands together.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s understandable, Lilly. We can wait here until you find someone to come watch her. I also called Tom on my way over and told him what\u2019s going on. I suppose he is going to be showing up soon,\u201d he says, looking concerned.</p><p>\u201cCan you please not handcuff me in front of my daughter? I really don\u2019t want her to get upset. I promise that I will fully cooperate.\u201d I wrap my arms around my waist.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t cuff you until it\u2019s absolutely necessary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cHere, Mommy,\u201d Ashlyn says, handing me my phone. I pull up Cash\u2019s number; it rings once before he answers.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe, we just got to the park. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOfficer Dan is here at the house,\u201d I say, hoping he understands that I need him to come home. I really do not want to have a conversation about this with Ashlyn standing right here.</p><p>\u201cWhy is he there at the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs me to go with him,\u201d I say closing my eyes. \u201cI need you to come get Ashlyn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, baby, everything is going to be all right. I\u2019m on my way home. I\u2019m going to call my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I reply. I want to cry, but I know I can\u2019t in front of Ashlyn. I really do not want her to get upset.</p><p>\u201cLove you, baby, hang in there. I\u2019m on my way now,\u201d he says before hanging up. I pull the phone away from my ear.</p><p>\u201cHe is on his way.\u201d I take a step back, opening the door more fully. \u201cWould you like to wait inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, honey. Why don\u2019t you g\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, you know that\u2019s not allowed,\u201d the office behind him says, and Dan turns to look at him.</p><p>\u201cOfficer Mitchel, I suggest you stand down,\u201d Dan replies, stepping into the house. He doesn\u2019t wait for the other officer to come in before he shuts the door. I walk into the kitchen, looking around at all the groceries that still need to be put away. My eyes land of Ashlyn, who looks worried, and I hate seeing that look on my baby\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cCome here, love bug.\u201d Ashlyn comes to me and I pick her up, wrapping myself around her and breathing in her smell. I hate the idea of being away from her, Jax, or Cash for any length of time. Ashlyn doesn\u2019t fight me; she must know something is going on. After a few minutes, I hear a car outside. I stand in the living room watching the front door. As soon as it opens, my stomach drops. It\u2019s not Cash, but his dad.</p> <p>\u201cHey, honey,\u201d he says, and I hold Ashlyn a little tighter. I really don\u2019t want to leave until I\u2019m at least able to see Cash, but I wonder if I will be allowed to wait until he gets here.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cGrandpa!\u201d Ashlyn says and starts to wiggle, trying to get down, and as much as I don\u2019t want to, I set her down and watch as she runs to James.</p><p>\u201cHey, pretty girl,\u201d he says, swinging her up into his arms. Dan looks at me, and I know he is silently trying to tell me that we need to go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, James, but I need to take Lilly with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Can you wait until my boy gets here?\u201d James asks.</p><p>\u201cI really shouldn\u2019t have let her stay as long as I have, but I knew she needed to wait until someone got here to stay with her daughter,\u201d Dan says, looking upset. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to bring the girl with us and get CPS involved.\u201d I feel nauseated by his last words; the thought of Ashlyn being put into the system, even for a short period of time, makes me feel grateful to Dan.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d James says. He looks at me, and I can tell he\u2019s worried. I know that Dan said he called James before this, so I wonder if he knows about what\u2019s going on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very sorry, Lilly, but we\u2019re going to have to go,\u201d Dan says. I walk over to James and Ashlyn; her head is laying against his chest. I want to pull her away from him, but I just can\u2019t do it. I know that I need to put on a brave face for my girl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with Dan. Can you be a good girl for Daddy until I get back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have to go?\u201d she asks, and I take a breath before answering.</p><p>\u201cHe just needs to ask me some questions.\u201d I look at Dan, and he looks at Ashlyn and nods. \u201cCan I get some love before I go?\u201d She looks unsure before leaning away from James so I can grab her. Once I get her in my arms, I whisper into her ear, \u201cLove you, love bug. Be good, okay?\u201d She nods and I feel tears start to fill my eyes. I know I need to leave before she has the chance to see me upset. I hand her back to James, who leans close so he can whisper to me that everything will be okay. I grab my bag off the counter and follow Dan out of the house. Once we\u2019re at his squad car, I\u2019m read my rights and placed in the backseat just as Cash pulls up with Jax. I lower my head. I really don\u2019t want Jax to see me like this. I know that my mascara has started to run down my face, and I try as best as I can to wipe the tears away before Jax can see them. Cash comes to my door and squats down in front of me.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d he says, his fingers tilting my face up. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay. I called the lawyer on the way over here and he said he would meet you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I tell him, trying to be brave. Something in my gut tells me this isn\u2019t going to be so easily fixed.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d I reply, and I can hear Jax begin to shout from off in the distance.</p><p>\u201cWe need to go,\u201d Officer Mitchel says, standing behind Cash with his hand on the door. I can tell he is becoming impatient.</p><p>\u201cJust give me a minute,\u201d Cash growls, standing to his full height. \u201cDad, let Jax come here for a second,\u201d Cash yells, and I hear the pounding of Jax\u2019s feet on the gravel, then he is there, wrapping his arms around my neck.</p><p>\u201cHey, honey.\u201d I try to smile, but I feel it wobble.</p><p>\u201cWhy are the police taking you away?\u201d he asks. I pull him away from me so I can see his face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOffice Dan needs some help with something and has some questions for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen are you coming home? We were supposed to make pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can make pizza another night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p> <p>I run my hand over his head, trying my best not to cry. \u201cI have to go.\u201d I see his eyes get wet and my heart breaks. \u201cI want you to take care of your sister until I get back, okay?\u201d He nods, biting the inside of his cheek. I pull him into me and kiss the top of his hair before helping him down from the car.</p><p>\u201cGo wait with Grandpa, little dude. I\u2019ll be there in a second,\u201d Cash tells Jax, who reluctantly walks back up to the front porch where Cash\u2019s dad and Ashlyn are standing with Dan. He resumes his place, crouching down inside the door, his fingers running down the side of my face. I close my eyes. \u201cI will see you in a couple hours, okay?\u201d I nod, but the lump in my throat won\u2019t let me talk. \u201cI love you, baby.\u201d I nod again.</p><p>\u201cWe need to go,\u201d Office Mitchel says. I take my eyes off Cash to look at Officer Mitchel. When Cash\u2019s hand slides to the back of my neck, his fingers tangling into my hair, my eyes return to his. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too,\u201d I finally speak.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, baby. Things will be okay.\u201d He pulls my upper body forward, and as soon as I\u2019m close enough, his mouth opens over mine, and he kisses me so thoroughly I forget where I am. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon, baby,\u201d he tells me one last time, pressing his forehead against mine.</p> <p>\u201cSee you soon,\u201d I agree, untangling my hands from his hair. He kisses my forehead before standing. He hesitates before shutting the door. His hand goes to the glass, and mine does the same. He turns to say something to Officer Mitchel before his eyes come back to me. I hate the worried look on his face. He steps away from the squad car and goes over to where his dad is standing. Ashlyn puts her arms out in his direction, and the second he has her, she wraps herself around him, his face going near her ear. I can see his mouth moving, and I watch her nod. Jax has his head back listening to what his dad is saying to his sister. I know he\u2019s upset when his eyes come to me and I see tears in them. I\u2019m so lost in watching my family that I jump when I hear the car door slam closed.</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s going to be your ass on the line if someone asks about what happened today,\u201d Officer Mitchel says to Dan.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna say something?\u201d Dan questions.</p><p>\u201cN-nu...No,\u201d Officer Mitchel stutters.</p><p>\u201cSo how the f**k is anyone going to know that we didn\u2019t follow procedure?\u201d Dan growls, backing out of the driveway.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, just...what if they wonder why it took so long, or why she\u2019s not cuffed?\u201d he asks, sounding contrite.</p> <p>\u201cSo you wanted me to handcuff her in front of her daughter, even though she was fully cooperating with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what the f**k are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we shouldn\u2019t show favoritism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I have known James for the last twenty years. He is a good man, and from what I know, his boys are good solid men too. Yes, Lilly has been accused of a crime, but until she is found guilty, she is innocent. No, I didn\u2019t cuff her. She also has no history of violence and has cooperated since the beginning of this investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, you made your point,\u201d Officer Mitchel says, looking out the window. We drive the thirty minutes in silence, and once we pull up outside of the precinct, Officer Mitchel gets out, opening my door. His hand goes to his back, and I hear the distinct sound of metal and know what\u2019s coming. My stomach rolls, and I swallow against the nausea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about this,\u201d Officer Mitchel says, and I can hear his sincerity. Once I\u2019m cuffed, the weight of the metal on my wrist feels like a thousand pounds. I\u2019m lead inside the police station by Dan with a hand wrapped around my elbow. He directs me to a small room that has a long metal table and a large mirror across from where I\u2019m seated.</p><p>\u201cWe will be back in a few minutes, darlin\u2019,\u201d Dan says, and I nod looking at myself. I wonder how the hell this kind of thing keeps happening to me. It takes about twenty minutes for Dan and Officer Mitchel to come back into the room. Dan un-cuffs my hands but places a cuff around my ankle so that I\u2019m attached to the chair.</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say softly, rubbing my wrist. I can still feel the cold weight of the cuffs even now that they are gone.</p><p>\u201cAll right, let\u2019s get started,\u201d Dan says, pulling out a large envelope. I watch as he opens it and starts pulling out papers. I can see my name and copies of checks; my breathing picks up and I start to feel lightheaded. Even knowing I didn\u2019t do what I\u2019m being accused of, I still feel guilty that my name is involved. \u201cNow, as you know, the last time that we brought you in we didn\u2019t have enough evidence against you to charge you with a crime,\u201d Dan says and I watch him take a deep breath before his eyes come back to me. \u201cUnfortunately, that has changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whisper, looking at myself in the mirror. This all feels like I\u2019m living a bad dream.</p><p>Cash</p><p>\u201cHow much f**king longer are they going to keep her in there?\u201d I roar; the rage inside of me is burning so brightly I could explode.</p><p>\u201cSon, you need to calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down? Fuck that! Dad, she has been in jail for a week now!\u201d I shout. It\u2019s killing me having her away from me and the kids, and worse, knowing that she\u2019s in jail, when she of all people should never even know what the inside of a jail cell looks like.</p><p>\u201cSon, you going off half-cocked isn\u2019t going to help anyone, and it especially will not help Lilly right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, you and I both know that Lilly is not built to be in a place like that with real criminals,\u201d I tell him, something he already knows. Yesterday when I went to see her, I could see it in her face that she was exhausted. I knew my dad was doing everything in his power to keep her away from the general population, but he could only do so much, and his friends could only do so much without making it look like favoritism, risking all of their jobs.</p><p>\u201cCash, I promise you I\u2019m doing everything in my power to get her out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I sit down in one of my parents\u2019 lawn chairs. \u201cDid they get the video from the check cashing place?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s being reviewed now,\u201d he tells me, sitting down across from me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen will they know something?\u201d I ask, dropping my head forward.

I feel like I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d I scrub my hands over my face. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m dying inside.\u201d I look at my wedding band, rubbing my thumb over the shiny piece of jewelry. \u201cHer parents are going to be here today. I have to take the kids with me to go pick them up. Her mom and dad are going to have a lot of questions\u2014questions I don\u2019t have answers for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will come with you. The kids can stay with your mom. You and I will go to the airport and pick them up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say, not looking up at him. I have already failed Lilly as her husband. What kind of man lets his woman go to jail? I don\u2019t deserve her. \u201cI have never deserved her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, none of that feeling sorry for yourself bullshit,\u201d my dad says, and I realize I must have spoken out loud.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right. You probably don\u2019t deserve her, but she\u2019s yours, and I raised you to be a good man, a strong man, and a man worthy of a good woman\u2019s love.\u201d He stands and pats my shoulder. \u201cYou need to be strong for her and those two little ones.\u201d I know he\u2019s right, and I won\u2019t let my kids be touched by what\u2019s going on, but it doesn\u2019t make it any easier to look at myself in the mirror. The worst part is that Jules is claiming me to be an unfit parent, and at this point, the judge is considering joint custody due to her claims about my wife\u2014though Jules has been gracious enough to tell me that if I left Lil, she would be willing to let things be. I let her know where to shove that idea. There were no forces on this Earth strong enough to tear me away from Lilly. Just because I wasn\u2019t good enough for her doesn\u2019t mean I would ever give her up.</p><p>\u201cI got it,\u201d Nico says the second he steps through the sliding glass doors.</p> <p>\u201cPlease tell me that it\u2019s good,\u201d I say and stand up.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k are you talking about? I want to see what\u2019s on the tape,\u201d I say, sliding open the door he just came through.</p><p>\u201cWait, we need to talk for a second before I put this in,\u201d Nico says, grabbing my elbow.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You have a tape that proves that Lil is innocent and you want me to wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want to make sure that you know that no matter what\u2019s on this tape, we\u2019ve got your back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJesus, you still don\u2019t trust her,\u201d I whisper in disgust. I haven\u2019t even thought once that she may not be innocent. I know that she didn\u2019t do what she is being accused of.</p><p>\u201cDid I say that I didn\u2019t believe her?\u201d Nico asks, shaking his head. \u201cDude, I know she didn\u2019t f**king do it. The thing I want you to prepare yourself for is what else is on this tape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will see, but know that we\u2019ve all got your back.\u201d I lift my chin, wondering what the f**k is on the tape, feeling like I don\u2019t even want to know at this point. We walk into my parents\u2019 house where the kids and I have been staying since she got placed in jail. I don\u2019t want to be home without her, and I know that with us staying at my parents\u2019 they seem to have fewer questions about where she is. That doesn\u2019t mean that when bedtime, bath time or any time that they normally spend with her during the day comes along they don\u2019t cry for her or look around waiting for her. That\u2019s the part that kills me. I hate seeing that lost look on my kids\u2019 faces. It has been bad enough dealing with the look on Jax\u2019s face over the past couple years when his mother doesn\u2019t show up. But now it\u2019s worse knowing that if Lil had it her way, she would be with them. This isn\u2019t something that she is choosing to do. \u201cYou ready for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut it in,\u201d I tell him. He sets up the video and my dad comes into the room, taking a seat in his old recliner. I sit on the couch and wait for the blank screen to light up.</p><p>\u201cAll right, now, the first part of the tape is all garbage, just normal people cashing their checks. Then around two, something interesting happens,\u201d Nico says, and I watch the screen go black.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k did you do to the tape?\u201d I stand up.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d He shrugs like it\u2019s all the same to him, and then stands as well. \u201cSo I\u2019m guessing that you didn\u2019t catch it, huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCatch what?\u201d I growl. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood for your f**king games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to play it again; calm your tits.\u201d He smiles. \u201cThis time, pay close attention to what happens right before the screen goes black. He presses play again, and this time I stare at the screen so hard that I feel like my eyes are going to dry out, but right before the screen goes black, I catch it.</p><p>\u201cYou have got to be f**king with me.\u201d I take a breath and then another, trying to squelch the urge to find a gun and put a bullet in someone\u2019s brain.</p><p>\u201cI guess you caught it that time,\u201d Nico says smiling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to f**king kill her,\u201d I say, my hands fisting at my sides.</p><p>\u201cNow, son,\u201d Dad says, and I hear him, but I couldn\u2019t f**king care less right now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to f**king kill the bitch,\u201d I repeat.</p><p>\u201cCash, son, I need you to calm down and think about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has done it again. She has f**ked with my life again.\u201d I close my eyes, images of Lilly when I first met her flashing in my mind\u2014how the love we had for each other back then could have grown, and how lucky I am to have it now. Images of Ashlyn come next, everything I missed with her, all the moments I will never get back. Then Jax, and how my son has suffered having her as a mother. How until Lilly, he never knew what it was like to have a mother who loved him completely. Yes, I\u2019m going to kill the bitch. \u201cWhere the f**k is she?\u201d I ask, looking at Nico. Now he has Sophie, he should know the anguish I\u2019m feeling.</p><p>\u201cJules doesn\u2019t know I have this tape,\u201d Nico says. \u201cI say we call the lawyer and have him get this tape admitted into evidence, then Lilly can finally get her chance in front of the judge. Hopefully, he will look at this and realize he has the wrong person and let her go.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but that\u2019s not a lot of evidence proving her innocence,\u201d I realize and speak out loud. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey took writing samples from Lilly that say that she is not the one who wrote those checks.

I sit back down, scrubbing my hands over my face.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to go get her parents?\u201d my dad asks.</p><p>\u201cNah, I need to get out of the house.\u201d I stand, and after we say goodbye to the kids, we head out to my dad\u2019s truck.</p><p>After we pick up Lilly\u2019s parents from the airport, the lawyer calls and tells me Lilly has seen the judge, and he is releasing her on bail. The tension that had been weighing heavily in the car since we picked up her parents disappears with that one call. I have never felt such a sense of relief in my life. Now I just pray Nico finds a way to clear her name completely. I also want Jules to go down for what she did.</p><p>I drop Lilly\u2019s parents off at the house. Yes, I know they want to see their daughter, and the kids want to see her too, but I don\u2019t give a f**k. I need her to myself for at least a little while.</p> <p>Chapter 14</p><p>Lilly</p><p>I look down at the sudsy water I\u2019m washing dishes in, enjoying doing something so normal. I missed being home the last week. Jail is scary and lonely, and I never want to go back to that place. The second I was free, I ran to Cash and cried into his chest. I missed his smell and the way I felt when he held me. I missed our kids too, and couldn\u2019t wait to be home with them. On the way home, Cash explained to me about Jules and what happened with her. No one has been able to find her yet, but I hope they catch her soon. I need to know why she did it. I look up from the soapy water and out the window. The kids had been playing in the tree house, but have now disappeared. I don\u2019t think much about it until twenty minutes later when I realize I haven\u2019t heard anything from them for a while. Since I got home, they have been coming in to check if I\u2019m still here every ten minutes or so. I step out the backdoor into the yard. It\u2019s completely quiet out here, not even the sound of leaves moving with the wind.</p><p>I walk around the side of the house to see if maybe the kids are there playing...but nothing. I get a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach, and that\u2019s when I take off running. I look everywhere and I can\u2019t find them. I run back towards the house, trying to catch my breath. \u201cWhere are the kids?\u201d I run into the house screaming. \u201cI can\u2019t find the kids anywhere! They were out back playing in the tree house. I had been watching them through the window above the kitchen sink. Then they disappeared. I thought that they had decided to play along the side of the house, but I wanted to check on them to make sure they were okay when I didn\u2019t hear anything for a few minutes.\u201d I know I\u2019m rambling, but I feel sick, and I know I\u2019m going to have a break down.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re outside honey,\u201d my mom says, and I start shaking my head, clutching at my throat, trying to rip the words out but I can\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, baby,\u201d Cash says, concerned. His arms are around me, but I push him away; he needs to go look for the kids.</p> <p>\u201cTh-they\u2019re not there!\u201d I take a huge gulp of air. \u201cI can\u2019t find them anywhere!\u201d My dad is the first to move. He is up off the couch and heading out the backdoor. Cash looks me over before handing me off to my mom, and then he follows my dad.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay. They\u2019re kids, honey. I used to lose you all the time,\u201d Mom tells me, trying to lighten the mood. Any other time I would have laughed, but not now. I get up and head towards the bedrooms, checking each one, but they are nowhere to be found. A few minutes later, I hear police sirens and my stomach drops. My worst nightmare is becoming a reality. When I get outside, Cash and my dad are talking to James. A few minutes pass and the whole yard is full of people. My mom holds me next to her as we listen to the guys plan out a search party. No one knows where they are, so they all split up.</p><p>Jax</p><p>I always wanted a little brother, but got stuck with a little sister. We are playing hide-and-seek, and when I\u2019m getting ready to find her like I always do, I see someone pulling her into a truck. I\u2019m scared, but my dad always says that it\u2019s my job to keep her safe because I\u2019m her big brother. So I climb into the back of it and lay down, hiding under a tarp.</p><p>Cash</p><p>This cannot be f**king happening. Someone is going to die. I\u2019m not saying that as a threat\u2014I mean it all the way to my soul. As soon as I find out who has done this, I\u2019m going to kill them.</p><p>\u201cAll right, man, I want you to hear me out, okay?\u201d Nico says. I lift my chin in response. I\u2019m too angry to answer him right now. We have searched everywhere for the kids, and come up with nothing. They wouldn\u2019t have wondered off. Someone has to have taken them, I just don\u2019t know who.</p><p>\u201cWho do you think would do this?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I rack my brain, trying to come up with someone who would do this. I can\u2019t think over the pain in my chest. My kids are missing; someone has them and I have no idea who it is.</p><p>\u201cI want you to think for a second. Who would do this?\u201d I pause, coming up with nothing, then for some reason a name comes out of my mouth without thinking.</p><p>\u201cJules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJules,\u201d he nods, \u201cyou know she has been missing. Kenton is running her cards to see if he can latch onto her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not that crazy,\u201d I say, knowing it\u2019s a lie.</p><p>\u201cShe is that crazy.\u201d He pauses, looking like he is weighing his words. \u201cLook, I know you feel bad for her, and I understand that she is Jax\u2019s mother, but the bitch is f**king crazy and needs some major help\u2014and not the kind that she can receive from a therapist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, now I need you to tell me anything you know about her and her family,\u201d he says, and for the next thirty minutes, I tell him everything that I know. When I\u2019m done, I realize how very little there was. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna find the kids; don\u2019t worry.\u201d He pats my back, walking away and putting the phone to his ear. My phone buzzes in my pocket, and I answer right away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still looking,\u201d Trevor says; he and Asher took off not long after my dad did. \u201cAny idea of which way we should head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook for Jules,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI talked to Nico and I think he may be right; we need to be looking for Jules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re f**king shitting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, I don\u2019t know what the f**k to think right now, but something in my gut is saying Nico is right and that Jules is behind this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, we will look for her. Keep us up-to-date if you find out anything,\u201d Trevor says, and I can hear the anger in his words.</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d I say and then hang up. I head back into the house. Lilly and her mom are inside waiting to see if the kids will show back up. As soon as I walk inside, Lilly is in my arms, her eyes red from crying.</p> <p>\u201cDid they find them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby.\u201d She starts to cry again, and my heart is breaking. \u201cI will find them and bring them home. You stay here with your mom in case they show back up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but maybe I should be out looking too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want you to stay here in case they come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts. Stay here with your mom. Keep your phone on you and I will call you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, just bring them home.\u201d I can hear the strain in her words as she wraps her arms around my waist, burying her face in my chest. I want to comfort her, but I need to be out looking. I pull her away from me, kissing her once before turning and heading out the door. I see Nico still on his phone, so I motion him towards the truck and climb inside. Once he\u2019s in, I take off. I have no destination in mind, but I do know Jules had been sleeping with a guy in town, so that\u2019s my first stop. When we arrive at his place, there is an old truck in the driveway. The yard is littered with garbage. We get out and head up to the front porch; the dogs behind the door go crazy when I knock. I hear rustling, then the door opens and a guy my age is standing there rubbing his face, the smell of alcohol wafting off him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Jules?\u201d I ask, and his eyes narrow. He looks between Nico and me then smirks.</p><p>\u201cI know you,\u201d he says when his eyes come back to me.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I ask him, crossing my arms over my chest.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re Jules\u2019s ex. She\u2019s always talking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he slurs, and until that point, I didn\u2019t even notice that he is drunk. \u201cShe was always carrying on about you and how she was never important to you, and that you only wanted her because of the kid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me everything. The bitch never shut the f**k up.\u201d He runs a hand through his hair. \u201cYou know, she is hot as f**k, and not bad in bed, but she is nuts\u2014and I mean really f**king nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d Nico asks, leaning on the side of the house. His stance is casual, but I can tell that he is up to something.</p><p>\u201cThe last time she was here I thought I was going to get some, but she carried on about your daughter and wife\u2014who, by the way, is a hot piece.\u201d I want to punch him in the face, but don\u2019t let it show.</p><p>\u201cShe is hot, right?\u201d Nico asks, and I swing my head to him. What the f**k?</p><p>\u201cFuck yeah, she is. I mean, Jules is good looking, but that bitch is smoking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Nico says, and the guy smiles at him. \u201cSo what else did Jules want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t really listening; I was trying to get laid, you know?\u201d Nico nods and he shifts, his head going back like he\u2019s thinking. \u201cAll I remember is her saying that the girl was a mistake on her part, and that she should have been smarter\u2014whatever the f**k that means.\u201d He digs his hand into his front pocket, pulling out a pack of smokes, offering one to Nico, then to me. We both shake our heads no. He puts one in his mouth, lighting it and taking a drag. \u201cI really don\u2019t remember anything else.\u201d He shrugs, taking another drag before tossing the still-lit cigarette into the yard. My brain is in overdrive; she told him Ashlyn was a mistake on her part. I know deep down she is the reason Lilly got pregnant, but there is no way to prove it. I know that if confronted, she would deny it.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where she might be?\u201d Nico asks him.</p><p>\u201cJules?\u201d he asks, and Nico nods. \u201cI don\u2019t know, at her house? Or with her f**ked up aunt maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d he finally asks the question he should have asked a long time ago.</p><p>\u201cMy son and daughter are missing,\u201d I tell him honestly. He looks between Nico and me, then backs up.</p><p>\u201cHey, I have nothing to do with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t say you did, but we need to know if you have any idea where Jules might be,\u201d Nico says, and the guy looks nervous.</p><p>\u201cYou think that Jules has something to do with it?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not sure right now; the only thing we know for sure is that Jules has disappeared, and so have my kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, that\u2019s f**ked up.\u201d He shakes his head. My phone rings and I pull it out of my pocket, looking at the caller ID. I have no clue who it is.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, sir,\u201d an older woman says.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d I ask impatiently. I don\u2019t have time for this shit right now.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m calling you because a little boy showed up on my property about five minutes ago. He says that his sister was taken by his mom, and that I needed to call his dad.\u201d My hand that\u2019s not holding the phone goes to my chest where my necklace lays. I put pressure on it, the metal against my skin reminding me that my family will be back together soon.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d I ask, jumping off the porch and heading to my truck. I get in and slam my door at the same time as Nico. She quickly rattles off her address. \u201cLet me talk to my son, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d Jax cries. \u201cMom took Ashlyn. I had to go with her to keep her safe, but she took her into a house, and there was a lot of shouting, Dad. So I ran as fast as I could until I found somewhere to call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did good, dude. I\u2019m so proud of you. But I need you to be brave for a little while longer, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Dad.\u201d I hear him sniffle, and I fight not to crack my phone.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Jax, and I will be there soon,\u201d I tell him, clenching my teeth. A drive that would normally take forty-five minutes takes twenty. My dad gets ahead of us on the highway in his squad car, leading a long line of cars and trucks. The old lady Jax is with explains that he had ran through a cornfield that is on the back of her property, and that no one else lives close enough to her that would know we are on their trail. When we arrive at the location where Jax is, we all get out of our vehicles just as Jax comes flying out of the house, right into my arms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI got you,\u201d I tell him, picking him up. He wraps himself around me, his body shaking. \u201cYou\u2019re safe, bud, but I need you to tell me where your sister is.\u201d He nods into my shoulder then starts talking, his body shaking so hard that I have to sit down with him. He tells me that he and Ashlyn were playing hide-and-seek and that he knew where she was hiding because she always hides in the same place. He says he went around the side of the house, seeing someone dressed in black carrying Ashlyn away. He was going to go into the house to get me, but they were almost to the truck by the time he thought about it. Then he says when the person placed Ashlyn in the truck, he climbed into the back and laid down to hide. When the truck finally stopped, he peeked over the edge, seeing his mom carrying Ashlyn into a house. He didn\u2019t know what to do when he heard yelling coming from the house, so he ran to try to find someone to call me. I hold him close, rocking him back-and-forth the same way I used to when he was a baby. My dad, brothers, and a couple other officers listen. It only takes him a couple of minutes to tell us what had happened, but I know that it\u2019s a couple minutes too long. \u201cListen, little dude, you\u2019re going to stay here and I\u2019m going to go with Grandpa so that I can get your sister and we can go home,\u201d I tell him. I stand and carry him over to my truck. Asher takes him from me, talking gently to him as I head over to my dad.</p><p>\u201cLook, I shouldn\u2019t even let you come with us, but I know that I won\u2019t be able to stop you, and Ashlyn is going to need you when we get her out of there.\u201d My jaw clenches, but I hold my tongue. Right now, he isn\u2019t my dad, he is a cop, and I know the difference. \u201cWe\u2019re going to head across the field the same way Jax came. When we get there, I need you to stay out of sight with Nico until I give you the go-ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d I tell him. All of us head across the cornfield. Once we reach the other side, there is an old, rundown, two-story white house; the place looks like it\u2019s ready to fall apart, but parked outside is Jules\u2019s old car, along with a small pickup. My dad waves me back and tells me to stay put as he and three other officers head towards the house. I fight myself, wanting to go in and get my girl, but I know my dad will handle it. Two of the officers head around each side of the house. My dad and the other policeman walk up the front porch. My dad knocks with his gun trained on the door. He yells out it\u2019s the police, and when the door is opened, a man with a gun holstered on his shoulder answers the door. The guy nods to my dad, they talk for a second, and the guy pulls a shiny badge out from under his shirt. They talk a second more, and my dad waves Nico and me in. When I get to the porch, the guy looks me over, introduces himself as Jim, then heads inside. The house is a mess, the living room right off the front entrance has the ceiling falling in. We walk down a narrow hall into what used to be a kitchen. That\u2019s where I see Jules handcuffed and sitting in a chair, along with another man. \u201cWhere the f**k is my daughter?\u201d I ask, and her eyes widen in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI did this for us,\u201d Jules says in a whisper, and if I had a gun right then I would have put a bullet in her.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever the f**k you did, you did it for yourself,\u201d I growl. \u201cNow where the f**k is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, man, your daughter is in here,\u201d Jim says. He takes me into a pantry off the kitchen. When he opens the door, he shines a flashlight into the small space, and there is my baby girl asleep on the floor. I rush over, picking her up. She is out cold, her body completely limp.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d I ask in a panic, lifting her higher up on my chest.</p><p>\u201cThey roofied her. I checked her over already. All of her vitals are okay; she is just asleep,\u201d he tells me. I swear I can feel my body expand with rage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to f**king kill her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to wait in line. Where she is going, they don\u2019t take too kindly to people hurting kids, and I\u2019m telling you that everyone in the prison will know what she did. I will make it my personal goal to let everyone she has contact with know her history.\u201d His face is devoid of any emotion, and I don\u2019t give a f**k what they do to her. I don\u2019t care if that makes me an insensitive prick, but I hope she gets what\u2019s coming to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly was her plan?\u201d I ask him, looking down at the sweet face of my baby girl.</p><p>\u201cShe was going to sell her to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have been working this case for a while. The man in the other room is part of a child trafficking network. I have been undercover for a while now. He told me he had a piece of property for me to pick up and to meet him here. I did, and when I got here, the woman and child were here with him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re f**king with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, man. I wish I was, but this shit is a lot more common than you think, and the sad thing is that normally the kids don\u2019t have people out looking for them,\u201d he says, and I hear sirens off in the distance. I say a prayer for all the kids who don\u2019t have anyone searching for them. I would be lost without my kids.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I tell him, my voice gruff with emotion. He pats my shoulder before giving it a squeeze. We walk back out to the kitchen; my ex and the guy with her are still sitting at the table. I don\u2019t even look at them. My dad is there with a couple of his officers, but I walk past them all, heading outside. Once I clear the door, I see there are three black SUVs filling the driveway. Jim, who comes outside as well, goes to talk to some of the men exiting the vehicles. I sit on the steps of the porch holding Ashlyn. I don\u2019t know what I would have done if something had happened to her, or if I had lost her permanently. I would be devastated. I look up to see Nico holding out a phone to me, and when I put it to my ear, I know exactly who is on the line. \u201cBaby, I got our baby girl. She\u2019s okay,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cJax?\u201d she questions.</p><p>\u201cHe is with Asher and Trevor.\u201d I can hear a loud thud and I know that she has fallen. Tears start to fill my eyes. I hold Ashlyn a little tighter, closing my eyes.</p><p>\u201cPlease bring them home soon,\u201d she cries. I can hear her mom talking to her, and I know that she is comforting her, which makes this a little easier.</p><p>\u201cI will. Love you, baby,\u201d I tell her. An officer comes over, telling me that an ambulance is coming and that we should wait in one of the SUVs. I look through the front window of the SUV, seeing that Nico is standing with our dad on the front porch. His phone is to his ear, and I hope that he called Trevor and Asher. I need my son, but I don\u2019t want him to see what\u2019s going on. I watch as they escort Jules and the man out of the house and into the back of one of the vehicles. The vehicles carrying them takes off and an ambulance pulls up, along with Asher\u2019s truck. I hop out, taking Ashlyn to the ambulance. When I get her inside, they start looking her over. All of her vitals are fine, her O2 level normal. They hook her up on fluids and get her comfortable. I get out and take Jax from Trevor, who tells me that he had fallen asleep crying. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou gonna take him with you in the ambulance to the hospital?\u201d Trevor asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Can you call Lil\u2019s dad and ask him to bring the girls to meet us at the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it. Do you want one of us to ride with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d I tell them, walking away. I get back into the ambulance holding my son and looking at my daughter. They are both so small and defenseless. When we get to the hospital, there is a blur of activity. We\u2019re escorted into a room, and the doctors run more tests on Ashlyn, who still hasn\u2019t woken up.</p> <p>\u201cCash!\u201d I hear yelled, and I stand with Jax still in my arms. He still hasn\u2019t woken up either. I had the doctor look him over and they said that he is fine, probably just crashed from having an adrenalin rush. When I clear the doorway, Lilly is running towards me still yelling out my name. When she sees Jax and me, her eyes close and she stops in the middle of the hall. I go to her, needing to touch her.</p><p>\u201cBaby, they are both okay,\u201d I tell her, holding her with one arm. Her arms wrap around Jax and me, and we stand there for a few minutes before I kiss her forehead and grab her hand, leading her to Ashlyn. Once in the room, she goes right to her bedside, looking down at our daughter who looks so fragile.</p><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t she awake?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know, but they said she is fine. Her vitals are all normal and she doesn\u2019t have any injuries; it just looks like she doesn\u2019t want to wake up yet. Neither of them wants to wake up yet.\u201d We wait for what seems like forever in silence for Ashlyn to wake up, and when she does, she doesn\u2019t even know what happened to her. She has no recollection of Jules at all. The police and everyone believe she was drugged while in the yard. My brave son, who had the courage to follow his sister, woke up not long after her. I can tell he\u2019s still upset about what happened, but he\u2019s happy to have his sister back, and us all together. That night, when we finally get home, and after getting everyone tucked into our bed, I thank God for keeping my family safe and together. None of us are going to be out of each other\u2019s sight for a while. I think Lil and I both need to be able to see the kids at all times for about the next six months.</p><p>Ironically, that happens to be around the time that Jules gets sentenced to twenty years in jail without the possibility of parole. The crimes against her are numerous, and she is proven guilty with each and every one of them. I sit down on the couch, and Lilly cuddles into my side while Jax and Ashlyn argue over which movie we are going to watch. I don\u2019t care what I do with my family; as long as we are together, I\u2019m a happy man.</p> <p>\u201cThank you for giving me this,\u201d I whisper into Lilly\u2019s ear. Her head turns towards me, her eyes searching my face.</p><p>\u201cYou know that you give us everything, right? You are the like the moon to our family ocean. You\u2019re magnetic; we will always follow you and try to give you back what you give to us.\u201d She leans up and kisses me before laying her head back against my chest. I don\u2019t know what I did to deserve her or my children, but I will always do everything within my power to keep them safe and happy.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Sophie</p><p>\u201cMom, Dad, can you guys stop being so gross? No one wants to see their parents making out,\u201d Ashlyn says walking into the living room.</p><p>\u201cYeah that\u2019s some sick shit,\u201d Jax says, following behind his sister and ruffling her hair. She punches him in the arm in response.</p> <p>\u201cHey, mouth,\u201d I scold.</p><p>\u201cSorry, but really, why don\u2019t you guys try acting like normal parents?\u201d Jax complains flopping down onto the couch.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, you got a room,\u201d Cash says and Jax rolls his eyes shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cI had to come in here, I need some extra money. I\u2019m taking Becky to homecoming.\u201d Jax says, his eyes lighting up and I inwardly growl. I hate that Jax is grown up. I was putting is his laundry away the other day and found a half a box of condoms. Condoms, I didn\u2019t even want to think about him having a penis let alone him using it on anyone.</p><p>\u201cChris asked me to go with him,\u201d Ashlyn says jumping up making Cash\u2019s eyes narrow. I know exactly what\u2019s coming so I sit back on the couch.</p><p>\u201cYou are not going,\u201d Cash says.</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that, sis,\u201d Jax laughs, getting off the couch and leaving the room.</p><p>\u201cDad, if Jax can date, then I should be allowed to date too,\u201d Ashlyn says, her eyes narrowing on her father. I try not to laugh, but it\u2019s funny watching Cash try to come up with an excuse for why his sixteen-year-old son can date, but his sixteen-year-old daughter can\u2019t. His eyes meet mine and narrow. I give him my best \u2018I\u2019m innocent\u2019 smile, making his jaw tic. After everything that happened, we agreed to not have any more kids. We both just wanted to enjoy Ashlyn and Jax without adding another baby to the bunch. Besides, everyone had gone baby-crazy, and there were plenty of Mayson children to occupy everyone.</p> <p>\u201cI have told you before that you\u2019re a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m a girl, Dad, but I really wanted to go to homecoming with Chris. It\u2019s not fair that Jax gets to go and I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to help me out here?\u201d He looks at me, and I shake my head no. He mouths the word \u2018spanking\u2019 and I tighten my thighs in response. I don\u2019t know how it is for other married couples, but for us, our sex life has only improved with time. He knows exactly how and where to touch me, or what to say to have me craving him all day, so that when we finally connect, I jump him. I think it\u2019s why he does what he does.</p><p>\u201cDad, this is not fair,\u201d she whines, then looks at me. \u201cMom, tell him that it\u2019s not fair.\u201d She stomps her foot.</p><p>\u201cCash, this is not fair,\u201d I tell him, trying not to smile.</p><p>\u201cSee, Dad? Mom agrees that it\u2019s not fair.\u201d Cash looks at me over her head, and I know that whatever punishment I get tonight is going to be good.</p><p>\u201cHoney, you have to agree that it\u2019s not fair for Jax to go when she can\u2019t,\u201d I tell him honestly. I try not to get involved with things like this, but it\u2019s ridiculous that he lets Jax do whatever he wants, while Ashlyn is supposed to be locked away in her room.</p><p>\u201cShe is younger than him. They are only the same age for a few months, so I do think it\u2019s fair,\u201d he growls at me, and I hold up my hands.</p><p>\u201cI never get to do anything!\u201d she cries, and that is a total crock. She gets her way, just like now. The only thing she has to do is wait it out, and her Dad will crack and agree to let her go. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Cash says, and just like that, Ashlyn won another round and she knows it. She makes it obvious by throwing herself at Cash.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best dad ever!\u201d she cries. He wraps his arms around her, kissing her forehead, and then she\u2019s gone, bouncing to her room.</p><p>\u201cYou know that your daughter is a f**king handful,\u201d he grumbles, his hand coming down on either side of me.</p><p>\u201cShe is your daughter too,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cShe is all you, baby, so sweet when she needs to be, but a dog with a bone when the time calls for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think those are your traits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that you\u2019re getting punished for going against me in front of her, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t you Cash me, baby. You earned this shit.\u201d I don\u2019t know why he always says it like a threat, when in reality, it\u2019s a reward and makes me want to be bad and go against him all the time.</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to Jax about the condoms?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cI had the bird and the bees talk with him. And I know that you don\u2019t like it, and you still think of him as your baby, but he is growing up; he will be seventeen soon.\u201d I do still think of him as my baby, because he is. Jules has been in jail since she kidnapped Ashlyn. I was afraid at first, but my boy is so strong that he pushed through everything and ended up shining even brighter because of it. Jules is still in jail and has never once tried to contact him or Cash, or if she did, I don\u2019t know about it. Cash nuzzling my neck brings me back to reality.</p><p>\u201cHey, what are you doing?\u201d I try pushing him away. \u201cAnd what the hell do you mean that he\u2019s all grown up? I still buy his underwear, so until I stop doing that and he starts doing it for himself, he is not grown up.\u201d Cash starts laughing, his whole body shaking mine, and his face goes into my neck. I roll my eyes, running my hands through his hair.</p><p>\u201cI love you, baby,\u201d he says once he gets control of himself. He lifts his head, looking at me. He still looks at me like I\u2019m the most important thing in his life. Yes, he feels the same way about his kids, but each of us gets a different look from him.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d I whisper, looking into his handsome face. He was even more handsome than he was a few years ago. Age has made him even sexier, and I think having a happy home life makes his soul happy enough to shine through.</p><p>Cash</p><p>\u201cDrop the towel and get on the bed,\u201d I tell Lilly as soon as I walk into the room. She doesn\u2019t even hesitate; her eyes darken and she walks right to the bed, lying down. \u201cGood girl, now spread,\u201d I command her, and she does as I say, her breath increasing. \u201cYou know, I should spank you for not agreeing with me about Ashlyn this morning, but since I know that you like that shit so much, I\u2019m just going to give you a different kind of punishment,\u201d I tell her, stripping off my clothes. I walk to the edge of the bed, my hand on my dick working myself in smooth strokes. Her eyes are watching, and I know she loves to see me touch myself. She always thinks she can get away with everything, and most of the time that is the truth, but not this time. This time she is going to pay. I\u2019m not ready for my daughter to date, and I need Lil onboard with me. I get up off the bed, kneeling near her head. \u201cOpen,\u201d I tell her, and she does what I say, her mouth opening eagerly. I feed her my c**k inch-by-inch; her eyes light up when my hand goes to her breast and I pull on one nipple, then the other, getting them hard. Her body is writhing, wanting more contact. I move my hips, f**king her mouth. \u201cFuck, yes, just like that,\u201d I encourage her. \u201cNow lift your hips so I can play with your pu**y, baby.\u201d She does, and my fingers make contact with her clit before sliding two inside. \u201cYou\u2019re soaked,\u201d I growl and she nods, grinding her pu**y against my hand. I play with her some more, then pull away when I feel her body tell me she\u2019s close. She whines, but she doesn\u2019t stop sucking me off. I pull her ni**les again before going back to her pu**y. She is in a frenzy; I can see it in her eyes. I pull my dick out of her mouth and position my head between her legs, propping her feet on my shoulders. My mouth latches onto her; my whole face is soaked with her arousal. I add a finger, and when I know she\u2019s close, I sit up. I want so badly to f**k her, but not yet; she needs to learn.</p><p>\u201cCash!\u201d she cries.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna side with Ashlyn again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her whole face is flushed, her lips swollen. Jesus, she is beautiful.</p><p>\u201cYou sided with Ashlyn. You gonna do that shit again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I say no, will you make me orgasm?\u201d she snaps.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you say it and mean it, Lil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I will only side with you.\u201d And that\u2019s all I need to bury my face in her pu**y. My arm wraps around her thigh and I slide two fingers inside her. She comes, and her orgasm is so powerful I\u2019m surprised she doesn\u2019t buck me off her and the bed. Once she\u2019s settled, I flip her to her stomach, lift her ass, and slide home. I pound hard, her ass moving with every stroke.</p> <p>\u201cLift your ass, Lil,\u201d I growl, my c**k balls deep inside her. I love her ass; I love the way it moves when I f**k her from behind, and I definitely love this position. \u201cHigher.\u201d I slap her ass hard, watching my handprint appear on her creamy skin. I still love when she wears my mark. I don\u2019t think she has gone one day without a hickey or some other mark from me somewhere on her body since we got back together.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Cash. I\u2019m going to come,\u201d she cries, shoving her face into the pillow.</p><p>\u201cI know, baby. I feel you starting to squeeze the f**k out of my cock.\u201d I ram her harder, beginning to feel my balls pull up, and the tingling in my spine intensifies. Her hips start thrusting back against me harder. I wrap a hand around her waist, running it down her stomach and over her clit. She cries out again, her wetness and the silkiness of her walls closing tightly around me from her orgasm, making me come hard inside her. I slow my strokes, drawing out each of our climaxes before falling to the side and bringing her with me. She turns around, crawling on top of my chest. I run my fingers through her now-blonde hair, trying to get my breathing to calm.</p><p>\u201cYou know you can punish me anytime, right?\u201d she jokes, making me smile.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d I give her a squeeze. \u201cBut I\u2019m serious, Lil, against the kids, we are a unit. If you think I\u2019m doing something wrong, we talk that shit out in private. I know that you and Ashlyn both think I\u2019m not fair between her and Jax, and a lot of times I\u2019m not, but I have my reasons. She is a girl, and she\u2019s vulnerable in ways that Jax isn\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she agrees, and I pull her hair so that she is forced to lift her head.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYeah, since you put it like that, okay.\u201d She shrugs and lays her head back down. \u201cLove you,\u201d she says, kissing my chest then snuggling closer.</p><p>\u201cLove you too, baby,\u201d I whisper, closing my eyes and following her off to sleep.</p>   </body></html>"]
