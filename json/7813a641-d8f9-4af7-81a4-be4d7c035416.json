He was covered in something slick, and it dripped down his flesh. It looked reddish, like blood, as if the kid had run off the set of a horror movie after being drenched in buckets of the stuff.</p><p>Sam slammed his foot on the brake pedal, grateful for once that his years with Mahon, Mero and Malone had given him the ability to afford the new Jaguar with the stop-on-a-dime brakes.</p> <p>Even then, the car pulled to a halt just inches before the boy.</p><p>Swearing softly beneath his breath and puzzled beyond measure, Sam jumped out of the car. \u201cHey, what the hell are you doing there, son?\u201d</p><p>The boy didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t seem to realize that he\u2019d nearly been roadkill. He just shook as he stood there. Summer had recently turned to fall, and the air had a sharp nip, typical for Massachusetts at this time of year. Tree-laden tracts lined the road; the old oaks seemed to bend and moan with the breeze, while multicolored leaves danced on the road and swept around the scene as if they, too, were deeply disturbed.</p><p>The boy didn\u2019t acknowledge Sam or look at him.</p><p>Again Sam swore softly. There was obviously something really wrong, though this kid couldn\u2019t have been injured severely and still be able to stand as he was.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t have lost that amount of blood and still be conscious.</p><p>Was it really blood...couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>Either way, Sam couldn\u2019t leave him in the middle of the road.</p><p>He looked at the new Jag he really loved, with the leather seats he also loved, and walked around to his trunk and found the beach blanket he\u2019d picked up on his recent drive to the Florida Keys. It was sandy, but it would warm the kid.</p><p>He returned quickly, but the kid hadn\u2019t run off, much less moved. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>He received no response.</p> <p>\u201cHere, here, you\u2019re going to have to get into my car,\u201d Sam said, approaching the boy with the blanket. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you to a hospital.\u201d</p><p>Sam wrapped the blanket around him. \u201cSorry about the sand,\u201d he said.</p><p>The kid looked to be somewhere between fifteen and seventeen, but underdeveloped. He was painfully thin. His eyes were huge and brown in the lean contours of his face. His chest was devoid of hair, so most of the blood had slid down his chest.</p><p>The temperature seemed to be around forty degrees Fahrenheit. It wasn\u2019t freezing, but the kid shouldn\u2019t be exposed to this long.</p><p>Sam intended to get him into the car. And yet, as he stood there, trying to be compassionate while saving his wool coat from the sticky red substance that looked like blood, he suddenly froze.</p><p>It didn\u2019t just look like blood\u2014it was blood.</p><p>Denial rushed through his mind.</p><p>But it was blood, no denying it.</p> <p>Pig\u2019s blood, cow\u2019s blood...hell, rabbit\u2019s blood.</p><p>But something told Sam that it was not.</p><p>He drew the blanket off the boy and turned him around, seeking an injury that might have caused that amount of blood.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t find any. If he had, the boy wouldn\u2019t have been standing upright. He wouldn\u2019t have been breathing. He\u2019d have been dead from a wound like that.</p><p>He\u2019d already wrapped the blanket around the kid. No undoing that.</p><p>And if he could, would he leave the kid there shivering with nothing?</p><p>Still standing in front of the boy, who didn\u2019t even reach up to hold the blanket in place, he fumbled in his pocket for his cell phone and hit 911. An operator with a droning voice asked him what his emergency was.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Samuel Hall. I was driving into Salem when I nearly hit a young man in the road. He\u2019s covered in blood. It doesn\u2019t appear to be his blood, but I can\u2019t be certain that he isn\u2019t injured. He\u2019s standing on his own, and doesn\u2019t seem in any way to be too weak to do so, but he\u2019s nonresponsive. He may be in shock. Can you get someone out here\u2014fast?\u201d He looked around and quickly gave his position as best he could. Hell, it was a quiet backwoods road. He\u2019d opted to take IA north from Boston, but had turned off early. The dark, quiet road through the trees had seemed a soothing path for his first visit home in a long time.</p><p>\u201cStay calm now, Mr. Hall,\u201d the operator told him. \u201cI\u2019ll have a car out to your position immediately. Patrolmen are in the vicinity. It won\u2019t be long. You\u2019re sure the young man isn\u2019t bleeding? If so, you must stanch the flow of blood. Stay calm. Are you doing all right?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated for the fraction of a second, staring at the phone, his mind racing. He thought of the horrors he had witnessed in the military, and he thought of the crime-scene photos he\u2019d studied as a criminal attorney.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d he said, his voice even and strong, \u201cI\u2019m about as calm as a dead Quaker. But you need to get someone out here fast. I\u2019m going to suggest you send an investigator, because I have a feeling this might be human blood, and I don\u2019t want to compromise any more evidence than I already have by putting my blanket around the boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, sir. Please remain on the line. And do your best to remain calm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you tell me to remain calm one more time, I\u2019m going to implode and become consumed by spontaneous combustion\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s already a car on the way. Sir, you just have to remain calm. This is Salem, Massachusetts, sir, and we are moving into the Halloween season now, you know. You may be the victim of prank. Now, stay on the line, and remain calm, Mr. Hall.\u201d She gasped suddenly, her well-learned rhetoric failing her for a moment. \u201cOh, you\u2019re the Sam Hall\u2014\u201d</p><p>He heard the sound of a siren then. \u201cThey\u2019re here\u201d is all he said. \u201cThanks.\u201d He hit the end icon on his phone.</p><p>A patrol car pulled up on the road in front of him, and the glare of its lights met and mingled with the Jag\u2019s headlights, almost blinding him for a minute. Two uniformed officers exited from either side of the car, guns in position.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not armed!\u201d Sam called. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s in shock. He needs medical attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn ambulance is on the way,\u201d the driver called out. \u201cAnd Detective Alden. I radioed him on my way out.\u201d</p><p>Alden? He wondered if it was his old friend John. Puritan names still abounded here, and John Alden and he had been on the football team together. John had always wanted to be a cop, a detective, actually. He must have worked his way up through the ranks.</p><p>The patrolmen walked forward, slowly holstering their guns as they saw that the shaking youth carried no weapon and that Sam seemed nonthreatening, as well.</p><p>\u201cPatrolman Nathan Brewster,\u201d one said, introducing himself. \u201cAnd my partner, Robert Bishop.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded. \u201cSamuel Hall,\u201d he said, but the patrolmen were just staring at the boy. They glanced at each other uneasily.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, Detective Alden is on his way. Any minute now,\u201d Brewster said, almost as an afterthought.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Sam asked. The two were behaving curiously. They had holstered their weapons but appeared ready to spring for them again at any second.</p><p>Neither touched the boy. Neither spoke to him. The kid was shaking harder and harder, despite the blanket Sam had set around his shoulders. Neither did the boy make any attempt to hold the blanket to his bony frame.</p><p>Again, the two exchanged glances. \u201cWe\u2019re not really at liberty to say, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, well, I think we have to get him into a heated car, or he\u2019ll die of exposure pretty soon,\u201d Sam said. True or not, he couldn\u2019t bear watching the shocked youth stare wide-eyed at nothing and shake anymore.</p><p>But before the patrolmen were compelled to respond, the sound of sirens suddenly seemed to grow to an alarming pitch. First on the scene was an unmarked car. A grim, solid-looking man of about fifty in a worn woolen coat and plaid sweater exited the driver\u2019s side of the car and strode quickly toward them.</p><p>Plainclothes cop. Detective, Sam thought. He hoped it was John.</p><p>And it was.</p><p>But unlike the others, he didn\u2019t pull a weapon. He hurried forward, passing between the patrolmen and Sam and the youth. He didn\u2019t look at Sam, but at the boy, and his expression wasn\u2019t authoritarian or harsh, but sad.</p><p>\u201cMalachi,\u201d he said. \u201cGood God, Malachi, you\u2019ve done it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me. He\u2019s shivering. He\u2019s freezing. He\u2019s in shock. John? It\u2019s Sam\u2014Sam Hall.\u201d</p><p>John Alden turned and looked at Sam.</p><p>\u201cSam!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was on my way to the folks\u2019 place. I nearly hit the boy. He was just standing there, in the road. Covered in blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam,\u201d Alden repeated.</p><p>He looked as if he was about to say good to see you or something to that effect, but in the road with a blood-splattered boy, it just wasn\u2019t appropriate.</p><p>\u201cJohn, this kid needs help. I think he\u2019s in shock,\u201d Sam repeated.</p><p>John Alden nodded and indicated, with the cast of his head, the ambulance that had arrived. \u201cYeah, he\u2019ll get medical attention. And he\u2019s in shock, you say? He should be. He just hacked his family to death.\u201d</p><p>1</p><p>Lexington House.</p><p>There it stood, on a cliff by the water. It might have been a postcard or a movie poster, and it was as eerie as ever\u2014a facade that graced the darkest horror movie. Its paint was chipping, the exterior was gray and it had been weathered through the centuries by icy winds ripping in off the Atlantic Ocean. The ground-floor windows seemed like black eyes; the second-floor windows might have been startled brows, half covered by the eaves of the roof.</p><p>Oddly enough, Lexington House had always remained in private hands. From its builder\u2014the Puritan Eli Lexington\u2014to its recent owner\u2014the now deceased Abraham Smith\u2014it had always found a new buyer after each and every one of its tragedies. People had once known its early history, of course, but that had been lost amid the witchcraft trials that scarred American history and continued to fascinate the social sciences. And when Mr. and Mrs. Braden had been brutally murdered two centuries later, in the 1890s, the world knew that their son had been guilty of the crime. But the legal system had worked for the killer this time, and he\u2019d been acquitted. He and his sister had promptly sold the house to another private party. Eighty years later it had become a bed-and-breakfast, and then it had been purchased by Abraham Smith, who had longed for the property on its little cliff, segregated from all but a few neighbors. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One of whom had been murdered last week.</p><p>And now today...</p><p>Jenna Duffy had heard about nothing but the Lexington House on the radio since she\u2019d started for Salem from Boston this morning. Uncle Jamie had called her days before, begging that she come to Salem and speak with him. Peculiar timing.</p> <p>She\u2019d pulled to the side of the road and parked to stare at the place.</p><p>A patrol car sat near the house; crime-scene tape cordoned off the entire house. There were no onlookers, though. The house was at a little distance from the historic section of town, where most visitors strolled through the Old Burial Ground, visited the House of the Seven Gables or sought out history at any one of the witch museums or the Peabody Essex Museum. And since it was October and Halloween was approaching, the real-life contemporary tragedy would fuel the ghost stories that were already being told around town.</p><p>She stared at the house awhile longer, wondering about its history. What happened at Lexington House would prove to be another horrible case of mental instability or greed, and as much as she longed to actually see the property that brought about such gruesome tragedy, she had a meeting with her uncle. She glanced at her watch and pulled back onto the road. With Halloween tourists clogging the city, it might take her time to get where she was going.</p><p>Somehow she was still early.</p><p>She parked her car at the Hawthorne Hotel\u2019s parking lot, and wandered across the street to the common.</p> <p>Autumn leaves, beautiful in their warm orange, magenta and yellow colorings, rustled beneath Jenna\u2019s feet as she strolled. Before her and around her, the leaves swirled and lifted inches into the air as the breeze picked them up and whimsically tossed them about.</p><p>She heard the laughter of schoolchildren as they made their way through Salem Common, heading home but not too quickly. Autumn was certainly one of the most beautiful seasons in New England, and schoolchildren, raised with all the colors as they may have been, still loved to stop and lift the leaves, toss them about and roll in them.</p><p>Jenna had loved Salem since she\u2019d first come to the States and her parents had chosen nearby Boston, Massachusetts, as the place to begin their new lives. They had come up here weekends, in the summers and for the Halloween festivity, and also for the fall leaves and to see Uncle Jamie.</p><p>But this was a difficult visit. She was about to meet Uncle Jamie at the Hawthorne Hotel, and she was worried about him. He\u2019d been so anxious when he\u2019d asked her to come. He was asking her in a professional capacity, but he didn\u2019t want her bringing \u201cyour team\u201d or \u201cyour unit\u201d or \u201cthe official group\u201d with which she worked, not yet.</p><p>As she walked across the common, her attention was drawn back to the children. A group of five-to seven-year-olds were holding hands, running in a circle and playing a game.</p><p>She froze as she heard them reciting the old rhyme repeated not just in this area, but around the country.</p> <p>Oh, Lexington, he loved his wife,</p><p>So much he kept her near.</p><p>Close as his sons, dear as his life;</p><p>He chopped her up;</p><p>He axed them, too, and then he kept them here.</p><p>Duck, duck, wife!</p><p>Duck, duck, life!</p><p>You\u2019re it!</p> <p>Jenna felt as if ice water had suddenly been injected in her veins\u2014the old ditty now seemed to be words of mockery and cruelty. A young woman, who had been standing with another group of parents watching over small children and a group of older teens who had gathered in the park, rushed forward. She caught hold of the little boy\u2019s arms, spun him around and shook a finger at him, reprimanding him.</p><p>Another of the mothers came hurrying over to her, her voice carrying in the cool air. \u201cCindy, don\u2019t be so hard on them! They don\u2019t...know. We used to say that rhyme all the time when we were kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha, I know, it\u2019s just that...now? Now, with what\u2019s happened again? It\u2019s that house! That horrible house, and that boy... He used to go to school with our kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, it\u2019s over now, Cindy. It\u2019s over. They have the boy in custody.\u201d</p><p>Other parents began calling out sharply to their children. The two women herded the children toward the group of parents. A tall man in the group said something sharply to the teens, words that Jenna couldn\u2019t quite hear, and they disbanded, as well. The conversation they all exchanged became whispers. The families and the unattached teens began to drift away, as if none of them wanted the reality of the situation.</p><p>The great seafaring days of Salem were in the past. The city survived on tourism, and most of it wasn\u2019t because of the autumn leaves. Salem had been the site of the infamous Salem Witch Trials\u2014and it had also been the site of two horrendous and savage murdering sprees.</p><p>And, now, a third.</p><p>Tragic incidences of human ignorance and brutality in the past were one thing; bloodletting in the present was quite another, especially with the town anticipating the season\u2019s mammoth number of visitors. The income generated by the holiday alone could sustain many a shopkeeper and inn through the brutal New England winter to follow.</p><p>Of course, for Uncle Jamie, the recent tragedy would not be in any way fiscal but personal. She knew Jamie and loved him dearly, because he was a man who took the troubles of others to heart. This was often to his own detriment, but that was Jamie.</p><p>From her vantage spot, she could see the Salem Witch Museum with its English Gothic facade across the street on North Washington Square\u2014the point where she always told friends to begin their exploration of the city. In a comparatively short presentation, the museum did a fine job of explaining the climate of the city during the days of the infamous trials. The statue of Roger Conant, town founder, stood proud before her as well, larger than life, his heavy cape appearing to blow in the same breeze that tossed the leaves about.</p><p>The residences and businesses surrounding the common were decked out for fall. Pumpkins and black cats adorned windows and lawns, while skeletons and, naturally, witches dangled from branches. Some people were more into the traditional concept of fall itself, and they had decorated with scarecrows, feathered turkeys and cornucopias. The image of the city of Salem she saw as she stood in the common was that of old New England, family and festivity, tinged with the strange pleasant warmth of the coming of fall.</p><p>She glanced at her watch again. It was time to go and meet Uncle Jamie; she suddenly realized she had been dreading the meeting, and she didn\u2019t even know why.</p><p>Sam poured himself a second cup of coffee and looked around the house, trying to concentrate on its details and trying to make up his mind. He didn\u2019t like wondering what the hell he was going to do about the house, but it was better than thinking about the bizarre and tragic circumstances under which he had finally made it home.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to get involved\u2014he wasn\u2019t staying here. He\u2019d already taken a nice long leave of absence, and it was time to go back to work. But, then, he mused, maybe he shouldn\u2019t. He\u2019d not only saved his client from prison, but he\u2019d proved beyond a doubt that the man not only deserved to be declared innocent, but was, in fact, innocent. And he was still a bit worn down from all the effort.</p><p>Sam had really stepped on every rung of the ladder on his way to becoming a renowned attorney. He\u2019d worked in the D.A.\u2019s office following college and the military. He\u2019d worked as an investigator as well before joining his first small firm, because his boss had needed an investigator more than another attorney in the office. He\u2019d learned the ropes from Colin Blake, Esquire, and he\u2019d come to terms with a sad truth: a defense attorney was still required to give his best effort in a legal defense, even if he thought his client was guilty as all hell. He\u2019d learned to make the cops and the prosecutors suffer, but discovered he didn\u2019t much like that side of the business. Still, despite that, he wasn\u2019t sure he could ever go back to being a prosecutor. It wasn\u2019t the money. Well, it was about money. Often. It was sometimes about the money it took to put together a great team of defense attorneys. He\u2019d seen a young woman sent to prison for years, convicted of the murder of her newborn. He\u2019d seen a rich young man walk on drug charges, and a poor one sent up fifteen years for the same offense. He understood the law; he didn\u2019t understand why the slow wheels of Congress took so long to correct the inequities that were to be found in so many instances. He was violently opposed to the death penalty, always afraid that somewhere, sometime, it would send an innocent person to his or her death, and yet he understood the desire others felt to see it utilized. Too many drug lords, murderers and rapists made it back onto the street.</p><p>But last night...</p><p>Something about the kid he\u2019d come upon in the street was still tugging at his heartstrings.</p><p>The kid, according to police, had axed his family to death.</p><p>There was no doubt that Malachi Smith\u2019s father, mother, grandmother and great-uncle had been murdered, and horribly so. Jumping on the internet that morning, he\u2019d seen that the news regarding the killings had gone global. Abraham Smith, sixty-two, Beth Smith, fifty-nine, Abigail Smith, eighty-three, and Thomas Smith, eighty-seven, had all died from exsanguination\u2014Beth, Abigail and Thomas all receiving at least eight blows from a honed ax, Abraham over twenty. The previous week, a neighbor, Mr. Earnest Covington, had been found hacked to death on his parlor floor. Six months earlier, a Salem native living in nearby Andover had been found murdered in his barn. Police had been following leads and now suspected that the cases were related.</p><p>Indisputable evidence indicated that the youngest son of the Smith family, Malachi, was the killer. The police had the young man in custody, and he remained under guard in isolation at a correctional facility hospital.</p><p>The Smiths were the current owners of Lexington House, famed for its bloody reputation. The family had adhered to strict fundamentalist teachings, being members of the Old Meeting House in Beverly, Massachusetts. This was a strange connection of sorts with the original murders in the place. In the midst of the witchcraft trials, Eli Lexington had murdered his family with an ax. He\u2019d been imprisoned with the nearly two hundred arrested for witchcraft at the time. Then he disappeared. There were no records of his fate after prison. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then, in the late eighteen hundreds, Mr. and Mrs. Braden had been killed in the house, as well. A historical parallel of the Menendez case? From the books, movies and court records that had come down through time, it appeared that a disgruntled son had killed his parents for the money. And, of course, similar cases had been suspected elsewhere. The Braden case was similar, too, to the Lizzie Borden murders. Both Lizzie and the Braden boy had been acquitted, but nobody doubted that each of them had murdered their families.</p><p>Just like today\u2019s case.</p><p>Sam told himself over and over to get the hell away from his computer. He was not involved.</p> <p>But he was.</p><p>He\u2019d found the kid in the road.</p><p>And, he\u2019d grown up in Salem. He could still remember being a school kid, and the rhyme every school kid in the area had learned. Oh, Lexington, he loved his wife...</p><p>A good attorney, of course\u2014even a hack\u2014would go for an insanity plea. The kid had grown up in what everyone in the area termed a haunted house\u2014a really haunted house\u2014which, in a city like Salem, was saying something.</p><p>Any attorney could defend the boy. It was too easy.</p> <p>He forced himself to leave the computer screen and walk around the house.</p><p>His parents had been dead for nearly two years; he\u2019d returned for the funeral, and he hadn\u2019t been back since. The house, however, was in excellent shape. His father, until his death, had seen to it that no electrical wires frayed, that the heating system was state-of-the-art and that every board that even seemed slightly damaged was replaced. His father\u2019s friend and contractor, Jimmy Chu, had kept the house in good repair during the two years. His dad had come from old Puritan stock, and he\u2019d considered it an honor to care for the home that his parents had owned, just as his grandparents before them did. It wasn\u2019t one of the oldest houses in the area, but it ranked right in there with many of the homes surviving from the turn of the eighteenth century all the way into the twenty-first.</p><p>He smiled suddenly, shaking his head and taking a sip of the coffee he still held, untouched. \u201cDarn you, Dad. You knew that I won\u2019t be able to sell the damned thing!\u201d</p><p>A house\u2014in a city in which he no longer lived\u2014was a pain in the ass, no matter what. He guessed that his father had always figured he\u2019d come home one day.</p><p>Well, he\u2019d managed to, but on the wrong damned day. He dropped his head. He didn\u2019t want to be involved with a legal situation here.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t blink without seeing in his mind\u2019s eye the blank brown eyes of the naked boy covered in blood and shaking on the road.</p> <p>\u201cJenna!\u201d Uncle Jamie drew her to him, giving her a warm and emphatic hug.</p><p>She hugged him in turn. She loved Jamie. She loved her family in general. Despite their long history of warfare, the Irish were an exceptionally warm, passionate and profuse people. They were full of magical tales, and they seldom felt obliged to refrain from speaking their minds.</p><p>\u201cUncle Jamie!\u201d she said.</p><p>He pulled her away for a moment, holding her at arm\u2019s length to study her. Jamie had brilliant green eyes and graying auburn hair. He was her mother\u2019s younger brother, and had always had a mischievous side to him, making him very popular among children. He was so devout that he\u2019d nearly gone into the priesthood, but had decided at the last minute that he didn\u2019t really have the calling. He\u2019d attended medical school and become a psychiatrist instead.</p><p>\u201cYou look good, my girl, aye, that you do! Pretty thing, you always were. Beautiful eyes, green like Eire, and hair like fire\u2014you got my sister\u2019s temper to go with it, eh?\u201d Her own accent had become little more than a hint of a different place, but she had come to the States when she\u2019d been a young teen. Jamie had been a grown man.</p><p>\u201cMum\u2019s temper isn\u2019t that bad, Uncle Jamie. She\u2019s a lot like you\u2014opinionated.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cCome over here, I\u2019ve a booth for us,\u201d he told her. He slipped an arm through hers, leading her toward a corner booth. \u201cLovely, lovely, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019ve always loved this city. You have the Wiccans with their wonderful shops\u2014and their Wiccan gossip and squabbles, of course! You\u2019ve got the immigrants and the old Puritan families, and all of them getting along\u2014and not. But fall here is the most wonderful season in the world\u2014everyone loving life and creating cornucopias and carving out pumpkins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I love it here, too, Uncle Jamie.\u201d</p> <p>He looked around and motioned to the waitress. \u201cWhat will you have, niece?\u201d</p><p>She was surprised to feel a sudden chill. Jamie was hedging, and he usually just spoke plainly. It was unusual that he\u2019d dawdle by ordering like this, but she decided she\u2019d let him talk at his own speed. \u201cSomething warm,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cAn Irish coffee?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she said.</p><p>Their waitress was wearing a cute, short-skirted pirate costume. Jamie asked to make sure that the bartender used Jameson Irish whiskey, and that they didn\u2019t go putting a wallop of \u201cwhite stuff\u201d\u2014whipped cream\u2014on either drink. The waitress smiled. \u201cJamie, you order the same thing every time you come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I do,\u201d Jamie told her, grinning. \u201cBut, still, a man\u2019s got to be careful when he orders his drink.\u201d</p><p>Laughing and shaking her head, the waitress moved on with a swish of her short skirt.</p><p>\u201cThey do get into Halloween early, don\u2019t they,\u201d Jenna murmured.</p><p>\u201cWell, you know the whole pumpkin-carving thing is Irish, of course,\u201d Jamie said.</p><p>\u201cI know, Uncle Jamie...\u201d she said to the familiar information, knowing it wouldn\u2019t stop him. She thanked the waitress as she delivered their drinks. Jamie didn\u2019t seem to notice.</p><p>\u201cIt all came from Stingy Jack,\u201d Jamie said, studying his cup, and speaking to himself more than her.</p><p>\u201cA myth about a man named Stingy Jack,\u201d Jenna reminded him.</p><p>He waved a hand in the air.</p><p>\u201cThe devil invited old Jack to have a drink with him, and Jack, he wasn\u2019t about to pay for the drinks, but then neither was he about to turn one down. So, our Jack, he tells the devil that he must turn himself into a handful of coins to pay for the drink. But, thirsty though he was, Jack was a clever boy, and put the coins in his pocket, around his silver cross, and the devil, next to that cross, couldn\u2019t turn himself back into the devil, not next to the holy relic! Finally, though, Jack let the devil return to his old self\u2014long as he didn\u2019t bother Jack for a year and a day\u2014and would not claim his soul if he should die. There are stories of Jack playing a few other tricks on the devil over his lifetime. Eventually, of course, he did die. And when he did, the Good Lord would not let him into Heaven, and the devil could not claim his soul, and so he was sent into the dark of the night with only a burning lump of coal to light his way. Well, Jack found a pumpkin, carved it out, and carried it about endlessly through the darkness of the night. And so he was called Jack of the Lantern, and finally, Jack-o\u2019-Lantern.\u201d He paused to take a gulp.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad tradition\u2014especially for those who scoop out the pumpkin and make pie and then carve the pumpkin to burn with an eerie\u2014or happy!\u2014face throughout the night,\u201d he finished.</p><p>\u201cPumpkin pie is delightful,\u201d Jenna said, leaning toward him and touching his hand. \u201cBut I\u2019m pretty sure this story isn\u2019t why I\u2019m here, Uncle Jamie. Talk to me. Why did you want me here? I\u2019m delighted to see you, you know that. But you called me and said that you needed me.\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded, running his fingers over the varnished wood of the table. \u201cIt may be too late,\u201d he said softly. Then he looked up at her. \u201cThey think they have him dead to rights. They say that the blood of those he murdered was all over him, and that his fingerprints were on the ax. But he didn\u2019t do it, Jenna. He didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. He was talking now, but he was beginning in the middle.</p><p>\u201cYou asked me here...about the murders that occurred? But...the family was just killed last night. You called me two days ago.\u201d</p><p>Jamie shook his head. \u201cI called you about two murders that had happened earlier\u2014and then last night occurred...and now they have the boy...and I just don\u2019t believe he did it. He\u2019ll be railroaded into a mental hospital for the rest of his life\u2014but he\u2019s not crazy! People started saying that it was the house\u2014that it\u2019s Lexington House, and that he lived there and started killing because he was listening to ghosts. Thing is, I know that by what seems like obvious evidence he looks guilty as all hell, but that\u2019s only what it looks like. He didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cAll right, back up. You called me because of the two previous murders. The radio mentioned those on the way up here, too, but only bits and pieces and suppositions. I don\u2019t really know details. Tell me about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months ago, a farmer in Andover, Peter Andres, was killed in his barn\u2014with a scythe. The police had no suspects\u2014the scythe was in the barn, but there were no fingerprints other than those of Andres. Everyone was baffled. Andres was known as an affable man. But the rumor mill got started\u2014the rhyme about Lexington House doesn\u2019t tell it all. In the nineteenth century, a scythe was supposedly used on the Braden father before he was given the final blows by the ax. So, the police started looking at people with an interest in Lexington House, and then at Lexington House itself. Malachi was always the subject of some rumor or other\u2014he\u2019s a strange lad. But he tells me that he prays, and he believes deeply in God and in Heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany killers find Jesus,\u201d Jenna said softly. \u201cHow did you know all this about him?\u201d</p><p>Jamie shook his head. \u201cThey find Jesus in prison\u2014 Malachi has always had him.\u201d He sighed. \u201cThe boy came to me three years ago. His parents brought him to me\u2014they were forced to, by children\u2019s services, after a few incidents at school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what\u2014he attacked other children? Threw rocks at birds...set cats on fire?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, no. Nothing of the like. He was teased, beaten and bullied by other boys. He just sat there when they hurt him and said that God was his protector and that Jesus would turn the other cheek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon after, the parents decided to take him out of school, but because of another incident, a really strange incident. And that\u2019s when children\u2019s services ordered that he see a psychiatrist\u2014me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo how long have you been seeing him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d asked the parents? He was my patient for a year. Social services paid me for a year. But I\u2019ve seen him ever since\u2014more as a friend than a patient. It all began about three years ago, when his parents pulled him out of school. Thing was, in his own way, he was happy to come see me. Musical instruments, other than the voice, were a sin in his house. But he\u2019s something of a genius with the piano. At my house, he could play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the incident that caused social services to step in?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>\u201cHe looked at a boy,\u201d Jamie said.</p><p>\u201cLooked at him?\u201d Jenna repeated, puzzled.</p> <p>Jamie nodded. \u201cThe boy was throwing food from his lunch tray at Malachi. Malachi looked at him, and this other boy froze\u2014and then he picked up his tray and beat himself over the head with it so hard that he had a concussion. He was hysterical and told the doctors that Malachi had forced him to do it\u2014with his eyes.\u201d</p><p>Jenna leaned back, staring at Jamie, frowning. \u201cWait\u2014this other kid said that Malachi looked at him, and made him beat himself silly?\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded.</p><p>Jenna shook her head. \u201cWhy\u2014that\u2019s preposterous. Especially here. It\u2019s like the girls crying Witch! Witch! Witch! and causing the unjust deaths of twenty people and the incarceration of nearly two hundred more. I\u2019d thought we\u2019d learned some lessons...\u201d</p><p>Jamie sighed. \u201cHe was better off out of school. The thing is, I think that Malachi desperately wanted to be normal. He was malnourished, and he was raised to think that just about everything in the world was evil, an idea browbeaten into him by a fanatical father. He never lost his temper\u2014the other kids couldn\u2019t goad him to act. And that made them mad. He\u2019s the most peace-loving individual I\u2019ve ever met. When the neighbor, Earnest Covington, was killed, one of the boys who he\u2019d been with at school went to the police and told them that Malachi had come running out of the house. They brought Malachi in for questioning, but Mrs. Sedge at the grocery store, said that Malachi had been in the meat section at the time, choosing dinner cuts for his mother\u2014she never left the house\u2014so he was off the hook. But, then, last night...well, Malachi was found drenched in his family\u2019s blood, standing naked in the road.\u201d</p><p>Jenna put her hand on her uncle\u2019s. \u201cUncle Jamie, you have a friendship with this boy...but, if he was found covered in his family\u2019s blood...?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJenna, I need you to find out the truth about that house,\u201d he said with resolution. \u201cUncle Jamie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t let the system take this boy. We have to somehow make it work for him now\u2014now that he has a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis parents are gone now,\u201d Jamie said quietly. He looked toward the ceiling. \u201cGod forgive me!\u201d he murmured and crossed himself. He looked at Jenna solemnly. \u201cYou know I\u2019m a religious man, right, Jenna?\u201d</p><p>Surprised by the sudden question, she arched a brow to him. \u201cWell, you were almost a priest.... I didn\u2019t figure that meant you\u2019d turned away completely but\u2014sorry! No, I know that you still love the church.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in the way human beings interpret religion at times, and God knows I loathe the horrible things done daily in the name of God and religion. But you don\u2019t go throwing the baby out with the bathwater, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie, you\u2019re losing me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were\u2014fanatics,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know exactly what belief they adhered to, but it was with a vengeance. There was hell to pay when that boy didn\u2019t learn his Bible verses or when he couldn\u2019t recite huge tracts of the Bible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was abused?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot physically\u2014they weren\u2019t beatings, or even severe spankings. Parents often tap the hands of little ones\u2014to stop them touching a stove top, a light socket... No, the abuse was mental and, well, I do suppose physical in a way. No food could be eaten without the father\u2019s blessing....\u201d</p><p>Jamie stopped speaking for a minute.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t imagine the peace in that boy\u2019s eyes at times. He doesn\u2019t do evil things because of the ghosts in a house, and he doesn\u2019t do evil things because his father was a religious zealot who turned everything to sin. I don\u2019t believe he does evil things at all\u2014especially not murder. If ever anyone has been touched by the hand of God, I think it\u2019s that boy. And you have to help me save him. Maybe it\u2019s my mission in life, I don\u2019t really know. But I\u2019m begging you. You have to get into that house, and you have to speak with Malachi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how am I going to interfere when he\u2019s now in the hands of the police?\u201d</p><p>Jamie looked past her and lowered his voice. \u201cWell, with a wee bit of help from the Lord, I think I can convince his defense attorney that he needs your assistance.\u201d</p><p>She turned to see what had drawn Jamie\u2019s attention. It was a man, tall and broad shouldered. The coat he had worn into the bar was excellently cut, and he moved like someone accustomed to custom-tailored clothing. His face was strongly molded with a classic masculine line. His hair was neatly cut and combed, just slightly awry from the breeze. She thought that she recognized him, but she didn\u2019t know why she should have.</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cSamuel Anthony Hall, attorney-at-law.\u201d</p><p>She almost laughed aloud. She knew why she recognized him\u2014she\u2019d recently seen his name and picture all over the internet. The world had wanted his last client to fry for the heinous murder of his pregnant fianc\u00e9e. The prosecution had DNA evidence that the two had engaged in intercourse the day of the murder, but Hall had proved that one of his client\u2019s enemies had killed the woman\u2014a revenge killing. She couldn\u2019t remember the details, but the client had loose mob ties and the case had received major press attention.</p><p>\u201cActually, you\u2019ve met him before, you know,\u201d Jamie said.</p><p>\u201cI have?\u201d Jenna looked at her uncle.</p><p>\u201cYou knew his parents, Betty and Connor. They were friends of mine, and they were friends of your folks, as well. You\u2019ve been in his home. Maybe only once or twice\u2014you were here when you were a young teenager and he was home from law school. He was supposed to be watching over you and a few of your friends. Silly, giggling girls. He thought you all were torture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Can\u2019t wait to meet him again, though I think I do remember his folks. They were very nice people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were.\u201d</p><p>She studied Sam. He had the bearing of a man in charge\u2014and a fighter. Or a bulldog.</p><p>\u201cSamuel Hall,\u201d she mused, turning back to her uncle, slightly amused. \u201cThat\u2019s not the kind of attorney the state acquires when you haven\u2019t the resources to hire your own. And I\u2019m assuming all the money Malachi might have will be in probate. And unless you\u2019ve changed your ways\u2014working for the state most of the time for almost nothing\u2014you can\u2019t afford him. And even if our entire family was to put in our life savings, we still couldn\u2019t afford him. He was said to have made several hundred thousand\u2014just off his last case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he can command a high fee,\u201d Jamie murmured.</p><p>\u201cToo high,\u201d Jenna told him softly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to do it pro bono,\u201d Jamie said.</p><p>She stared at him with surprise.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cAll right, so he doesn\u2019t know it yet.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cAnd, dear niece, if you don\u2019t mind, please give him one of your best smiles and your sweetest Irish charm.\u201d</p><p>2</p><p>\u201cSam!\u201d</p><p>Sam Hall turned to see that Jamie O\u2019Neill was hailing him from one of the booths. O\u2019Neill wasn\u2019t alone. He was with a stunning young redheaded woman who had craned her neck to look at him. She was studying him intently, her forehead furrowed with a frown.</p><p>He thought at first that she was vaguely familiar, and then he remembered her.</p><p>She had changed.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t quite recall her name, but he remembered her being a guest at his house once, and that she\u2014and half a dozen other giggling girls\u2014had turned his house upside down right when he\u2019d been studying. But his mother had loved to host the neighborhood girls, not having had a daughter of her own.</p><p>Before, she had been an adolescent. Now, she had a lean, perfectly sculpted face and large, beautiful eyes. Her hair was the red of a sunset, deep and shimmering and\u2014with its swaying, long cut\u2014sensual. She appeared grave as she looked at him and, again, something stirred in his memory; maybe he\u2019d seen her somewhere\u2014or a likeness of her\u2014since she\u2019d become an adult. She was O\u2019Neill\u2019s niece, of course. And her parents, Irish-turned-Bostonian, had been friends with his folks.</p><p>\u201cSam, please! Come and join us,\u201d Jamie called.</p><p>He\u2019d ordered a scotch and soda. Drink in hand, he walked to the booth. He liked the old-timer. O\u2019Neill was a rare man. He possessed complete integrity at all costs. An immigrant, he\u2019d put himself through eight years of school to achieve his degree in psychiatry. He lived modestly in an old wooden house, and he still probably took on more patients through the pittance granted him by the state than any other person imaginable. Sam had heard a rumor that Jamie had gone through a seminary but then opted to live a life outside the Catholic church.</p><p>But when he really looked at the grave look on Jamie\u2019s face, he felt a strange tension shoot through his muscles.</p><p>Jamie wasn\u2019t calling him over just to say hello. He wanted something from him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sam wished he\u2019d never come into the bar.</p><p>\u201cSam, do you remember my niece, Jenna Duffy? Jenna, Sam, Sam Hall.\u201d</p><p>Jenna Duffy offered him a long, elegant hand. He was surprised that, when he took it, her handshake was strong.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve met, so I\u2019ve been told,\u201d she said. He found himself fascinated with her eyes. They were so green. Deep viridian, like a forest.</p><p>\u201cI have a vague memory myself,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSam, sit, please\u2014if you have the time?\u201d Jamie asked.</p><p>He was tempted to say that he had a pressing engagement. Hell, he\u2019d gone to law school and, sometimes, in a courtroom, he realized that it had almost been an education in lying like wildfire while never quite telling an untruth. It was all a complete oxymoron, really.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on a leave, aren\u2019t you? Kind of an extended leave?\u201d Jamie asked him, before he could compose some kind of half truth.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a leave, since I choose my own cases, but, yeah, I\u2019ve basically taken some time. I\u2019m just deciding what to do with my parents\u2019 home,\u201d he replied.</p><p>He slid into the seat next to Jenna Duffy. He noted her perfume\u2014it was nice, light, underlying. Subtle. It didn\u2019t bang him on the head. No, this was the kind of scent that slipped beneath your skin, and you wondered later why it was still hauntingly in the air.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to sell your parents\u2019 house, are you?\u201d Jamie sounded shocked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve considered it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey loved that place,\u201d Jamie reminded him.</p><p>Jenna was just listening to their conversation, offering no opinion.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re gone,\u201d Sam said. He shook his head. \u201cI just don\u2019t really have a chance to get up here all that often anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a thirty-minute ride,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s so wonderful and historic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is Boston,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cAh, but nothing holds a place in the annals of American\u2014and human!\u2014history as does Salem,\u201d Jamie said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to shame me, Jamie O\u2019Neill,\u201d Sam said. He smiled slowly.</p><p>Jamie waved a hand in the air. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if you need the money.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. That one hurt, just a little bit.</p><p>\u201cJamie, you didn\u2019t call me over here to give me a guilt complex about my parents\u2019 house...\u201d Sam said.</p> <p>Jamie looked hurt. \u201cYoung man\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you would have said hello\u2014you would have asked about my life. But what\u2019s going on? I know you. And that Irish charm. You\u2019re a devious bastard, really.\u201d Then he looked at Jenna and murmured, \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t disagree,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found Malachi Smith in the road last night,\u201d Jamie said quietly.</p><p>Sam tensed immediately. The incident had been disturbing on so many levels. He couldn\u2019t forget the way that the boy had been shaking.</p><p>He stared back at Jamie. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that he did it,\u201d Jamie said.</p><p>Sam winced, staring down at his drink. He rubbed his thumb over the sweat on his glass. \u201cLook, Jamie, I feel sorry for that kid. Really sorry for him. I\u2019ve been watching the news all morning. His life must have been hell. But I saw him. He was covered in blood. How else did he become covered in blood if he wasn\u2019t the one who did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, come on, you\u2019re a defense attorney!\u201d Jamie said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m missing obvious,\u201d Sam said drily. No, not really. There was just this odd feeling. Why get involved any more than he already was? The horror he\u2019d felt when he\u2019d come upon the boy bathed in blood, in the middle of the road...</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d Jenna said, \u201cthat it\u2019s possible that Malachi Smith came home to find his family butchered, and that he tried to wake them up, or perhaps wrap them in his arms, and therefore became covered in the blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was naked,\u201d Sam said flatly.</p><p>\u201cRight. He became horrified by the amount of blood all around him, all over his clothing, and tried to strip it off\u2014but there was so much of it, it was impossible,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cAnd you believe this?\u201d he asked pointedly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t grow up here\u2014I was always a visitor\u2014I never knew Malachi Smith or his family. I heard the rumors about them, and, naturally, everyone in the area knows about Lexington House. Well, it\u2019s the kind of legend that gets around everywhere, I suppose. I can\u2019t tell you about Malachi Smith\u2014not the way that Uncle Jamie can. Jamie treated the boy. But I think that\u2019s the kind of possibility my uncle might have in mind. And I myself suppose it\u2019s possible. We\u2019d have to know what Malachi has to say.\u201d</p><p>Sam stared at her for a long moment. Her eyes were enigmatic, so deep and mesmerizing a green. If he remembered correctly, she\u2019d been something of a wiseass kid.</p><p>\u201cSam, they are your roots,\u201d Jamie said.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cMy roots? Lexington House is not part of my roots\u2014I barely knew the Smiths. Again, and please, listen to me, Jamie, I understand how you feel. I\u2019m sorry for the boy. But, I don\u2019t like staying here too long\u2014you wind up tangled in the history of the place, shopping for incense, herbs and tarot cards\u2014and hating the Puritans. Religious freedom? Hell, they kicked everyone else out. Witchcraft? Spectral evidence...it\u2019s no wonder we have religious nuts like the Smiths moving in. And I like our modern Wiccans\u2014do no harm and all that. But I\u2019m not into chanting and worshipping mother earth, either. I seem to get too wrapped up when I\u2019m here\u2014I\u2019m like you. I want to argue the ridiculous legal system of the past, and I find myself wondering sometimes if it does affect any insanity that goes on in the present. Maybe it\u2019s in the air, maybe it\u2019s in the grass and maybe people just really want to hurt one another. Maybe they can\u2019t not buy into all the hype of this place.\u201d</p><p>He stopped speaking. He was surprised at his own bitterness. He had never hated Salem. It was his home. The Peabody Essex Museum was an amazing place. People still tried hard to figure out just what had gone on, and how to improve the world in the future, to learn how to stop the ugliness of prejudice and hatred. Actually, he loved Salem itself. He loved many of the people. Maybe it was just him; maybe he still wanted to understand what could never be truly comprehended in the world they lived in now. But people tried. Tried to preserve the past to improve the present and the future.</p><p>And yet a whacked-out son of a bitch like Abraham Smith had moved in, tortured his son in a like manner to the rigid principles practiced long ago, and he\u2019d never forget the way the kid had looked in the middle of the road, shaking, his eyes huge and terrified, blood drip- ping off his naked body...and he couldn\u2019t help but feel that the father\u2019s method of raising the son had something to do with all that death.</p><p>Jamie was nonplussed by his speech. Jenna just looked at him with those beautiful green eyes that seemed to rip into the soul.</p><p>He sighed deeply. \u201cYou want me to defend the boy. It should be an open-and-shut case. There\u2019s just no way that a prosecutor would ever get a jury to believe that the boy was mentally competent when he committed the act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jamie said firmly. \u201cI want you to prove that the boy didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>Sam groaned softly.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that your specialty?\u201d Jamie asked him. \u201cProving your client\u2019s innocence\u2014and in so doing, finding the real killer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie, I\u2019d like to help, but in this case\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know we don\u2019t pay as well as the mob...\u201d Jamie cut in.</p><p>\u201cOh, low blow, Jamie. Not fair. I\u2019ve worked pro bono many times.\u201d He sighed deeply. \u201cYou don\u2019t just want me to defend Malachi Smith\u2014you want me to find a killer. I haven\u2019t lived here in years\u2014I wouldn\u2019t even begin to know where to look. And I\u2019m an attorney\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep up with your private investigator\u2019s license,\u201d Jamie pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWe could be talking a conflict of interest in this situation,\u201d Sam said, \u201cif I\u2019m defending him and investigating the case.\u201d</p><p>Jamie smiled serenely. \u201cNope. It\u2019s perfectly legal for you to hold and use your P.I. license while you practice law. And you know it. That\u2019s not an excuse\u2014you\u2019ve just come off a case in which you managed to do both. Any time whatsoever you\u2019re afraid of a conflict of interest, you send someone else out. You use your mind and your license when you need them. Send others out to do the work you\u2019ve decided needs to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat others?\u201d Sam asked, aggravated.</p><p>\u201cJenna,\u201d Jamie said, smiling then like the Cheshire cat.</p><p>\u201cYour niece?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJenna,\u201d Jamie repeated. \u201cMy niece is part of a special unit of the FBI.\u201d</p><p>Sam stared at the redheaded woman at his side. FBI? Special Unit?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here officially,\u201d she said quickly.</p><p>\u201cOf course not, you\u2019d have to be invited in, and Detective John Alden is certain that he doesn\u2019t need help, that he has his murderer,\u201d Sam said, looking at her. \u201cWhat kind of a special unit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJenna\u2019s team was instrumental in solving some of the most high-profile cases in the country,\u201d Jamie said proudly. \u201cThe recent Ripper murders in New York? That was her team. And all that trouble down in Louisiana with the death of a senator\u2019s wife\u2014them again.\u201d</p><p>Sam stared at her, memories stirring in his mind. He remembered now. In the news they\u2019d been called the Krewe of Hunters, and they had a phenomenal success rate. But they were known to be...special, all right. They looked for paranormal occurrences. And what better place than Salem?</p><p>He didn\u2019t mean to be so rude; he took his eyes off Jenna when he spoke. \u201cThe ghost of old Eli Lexington caused Malachi Smith to murder his family? No, wait, he wouldn\u2019t be innocent then. The ghost killed the family himself!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIn my experience,\u201d she said evenly, \u201ca ghost has never killed anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill someone? Ghosts don\u2019t even\u2014\u201d But he cut himself short.</p><p>Ass, he told himself. She was being even-keeled. He was looking like a superior fool.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jamie, I\u2019m not sure how we can possibly solve this thing, really. The kid was covered in blood. John Alden has arrested him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Jamie said, smiling, \u201cthat should get you going! It\u2019s too easy\u2014way too easy\u2014to take that line of defense. You should step up to the plate quickly. Please, Sam! Come on\u2014they\u2019ll give him some kid fresh out of school as his public defender. Doesn\u2019t this interest you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is quite a challenge,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>Sam groaned. \u201cHow about I sleep on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidence is growing cold,\u201d Jamie told him.</p> <p>Jenna smiled suddenly, looking at him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to do it, and you know you\u2019re going to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Out of the kindness of my heart?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said. \u201cMore likely, because it is such a challenge. If you pull this off, you\u2019ll be known not just as an incredible attorney, but as a miracle worker.\u201d</p><p>Sam stood, not sure why the meeting with Jamie O\u2019Neill and his niece had seemed to set him so off balance.</p><p>Could he do it? Yes. He didn\u2019t need money. Was it an intriguing challenge? Maybe\u2014and maybe it was more likely that the kid had done it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know in the morning,\u201d he said, and walked away from the table. Then he headed back. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t think you know how much is involved here. Besides the filing, the briefs...paperwork you can\u2019t even begin to imagine. And then, yes, investigating this? When the police think that they have their man? Not to mention the fact that you don\u2019t have a plausible alternate suspect. In fact, none of us has a clue.\u201d</p> <p>For a moment he saw something in Jenna\u2019s eyes that agreed with him, and he wondered if Jamie hadn\u2019t managed to challenge his niece into this, as well. But just as quickly as the glint appeared, it vanished. Now, when she stared up at him, her eyes seemed as sharp as her tone. \u201cTwo other people were murdered and no arrests were made. With no real evidence, it\u2019s being quietly assumed that Malachi Smith murdered those other men, as well. He hasn\u2019t been charged with those murders, and I don\u2019t believe that they have a plan to charge him with them because they do have conflicting evidence where Peter Andres and Earnest Covington are concerned. So, in fact, you won\u2019t be going against the police if you are to claim to primarily be looking at those two incidents. There are plenty of places to start, Mr. Hall. Who were the other victims? What enemies might they have had? And what about the church Malachi Smith was involved with? It certainly had to be out of the ordinary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to investigate all this?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She smiled serenely. \u201cI do have friends, Mr. Hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, team members.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remind you that most of the cases we solve are at first thought to be almost impossible,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t decide what was really going on in her mind, her voice remained so even, and she maintained such an unruffled calm. He couldn\u2019t help but goad her on.</p><p>\u201cFunny\u2014I thought the NYPD had something to do with that last one!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point is, Mr. Hall, no one is asking you to do all the work. I\u2019m not a lawyer, but I do know how to work my way around legend and superstition, and the head of my team is one of the foremost behavioral scientists in the country. We can help you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the police are just going to let you snoop around?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou, as the defense attorney, will demand that leeway be given in your investigation\u2014for the benefit of your client, of course,\u201d Jenna said impatiently.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know why he was feeling such a hot tension, or why his muscles seemed to be bunching and his temper flaring.</p><p>Because he didn\u2019t think that they could do it? As much as he didn\u2019t want to think of the boy as a murderer, it seemed the most logical scenario.</p><p>He looked back at Jamie. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know in the morning,\u201d he said, and strode out of the room.</p><p>Jenna looked at her uncle long and hard after Sam had left, then finally spoke. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure that telling Sam Hall who I am and what I do was the best move you might have made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why not?\u201d Jamie asked indignantly.</p><p>\u201cSome people accept that the team gets the job done. And some people think that it\u2019s a joke. Even among the Feds,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYou can find the truth. I know that you can find who did this\u2014you always had the knack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jamie! Please, I\u2019m not a miracle worker, either.... And, you have to be ready for whatever we do find. We don\u2019t know that Malachi didn\u2019t commit the murders yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cBut, never mind that now\u2014what would you like for dinner?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNice change of pace! Scrod, of course. Only in New England can you have really wonderful scrod!\u201d</p><p>Jamie veered the conversation away from Malachi while they ate. He talked about \u201cHaunted Happenings,\u201d an October event that brought tourism to Salem. He was a man who had his own deep and binding beliefs, but he was also fascinated by the faiths that others believed in. There were Wiccans in the city who were really Wiccans, believing in the gods and goddesses of the earth and in doing no harm to others, lest it come back threefold. And, he advised her, there were Wiccans in the city who were Wiccans because it was a very nice commercial venture in \u201cWitch City.\u201d There were parades and balls, special events for children, theatrical programs on the tall ships at Derby Wharf and so much more.</p><p>\u201cNow, you don\u2019t mind staying awhile, really, do you? I rather threw you into that\u2014I mean, saying that you\u2019d investigate,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cAnd I know, too, that you\u2019re employed by the government, that you have responsibilities\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. A few team members are still in New York tying up some loose ends from our last case, and a few are in Virginia, outside of D.C., setting up our new offices.\u201d</p><p>He let out a contented sigh. \u201cSo you can stay.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cJamie, I knew from the beginning that you invited me up here for a reason. I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d arrive in time for it to really...begin in earnest.\u201d</p><p>He watched her oddly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always had it, you know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHad what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sight.\u201d</p><p>Jenna was quiet at that. Her grandmother had entertained her when she had been a child with the myths and legends of Eire. She would tell a fantastic story about banshees\u2014and then remind her that, now and again, many a tale had started at a pub. There were spirits\u2014and then again, there were spirits.</p><p>It was true. Her cousin, Liam, who had become a writer, had done so discovering that the fantastic tales he could tell after a night at the pub could be put down on paper\u2014and pay.</p><p>It was equally true that a number of people in her family had seemed to have some kind of a special sense. They could often feel a place, and know that violence had been committed there. They were prone to hearing the footsteps of the ghosties as they moved about in a place, and they could sense the presence of something that remained, even after years had gone by.</p><p>But the first time she\u2019d known she had some kind of sight was when she\u2019d been working as an R.N., and had been down in the morgue on some business.</p><p>A corpse had spoken to her. He insisted he hadn\u2019t died of natural causes, as would be assumed. He\u2019d been helped into the great hereafter by a greedy family member.</p><p>Of course, that first time, she\u2019d felt the speed of her heart escalate to dangerous levels. She wondered if, frequently, ghosts did not speak to their loved ones because they were afraid of giving them heart attacks\u2014thus prematurely making ghosts of them, as well.</p><p>And, certainly, not every soul chose to walk the earth. Some remained because they felt they had unfinished business. Some remained because of the violence of their demise. Some had something that needed to be said, and some felt that their antecedents needed protecting.</p><p>\u201cUncle Jamie,\u201d she said, moving her fish around on the plate, \u201cyou\u2019re thinking that this is going to be a far easier thing than it is.\u201d She spoke softly, looking around. \u201cPerhaps I do have what you call \u2018the sight.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t mean that I can go and see the corpse of Abraham Smith and he\u2019ll tell me who did him in. He may not have remained behind, and if he did, he may not be able to communicate. We\u2019ve never had an instance where it was easy and cut-and-dried\u2014where we just walked into a morgue and said, Hey! Who\u2019s the guilty one? Ghosts can help, but in many different ways.\u201d</p><p>He was watching her, listening intently. At least, with Jamie, she never had to try to pretend. Jamie told her once that he believed in the \u201choly ghost,\u201d and if he said so in a creed he spoke at religious services, he\u2019d be an idiot not to believe that there was more beyond the average range of sight. Faith, he told her, was belief in what couldn\u2019t be seen. If a man had faith, he couldn\u2019t always doubt what he couldn\u2019t see. Most people had faith\u2014even if their faith was different. A lot of different roads climbed the same hill.</p><p>He folded his napkin and set it on the table. \u201cJenna, I know that your team deals with what is real and tangible and out there for all to see and know. I never thought that you could come here and solve all my problems with a simple chat with the dead. It\u2019s never a simple \u2018How do you do, and can you answer a question for me?\u2019 But we are dealing with old stories and legends around here, true and enhanced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese murders aren\u2019t legends,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo. But, but the natural \u2018storytelling\u2019 desire is to automatically say that the kid did it, neat and tidy and a juicy, repeatable story. That he freaked out because his father was a browbeating fanatic and he figured he could say that the house was filled with devils. People want to say this, for the newspapers at least. See what other stories are out there, from dead men or the living. I know that you can sort it all out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou do have faith in me,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cWell, we\u2019d best get on home, huh? I have a feeling it\u2019s going to be an early morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSam Hall is going to want me to visit his client with him,\u201d Jamie said.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t agreed to defend Malachi Smith yet,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jamie grinned. \u201cFaith, lass. I live by it!\u201d he said cheerfully.</p><p>It was good to be back at Uncle Jamie\u2019s house. She\u2019d spent a lot of time coming up here as a teenager. She smiled, thinking of the past. She\u2019d had local friends\u2014girls who had been glad to see her\u2014and she brought the excitement of the big city, Boston, along with her.</p><p>They\u2019d shopped at the wonderful stores; they\u2019d played at being Wiccan, and it had surprised her at first that her Catholic parents hadn\u2019t minded. They had been amused. But they had seen the wars fought in their own country over religion and economics and were tolerant.</p> <p>Jamie\u2019s house was old, but the family had always seemed to agree that it was a benign house. Whatever ghosts remained, they were tolerant, as well.</p><p>Jenna went to sleep in the familiar old bedroom her uncle had always referred to as \u201chers.\u201d Jamie had allowed her to have her whims: there were posters of Gwen Stefani and No Doubt and other groups on the walls. They were a little incongruous there, since the bedroom was furnished entirely in period furniture, not from the seventeenth century, but the eighteenth century. Her bed was a four-poster; an old seafaring trunk sat at the foot of it, and a washstand with an antique ewer stood against the wall, along with an old wardrobe. To walk into the room\u2014other than the posters and the stuffed Disney creatures on the shelves\u2014was to walk into another time.</p><p>She lay awake a long time, what she had learned from Jamie rushing through her head. She admired her uncle and his steadfast faith; all the evidence in the world might stand against Malachi Smith, but Jamie believed in him.</p><p>When she fell asleep at last, she wasn\u2019t sure that she had done so. The room still seemed to be bathed in a gray, half light. There seemed to be movement in her room, a movement of shadows, and then they stood still at the foot of her bed, staring at her.</p><p>It was a group of women, and they were in the rather stern and drab shades of the late sixteen hundreds. Only one seemed to be in a slightly different color, and in the shadows Jenna thought it might be a dark crimson. They just stared at her, and even she, who was accustomed to meeting the dead, felt a deep unease. And then an old woman in the front lifted a hand toward her. She whispered something, and at first, Jenna couldn\u2019t make out the words. She wanted to wake up; she wanted to reach over and turn on the bedside light or just let out a scream and run into the hallway.</p><p>But then she comprehended the words the woman was trying to speak.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t let the dead have died in vain.\u201d</p><p>Her throat was still tight; she was still so afraid. And, yet, she was the one who sought out those who had died.</p><p>Words came at her again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let the blood run, don\u2019t let more blood run. Don\u2019t let your blood run.\u201d</p><p>Sam Hall arrived at Jamie\u2019s door at precisely eight in the morning. He was going to defend Malachi Smith, and he was going to do it pro bono.</p><p>Jenna decided that her uncle really did know how to read people.</p><p>By the time he arrived, Jenna had mused over her dream, her waking dream or her nightmare\u2014whatever it might have been. It had been natural, certainly. The conversation all day had been about blood and murder, and her thoughts had long lingered on Salem and the city\u2019s past.</p><p>When she opened the door, dressed and ready to go as Jamie had suggested she be, Sam didn\u2019t seem surprised, though he might have been a bit irritated that they both were confident he wouldn\u2019t back away from the case.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re coming\u2014I have to spend time at court. I have to become the attorney of record, see what the public defender has done, see where custody lies, file motions...it could be a long day,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure the public defender he hired has already made arrangements for Malachi to be seen by a courtappointed psychiatrist, and if we\u2019re going for a not-guilty plea, I have to make sure that we stall the court date as long as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m absolutely excellent at sitting around and waiting,\u201d Jenna assured him.</p><p>Jamie came to the door. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said. \u201cSam, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Sam grunted. \u201cI\u2019ll drive. You two do what I say, sit when I say sit and wait as long as you have to wait.\u201d</p><p>Jamie was cheerfully agreeable.</p><p>It was a long morning, and there was a lot of paperwork to file. Since Malachi Smith was a minor with no family and still under the age of eighteen, he had become a ward of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and there were filings to be made with the state. None of that was difficult, not, apparently, when you were a hotshot attorney. Jamie was given a hearing and appointed Malachi\u2019s guardian. Malachi had to fire the public defender he\u2019d been assigned and accept Sam Hall as his attorney. That was easily accomplished\u2014Jenna waited in the car while Jamie spoke to Malachi with Sam\u2014but then time was needed for filing all the documents Sam had prepared.</p><p>When arraigned, Malachi had not been granted bail; the crime was far too heinous. They met Evan Richardson, Sam\u2019s assistant, who had come to Salem as soon as Sam had called him and had already worked on the motions that had set the ball rolling. He would deal with more motions and more paperwork and the courts while Sam was engaged elsewhere. Jenna liked him. Just about her age, he was a pragmatic fellow from Syracuse, New York, not embroiled in the burden of history that often came with being a New Englander.</p><p>When they finished with the legal paperwork and headed back to see Malachi with all the papers properly filed, Jamie argued the point of Malachi\u2019s incarceration with Sam.</p><p>\u201cI can watch the young man day and night!\u201d he told Sam.</p><p>Sam gave him a long sideways glance. \u201cJamie, you\u2019re forgetting something,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Jamie demanded.</p><p>\u201cIf Malachi Smith didn\u2019t kill his family, a vicious killer remains at large.\u201d</p><p>Jenna felt a streak of cold zip up her spine.</p><p>\u201cSomeone who has now killed six people,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>Jamie was silent. She remembered her dream. Blood would flow....</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Jamie said gruffly.</p><p>\u201cAnd you do realize that the majority of the world will believe in Malachi\u2019s guilt. The facts point to his guilt\u2014until we can offer more facts,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>Jamie nodded. \u201cYes, I see. If the killer strikes again, that will prove that Malachi is innocent, because he\u2019ll have in indisputable alibi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That and, if we\u2019re going to do this, no one will really have the time to babysit Malachi every moment and make sure he\u2019s safe. He\u2019s better in the psych ward for now.\u201d Sam stopped in the street, staring at Jamie. \u201cAnd I have to tell you right now that if we don\u2019t discover something, and it comes to the line, I\u2019ve now taken Malachi on as my client, and under any circumstance, I will defend him to the best of my ability\u2014including changing the plea to one of insanity if I don\u2019t believe we can get reasonable doubt into the heads of the jury. You understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Jamie assured him.</p><p>Jenna did her best to stay out of the finer points of argument. She wasn\u2019t an attorney, and she knew full well that despite what she did know about federal law, she had no courtroom experience whatsoever.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see our client again,\u201d Sam said gruffly. He looked at Jenna and frowned as if he was still wondering just what she was doing there. But he didn\u2019t argue her presence.</p><p>Jenna didn\u2019t think that Sam was wrong to see to it that Malachi was kept in custody while they awaited trial. Jenna had expected something far worse\u2014a long hall with bars and cells, the stench of fear and evil, and beady-eyed reprobates staring out with a desire to slit their throats, perhaps. But though Malachi was kept in isolation in a locked room with a small window box, the room was decent enough, if sparse.</p><p>It was almost like any other hospital unit. Almost. Malachi Smith was being incarcerated pending trial on murder charges. It wasn\u2019t a pleasantly painted place, nor were there any concessions to creature comforts. Jenna was grateful for her status as an R.N.; Sam Hall used her qualifications in explaining the reason for the three-person visit when he was the attorney of note.</p><p>There was a nurses\u2019 station. There was also a guard station. The guards were armed, and there was a series of doors to enter before arriving at Malachi\u2019s \u201cdecent\u201d room. Jenna realized that the difference between his \u201croom\u201d and a cell was essentially that he had walls around him rather than bars.</p><p>The guards were professional and courteous. They seemed to be treating Malachi well. Extra chairs were brought; Malachi\u2019s space included a simple cot and one chair.</p><p>Jenna\u2019s heart immediately went out to the boy. He was pathetically slim and small for his age; she was certain that malnutrition had stunted his growth. He was a couple of inches shorter than herself, while Sam Hall and even Jamie seemed to dwarf the youth. His eyes were huge and brown, his face as lean as his frame. When he saw Jamie, he smiled. It was a smile filled with hope, but it faltered quickly and he looked at the three of them like he would begin crying in a matter of seconds.</p><p>And he did. No sooner had Malachi walked over to Jamie and leaned against him than great sobs started to rack his body. Sam stood back with Jenna, waiting for the torrent to subside.</p><p>\u201cThere, there,\u201d her uncle said, patting the boy\u2019s back. \u201cWe\u2019re here to help you, Malachi.\u201d</p><p>Sam glanced at Jenna. For the first time, it seemed that he was looking at her as if she could say something that might be helpful. Well, maybe the fact that she was a nurse and a special investigator led him to believe that she must have empathy with others.</p><p>\u201cI believe that the tears are for his family, honest tears,\u201d she whispered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd not because he was caught?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cThough, even if he had committed the murders, the realization of his family\u2019s deaths would be wrenchingly painful.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded, and seemed to accept her reply, especially with the caveat. She knew that he wasn\u2019t convinced yet\u2014no matter Jamie\u2019s passion. To press forward as if she were positive as well might alienate him, and she wanted them all playing on the same side. She wasn\u2019t Jamie. She hadn\u2019t treated Malachi, and she didn\u2019t know him.</p> <p>But she did step forward and put a hand on Malachi\u2019s trembling shoulder. \u201cMy uncle is right, Malachi. We\u2019re here to help you. But we need you to try very hard and tell us exactly what happened.\u201d</p><p>The boy\u2019s thin frame still clung to her uncle.</p><p>\u201cMalachi, we need you to help us,\u201d Jenna persisted.</p><p>Finally he nodded against Jamie\u2019s shoulder and turned to look at her. He seemed like such a little kid. She tried a gentle smile and eased his hair from his forehead. He smelled of antiseptic soap and was dressed in an orange-beige pajamalike suit that resembled scrubs.</p><p>Jail attire, of course. This was a hospital division, but it was jail, nonetheless.</p> <p>\u201cCan it help?\u201d Malachi asked quietly. \u201cYou know that, in the eyes of others, I am already condemned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, come, sit down on the bed, and we\u2019ll go through it all,\u201d Sam said. \u201cYou know that I\u2019m going to defend you. And, remember, I\u2019m your lawyer, so anything you say to me is confidential. If there is something that you want to say to me that should be kept confidential, I must speak with you alone. Now, Jamie doesn\u2019t believe that you killed your family, Malachi. And if that\u2019s true, and you want to tell us what happened, you can feel free to speak with us all here. Just remember, and this is important\u2014I can\u2019t repeat anything. Since Jamie isn\u2019t officially your doctor right now, he could be compelled to repeat what you\u2019ve said, and Jenna is Jamie\u2019s niece, and an...investigator. So if you don\u2019t wish to speak in front of them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Malachi blurted, drawing away from Jamie at last. His face was still tearstained, but he continued to speak earnestly and passionately. \u201cI would never hurt them, never! I would never hurt anyone. I believe in God, and his only son, Jesus Christ\u2014and He taught that all men should be peaceful, and seek to help their brothers. So help me, before God! I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, his words so desperate and earnest, it seemed that a ray of sun burst through the barred windows.</p><p>The room was cast into an almost unearthly glow.</p><p>Then the glow faded, and Jenna wondered if it had just been the sun passing in front of an autumn cloud.</p> <p>Malachi hung his head and repeated, \u201cI didn\u2019t do it.\u201d He looked up, straight into Jenna\u2019s eyes, and said, \u201cThou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not kill.\u201d</p><p>3</p><p>\u201cMalachi, do you remember me as the man who found you in the road?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>The boy reddened and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sit down now and relax,\u201d Jamie said, leading Malachi to the bed. He sat the youth and smiled, then took the first chair, leaving the second and closest chair, for Sam. Jenna sat on the third.</p><p>\u201cFirst, are you doing all right in here?\u201d Sam asked pleasantly.</p><p>Malachi nodded and shrugged. \u201cI know how to be alone,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Compassion filled Jenna at these words. She saw a child who lived such a strict and unusual life that he saw visions of Dante\u2019s hell at home and was shunned by other children wherever he went.</p> <p>\u201cGood, good, I think this is the best place for you right now,\u201d Sam told him. \u201cNow, Malachi, what I need you to do is really try to relax\u2014and I know how ridiculous that sounds. But I need you to go back and try very hard to remember everything that happened the evening when I found you on the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found them,\u201d he said. \u201cI found them.\u201d He started to tremble again; tears welled into his eyes. \u201cMy mother...\u201d</p><p>Jenna didn\u2019t remember getting up but she found herself crouching next to him and placing an arm around his shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she said. \u201cMalachi, it\u2019s all right to cry. You loved them. You loved your mother very much, and she\u2019s gone. It\u2019s natural that you\u2019d cry.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and leaned against her shoulder.</p><p>Sam waited patiently for a few minutes, and then pressed on.</p><p>\u201cMalachi, it\u2019s important that we know where you were when it all happened. You weren\u2019t home\u2014or were you? Were you hiding somewhere in the house?\u201d</p><p>Malachi stared across the room, his slender face crinkling into a frown of concentration. He shook his head thoughtfully, and was silent so long that Jenna thought he wouldn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cI went to the cliff\u2014the little cliff at the end of the road. It isn\u2019t a real park, but the kids go there all the time. It\u2019s like a park. Some of the kids just run around with Frisbees or soccer balls, and some of them go there to...\u201d He broke off, embarrassed, and glanced at Jenna awkwardly. \u201cYou know. They go there to fool around.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him and patted his hand. \u201cWhy do you go there, Malachi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the sea,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s up from the wharf, and you can be alone with the wind and sea and the waves crash against the rocks there. Right at the peak, you can always feel the breeze, and it feels so good. It\u2019s like it whips through you, and it makes you all clean. Sometimes, I just sit and look out on the water. And I try to imagine what it would have been like, years ago, when the great sailing ships went to sea, and the whalers and the fishermen went out.\u201d</p><p>Every kid needed a place to dream.</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cDo you go there a lot?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. He lifted his shoulders, and they fell again. \u201cI have no friends,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I know that my family was different.\u201d His family was different. In a city that made half its tourist dollars through the rather unorthodox belief in the Wiccan religion. Did people believe? Or did tourists just enjoy the edge of it all\u2014tarot cards were fun, just as it was fun and spooky to head to Gallows Hill and wonder if the spirits of the dead rose in tearful reproach or if they indeed rose to dance with the devil. But the Smiths believed in something. Not that, but something. And with belief being so cheap, in a way, that could mark them as outcasts right off.</p><p>\u201cAm I right to say that your family had very strict religious beliefs, Malachi? Almost like the Puritan fathers?\u201d Sam said.</p><p>Jenna looked at him, surprised that his thoughts were running vaguely similar to her own.</p><p>Again, his face reddened. He nodded, looking down. \u201cFather said that all the Wiccans were the same, that it was all hogwash, that there is no devil in the Wiccan belief. I don\u2019t think he really hated anyone, though. But there really was a devil\u2014he was the horned God. People just wouldn\u2019t say that he was the devil. My father didn\u2019t want to hurt anyone\u2014it isn\u2019t our place to judge on earth. He just said that they were all going to hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what you believe, Malachi,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cI believe in what Jesus said. That we should love our fellow man\u2014never hurt him.\u201d Malachi paused a minute. \u201cActually, I kind of like what the witches say. You know, that they would never hurt anyone, because whatever harm is done to another comes back on us threefold. I mean, I don\u2019t believe that there\u2019s a count\u2014that doing a bad thing to another human being means that three bad things will happen. But I do believe in a great power, and that we answer to that power\u2014to God, through Christ His son\u2014when we depart this world. And I think He will ask me if I was good to those around me, and I will say, \u2018Father, I tried my hardest. I\u2019m sure that I\u2019ve sinned, but I have tried to be a good person.\u2019\u201d</p><p>There was something so earnest about his words. They weren\u2019t like the rhetoric of many a televangelist. They were heartfelt and sincere.</p><p>He could be a fanatic, she told herself. And fanatics, no matter what their religion or calling, could be dangerous. Yes, kill in the name of God!</p><p>But it just didn\u2019t seem that he saw killing as one of his God\u2019s commandments.</p><p>\u201cI do see it all a bit differently than my father did,\u201d Malachi added, and then tears welled in his eyes again. \u201cHe believed\u2014he may have been mistaken sometimes, but he believed. He must be in Heaven now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he is,\u201d Jenna murmured. Sam stared at her. She stared back at him. It had been the right thing to say, and she knew it. It didn\u2019t matter if the man\u2019s beliefs had warped his ability to be a decent father.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened after you were on the cliff,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I came home,\u201d Malachi said. Jenna, sitting next to him, could feel him. He was trembling again, reliving the horror.</p><p>\u201cAnd exactly what did you do?\u201d Sam asked. His voice was smooth, easy. He wasn\u2019t attacking; he was asking.</p><p>\u201cI walked into the parlor,\u201d he said, his voice so soft they could barely hear him. \u201cMy\u2014my mother... She was by the hearth.... She\u2014she was on the floor. I ran to her... I fell down on my knees. I saw...the blood, but I couldn\u2019t believe that she was dead. I held her\u2014and the blood was all over me. And I couldn\u2019t bear the feel of it... I tried to get it off of me. I stood up and\u2014and then I saw my father, over by the sofa... I started screaming. I raced up the stairs and found my uncle in one bedroom, and my grandmother...my grandmother, oh, God!\u201d He cried out the last and buried his face in his hands, sobbing and wailing.</p><p>Jenna pulled him closer, murmuring soothing words. She stared at Sam as she felt Malachi\u2019s body shudder against her own.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember anything after?\u201d Sam asked him. \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d</p><p>It took a long time for Malachi to answer.</p><p>\u201cI remember Detective Alden telling me that I was under arrest, that I had killed my parents,\u201d Malachi said dully. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill them. I\u2019m not crazy, and I didn\u2019t kill them. I loved them. My parents, my grandmother...my uncle. I loved them. I didn\u2019t always agree with them. But they loved me, and I loved them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He said the words with certainty. He said the words like an innocent man. Jenna believed him.</p><p>Sam had a few more questions. She barely heard them. She sat next to Malachi Smith, trying to give him human warmth and comfort. And when it was time to go at last, she wasn\u2019t exactly sure why, but she agreed with her uncle.</p><p>Malachi Smith was not guilty.</p> <p>There was something pure about him.</p><p>She had no proof, and the evidence was against him.</p><p>But she believed in him.</p><p>When they left the facility, Sam Hall was quiet and grim.</p><p>And she realized that he, too, was experiencing the same feelings.</p> <p>Sam sat at the desk in the den at his parents\u2019 house, idly rolling a pencil in his fingers, staring at the screen of his computer and looking at the empty notepad by his side.</p><p>He\u2019d been surprised that Malachi Smith had now made an indelible impression on him.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have been so surprised, not really. From the time he had come upon the kid in the road, he\u2019d been touched by the boy. Shaken. Not shaken. Yes...disturbed, at the least.</p><p>His client was innocent. He firmly believed it, which was good\u2014he\u2019d defended men when they might have been innocent, and when they might have been guilty as all hell.</p><p>He realized that he actually felt righteous about pursuing a nonguilty plea for Malachi. This case made no sense. He liked to believe that he could read people, and he knew all the little things to look for in a liar. Liars seldom made eye contact. They were fidgety, keeping their movements close to their own bodies. They had a tendency to touch their mouths, or their faces. The emotion in their words was often just slightly off or askew\u2014acted out, rather than real.</p><p>The world was filled with very good liars, of course, but he\u2019d spent a great deal of time in court, and he\u2019d watched countless defendants, witnesses, prosecutors, judges, jurists and defense attorneys. He was good. The courtroom was actually one big stage, and often, the rest of a person\u2019s life depended on how well the ad-libbed and scripted performances were played out.</p> <p>He\u2019d been at his desk an hour now, so there should have been a list of notes on his pad. He should have been to a dozen sites on the computer. He was still staring at the screen, reliving in his mind\u2019s eye the time he had spent with Malachi Smith.</p><p>He had to shake the feeling he\u2019d experienced with Malachi.</p><p>Sam was no longer sure what he believed in himself. He supposed that he believed in a higher power, or perhaps he wanted to believe in a higher power. No one wanted to think that their loved ones, now deceased, were nothing but decaying matter. Man had always looked to the heavens for some kind of redemption and had been inventing God around the world since the human brain had begun to recognize its own extinction.</p><p>Growing up in Salem, he\u2019d seen everything. The old Puritanical values had died hard despite the enlightenment of man. Wiccans were finally allowed into a council of religions, but that council wasn\u2019t recognized by the hard-core fundamentalists. Less that .03 percent of the American population was Wiccan. In Salem, poll estimates suggested that there were about 4,000 Wiccans in an area of about 40,000. Ten percent.</p><p>He mused that today they might have been considered the \u201ctree huggers.\u201d</p><p>Had someone killed the Smith family because of their fundamentalist beliefs?</p><p>He started writing on his notepad at last.</p><p>Abraham Smith, his wife, Beth. His mother, Abigail, his brother, Thomas. Killed at Lexington House. Earnest Covington, killed the previous week, three doors down. Six months earlier, Peter Andres, killed in his barn at Andover, just a hop, skip and jump away.</p> <p>One in the barn with a scythe, one in a house with an ax, then four more in a house with an ax. It sounded like a sick game of Clue.</p><p>What did the victims have in common besides location? That was where he needed to start.</p><p>Sam rubbed his eyes. It had been a long day. He pushed away from his desk. He needed fresh air. He walked out of the house, locking it, perhaps purposely keeping his eyes downcast as he did so. He didn\u2019t want to think about how he\u2019d lost himself at that moment.</p><p>Boston had been easy. Take on the high-income clientele, fight like a tiger. When a client was guilty as all hell and sure to lose in court because of absolutely damning evidence, argue out the best possible deal. Hit the high-end restaurants and bars. Indulge in a few high-end affairs and avoid commitment. Relish a victory like his last with a trip down to the sun and sand, and then start all over again.</p><p>Shallow, he told himself.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Once on the sidewalk, he looked back at the house. And he smiled with a sense of nostalgia. He\u2019d thrown himself into his work and the lifestyle when his folks had died. Life wasn\u2019t fair; death really wasn\u2019t fair. He\u2019d loved them. They\u2019d given him everything, and they\u2019d made him want to achieve great things because he\u2019d wanted them to be proud.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d want me on this case, wouldn\u2019t you, Dad?\u201d he said softly. Once upon a time, he\u2019d been filled with righteousness. He\u2019d believed in putting away the bad guys and going to bat for the innocent and falsely accused.</p><p>Then he\u2019d gotten to see the legal system in action. He was still convinced that this country had what was certainly the best one in the world. And yet, even the best was filled with loopholes, inept cops, inept clerks and justices who were biased even if they were charged to comprehend and follow the law. Then, of course, Congress wasn\u2019t always the best at writing laws, and God knew, a good speaker was a good speaker: attorneys themselves were certainly a major part of justice\u2014and injustice.</p><p>And attorneys could become jaded. Had he let that happen?</p><p>Yes, definitely.</p><p>Maybe it was time to believe again.</p><p>Maybe that was the core of belief: people who had mattered and passed away living on in the hearts or souls of their loved ones. His father was no longer there to see him going to bat, pro bono, for the poor and ill-treated. It was something that would have pleased his parents.</p><p>He turned away from the house, surprised that he didn\u2019t want to be alone.</p><p>I know how to be alone, Malachi Smith had said.</p><p>Sam knew how to be alone, too. He\u2019d been an only child. But he\u2019d grown up surrounded by love, and his parents had welcomed other children into their home. He smiled; his mother had been concerned that he wouldn\u2019t learn how to share if she didn\u2019t make sure he learned that he just didn\u2019t get everything that he wanted.</p><p>He wondered what it had been like to be Malachi, shunned by others. And, yet, the boy seemed to have his own faith. Perhaps pounded into him by his father.</p><p>Perhaps made into something better in the lonely recesses in his mind.</p><p>Whatever demons haunted the human mind, Sam mused that everyone had them. He had his own. And he knew that right then, no matter how good he might be at it, he didn\u2019t want to be alone. And he was surprised to realize that it wasn\u2019t just Jamie he wanted to see.</p><p>It was Jenna. She was a beautiful young woman, but that wasn\u2019t it. He was lucky. His world was filled with beautiful young women. She was different.</p><p>Yeah, right. Adam Harrison\u2019s ghost-buster-Krewe-of-Hunters different. Just what the hell had he gotten himself into?</p><p>He grinned. Whatever it was, he had feeling that she was like the flame that enticed.</p><p>Jenna was surprised to see Sam Hall standing at the door to Jamie\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he returned.</p><p>She realized she was staring blankly at him. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d she said quickly. \u201cCome on in, Jamie is just hanging at the table going through papers while we\u2019re waiting on dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt,\u201d he said quickly, taking a step back. \u201cSorry, I should have realized that it was around that time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please, come on in\u2014we\u2019ve plenty. It\u2019s a strange kind of international goulash in the Crock-Pot, nothing at all exciting,\u201d she warned him.</p><p>Jenna realized that Jamie was standing behind her when he said, \u201cCome on in, Counselor! Please, we\u2019d love for you to join us.\u201d</p><p>Sam lifted a hand, as if he would back away again in a minute. \u201cSeriously,\u201d he said, and she noted that he could have a wonderful, dimpled and sheepish smile. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to interrupt. I was thinking about the case, thought I should take a walk\u2014and found that I\u2019d walked over here.\u201d</p><p>Impulsively, she stepped forward and took his arm. \u201cI insist,\u201d she said and smiled at him. Her mother could be one of the most iron-willed women she had ever met, but she always got her way by adding a grin. She was surprised that she was so insistent with Sam Hall, and she almost released his arm the second she grabbed it, but she had made her point.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just been going over notes, trying to figure out why on earth the other two victims were murdered,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll show you what I\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>Jenna turned and headed back through the hall to the kitchen. It was big, with the old hearth against the far wall. Jamie had built a fire against the autumn chill, and it felt good. Nothing was cooking over it, however; dinner was in the Crock-Pot.</p><p>\u201cWhy would anyone kill a grumpy old farmer in Andover?\u201d Jamie asked, shoving a newspaper article toward Sam as both men took a seat at the table.</p><p>\u201cSix months ago,\u201d Sam mused, taking the newspaper article. He read through it thoughtfully. He looked over at Jamie. \u201cPeter Andres. No close relatives, but he had a second cousin living in Boston. Doesn\u2019t seem like the cousin was after money. I know of the guy\u2014plastic surgeon, makes a mint. And it looks like the police did check out his alibi.\u201d He looked over at Jenna and Jamie. \u201cPeter Andres was a substitute teacher. Farmer, and substitute teacher.\u201d</p><p>Jenna set the Crock-Pot on the table and pushed the newspaper back. \u201cMake room for plates, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t suggest that Malachi killed Peter Andres because he didn\u2019t like him as a teacher!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m the defense attorney. But you can guarantee that a prosecutor will make the suggestion,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get drinks,\u201d Jamie said, hopping up. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see if Peter Andres worked as a substitute while Malachi was still in the school system.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019d bet the big bucks that he did,\u201d Sam said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re being exasperating,\u201d Jenna said, opening the refrigerator door for the salad she\u2019d tossed and setting it on the table. \u201cIt sounds as if we\u2019re trying to prove that Malachi did commit the murders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sam argued, looking at her and hiding a smile. If he were ever in trouble, he would definitely want her in his corner. She was determined and passionate in her defense. She sincerely believed in Malachi\u2019s innocence. When he was with Malachi and heard the youth speak, he believed in him, too. When he looked at the facts, he felt that belief waver.</p> <p>Jenna wasn\u2019t wavering.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen when we make it to trial is this\u2014the state will make every effort to show Malachi in a bad light. They will put forth every reason he would naturally have been the one to commit the crimes. I\u2019m debating whether or not to put Malachi on the stand, because they will try to crucify him. Then again, if he can be as convincing and articulate as he was with us, he\u2019ll be a good witness in his own defense. I don\u2019t know yet\u2014I have to look at this from every possible angle, because that\u2019s what the prosecution is going to do. One of the things I have to create is reasonable doubt, and one of the best ways to do that is to think like our opposition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr find the real killer,\u201d Jenna said, sitting opposite him and staring at him. \u201cThat\u2019s what you did in your last case. And, now, you have me. And, unofficially, an entire team of investigators.\u201d</p><p>He kept his eyes level with hers and hoped that his years as an attorney had made him a really damned good liar. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, of course.\u201d</p><p>Jenna gazed at him with cool and disdainful eyes. His acting wasn\u2019t that good. \u201cI work with people who can find the tiniest discrepancies on film, and who can find out about any piece of information possible on a computer. They will contribute legwork, phone work, paperwork\u2014anything you want. So your problem would be...?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem. I said, that\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Sam reminded her.</p><p>\u201cJenna, lass, you\u2019ve a starving man down here,\u201d Jamie said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cSmells wonderful,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cIrish-Hungarian goulash. The very best!\u201d Jamie said.</p><p>When the food was dished out and Jenna was seated, Sam said, \u201cQuite frankly, it is all a lot like acting. A good attorney can act and speak and write up summations that either prove a point, or leave a wide margin for doubt. And we also start out with the question, where do we want to go? We\u2019re going on the premise that Malachi Smith is innocent of murder, and, while they\u2019re not prosecuting the boy for the other murders, the state will have as their default assumption that the same person or persons murdered the Smiths, Peter Andres and Earnest Covington. Since they were all bloody killings committed by some kind of a sharp blade in a fairly small area, all known to the boy\u2014it seems like a plausible assumption.</p><p>\u201cSo, we want to find the person or persons who might have actually committed the murders. That will mean investigating the victims. Of course we\u2019ll be looking at the Smith murders, but if we can also cast doubt on the police\u2019s assumption about the other two, we\u2019ll go a long way to getting them to reconsider Malachi for any of the killings. We\u2019ll question friends and whatever relatives we can find, and we also need to know if they were thought of fondly in town\u2014or if they were thought of at all. The killings might have been random or specific, but I\u2019d bet on specific. That means motive, and we need to find out why someone would have killed these particular people. It might have been convenience, or there might have been a more practical reason.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI need to see the house,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Sam demanded. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of blood spatter. People were killed there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe house itself may have clues,\u201d Jenna argued.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to talk to the ghosts?\u201d he asked drily.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said evenly. \u201cSam, everything you\u2019re saying is exactly right. We do know what happened. But I need to see all the sites\u2014we have to go to Andover and see the barn where Peter Andres was killed, and also get into the neighbor\u2019s house. But we need to start with Lexington House. You know that! You\u2019re going to defend Malachi. You need to know exactly what happened. And you\u2019re friends with Detective John Alden, so...\u201d</p><p>Sam sighed. \u201cAll right. Tomorrow morning. We\u2019ll start with the house.\u201d</p><p>Lexington House. Jenna had never actually been in the old colonial building, but she had an idea of what the arrangement of rooms would be like; many such homes had been built in a similar manner. The porch led to a mudroom, and beyond that was an entry hallway. The hall stretched the length of the house, the staircase to one side. The first door to the right would lead to a parlor. Upstairs, there would be four bedrooms, two on either side of the house.</p><p>Detective John Alden led the way, ripping off the crime-scene tape and unlocking the front door for them.</p> <p>As she had expected: mudroom. Work jackets hung on hooks in the small vestibule, and work boots were lined up against the wall. There was a long hallway with doors leading off to either side of the house, and a set of stairs against the left wall that led to the rooms above. They followed John Alden to the first door on the left.</p><p>Blood remained on the walls. The spray pattern was terrifying\u2014there was so much blood. Four people, murdered here just two days ago, two of them in this room.</p><p>Two here, in the parlor. Mr. Abraham Smith and his wife.</p><p>Chalk marks on the floor designated the positions where their bodies had lain.</p><p>\u201cYou can move into the room about three feet\u2014no farther,\u201d Alden warned.</p><p>\u201cWe appreciate your assistance in being here, John,\u201d Sam told him.</p><p>Alden was still for a minute, weighing his answer. \u201cWe do have a chief of police,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the chief wants every possible effort made on this case so that there aren\u2019t any more historic mysteries floating around out there. The murders are heinous, and they\u2019re not fancy legends\u2014it\u2019s a seventeen-year-old boy who has been accused. I worked hard for this badge, it\u2019s something I\u2019ve always wanted. And I don\u2019t want any surprises when we get to court on this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoted,\u201d Sam said. \u201cAnd still appreciated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be careful where you\u2019re walking,\u201d Alden said gruffly.</p><p>Jamie took a step in to the left. Sam went to the right.</p><p>Blood. What remained of the carnage.</p><p>A table was knocked over. A pile of bloody clothing lay next to a lamp that had presumably sat upon the table. A quilt\u2014covered in blood\u2014had been ripped from the old sofa.</p><p>The bricks of the fireplace were dotted with stains and spray.</p><p>\u201cAbraham Smith got it right there, in front of the fireplace. You can see where his body lay, right there,\u201d John Alden pointed out. \u201cThe missus was over on the floor by the sofa\u2014looks like she dragged the quilt down and knocked over the table. She had hack marks on her arms. I think she stood up to protest, and was axed down right there. She staggered a few feet, and then died. And that pile there\u2014that\u2019s the kid\u2019s clothes. And this room is only the beginning,\u201d he said wearily.</p><p>Jenna could barely hear him. As he spoke, she felt as if he faded away, along with the others in the room. The very color of the air distorted, taking on a gray hue. A crude straw broom appeared by the fireplace. A wire basket of wood was on the brick apron in front of the hearth. There were no lamps. Candles sat on rough wooden tables by hardwood furniture, and sconces were attached to the walls.</p><p>There was a woman in severe, puritanical dress pacing in front of the fireplace. Once she had been pretty. Her face was worn down by weather, toil and worry. Her brow was furrowed. She kept looking toward the door.</p><p>A breeze seemed to strike Jenna from the back.</p><p>She turned. The front door had burst open\u2014two youths, one perhaps ten, another twelve, came running into the room, panicked. They rushed to their mother, hugging her one by one.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve declared against Rebecca Nurse,\u201d the older boy practically yelled. \u201cOh, Mother, it grows so frightening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather says that evil must be uprooted, and that Goody Nurse is surely evil. If the girls say that she dances with the devil, she must die!\u201d the younger boy said.</p><p>The breeze seemed to grow very chill, though it appeared that a summer sun blazed outside the gray miasma within the house. Once again, someone entered the room.</p><p>He was in breeches and boots and a white cotton shirt. His long, graying hair was parted cleanly in the middle.</p><p>He carried an ax.</p><p>Eli Lexington! Jenna thought.</p><p>He walked into the room, his hands moving on the ax as if he were testing the weight of it.</p><p>\u201cEli?\u201d his wife said softly.</p><p>\u201cEvil must die!\u201d he roared. \u201cLet those who dance with the devil go to the devil, and let their spawn rest in hell aside them!\u201d</p><p>Jenna felt as if she had been kicked in the stomach. Eli Lexington walked across the room, and despite his wife\u2019s scream of protest, he brought the ax down on her shoulders, and then, wielding it again, took it viciously down upon her fallen body. The boys stared, frozen in horror. Jenna tried to close her eyes against the vision, but the image just appeared in her mind, and there was no way to hide from the horror that unfolded before her.</p><p>Eli turned on the oldest boy.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d the child yelled to his brother.</p><p>The word was cut off as the ax struck his head.</p><p>The little one had no chance to run. \u201cThough shalt pluck out evil\u2014thou shalt not suffer a witch to live!\u201d Eli roared.</p><p>He continued to vigorously hack at his family. The last scream and moan died away. The gray air seemed to fade, and Jenna was aware that her uncle and Sam Hall were looking at her with grave concern.</p><p>She felt weak, faint, as if she would fall. She couldn\u2019t do that.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me. I need some air,\u201d she murmured. She turned and almost stumbled. Jamie, however, was already at her side, grabbing her arm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh, lass, the scent in there is a bit overwhelming. Felt me old knees buckling, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>Reaching the porch, she sank down to sit on the step. Jamie sat beside her. While he clearly wanted to be concerned for her welfare, he was also anxious to hear about what she might have experienced.</p><p>\u201cJenna...Jenna...did you see? Is he innocent?\u201d</p> <p>She looked at her uncle sadly. \u201cUncle Jamie, I saw\u2014but not the present, I\u2019m afraid. I saw Eli Lexington, and he seemed to be really crazy\u2014he believed that his wife was a witch, and that he had to kill her. And he had to kill his sons, because she had already given them to Satan, because they\u2019d wind up in hell.\u201d She realized that she was shaking, her voice tremulous.</p><p>\u201cWonderful. That\u2019s really going to help us.\u201d</p><p>The deep, mocking voice came from above and behind her. Sam Hall. He\u2019d slipped out onto the porch as well, concerned or curious.</p><p>Jenna figured it was the latter.</p><p>She stood, suddenly feeling perfectly fine. It was as if her spine had stiffened so tightly that she gained a half an inch.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me that the boy was psychologically shattered by the strict deprivation of anything societal caused by his father\u2019s strange religion, and that caused him to see apparitions in the house?\u201d Sam asked. His eyes were as flat as his words.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said equally flatly. \u201cIn my mind, Malachi didn\u2019t do it. Excuse me. If John Alden will allow it, I want to see the rest of the house. And, quite frankly, I think we should do this separately.\u201d Of course, Sam was the one who was friends with John Alden\u2014had gone to school with him\u2014not Jamie. And still, Jenna was convinced that if she acted with authority, she would be allowed her exploration. She\u2019d worked against this kind of man before.</p><p>Sam shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re here. What the hell.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, what the hell. He had written her off as a kook who liked to pretend she was a medium of some kind.</p><p>In a way, of course, it was true....</p><p>But she was part of Adam Harrison\u2019s Krewe of Hunters, and they offered so much more than Sam seemed to be able to fathom.</p> <p>Well, they dealt with that belief all the time. She had to bite down and ignore his attitude, and do what she knew she could do.</p><p>She stood up and walked back into the house. Part of the stairway was blocked by crime-scene tape; a trail of blood drops ran to the upstairs.</p><p>Jenna walked into the room where Malachi\u2019s great-uncle had been killed. The blood spatter was all over the wall. A pillow was soaked in it and had turned a hardened crimson color. She held still for a minute, but felt nothing, and no images came to her mind.</p><p>She walked across the hall to the grandmother\u2019s room. The old woman had evidently been caught standing; the blood had soared far across the room in little drops, though the majority was on the floor, in the upper portion of the chalked-out figure there.</p><p>Again, she felt nothing. She knew she had to come back. With whatever \u201cgift\u201d she had, history seemed to be coming to her slowly. She\u2019d gotten the seventeenth century today\u2014she\u2019d have to try again later to find out more recent events.</p><p>If she could...</p><p>She walked down the stairs, quiet and grim. The others were out on the porch.</p><p>\u201cI still think you\u2019re crazy,\u201d John Alden told Sam, watching Jenna as she exited the house and joined them. \u201cThe kid is\u2014weird. And, in his mind, he probably had good reason to kill his parents. Their brainwashing might have been some kind of mind-torture. And his prints were on the ax. That\u2019s going to go a long way in court, my friend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right, John,\u201d Sam said, \u201chis prints are on the ax. But, the scenario he describes could account for that. I\u2019ve seen it before. Kid came home and saw the carnage in his house. He was in shock. His parents were on the floor in a pile of blood. He picked up the ax, maybe pulled it out of his mom, threw himself on his parents. He had blood all over him\u2014he couldn\u2019t stand it. He stripped off his clothing. In shock and panic, he raced out into the night. And that\u2019s when I found him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool, you tell that to a jury, my friend,\u201d John Alden said. He cast his head to the side. \u201cCrazy, Sam, you\u2019re plum crazy. You don\u2019t need the publicity, God knows! You\u2019re high on a winning streak. In my mind, you\u2019re going to plummet\u2014like a crazy man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn, the kid needs someone,\u201d Sam told him.</p><p>John nodded. \u201cSure. Well, I\u2019m not out to crucify the boy, no matter what you might think. But I am beholden to the people here, and I have to tell you, I\u2019m glad that one is locked up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s safe,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s safe?\u201d Alden asked, and laughed. \u201cYeah, sure. Well, if that\u2019s all...?\u201d</p><p>Sam looked at Jenna, a dry smile curling his lips. \u201cJenna?\u201d</p><p>She forced a smile in return. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks again, John,\u201d Sam said. He took Jenna\u2019s arm, leading her down the porch steps. Jamie followed, and they walked across the lawn and down to the curb and Sam\u2019s car. Jenna paused, pulling back, and looked around.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Nothing,\u201d she said quietly. But it was something. They were being watched.</p><p>She could feel it; she knew it.</p><p>4</p><p>Mrs. Lila Newbury was a very thin and nervous woman who sat behind her desk looking as if she wanted to jump up and move away. She fiddled with the things on her desk\u2014a pencil, a stapler and a cup of paper clips. She seemed entirely out of place; the office had been decorated and adorned for Halloween. A carved pumpkin with a battery-powered light grinned evilly from the edge of her desk while garlands in black and orange were strewn around the windows. A paper skeleton dangled from the door, and paper images of black cats were taped here and there, along with typical autumn cornucopia. There were no witches, Sam noted, and he was sure that was because some of the school\u2019s children had to be among the ten percent of the population that was Wiccan.</p><p>Lila Newbury looked as if she had been plucked up from a sixties flower garden and thrown into it all.</p><p>Sam couldn\u2019t help but think that if this woman was the guidance counselor, many of the kids at the school would wind up like nervous terriers, running back and forth, afraid, and not even close to certain about what they wanted to do with their lives. She hadn\u2019t been there when he\u2019d gone to the high school himself. In fact, he hadn\u2019t seen any of the teachers or office personnel he had known. Sure, he had graduated fourteen years ago; people did move on. Still, there had to be someone here he still knew. He\u2019d look into that later.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Newbury?\u201d he pressed softly. She hadn\u2019t actually agreed to see him. He\u2019d walked in while one of the office girls had been trying to call and warn her that he was there.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, I\u2019m thinking, of course,\u201d she said.</p><p>Thinking, of course. She was thinking of a way to get rid of him.</p><p>\u201cWhen this comes to court...\u201d he warned vaguely.</p><p>\u201cWe have several hundred students here...I\u2019m trying to recall...Malachi Smith had been pulled out of the public system some time ago. His father\u2014God rest his soul\u2014had decided on homeschooling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I understand that was prompted by an incident at the school,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she admitted uneasily.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me what happened?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cHe looked at a boy...and the boy was convinced that he had some kind of power that could hurt him,\u201d she said, not looking at Sam, but toward the clock on the wall, as if the clock was going to save her if she just watched the seconds tick by long enough.</p><p>\u201cI need to know exactly what happened,\u201d Sam said firmly, leaning forward. He was an attorney with no power as far as law enforcement went, but he was pretty sure she didn\u2019t understand the law at all and that he could bully her. \u201cYou\u2019re in danger of obstructing justice, Mrs. Newbury. You can and will be subpoenaed, and if you commit perjury or continue to hinder an investigation into the truth, you can be prosecuted yourself.\u201d</p><p>He was glad of his reputation even though it didn\u2019t give him the power to arrest anyone. Mrs. Newbury didn\u2019t seem to know the difference.</p><p>\u201cTeachers and counselors can\u2019t be everywhere, you know!\u201d she said, suddenly angry. \u201cThe kid seemed to wear a target. Probably because he couldn\u2019t be riled. He was different, and trust me, Mr. Hall, children can be very cruel. They liked to throw food at him in the lunchroom. Well, one of the boys was throwing food at him and he turned and looked at the boy...\u201d</p><p>As she continued with the familiar evil-eye story he\u2019d heard a couple of times now, he almost couldn\u2019t wait for her to finish before he blurted out his next question: \u201cAnd you believed this?\u201d She flushed.</p><p>She had!</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. But we had to call the parents in, and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the boy was David Yates. His father is one of our city councilmen,\u201d she said weakly.</p><p>\u201cAnd he asked that Malachi Smith be expelled\u2014and someone agreed to it?\u201d Sam demanded, outraged.</p><p>Lila Newbury shook her head vehemently. \u201cNo! It never came to that. Abraham Smith stormed his way in here. He said that he wanted his son out of this horrible place. I helped him arrange for homeschooling.\u201d A pencil suddenly snapped in her fingers. \u201cLook, Mr.</p><p>Hall, I did it as much for Malachi as I did for anyone. He was a sweet boy. I liked him, personally. But this is an understaffed facility, like most public venues of education. I couldn\u2019t protect him all the time. He was going to get hurt. Like I said, children can be cruel. And, as we all know, they can be lethal, as well!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just said that Malachi was a sweet boy. Do you really believe that he could have killed anyone?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>She looked away. He thought that she didn\u2019t believe it herself.</p><p>But she was a woman without the strength of her own convictions. She\u2019d never stand up for anyone if it was contrary to public opinion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat about Peter Andres?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d she asked nervously.</p><p>\u201cHe substituted here?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cAnd at other schools!\u201d she said defensively.</p><p>\u201cYou know that Malachi is suspected of his murder?\u201d</p><p>She waved a hand in the air. \u201cRumor, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRumor\u2014of course. But rumor goes a long way. Did he ever teach Malachi Smith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, of course...he was a substitute and we often called him in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid they get along?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, and then apparently appeared to be truthful. \u201cAs a matter of fact, they got along quite well. Peter was strict, and Malachi didn\u2019t mind strict. Peter liked the boy. He said that he was \u2018special.\u2019 He didn\u2019t mean that in the mean way the other children did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever tell that to the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police never asked me.\u201d She sighed impatiently. \u201cPeter was killed over in Andover, what, about six months ago? Malachi was not one of our student body then.\u201d</p><p>Sam stood up. \u201cThe boy with whom the altercation took place\u2014David Yates? Is he still in school here? He\u2019d be...a senior, so ready to graduate next June, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said almost inaudibly.</p> <p>\u201cWell, thank you, Mrs. Newbury. You\u2019ve been a tremendous help.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, and her face appeared stricken. She hadn\u2019t wanted to help him at all. She managed a jerky nod.</p><p>He left her office, very afraid for the youth of the day.</p><p>Jenna had thought that there might be a For Sale sign on the farmhouse where Peter Andres had been murdered.</p><p>There was. And it was already showing signs of wear and tear. No matter how great a deal the property might be, many people would be loath to live at a place where a heinous murder had taken place. While they loved to stay at \u201chaunted\u201d hotels and bed-and-breakfast inns, they didn\u2019t particularly want to spend their lives in places with actual \u201cevil\u201d reputations.</p><p>Jenna put through a call to the Realtor. The woman who took her call seemed surprised by her interest in the property.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to show it to you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d Jenna said.</p> <p>\u201cI...uh...of course. I can meet you in, say, half an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. May I look over the grounds until you arrive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yes. If you wish. Look, I feel obliged to tell you that the previous owner was murdered in his barn,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Jenna hung up quickly, glad that the woman didn\u2019t press to make sure she had a serious interest in the property.</p><p>She left her car on the curb and walked toward the house itself. It was a typical New England farmhouse. There was an empty paddock to the right of the house, and overgrown fields beyond. The barn was to the left rear of the house.</p><p>She felt the breeze stir as she walked toward the barn. The day couldn\u2019t have been more beautiful. The air was crisp and cool, and autumn colors seemed to hover around the property in shades of red and gold.</p><p>The doors to the barn were wide-open; she assumed a cleanup crew had been in, and that there would be no evidence of the crime remaining. Again she was proved right. The barn was clean swept. It had a lingering odor of hay and horses, but the place was spotless. She doubted that there were even spiderwebs in the eaves.</p><p>She walked into the barn. She\u2019d had Jake Mallory perform his computer magic and get his hands on the crime-scene photos and send them through to her email, so she could close her eyes and imagine the scene. Peter Andres had died with his eyes open, a look of astonishment still on his face. His killer had used the scythe first against his throat; the victim had gripped his neck, stunned, trying to fight the flow of blood. He had gone down, and the killer had finished it all off with a few swipes to his chest. The murder hadn\u2019t taken more than a few seconds, the first strike had been so swift.</p><p>Jenna stood in the dead center of the barn and closed her eyes.</p><p>She could see Peter Andres. He had been a big man, white haired and white bearded. He had been raking autumn leaves the wind had swept into the barn.</p><p>She frowned, opening her eyes. She\u2019d had a sense of someone so strong that she had to see if it was real or not.</p><p>She was alone in the barn.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>She\u2019d felt as if there was someone there. Someone, or a something. There had been a figure in a cape and cowl\u2014and some kind of a demon mask.</p><p>Halloween. It was Halloween season.</p><p>But it hadn\u2019t been Halloween when Peter Andres had been killed. And still, she was certain that she\u2019d had a sense of such a person, looking around the barn door first, seeing Peter...</p><p>And rushing in.</p><p>The mask had been...a demon face. The figure had been dressed like a caped and cowled version of the horned demon. Satan? Malachi\u2019s father had suggested that despite the fact that the Wiccan religion had no demons, they actually did have a devil, one of their earth gods in disguise. She didn\u2019t know that much about the religion, but she knew that it was far different than the kind of imagined \u201cwitchcraft\u201d that people had been persecuted for in the past.</p><p>She closed her eyes again. There was a rush in the air around her, a rush of movement. Peter Andres had been taken entirely by surprise. A big man, he could have defended himself.</p><p>He\u2019d never had the chance.</p><p>He\u2019d looked up from his work to see the figure racing toward him. He\u2019d been confused, frowning over the evil vestige of the whirlwind hurtling into his body. He probably hadn\u2019t even noticed that the demon-thing was carrying a scythe.</p><p>She felt movement in the air. Someone was there.</p><p>She opened her eyes, backing away, instinct warning her of danger.</p><p>And ran into a little blonde woman.</p><p>\u201cMiss Duffy? I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to startle you. I\u2019m Alison Chart, the Realtor.\u201d</p><p>Councilman Andy Yates didn\u2019t give Sam any kind of a runaround.</p><p>Sam stopped in at his office on Pickering Wharf, where, when not being a councilman, Andy Yates bought and sold period furniture and collectibles.</p><p>The young secretary in the front vestibule was a man, and he apparently recognized Sam. Sam had to be more than a decade older than the fresh-faced twenty-something sitting there, so he knew he wasn\u2019t an old acquaintance.</p><p>\u201cSorry for staring, Mr. Hall. I know you from the magazines.\u201d He stood to shake Sam\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Mr. Yates that you\u2019re here. Oh, sorry, I\u2019m Greg Mason. Glad to meet you.\u201d He walked straight to the door of the inner office and tapped on it. Opening it, he announced Sam\u2019s arrival.</p><p>Andy Yates was standing when Sam entered. He was a man in his early forties, trim and in shape, with a pleasant face and a headful of sandy-brown hair. He shook Sam\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ve heard you\u2019re defending Malachi Smith. I\u2019m glad to hear it. I\u2019m sorry for that young man. He needs to be locked up, of course, but I\u2019m sorry for him. He didn\u2019t have much of a chance, living at Lexington House with that strange family of his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s generous of you, Mr. Yates,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cAndy, please. I\u2019m a man of the people\u2014or I try to be,\u201d Yates said, offering Sam a grin and a shrug. Sam could see how he made a good politician. He was self-effacing, and had slightly aging boy-next-door charm that surely stood him well. \u201cSit down, please. How can I help you here in our small town?\u201d Grinning, he returned to his swivel chair behind the desk; Sam sat in the comfortably upholstered chair in front of the desk.</p><p>Sam grinned, as well. \u201cI\u2019m from here, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019d forgotten. I\u2019m actually from Marblehead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful place, and around the corner,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>Yates nodded. \u201cListen, I\u2019m more than happy to help you\u2014I\u2019m just not sure how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d appreciate it if you could explain to me what happened between your son, David, and Malachi Smith.\u201d</p><p>Yates sighed, looking down at his folded hands. \u201cWell, I bet you know the basic story of the staring and the lunch tray and whatnot. But it\u2019s something I never understood\u2014and wanted to forget. And, of course, I was worried sick about my own boy, but furious with the whole group of his friends for teasing that poor Smith kid so mercilessly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow badly was your son hurt?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cHe spent a night in the hospital, mostly precautionary. There was no major damage done, and he did it himself. He told me that Malachi gave him the evil eye, and every one of his friends agreed, of course. But I never really knew what to think.... I love my son, of course, Mr. Hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam, since you\u2019re Andy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam,\u201d Yates said. He shook his head, as if still in bewilderment three years later. \u201cI took David to a doctor, of course. A psychiatrist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Jamie O\u2019Neill?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cJamie O\u2019Neill is the best in the area, in my opinion. But my wife didn\u2019t want any kind of a conflict of interest. We took him to a Dr. Hawkins at UMass. Hawkins told us that suggestion could make people do all kinds of things. If David believed that Malachi Smith was giving him the evil eye, it was real in his own mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t harbor any ill will toward Malachi?\u201d</p><p>Yates sniffed. \u201cThe kid? No. I blamed it on the parents. Strict\u2014and maybe they bought into those house legends or something. You know, I tried to buy the house. Old Abraham wouldn\u2019t sell. And then I tried to forget the whole lunchroom thing. I mean, there was really nothing to be done. On the council here, we\u2019re always trying to keep a good balance going between our population of traditionalists, Wiccans, atheists\u2014hell, you name it. The world moves on, you know? I thought that social services should have moved in, but apparently the Smiths didn\u2019t beat the kid, they didn\u2019t do anything illegal. They were just ridiculously strict, from what I hear. No one could help Malachi. Frankly, I\u2019m not surprised that the boy finally freaked out and lashed out on his folks.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, but you know, I assume, that the police were watching him in the cases of the farmer, Peter Andres, killed in Andover, and the neighbor, Earnest Covington, who was just killed last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Peter had been a substitute at his school, and, as far as I know, he was well enough liked. Maybe Malachi, in that crazy mind his parents created, thought that Peter was responsible for his misery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the neighbor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe he saw Malachi doing weird things, who the hell knows? Look at me\u2014I\u2019m no cop!\u201d Yates chuckled. \u201cBut, look, I believe in justice, and I don\u2019t loathe you for defending him. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ll work on an insanity plea, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do well. Trust me, I\u2019d hate to see him thrown into a hardened prison population, but when it comes to locking up the boy, I\u2019m all for it. I feel sorry for him, but I don\u2019t want him loose.\u201d</p><p>Sam decided not to tell Andy Yates that Malachi Smith claimed to be innocent.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if I talked to your son, Andy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Yates laughed softly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind\u2014but you\u2019ll have to talk to my wife. Our two kids are her life\u2014she\u2019s a veritable barracuda when it comes to them.\u201d He paused, scratching out a number on a piece of paper. \u201cYou call her\u2014I have to live with her!\u201d</p><p>Sam smiled and accepted the piece of paper. He was definitely interested in meeting the boy who had beaten himself in the head because of Malachi\u2019s evil eye.</p> <p>He exchanged a pleasant set of goodbyes with the councilman and dialed the number right after he left the office. Mrs. Yates hung up the minute he identified himself. He tried again. This time, she had a few words for him.</p><p>\u201cYou leave me alone! Don\u2019t you dare go near my son\u2014you\u2019re slime, pure slime! You think you\u2019re a hotshot, getting killers off? Well, you stay the hell away from my son. I\u2019ll have you arrested if I hear that you\u2019re within a hundred yards of him. You go to hell, Mr. Hall. You\u2019re trying to defend the devil, and you\u2019re a demon yourself for doing it! You\u2019re a crooked, money-grubbing bastard, and you will stay the hell away from my son!\u201d</p><p>Again, the phone went dead.</p><p>Sam wasn\u2019t sure if he was amused or dismayed. He decided to start at it all from a different angle. Surely, there was someone out there who wasn\u2019t entirely biased.</p><p>He hesitated, and then put in a call to Jenna Duffy.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked her.</p> <p>He thought that she hesitated a minute. \u201cI came out to see the Andres home in Andover,\u201d she said.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cAlone?\u201d He didn\u2019t know why that worried him. It was broad daylight and, according to everyone, Peter Andres\u2019s murderer was in custody.</p><p>Did he believe that himself now? He just didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cI called the Realtor,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cShe\u2019s nice. I admitted I was looking into the case\u2014on my uncle\u2019s behalf. She was okay with it after I explained. I\u2019m not sure she believes she\u2019s ever going to sell the house anyway, unless she finds someone with a really morbid curiosity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything helpful? What did you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen the house and the barn where he was killed. It\u2019s wiped clean,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking of shopping and sightseeing. Actually, there\u2019s one old friend I want to stop in on\u2014at a witchcraft shop on Essex Street. Want to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSightseeing and shopping,\u201d she said drily. \u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you there in thirty minutes. I\u2019ll text you the address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam! Sam Hall! I\u2019d heard you were here!\u201d</p><p>The words were spoken by a dark-haired young woman standing behind the counter of A Little Bit of Magic. Her pretty features were lit up, and she came walking around the sales station and threw her arms around Sam\u2019s neck and gave him a fierce hug. She pulled away quickly and gave Jenna an apologetic look. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I haven\u2019t seen this boy in a long, long time! Not since the funeral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been back since the funeral, Cecilia,\u201d Sam said. \u201cDo you remember Jenna Duffy? She\u2019s Jamie\u2019s niece. I think you two tortured my parents together years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Oh, of course! Jenna\u2014I didn\u2019t recognize you at first. How could I have missed that red hair? I didn\u2019t mean that rudely\u2014it\u2019s beautiful hair. Jenna, how are you?\u201d Cecilia asked, overly emphatically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, thank you, and honestly, Cecilia, I didn\u2019t recognize you at first, either,\u201d Jenna told her. Sam had said they were going to stop in on an old friend. She hadn\u2019t realized that it was a mutual acquaintance. Cecilia Sanderson. She was a year or two older than Jenna, but Salem hadn\u2019t been a big place, and when they were young, she\u2019d lived close to Jamie\u2014and to Sam Hall\u2019s parents\u2019 home. Naturally, the two girls had been thrown together on those occasions when Jenna visited.</p><p>Cecilia grinned. \u201cWell, I have changed a great deal. My real hair color is mousy-brown\u2014for some reason, if you run a Wiccan shop, you\u2019re more alluring with very dark hair. And black clothing, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCecilia is a Wiccan now,\u201d Sam explained.</p><p>Cecilia elbowed him. \u201cSam doesn\u2019t believe in anything. We\u2019re a recognized religion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I just question what you really believe!\u201d Sam said, not offended.</p><p>Cecilia waved a hand in the air. \u201cThis is really still a small town,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople talk, and judge. Most of the time, our \u2018traditionalists\u2019 are pretty tolerant and grateful that people love coming up here just for the Wiccan shops and curios, and so on and so on. People are more tolerant when there\u2019s money to be had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Sam said, leaning casually on the counter, \u201cyou know as well as I do that half the people who come here to open up shop are playing at being Wiccan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter Wiccan than fanatical!\u201d Cecilia said. \u201cI believe in cause no harm to others. Some fundamentalists of other religions believe in killing in the name of God, Sam.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not judging you, Cecilia. I promise. I know you\u2019re a good person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah!\u201d she said and laughed. \u201cHow do you like the shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really beautiful, so well decorated and laid out,\u201d Jenna told her. She was sincere. The windows were decorated for fall, with shimmering silk flowers and leaves, and mannequins wearing fine velvet Wiccan capes and beautiful silver jewelry. Handsome signs done in curving but legible calligraphy pointed out that herbs and jewelry were in the front, curios and books in the center section and clothing to the rear.</p><p>Cecilia smiled. \u201cI always wanted my own shop! Well, it\u2019s almost my own. Do you remember Ivy Summers?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cCould I forget?\u201d Sam asked, and rolled his eyes. \u201cShe broke my Nintendo!\u201d</p><p>Jenna laughed. \u201cI remember Ivy, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe actually own the shop together. Ivy is at home, working the computer sales, which are fantastic. We\u2019re really pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d Sam told her.</p><p>\u201cAh, well, not as great as being an attorney who shows up on the front page of the Huffington Post, CNN\u2014you name it! And now, so I hear, you\u2019re defending the Smith boy!\u201d she said, her voice curious and excited. \u201cGive! Is it true? Sam, that whole family was whacked-out crazy, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCecilia! Would you be judging others?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cNo. Yes. Well, you have to judge them. Wiccan, Judeo-Christian, whatever! The whole rest of the town thought they were all crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there are people who think you\u2019re crazy,\u201d Sam reminded her. \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t mean you. I mean all Wiccans.\u201d He smiled broadly.</p><p>She waved a hand in the air. \u201cHey, yeah, well, people are people, and we don\u2019t all get along. But that\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe enemy of my enemy is my friend!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are exasperating!\u201d Cecilia said. She looked at Jenna. \u201cSo...are you two dating now or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d Jenna said, startled and looking at Sam.</p><p>\u201cMalachi Smith was Jamie\u2019s patient at one time,\u201d Sam explained. \u201cShe\u2019s helping me, because her uncle believes in Malachi\u2019s innocence.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia seemed puzzled. \u201cBut\u2014it\u2019s all cut-and-dried, isn\u2019t it? Aren\u2019t you going to pursue an insanity plea or whatever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t really talk about that,\u201d Sam said, shifting gears. \u201cSo, you give! Any great grudges dominating the town talk these days? Any shopkeepers stolen the customers of another? What\u2019s the rumor mill like? Any idea how the local pot and meth trade are doing?\u201d</p><p>Cecilia looked at them both incredulously. \u201cWait, you think that the Smith family was murdered over drugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d Sam said. \u201cBut, hey, I thought I\u2019d throw some stuff out there, since you talk to everyone, figured you\u2019d know about town dynamics. Like, was Abraham Smith fighting with anybody?\u201d</p><p>Cecilia laughed. \u201cAnybody? How about everybody? No one liked him much, but no one bothered with him much. His wife never left the house.\u201d She frowned. \u201cOh, there was a fellow\u2014a councilman\u2014who had wanted to buy the property. I think someone else wanted to buy it, too. Wiccan gossip at the bars late at night...\u201d she explained. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not, but\u2014oh, there was something in the local paper about the councilman vying for the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouncilman Yates?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cUm, yes, I think so,\u201d Cecilia said. \u201cAnd someone else...a magician, a medium, someone like that\u2014oh, yes! Samantha Yeager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo interested parties\u2014for a house with that reputation?\u201d Jenna asked, trying to refocus Cecilia\u2019s energetic talking.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course! What a tourist attraction\u2014the only reason that they talk about it in the paper like that,\u201d Cecilia said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut they can\u2019t get rid of Peter Andres\u2019s place,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cI was just out there, and I met with the Realtor.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia shrugged, grinning broadly. \u201cThe Lexington House has a truly ghastly and grim history\u2014the farm out in Andover had one bad thing happen, even if it was pretty bad. And that\u2019s recent. People like historic ghosts much more than modern ghosts. Unless, of course, it\u2019s a modern celebrity ghost. Everyone wants to stay at that Hard Rock in Florida in the room where Anna Nicole Smith died. But no one knew Peter Andres. Oh, come on, you don\u2019t need to be a psychiatrist to notice the way that people just are!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, historically, we all know about the Lexington family, and the Braden family after them\u2014so the house was worth a good deal if you want to open a tourist attraction,\u201d Sam said.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes, of course. I think that the woman I was telling you about\u2014Samantha Yeager\u2014wanted the house for work. She\u2019s kind of a newcomer\u2014okay, she\u2019s from as far away as Plymouth\u2014but she reads tarot cards and does palm readings, sells cards, herbs and all the same stuff that we do. Yeah, yeah, I remember someone saying that she said it looks like the Lizzie Borden place, which is now like a B and B or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople would go to her rather than someone else for the ambience of the house?\u201d Jenna asked drily.</p><p>\u201cOf course! I\u2019ll bet you it will be worth a mint now. Hey, the Smith kid will be able to pay you, Sam, if they sell it,\u201d Cecilia said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing the work pro bono,\u201d Sam told her.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s kind of you, to help such a nutty kid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s universally accepted?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>They both stared at her.</p><p>\u201cUniversally, as in locally, I mean,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>Cecilia nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s like knowing about kooks anywhere you live, you know. Everybody knew that family\u2014although, usually we didn\u2019t give them all much thought. And, of course, in this area, Lexington House is legendary. Everyone thought it fitting that the Smiths lived there.\u201d She grinned. \u201cAnd, of course, in Salem, you have all the curiosity seekers who come to see what modern witches look like! It may be \u2018Witch City,\u2019 but we\u2019re still the minority. I mean, we should be the alternative people. The Smith family made us all seem part of the same fabric in a way....\u201d Cecilia was thoughtful a minute. \u201cYou know, if it weren\u2019t backward...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf what weren\u2019t backward?\u201d Sam asked quickly.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m trying to remember. My sister just started teaching at the high school, so all she knows is what others say about the past, but if I remember this correctly\u2014and you should definitely check me out, because I\u2019m just giving you hearsay or whatever\u2014but Peter Andres was vocal about Abraham Smith. He said that Smith had his own money, and that he was still collecting some kind of disability. That he was a drain on the taxpayers, was the epitome of the worst of the system\u2014stuff like that. He stood up for Malachi, but he hated Abraham. Malachi, of course, always defended his father.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did Abraham have to say about that?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>Cecilia shrugged. \u201cNothing\u2014nothing that I know about. But he wasn\u2019t the kind to have a drink and chat at the bars!\u201d she said. She smiled at them. \u201cA lot of the merchants around here are actually good friends, and if we don\u2019t like each other\u2014or don\u2019t always share the same philosophy or vision\u2014we still support one another. We get together to plan Halloween activities, we work with the city and the museums. That\u2019s how we stay afloat through the cold, icy winter when tourism isn\u2019t so plentiful! So, yes, of course, we chat when we stop at the brewery or one of the bars, and we usually do hear what\u2019s going on around town. You know back when that incident happened at the high school, some argued that Andy and Cindy Yates had a crazy kid themselves, and even some smart people said that suggestion could cause people to do very strange things. Kind of like you can brainwash yourself. Then, the other half of the people argued on the superstitious side. There was something strange about Malachi Smith. Maybe the devil actually lived up at Lexington House and had gotten into him. But, anyway, old Abraham took his son out of school without a word, and people stopped talking about it so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil Peter Andres was murdered?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>Cecilia hesitated. A group had just walked into the shop. The three women were wearing beautiful velvet capes, and Jenna had the feeling that they\u2019d just been purchased. One of the men was dressed in similar fashion, but his hooded cape was brown wool.</p><p>\u201cA mortar and pestle, Johnny!\u201d one of the women said. \u201cOoh, in marble, how pretty\u2014I bet I could cook up some spells with that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Cecilia said, and walked over to the group.</p><p>Jenna could see that the newcomers seemed both fascinated and amused by the fact that they were in \u201cWitch City.\u201d She could also see that Cecilia was accustomed to the attitude and seemed entirely unperturbed. She suggested to the woman that the mortar and pestle were also quite useful for crushing garlic and herbs.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good kid,\u201d Sam said softly.</p> <p>\u201cAnd a talker...but a lot of help,\u201d she replied. She couldn\u2019t help watching the man in the brown cape. There was really nothing out of the ordinary about him; people were dressed up all around the city. But his outfit reminded her of her vision\u2014the caped, hooded and masked person who had rushed in on Peter Andres, felling him where he stood.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Sam asked her.</p><p>She shook her head. She wasn\u2019t ready to tell him what she\u2019d seen. He\u2019d mocked her at the Lexington House, and she could only imagine what he would have to say if she told him a dressed-up and horned demon had killed Peter Andres.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Halloween. People like to play at being many things,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cPeople always like to play at being many things,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019ll let Cecilia know we\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia excused herself to her customers, hugged Sam and waved to Jenna, and the two left her shop. They walked along the pedestrian street by the museums and other shops. All around them, they could hear the delighted squeals of children as they watched jugglers or paused at various stations to take part in drawing, pumpkin carving or face painting.</p><p>Jenna wasn\u2019t sure where they were going, but Sam was thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cAssuming Malachi is innocent, what\u2019s going on is calculated,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst murder a teacher, assuming that everyone would think that Malachi hated that teacher and would easily be suspected\u2014which he was. And then a neighbor. But why the neighbor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to Cecilia, everyone hated the Smith family,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cSo, we can assume that the neighbor hated them a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it all looks like a series of events, with the killer, Malachi, having lost all hold on reality, and perhaps killing others before lashing out at his restrictive family. The question is...was there a real reason for the neighbor and the teacher, or were they just there, random victims in a plan against the family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr was there a plan, and they fit right into it?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, the fact that Malachi and Peter Andres actually got on well together will help our case,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>Jenna heard him speak, but she didn\u2019t reply. She stopped walking.</p><p>Just ahead of them, moving through the crowd, was someone in a long brown cape, a monk\u2019s cape with a hood. She couldn\u2019t see the person\u2019s face and she didn\u2019t know if it was a man or a woman\u2014or if they wore a mask or not.</p><p>She reminded herself that she had just seen a man in Cecilia\u2019s shop in such a cape.</p><p>It was Halloween season, Haunted Happenings. People would be in costumes daily, participating in all the events, and dressing up because it was fun to dress up!</p><p>The person paused\u2014almost as if they had felt they were being watched.</p><p>He or she turned and looked back.</p><p>Jenna froze.</p><p>The person was wearing the mask.</p><p>The same mask she had seen in her vision of the murder of Peter Andres.</p><p>It was the horned devil.</p><p>5</p><p>The horned devil stared at her a long moment, and then turned.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have begun to explain how, but the person in the costume knew she had recognized him.</p><p>If it was a him. It was impossible to tell.</p><p>Jenna found herself following the horned devil. Even as she quickened her pace, she wondered what she would say if she caught up with them.</p><p>Excuse me, but in my mind\u2019s eye, I saw you murder Peter Andres, or at least, I saw someone in the costume you\u2019re wearing....</p><p>\u201cHey, where are you going?\u201d Sam called. She hadn\u2019t realized that she\u2019d been walking so quickly until Sam had caught up with her. By the time she looked up from where Sam\u2019s arm was on her, she saw that she\u2019d lost her target in the crowd. The horned devil had disappeared by diving through a group dressed as plums and apples and the rest of the Fruit of the Loom underwear set.</p><p>Halloween season. The season of the witch, so many thought. And in legend, the night when souls could return to earth....</p><p>And try to linger on.</p><p>But the dead weren\u2019t really returning; the living created evil.</p><p>\u201cJenna!\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2014I thought I saw an old friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone I might know?\u201d</p><p>Jenna dead-blanked on the name of anyone she might have known in Salem.</p><p>\u201cJust\u2014just a girl I saw now and then. She might have been friends with Cecilia, too. I actually can\u2019t remember her name.\u201d Jenna tried not to blink, fidget, look downward or to the side, or do any of the things that automatically identified you as a liar.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, looking back at her. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t help you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing to worry about,\u201d she said and shrugged. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jenna realized that in her pursuit she had turned down the street toward Old Burying Point Cemetery. The cemetery contained the graves of a Mayflower Pilgrim, and John Hathorne, one of the witchcraft trial judges. Nathaniel Hawthorne had added the \u201cw\u201d to his family\u2019s name, and written many of his works, because he\u2019d been disturbed by his ancestor\u2019s involvement in the trials. Jenna mused that it was an interesting place, and she was grateful for the historic preservation there and for the monument of benches and names that had been added just outside the gates for the tercentennial of the trial in 1992.</p><p>It was a place steeped in history and the past. A place where the dead had been interred for hundreds of years. Though tourists walked among the gravestones and sought out those of the greatest interest, Jenna could still see the hazy images of a few of the departed wandering about. Most spirits did not remain to haunt burial grounds; their business was seldom at the place where their earthly remains had been interred. Perhaps those who came just did so out of respect to others. The cemetery wasn\u2019t crowded, but she could see a man in a ship captain\u2019s jacket, a few in more puritanical dress, and a beautiful young woman in a gown that belonged in the early eighteen hundreds.</p><p>\u201cAh, the old burying ground,\u201d Sam said.</p> <p>\u201cI doubt if we\u2019ll find any answers here,\u201d Jenna said, turning away from graveyard itself to look at him, hoping she gave away nothing of what she saw.</p><p>\u201cYou never know. The past can usually teach us a lot. I always find people amazing\u2014and the trials extremely interesting, as far as the legal process of the time went,\u201d Sam mused. \u201cThose who admitted to witchcraft\u2014dancing with the devil, whatever!\u2014managed to save their lives. Those who denied it to the end, certain in their belief in God or just determined that they wouldn\u2019t admit to such ridiculousness, were the ones who were hanged. Or, in the case of Giles Corey, pressed to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve always wondered how people managed to stay fast to such a declaration. I wonder about myself. If I believed I could be forgiven and redeemed by stating a lie\u2014and I knew that I\u2019d wind up being hanged if I told the truth\u2014I\u2019m not sure I would have stayed the truth course. But our standards have changed. We know the world is filled with beliefs, and we have to be tolerant of them now. I\u2019m convinced that God would forgive anyone such a lie to save themselves, since their accusers were obviously so sadly mistaken in the law, religion\u2014and witchcraft!\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>She found herself sitting on one of the cantilevered benches, looking at the trees that seemed to whisper softly in the autumn air. She had chosen the bench that was inscribed to John Proctor.</p><p>Sam smiled, setting a foot on the bench and leaning toward her on his knee. \u201cHow wonderfully logical, Miss Duffy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you mocking me again?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, serious despite the charming curve of his rueful smile. \u201cI often wonder myself how people could adhere to principle with such determination in the face of such horrible consequences. Take old John Proctor. He argued that, \u2018the girls will make devils of us all!\u2019 He gave his girl a good whack\u2014hardly accepted these days, of course\u2014and her fits stopped. She got back with the other girls, and her fits started up again, and John Proctor wound up being hanged because the girls accused him. We can never, ever forget the power of belief and the human mind!\u201d</p><p>Then he looked around wistfully at the various graves. \u201cWell, you\u2019re good at lying,\u201d he said suddenly, catching Jenna off guard.</p><p>Startled, she stared up at him.</p><p>\u201cOr, not so good...\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know exactly what I\u2019m talking about. Who were you just chasing?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cIf I told you, you\u2019d make fun of me,\u201d she said defensively.</p><p>\u201cTry me\u2014since I know you\u2019re lying anyway, and I\u2019d rather you tell a truth that I might mock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t particularly enjoy being mocked,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMy mind isn\u2019t that closed\u2014there\u2019s a door in there that\u2019s slightly ajar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right\u2014I went to the murder site. The barn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sometimes have what they call retro-cognition or postcognition,\u201d Jenna told him.</p> <p>\u201cYou see the past.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, honestly, I\u2019m not. I have to admit, I\u2019m not sure that anyone really sees the past, but I believe that the mind is amazing, and perhaps such things as postcognition, as you say, exist because of something locked in the deep subconscious. You know an area, you\u2019ve seen things, you\u2019ve heard things...they come alive in the back of the mind,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, in the back of my mind, I saw the killer go after Peter Andres.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her a moment, then shrugged his shoulders and lifted his hands. \u201cWell, let\u2019s hope you\u2019re right. If we know who, we just have to find proof and motive to back it up. You know, evidence. So who was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you saw them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever killed Andres did so in costume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn costume?\u201d he asked, staring at her blankly. \u201cLike in a Halloween costume? It wasn\u2019t the Halloween season when Peter Andres was killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...what kind of a costume? I hear clown costumes are great\u2014in horror movies, at least. There there\u2019s always your traditional white plastic mask \u00e0 la the Friday the 13th movies. Or a rubber Freddy Krueger\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stood up. \u201cYou may be the attorney. Well, then, you have all kinds of legal research and studying to do, motions to file, arguments to plan. You know the law, Sam. I\u2019m not so sure that you know people, or really understand much about the human soul. I think I\u2019m better off on my own.\u201d She turned to leave, saying over her shoulder, \u201cI\u2019ll call you when I have something tangible.\u201d</p><p>She walked away, thinking that he would call her back, that he would apologize.</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>Sam watched Jenna go, feeling a growing sense of irritation\u2014battled by a longing to rush after her.</p><p>He steeled himself to hold still. Somehow, her crazy-good uncle had convinced him to take on the defense of a youth who had been caught with the blood of the slain all over him. Somehow, he had gotten himself into this. Jamie had always been happy to tell a tale about the gnomes, pixies, leprechauns and banshees, and how a battle of giants had created great stone steps in Ireland. His stories were fun\u2014good drinking fare in a pub, sure to entertain.</p><p>But, now, his niece, FBI special agent, was telling him she could see what had happened in the past. Except that she couldn\u2019t actually see who had murdered the Smiths, Peter Andres or Earnest Covington. Nope, nope, just someone in costume.</p><p>A brilliant red leaf drifted down on the stone slab seat where Jenna had been sitting. He read the writing engraved there: John Proctor, hanged, August 19, 1692. Arthur Miller, in The Crucible, had cast the man in his early thirties, a romantic fellow who had engaged in an affair with his chief accuser, Abigail Williams\u2014who had, in truth, been eleven at the time. There had been no affair, and the girl who had cried out first against the family had been Ann Putnam, and she had accused Elizabeth, his wife.</p><p>Sam\u2019s lips tightened grimly. Growing up in Salem, it had been impossible to miss learning about the Witch Trials, backward and forward. And also the Hollywood versions of them.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live,\u2019 Exodus, 22:18,\u201d he murmured aloud. Witches\u2014those who had made pacts with the devil\u2014did not exist. Wiccans didn\u2019t even believe in the devil of the New England forefathers, no matter what those like the Smiths had thought.</p><p>Jenna might well have been hanged as a witch\u2014in the colonies. Burned if she had stumbled back to Scotland or the European continent.</p><p>Sam got up and wandered in through the gate, and over to the Hathorne grave. He wondered if the remains of the man who had been instrumental in the persecution were even vaguely in the spot anymore\u2014the earth shifted over the years. Embalming hadn\u2019t existed here when Hathorne had died, and coffins were not made to try to stave off time. The thing of it all was that history was the greatest teacher. Nathaniel Hawthorne had been so disturbed by his family\u2019s part in the hysteria that he\u2019d found a way to try to right the wrongs of the past on paper, not just in works such as The Scarlet Letter or The House of the Seven Gables, but in his short stories, such as \u201cYoung Goodman Brown,\u201d in which the protagonist was late getting into the woods because of his wife, Faith, who held him back before he entered the realm in which an old man, n\u00e9e the devil, informed him he had many friends in New England. Fear so overcame Goodman Brown that he \u201clost Faith.\u201d It was far too easy to believe in the evil that might be around than it was to fight against it.</p><p>The autumn breeze was rustling, and he looked around at the beauty of the leaves. He loved New England. It was home. And New Englanders, who usually accepted all their history with a grain of salt, were truly no different than people anywhere. Especially in the twenty-first century. The pace of living was frantic; the internet brought the escapades of the world closer and closer together. And people everywhere had a tendency to be influenced by the crowd around them.</p><p>Well, back in the seventeenth century, sane men were led to believe in \u201cspectral\u201d evidence. A witch\u2019s evil soul could leave her body and squeeze the bowels of the afflicted, pinch and scratch them. And while the modern world scoffed and laughed at such a possibility, people were still fascinated by out-of-body, near-death experiences.</p><p>And Jenna Duffy could close her eyes and see the past....</p><p>None of it mattered, he told himself. He was dealing with flesh and blood\u2014literally. Malachi Smith had been found covered in the blood of his family.</p><p>That was evidence\u2014hard evidence. That was the stuff he had to deal with, no esoteric comparisons of human nature over the centuries. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sam himself had been the first to see Malachi that night. And hadn\u2019t he at first refused to acknowledge that it was blood the boy was covered in? His first impression\u2014his unconscious\u2014couldn\u2019t even be brought to think the boy a killer.</p><p>He imagined the questions he would ask if he\u2019d put himself on the stand. Nothing in his testimony\u2014sworn under oath\u2014could possibly testify to Malachi\u2019s innocence. John Alden had found the bodies of Malachi\u2019s family; he had seen the house and the pile of Malachi\u2019s clothing.</p><p>Everything pointed to Malachi. So the trick was to find someone else who hated the boy\u2019s father, a case of reasonable doubt. Of course, it wasn\u2019t going to be hard to find someone like that; everyone had hated Abraham Smith.</p> <p>Except, perhaps, for the old believers who had met in Beverly, at the Old Meeting House.</p><p>Sam turned and started walking toward his car. He called his assistant, Evan Richardson, back at his offices in Boston, and asked him to do research on any legal actions against the church.</p><p>It was time to head out to see the elders.</p><p>Jenna walked back through the crowd of Halloween locals and visitors\u2014always entertaining. In Salem, some were in business attire, some were in the more day-to-day Gothic attire chosen by many of the modern Wiccans and some were in costumes of all varieties. A giant Count Chocula was walking around with a Barbie doll. A fantastic and perfectly realistic vampire was strolling the streets with two little Toy Story 3 characters.</p><p>It was fun to walk Salem\u2019s streets. She loved the city, especially during Haunted Happenings.</p> <p>All she had to do now was forget that her uncle was probably giving himself an ulcer regarding Malachi Smith\u2019s innocence, and that Sam Hall was a major-league ass.</p><p>She tried to remind herself that she and her group were often greeted that way. People found it hard to believe that other people had talents they did not, though she wasn\u2019t sure why. Jake Mallory, their computer expert, played a mean guitar, and she couldn\u2019t play to save her life. She saw ghosts. Not everyone did.</p><p>It was often difficult to believe in what couldn\u2019t be seen. And, sometimes, it was too easy to believe in it. The \u201cwitches\u201d of Salem had been prosecuted and condemned because of \u201cspectral\u201d evidence. The people of the time had believed that their friends could leave their bodies\u2014even when they were jailed and in chains!\u2014to pinch and torment others. Sometimes, belief could cause irreparable harm; sometimes, it was impossible to summon any at all.</p><p>Which was better?</p><p>Sam Hall was no worse than many other doubters they had come to know.</p><p>Yes, he was.</p> <p>He should be getting to know her, if only a bit. There were times when they looked at each other that she was fascinated with him physically, when the light in his eyes made her think that he\u2019d just reach out and touch her....</p><p>Frankly, that she could just about fall into his arms and explore his...mind. In all honesty, she liked his mind. He was definitely walking around with a few extra chips on his shoulders, but the concept of a pro bono case had come easily to him.</p><p>She might have been wrong to walk away in a huff. No, it had been a dignified retreat. Okay, at least a dignified huff.</p><p>She paused, wondering where Sam might be headed at that moment. She didn\u2019t want to bump into him just yet. Up until now, she\u2019d been out to see the site where Peter Andres had been killed, and she was certain that her postcognition had given her a good first step. Whoever had killed Peter Andres had done so in costume, playing on the area\u2019s past fear of the devil as a horned demon. That made her think that the murderer was local; of course, someone could have come here and played off the past, but since the murders had been so brutal without being ritualistic, she didn\u2019t think that they were random or serial-killerish. The first two had been committed to make people believe that Malachi Smith was crazy and capable of murder; only the testimony of the grocery clerk had kept the boy from arrest.</p><p>She found a little caf\u00e9 just off Essex, sat down and ordered coffee.</p><p>Once she\u2019d been served, she put through a call to Jake Mallory. When he began to barrage her with questions, she promised that she would call Jackson, their team head, with a full report soon\u2014even though the team wasn\u2019t officially on this case.</p><p>\u201cJake, I just need some information right now. Can you help me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at my keyboard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA Mr. Earnest Covington of Salem was murdered last week. Some kids said that they saw Malachi running from the house. A grocer said that was impossible unless Malachi could astral-project, since he\u2019d been in the store buying meat at the time. I need the names of the grocer and the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam doesn\u2019t have that information on hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam is... Sam isn\u2019t into ghost investigations,\u201d she said tightly.</p><p>\u201cMost people do mock what they don\u2019t understand\u2014especially when we\u2019re all taught to be brave, that ghosts don\u2019t exist and there\u2019s nothing hiding under the bed,\u201d Jake reminded her.</p><p>\u201cWill you just get me the information?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cCall you right back,\u201d Jake said. \u201cAnd be careful up there, young woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m from Massachusetts,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re from Ireland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d she said, and laughed. \u201cBut the Commonwealth became my home. I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better give Jackson a call soon,\u201d Jake warned her. \u201cHe tends to read the papers, you know, and he knows you\u2019re up there with your uncle, and he knows you went because Jamie asked you to, so when he starts reading about everything that\u2019s going on there right now\u2014and Jamie\u2019s name winds up in the papers since he\u2019s the kid\u2019s guardian\u2014he\u2019s not going to be happy that you haven\u2019t yet spoken to him about the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call him now,\u201d she promised. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t official. It can\u2019t be official.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. So, if you want to be able to get in there and see what you can find out, remember to play nice and disappear when you need to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d she promised. \u201cI\u2019ll call boss man right now, while you\u2019re looking up the stories in the newspaper and wherever else you find your computer information for me.\u201d</p><p>When they hung up, Jenna realized that she\u2019d been wandering down toward the museum. She applauded the Peabody Essex museum\u2014the area was given a complete history there. Pirates had ranged the coast here, too; whalers had gone to sea. Pilgrims had fought off the Indians, and Massachusetts had given the country Thanksgiving Day. It wasn\u2019t all witches!</p><p>But, equally, what had happened here had helped change the future of a country. While there had been a time when superstition had reigned over the rich, the poor, the noble and the castoffs of society, the tragedy of the executions here in line with the \u201clegal\u201d system that convicted its victims might have been the beginning of the end for judgment without due process, heralding a true legal system in which a jury would decide on the facts, and not on hearsay or passionate words. Had there been malice involved? Surely, though many of the people had not been aware of it. It was far easier to see evil in someone if you believed that they had wronged you. But then, at the time of the Salem witchcraft trials, much worse had gone on elsewhere in the \u201ccivilized\u201d Western worlds. Thousands had been burned in a day in Germany. The Native Americans hadn\u2019t even known that such a creature as Satan existed, but the Pilgrims\u2019 fear of Indian attack had certainly fueled their belief in that evil. It had been a hard world, and it was easy to blame cultural differences, death, starvation and other ill fortune on the devil.</p><p>And, of course, those who consorted with him.</p><p>She put through a call to Jackson Crow just as she had promised. Jackson listened gravely, assuring her that, at the moment, nothing big was going on; he was still in NYC and a few people were just settling into their new field offices in Arlington, Virginia, but could help her out in their limited background capacity. The Krewe of Hunters would always have her back.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jackson,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cFor now, I\u2019m just a niece visiting her uncle and serving as an \u2018amateur\u2019 assistant to the defense attorney, who does have the right to question the prosecution\u2019s case and witnesses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we can always come up to enjoy Haunted Happenings. You know, if you just want to \u2018show us around,\u2019\u201d Jackson told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought of that,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cKeep me posted.\u201d</p><p>When they hung up, she drummed her fingers on the table, impatiently waiting for Jake to call her back. He did so quickly\u2014before she had to ask for a second refill to keep her seat.</p><p>\u201cThe grocer, Milton Sedge, works at a local market, Sedge\u2019s\u2014do you know it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thanks, it\u2019s near the Lexington house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe works from about six in the morning until closing, every day, according to the woman who answered the phone when I called. He closes at around nine. Hard worker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, he comes from good Puritan stock,\u201d Jenna said casually. \u201cDid you say that I was coming by to talk with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mentioned that someone assisting in Smith\u2019s defense would be by\u2014I didn\u2019t give your name. She was sure that Mr. Sedge would be happy to see you. I think it\u2019s going to be dicier to talk to the boys who claimed he was seen at the cliff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne was Joshua Abbott. Have you heard of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other is a kid named David Yates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the kid who believed that Malachi Smith gave him the evil eye,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cHis father is Andy Yates, a councilman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck, kid,\u201d Jake said. \u201cAnd, hey, be careful up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople here are really good people, Jake.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOh, Jenna, no doubt. But it doesn\u2019t matter where you are\u2014people come in good, and in bad. You\u2019re trying to prove that Malachi Smith didn\u2019t commit horrible murders. If he didn\u2019t, someone else very violent did. Be careful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAlways, Jake,\u201d she promised him.</p><p>Jenna hung up, walked back to her uncle\u2019s and got into her car. She was off to talk to Milton Sedge. While she was talking to him, she just might be able to figure out a way to get to the boys who claimed to have seen Malachi after Earnest Covington was murdered. She grinned at herself. She hadn\u2019t met them yet, but she was sure they were pretentious little liars.</p><p>People judged so easily!</p> <p>The Old Meeting House was a whitewashed building a little ways down the highway.</p><p>Sam estimated that it held a couple hundred people, tops, during meetings. There were no crosses or other symbols on the outside of the structure, and a carved wooden sign announced simply, Worship With Us. All Are Welcome.</p><p>He opened a picket fence to follow the brick walk to the front door. There was nothing ornate about the columns of the single-story structure. When he opened the door, he saw that there was simply a podium at the end, with a red runner leading to it. The pews were simple hardwood, and the kneelers were wooden as well, with no cushioning.</p><p>The room was shadowed in darkness, the plain, paneled windows allowing just a few streaks of light into the simple space. Sam thought that he had entered into an empty building at first, but as he stood near the entry, blinking against the murky shadows, he heard a voice.</p><p>\u201cHello, and welcome.\u201d</p> <p>A tall man with long gray hair, his face covered in a long beard and mustache, walked toward him. He was clad simply in a white dress shirt and ill-fitting black suit; his arms were too long for his sleeves and the pants were short.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do,\u201d Sam said, offering his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Sam Hall, attorney, and I\u2019m defending Malachi Smith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d the man said, looking at him gravely. \u201cI\u2019m Goodman Wilson, pastor and elder of our little congregation. How can I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, frankly, I wanted to know what you thought about the whole situation. You must be aware that many people believe that your religion is unorthodox. Do you think that Abraham Smith was so strict that his son\u2014aware of other choices in society\u2014might have thought that he was too strict?\u201d</p><p>Sam was blunt and to the point on purpose: he wanted to see Goodman Wilson\u2019s immediate reaction to such questions. He had half suspected that the pastor would immediately be on the defensive and show him the door.</p><p>He did not.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not quite as fanatic as many believe,\u201d Wilson told him. He smiled. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe in idols of any kind, and nor do we drink, swear, gamble or imbibe drugs. Actually, we have a number of ex-addicts in our fold, those who need guidance to stay on the straight and narrow. We welcome them, we welcome all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Abraham was a hard man, or have I been misinformed?\u201d Sam pressed.</p><p>\u201cSit down, sit down,\u201d Wilson offered. \u201cOur chairs are hard, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hard chair is fine by me.\u201d</p><p>They sat together on the rear hard pew, staring up toward the simple podium.</p><p>\u201cThank you for your help,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>Wilson gave a somewhat pained smile. \u201cWe do believe in justice. Not vengeance, justice. I knew Abraham Smith, of course. I knew the family, and I knew Malachi. The boy is quite amazing, really. He has a deep and fundamental belief in God. But he wasn\u2019t among our fold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have music,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cNo music, no dancing. Our faith is really simple\u2014God requires that we appreciate what he has given us. The earth, the sky, the air we breathe. We work, because society demands that we pay for our living\u2014and that we all pay taxes too, right?\u201d</p><p>Sam smiled. Wilson seemed to think his words very entertaining.</p><p>\u201cJesus believed in simplicity. He didn\u2019t need ornate clothing, and he didn\u2019t need a mansion. He taught us to love one another. He didn\u2019t sing to the masses\u2014he spoke to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Malachi needed music?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>The pastor nodded gravely. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t help you if you need me to testify that the boy might have been crazy. He wasn\u2019t crazy. He was honest\u2014he had been taught not to lie. He came to me, though he did so in confidence, and he told me that he couldn\u2019t see anything evil in the piano, and therefore, he had to leave our fold. I suggested that he think about it long and hard. I disagreed with his decision, but his deliberations were honest, thoughtful, competent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left the church because of the piano? Because of music?\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cThat surprises you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have thought that it might be something more...\u201d</p><p>Goodman Wilson laughed. \u201cYou thought we might be slaughtering goats or chickens, and the boy was appalled by blood? No. Malachi told me he couldn\u2019t comprehend a faith that didn\u2019t see God\u2019s beauty in music, and I explained the very basic nature of our beliefs. Malachi told me that he was sorry\u2014he saw God in music. Do you have any religion in your life, Mr. Hall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe in God, Pastor. But I don\u2019t know who among us really knows what he wants,\u201d Sam said. After what seemed to him like a respectful pause, he continued on. \u201cDid Malachi ever offer any violence toward his family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. In our congregation, children honor their parents. They pray, they reflect. They take the time to care for the elderly. They don\u2019t steal, and they don\u2019t fornicate. There is no bodily punishment that we offer them\u2014just excommunication, if it comes to that. We are a family here, and that is a terrible punishment when you love your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did Abraham discipline Malachi? As a good church member, he was said to beat him for infractions, but did he?\u201d</p><p>Goodman Wilson was quiet for a minute. Then he said, \u201cI worried, sometimes. Not that Malachi was beaten, but...parents can speak to a child in a way that is totally demoralizing. They can make a child feel as if they can\u2019t do anything right, as if they\u2019re worthless. I believe that Abraham could be verbally abusive at times, but, Mr. Hall, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s particular to members of our church. Sadly, I\u2019ve seen many a father rip a child apart, and too often, that child can grow to believe himself worthless and incapable of doing anything right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you would describe your church as a strict group, but certainly not fanatical,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>Wilson laughed. \u201cWe are different. The Mormons are seen as different, as are the Amish. But we are Christians. We do believe in God in His Heaven, and we believe, equally, that there are evil forces. We believe in sin, but as Christ stated, true remorse brings us to the forgiveness of sins. We don\u2019t seek to harm anyone else, and we don\u2019t punish those who leave the church. We are all creatures of free choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, it\u2019s true that we all have a tendency to mistrust each other, to be suspicious of what we don\u2019t understand. You don\u2019t believe that Malachi is a killer, so I\u2019m going to assume that Abraham Smith had enemies.\u201d</p><p>Wilson was quiet for a minute. \u201cI\u2019m curious that you\u2019ve come here. I do read the papers, though I don\u2019t have a television. The police say that Malachi is the alleged killer of Mr. Andres of Andover and Mr. Covington, as well. What enemies would they have had that they shared with Abraham Smith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to find out,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>Wilson let out a long sigh. \u201cDo I believe that Malachi is a killer? No. Might there be something in him that I never saw? Possibly. Did Abraham have enemies? Most definitely. Only two other families with children in that area belong to our congregation, and they keep very quiet. The rest of those people...they tolerate the Wiccans in the community, thinking of them as actors, really, drawing in the tourists. They tolerate Catholic, Jewish, agnostic, atheistic, Baptist and probably Buddhist. But us? We live too simply for them. They don\u2019t understand that we honestly believe that we are judged daily, that God will come again, and that we can choose to lead pure lives, or we can choose to sin. If Abraham did have real enemies, they did not come from this church. We are of a like mind and, if anyone had a serious problem with him, they would have had a problem with all of us probably, and would have come to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he ever seem to be afraid of anyone? Did he have comments about the murders of his neighbor, or Mr. Andres?\u201d</p><p>Wilson shrugged. \u201cWell, he believed that God himself determined that Peter Andres should be killed. He told me he wouldn\u2019t have been surprised to see the Grim Reaper himself or an avenging angel come down to kill Peter Andres. Then again, Peter Andres had said that Abraham was a wart not just on the community, but on the world, and that he was ruining his one and only child. I believe Andres intended to look into social services and see if he could get the boy taken away from Abraham, but to my knowledge, nothing was ever done. Andres was a big, scary man, and I\u2019d believe more easily that he would have offered violence to the Smiths. But since he died first, he can hardly be suspected of Abraham\u2019s murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course. What about his neighbor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Abraham kept to himself, from what I understood. Except that he ranted and raved a lot\u2014and yelled at Malachi loudly enough for people in the next block to hear. One of his punishments was to make the kid stand out in the cold, against the front of the house. I doubt if his neighbors liked that much\u2014it\u2019s embarrassing to everyone to see cruelty. Of course, they lived in the Lexington House, and the house itself has a reputation. I\u2019m sure some people believe that evil lives in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you believe?\u201d Sam asked him.</p><p>\u201cDoes evil live on?\u201d Wilson asked thoughtfully. \u201cEvil remains, where it has always been, in the heart of man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInnocents\u2014those who were loyal enough to risk their lives rather than tell the lie that they had signed the devil\u2019s book\u2014were the ones who went to the gallows, you know, back during the witchcraft scare,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThe trials were bizarre! Those who admitted to witchcraft and confessed weren\u2019t hanged. Those who clung passionately to their belief that such a lie would be against God...they\u2019re the ones who suffered the death penalty!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know.

He started toward the door.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Hall,\u201d Wilson called.</p><p>Sam stopped and turned back.</p><p>\u201cBut, was the devil busy at work in Massachusetts in 1692? Yes. He is always busy. So, please, don\u2019t delude yourself. The devil is still alive and well and busy in Massachusetts, in the world, just as he was in 1692.\u201d</p><p>6</p><p>Little had changed at Sedge\u2019s Market since Jenna was last there. Milton Sedge ran a clean store with neat, tight aisles and five checkout lanes. Bananas and prime rib were on special. Large cardboard, handwritten signs advertised the daily deals. He had long been a holdout as far as credit cards went, but he, like the rest of the world, seemed to have succumbed to the necessity of plastic. The one thing that had changed was that.</p> <p>A friendly girl at one of the registers directed Jenna to a rear office. She didn\u2019t get far, however, before she saw the man she sort of recognized as Milton Sedge himself. He was in a butcher\u2019s coat, directing an employee to clean out one of the meat cabinets. He was doing so pleasantly enough, but efficiency and survival seemed to be on his mind.</p><p>\u201cDates, Richard\u2014come on! Pay attention to the dates. We never sell anything once it\u2019s past its date. That\u2019s how we compete with the big guys. Quality\u2014and assurance!\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>The worker was a slim youth who appeared to be about seventeen. He nodded vigorously with his compliance. \u201cYes, sir, yes, sir, I\u2019m on it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Sedge?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>He turned to look at her, a balding man with a large nose and massive eyebrows that seemed to be trying to compensate for the loss of hair on his head.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d He stared at her, as if trying to decide if he knew her or not.</p> <p>\u201cHi. I\u2019m Jenna Duffy,\u201d she said, offering her hand.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a job?\u201d he asked skeptically, openly studying her.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, sir. I\u2019m working with Sam Hill on Malachi Smith\u2019s defense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Well, you know I gave my statement to the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. I know that you did. I\u2019m just trying to hear what you have to say with my own ears and, also, to ask you, of course, if you\u2019re certain about your statement.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, distracted. An elderly woman with a cart had come next to them. \u201cMilton, where are those bananas?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cEleanor, what? You\u2019re not going senile, are you? The bananas are in the fruit section!\u201d Sedge said, scratching his head. \u201cShow some good old New England common sense, will you, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMilton, I\u2019m full of good New England common sense. There are no bananas in the fruit section, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking you!\u201d the woman said, indignant.</p> <p>\u201cRichard! Will you go to the back and see that the bananas are restocked!\u201d Sedge asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s step into my office, shall we?\u201d Sedge suggested. \u201cIt\u2019s just to the left, behind the pharmacy.\u201d</p><p>A few seconds later Jenna was seated on a foldout chair between boxes of crackers and he was behind a desk stacked high with invoices. He folded his hands on the desk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken some guff over this, I\u2019ll have you know. But what I saw is what I saw!\u201d Sedge said. \u201cWhat is\u2014is. And that\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, guff?\u201d Jenna asked him.</p><p>He looked at her as if she had lost her mind, as well. \u201cGuff! Guff! Grief! All kinds of misery. Folks around here believe that Malachi killed Earnest Covington, and that I\u2019m the one who has lost my eyesight. But that boy was in this store from four to six last Saturday afternoon\u2014the kid liked shopping, read every label on every can. I think he just liked being away from home. The cops found that guy\u2019s body at six-thirty and claimed he\u2019d been dead for over an hour. So, if someone is mistaken, it\u2019s the damned doctor who showed up on the site, not me. I talked to the kid. He was a regular. He was always on a budget, so he was like Eleanor, demanding to know where the daily specials could be found. Except that Malachi Smith didn\u2019t demand. The kid was polite. Yeah, I can see where his classmates thought he was a geek. Skinny kid. Big eyes. Bad haircut. But he was polite. He was always stopping to get something off a top shelf for the old ladies. He waited his turn in a line. He paid with cash.\u201d</p><p>The last seemed to be the asset that truly set Malachi Smith at the top of Sedge\u2019s list.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know exactly how long he was in the store?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>\u201cI was in the front when he came in\u2014Mrs. Mickleberry was arguing about a coupon that was good at another store\u2014and I happened to be picking up a broken bottle of ketchup on one of the aisles about fifteen minutes later. We talked about a cut of meat about twenty minutes after that. I was working in the dairy section when he went through. I know that kid was in the store at the time they say Earnest Covington was killed. People around here want me to say otherwise, but I won\u2019t. What is\u2014is.\u201d He sniffed. \u201cThose kids at the school have had it out for Malachi forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich kids?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>\u201cThe ones who claimed to have seen him come out of the house that day. Now, why anyone would believe that David Yates over me, I don\u2019t begin to understand. Oh, yeah. Because he\u2019s on the football team.\u201d Sedge shook his head. \u201cBig brawny kid on the football team, and he and his pals tormented poor skinny Malachi. People need to use sense and logic. Yep, sense and logic. The Yates kid and his backfield mom are just as bad. Now, I didn\u2019t say that. You ask me\u2014and I\u2019m no psychiatrist\u2014guilt started eating at that kid and in his own messed-up adolescent mind he knew he was guilty as hell of being one bastard, excuse the language. Whatever. I know what I know. My eyes are sound, and I\u2019m not involved in any of the crazy shenanigans going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Sedge. It\u2019s wonderful that you\u2019re not letting yourself be swayed by peer pressure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is\u2014is,\u201d he repeated. \u201cThat kid might be crazy as hell, might be a mental midget, and he might have done anything else in the world\u2014I couldn\u2019t argue it. But I can tell you this and it\u2019s a fact\u2014he didn\u2019t kill Earnest Covington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalachi claims that he\u2019s innocent, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he wasn\u2019t arrested for killing Covington, was he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s being charged in the deaths of his family. I\u2019m not sure, but I believe, if the prosecutor feels he gets a little more evidence, he also plans on adding charges, and I know that the police believe that Malachi killed Peter Andres and Earnest Covington, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t kill Covington. And I told the cops that. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re thinking, not to listen to me. Unless folks just get stuff stuck in their minds so hard they can\u2019t see the light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re truly grateful for the courage of your convictions, Mr. Sedge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for sticking with the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth is the truth. He didn\u2019t kill Covington.\u201d</p><p>Jenna rose.</p><p>\u201cOf course...\u201d Sedge began, rising politely.</p><p>\u201cOf course what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t take an ax to his mom and dad. Hell, if I\u2019d been that kid, I\u2019d have been tempted to take an ax to that old Abraham Smith!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d John Alden told Sam, \u201cyou need to thank God that usually, even with the mayhem that goes on around Haunted Happenings, we\u2019re mostly a good, law-abiding place. With Malachi in custody, I haven\u2019t been finding bodies anywhere, and I have the time to do this with you.\u201d</p><p>John Alden had agreed to show Sam around Earnest Covington\u2019s house. They stood just outside, and Sam waited for John to let him in and give him whatever instructions he might feel obligated as a detective to give.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a true gem, John, and a great believer in justice,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cActually, you know, the cops usually work with the prosecutors,\u201d John reminded him.</p><p>\u201cAh, but, first and foremost, you are a great believer in justice, and therefore agree that the defense has the right to question witnesses and investigate when a client makes a plea of not guilty. You wouldn\u2019t want to get caught up in any red tape, and you like to keep an eye on me.\u201d</p><p>The policeman sighed. \u201cEarnest Covington was a widower, lived alone, but he ordered out a lot, so it was actually a kid from the Pizza Palace who found him. The door was ajar so the kid just came in and saw Covington on the floor, right in front of the hearth. The chalk marks are still there\u2014as is the blood spatter,\u201d John said, his mouth growing tight.</p><p>Covington\u2019s house was built in much the same style as the Lexington House: front and back entries, parlors to either side of the entrance, and a narrow stairway that led to several rooms above. There was an attic as well, but according to the police report, it didn\u2019t appear that the house had been ransacked in any way. Just as in the murder of Peter Andres, it appeared that the killer came with but one thing in mind\u2014murder.</p><p>\u201cThe pizza kid found the door ajar?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cYep, just like I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid your crime-scene people find anything that indicated that the killer had jimmied the lock in any way?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d John said. He sighed again. \u201cAnd before you ask, there were so many fingerprints on the door that the lab is still working on sorting them all out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what made you suspect Malachi Smith?\u201d Sam demanded.</p><p>John\u2019s eyes narrowed and he offered Sam a grim smile. \u201cBecause we already suspected him in the case of Peter Andres.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut why? From everything that I\u2019ve heard, Malachi liked the teacher. And Peter Andres liked Malachi well enough\u2014he hated Abraham Smith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019d been trouble, bad blood with Malachi,\u201d John said. \u201cGod knows, maybe at one time, Jamie O\u2019Neill might have been able to help him. I know that O\u2019Neill kept trying\u2014despite the system that gave the kid back to his parents without interference\u2014and he might have had some luck with him. But, come on\u2014the kids were terrified of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn, he was like the runt of the litter\u2014picked on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd, sometimes, Sam, when kids pick on another kid, there\u2019s a good reason. Oh, come on, you know that the signs of a serial killer can be seen at a young age. Sickos who throw rocks at dogs and kill kittens.\u201d</p><p>Sam stared at John. \u201cAnd did anyone ever report that Malachi Smith killed a kitten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot actually?\u201d Sam demanded.</p><p>\u201cKids talk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you know of a kitten that was killed?\u201d</p><p>John opened his mouth, arched his eyebrows and then closed his mouth again. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn, you persecuted that kid because of hearsay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Sam, you weren\u2019t here. Something really happened to the Yates kid\u2014David. He was in agony. Whether Malachi Smith just has something about him that threatened the other kids or not, he\u2019s strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you can be tried for murder just for being strange,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I should ignore all the warning signs\u2014not to mention the fact that the kid was covered in his family\u2019s blood\u2014and fail to make an arrest? He hasn\u2019t been charged with the murder of Earnest Covington or that of Peter Andres. He was a person of interest, that\u2019s all. And in the Covington case, Yates and his friend said that they saw him coming from Earnest Covington\u2019s house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd Milton Sedge said that the kid was in his store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just said that he\u2019d only been a person of interest,\u201d John told him.</p><p>Sam let out a long breath and knew that he needed to maintain control. John Alden was legally obligated to give him certain information vital to the case, but he didn\u2019t have to go out of his way to be helpful. He couldn\u2019t push the man too far; he was already basically questioning his police work.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, John. If he was brought into court on the Covington murder, I\u2019d rip the prosecution to shreds in a matter of minute. These days, I have to prove reasonable doubt, and in a he-said-he-said situation, I\u2019d sure as hell have doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam, you saw him the night I arrested him. What would you have done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArrested him,\u201d Sam admitted after a long pause.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t judge. I\u2019m not on the bench, and I won\u2019t be on the jury,\u201d the policeman said. \u201cI try to maintain the law. I\u2019m not out for Malachi Smith. Prove to me the kid is innocent, and I\u2019ll be the first to tear apart the world trying to get at the truth. But right now, he looks like our man.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded. \u201cOf course. And thank you, John.\u201d</p> <p>John nodded back.</p><p>\u201cSo, the killer came in by the door\u2014without forcing it\u2014and apparently came right at Earnest Covington, sliced him to death and left,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>John nodded, watching him. Sam walked back to the front door, halfway closed it, pushed it open and walked into the hall. He looked to the right and left, and headed in toward the hearth in the parlor to the left. Earnest Covington must have been standing by his hearth. On the mantel, Sam saw that he kept a kept a metal receptacle for mail. Possibly he was looking through his bills when his killer entered. Sam took a closer look. There was a letter in the bin that looked as if it had been almost shoved back in, a letter postmarked Sydney, Australia. The sender was an Earnest Covington, Jr. Through the envelope, he could see the outline of photographs; Covington might not have owned a computer or a cell phone.</p><p>Blood spattered the cheap Rembrandt knockoff on the wall above the mantel. The floor in front of the mantel was still soaked with a dark stain.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one thing I should tell you,\u201d John said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother reason Malachi Smith came to mind\u2014around here, folks aren\u2019t great at locking their doors. Earnest Covington almost never did, according to his neighbors. He told them he didn\u2019t have anything worth anything, and if some poor fellow walked in, he was welcome to take what he could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did that make you think of Malachi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalachi lives in the neighborhood and he would have known that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he supposed to have bad blood with Earnest Covington?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the kid\u2014the old man. Covington was pretty vocal about the fact that he thought Abraham Smith should sell the house...and get out of the neighborhood. But, to be honest, I never heard about anything negative happening between Malachi and Covington\u2014in fact, once, when Covington fell on an icy step, Malachi came over, dialed 911 and stayed with him until help came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat really suggests murder,\u201d Sam said quietly.</p><p>John shrugged. \u201cMaybe the old man\u2014Abraham Smith\u2014killed his enemies, and his son freaked out and killed his father and family when he found out. You know, religious duty and all. Now, there\u2019s a rational theory for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA rational theory\u2014just as rational as someone else having committed all the murders,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>John watched from the doorway. \u201cReasonable doubt\u2014maybe you could prove that if Malachi had been charged with Covington\u2019s murder. But reasonable doubt on his family when we found him bathed in blood? Sam Hall, you have a hell of an uphill road ahead of you!\u201d</p><p>Sam suddenly wished that Jenna was with him. He wasn\u2019t sure that he believed in \u201cpostcognition,\u201d but he wasn\u2019t getting a thing himself. It all seemed too simple.</p><p>\u201cMind if I walk around the house?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cKnock yourself out. Covington has one son, lives in Australia. He\u2019s a single father, twin two-year-olds. We\u2019ve been keeping him informed on the investigation through Skype online. I\u2019m sure if you think it will help solve the mystery of his father\u2019s murder, he\u2019ll be all for an explanation. You just promise me one thing, Sam Hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we prove that Malachi Smith killed these people, and you do wind up defending him with the excuse that he\u2019s crazy as all hell, you don\u2019t demand that he be let out on the streets in a year!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise you, the actual murderer will be locked away for a long, long time,\u201d Sam said with final authority.</p><p>Jenna saw John Alden\u2019s police car on the street. Crime-scene tape hung from the door and the door itself was ajar. She hesitated before touching the knob.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d she called.</p><p>John Alden came and opened the door for her. \u201cMiss Duffy. What a surprise. Only it\u2019s not a surprise\u2014right? Sam probably just called you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s upstairs. Come on in. Though why he called you, I don\u2019t really know. You don\u2019t seem to react well at a crime scene, and I\u2019m damned glad. That makes you nicely human.\u201d</p><p>He meant to be nice. She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re FBI, eh?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cTougher than I look, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you must get lots of blood and guts,\u201d John said.</p><p>\u201cI do, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, sorry for being abrasive. You\u2019re right\u2014when it stops bothering us, we need to get the hell out of law enforcement.\u201d</p><p>Jenna heard footsteps coming down the stairs and then Sam\u2019s voice. \u201cJenna! You\u2019re here.\u201d He glanced at John. \u201cWe happened to talk. She was in the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d said the cop.</p><p>Sam grinned at him. He looked at Jenna again. His expression was grave and yet, he seemed relieved. Maybe he\u2019d been afraid she would refuse to come, after the way they had parted. He had almost called her a charlatan.</p><p>\u201cJenna, here\u2019s what I know, what I suspect. Earnest Covington was known to leave his door open. He wasn\u2019t afraid of thieves. So, he either left his door open and the killer walked in\u2014and caught him in front of the hearth\u2014or he let his killer in, they came into the parlor together, and then the killer struck. I\u2019ve a hunch it was the former rather than the latter. I think that Earnest Covington was just about to go through his mail, something he probably wouldn\u2019t be doing with company. Plus, the first letter in the mail grate is from his son. There\u2019s a picture in it, and he might have been about to admire his grandsons.\u201d</p><p>Jenna looked at him and nodded. \u201cMakes sense. I\u2019m going to just take a look around, too, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d Sam replied, and began a conversation with the policeman that seemed more like a smokescreen for her than anything real.</p><p>She walked back to the door to let her mind encompass what had taken place, while she tried to let her heart imagine Earnest Covington. She closed her eyes and had an impression of an older man\u2014the perfect grandfather figure. He\u2019d had white hair, he\u2019d been lean and weathered, a man who had worked through his prime, and was still fierce in his thoughts and opinions. His life was somewhat lonely, but he didn\u2019t mind\u2014his wife was gone, and he wanted no other. He lived to tell the occasional visitor what Salem had been like before they\u2019d gone modern-day witch crazy, before they\u2019d become so commercial and when the House of the Seven Gables hadn\u2019t been blocked from view by a dozen gift shops hawking witch T-shirts.</p><p>As she thought these things, it seemed that a shadowy haze slipped over her, and the house. She had a sense of coming home and leaving the door open. Who would want his old stuff? The sofa with the upholstery that was all lumpy, or the TV that barely worked and certainly wasn\u2019t attached to any newfangled gadgets. He walked into the living room, having just been for a stroll down the street. He smiled, thinking of the letter his son had sent. Wretched boy, falling in love with a foreigner, and heading off with her to Australia. It was with a heavy heart that he thought of the daughter-in-law he\u2019d met at the wedding but never seen again. She\u2019d died in a flash from a virus that no one had been able to stop. So now, of course, his son was still in Australia, but Earnest hoped that he\u2019d come home soon enough, when the boys were a little bit older and his in-laws learned to live with their loss. For now, he had the pictures that Andrew sent, like these new ones.... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He hadn\u2019t really heard the door open; he just became aware that someone was with him.</p><p>He\u2019d been puzzled at first; in fact, he had laughed.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re looking to do something creepy at the old Lexington House, it\u2019s down the street at the end of the block,\u201d he said, not unwarmly.</p> <p>The costumed intruder just stared at him.</p><p>\u201cPrivate residence!\u201d Earnest said, growing aggravated. He\u2019d seen similar costumes before. It was like something out of the old days when the Puritan ministers tried to scare their flocks with pictures of an evil, horned and tailed devil. Of course, this person didn\u2019t really have a tail. He was wearing a cloak, with a hood, the horns stuck out from the hood. The mask was red and black\u2014of course, the devil was red, like a fierce, burning fire\u2014or black, in the way that a heart could be black, and the costume was damned creepy and scary.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he said. \u201cMy house\u2014I don\u2019t remember inviting you in!\u201d</p><p>The person stood very still for a moment\u2014almost as if he was confused, or uncertain.</p><p>Then, the figure drew its hands from beneath the folds of the cape.</p> <p>Earnest was briefly aware of a shining blade.</p><p>He barely had time to throw his hands up to protect his face....</p><p>And all to no avail.</p><p>He was aware of a crunch as the ax hit his skull; he was even aware of the warm spray of blood that sailed around him, oddly beautiful. Red like the devil himself....</p><p>He hit the floor.</p><p>And knew he was dying.</p> <p>\u201cJenna!\u201d</p><p>She gave herself a shake, mentally and physically, and refocused. Sam was standing in front of her; his hands were on her shoulders. His eyes, gray and sharp, were hard upon hers.</p><p>She knew that John Alden was standing right behind him.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to say anything in front of the man who already thought she was a squeamish crackpot, especially not in front of John, who had yet to judge her as such.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve pictured it as you said, Sam,\u201d she said simply, \u201cand I believe that you\u2019re right. I think that Earnest Covington came in and left his door open. I think he might have been anticipating the pleasure of looking at the pictures again. The killer just walked right in and killed him.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded. He turned to John Alden. \u201cThanks, John. I\u2019m not trying to let killers loose on the streets, I swear. I appreciate your helping see to it that the defense has all the facts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want the prosecution losing on a technicality\u2014as in the defense not having everything it\u2019s legally due,\u201d John said. He looked at Sam. \u201cHey, come on, I\u2019m not a mean or horrible man! I feel sorry for the kid. But I feel even sorrier for Peter Andres and Earnest Covington.... And the Smith family, of course.\u201d</p><p>The last was definitely added as an afterthought, Jenna was certain.</p> <p>\u201cAll right then, we\u2019ll get out of your way, John,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cI drove you here,\u201d John reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI have a car,\u201d Jenna said quickly.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Keep me posted if you need anything else,\u201d John said.</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Sam told him.</p><p>He opened the door for Jenna, nudging it with his elbow. They walked outside.</p><p>\u201cThe car is down the street, at the grass by the cliff-side park,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>He nodded, walking alongside her. They passed Lexington House and both of them paused. Crime-scene tape still roped off the entire property. Fierce signs warned the curious off: arrests would be made for trespassing and interference.</p><p>\u201cCovington\u2019s house is seriously just a block away,\u201d Jenna murmured.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you won\u2019t have a problem in court as far as the Covington killing is concerned\u2014if Malachi is charged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI went to see the grocer. He\u2019s convincing. Sedge swears up and down that he saw Malachi several times during the hours when the M.E. says that Covington was killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s great. You, uh, just decided to interview him?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. He wasn\u2019t angry; he was slightly amused.</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling that my people skills may be better than yours, at times,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded and took her elbow. Even by the light of day, Lexington House had a depressing facade, and it seemed that the windows were horrible eyes with evil intent\u2014watching out for the unwary.</p><p>Sam had drawn his eyes from the house. \u201cSo?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you really see?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She groaned. \u201cI\u2019m not talking to you about anything\u2014just the facts, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, please. I\u2019m sorry. Tell me what you really saw, felt...or imagined in your mind.\u201d</p><p>Imagined in your mind. Was that his way of saying that he was interested in her visions revealed?</p><p>She stopped walking again and stared at him. \u201cI saw that the killer wore a costume again. I\u2019m not sure that either of these two men knew, even as they died, who did it. The costume could just be some kind of a logical choice because it is Salem, where people are known to have a deep and profound belief in both God and the devil, or the person really believes that they need to dress up as something to get away with murder. Right now, though, in either case, with Haunted Happenings going on, who in the world is going to really notice anyone in costume?\u201d</p><p>She expected him to groan and say that, of course, even if she might have some kind of special ESP\u2014it wasn\u2019t telling them a thing.</p><p>He didn\u2019t. He looked at her, as if perplexed. \u201cNow Haunted Happenings is going on. Now you might not notice someone in a costume. Peter Andres was killed six months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Jenna admitted.</p><p>They reached her car and the park at the cliff. He didn\u2019t get in but walked past it and started up the path that led to the cliff. It wasn\u2019t a high cliff, but rather a rise created from the jagged granite that was the solid base of so much of the area.</p><p>There were scattered trees, creating a copse here and there, to the northern portion of the little park. Where the ground leveled at the top of the rise, there was a walkway to the edge, which overlooked the water. Sam followed the path, and Jenna followed Sam.</p><p>White waves crashed with a fury in the autumn wind that rushed around them, stronger here, or so it seemed, than when they\u2019d been down on the sidewalk by the neighborhood of old houses.</p><p>Sam stood staring out over the water.</p><p>\u201cI used to come here myself,\u201d he said, looking out. \u201cIt was always a great place to come and work out whatever adolescent problems I was having.\u201d He turned to look at her. \u201cMalachi said he was here when his family was murdered. I can imagine him coming here often. Somehow, being here makes you realize that your problems aren\u2019t so great, there\u2019s a vast world out there and we\u2019re only a small part of it. I always loved the way the ocean seems angry here. I don\u2019t remember ever coming when the waves weren\u2019t white capped, and the crash of the sea against stone wasn\u2019t loud and passionate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful little area,\u201d Jenna agreed.</p><p>He pointed to the trees. \u201cKids come here to neck. And smoke pot.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cDid you come here to smoke and neck?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cSure. I was a kid once. Believe it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I even vaguely remember.\u201d</p><p>He studied her. \u201cYou would have been accused of witchcraft, back in the day, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly,\u201d she said. \u201cI like to think I would have kept the concept of seeing or feeling the past to myself. But thank God I don\u2019t have to as much in this century.\u201d</p><p>He sat down on the grass by the cliff. Puzzled, she joined him. \u201cOf course, if you\u2019d been one of the magistrates, Sam Hall, you would have laughed the whole thing out of existence, since you don\u2019t believe in anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said that I don\u2019t believe in anything,\u201d he said, plucking a blade of grass from the ground and running it through his fingers. He looked at her. \u201cThe law was quite different then, you know. We\u2019ve come a long way. The colony was English. And the entire Christian world believed in witchcraft. It was a way to cast and apportion blame. To explain the unexplainable. I don\u2019t know why, but I keep thinking that there is some kind of answer in this that has to do with the past. The thing is, witchcraft was illegal and punishable by death back then. If you commit murder in death penalty states nowadays, you may be executed for the crime. It\u2019s the law. A judge is legally and morally responsible to hand out sentences that conform to the law. Now, we have the concepts of legal and illegal searches, individual rights and so on. The people of 1692 weren\u2019t protected that way\u2014they seldom had any kind of representation. When I decided to go into the law, I would pretend that I had been Rebecca Nurse\u2019s defense attorney. If I\u2019d been there, of course, she wouldn\u2019t have hanged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019d appreciate that,\u201d Jenna said, smiling.</p><p>He grinned in turn.</p><p>\u201cSalem and Salem Village were in turmoil. The Puritans might have adhered to strict teaching, but they weren\u2019t above wanting to make money. At the time, the Porters and the Putnams and others\u2014even though some of the families were actually intermarried\u2014were having all kinds of land disputes. They\u2019d been around for many years, so I\u2019d say a good part of the population was related in one way or another. But, hey, it\u2019s hard to imagine, but true, that in royal and noble families brothers and nephews killed one another over a crown. So, it\u2019s not so hard to believe that they let bitterness carry them away here. Whether or not they really knew it, the people were probably letting their anger with each other prejudice their belief in what was happening. Hey, if you\u2019re really mad at someone, it\u2019s easier to think ill of them. And I think about kids\u2014maybe they weren\u2019t malicious, maybe they even believed part of what they were saying\u2014you tell a lie often enough and it becomes real in your own mind.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOne of the first women accused was Sarah Bishop,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cShe was supposedly disagreeable, and her husband\u2019s children from a previous marriage also wanted property she owned. They say, too, that she wore a scarlet bodice\u2014not very Puritan of her!\u2014and had drinking parties. She\u2019d been accused before, so she was an easy target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the first people hanged,\u201d Sam said. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t confess to being a witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Malachi will not confess to being a murderer,\u201d Jenna said.</p> <p>Sam nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s an easy target, too,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m willing to bet he\u2019s being targeted for a reason. It looks like all evidence is against him\u2014just as, to the Puritans, it looked as if there was solid evidence against those they executed. And Giles Corey\u2014pressed to death because he wouldn\u2019t make a plea. The old bastard didn\u2019t intend to let anyone get a hold of his property, and by the legal system, not giving a plea protected his property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have let them have my property,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cLife is so much better.\u201d</p><p>Sam laughed. \u201cMe, too, probably. But by the law, if he didn\u2019t plead, he couldn\u2019t be tried, and because he wasn\u2019t tried, he died in full possession of his property. And to force someone to make a plea so that they could be tried, they were pressed. Giles Corey was an old buzzard\u2014he testified against his own wife. But he endured two days of pain\u2014his tongue bulged out and the sheriff had to put it back in his mouth with his cane, and the old man still endured. \u2018More weight!\u2019 is all that he ever said, according to the records, and witnesses were horrified. What happened, of course, wasn\u2019t caused by any one person, but belief mingling with old grievances and the social structure and laws of the day. The thing is, we\u2019ve come far, but we\u2019ll never get past being human. Malachi isn\u2019t accepted in society. Good people will easily believe he could be a killer. I have to prove reasonable doubt, and that\u2019s going to be hard. He wasn\u2019t arrested for murdering Peter Andres or Earnest Covington; he was arrested for the murders of his family. I have all kinds of motions filed, but since he wasn\u2019t legally accused of the other murders, I most probably won\u2019t be able to use the fact that he was seen elsewhere when Earnest Covington was murdered. It depends on how all the motions filed sit with the judge. I have to prove reasonable doubt in those murders, and since he was covered in their blood...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis explanation is reasonable,\u201d Jenna pointed out.</p><p>Sam stood and offered a hand down to her. \u201cBridget Bishop wasn\u2019t really hanged for what she did. She was hanged for who she was.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou believe that Malachi is facing the same fate?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. But with one big difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe law has become more equitable?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>Sam grinned. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has me.\u201d She was startled when he touched her cheek in something that was almost a tender gesture.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d he added, \u201che has you.\u201d</p><p>7</p> <p>Sam joined them again that night at dinner, but it wasn\u2019t much of a social occasion. He spent half of his time on the phone with his assistant in Boston, discussing the paperwork he wanted done. During the meal, he talked earnestly with Jamie, wanting to know more about the boy\u2019s psychological makeup. Jenna spent most of the evening listening, and realizing that the more she watched Sam, the more she was drawn to him. She hated to admit the fact\u2014even to herself, or especially to herself\u2014that there was something about the testosterone-filled energy he exuded that was seducing her.</p><p>Sam mentioned that he was going to visit Malachi in his hospital-slash-jail cell tomorrow, and then head to his office to deal with some of the massive amounts of paperwork that seemed to go with every sneeze. It had to be done\u2014it was the major part of the game of law. Jamie was going to accompany him and spend time with Malachi.</p><p>\u201cThe law these days is demanding,\u201d Sam began. \u201cBut ultimately it\u2019s a good thing. The witchcrafts trials couldn\u2019t have existed today, but we learned a lot about \u2018hearsay\u2019 evidence because of the injustices of the past. And, thank God, there\u2019s no longer such a thing as \u2018spectral\u2019 evidence. But, the paperwork! I really want to talk to the Yates kid, but his mother has threatened me with every lawsuit in the book if I go near him. I\u2019m going to have to have help on that. And I\u2019d also like to have an interview with Samantha Yeager, find out what, if anything, her connection to the Smiths was. But I have to head into Boston and the office for a few hours. You should probably come with us,\u201d Sam told Jenna.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I would be worthless helping you with legal paperwork,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou could spend the time with Malachi and see if there was something else in his mind that might help us, something we haven\u2019t discovered yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie is his friend, and has been his doctor,\u201d Jenna pointed out. \u201cI can get more done here.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cJenna\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I can get near David Yates,\u201d she said.</p> <p>That brought a frown. \u201cIt could be dangerous for you to be here,\u201d Sam said, looking at Jamie as if for help, but not wanting to give away what happened yesterday.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Federal agent,\u201d Jenna reminded him. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not going to change. I can handle myself around dangerous people. But, besides that, no one is going to attack me. The killer would know that the second something happened while Malachi was in custody, the whole concept that he was a maniacal killer driven to acts of extreme violence because of some strict fundamentalist upbringing would be in the trash, and the hunt would be on again. I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll be more helpful here.\u201d</p><p>Sam wagged a finger at her. \u201cYou need to be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always am,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cJamie?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cSam, she just looks really sweet. There\u2019s little as tough as an Irishwoman,\u201d Jamie confirmed.</p><p>She looked at her uncle, not sure whether to appreciate his support, or tell him that she wasn\u2019t exactly a sumo wrestler. But she did want to explore on her own, and even though it seemed that Sam wasn\u2019t scoffing her \u201csight\u201d in the way he had been, she knew that he had difficulty believing in any kind of ESP.</p><p>\u201cSee? Tougher than nails,\u201d Jenna said. She smiled, liking the way Sam was looking at her. It was nice to feel that he came with the instinct to protect, even if she didn\u2019t feel that she needed to be protected. Certainly not in broad daylight, and not when the streets were filled with people.</p><p>Then again, she had to admit, protection wasn\u2019t exactly what she wanted when she looked at him....</p><p>Not good.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Sam said, \u201cbut you need to stay out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of trouble could I possibly get into?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLegal trouble, too,\u201d Sam said gruffly.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, there\u2019s nothing for you to worry about. The killer honestly can\u2019t act at all. We\u2019ve agreed we\u2019re not dealing with an all-out psycho who\u2019s acting willy-nilly, but with someone possessing very specific, material motives. So, you see, in the devious little plot\u2014whatever it might be\u2014that\u2019s going on, I couldn\u2019t possibly be safer.\u201d</p><p>Soon after, she walked Sam to the door. She found him hesitating as he said good-night; he looked at her awkwardly, which seemed odd\u2014he was so totally a man of the world. She couldn\u2019t imagine that he had ever been awkward in a social situation.</p><p>But they weren\u2019t exactly in a social situation.</p><p>He started to say something, and then didn\u2019t. Then he touched her cheek again, and his fingers seemed to linger just a minute.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, kid, really,\u201d he said, and his voice was gruff.</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cIn my experience, honestly, a ghost never killed anyone.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cThe scariest unknown in the world is the human mind,\u201d she continued on. \u201cBut in that, a ghost is no scarier than a dog, really. But any kind of suggestion is like hypnotism. People have claimed that all kinds of things have \u2018made them do it.\u2019 A dog, video games, television, the movies, ghosts\u2014or the devil. I\u2019m not afraid of ghosts. I can be very leery and careful of people, but I won\u2019t do anything that could remotely be considered dangerous, okay?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. He stood there another minute, looking at her, and she was surprised that, although he no longer touched her, she could feel warmth emanating from him that almost reached out and stroked the length of her body. Heat rushed through her, and it was very hard to maintain her even eye contact with him, to give nothing away of the sudden longing that rushed through her.</p><p>Was it him?</p><p>Was it wishful thinking?</p><p>She wasn\u2019t without self-confidence, but she knew his type.</p><p>Type? she mocked herself. Wasn\u2019t that judging unfairly?</p><p>He was wealthy; he was a powerful man, and he had the kind of steadfast assurance that was sensual in itself. He drew attention when he walked into a room. Men admired him, and women fantasized about him.</p><p>Which, of course, she was doing right then.</p><p>And women would easily come, and just as easily go, out of his life.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d he said somewhere in the middle of her internal monologue. And then he was gone.</p><p>That night, she felt something on her bed. And again, despite her assurances about ghosts to Sam, despite her beliefs, she felt an odd sensation of fear. She wanted to reach for the light. She wanted to run out of the house.</p><p>There was an old woman sitting at her bedside. A very sad-looking old woman.</p><p>For an insane moment she thought that the ghost, apparition or figment of her imagination was going to say something incredibly grave and overused, such as \u201cThe truth is out there!\u201d</p><p>But the figure simply stared at her with dignity, and then spoke softly. \u201cYou must save the innocents. Let not the blood of the innocent be shed.\u201d</p><p>And then, Jenna felt a stirring of the air, and something that seemed cold and warm at the same time touch her cheek. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>An old woman\u2019s gentle touch.</p><p>\u201cLet not your blood be spilled\u2014for the devil lives, he lives in all of us. Sometimes his name is Envy, and sometimes it is Greed. Let not the blood be spilled....\u201d</p><p>It was everything she could do not to scream.</p> <p>The vision faded into the night.</p><p>Jenna leaped from her bed and hurried into the kitchen. As she knew, Jamie always had a bottle of good Irish whiskey on hand.</p><p>She found the bottle and gulped down a burning shot.</p><p>And then she took another. She noted that the darkness of night was just beginning to break. Morning was coming. Sleep, just a few hours, brought on by the relaxing quality of the alcohol, would be great just about now.</p><p>At his office, Sam thanked God for the competency of Evan Richardson, legal assistant extraordinaire. Sam inspected the paperwork on the motions filed. The prosecution would fight many of his motions regarding what could and could not be brought into evidence. In defense of his client, Sam would make court appearances himself, but Evan was exceptional at keeping the legal paperwork moving at an expert rate. Since they were not going for an insanity plea, Sam had planned to deny the prosecution\u2019s request for their expert psychiatrist\u2019s opinion on Malachi\u2019s mental stability.</p> <p>\u201cBut what if you do have to switch over to a mental competency plea?\u201d Evan asked worriedly.</p><p>Sam smiled. \u201cAt that point, we\u2019ll allow them their expert. Not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Are we moving to keep allegations regarding the other murders out?\u201d Evan asked.</p><p>Sam shook his head. \u201cNo, because we have a discrepancy on that. If the prosecution wants to bring up the other murders\u2014which I don\u2019t believe they\u2019re willing to risk at this time\u2014we have witnesses that will cast the shadow of doubt, affecting their entire case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, all right,\u201d Evan said. He chewed on the nib of his pencil. \u201cSam, you\u2019re taking a huge risk here, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it comes down to it, I won\u2019t risk sending my client to prison. We\u2019ll plead insanity,\u201d Sam assured him.</p> <p>Evan still looked glum.</p><p>\u201cCheer up, I\u2019m not going down in an earthquake. I can win this, man. I won\u2019t take you off a cliff with me.\u201d</p><p>Evan still didn\u2019t look convinced. Actually, he looked like a young man whose older mentor had gone entirely senile.</p><p>Sam had to wonder if he was crazy himself.</p><p>When Jenna walked into A Little Bit of Magic that morning, both Cecilia and Ivy were working. After allowing her to get reacquainted with Ivy, following Ivy\u2019s massive, enthusiastic hug greeting, Cecilia finally asked the question it looked like she was dying to ask.</p><p>\u201cHey, how\u2019s it going with Malachi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlowly,\u201d Jenna admitted.</p><p>The shop was busy, but both the owners seemed to have the ability to have a conversation and keep an eye on their clientele, as well. Ivy hadn\u2019t gone with the completely black look as Cecilia had done; her hair was still a shaggy mix of brown and blond, colors that complemented her hazel eyes.</p> <p>\u201cWell, if you are trying to prove his innocence, that\u2019s going to be hard,\u201d Ivy said, making it obvious that the two women had discussed the situation.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Jenna told them, \u201cI came to ask you two a few questions about Wicca.\u201d</p><p>The warmth left Ivy\u2019s eyes. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to say that this is the result of witchcraft\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no! Not at all,\u201d Jenna assured them quickly. \u201cI know that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur beliefs aren\u2019t so different!\u201d Ivy said. \u201cAll gods and goddesses are part of the Source, and the source is like the one god of Christianity and Judaism and Islam. Catholics see saints\u2014we see other gods and goddesses. Praying in itself is important, as is the goodness that we are supposed to practice in everyday life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know\u2014honestly, I know,\u201d Jenna assured them. \u201cBut we all know that other people\u2014in any time\u2014can twist and contort what is supposed to be good and pure into other things, or try to make it appear that what is good\u2014isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>They both stared at her blankly.</p><p>\u201cThere is a horned demon, right?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>Ivy shook her head. \u201cNo demons. And no devils.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIvy, there is a horned god,\u201d Cecilia reminded her. \u201cBut he isn\u2019t evil. He isn\u2019t a devil. He is one of the oldest of gods. Many believe that his image has been drawn on walls by cavemen. He is...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is the connection between us and the earth, the wind, the sky, the greenery,\u201d Ivy finished, as though reading a pamphlet.</p><p>\u201cAh, but when you talk about people contorting things, he could easily be contorted,\u201d Cecilia told her. \u201cHe is often connected with images of the Green Man, and he is seen sitting with immense arms, embracing the heavens and earth, with a very erect phallus. He is the cycle, fertility, birth and the sexuality that is essential for rebirth.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Cecilia added, \u201cthough as far as I can tell none of the Witch Trial victims was a pagan, I can see how the prim and so-called proper people of the day would try to make him into a devil or a demon. Oh, he\u2019s considered the god of the underworld, so I suppose, in Christianity, that would make him the god of hell. You know\u2014he is represented with cloven hoofs and horns and all that.\u201d She shivered. \u201cPeople were so...easily scared!\u201d</p><p>Jenna smiled and agreed. \u201cWell, there were Indian raids, babies died, there was so little light...and they\u2019d been killing one another for decades and decades over religion on the Continent by the time the Pilgrims came here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you asking all this?\u201d Cecilia asked curiously.</p><p>Jenna wasn\u2019t about to explain to them that she\u2019d seen one, in postcognition\u2014murdering people. \u201cI\u2019ve seen one running around,\u201d she said.</p><p>Ivy groaned. \u201cYeah, yeah! And you\u2019ll see witches with warts on their noses, too. It\u2019s Halloween. A holiday for one and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, now, tolerance is what we need, and it\u2019s what we\u2019re all about,\u201d Cecilia reminded her.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, and if I ran around dressed like Jesus Christ or the Virgin Mary, people wouldn\u2019t be pissed at me?\u201d Ivy demanded.</p><p>Cecilia sighed. Before she could speak again, a woman walked politely up to them, excused herself, and asked about her psychic reading with Merlin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be right out,\u201d Ivy assured the woman. \u201cMerlin is excellent at keeping his appointment times, but he\u2019s very thorough. I know you\u2019ll enjoy your time with him, and that he\u2019ll be tremendously enlightening.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke, the man Jenna assumed to be Merlin came out of the curtained-off area in the back, followed by a young woman who seemed to be glowing.</p><p>She had certainly enjoyed her reading.</p><p>The man came toward them. He had long, curling brown hair, and was wearing a cape covered in stars and moons against a deep blue velvet background.</p><p>As he came even closer, Jenna realized she knew him and smiled. \u201cTommy! Tommy Wainscott!\u201d</p><p>He smiled as well and walked forward, giving her a hug and whispering, \u201cMerlin, please, if you will, Irish!\u201d</p><p>Tommy had gone to school with Cecilia and Ivy. They\u2019d all been friends. On her many visits to Salem, he\u2019d liked to tease Jenna a lot about the color of her hair.</p><p>\u201cMerlin!\u201d she said quickly.</p><p>\u201cMerlin,\u201d Ivy said, a dry edge to her voice. \u201cYour next appointment is waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d heard you were here,\u201d Tommy said, brown eyes dancing as he looked at her. \u201cWill I get to see you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cGotta go now! Business is good, but there\u2019s competition in town,\u201d he told her. He turned, thoughtfully rather than dramatically, to the young woman who was his next appointment. \u201cIf you will, please?\u201d He indicated the back.</p><p>Jenna smiled. \u201cSo Tommy is a medium now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very good,\u201d Ivy said.</p><p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d Jenna assured her.</p><p>\u201cHe can stand against any of them,\u201d Cecilia said. \u201cEven the new blood with the big boobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the new blood with the big boobs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha,\u201d Cecilia said.</p><p>\u201cOh? Samantha Yeager\u2014who wanted to buy the old Lexington place?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>\u201cThe one and only,\u201d Ivy said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s working at a shop down at the end of Essex Street. It\u2019s right next to Winona\u2019s Wine Bar. I think her people come in on the spirited side to begin with. Also, she gets lots of men who wouldn\u2019t step foot in with a medium if their lives depended on it otherwise...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. I\u2019m curious about her,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go for a reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerlin is much better!\u201d Cecilia assured her.</p><p>\u201cMuch!\u201d Ivy added.</p><p>Ivy frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re not into a different\u2014lifestyle these days, are you? I mean, it\u2019s absolutely fine with us. We love our friends no matter what their religion or whatever, including sexual likes.\u201d</p><p>Jenna smiled. \u201cNo, no lifestyle change. Just curiosity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s investigating stuff for the Lexington House murders, silly,\u201d Cecilia reminded her. \u201cBut, hey, we\u2019re curious as all get-out about Samantha, too! You\u2019ve got to come back and tell us all about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Jenna promised.</p><p>She left the shop and walked along the pedestrian mall. Haunted Happenings remained wonderfully in full swing. She noted a row of small buckets and saw that the town fathers had figured out how to have kids bob for apples in a more sanitary fashion than when she\u2019d been a kid. One mouth in a tub\u2014and then it was washed and refilled. The bobbing-for-apples crew\u2014attired in pirate gear\u2014was busy.</p><p>A medieval group had set up to sing and play a bit farther down, and one shop front boasted The Best Haunted House In All New England.</p><p>Still farther along, a busy group had children doing mock gravestone rubbings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was something for everyone.</p><p>At last she came to a shop where a large sign advertised Madam Sam, the Best Reading In All New England!</p><p>Not in Salem\u2014just like the haunted house, she was the best in all New England!</p> <p>She noted the wine bar next door and smiled.</p><p>Bells chimed when she opened the door to the shop. Like the other merchants, the store was enjoying the busy trade of Haunted Happenings. Men and women in and out of costume looked at beautiful dolls, herbs, gris-gris bags, magical stones, jewelry and clothing.</p><p>Jenna approached the counter and asked about a reading with Madam Sam.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re in luck!\u201d the girl behind the desk with black pigtails and a huge nose ring told her. \u201cA lady just became faint, and had to go back to her hotel. We\u2019re otherwise booked all day, so you are lucky, lucky, lucky!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow lucky indeed,\u201d Jenna murmured. \u201cThe woman is all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lady who was faint\u2014she was all right?\u201d</p><p>The girl waved a hand in the air. \u201cOh, her husband just took her back to her room. It\u2019s the Fates! You\u2019re the one who should have the reading!\u201d she said happily. \u201cCome along\u2014we have to adhere to a schedule, of course. You\u2019re ever so lucky!\u201d</p><p>Jenna followed the woman to the back and a setup that was similar to that at A Little Bit of Magic.</p><p>The clerk opened a heavy damask drapery for her and led her into the small cubicle where the medium was working.</p><p>Madam Sam was a beautiful woman. She was wearing a low-cut gypsy-style dress, and her hair was ink-black, long and sleek as it fell down her back. Her eyes were so blue they were almost violet, but Jenna could see, even by the dim light that added atmosphere to the cubicle, that the color had been enhanced with contact lenses. She wore very heavy makeup, especially around her eyes, adding to her look of the sexy gypsy reader.</p> <p>She wore a live boa constrictor around her neck; the animal somehow seemed to increase the size of her breasts and enhance her sensual mystique. There was something about her that seemed familiar, but Jenna couldn\u2019t quite put her finger on it.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Madam Sam said softly. \u201cWelcome. How curious that you have come to me for a reading!\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t offer Jenna a hand but instead indicated a chair in front of her table, which held a crystal ball and a large tarot deck.</p><p>Jenna said. \u201cYou know me? Have we met?\u201d</p><p>Madam Sam\u2014or Samantha Yeager\u2014laughed, a low, throaty and melodious sound. \u201cOf course I know you. Your name is Jenna Duffy, and you\u2019re attached to that delightfully devilish rogue, Sam Hall, and you\u2019re here to investigate the recent horrors that have occurred in Salem. Have we met? No, never, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d Jenna told her. \u201cI mean, we haven\u2019t met, but you do know exactly who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, and you work for the FBI,\u201d Madam Sam said.</p><p>\u201cOkay...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, yes, well, my other powers may be questionable, but I do read the local papers very well,\u201d Samantha said, grinning. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to pay for a reading to speak with me.\u201d Her voice had changed; it was tinged with amusement, and the sound was down-to-earth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to talk to you. And with all the business going on with Haunted Happenings, I thought I should seize this opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk away. We have fifteen minutes,\u201d Sam told her.</p><p>The boa stretched out toward Jenna.</p><p>\u201cNefertiti won\u2019t hurt you,\u201d Samantha assured her quickly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of snakes,\u201d Jenna told her.</p><p>\u201cGood old Saint Patrick got them all out of Ireland, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t she scare away costumers?\u201d</p><p>Samantha shrugged. \u201cSome, maybe. But I think she attracts more than she loses. It\u2019s all showmanship, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not a medium?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a medium, really? I talk to people, I try to understand them. I don\u2019t tell them that money is going to fall into their laps, or that they will find true love. What I do is try to draw out what is troubling them, and show them the directions they might take. I don\u2019t have any kind of a degree in psychology but, really, reading people is simple as long as you listen.\u201d</p><p>Jenna laughed softly. \u201cSome might call that being a fraud,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cAnd some might call it making a living. I\u2019m sure that some call you a fraud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, definitely,\u201d Jenna said, chuckling some more.</p><p>Samantha picked up the tarot cards and shuffled them. \u201cNot the tarot cards\u2014they come up as they come up, and a reader is supposed to interpret them. I\u2019ve studied the tarot and all the ways that the cards might be interpreted. So, shall we read the cards? Cut, please, and we\u2019ll use the Celtic Cross layout.\u201d</p><p>Jenna cut the cards and Samantha began to lay them out.</p><p>\u201cSo, what did you want to know?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to buy the Lexington House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. I still want to buy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you made an offer to Abraham Smith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very generous one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he turned you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlat.\u201d Samantha looked up at her. She was smiling. \u201cAnd you want to know if I killed the old man and his family\u2014except for the crazy kid\u2014to get my hands on the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore or less,\u201d Jenna admitted.</p><p>Samantha kept looking at her, still amused. \u201cNope,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou think that Malachi Smith is crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a loon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, do you think that he killed Peter Andres and Earnest Covington, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though the grocer swears he saw Malachi in his shop?\u201d</p><p>Samantha laid out cards before answering her, and then looked at her again. She sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not a cop or investigator or whatever, but I understand that the poor kid is truly a pathetic creature and I can also understand that you feel sorry for him. But you have to feel sorry for the dead people, too, the victims. Why kill Peter Andres? He was a farmer who substituted at the schools now and then. And Earnest Covington? He was harmless. You had to be crazy to have killed either of them, that\u2019s all I can imagine. Oh, dear!\u201d she said suddenly, looking down.</p><p>Jenna wasn\u2019t really familiar with tarot cards, but she saw that the horned god\u2014or, according to the cards, the devil\u2014had come up in the middle. She tried to recall what she did know of the tarot.... The card known as the devil was really a half god, half devil, and he represented what was in all men, and the fact that they had to choose to be slaves to the evil within, or to slip out of the chains that bound them.</p><p>Samantha looked at her and smiled. \u201cWell, seems you have a few options ahead of you. Give in to decadence, or hold the line of morality. If it were me\u2014I\u2019d sleep with the man!\u201d</p><p>Samantha had been intuitive enough on that one!</p><p>\u201cIt could mean, too, that there\u2019s both evil and goodness around me,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cOh, it could, but how boring! And look, you have the Fool over here\u2014ah, yes, so, moralistically, you are looking at others. How rude of you! Your Fool looks down upon the Devil, yet sees no evil in himself. And there\u2014you have the hanged man. At least it seems you are progressing and realizing the foolishness of judging what you see as evil in others. Sex, perhaps. Is that it?\u201d She looked curiously at Jenna.</p><p>Jenna didn\u2019t answer. She tapped another card. \u201cDeath, of course, means change?\u201d</p><p>Samantha laughed. \u201cOr death! Oh, come, I\u2019m sorry. Yes, it signifies change. But, without kidding you or just being bitchy\u2014really, forgive me\u2014the layout of these cards is almost...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA warning that if you judge others and pursue them, you will die.\u201d The look she gave Jenna was perplexing. \u201cYou seem like you\u2019re really nice. Yes, I\u2019m a fraud, but...maybe you need to be careful. You have the Devil, followed by Death.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, the cards seemed to leap from the table and fly across the room. Both women jumped back in their chairs.</p><p>And then they stared at each other accusingly.</p><p>\u201cI swear, I didn\u2019t do that!\u201d Samantha breathed, and the look she gave Jenna seemed both stunned and fearful.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>Samantha waved a hand in the air. \u201cYou\u2019ve asked your questions. Go, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have another question,\u201d Jenna told her, rising.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Samantha asked crossly.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you when the Smiths were killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy. I was right here\u2014ask the clerk!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Earnest Covington?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was probably right here!\u201d Samantha said, growing agitated as she started picking up her cards.</p><p>\u201cAnd Peter Andres?\u201d</p><p>Samantha stopped and stared at her. \u201cHow the hell would I know? That was six months ago! I had barely gotten to town. Look, please, this is how I make a living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Thanks,\u201d Jenna said. She slipped out from the curtained cubicle and walked to the counter to pay for her reading. She wasn\u2019t sure what she thought about Samantha Yeager. She was a woman who knew showmanship and how to use her assets. She knew it was all a game, as well. And yet...</p><p>She started looking at the jewelry in the glass case at the checkout counter and drew the young clerk with the huge nose ring into conversation. When they had chatted about the marvels of Madam Sam and Haunted Happenings, Jenna asked her, \u201cAnd Madam Sam has been working here since the Haunted Happenings began?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. How sad that none of the mediums in Salem thought to warn Abraham Smith that he and his family were about to be murdered,\u201d Jenna said, shaking her head with sorrow and leaving the shop.</p><p>\u201cMalachi, we know that when Earnest Covington was killed, the grocer, Mr. Sedge, saw you in his store,\u201d Sam said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut David Yates and his friend claim they saw you coming out of Mr. Covington\u2019s house,\u201d Sam reminded him. \u201cAre they still angry with you? Is that why? David believed, you know, that you had mind control over him and made him hurt himself.\u201d</p><p>Malachi had been tenderly cradling the acoustic guitar Jamie had just bought for him. The guitar was a modest piece of equipment, to be sure, but Jamie had been certain that it would make the time pass for the boy. He had strummed a few strings and listened in awe. And then, of course, he wanted to play with it.</p> <p>But now he paused, frowning and concerned. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t understand what happened at all. I had just gotten my tray. I saw David Yates and I knew he would try to knock it out of my hand or walk over and spit in my food. I was only looking at him to try and figure out the best way to back away from him. He stared back at me and started screaming\u2014and then he started beating himself in the head. And he begged me to stop! A bunch of his friends stared at him, and then at me, and then they came after me\u2014and I ran. I almost flew like a bird, I was so afraid. The school was in an uproar, and the cops came, but the kids had to admit that I hadn\u2019t touched him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were never anywhere near him,\u201d Sam mused.</p><p>\u201cHad you ever threatened David Yates?\u201d Jamie asked gently.</p><p>Malachi looked at Jamie with such confusion that Jamie might have been the one considered to be mad. \u201cMe? Threaten him? Never. Dr. Jamie, sir, look at me. And look at David Yates. He could rip me to shreds in a minute. And it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t know how to take a beating, and I know, God help me, that you turn the other cheek, but...no. No. I never threatened David Yates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he acting?\u201d Sam asked. The boys would have all been young teenagers at the time, all about fourteen. Still very impressionable. If they heard talk around town about Malachi\u2019s family, they might believe what they heard.</p> <p>\u201cNo, sir. I don\u2019t believe he was acting. He almost broke his own nose. And he was bawling. Tough guys like David aren\u2019t supposed to cry, I don\u2019t think,\u201d Malachi said. He paused, looking at the guitar again, forgetting Sam and Jamie for a minute. \u201cI cried. I cried so hard it hurt. But crying doesn\u2019t ease the pain when you lose somebody. It\u2019s just something that happens, and you can\u2019t really stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Malachi,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cPresident Lincoln was known to cry. He couldn\u2019t show tears to the country, but he cried when he lost his children, and he cried when he knew how many men were dying in the war. Men do cry.\u201d</p><p>Malachi nodded. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Sam knew that he had to find out more about David Yates, but he had been threatened, and though he wasn\u2019t afraid of threats, he wasn\u2019t going to lose a case over his own mistakes.</p><p>Jenna.</p><p>He thought grimly that he was really going to have to depend on her.</p> <p>He looked at Jamie. It was time that they headed back.</p><p>They rose. Jamie gave Malachi a warm hug, promising him that they\u2019d return.</p><p>Malachi shook Sam\u2019s hand.</p><p>They could hear him playing the guitar even as the door closed behind them.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Jamie asked.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get back to Salem,\u201d Sam told him. \u201cHave you talked to Jenna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Do you want me to call her?\u201d</p><p>Sam hesitated, surprised that he was afraid of sounding eager. \u201cWe\u2019re headed back. We can see if she wants to meet us somewhere for dinner.\u201d</p> <p>Jamie pulled out his cell and dialed. Sam waited.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not answering,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, we can call again on the way,\u201d Sam said. He didn\u2019t know why, but the missed call made him anxious.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t know that he was driving far too fast until Jamie said, \u201cSalem has been there hundreds of years\u2014I think it will wait for us. And Massachusetts, as you should know, can be fierce on speeding tickets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry Jenna again,\u201d Sam said, easing off on the gas pedal.</p><p>He thought that, when she didn\u2019t answer a second time, even Jamie looked concerned.</p><p>He decided to screw the thought of a speeding ticket.</p><p>Hitting the pedestrian area again, Jenna met insanity.</p><p>A group was coming from the wine bar, having imbibed quite a bit, and they were in a good mood as they tried to entice her to join them. Since one was in a clown outfit, she tried to escape by being equally jocular while assuring them she had to meet someone.</p><p>Escaping, she hurried around and up the hill toward the cemetery.</p><p>She looked at her phone and realized she had missed a call. Jamie. He\u2019d call back; they were probably heading home.</p><p>Dusk was starting to fall. Tourists were leaving and the gate was due to be locked. She passed the graves, and tried not to note the air of history that hung there, that whisper of darkness that seemed to carry the shadows of the deceased. It wouldn\u2019t be long before they came to close the gates, but she wandered into the cemetery and walked along the graves, aware of those around her, and respecting them with her silence. She noted the graves of little children, and she felt the pain of long-gone parents, laying their tiny babes to rest.</p><p>She walked along the stone wall to the rear of the cemetery and was startled to see a man in Puritan apparel in front of her, his features grim.</p><p>\u201cThe devil! The horned devil\u2014he is real, and he is coming for you!\u201d he warned her.</p><p>She blinked, not sure if she was seeing the past or the present, the image had become so very real and solid.</p><p>And then she turned.</p><p>In the place where a huge oak had grown right through the stones of the deceased, she saw something. Shadow.</p><p>Not shadow. It was far darker than the hazy figures of the dead.</p><p>It was real.</p><p>A lithe figure in a cape and cowl, wearing the mask of the horned god, stood in the cemetery.</p><p>It saw her as she saw it.</p><p>Like the grim reaper, it wielded a scythe.</p><p>And it started striding swiftly across the graves and the dead to reach her.</p><p>Jenna looked around\u2014it was just dusk, for God\u2019s sake! There were still people about.</p><p>They just weren\u2019t in the graveyard.</p><p>She could hear laughter from the street below. There were still plenty of people around; she didn\u2019t think that they had closed the doors to the wax museum, or the museum or shops across from it\u2014there would be people leaving those businesses, people casually walking the streets.</p><p>This was insane. The creature coming toward her with a scythe couldn\u2019t be serious. It had to be someone she knew, trying to give her a scare, or a college kid....</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t. And she knew it. This was the same figure she had seen walking in the pedestrian mall, the same figure that in her visions brutally murdered Peter Andres and then Earnest Covington.</p><p>As it came toward her, it suddenly began to swing the scythe, backward and forward, low along the ground, just as if it were mowing down long grass or stalks of corn.</p><p>The scythe made a whipping sound through the air, louder and louder the closer it came.</p><p>8</p><p>When they neared Jamie\u2019s house, Sam had Jamie put a call through to Jenna again. Still no answer.</p><p>Jamie swore, an unusual and colorful event. \u201cBy all the damnable banshees of the night! Why isn\u2019t that girl answering her phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you out. I\u2019ll keep looking,\u201d Sam said. \u201cCall me if she\u2019s in the house.\u201d</p><p>Jamie got out of the car. \u201cAye, and if she\u2019s not, I\u2019ll start around the common and the blocks around the Hawthorne.\u201d</p><p>Sam let Jamie out and tried cruising around on Church Street. There was no sign of her, but Essex Street was blocked off to everything but pedestrian traffic. As he tried to maneuver the streets, the going got difficult. Horrific murders might have recently taken place in Salem, but to the tourists flocking the area, the situation was in hand. The killer had been caught.</p><p>And, of course, they were tourists. They wouldn\u2019t be likely targets of a maniac who\u2019d only killed locals in his own realm thus far. Just as the mob had never really threatened the average Joe on the streets of Chicago or New York, visitors could allow themselves to feel safe.</p><p>Indians, pirates, crones, vampires and princesses walked into the streets against the lights, and he had to drive slowly and carefully.</p><p>His phone rang: Jamie.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not at the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019m parking. I can crawl faster than I can move in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have left the historic area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she armed?\u201d Sam asked Jamie.</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know,\u201d Jamie said.</p><p>\u201cAll right. We\u2019ll keep up.\u201d</p><p>He swore to himself\u2014far less colorfully than Jamie. He parked at the next opening. A tow-away zone. Screw the car.</p><p>He exited and headed for Essex Street, wishing he\u2019d made her give him an agenda, his heart pumping harder with every passing second.</p><p>Jenna figured she couldn\u2019t jump over the wall\u2014at the rear of the cemetery it was a huge drop down to the street below.</p><p>It occurred to her that she could confront her attacker. But the light from the streets flashing off the honed blade convinced her that she didn\u2019t have what was needed for such a thing.</p><p>She should have carried her gun. After the team had been made official\u2014proving themselves in New Orleans and learning that they could be a viable force together\u2014they\u2019d gone through the regular route of Federal training. She was good with a gun. She\u2019d been careful here, not carrying it, because she didn\u2019t want the police complaining to her superiors. Plus she wasn\u2019t entirely used to having it on her yet.</p><p>Not such a good plan, despite the finest of intentions....</p><p>The creature kept coming.</p><p>Keeping her eye on it, Jenna began a snakelike movement toward her right and the back of the museum that bordered the graveyard, using the cemetery\u2019s overgrown trees as a protection against the creature.</p><p>True panic gripped her when she heard the scythe being swung through the air, high this time. She felt it whizz by her, and then she heard a strange, hollow sound as it smacked against a headstone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Riddled with relief, she paused.</p><p>Plastic. The damned thing was plastic!</p><p>She turned and stood her ground, staring at the horned god for a minute. The figure was close, and she could now see that she was taller than the creature by a good two or three inches.</p> <p>She smiled.</p><p>It looked at her, and turned to run.</p><p>Jenna wasn\u2019t about to let this fool go. She sprinted after it, glad for the training she\u2019d been compelled to complete, it having taught her how to run well over uneven surfaces like the jagged line of standing and broken gravestones within the cemetery.</p><p>The masked figure turned back once and saw that she was almost upon it.</p><p>Jenna heard a yelp of panic.</p> <p>They were nearly back to the middle of the cemetery when she made a dive and tackled the creature.</p><p>\u201cOuch! Stop it! You\u2019re hurting me!\u201d</p><p>Jenna eased off and pulled the horned god mask off over his head. She looked down in the hazy light, and saw the least likely of assailants.</p><p>It was a kid. She estimated the boy to be thirteen or fourteen, a young teenager. He had a freckled face, and sandy red hair, a spattering of acne and a look of sheer terror in his brown eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think you were doing?\u201d Jenna demanded.</p><p>\u201cAw, come on, I was playing with you. A little scare for Halloween!\u201d</p> <p>Jenna stood and reached down a hand. The kid stood, and looked quickly to the side as if he was ready to bolt again.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, no, no! Who are you, what are you doing and who set you up to do this?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He made the slightest turn; she gripped his wrist in an iron vise.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d the kid wailed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere. I\u2019m getting the police.\u201d</p><p>A look of petrified alarm came to his face. \u201cNo, please! Please\u2014please, please don\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d better start talking.\u201d</p><p>She fumbled in her pocket for her phone. It wasn\u2019t there. Cursing, she tried not to let on that it was going to be difficult to carry out her threat.</p> <p>The graveyard was empty now except for the two of them\u2014and the hazy shadows that gathered around, anxious for excitement in their endless days and nights. Jenna kept her attention focused on the boy.</p><p>\u201cYou know who I am, don\u2019t you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He looked away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d she demanded, her fingers tightening again around his wrist.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said dully. \u201cYou\u2019re that whacked-out FBI lady who talks to ghosts\u2014and who wants to let a crazy killer out on the streets!\u201d</p><p>She gritted her teeth. \u201cNo one is going to let a crazy killer out on the streets. But you, young man, are an idiot. You\u2019re right. I am FBI. What if I\u2019d been armed? I might have taken a shot at you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s plastic!\u201d he protested.</p><p>\u201cYou meant to scare me. If you\u2019d scared me enough, plastic or no, I wouldn\u2019t have known, and I might have shot you. It\u2019s a damned good imitation of the real thing.\u201d</p><p>He was silent, his cheeks red. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d he pleaded.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d She\u2019d thought at first that it might be the bitter David Yates, or his comrade in accusation, Joshua Abbott. But this kid was too young to be either. Those two had to be seventeen now.</p><p>\u201cMy mom will probably kill me,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYour name and your mom\u2019s name, or I call the police. And I want to know why you\u2019re doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarty\u2014Martin Keller. And...I just did it because I hear them talking. All the adults in town are talking about you and that Mr. Hall. They\u2019re all angry. They say the cops have a killer and Mr. Hall is such a hotshot attorney he wants to prove that a crazy kid is innocent just because he can. He doesn\u2019t care if they let Malachi out on the streets, because he lives in Boston. And the rest of us will all be hacked up in our beds.\u201d</p><p>Jenna took a deep breath. \u201cWhat made you choose this costume?\u201d she asked, somewhat calmer.</p><p>He lowered his head. \u201cWe had it at the school for years. Every year, they do a play\u2014about the witchcraft trials, you know? And about the city now, and how we all have to learn to like each other, whether we\u2019re Jewish or witches or whatever. Nobody uses it after the first of the year. Nobody cares about it. I was going to put it back, honest, just as soon as Halloween is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s it? The costume was convenient?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a scary costume. Please\u2014scary, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>He looked away again.</p><p>She shook his arm. \u201cI can and will call the police!\u201d she warned. Well, she would\u2014when she found her phone.</p><p>He let out a long sigh of surrender and aggravation. \u201cOkay, I wanted to be a big shot. I wanted to tell the kids at school that I\u2019d made you pass out or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been chasing me?\u201d</p><p>He looked puzzled. \u201cWhat do you mean\u2014how long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many days?\u201d</p><p>His frown of confusion deepened. \u201cJust...just now. I saw when you left that shop\u2014I followed you after that, and barely no one was in the cemetery, and...I just meant to scare you and disappear, that\u2019s it, I swear it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you had the costume?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI just slipped it out of the drama room today, honest. I told the kids what I was going to do. You can ask\u2014they just finished their like once-a-year cleanup thing yesterday. I wouldn\u2019t have taken it before then. I\u2019da been caught.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him long and hard. He was starting to shake.</p><p>She was glad that he was afraid of her. He might be a couple of inches shorter, but she wondered how she\u2019d make out in a brawl with him. He was an adolescent starting to gain broad shoulders and a frame.</p><p>\u201cAre you on the football team?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah\u2014junior varsity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were trying to impress the seniors, huh?\u201d He squirmed.</p><p>\u201cLike David Yates and Joshua Abbott.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, that kid hurt David Yates. He really hurt him!\u201d Marty protested.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019d be big man on the field if you scared the FBI agent, huh?\u201d</p><p>He lowered his head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t get me in trouble. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are in trouble. Give me the costume. Get out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere? In the cemetery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. Now. It\u2019s not getting out of my sight. It\u2019s a cape and cowl, kid. You\u2019ve got to have something on beneath it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoxers and a T-shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re going home in boxers and a T-shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d he asked, his voice almost a whisper.</p><p>\u201cFind out if what you\u2019re telling me is the truth. And I\u2019m going to have this costume inspected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor blood, Marty, for blood,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s clean, I\u2019ll see that it gets back where it\u2019s supposed to be without anyone knowing. And if I find out that you\u2019ve told me the truth, then this whole event will be our little secret.</p><p>\u201cBut, Marty, if this was ever used to hurt anyone, there won\u2019t be anything I can do about telling the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hurt anyone!\u201d he protested, sliding out of the cape and handing it to her. At least, he was wearing decent boxers. On a beach, he might have looked ready for a swim.</p><p>\u201cJenna!\u201d</p><p>She whirled around at the sound of her name. Sam\u2019s voice. And there was a hint of panic in it, of relief\u2014and of anger.</p><p>Marty was going to use it as a chance to bolt. With her free hand, she caught his wrist again.</p><p>Sam leaped the little fence from the street side of the cemetery and came striding in.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell...?\u201d</p><p>He looked as if he wanted to pull her into his arms.</p><p>And shake her.</p><p>He eyed her hold on Marty, the costume in her hands.</p><p>\u201cMarty wanted to scare me,\u201d she said.</p><p>Sam seemed to tower over the boy. His shoulders were far broader, and he just had that look of Sam\u2014authoritative and something like a well-tailored and groomed bulldozer. \u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p><p>She thought that Marty would cry any minute.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll call the police,\u201d Sam said, reaching for his phone.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jenna said softly. \u201cWe\u2019ve already been through this. Marty and I have an agreement. I\u2019m going to get this costume to our lab, and find out if there is anything on it. Marty has apologized to me. He just borrowed the costume from the drama department today because he\u2019s heard how much we\u2019re loathed for what we\u2019re doing, Sam. Seems that most people believe that Malachi is guilty, and they want us to stop doing what we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>Sam stared at Marty. \u201cWhy this costume?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Marty said, his voice filled with exasperation and fear. \u201cIt was there. Every kid in town knows it. It\u2019s just a creepy costume and mask from our school events!\u201d he said.</p><p>Marty was shaking. Jenna was certain that he was repeating what he had heard the adults around him say over and over.</p><p>She almost felt sorry for him. And she was surprised when Sam spoke sternly but evenly.</p><p>\u201cMarty, think about it. What if Malachi is just different? If he\u2019s just a skinny kid who is super religious because that\u2019s the way he was raised. What if he didn\u2019t do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014but he did do it,\u201d Marty said.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know? How do you know that for a fact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen the TV. Hey, I know they all thought that he killed old man Andres\u2014and that Covington guy, too,\u201d Marty said. \u201cAnd then his crazy dad\u2014hey, we don\u2019t even blame him for killing his crazy dad, but he could kill us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know that he didn\u2019t kill Mr. Covington,\u201d Sam said flatly.</p><p>Marty shook his head. \u201cNo, no\u2014David and Josh, they said that he killed Covington.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMarty, David Yates is afraid of Malachi.

You\u2019re a smart kid. You don\u2019t believe in the \u2018evil eye,\u2019 do you?\u201d Sam asked him.</p> <p>Marty was confused and still very scared. \u201cI\u2014I...I don\u2019t know....\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him go for now,\u201d Jenna said softly. \u201cMarty needs to learn that everything he hears isn\u2019t true.

Jenna was no longer holding him.</p> <p>He turned and ran.</p><p>They watched him for a moment, and then Sam turned to Jenna. She thought for a minute that he was going to put his hands on her and shake her. He looked as if he wanted to do that, but with supreme effort refrained.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t you answer your phone?\u201d he demanded. \u201cI thought that something serious had happened to you. Your uncle is in a panic. Your uncle!\u201d</p><p>Without another word, he pulled out his own phone. He dialed Jamie, staring at Jenna.</p><p>\u201cFound her.\u201d</p><p>She could hear Jamie\u2019s reply. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the cemetery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine, Jamie. We\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t she answer her phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I lost it!\u201d Jenna said loudly. \u201cAnd I think probably in here\u2014probably against the back wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear that, Jamie?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cAye. I\u2019ll meet you at the new barbecue. It\u2019s two blocks from the graveyard. Lost her phone! Eh, my heart\u2019s not old enough for all this fibrillatin\u2019!\u201d</p><p>Sam pocketed his phone, staring at her. \u201cYou did just cost us about ten years of life, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSam, I dropped my phone. It\u2019s in here somewhere. I have to find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJenna, it\u2019s almost dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRetrace your steps.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and explained where she\u2019d been, not explaining exactly why. They split up by about twenty feet, trying to cover more ground.</p><p>\u201cYou should never be alone,\u201d he called to her.</p><p>\u201cOh, please, Sam! It was a kid trying to scare me, and I handled it.\u201d</p><p>Night was on them; the only light came from the street, and she wondered herself if she had a prayer in hell of finding her phone.</p><p>\u201cYou could ask the ghosts for help!\u201d he called.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I will!\u201d</p><p>She was surprised when she felt a soft touch on her arm.</p><p>It was a young woman. She had large eyes and soft flyaway hair, and she couldn\u2019t have been more than twenty years old when she had passed away. She managed a gentle smile and led the way.</p><p>Jenna found her phone against the back wall.</p><p>\u201cFound it!\u201d she called to Sam.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a miracle!\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, you know, a ghost helped me!\u201d she called cheerfully. \u201cOf course, if we were smarter, we could have just had you call it....\u201d</p><p>He came to her and took her arm. She wished she didn\u2019t get such a feeling of heat every time he touched her. She hoped her cheeks didn\u2019t redden, or if they did, that the shadows of the night hid her reaction.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d he said huskily.</p><p>\u201cSam, I want to get this costume to a lab right away. If we can find a twenty-four-hour FedEx or post office\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to head to Boston?\u201d he asked drily. \u201cYou know, the Massachusetts police aren\u2019t the Feds, but they are pretty damned good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam, I\u2019d have to explain that in my mind\u2019s eye, I see someone dressed like this killing people. And I\u2019d have to explain how I got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLegalese, Miss Duffy. I can work it out with John Alden. He\u2019s a good guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam, we may be letting loose of a piece of evidence\u2014\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cAnd you have no jurisdiction here at the moment. You weren\u2019t invited in. If the costume goes to an FBI lab and something is found, I might wind up with a chain of evidence issue in court, or a judge could find some other reason to have it thrown out. We\u2019ll just head to the station and call John.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, they heard the single wong of a siren. They had reached the low wall to the street; suddenly, a flashlight blazed into their faces.</p><p>\u201cGraveyard is closed! Gate locked. What are you two doing in there?\u201d An officer, his face shielded in the shadows cast by the glare of the light, demanded.</p><p>\u201cSorry! We were just leaving,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that you\u2019ve got?\u201d the officer demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a costume,\u201d Jenna offered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a serious offense here to tamper with the graves! To vandalize!\u201d the officer said angrily.</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t vandalizing!\u201d Jenna protested indignantly.</p><p>\u201cLook, hey, the gates were locked when we were in here!\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cBad enough dealing with kids and whackos during the season, but it\u2019s worse when wiseass adults are playing around in the cemetery!\u201d he said.</p><p>Sam looked at Jenna. \u201cOkay,\u201d he told the officer. \u201cTake us in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake you in?\u201d the officer was surprised. \u201cI wasn\u2019t arresting you\u2014I was giving you a serious warning. You\u2019re to come here to learn and have a good time and not destroy what is historic and can never be replaced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sam said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re doing a great job. Go ahead and bring us in, though. I\u2019ll call Detective Alden while we\u2019re on the way. He might just be sitting down to his supper.\u201d</p><p>John arrived right after Sam and Jenna had been seated in his office, in the middle of her call to Jamie. He was perplexed as to why it was so important to have the costume brought to the lab.</p><p>Jenna leaned forward to speak to John Alden, but Sam thought they were going to be in much better shape if he did the speaking.</p><p>\u201cJohn, bear with me on this. You\u2019re a good guy. You\u2019re really one of the good guys. And I know that you find it hard to believe that the evidence before your eyes is telling you the wrong story. I have a theory, and it may be crazy, but hear me out. No matter that you\u2019re only charging the boy for some of the murders, you think the same person killed everyone, and I agree with you. You believe it was Malachi Smith. I don\u2019t. And it\u2019s not just because I\u2019m defending him in court. I don\u2019t believe the kid did it. You\u2019re a cop, and yes, you work with the prosecutor. But prosecutors don\u2019t want to prosecute the wrong person. No officer of the court wants to be responsible for a miscarriage of justice. That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for here, John, justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy this costume?\u201d John asked, willing to listen to them but undeniably confused.</p><p>\u201cThe kid wearing it\u2014?\u201d He paused, looking at Jenna.</p><p>\u201cMartin Keller,\u201d she said. Her voice was tight, her jaw set. She wasn\u2019t happy with him. But they were playing on the same side in a precarious game, and she had to see that.</p><p>\u201cMartin Keller \u2018borrowed\u2019 the costume from the drama room. He was using it to scare Jenna. I believe that our killer is dressing up when he or she sets out to commit murder. It may be slim, but there is a possibility that the person is dressing up not just in a similar costume, but one borrowed from the drama department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe or she? You think it might be a woman?\u201d John said. \u201cThis much violence perpetuated by a woman is pretty rare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say it was a woman,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. But, yes, look back. In the Tate/LaBianca murders, Manson\u2019s stable of idol-worshipping followers were mainly women, and they were capable of extreme brutality. Karla Homolka seduced the victims when she and her husband went on a killing rage\u2014she was responsible for the rape and murder of her own sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you do think it\u2019s a woman?\u201d John asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, John, honestly, I don\u2019t know yet. I\u2019m just pointing out the fact that even if statistically men have committed more murders with this kind of violence, it\u2019s more than possible that a woman could be responsible,\u201d Sam said. He waved a hand in the air. \u201cAt this point, John, what I\u2019m trying to explain is this: wear a costume, and you\u2019re someone else. Wear a costume, and you can walk around unnoticed. Or even, wear a costume, and it might mean something specifically to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think they were ritual killings?\u201d John asked.</p><p>Sam lowered his head, fighting the frustration. \u201cI know that a kid in this costume tried to scare Jenna tonight. I know it comes from the school\u2019s drama department. I believe someone is wearing a costume like this\u2014an encompassing costume, one to hide identity\u2014to commit the killings. Please\u2014hey, Jenna wanted to take this to the FBI.\u201d</p><p>John stared at Jenna. \u201cThe FBI has not been invited in.\u201d</p><p>Jenna stood, irritated. \u201cWould it be such a bad thing? No one wants to take over. Obviously, we respect the Massachusetts police. No one wants to take charge of the investigation. But if you have help, please use it! Use us! The world is working on lower budgets. Why not charge a Federal lab? But Sam said that you were a good and honest cop and we could keep a chain of evidence. If you think we\u2019re just being silly, then please, give the damned thing back to me!\u201d</p><p>Sam noted that John just stared at Jenna for a moment, his jaw fallen. Then he smiled and looked at Sam.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the costume to the lab. I don\u2019t want a miscarriage of justice, Sam. I just can\u2019t believe that someone else has done all this. The kid was covered in blood. Covered. In. Blood. But I won\u2019t have it be said you were denied anything in the right to defend your client.\u201d He pointed at Sam. \u201cYou two chose not to call the police, and the costume is in your hands. So as long as we\u2019re being \u2018unofficial\u2019 about everything, you see to it that school is afforded a new costume. And I\u2019ll see to that Martin Keller is\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jenna started to move forward again.

Thanks, John.\u201d</p><p>He herded Jenna out, and then remembered he didn\u2019t have his car. \u201cUm, John, a ride to my car, if possible?\u201d</p><p>The same officer who had come upon them at the cemetery drove them to Sam\u2019s car.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cTow zone, Mr. Hall, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d the officer pointed out. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to pick it up until tomorrow. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to pay that fine, too.\u201d</p> <p>Sam was ready to explode. He didn\u2019t give a damn about the fine, but he did love his car. It made coming and going the distance so much easier.</p><p>It was a material object, he reminded himself.</p><p>Yeah, but it was his material object. He\u2019d always loved cars. He\u2019d mowed lawns for his car, painted, hauled trash, worked hard. He couldn\u2019t help it; he just really loved cars. He spent a lot of time in his car; it was a place he often spent a lot of time just thinking and calculating his arguments.</p><p>\u201cI can drop you somewhere else,\u201d the officer told him.</p><p>\u201cYou can drop me at the foot of Essex,\u201d Jenna told the officer. \u201cI think that Sam is just going to stand here and stare at the spot where his car used to be.\u201d</p><p>She got back into the police car. Sam shook his head. \u201cRight. I\u2019m going to stand here.\u201d He tapped on the hood. \u201cGo.\u201d</p> <p>He watched as the car drove away, and then he kicked the ground. Damn it. He\u2019d been frantic over her, and now, because of it, his car had been towed.</p><p>She lost her phone in the cemetery while accosting the kid who had tried to scare her. What the hell was she doing in the cemetery again\u2014communing with her ghosts? And she was flipping pissed off at him because he\u2019d stopped her from speaking so that he could get a rational argument through to John Alden.</p><p>But she was safe. That was worth a car being towed. Well, of course. Logical and ethical. Human life was always the most precious commodity. When life was gone, it could not be returned.</p><p>It was more than that.</p><p>Tense and angry, he walked back toward his own house. He didn\u2019t find the streets all that charming at the moment; partygoers were out, dispersed among families, just trying to find a place for dinner before settling back into their bed-and-breakfast inns or hotel rooms for the night. There were endless balls in Salem as Halloween approached. Some private, some sponsored by the Wiccans, some sponsored by frat houses and sororities. It was true that every manner of costume known to man could be seen in the city.</p><p>As he walked, he turned back to look at a rowdy crowd of fraternity boys. They were all dressed up as Greek heroes.</p><p>A Warrior Princess Xena was following in their wake; she must have been freezing her...assets off. The night had definitely grown chill.</p><p>He frowned suddenly, stopping dead in his tracks. Just behind Xena Warrior Princess was someone else who didn\u2019t belong in the crowd of Greeks.</p> <p>Someone in a Celtic costume\u2014that of the horned god, or the goat god. He started walking toward the group. The warrior princess cried out as she was pushed by the horned god, falling over and only just being saved from a hard meeting with the pavement because Sam was there in time to catch her.</p><p>\u201cRude asshole!\u201d one of the Greeks called out. \u201cThanks\u2014\u201d he began to say to Sam, but Sam was already moving through the crowd.</p><p>He saw the horned god, and he took flight after it once again. The horned god turned and saw him, and slipped back into a crowd of princes, princesses, a frog and one Freddy Krueger. Bert and Ernie and the Count from Sesame Street took up most of the sidewalk.</p><p>By the time he made his way through the cartoon menagerie, the horned god was gone.</p><p>He stood, puzzled. It was a common costume, especially in Salem. At one time, surely, the Christian church had mistaken the Celtic goat god or horned god for the devil, and thus the creature of decadence had become something like evil incarnate.</p><p>Pictures of the horned god adorned many of the museums dedicated to explaining what might have happened to cause the Salem Witch Trials.</p><p>So why run? Why run away in the costume because Sam had seen him?</p><p>Because Jenna was right?</p><p>Feeling uneasy, still angry, angrier with himself because he\u2019d allowed himself to get caught up in it all and angrier still because...</p><p>She did something to him. It wasn\u2019t like the simple burst of hormones, wanting a beautiful woman. That would be too easy. True, he thought. Men could be ruled far more easily from below the belt. But that was easy, simple. I want you; do you want me, too? His life had been gifted, too many appetites easily achieved.</p><p>This...this was a different kind of hunger. Not the kind that was easily appeased, and not the kind that he could walk away from and...</p><p>He didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>Sam Hall. Oh, yeah, the clever one. Sometimes you\u2019d need to intimidate\u2014investigate. Become a P.I. Size mattered, psychologically, face-to-face with someone in a courtroom. Remember to go to the gym. Join the defense\u2014remember to win.</p><p>Fall for a red-haired Irish lass and...</p><p>\u201cAh, yes,\u201d he said softly aloud. \u201cBurn in hell!\u201d</p><p>He reached his house. Inside he shed his trench coat and stripped haphazardly as he headed into the shower. Cold first, cold as ice, and then hot, the kind of water to knead the tension out of his muscles.</p><p>It worked on his muscles, not on his mind.</p><p>Death. Death was what you couldn\u2019t take back. You could argue, you could rail. You couldn\u2019t win against death.</p><p>He\u2019d learned that.</p><p>And then, tonight, when she hadn\u2019t answered her phone...</p><p>FBI agent. Competent. Trained.</p><p>Competent, trained people, veteran cops and marshals and soldiers all fell when they were ambushed, unadvised, unwary.</p><p>He heard his doorbell ring as he turned off the water. Frowning, he slipped into his terry robe and padded barefoot to his bedroom. He kept his Smith &amp; Wesson in the drawer next to his bed. With all that was going on, if someone was ringing his bell at night, he was going to the door armed.</p><p>He looked through the peephole and felt all the tension he had just tried to ease from his body slam right back into it with a searing sensation of heat.</p><p>9</p><p>As she stood on her toes to see if she could actually look in the peephole, Jenna saw that it darkened. Sam had come to the door.</p><p>It swung open. He stood there, still damp from the shower, wrapped in his robe, feet bare, a rigid and wary look on his face and a gun in his hand.</p><p>\u201cHey, I come in peace!\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI doubt that,\u201d he said drily, turning from her. \u201cIf you\u2019re coming in, lock the door behind you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d headed off toward one of the rooms to the right side of the stairway. Jenna walked into the foyer and stood uncomfortably, then turned and locked the front door.</p><p>Had she come in peace?</p><p>Not really.</p><p>Why had she come?</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to answer her inner turmoil; he reappeared, the gun now gone. Her heart was fluttering and she couldn\u2019t seem to breathe correctly, and worst of all, it felt as if there were a burning sensation that stirred in the center of her core and shot down her thighs.</p><p>Disgraceful, good God! Sex, desire, they were all human instincts, and all kept under control in a civilized society, and...</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you want?\u201d he asked flatly.</p><p>What do I want?</p><p>The dead blunt question took her by surprise. She was disappointed that she couldn\u2019t quite lay it on the line.</p><p>You.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a jerk,\u201d she said.</p><p>Good beginning.</p><p>\u201cThis couldn\u2019t have waited until tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She walked over to him and shoved him on the chest. \u201cNo, it can\u2019t. You almost put your arm down my throat to make sure that I didn\u2019t speak this afternoon. What? You were afraid that I would just sit there and blurt out to the repressed New England cop that I see and speak to ghosts and that I can also relive certain experiences sometimes by being somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She laid her hand against her own breast. \u201cI am a Federal officer, Sam Hall, with all the rights that go with that title, and I did all the running, jumping, history, science and arms training that went along with becoming official. I worked hard, and I\u2019m real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just see ghosts,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t anything in your life been anything other than a Jaguar? Oh, probably a tailored suit!\u201d she mocked. \u201cGuess what? You can\u2019t take them with you. You, me, everyone dies, Sam. And sometimes there\u2019s a pain, a loss, something that can\u2019t quite let you go. And you know what? Those left behind are here because of their hearts and their souls, things you can\u2019t see in the living. Good God, I\u2019d never expect you to see them in the dead! You see nothing that isn\u2019t completely tangible, nothing that makes the rest of us human! And, for your information, Mr. High-and-Mighty bring-in-the-big-money Hall, I\u2019ve done a hell of a lot more toward finding out the truth in this case than you have. And\u2014\u201d she came toward him again, poking a single finger at his chest \u201c\u2014you mark my words, the killer was wearing a horned god costume!\u201d</p><p>He caught her by the shoulders then, his hands not rough, but something of force about him as he backed her against the wall. \u201cYou listen! You came to me to defend a kid covered in a blood\u2014the kind of evidence that leaves the prosecution dancing in the streets. You can\u2019t begin to imagine all the motions that had to be filed, and you still can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s going to be like to find the right jury, and most of all, how dare you? I don\u2019t speak to the dead\u2014dead is dead and gone, and therefore, no! They don\u2019t answer questions for me, not in a court of law. I believe the last time that was tried innocent people were killed for \u2018witchcraft.\u2019 And if you\u2019re so brilliant and precious and understand the psyche of everyone living and dead, why the hell haven\u2019t you just asked Abraham Smith who the hell it was who murdered him?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stared back at him, speechless for a minute.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that.

And then she noted the look in his eyes, and he was suddenly close against her and she could feel the damp fire of the length of him, and she opened her mouth to speak but she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to try to explain anything to John tonight, that\u2019s true. But I was behind you. Whether I believe or understand or not, I was behind you. And you\u2019re not really angry with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d</p> <p>He lowered his head and found her mouth. His lips captured hers, and his kiss was firm and coercive, his mouth forming over hers with a liquid fire, desire seeming to burn in the very way that he touched her. She felt the incredible vitality and supple strength of the length of him as he pressed her there against the wall, and she was grateful for the wall, thinking that, for her, it had been far too long since she had let herself even begin to feel such sensation.</p><p>His tongue moved into her mouth, again strong and coercive and seductive, and she was even more grateful that he pinned her there. This was what she had wanted, yes, but she hadn\u2019t imagined that she would feel so deliriously weak, and so at a disadvantage. He was a good lover, she thought, because he was a practiced lover; she had seen from the beginning that he moved with a confidence and ease that meant he would hold everything an alpha male held, power unto himself, the physical arrogance that was undeniably attractive. She felt like an inexperienced teen again, unsure and uncertain, and afraid she was far out of her league.</p><p>His lips broke from hers, and his mouth remained just inches away, but she could see his eyes again, and she was stunned that they seemed to be a clear gray, hiding nothing, offering something that might have been honesty and even humility.</p><p>\u201cIs this why you came?\u201d he asked hoarsely. \u201cBecause, dear Lord, I think I might have simply burned to a cinder, longing for you and not knowing how to even begin to ask.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, not trusting her voice, and felt the brush of the back of his fingers on her cheek. She was astonished to see that his fingers trembled.</p><p>She moved against him, burying her face against his chest, then lifting her head and finding his mouth again. She felt his arms around her, lifting her more tightly against him, and through clothing and terry, she could feel the rise of his sex, he was so instantly aroused. She slipped her hands beneath the terry of the robe, fumbled at the belt, and drew more flush against him. He backed away, and together they pulled off her sweater, and she realized then that his clothing was strewn about. She looked at him, puzzled for a moment.</p><p>\u201cCold shower when you left me!\u201d he told her.</p><p>And she found that she could laugh, and crashed into his arms again. It seemed that they couldn\u2019t kiss enough at first, delirious wet kisses that seemed both too much and somehow necessary between them, and then he began to half lead and half carry her into the bedroom on the side of the house, and they fell together onto the large canopy bed there. Jenna got one boot off before he pulled her back down, and she let the other go. Their mouths met again, and his lips trailed to her throat and her shoulders while his fingers eased around to her bra strap. She ran her hands down the length of his naked back, trembling and hungry and yet wanting every minute, every sensation that led to the pent-up desire she\u2019d been so eager to suppress. His hands and mouth covered her flesh, and he was amazingly giving in all that he did, as if he were fascinated beyond measure by every aspect of her skin, every inch....</p> <p>She touched him as he touched her, running her hands down his midriff, taking it farther, wrapping her fingers around his erection and bringing a gasp from his lips. \u201cNot fair, I was half-naked already,\u201d he whispered, rising above her. For a moment she caught the silver-gray glint of his eyes in the shadows cast into the darkened room by the hallway light, and she was mesmerized by the dusky shade of the room that seemed to envelop them in some kind of ridiculously magical realm. Could she be so abandoned in bright light? She didn\u2019t know, but she reached out, taking him to her when he moved down to kiss her lips again and then inch down the length of her body, kissing, caressing and stroking while he found the waistband to her jeans and shimmied the denim down her body and, at last, rid her of her last boot, the last vestige of clothing.</p><p>And then he rose above her, looking down at her again. He lowered himself, lacing his fingers with hers, and eased himself into her, pausing, and then moving, and moving again, more deeply and deeply, until it seemed that his trust shot through to her heart, and her body\u2014core and limbs\u2014became electric in themselves. She moved against him, arms around him, legs entwined around his back, and she marveled at the miracle of sensation and sensuality and sex, because it was magic, and she\u2019d left the world behind, wanting nothing but the touch, scent and taste of him, and the writhing, undulating, wet, slick movement between them.</p><p>She climaxed with a desperation that left her body drained. She felt him expulse, felt his arms around her tighten, and she felt his weight, and then the way he eased down beside her, and brought her back into his arms again. The drumbeat of their hearts seemed ridiculously loud in the room, and the bed\u2019s comforter seemed cool, and still her body seemed to be on fire.</p><p>And for a moment, she winced inwardly. It was sex, just sex.</p><p>But she liked him so much; she didn\u2019t want to...</p><p>She did. She was fascinated by the way he moved, and the way he thought, and the tone of his voice, and his little idiosyncrasies, the way he paced and put his hands in his pockets, thought out his words and didn\u2019t think out his words....</p><p>For a moment, she must have eased away.</p><p>He pulled her back, his voice husky. \u201cCome here, Red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please! Don\u2019t call me Red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, come here, Irish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me Irish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it bad to be Irish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you come on over here, Puritan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch, ooh. That one does hurt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>He rolled up on an elbow to look at her. \u201cJenna. Come here, please, Jenna. Please, don\u2019t think about leaving me yet. I\u2019m begging you.\u201d</p><p>She eased back against him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t leaving,\u201d she said. \u201cNot now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should just stay. I can call Jamie\u2014\u201d</p><p>She rose out of his arms onto her elbow and stared down at him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to call my uncle and tell him that I\u2019m staying the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than have him worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was almost a priest!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Almost a priest. The key word there is almost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie is human, Jenna.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and lay back down by him. He pulled her against him. \u201cHe\u2019s my uncle,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure he knows that you grew up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019ll take you home. He\u2019ll think we\u2019re assuming that he\u2019s either stupid or entirely blind himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t work,\u201d Jenna told him.</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cI really can\u2019t stay long. Of course, we could be discussing the case, should be discussing the case\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, definitely not. Not now, not here!\u201d he whispered, and pulled her against him again.</p><p>This time, he was achingly, deliciously slow, teasing and tormenting, and she struggled to do so in return. When they were spent at last, she collapsed next him, ridiculously glad to know him so well and so thoroughly. She wasn\u2019t sure where it could lead, and she couldn\u2019t allow herself to care. It was now, and it was still magic, and she\u2019d never regret having come here, because somehow, on this night, no matter what aspects of philosophy and life divided them, they were one for those few hours.</p><p>They lay there entwined as seconds ticked by. Then, rather than Jenna, it was Sam who rose, and after a minute, he returned to stand in the doorway. She couldn\u2019t help thinking that he was something like an indifferent Adonis, unaware of himself. She wondered if he had any idea of just how perfect he might be; in his world, his tailored clothing was his mask.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all set,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She leaped out of the bed. \u201cAll set for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called Jamie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you asked him if I could stay the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I said you were here, safe, with me, and I was about to walk you back, and he said that we should both just get some sleep and he\u2019d see us in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>\u201cI swear, God as my witness,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure you believe in God,\u201d she said.</p><p>He stood there a moment. \u201cI do believe in...something. A greater power. I believe in life, and all that goes with it. I even believe in people, and that love itself is one of the greatest powers on the earth. The things I\u2019ve seen done when love is real are remarkable. And, anyway, on all that, I swear, it was Jamie\u2019s idea that you stay.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He walked to her, taking her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she murmured.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I mean, I\u2019m really starving, although, of course...all my creature desires seem to be calling to me at once.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and stepped away. \u201cGot another robe?\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t much in the house despite their attempts to concoct something substantial from the meager pickings. Sam found a takeout menu from a pizza restaurant that delivered as late as two in the morning, so they sent out for pizzas. There was enough for a salad, which they had just managed to finish putting together when the pizza arrived. They sat at the kitchen table with a bottle of sauvignon and their food, and Jenna found that she couldn\u2019t help but bring up the case again.</p><p>\u201cI feel we have the answer, as if we\u2019re looking right at it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSo far, we know that a number of people like to dress up as the horned god, and that they probably do so because the teaching facilities use that likeness to show why the Puritans were easily led to believe that Celtic religions and paganism did have a devil. And since the Puritans were busy getting rid of Calvinism\u2014by any means necessary\u2014and were supposed to be the most amazing fundamentalists, they could be convinced easily enough that there was a devil, and, at first, that those who weren\u2019t good churchgoers might easily dance with the devil. Midwives and healers were always the first suspects.\u201d</p> <p>Jenna drummed her fingers on the table. \u201cYes, but Rebecca Nurse was accused by the girls, and she did hang, and she was an extremely noble woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d he said, waving his fork at her. \u201cThere were two main families who held the money in the town at the time\u2014they didn\u2019t seem to be against money. It was the Porters and the Putnam family. Okay, they were a little messed up and inbred by then, but it seemed that each section of the families had to side with one of the families. The Putnams were throwing out the accusations\u2014Rebecca Nurse was on the Porter side.</p><p>\u201cIt all started with Tituba, the slave from Barbados, telling tales. Tituba was different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs Malachi is different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I guarantee you, John Alden\u2014and many other fine people in this city\u2014are not going to let people run around crying, Witch!\u201d</p><p>Jenna shook her head. \u201cNo, but we saw tonight that children listen to their parents. Okay, maybe not when the parents want them to, but they definitely listen to adult conversation. The Smith family was disliked. Many people felt sorry for Malachi\u2014they hated his father. But the family itself was hated. So, that made Malachi different. Then there was the incident with David Yates. Okay, logically\u2014and yes, I believe this\u2014 David was afraid in his own mind and hit himself in the head. Sam, that was like the girls twitching and crawling around the floor and speaking in so-called tongues. They were afraid. Tituba told the girls stories. David had been cruel to Malachi, and he\u2019d heard that the family was fanatical.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI agree. It\u2019s a sound correlation. But here\u2019s the thing. I believe, and if you\u2019re right about the murderer wearing a costume, the murders were well planned, as well. And if that\u2019s the case, they were well planned to make it look like Malachi was the murderer. That doesn\u2019t go along with hysteria,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s all a combination of both,\u201d Jenna suggested.</p><p>\u201cAnd the past,\u201d Sam said thoughtfully. He smiled at Jenna across the table. \u201cSomebody wanted something, so they were using prejudices that were already there to accomplish what they wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut who\u2014and what do they want?\u201d Jenna asked thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cThe diamond answer,\u201d Sam said. He looked at her. \u201cSomehow, now, you have to get to see David Yates, and I have to find a way to talk to Joshua Abbott. We have to get them apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Oh! Oh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What?\u201d</p><p>Jenna grinned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014I forgot to tell you. I went and had my tarot cards read yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went by A Little Bit of Magic. I spoke to Ivy and Cecilia, and saw another old friend, now known as Merlin. Anyway, they said he had competition\u2014 Madam Sam. Who is Samantha Yeager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe gave you a reading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but she already knew who I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally\u2014why bother with the reading? And what did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said that she didn\u2019t kill anybody over a house, basically. She\u2019s interesting. And she had an alibi\u2014as far as killing the Smith family, anyway. The clerk verified that she had been giving tarot readings when they were killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should meet her,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cYes, you should. She\u2019s interesting. I mean, very theatrical. But she admits it\u2019s all an act. I think she\u2019s entirely different when she\u2019s not being Madam Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, I\u2019ll go and have a tarot card reading.\u201d He paused a moment, looking at her before speaking softly. \u201cThen I think that we have to go back to the murder house again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLexington House?\u201d Jenna asked. She felt as if her skin crawled with the thought of it. She wasn\u2019t afraid of the house, she told herself. The house was a shell.</p><p>A shell that had witnessed terrible cruelty and violence.</p><p>\u201cIf you can,\u201d he said. He set his hand on hers. \u201cJenna, I don\u2019t want you to do anything that hurts you in any way. I still don\u2019t know what I believe, but you were practically bleach-white the last time we were in there, and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I do,\u201d she told him. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. You\u2019ll be there, too.\u201d</p><p>He stood up, finishing the last swig of his wine. \u201cWe do need to get some sleep,\u201d he said, setting down his glass and reaching for her hand.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to sleep?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cEventually.\u201d</p><p>Jenna was startled awake by the very loud ringing of her phone.</p><p>She groped blindly for it, remembered her handbag was in the foyer where she had dropped it, and bolted from the bed.</p><p>Sam was already up. He had showered and was dressed, and she could smell the delicious aroma of freshly brewed coffee.</p><p>He handed it to her as she came dashing out.</p><p>\u201cWow, I do like the way you look in the morning!\u201d he teased.</p><p>She gave him a warning glance, dived into the bag and found her phone.</p><p>She answered with a quick, \u201cDuffy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJenna.\u201d</p><p>It was Angela Hawkins, Jenna\u2019s team member, and one of her favorite people in the world. Angela had been a cop before joining the unit, and though she was a slim, blue-eyed blonde, she really was tough as nails. She was also wonderful at making contact with whatever spirits might remain behind.</p><p>\u201cAngela! Hey, how are you? Is everything all right? Oh, please, I hope we don\u2019t have to be somewhere right now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Jackson thought we should come up. Unofficially, of course. So, we\u2019re just here for Haunted Happenings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re at your uncle\u2019s house\u2014Jackson, Will and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! You\u2019re in Salem already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Actually, Will has a permit\u2014we\u2019re sending him out to perform magic in the street and he can see what passes by\u2014we\u2019re going to put him just outside one of the museums on the pedestrian walkway. Anyway, should we come to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Ah, no,\u201d Jenna said, glancing at Sam, who had poured her coffee and brought it to where she stood. \u201cNo, fifteen minutes, we\u2019ll be there. Sam and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time. Jamie is filling us in.\u201d</p><p>She hung up, feeling panicked, and then laughed.</p><p>\u201cIs that hysteria? What\u2019s going on?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cJackson, Angela and Will are here. Part of my team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackson Crow\u2014the behavior guy. The profiler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngela and Will, too. She was a cop in Virginia...and Will was an entertainer, from Trinidad, originally\u2014fascinating guy. He works with film and sound and all that. He\u2019s going to do surveillance down by the shops and museums on the pedestrian walk, pretend to be a street performer doing magic.\u201d</p><p>She was afraid for a minute that he was going to be angry\u2014afraid that his rapport with John Alden would be destroyed if the FBI showed up.</p><p>\u201cBrilliant,\u201d he said. \u201cA worker who can see a zillion tourists, of course, but also get to know all the people in the area\u2014shopkeepers, guides, Puritan and Witch Trial actors and actresses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliant? You\u2019re sure?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI liked your speech to John Alden the other day. We will happily use what we can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about John? Will he become defensive?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see. Hey\u2014they\u2019re here, right? And it\u2019s a free country. They don\u2019t have to have police cooperation to be here and look around a tourist city as private citizens.\u201d</p><p>She let out a sigh of relief and took a long swallow of coffee. \u201cA shower. I\u2019ve got to get into the shower...my clothes! I need both boots, oh, hell....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a shower in the back of the bedroom, in the bath, extra toothbrushes and stuff like that in the cabinet above the sink, and...\u201d he said, caught her arm before she could tear off and kissed her lips quickly. \u201cDon\u2019t panic. Sex is older than the hills, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not panicked. I\u2019ve just got to move!\u201d</p><p>He laughed as she hurried away.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Sam and Jenna had walked the short distance to Jamie\u2019s house.</p><p>Since he\u2019d met Jenna, Sam had found himself intrigued to meet Jackson Crow. The man was about his own height and build with exceptional features that told of a Native American background. Angela was a slim, stunning blonde with grave eyes, and Will Chan was tall with a fascinating mix of cultures, predominately Asian, visible in his features, as well. They seemed relaxed and easy, but ready to hear everything they could about the case. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be discreet,\u201d Jackson assured Sam. \u201cNo problems with the locals. We can just be your legs or eyes as needed\u2014you can\u2019t be everywhere at once. And we can send any questions straight to Jake Mallory. He can find out about any human being in the world, and he can do it legally. Most of the time. I believe.\u201d</p><p>Will had given Jenna an affectionate kiss on the cheek, as had the others, when they had met. Sam was surprised to realize that he felt a twinge of jealousy\u2014this was a team that was tight and supportive. He was accustomed these days to doing most of his own work in his head, arguing out plans and actions by himself, despite the fact that Evan Richardson was such a great assistant. He\u2019d come up in the world; sometimes he missed the early days when he\u2019d been in the D.A.\u2019s office himself and he\u2019d sat in a pool with others, all searching out legal histories and planning stratagem. Not to mention the larger group\u2014being friends with the cops instead of being considered a thorn in their sides, as a defense attorney often was.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, I start right away,\u201d Will said, rising and shaking Sam\u2019s hand. \u201cI have my cell, and it\u2019s on buzz.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get in for a guest performance at the school. We\u2019ll see how that goes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe I can help with that,\u201d Sam said. He hadn\u2019t told Jenna, of course, but he believed her angry speech about law enforcement being open to whatever help there was might have given John Alden a twinge. Maybe John even believed\u2014just a little\u2014that he wasn\u2019t in the right. Or, at least, that Sam\u2019s involvement\u2014and Jenna\u2019s\u2014could only help to prove Malachi\u2019s guilt. And if he couldn\u2019t pull this one off, he knew who could. \u201cJamie!\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t you still take cases from the school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. But I\u2019m assuming that I\u2019m not particularly loved there at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all know how I feel about Malachi\u2014that he\u2019s being railroaded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but most people are basically decent, even when they\u2019re swayed by a common concept,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI think you should go in first.\u201d Jamie nodded.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019m heading out,\u201d Will said and left them.</p><p>Jackson asked Sam, \u201cWhat about getting back into Lexington House?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to John Alden. He\u2019s the lead detective on the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, what can we do?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>Sam went over everything that he and Jenna had discussed the night before. Jackson listened attentively. \u201cI have to ask this\u2014do you honestly believe that the young man is innocent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cI believe in him and, Jackson, when you meet him, you\u2019ll believe in him, too,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cThere\u2019s something...I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s special. And I don\u2019t mean that in any kind of a negative way. His belief is so strong. And antiviolent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d Sam said, \u201cthat Andy Yates would definitely be someone to get to know better. He was interested in purchasing the house, and it\u2019s his son who was involved in the altercation or whatever with Malachi. I still want to talk to his son, David Yates\u2014and the friend, Joshua Abbott\u2014who agreed that they\u2019d seen Malachi rush out of Earnest Covington\u2019s house. Their statements directly contradict those of the grocer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI spoke with the grocer,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s adamant about what he saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the boys are lying,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cAt the moment I\u2019ve got them on hold, but this has to change now. However, Andy Yates\u2019s wife threatened me not to get near the boy,\u201d Sam said. \u201cAs the defense attorney I do have the right to speak with the witnesses. I\u2019ve been trying to think of a way around that. I\u2019d rather not walk in pulling out the official card, just yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and we can\u2019t compromise the case in any way,\u201d Jackson said thoughtfully. \u201cBut it\u2019s not compromising the case if it\u2019s the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is the law, and I can argue the issue\u2014but only if the prosecution is calling him in. If David Yates is going to be a witness, I can get a court order for the kid to talk to me,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI was hoping not to force the issue, since people talk more easily when they\u2019re not forced to do so. And then there\u2019s this\u2014so far, Malachi has only been accused of the murders of his family. If the prosecutor doesn\u2019t press further charges and doesn\u2019t intend on bringing further charges against Malachi and bring David Yates into court, I won\u2019t have any standing. But, still, I\u2019m hoping I could sway them to drop the prosecution if they can see the other two murders were done by someone other than Malachi. I think that should work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kids are always hanging out at the cliff park-that\u2019s-not-really-a-park,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cMaybe I can show Angela the view, and we can hope the boys wind up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Sam said. \u201cYou two try the cliff after school. I\u2019ll take Jackson with me. I\u2019ll introduce him to Councilman Yates, then we\u2019ll take a ride over to Beverly. I still think someone at the church Abraham Smith was attending might know something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re forgetting something,\u201d Jenna told him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cSamantha Yeager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, well, we definitely need to have our cards read!\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>After they discussed arrangements to get Sam\u2019s car and get everyone where they needed to be, Sam noticed Jenna seemed to be getting a touch antsy. \u201cWhat are you going to do before you go to the cliffs?\u201d he asked her suspiciously.</p><p>She arched a brow to him. \u201cGhost hunt!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGhost hunt,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like that\u2014ghost hunt. I thought you told me that it wasn\u2019t anything like dial-a-ghost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. That\u2019s why it\u2019s hunting,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cSam, we\u2019re looking at similar crimes in the same place, different times. It might be good to see what we can find that attunes us to a similar energy. Trust me, please, on this.\u201d</p><p>Jamie had already headed for the door. Jackson followed him and Sam started to do the same. Instead, he headed back. \u201cBe careful,\u201d he told Jenna. \u201cPlease, be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. FBI agents here, albeit on the weird side!\u201d Angela said cheerfully. \u201cBut, just so you know, I was a cop in some tough areas of Virginia.\u201d He nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd, honest, I\u2019m capable,\u201d Jenna said, smiling at him.</p><p>He hesitated, longing to walk over and kiss her goodbye. He didn\u2019t quite know how she was feeling about them, at least in front of her team, so he refrained.</p><p>He took a step closer to the two women instead and asked softly, \u201cJackson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe refer to him as Mr. Logic,\u201d Angela said. \u201cHe has some intuition, but remember, at one time, he was one of the best profilers in the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince it seems you\u2019re looking more the he-man, man\u2019s man variety!\u201d Jenna teased.</p><p>Sam went ahead and walked on out of the house.</p><p>Ghost hunting....</p><p>What the hell had happened since that night he\u2019d found the blood-drenched kid in the road?</p><p>He thought of the night gone by. Of Jenna.</p><p>Whatever it was, he wanted it to keep happening.</p><p>10</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me, did you know him before?\u201d Angela demanded, grinning as she turned to look at Jenna, who was doing the driving.</p><p>\u201cYes. No. Not really. I vaguely remember meeting him when I was young. His mom was a doll. She had Sam, no other children, but I imagine she would have liked to have had a daughter, too. She\u2019d kind of babysit area girls, let us have slumber parties and all at her house, so I saw him there. I think, once before, he yelled at me and I called him a jerk.\u201d She grinned. \u201cHe\u2019s still a jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your jerk now, I take it?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, I could have sworn... I mean, you were at his house when we got here? Still fairly early in the day... And he\u2019s certainly impressive. Size alone. I mean height and shoulder breadth, of course...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, definitely he\u2019s attractive. I was attracted, and I fought it for a while because of the circumstances, but then I started thinking about moments, and that we really only get moments out of life...but anyway, he\u2019s a high-powered attorney in Boston\u2014who really laughs at the idea that we actually communicate with ghosts\u2014and I love what we do. I think it\u2019s important. I think we\u2019ve saved lives. And I don\u2019t particularly care what kind of car I drive, and I grew up in a household that believed in magic, and...he\u2019s a hard-core New Englander. Practical all the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackson is practical all the way,\u201d Angela pointed out.</p><p>\u201cTrue\u2014but Jackson has also had his own experiences, so if he\u2019s not as intuitive, he still knows for a fact that there is more out there. And I\u2019m not trying to date Jackson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, in your mind, you\u2019re looking at a dead end,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, where could it go?\u201d</p><p>Angela laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ll never know if you don\u2019t look through the forest paths at the end of the road. Whatever. I\u2019ll try to stay out of it. So!\u201d she said, her voice denoting that she was changing the subject. \u201cI\u2019ve been here before, and I\u2019ve done all the touristy things in the center of town. What could we do that lies beyond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is now Danvers was once Salem Village,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cRebecca Nurse lived out there\u2014and her homestead is out there and, actually, it all started out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a ride,\u201d Angela suggested. \u201cI\u2019d like to reacquaint myself with all this, get a feel for it. Wasn\u2019t Rebecca Nurse supposed to have been a really good person? But was caught up in it really quickly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was associated with the wrong family, or that\u2019s the way historians see it. Just because the founders were Puritans didn\u2019t mean they were saintly or that they lacked human emotions\u2014like envy, greed and so on. It wasn\u2019t just that. Remember, these people believed that the devil was very real, and they allowed their fears to take them on a roller-coaster ride.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s what you feel is happening again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way\u2014think about it! Your neighbors have been brutally murdered. That\u2019s damned scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDriving through Salem, even in the early hours, it didn\u2019t appear that people were terribly concerned\u2014they were out in droves already, and half of them dressed up for Halloween!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause they feel safe\u2014Malachi is being held without bond. The devil is locked away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re looking at modern America. It\u2019s not like people stay indoors at every fright, even without all that,\u201d Angela pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYes, and it\u2019s a city and area like any other\u2014except that it has a tremendous history that we do take with us into modern America. We learned from the Salem Witch Trials. What I\u2019m saying is that there\u2019s no way yet to prove that Malachi isn\u2019t guilty\u2014the evidence, the solid evidence, points to him,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cI\u2019m just saying that because his family was so different, it was very easy for people to accept the fact that he could be an ax murderer. And I also think that we\u2019re looking at what is human and what has been human since the people first began walking around. Why do the sane commit murder? Passion, greed, anger, love\u2014avarice and envy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure you don\u2019t believe this just because you can\u2019t accept that Malachi Smith might be guilty?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cYou need to meet him. Once you meet him, you\u2019ll understand. I know that you will.\u201d</p> <p>She hesitated. \u201cBeing emotionally sensitive is a gift we share all share, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>They reached the homestead and it was barren and empty, field stretching out in either direction, the house sitting forlorn in the colors of autumn.</p><p>\u201cDamn! I forgot, it\u2019s only open by appointment except for Saturday and Sunday once it reaches this time of year,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s call for an appointment,\u201d Angela suggested.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll probably say no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe won\u2019t know until we try.\u201d</p><p>Jenna pulled out her phone and dialed the number on the sign. To her surprise, the friendly woman at the other end of the line agreed to meet them. While they waited, they stood outside the car and looked on at the structure.</p><p>\u201cShe must have been a truly sympathetic character,\u201d Angela commented.</p><p>\u201cThey deemed her innocent at first, but the girls put on another show, and she was questioned again. She was mostly deaf, and didn\u2019t answer the questions quickly enough, or misinterpreted or something, and she was then condemned. I\u2019m still in awe that their faith was so strong that they wouldn\u2019t tell a lie to save their lives\u2014those who confessed were saved through prayer, I guess. They paid the bill for being held\u2014for their room and board, and for their shackles\u2014and those who didn\u2019t die in prison were eventually freed. I\u2019d always imagined jail cells or a prison such as we see today, when I was a kid. But they were kept together, and their beds were mats on the floor. A number of the victims died while they were being held.\u201d</p><p>Looking across the expanse of property that surrounded the homestead, Jenna suddenly frowned. She pointed. \u201cThere\u2019s someone there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the house!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see...\u201d Angela said.</p> <p>\u201cThe person is gone\u2014she walked around the side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would someone be sneaking around the Rebecca Nurse Homestead?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cGood question,\u201d Jenna murmured.</p><p>A car drove up behind them. A woman exited the car and waved to them. \u201cHi! You\u2019re lucky, I happen to be available. I\u2019m Sandy Halloran, nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Jenna and Angela both thanked her profusely for coming out and, before they went farther, made a large donation to the upkeep.</p><p>Jenna had been here several times before, but it had been long ago. It never failed to tug at her heartstrings to think of a woman who had lived and worked in the heat and bitter cold of New England, who had endured childbirth many times, only to die at the end of a rope.</p><p>Angela was fascinated by the homestead, by the sparse furniture, by the hard life lived by seventeenth-century farmers. She listened gravely while their eager guide described Salem Village at the time, the families that constituted it and how family matters and money played into everything. \u201cA lot of people suggested that mold in the wheat might have caused the girls to have hallucinations,\u201d Sandy told them. \u201cI never bought into that theory. Why would only the girls be affected? I think that they started a lie, and perhaps they played it out so well that they believed it themselves. None of us will really know now, will we?\u201d</p><p>Angela and Sandy seemed to be having a good conversation so Jenna slipped outside, walked around the house and looked toward the western side of the property, and the graveyard. She remembered that the old section of the graveyard was closest to the old cart road; it was most probable that Rebecca Nurse\u2019s family had taken her body and brought it home, secretly, of course. Witches were not to lie among consecrated graves, and any of the victims who received a proper burial received it because the love of a family member was stronger than the fear of repercussion.</p><p>Rebecca Nurse, however, most probably would not tarry in the graveyard. She had been a wife and mother.</p><p>Jenna turned back to the house and paused. Made of mist now, and yet clearly there before her, stood the spirit of an old woman. Her dress was severe, fastened to her throat, with only a white collar against the dark blue of her bodice. A cap covered her graying hair; she was wrinkled and withered, but she had beautiful blue-gray eyes that carried centuries of wisdom. She made a hand motion and started toward the graveyard, so Jenna followed.</p><p>Certainly, there was no telling where Rebecca Nurse was really buried. In later times, the family had erected a stone to her memory. The remains of George Jacobs, Sr., another victim of the trials, had been unearthed on the Jacobs property in the 1950s and laid to rest here with great ceremony during the tercentennial. Jenna wondered if the spirit of Rebecca wanted her to honor him here as well, but she didn\u2019t head toward the memorial. She walked instead toward a patch of ground that was devoid of memorial markers, even the fieldstones that denoted the resting places of so many family members.</p><p>Fog swelled through the pines that surrounded the graveyard, and for a moment, Jenna felt as if she\u2019d been whisked back in time and that she and the old woman who had met such a cruel demise stood in a place entirely removed from all others.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to tell me?\u201d Jenna whispered.</p><p>\u201cLook to the young, and those who would be innocent, for they only learn from the voices around them,\u201d the woman said, her voice like the rattling of tree limbs stripped bare of their leaves. \u201cBabes so quickly learn that lies often serve to please, and so they learn to lie. They know not the tragedy of their words. John Proctor whipped his girl, and she had no fits. She found the others, and those who would watch and applaud, and she began again, and yet, I think, I believe, not with malice, yet with fear that what she began to believe was what she must.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven now, you forgive,\u201d Jenna said. She felt like crying for all those wronged. She didn\u2019t believe that she could have ever known such courage. She reached out toward the specter.</p><p>But the old woman seemed impatient. \u201cChildren! They know not what they say. They know not what they say.\u201d</p><p>The trees seemed to shake with the sudden burst of an autumn wind. The fog stirred and rolled and seemed to lift, and when it did, the image of the old woman was gone.</p><p>Jenna stood alone in the graveyard, wondering if she was indeed sane and gifted, or if she created what she saw in her mind. It was always so real, and then so completely vanished.</p><p>She realized then that either the spirit of the long-deceased woman\u2014or the spirit she created in her mind\u2014hadn\u2019t been talking about the past.</p><p>They had yet to interview the boys.</p><p>And, she believed, especially after the words of the ghost, the boys were the key.</p><p>Angela and Sandy emerged from the house, talking animatedly. Jenna realized that Angela would want to see the graveyard, and she was suddenly eager to leave it herself. She wanted to get to the cliff-side spit of land where kids\u2014old and young\u2014hung out. She told herself that they might not come at all\u2014not David and Joshua, anyway\u2014but she was anxious to try there.</p><p>\u201cSandy is an amazing tour guide,\u201d Angela said. \u201cI\u2019ve so enjoyed discussing the history with her. We\u2019re going to tour the graveyard\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jenna quickly stepped forward to take Sandy\u2019s hand and pump it. \u201cPerhaps another day! Sandy, you were so kind, so wonderful! I know we\u2019ll be back. Soon. Angela, I just realized that we might miss that appointment. We\u2019ve got to go...quickly. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppointment?\u201d Angela said. \u201cOh, yes, of course, how could I forget? Sandy, thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s really so much more to see here. They built what must be an almost perfect reproduction of the Old Meeting House in Salem Village. This is really where it all began. There are other houses\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you! We will see them!\u201d Jenna assured her. Grabbing Angela\u2019s hand, she dragged her back across the property to her car.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Angela said, once they were seated. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to get to the cliff side by the Lexington House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we were planning that, but school\u2019s not even out yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw Rebecca Nurse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a victim of injustice, Angela. I thought I was just listening to her talk about the past\u2014about the girls. But she was trying to help me now. I think an old man from the era was trying to help me at the graveyard in Salem the other night...someone who saw the injustice, and saw that lies created more lies, and people began to believe them, even those who weren\u2019t really involved. Angela, good people were involved all those years ago. This is totally different, we\u2019re living in a different world, and yet, it can all play out the same. People believe what seems to be obvious. And kids are all too easily caught up in playacting. And if you do it long enough, in your mind, it becomes the truth!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It cost more than three hundred dollars to get his car back, and though he\u2019d given himself a few stern lectures on being materialistic, Sam was grateful that his beloved Jaguar hadn\u2019t been scratched or dented.</p><p>\u201cNice ride,\u201d Jackson commented.</p><p>\u201cI do a lot of driving,\u201d Sam said. He saw that Jackson was grinning. \u201cOkay, hell, yeah, I like my car!\u201d</p> <p>He told Jackson about his previous meeting with the elder, Goodman Wilson. Jackson listened and said, \u201cHe really called himself Goodman Wilson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReverting to Pilgrim days, so it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very honest about the fact that they\u2019re a fundamentalist church. No singing, drinking, dancing...and certainly no worship of false idols. But I believed him when he said that their teachings were about peace and that they were strictly nonviolent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why did everyone hate Abraham Smith and his family so much?\u201d Jackson asked.</p> <p>\u201cI think it is human nature to hate what you don\u2019t understand. I think that the church tends to be isolated, and that the members keep to themselves. And, probably, what the people knew came from Malachi, who was in the school system. Oh, and Abraham did rail a lot, apparently, about the people who deserved to go to hell\u2014Peter Andres among them. But, since Abraham and Peter are both dead, I don\u2019t think that Abraham killed Peter.\u201d He hesitated, glancing over at Jackson. \u201cJenna is convinced that the killer dresses up as the Celtic horned god and goes in while in costume and then kills. Says she\u2019s seen it in visions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Jackson asked him.</p><p>Sam shrugged. He had just met the man beside him, but he knew that Jackson Crow had acquired an exceptional reputation with the bureau before joining Adam Harrison\u2019s special unit.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say that she\u2019s wrong. I don\u2019t know. It would be an easy way to come and go during Halloween\u2014apparently, it\u2019s a popular costume\u2014but Peter Andres was murdered six months ago. Back then they had no more reason to go after Malachi Smith than anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said that Abraham Smith hated Peter Andres\u2014wouldn\u2019t the police have questioned Abraham?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they would have gone after him if they could have,\u201d Sam said. \u201cEyewitnesses put him on his own property in Salem while Peter Andres was killed in Andover. Malachi loved to go to the cliff by his house, but he had no corroborating witnesses to vouch he was there when his family was killed. Even if he\u2019d been seen there by any of the other youths in town, I sincerely doubt they would have spoken up for him.\u201d</p> <p>They reached the Old Meeting House in Beverly.</p><p>As they exited the car, Jackson said, \u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God?\u201d</p><p>Jackson looked at him. \u201cThat I wasn\u2019t born a Puritan!\u201d</p><p>Sam smiled as they headed toward the door of the church. As it had been before, it was open. They stepped in, and shadows seemed to surround them.</p><p>\u201cGoodman Wilson?\u201d Sam called.</p><p>A man rose from the front pew. He turned to them.</p><p>\u201cAh, Mr. Hall. You\u2019re back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith a friend, Goodman Wilson. This is Jackson Crow,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do, sir?\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Goodman Wilson lowered his head. \u201cWelcome to our church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Wilson said to Sam. \u201cYou are still going in circles, hoping that eventually you will go around and around so long, you\u2019ll stumble upon what you\u2019re seeking?\u201d</p><p>Sam smiled. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like the mysteries of faith, in a way. I wish you God\u2019s blessing on your quest. I don\u2019t know what I can tell you that I didn\u2019t say before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, different day\u2019s job, different memories. I was chatting with Sam here and thought, \u2018How could he really know all his members?\u2019 I mean, what about those who have left the church?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cOur congregation is small. I know my members. They are peaceful. I don\u2019t know that anyone would go after the Smith family.\u201d Then Wilson asked in turn, \u201cAnd if, by some wild chance, someone murdered for Abraham Smith, why would they murder him after?\u201d</p><p>They were good questions, Sam knew. \u201cAll right, but you also said that Malachi was a fine boy with a great faith\u2014he just loved music. But many people think he\u2019s a killer. Would it be easier if you just gave us a list of your members?\u201d</p><p>Goodman Wilson once again smiled tolerantly. \u201cNow, you know I will do no such thing. Only a subpoena or warrant can compel me to, and even then it would be under immense protest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might want to help us, since it was one of your members and his family last killed,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cIn any way that I could, morally within my own heart, I would do so. But my members are not compelled to tell their neighbors or coworkers that they are members of this church. Faith is silent. It\u2019s in the heart. We are not evangelists. Those who truly seek the Divine Truth will find us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that I\u2019m Malachi\u2019s attorney. Is all of your stalling because he was not a member of your church any longer?\u201d Sam asked directly.</p><p>\u201cYou will have to bring the law against me,\u201d Goodman Wilson said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Now, I\u2019m sure you will do so, and we will speak again. I am at prayer, so I will bid you good day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>When they exited the church, Sam said, \u201cThe old bastard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe expects you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I\u2019ll have to get a judge to give me a warrant...and he knows I\u2019ll do it, so he\u2019s just stalling for time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to take care of that now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call my assistant,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI still plan on seeing the councilman and, of course, we have to go have our tarot cards read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cNothing like a good tarot card reading.\u201d</p><p>When Jenna parked the car, Angela got out and stared at Lexington House. She shivered.</p><p>\u201cVery creepy place. Why would anyone want to buy it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDespite or because of the tremendous history of the area, it\u2019s a great commercial venture as far as the tourist industry goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to get into the house,\u201d Angela said. \u201cWhat did you see in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurder\u2014but murder from the 1690s, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Jenna told her. She hesitated. \u201cSam actually suggested we go back in, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could sneak in?\u201d Angela suggested.</p><p>Jenna shook her head. \u201cNo, Sam has a good relationship with the lead detective. John will let us back in, but I want to ask him. We\u2019re probably looking at a court date for Malachi, and we don\u2019t want to jeopardize the relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Angela said. She shivered again. \u201cThe evil in men\u2019s hearts can linger, we do know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but that would make Malachi the one who was exposed to evil and, Angela, I swear that boy is not evil. He\u2019s almost holy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the cliff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight down the street.\u201d</p><p>They left the sidewalk and hurried across the grassy plateau that led to the dirt-and-pebble path that led up to the cliff. When they reached the top, Angela looked around and studied the trees and the open area, and the rise that led straight to the water. They could hear the crashing of the waves.</p><p>Angela walked over to the area where the hard New England granite jutted out over the sea. \u201cBeautiful,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014I think everyone local must come here at some time. It is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Angela turned to her. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we should be standing here.\u201d</p><p>Jenna laughed. \u201cWe should hide in the trees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hide, just sit. So that we\u2019re not seen immediately, don\u2019t scare anyone off.\u201d</p><p>They walked over to the barren oaks and sat beneath them. It was chilly. The autumn breeze turned to wind on the cliff, and Jenna lifted the cowl of her sweater higher around her neck. \u201cWe could sit and freeze here for a while,\u201d she said apologetically.</p><p>\u201cSo we could\u2014we\u2019ve done worse!\u201d</p><p>But they didn\u2019t have to wait long. In a few minutes, a group of three youths came walking up the path.</p><p>They were big kids\u2014most of them at least six feet.</p><p>The school\u2019s football team, Jenna thought.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s got it?\u201d one of them asked. He was a good-looking kid with stylish brown hair and a handsome, angular face.</p><p>Jenna frowned, studying him. She\u2019d seen him before. He\u2019d been at the common on the day she had first arrived, when the younger children had gotten in trouble for reciting the rhyme.</p><p>\u201cJonathan, there,\u201d said the boy who had followed directly behind the first. Jenna was pretty sure she had seen him as well that day.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s light it up!\u201d the first boy said.</p><p>Angela cleared her throat and rose, and the three boys started, staring at her. They seemed so surprised to see her that they didn\u2019t run.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Angela said, striding over to them with a wide smile. \u201cSorry, guys. Just wanted you to notice us before...well, you know. Before you pulled your cigarettes out.\u201d</p><p>Jenna rose, as well.</p><p>\u201cUh, hey,\u201d the first boy said, looking from one of them to the other.</p><p>Jenna stepped forward and offered her hand to the brown-haired youth who had led the trio. \u201cHi. I\u2019m Jenna Duffy. This is my friend, Angela.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJenna was showing me the place. She used to come here when she was young.\u201d</p><p>The three were on the defensive, and they now looked as if they wanted to bolt, but they weren\u2019t going to.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are,\u201d the brown-haired youth said. \u201cYou\u2019re Jamie O\u2019Neill\u2019s niece, and you\u2019re trying to get Malachi off when he\u2019s a bloody murderer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jenna kept an even smile. \u201cAnd I know who you are, I believe. You\u2019re David Yates.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. He looked across at the other boys. \u201cYeah, I am. What of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to get anyone off\u2014who\u2019s guilty,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cI thought that you could help us understand what happened. We\u2019re just trying to understand what has really gone on, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalachi isn\u2019t just nuts\u2014he\u2019s dangerous!\u201d the second boy said.</p> <p>\u201cJoshua Abbott, I presume?\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>He flushed and looked uncomfortable.</p><p>The third boy, Jonathan, backed away from them all. \u201cI\u2019m not even here!\u201d he said. He turned and fled.</p><p>\u201cAsswipe!\u201d David Yates called after him, and turned back to Jenna and Angela. He flushed suddenly, maybe due to his choice of language in front of two female strangers.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the truth\u2014Malachi is dangerous. And there\u2019s something really not right about him, I mean, really evil. I think that the ghost of old man Lexington got into him\u2014for real. He gave me the evil eye. I don\u2019t care what the fu\u2014what the psychiatrist tried to tell me. I know the evil eye when I see it. He made me hurt myself. I\u2019m not kidding you. I\u2019m lucky I didn\u2019t run into the little prick up here\u2014he might have made me jump off the cliff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank God you were just in a lunchroom,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jenna agreed. They were a good fifty feet from the cliff now; she intended to make sure that they stayed that way. Though these boys were still kids, they were also almost men.</p><p>\u201cBut now I\u2019ve got another question for you. I talked to Mr. Sedge at the grocery store, and he absolutely swears that Malachi was in the store on the day that Earnest Covington was killed. But you and Josh swear that you saw him running out of Mr. Covington\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did!\u201d Joshua said with conviction.</p><p>\u201cYou saw him? Malachi Smith. For certain?\u201d Jenna demanded.</p><p>Joshua lowered his gaze and his eyes shot downward to the left\u2014and toward David.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I saw him.\u201d</p><p>He was lying. She needed to get to him. The boys needed to be interviewed separately, just as Sam had said.</p><p>\u201cI saw him. You\u2019re damned right, I saw him!\u201d David said angrily.</p><p>\u201cYou bet, he was there. David saw him. I saw him,\u201d Joshua said.</p><p>\u201cAnd what the fu\u2014what the hell? The cops found him covered in his old man\u2019s blood,\u201d David exclaimed. \u201cSay the bastard is crazy and get him locked up that way, but, lady, do us all a favor and make sure that monster is locked away for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Mr. Sedge is lying,\u201d Angela said. \u201cWhy would he lie for Malachi Smith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell knows? I know my mom says the grocer is a crazy old bastard, too. He might think that Malachi was there, and he probably was\u2014the day before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she say all that about Mr. Sedge before or after he swore he saw Malachi?\u201d Jenna asked pleasantly.</p> <p>She saw a touch of color come to David\u2019s handsome face. \u201cHe\u2019s old and senile, that\u2019s what he is. He doesn\u2019t even remember where he puts stuff or what\u2019s on sale,\u201d the manchild said. \u201cAnd my father is councilman here, you know. Best friends with the mayor, and he knows the head of the cops and all that. I can\u2019t help it if Mr. Sedge is going into Alzheimer\u2019s. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Jenna said, \u201cin a court of law, facing charges of perjury and jail sentences if you were lying, you two would both swear that you saw Malachi Smith come running out of Earnest Covington\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>There was the briefest hesitation before David said, \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to court, lady. It\u2019s not going to happen. They aren\u2019t charging Malachi with that murder\u2014just the murder of his family. They figure that\u2019s all cut-and-dried because Malachi was found in the road in all that blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaked,\u201d Joshua added with a snicker.</p><p>\u201cWell, they just may charge him with Earnest Covington\u2019s murder. I know that the cops are planning to do so. And with the two of you swearing that you saw him, well, they may take a chance and add that to the existing charges. Why not? That would help get him locked away for good, which, of course, is exactly what you both want, right?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>They looked at her in stony silence.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here, David,\u201d Joshua suggested.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Ladies, it\u2019s been great, but we gotta go,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cHey, no, you two smoke your...cigarettes,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go. Oh, but you should think about this. If the police do charge Malachi with Covington\u2019s murder, you will have to go to court. And you\u2019ll have to swear an oath that you saw Malachi. And Mr. Sedge will be there, ready to swear that he saw Malachi, too. And that could leave the defense with a chance to prove that since someone else obviously killed Covington, someone else might well have killed the Smith family, and that Malachi is telling the truth. You\u2019ve already admitted to being near Covington\u2019s place...as a witness, or so you say.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cNice to meet you. And thank you so much for your help.\u201d</p><p>Angela smiled as well and walked past the two.</p><p>Jenna followed.</p><p>She knew that the two boys watched them all the way down the cliff. She also got the distinct impression that they would have liked to push them over it.</p><p>11</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back. With reinforcements!\u201d Andy Yates said, smiling as he shook Sam\u2019s hand and then Jackson\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cJackson Crow,\u201d Sam said, by way of introduction. He didn\u2019t attempt to explain who he was. \u201cWe\u2019re still beating the same path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do know,\u201d Yates told them, \u201cif I had thought of anything, I would have called you. I think that Malachi Smith is guilty as all hell, but if I were to find out something to the contrary, I would consider it my civic and my moral duty to tell you so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Councilman, I believe that,\u201d Sam said easily.</p><p>\u201cWe just had a few more questions about the property issue,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cAsk away. My life is public record,\u201d Yates said. He indicated chairs in front of his desk for the two to take while he walked around to sit behind the desk himself. \u201cI told you, I made a generous offer for the property, and I was refused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t a Wiccan, are you, sir?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>Yates smiled. \u201cMe? No. I\u2019m Anglican. Well, I try to be. Can\u2019t say I make church every Sunday, though we try. My wife, Cindy, she thinks it\u2019s good for the kids.\u201d</p><p>Jackson laughed easily. \u201cYes, my parents wanted me in church, too. And she\u2019s right\u2014growing up with a belief system is good for kids. At least, I think it is. When you hit eighteen to twenty-one, you can decide where you\u2019re going in life, but it\u2019s good to have a start learning that life does come with a moral code.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Yates said. He frowned. \u201cWhat would my being a Wiccan or not being a Wiccan have to do with the property?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were going to open a bed-and-breakfast, right?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. I thought it would be great. A bed-and-breakfast in a haunted house. You know, when the season is right, people love spooky old places like that with history. Well, old history. I don\u2019t know what it would be like now. I mean, before, the murders were all in the distant past.\u201d He looked at Sam and shrugged. \u201cActually, I\u2019m undecided on that thought. It could be worth even more now\u2014people can love the gruesome, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know the other interested party?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d Yates said.</p><p>\u201cSamantha Yeager\u2014she wanted to buy the property, too,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, well, sure. When she moved in, she came to some town hall meetings.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cImpressive woman. Have you met her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Sam said. \u201cBut I plan to.\u201d</p><p>Andy Yates laughed. \u201cWell, then, I imagine you\u2019re going for a tarot card reading. She\u2019s awfully busy these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be doing,\u201d Sam said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cYou think that she killed the Smiths? And Earnest Covington and Peter Andres?\u201d Yates said, his smile still animated.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t think anything, really,\u201d Sam said. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to look like I don\u2019t really have anywhere to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that? Oh, yeah, I think Malachi Smith did it, but we are a somewhat transient community. Some maniac could have come in and hung around and moved on,\u201d Yates said.</p><p>\u201cThere you go\u2014room for doubt,\u201d Jackson said, looking at Sam.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really room for doubt\u2014Malachi Smith was caught red-handed. Or red-bodied, the way I hear it. I\u2019m just surprised that you seem to be giving up so easily, Sam Hall. I mean, you are his defense attorney,\u201d Yates pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving up,\u201d Sam said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cBut we are investigating with research into the method and manner of the killings. These were crimes of passion, the way I see it,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cOverkill. Yes, those who are psychotic can practice overkill, but that usually comes with some form of torture. I think these crimes were perpetuated by someone with a real grudge.\u201d</p><p>Yates groaned. \u201cI see, I see, I see. And I\u2019m supposed to have a grudge because of my son. Well, I don\u2019t. David is doing extremely well. His grades are high, and he\u2019s being scouted for a football scholarship by a number of major colleges. I don\u2019t bear a grudge. Why should I? Malachi was taken out of school. That was that. I knew Peter Andres, of course. He was a substitute. All that poor guy did was try to help Malachi. I knew Earnest Covington. He came to meetings, too. He supported me. I\u2019d have no reason in the world to hurt either of them\u2014much less want to hurt either of them in a \u2018crime of passion,\u2019 as you say. And I suggest that you do meet Samantha Yeager. You\u2019ll feel pretty ridiculous if you are thinking that she might have swept into town, killed Peter Andres, and waited around to kill Earnest Covington and then the Smith family. I\u2019m afraid if you\u2019re looking for someone with a grudge, you do have nowhere to go. And, sadly\u2014and I mean that\u2014that just leaves Malachi Smith hitting a breaking point and going crazy and on a murder streak. Not sure I blame the kid, but it\u2019s a tragedy that Andres and Covington had to die along with the Smith family.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou feel nothing for them?\u201d Jackson asked quietly.</p><p>Yates sighed and leaned across his desk very slowly. \u201cYes, I feel for them. But they created the monster, didn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBratty little liars!\u201d Angela exclaimed as Jenna revved the motor.</p> <p>\u201cWell, bratty, yes. Little, no,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have dared try anything!\u201d Angela said, her eyes flashing. \u201cOr, if they had tried it, they would have been surprised. We\u2019ve had some pretty good training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so have they\u2014on the football field!\u201d Jenna said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not armed. And neither am I...but still, we\u2019re Federal agents,\u201d Angela reminded her.</p><p>\u201cI know. I was thinking that last night when the kid came at me in the cemetery. I\u2019m glad I realized he was a little punk. Still, maybe it was a good thing I\u2019m not armed\u2014what if I had panicked and shot the kid?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have....\u201d Angela assured her. \u201cSo, where now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d park the car and we\u2019d see what was going on in the center of it all.\u201d</p><p>Angela groaned. \u201cThe men are going for tarot card readings. You\u2019re not going to make me get one, too, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I thought we\u2019d see how Will is doing with his street entertainment.\u201d</p><p>When they drove back to her uncle\u2019s house and she parked the car, Jenna noted that Jamie wasn\u2019t back yet.</p><p>\u201cI wonder where he went. School has been out for a while, and he went in early,\u201d Jenna said to Angela. \u201cCall him.\u201d</p> <p>She was relieved when Jamie answered the phone right away. \u201cYou\u2019ll not believe this, lass, but I\u2019ve got myself a new patient!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>\u201cUm. And his name is Martin Keller.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kid from the graveyard last night!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same. Apparently, his mother was deeply concerned about the fact that he came home in his underwear last night.\u201d</p><p>Jenna laughed. \u201cWell, have you learned anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh! Patient confidentiality, I\u2019m afraid. Suffice it that I tell you that a kid in his situation would be truly sorry about a little fiasco like you experienced last night. I think the fact that he\u2019d have to see me would definitely make one such child repentant! I\u2019ll see you all later then. I\u2019ve just slipped out between meetings with...a patient...and the talk I must now have with that patient\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo, uncle!\u201d Jenna said, and hung up. She repeated the conversation to Angela, who smiled. \u201cWell, it is interesting to listen to the mouths of babes!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Rebecca Nurse told me this morning. It\u2019s the kids we have to get to\u2014and I\u2019m not going to feel guilty trying to question children, because it\u2019s the adults who have gotten to them!\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>They walked down to the pedestrian way. Once again, Haunted Happenings was in full swing. Stilt walkers in various costumes were posing for pictures and teasing the young and old alike. A troupe of performers was putting on a pirate skit.</p><p>Down toward the center they saw Will, resplendent in a sweeping velvet cape and top hat, and with a group of children sitting before him as he made multicolored light leap from a crystal ball and then dart about over their heads.</p><p>\u201cHe is a master of light and illusion!\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cAnd knowing the difference between the real and the illusion,\u201d Jenna added.</p><p>When Will saw the two of them watching him, he didn\u2019t miss a beat in his trick as he motioned for them to stay. Jenna nodded, and they waited. He completed his act with a final sizzle of light in vibrant colors above the crystal ball, and then he bowed to the applause and promised he\u2019d be back in a minute, when he\u2019d present them with a little bit of the old \u201cTrinidadian\u201d fantasy, magic and illusion.</p><p>The crowd before them dispersed. Will swept off his hat and cape and hurried toward the two of them. \u201cWine bar right there\u2014let\u2019s slip in. I could do with a nice Cabernet!\u201d</p><p>The establishment was as crowded as the rest of the area, but Will had apparently formed a bond with the young woman at the hostess stand and they were quickly brought to a small, intimate booth in the back. They were served quickly.</p><p>\u201cYou have news? Or you just wanted a glass of wine?\u201d Jenna teased.</p><p>\u201cTwo things,\u201d Will said. \u201cNot fifteen minutes ago, I saw the head of that church old Abraham Smith attended. Goodman Wilson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? How did you know it was him?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, ye of little faith!\u201d Will said in mock horror. \u201cJake. You\u2019d asked Jake to delve into things. He pulled up everything you asked for, and then some, gave us all a nice thick dossier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, the churchman was here, in the middle of all this?\u201d Jenna asked, surprised. \u201cNo liquor, no dancing, no singing...wouldn\u2019t that include no bobbing for apples?\u201d</p><p>Will shrugged. \u201cMaybe it doesn\u2019t relate to young children. He came and he looked around for a long while. Finally, he approached a group of children who had apparently come down as a school group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cHe bent down to talk to one of the little girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Jenna demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I couldn\u2019t hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jenna said, sitting back in disappointment.</p><p>\u201cAh, but it brings us to the second thing I have to tell you,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cSo tell us!\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cWell, one of the mothers recognized Goodman Wilson, too. She came over like a bat out of hell, and grabbed the little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess no one likes an unusual church,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cI did hear what the woman said to him,\u201d Will said. He lifted a hand before either of them could prod him. \u201cShe told him to get away from the children, that he had created Malachi Smith and caused everyone to die, and that his church was pure evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cHe just stood very straight and spoke to her calmly. He said that God loved everyone, and that Jesus taught us all to seek peace and to turn the other cheek. Then he walked away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that was it?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was it as far as Goodman Wilson was concerned.\u201d He smiled, waiting this time for one of them to ask him what else had happened.</p><p>\u201cWill, damn it,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay\u2014another mother came running up to the pretty blonde woman. She set a hand on her shoulder and said, \u2018Cindy! Cindy, please, please, don\u2019t let all this upset you so much.\u2019 And then the blonde\u2014Cindy Yates, I figure, started crying, and she said, \u2018It\u2019s that man. It\u2019s that awful man. He was trying to get near the children, and he creates killers. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the wretched old bastard had helped Malachi Smith do all those killings.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are booked. Well, Madam Sam is booked. She\u2019s the best, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d the ring-nosed girl at the counter told Sam and Jackson without much conviction.</p><p>\u201cOh, please, see if there isn\u2019t something,\u201d Sam begged, leaning on the counter and flashing her his best smile.</p><p>She smiled uncertainly in return. \u201cWell...I don\u2019t think I can get you both in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go. I can try again tomorrow,\u201d Jackson said, letting out a feigned sigh of complete disappointment.</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean, really. I should have her on a break when her current client comes out, but you ask so nicely...I can slip you in,\u201d the girl said.</p><p>\u201cThat is really good of you. Thank you, thank you,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>She smiled and walked toward the back. Sam followed her.</p><p>\u201cJust wait here. When the curtain opens, you can go on in.\u201d</p><p>Sam waited as told. In a few minutes, a twentysomething-year-old heavy-metal rocker type man with jelled black hair, head-to-toe tattoos, earrings, lip ring and giant lobe rings came out looking as if he had just reached nirvana.</p><p>Sam walked on in.</p><p>\u201cMadam Sam\u201d was something.</p><p>She was sexy.</p><p>She reeked overt sexuality; in fact, he assumed that a good portion of her \u201cclientele\u201d had to be pubescent males. Her breasts nearly heaved out of her peasant blouse. Her eyes were ringed darker than a raccoon\u2019s, and her boa constrictor seemed pleasantly entrenched with its head centered in her cleavage.</p><p>Sam sat down in front of her. She studied him for a moment and smiled. It was the kind of smile that made him imagine she might have a forked tongue of her own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Sam, too,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cGive me your palm,\u201d she said.</p><p>He did so. She let out a soft sigh.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, I see here that your life is...about to change drastically. You\u2019ve enjoyed the adoration and admiration of friends and strangers alike...but, ah! There\u2019s just a twist and jiggle in the lifeline. You\u2019re about to do something that will make you the laughingstock of millions!\u201d</p><p>She looked into his eyes. He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m flattered. You know who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know who I am. Now just ask your questions. I saw your girlfriend yesterday. You\u2019re going to ask the same questions, and I\u2019m going to give you the same answers.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. He wondered if he would have corrected her about Jenna if he\u2019d been the one to come in the day before. He doubted it. He\u2019d known then what he wanted; he just hadn\u2019t known if he\u2019d get it or not. He wasn\u2019t at all sure that one night constituted a relationship, but he knew that he was sure praying like hell for a second night like the one before.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m not going to ask you questions. I just wanted to meet you. I\u2019d been by to see Andy Yates, and he said that I\u2019d be impressed. I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now I\u2019m flattered,\u201d she said. \u201cSo\u2014you no longer think that I\u2019ve gone crazy and run amok and gone about town killing people?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll I\u2019ve tried to do from the start is ascertain the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth was handed to you on a silver platter on your drive into town,\u201d she said. \u201cIs that why you decided to take on the case? You just like a challenge? Or do you actually feel that sorry for the poor, demented kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a sucker, I guess, for kids covered in blood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I honestly wish you luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust curious\u2014what do you think will happen now? The kid will probably have to sell the house. Should I see to it that he starts a bidding war between you and Andy Yates?\u201d</p><p>Samantha Yeager took no offense at all. She stroked the back of his hand and seemed to stretch like a feral cat. \u201cOh, you are a naughty boy, thinking that Andy Yates or I might want to capitalize on this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you will, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cMaybe. Frankly, I don\u2019t know if I even want the place anymore. It\u2019s a long way down the road, the way I see it. I mean, the kid has a fantastic attorney, doesn\u2019t he? Maybe you\u2019ll still get him off.\u201d</p> <p>Sam stood. \u201cMaybe I will. Who knows? Thanks for your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, you\u2019ll be paying for it,\u201d she said.</p><p>He started out the curtain. She called him back. \u201cHey, handsome.\u201d</p><p>He turned.</p><p>She smiled and leaned forward, crushing her breasts together and pushing the boa\u2019s head from its perch. \u201cIf Red gets boring, give me a call.\u201d</p><p>He came back in and leaned toward her, heedless of the boa. \u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know what they say about the Irish, and especially those with red hair. Tempers\u2014and other things\u2014run hot. But, hey, thanks for the invite.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled, reached into his pocket and produced one of his cards. He slipped it under the boa and into her cleavage.</p><p>\u201cNice touch,\u201d she purred.</p><p>\u201cCall me, will you, if you think of anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can think of many things.\u201d</p><p>Sam smiled again, turned and walked out. He paid his bill at the counter, slipping the clerk an extra ten for getting him in.</p><p>She rewarded him with a look of absolute adoration.</p><p>\u201cMadam Sam\u201d must have been raking it in, while the clerk just got to work.</p><p>Jackson was no longer in the store. Sam went out into the street to look for him, and at that moment his phone rang.</p> <p>\u201cI found a few strays,\u201d Jackson\u2019s voice told him. \u201cCome on down to the wine bar. Jenna and Angela are here. I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s time to compare notes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my way,\u201d Sam said, hanging up and heading the few doors down.</p><p>Will had gone back to put on another show for the appreciative audience enjoying Haunted Happenings. When Sam arrived, he squeezed in next to Angela.</p><p>Jenna couldn\u2019t help but rue the fact that she was positioned between Angela and Jackson.</p><p>Getting ridiculous! she warned herself.</p><p>\u201cHow was your reading?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cInteresting. I\u2019m going to crash and burn,\u201d Sam said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cShe knew who you were, right?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Well, shall we compare notes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>Sam shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be lucky to hear one another over the music.\u201d</p><p>It was true. The booths were dark and velvet covered, and each was a little intimate enclave unto itself. Jackson had already updated them on what he and Sam had done during the day. Jenna and Angela told them about their day, as well. Jenna chose to omit trying to explain that she\u2019d had an encounter with the spirit of Rebecca Nurse, and Angela followed her lead. But she was adamant when she said that the boys were lying.</p><p>\u201cIt seems,\u201d Jenna said, \u201cthat David Yates is primarily the one saying that he saw Malachi coming out of Earnest Covington\u2019s house. I think that Joshua is just saying it because he believes David. If David says it\u2014it must be true. Sam, he did all the evasive things that someone does when they\u2019re lying\u2014and then he became belligerent. He more or less threatened us with his father, the mayor...you name it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t threaten him back. I did mention perjury, and that it was likely that he would wind up in court, and that an adult would contradict his testimony with passion and credibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well, then, let\u2019s see if that brings about a response of any kind,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>Jenna lowered her head, trying to repeat everything that Will had told them.</p><p>\u201cNow, that\u2019s really interesting,\u201d Sam said. He looked at Jackson. \u201cWhat do you think? Could Goodman Wilson be involved?\u201d</p><p>Jackson shook his head. \u201cI haven\u2019t met the boy yet. But if he\u2019s as faithful to his beliefs as you all say, he wouldn\u2019t lie, even for the pastor who kicked him out for loving music. And I do find that fascinating. And oddly charming. I don\u2019t know. I really think that if Goodman Wilson is involved, it\u2019s on his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not impossible,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cHey, profilers aren\u2019t perfect. But if you ask me...I don\u2019t see it being Wilson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, why do you think that Cindy Yates is so hateful toward him?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>\u201cShe believes that Malachi Smith wronged her precious baby,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cAnd if Malachi harmed her child, he did it because of the teachings of his father\u2014and his pastor. Actually, we should ask her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s hung up on me,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a way.... Odd. Her husband is so open,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Jenna said, and told Sam and Jackson that her uncle had taken on a new patient\u2014Marty Keller. \u201cTechnically, I\u2019m not telling you this. And technically, of course, I don\u2019t know myself. After he came home in his underwear, his parents decided that he had to see someone since it was obvious he must be having mental problems.\u201d</p><p>Sam smiled at her. \u201cWell, that\u2019s good. Keeps Jamie in the loop. I haven\u2019t heard back yet from John Alden about the tests on the costume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you could call him,\u201d Angela suggested.</p><p>\u201cI can....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when you do,\u201d Angela asked, \u201ccan you ask him if we can get back into Lexington House?\u201d</p><p>Sam looked around the table. Jenna saw that Jackson and Angela didn\u2019t flinch.</p><p>Sam nodded. \u201cYes, of course. I\u2019ll ask him about that, too. He may be tired of me and he may say no. I had the right to get in there, but...I\u2019ve been in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an old friend, right?\u201d Angela said. \u201cAnd I know you can get him to let us in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get in,\u201d Sam said. He sounded weary. \u201cI hope it can help. So far, Goodman Wilson claims he has a congregation that will give him an alibi for the murders. Jenna talked with Madam Samantha Yeager\u2019s clerk, and we know that she was working the night the Smith family was killed. Yates will have a pack of alibis...there has to be something missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boys,\u201d Angela murmured. \u201cI know for sure that they are liars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find out where they were,\u201d Sam said grimly. \u201cHey, do they have food in this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheese and crackers,\u201d Angela informed him.</p><p>He groaned.</p><p>\u201cWe need to move on,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Will was still in the street. He took a minute to confer with Jackson, but he wanted to stay on a while. He\u2019d head back to Jamie\u2019s house when he packed up for the night.</p><p>Jenna called her uncle, but he\u2019d already made it back home and was going to go to bed, so she, Sam, Jackson and Angela made their way through the costumed crowd\u2014garish, silly, horrific and beautiful\u2014to an Italian restaurant off Essex.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t eaten since that morning, and they weren\u2019t particularly talkative when the food came. When they had finished and stepped back outside, Sam said, \u201cI guess it\u2019s time to call it quits for the night.\u201d</p><p>Angela yawned. \u201cEspecially if we\u2019re going to get into the Lexington House in the morning.\u201d</p><p>With that prompting, Sam excused himself to put through his call to John Alden.</p><p>They could all hear John Alden groan at the other end. Nothing had come back yet from the lab regarding the school\u2019s horned god costume; he reproached Sam, reminding him that he would have called right away if it had.</p><p>His groan was louder when they asked about Lexington House.</p><p>But in the end, John agreed that they could all go in the next morning. Apparently he had a few words for John about making sure the FBI agents knew that they hadn\u2019t been asked in; Sam assured John that they all knew that very well and appreciated the courtesy extended to them.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s head back,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>Angela and Jackson strolled ahead. The revelry of the night had not abated, even though schoolchildren were no longer\u2014sanitarily\u2014bobbing for apples.</p><p>Jackson stopped walking. \u201cYou know, we all just dumped our stuff at your uncle\u2019s house. He doesn\u2019t mind, does he? I mean, do you have enough room, or should we have found an inn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, there\u2019s plenty of room,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cEspecially since Jenna can move on over to my house\u2014just a block down,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cOh, no!\u201d Angela protested. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t dream of putting you out, Jenna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cBut, really\u2014\u201d Angela began.</p><p>Jackson groaned, pulling her to him. \u201cMy darling, use a few of your investigative skills. Jenna wants to stay at Sam\u2019s, and Sam very much wants Jenna to stay at his place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course! I know, of course. I mean, I don\u2019t know. I mean, oh, Lord! Shutting up now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Jenna wants to stay,\u201d Sam said, looking down into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s the only right thing to do, really, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>In another block, they broke apart for Jackson and Angela to head to Jamie\u2019s house, and Sam and Jenna to return to his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When they stepped into his house, she started to say something about Samantha Yeager. He didn\u2019t let her.</p><p>He pulled her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo more case tonight,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>His mouth found hers and his hand was on her clothing.</p><p>She felt his fingers on her bare skin.</p><p>And she agreed.</p><p>Jenna wasn\u2019t usually a dreamer. And of all nights for her to dream, it shouldn\u2019t have been that night, while she lay curled against Sam\u2019s naked flesh, held in his arms.</p> <p>But she did dream.</p><p>She was standing on the walkway to the Lexington House. The dormered windows stared at her like giant dark eyes. The wind had picked up, and she could feel an icy salt chill to it. As she stood there, despite the wind, a mist of fog seemed to settle and grow darker and darker, silver mist at first, and then gray...and darker gray.</p><p>The house itself...could hold evil.</p><p>But...</p><p>Malachi Smith seemed so filled with light.</p><p>Malachi wasn\u2019t there. Someone else was. Something that had come, or something that had remained.</p> <p>She had to go into the house. The answers were there, somewhere, in the house.</p><p>She started up the path. A figure began to form in the mist.</p><p>It was that of a woman.</p><p>The old, worn woman who still had eyes of gentle watery blue.</p><p>Rebecca Nurse. Gentle, pious. Good.</p><p>Trying to stop her.</p><p>The specter of Rebecca Nurse held her hand up. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cNo\u2014for the lies will rip you apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will I know the lies, if I don\u2019t find the truth?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe children...they have fits. They listen to what they hear.\u201d</p><p>Jenna started to open her mouth to ask the specter more; she wasn\u2019t able to do so. The dark eyes of the house suddenly seemed to explode, and liquid spilled from the dormered eyes, and then the eaves, and the door frame.</p><p>Liquid rushing out to encompass her.</p><p>And the liquid was blood.</p><p>12</p><p>Sam awoke with a strange sense of comfort, especially considering the fact that he was the kind to wake with every detail of his current case lined up in his mind.</p><p>Then, of course, he realized he was draped in silky female flesh, and the thought was enough to achieve instant arousal. But he kept himself still, not wanting to wake her. He watched the sunset color of her hair splay over her shoulder and curl down her back; he felt the fall of her leg over his own and saw that her eyes remained closed, her breathing deep and even. He was tempted to pull her closer, as he had in the night when she\u2019d suddenly wakened and felt like ice.</p><p>It was nothing of course; she\u2019d smiled and assured him that she woke easily, especially in old houses where things creaked and moaned and always seemed to go bump in the night.</p><p>He\u2019d told her that he knew how to make her forget bumps and creaks in the night, though he wasn\u2019t sure at all about moans, which, of course, had made her moan and laugh. But she\u2019d been glad to accept his kiss and roll into his arms and forget whatever had plagued her in the wonder of new love or sexual fascination or whatever she had found in him.</p><p>He heard the second hand on the beside clock ticking, and he remained still, and for the life of him, he couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d remained with a woman overnight, or brought her home and thought about breakfast in the morning. His last partner had been in South Beach, a bikini-clad blonde he\u2019d met in one of the hotel clubs that brought the dancing out to the sand on Miami Beach. No thoughts of the future on either side. She was a bonds attorney from Ohio on vacation. And when she had propositioned him, she had assured him, \u201cHalf the women and all of the men are here just looking to get laid. Hey, it\u2019s like breathing, you know.\u201d</p><p>Like breathing...</p><p>In a way, yes, it was like breathing. But he felt something of awe that Jenna was there now, that the morning light was trickling in, catching the red of her hair and making it seem that a warm and surreal glow emanated from her and encompassed her. And he wondered what it would be like to wake every morning feeling like that, knowing the life and breath and vibrant beauty of such a woman beside him. So, high-powered, cutthroat Boston attorney meets Federal ghost buster/civil-servant, willing to put her life on the line for others, and working hard with a team of ghost busters/civil-servants who seem to have formed a working bond that extended into the kind of friendship that would bring them all to one another\u2019s aid, and still have enough left over for those others they ran into along the way.</p><p>His mom and dad would have loved that the girl they had known had become the woman now beside him.</p><p>Maybe that was something he shouldn\u2019t mention. He wouldn\u2019t want her thinking he\u2019d brought her home again so that the ghosts of his family might approve!</p><p>He winced; he still wasn\u2019t sure about ghosts. He knew that Jenna and the Krewe of Hunters seemed to have something\u2014an ability to see beyond what was obvious. But he still wondered what tricks the mind could play, and if there wasn\u2019t something in the psyche that triggered a memory, or if they had all somehow tapped into that vast percentage of the brain that scientists knew humankind had yet to figure out how to utilize.</p><p>She stirred against him. Her eyes opened, as green as an endless field, and when she smiled at him, he forgot all thought. He didn\u2019t whisper a word; he kissed her, and he made love to her, and she made love in turn.</p><p>Like breathing.</p><p>In this case, he thought, if you didn\u2019t breathe, you died.</p><p>Jenna saw John Alden\u2019s car as they drove up and parked on the sidewalk outside Lexington House. She looked again at the way the house stood, just up on its little rise, and she thought of the dream that had plagued her in the night.</p><p>It was one of the fall days in New England that warned of the approaching winter. The sky was gray and overcast, and even on the rise before the Lexington House, they could feel the chill breeze that ripped the coastline of Massachusetts.</p><p>She thought of how she often shook her head at the Puritans who had come to Massachusetts, seeking religious freedom but refusing to grant it to others. She thought of the people who had allowed the witchcraft scare to take root, and then she reminded herself that it had been a different time\u2014in Europe, thousands upon thousands had been hanged or burned at the stake for doctrinal differences between versions of one religion.</p><p>She found herself thinking of those Pilgrims who had come and died in the first harsh winter, and that perhaps they\u2019d needed to be stubborn and rigid stock to have ever made their home in the wilds of the new colony, where the wind was as rugged as granite rocks and as brutal as the winter\u2019s ice.</p><p>Lexington House stood there as it had for centuries, weathered and worn and holding the secrets not so much of humanity and the past, but of the madness that could enter any man\u2019s mind when he was brought to it\u2014or when the feral instinct of the animal that remained in man brought about those emotions that were far from fine: fear, greed, envy, hatred and anger.</p><p>Sam looked at her, frowning. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you want to go in again? I can just show the place to Jackson and Angela.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go in again,\u201d she told him.</p><p>She smiled. She loved the way he looked at her. The first day, his eyes had been filled with so much mockery. Now they showed concern.</p><p>\u201cI want to go in again,\u201d she amended.</p><p>The door opened as if it were a great, greedy maw, ready to suck them in. John Alden walked out onto the porch.</p><p>\u201cHey, you coming in, or what?\u201d he called out to them.</p><p>They crossed the street to the lawn and walked up the steps. Sam made the introductions, and John Alden peered at Angela and Jackson suspiciously.</p><p>But Angela turned on the charm, pumping John\u2019s hand and telling him how grateful they were to be allowed to assist Sam, and whatever John might have felt about any intrusion, he apparently decided to let go.</p><p>\u201cGlad you made it before we brought the cleaning crew in.\u201d He winced apologetically. \u201cEven here, even in fall, we\u2019ve got to get \u2019em in when there\u2019s this much blood, or the pests come on into the house, and the rats multiply and head on out to the whole neighborhood. We\u2019ve got to move on a real cleanup. We\u2019ve had the crime lab out. Prosecution has seen the place and defense has seen the place. Anyway, come on in, I can give you about a half an hour. Watch where you step, and what you touch.\u201d He looked at Sam.</p><p>They stepped into the house, entering the foyer together. Jenna found herself drawn back to the parlor and held back when Jackson and Angela started upstairs with John. Sam stood in the hallway, watching her.</p><p>She looked around the room and then closed her eyes for a moment. When she opened them, it seemed that an opaque quality had fallen over everything, as if she floated in a soaring motion back, and looked on from a distance. She was there, and she wasn\u2019t there. She was watching from a strange distance that couldn\u2019t be tallied by space but by time.</p><p>A woman moved about the room. Her hair was brown and graying and tucked back in a severe knot at her nape. She dusted and straightened up. She was doing so when a young man came to the door. He leaned against the door frame, looking in. His face was lean and well shaped; his eyes were dark and should have been appealing, but they had a hollow and bitter look to them.</p><p>The woman didn\u2019t look up. \u201cSoup in the kitchen, though you\u2019re not deserving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, I hope not,\u201d the young man said. He was in a long, straight coat, vest and suspenders. The woman was in a long, flowered gown with a high neck. \u201cWho the hell is deserving of week-old soup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lazy, no-good lie-about,\u201d the woman said. \u201cAnd the soup is fine. Fine for a lad who grew to be worthless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike my sister? My sister, who dresses in twenty-year-old clothing, mends and darns socks and grows old since no man of substance will have her?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>The woman looked at him. \u201cYou\u2019re a greedy one, as well as a worthless one. Would that I\u2019d never had such ingrates fall from my womb!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould that you never had,\u201d he agreed. He straightened where he stood. His hands had been behind his back. He drew them forward, displaying the ax he held and hefted as he spoke. \u201cWould that we\u2019d never lived in this godforsaken house. Would that we\u2019d had actual warmth in winter, that Father had allowed fires to burn, or that his heart had been open to more than a passion for hoarding at the expense of all else. Would that I\u2019d not spent my days in the attic, imagining the insanity of Eli Lexington hacking his family to little bits and pieces.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The woman looked over at him, frowning. \u201cYou\u2019re actually going to cut wood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mother,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u2019m not going to cut wood.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t start to scream until he walked toward her. Then, it was too late. His first strike was high and overhead and filled with passion and rage, and cleaved her skull so that her face seemed to fall apart in a burst of blood.</p> <p>And then he struck again and again. And when she lay dead, the young man sat down on the sofa, covered in her blood, and he waited. And in time, a tall man in a cap and shabby tweed coat walked in and made it into the parlor, where he saw the woman on the floor and his son drenched in blood.</p><p>He started to shout; the young man, who had been all but immobile, leaped to his feet, and this time, the ax hit its target first in the throat, and the only sounds that were heard other than the sickening crunch of the ax were those of a man choking...until those sounds came no more, and the man lay dead on the floor, and the smell of blood was stringent and horrible on the air. The man with the ax just stood there. Then the door burst open and a young woman came rushing in. She might have been pretty, beautiful even. But her face was far too thin; she appeared tired and worn, like a faded rose.</p><p>At the doorway, she surveyed the scene in horror.</p><p>\u201cI had to, Isabelle. I had to,\u201d her brother said.</p><p>\u201cAnd we must move, and quickly now. Your clothes! We have to get rid of your clothing, and we must get away so that we were elsewhere when this thing happened. Come, Nathan, come. Oh, dear brother, what have you done?\u201d</p> <p>The young man started to laugh.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lexington, he loved his wife,</p><p>So much he kept her near,</p><p>Close as his sons, dear as his life;</p><p>He chopped her up;</p><p>He axed them, too, and then he kept them here.</p> <p>Duck, duck, wife!</p><p>Duck, duck, life!</p><p>You\u2019re it! Oh, Isabelle! Now, I\u2019m it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathan! Come! Now. Touch nothing, we\u2019ll go out the back, to the cliff...I\u2019ll get you new clothing...we\u2019ll sink what you\u2019re wearing, Father\u2019s fishing weights are in the back...we must move quickly! Oh, dear baby brother, what have you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can hang me, Isabelle. They can hang me. Better death than the life we were living!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome!\u201d Isabelle urged, and at last, he seemed able to move.</p><p>Jenna stood frozen, the scent of the blood almost overwhelming her. The image of bits and pieces and flecks of flesh all around her was horrifying, and she felt as if her knees were composed of nothing but water.</p><p>The mist receded. She felt as if she was whisked back in time, and then thought she was going to fall....</p> <p>She didn\u2019t. Sam was holding her, looking down into her eyes with grave concern.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting you out of here. I don\u2019t give a damn what you say.\u201d</p><p>He half lifted her and strode, carrying and dragging her, out to the hallway, the foyer and then outside.</p><p>He set her down on the porch, and sat beside her.</p><p>\u201cJenna?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. Out here, the blood of the distant past and the more recent past was all washed away by the breeze that came in from the water, cleansing the sins of time.</p><p>She was no longer dizzy. She managed a weak smile and set her hand on his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. It\u2019s what you do. Maybe it comes at too high a price.\u201d</p><p>Her smile steadied; he hadn\u2019t even asked her yet what she had seen.</p><p>\u201cNo, because, as you can see, I\u2019m fine now. I just wish...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t seem to bring my vision to the right century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the Braden family. They weren\u2019t nice people, Sam. I mean, of course, no one out there deserves to be murdered, but I believe that the parents were pretty horrible to their children. The son did do it. And his sister knew, but she was the one who helped him get out of the house and clean up, and she probably swore for him at the trial that he wasn\u2019t in the house when it happened.\u201d</p><p>Before Sam could answer, they heard footsteps on the stair. John Alden came out to the porch and looked curiously at Sam and Jenna. \u201cYou done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thanks, John,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cAlmost!\u201d Jenna said. She jumped back to her feet.</p><p>Sam caught her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t do this to yourself,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She looked down and saw something dark and disturbed in his eyes. She couldn\u2019t allow him to stop her.</p><p>\u201cI have to go back in, Sam. I have to try,\u201d she said, and walked back into the parlor. She stared about the room. She closed her eyes and thought about the recent past. She tried to imagine the more current murders\u2014and a figure in a costume that resembled that of the horned god coming in to commit murder. She waited and she opened her eyes.</p><p>But the mist wouldn\u2019t come.</p><p>She saw the chalk markings and the blood stains, just like anyone else would.</p><p>And she saw no more.</p><p>Jackson and Angela came and stood in the hallway for a moment, and then came into the parlor. Angela stood very still while Jackson looked at the chalk marks and the blood spray and moved carefully about the room, as if he tried to imagine exactly how the killings had taken place.</p><p>Sam stood in the doorway, his expression stony.</p><p>Jackson looked over at him and, behind him, at John Alden, who stood just a foot or so behind Sam. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ready?\u201d John asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d Jackson repeated.</p><p>They all exited the house. Jenna and her group waited while John locked the house and replaced the crime-scene tape.</p><p>When John joined them on the lawn, Sam asked him, \u201cWhat about the lab report on the costume?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully, I\u2019ll get it back today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as possible would be great,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cSam, damn it, you know that I can\u2019t give it priority. It\u2019s a costume you took off a kid, and it may or may not have anything to do with anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, John, thanks,\u201d Sam said. \u201cStill, sooner would be better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Sam. I\u2019m doing my best here, huh? And that\u2019s good, considering I\u2019m starting to think you\u2019re almost as crazy as the kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but think of it this way. When we get to court, you\u2019ll have done your job backward and forward, the prosecution will love you if all this investigation\u2019s nothing and just proves the case against him is as airtight as you say,\u201d Sam told him.</p><p>Muttering, John waved to the others and headed down to his car.</p><p>When he was gone, Jackson looked at Jenna. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI can tell you about Eli Lexington and the Braden family, but I\u2019ve gotten nothing on Abraham Smith. Angela?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw a little girl, and I believe she died of typhoid sometime in the eighteenth century,\u201d Angela said apologetically.</p><p>Sam stared at them both.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got some work to do,\u201d he said. \u201cAlibis. We have to start cracking alibis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can give Jake a call, and he can do a lot of computer and phone work, at least with the members of the Old Meeting House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cContact him for me, will you, then? I have legal papers...I\u2019ll leave you all at Jamie\u2019s house. I\u2019ll be in contact soon.\u201d</p><p>He was leaving her though, and just as she felt like someone literally reached into her chest and squeezed her heart.</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cWe\u2019ll get going on a chart, trying to trace the movements of everyone involved.\u201d</p><p>Sam agreed and drove them to Jamie\u2019s house. He seemed to step on the gas when he drove away.</p><p>Sam sat at his desk, trying to work. He scribbled out scenarios for the courtroom, assuming he wasn\u2019t able to prove that Malachi Smith was covered in blood because he\u2019d loved his parents. He scribbled out a dramatic scene in which they had discovered enough evidence to at least prove that there might have been another killer, and he imagined his voice ringing in the courtroom as he introduced the facts that might save his client. Of course, the prosecution would fight him tooth and nail, and...</p><p>He stood, stretching, and he knew that he was here, alone, because his emotions, so constantly logical and controlled, were in the midst of absolute turmoil.</p><p>He\u2019d imagined earlier that he woke up every morning to have silken red hair sweeping over his naked flesh, and the warmth and beauty of an exquisite figure draped around his. Those green eyes of hers would open, and sometimes they\u2019d be lazy, and sometimes frantic, and sometimes he would just leave her sleeping because work was a reality of life, and, of course, they both loved their work....</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t imagination to relive the way Jenna had looked while \u201cenvisioning\u201d the past, be it real, or a product of the recesses of her mind.</p><p>He sat at his desk again and buried his head in his hands, tearing his fingers through his hair.</p><p>He had to think about the case. The case.</p><p>As he sat there, he felt a gentle touch on his head.</p><p>He spun around, thinking that, somehow, though he\u2019d locked the door, Jenna had slipped in.</p><p>He was alone. Completely alone.</p><p>His own imagination was going wild with everything that was happening.</p><p>\u201cHey! Is anyone here?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>His voice echoed in the empty house.</p><p>He cursed at himself. Crazy. He had to concentrate.</p><p>He flipped a page on his notepad.</p><p>Samantha Yeager: Clerk swears she was working when Smith family killed.</p><p>\u201cGoodman\u201d Wilson: says congregation will attest to his presence. Jake Mallory, agent, doing computer search for members and phone work.</p><p>Councilman Andy Yates: appears open and honest, denies nothing. Good suspect, since his son involved in altercation.</p><p>The boys, David Yates and Joshua Abbott: Liars. No known alibis for any of the occasions.</p><p>He hesitated and pulled out his phone and put a call through to Andy Yates\u2019s office. An answering machine informed him that it was Saturday, and that \u201cCouncilman Yates is devoting his weekend to his family. We hope you are enjoying yours, as well. Happy Halloween!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He hung up.</p><p>He wanted to know where those boys had been. Maybe not Joshua. According to Jenna and Angela, Joshua seemed the kind of friend who would go along with whatever David Yates said. David Yates\u2014the boy who had been the victim of the \u201cevil eye.\u201d A big kid now, a football hero. But did he really have what it would have taken to pull off the murders? Enough sense for a costume, enough rage to plot out a way for Malachi to be blamed? He was only seventeen.</p><p>Lots of heinous murders had been committed by seventeen-year-olds; he knew that well enough. Malachi was seventeen. Ah, but Malachi was supposed to be crazy.</p> <p>His phone rang, and he answered absently. \u201cHall.\u201d</p><p>There was a brief hesitation. \u201cSam, it\u2019s John. John Alden.\u201d</p><p>He looked at his phone, surprised Alden had felt the need to give his last name.</p><p>\u201cYeah, John\u2014did you get the results back?\u201d</p><p>Again, there was a brief hesitation. \u201cYeah,\u201d Alden said thickly. \u201cThey found trace amounts of blood on that costume you pulled off the kid. Trace. The costume had been washed, and might have been dry-cleaned, as well. We\u2019re still working on it, but...I\u2019ll call you back in a couple of hours. They\u2019re trying to see if it it\u2019s a match with the blood from the crime scenes now.\u201d</p> <p>At the house, Jackson put a call through to Jake Mallory, who had remained at their new offices in Virginia. He was glad that Ashley, Jake\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, was up from her family plantation in Louisiana to be there with him, or else he\u2019d have been manning the ship alone, since Whitney Tremont, the last of their sextet, was in Jamaica on her honeymoon.</p><p>The Krewe sat together at the dining room, talking on speakerphone.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to find and talk to all the members of a congregation when we don\u2019t have the pastor\u2019s agreement to let out a list of the members?\u201d Jake\u2019s voice positively boomed through the phone.</p><p>\u201cI believe that Sam is getting a warrant for the records, but it\u2019s Saturday, and that could take time,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just possible that a judge might block us, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to do this legally, right?\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cNot really, but yes\u2014we\u2019re talking about a court case here, so everything has to be obtained legally. Not, of course, that I\u2019d ever want you to do anything illegal,\u201d Jackson said.</p> <p>\u201cRight...well, I can pull up public records and newspaper clippings and dig around the best I can. What do you want exactly?\u201d</p><p>Jackson explained that they wanted to know exactly where Pastor Goodman Wilson had been at the times of the murders, and anything any of the members might have to say in reference to any of the players involved. \u201cAnd dig up anything else you can on Councilman Andy Yates, his family and a woman named Samantha Yeager, medium,\u201d Jackson added.</p><p>\u201cGee\u2014that\u2019s it?\u201d Jake said, laughing. \u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>Just as Jake disconnected, they heard commotion at the door and Jenna quickly stood up, heading toward it. Uncle Jamie had just come home.</p><p>She looked at him expectantly.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t betray\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie, tell us what you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this is public knowledge: Martin Keller is at the police station with his parents. They found traces of blood on the costume. Even though they\u2019ve been highly compromised, the horned god mask itself came through\u2014there was enough in a crease in the mask to make a one-out-of-millions match to Peter Andres. The costume and mask, it seems, were worn by the killer when Peter Andres was murdered.\u201d</p> <p>Sam sat across from John Alden. Marty Keller was in another room with his mother, waiting for the police to come question him.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want to know is, what in God\u2019s name made you have me research that costume?\u201d John demanded.</p><p>Sam arched a brow, thinking quickly. He leaned forward, as if the question were obvious. \u201cJohn, the kid came at Jenna in the cemetery in that costume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014and he might have just been a bratty kid, out to scare anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might have been, but since everyone knows that Jenna is working with me, it seemed completely logical that there was a reason for the kid to try to scare her. It was a hunch, John. You know\u2014hell, you wouldn\u2019t be a detective worth your salt at all if you didn\u2019t work off a hunch now and then!\u201d</p><p>John stared at him. He let out a sigh. \u201cAll right, you can\u2019t come in, but I\u2019ll let you listen in when we question the boy.\u201d</p><p>Sam stood behind the one-way glass, looking in. Marty Keller\u2019s mother had apparently been crying. She still brought a tissue to her eyes now and then. She\u2019d arranged for an attorney, and when Marty started to answer a question, his mother slapped his hand and told him he had to first consult the attorney, a white-haired man who looked deeply concerned.</p><p>But the attorney nodded to Marty.</p><p>\u201cI swear! I just took that costume after the drama inventory. I swear, Mom, it\u2019s the truth. I\u2014I wanted to help out in some way. I know that everybody is all upset \u2019cause the pretty FBI lady is helping that guy who wants to get Malachi Smith freed, and everybody is afraid of Malachi Smith. I thought if I could just scare her enough, she\u2019d go away!\u201d Marty Keller\u2019s voice was tremulous; he\u2019d been crying, too. \u201cAnd she\u2019s a liar\u2014that lady, she\u2019s a liar! She said she wouldn\u2019t call the cops if I just told her about the costume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t call the cops,\u201d John Alden told him. \u201cBut we found blood on that costume, Marty. The blood of a man who was your substitute teacher at times. She didn\u2019t call the cops on you\u2014and this isn\u2019t a matter of a mere prank any longer.\u201d</p><p>Tears streamed down the boy\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cStop badgering him!\u201d his mother cried.</p><p>John shot her a look. \u201cWho else uses those costumes, Marty? And I\u2019m warning you\u2014I\u2019d better find out that there was an inventory done before you took the costume\u2014and who\u2019s to say that you didn\u2019t take it before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetective, you are badgering my client,\u201d the attorney said. \u201cAnd unless you have specific charges\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to charge him right now with the murder of Peter Andres?\u201d John asked.</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d Marty\u2019s mother begged. \u201cPlease, no\u2014please check out his story.\u201d She gasped suddenly. \u201cI can prove that Marty didn\u2019t kill Peter Andres. I remember the day. It was that Saturday in April\u2014I saw the news first from the dentist\u2019s office. Marty was having a root canal that day. Who knew? Who knew!\u201d she cried with relief. \u201cI was so angry that he hadn\u2019t taken better care of his teeth...but it\u2019s true! You can call the dentist, Dr. Waverly Johnson\u2014he\u2019s in Swampscott. Call his dental assistant! Call them all. Marty is innocent of murder!\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cIt was that Malachi Smith!\u201d she said firmly. \u201cYou have him in custody. There is no reason for you to badger my boy!\u201d</p><p>John Alden looked frustrated. \u201cYou sit tight,\u201d he said.</p><p>He left the interrogation room and walked over to Sam. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I say it\u2019s time to find out what\u2019s going on at that school. Malachi Smith wasn\u2019t going there anymore. He\u2019d have been noticed if he\u2019d tried to get into the school during opening hours, and it\u2019s locked up at night now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam, you\u2019re a pain in my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. So, when are you starting at the school?\u201d</p><p>John let out a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a man keep the place under lockdown until Monday. Monday morning, we\u2019ll go in before the teachers and the students, talk to the drama coach, the wardrobe mistress, and every kid in the school. You happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a lark,\u201d Sam assured him.</p><p>\u201cPain in my ass!\u201d John repeated.</p><p>Sam started out. \u201cJustice, John, justice. She\u2019s a wicked mistress for us all!\u201d</p><p>Milton Sedge was in his office when Mabel, his last clerk on duty, knocked on his door. \u201cMilton, it\u2019s after seven. I saw to it that Harry restocked the shelves for the morning, and I\u2019m going home, okay?\u201d</p><p>Milton looked up. \u201cYou bet, Mabel. You go on home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a nice Sunday, Milton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, Mabel.\u201d Milton was still a big believer in closing on Sundays. The rest of the world had apparently forgotten that it was a day of rest, but he\u2019d be damned if he would. He worked the place himself, worked it hard. But Sunday was his church day, and he liked church. He had lost his wife, Sheila, some years ago, and Sunday he got to see his grandkids.</p><p>\u201cYou come on out and lock the door. I got the lights off, but you never know\u2014some wandering visiting Halloween fool might just walk in here anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet, Mabel, I\u2019ll be right out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight.\u201d</p><p>Milton added his last list of figures into his computer and rose. He left his office and headed past the pharmacy area and down the middle aisle, heading straight to the bolt at the front door. There was an alarm there, too, but it hadn\u2019t worked in a while. He was pretty sure that just the idea that the alarm was there was enough to ward off most would-be thieves. He never kept money in the place, or not much, anyway. The deposit was made every day at five, precisely.</p><p>As he walked toward the door, he paused. He listened, hearing a strange rustling sound from the canned goods aisle.</p><p>He walked around, but there was no one there.</p><p>Curious, he looked around a bit more and caught sight of something in the middle of one of the big overheard mirrors. What appeared to be a big lump sat on the floor, right around the corner, in the breakfast section.</p><p>The lump moved.</p><p>Milton groaned.</p><p>Well, Mabel had warned him. Or maybe the prankster or wino had been in the store and she hadn\u2019t seen him when she\u2019d left.</p><p>\u201cHey, come on\u2014we\u2019re closed!\u201d Milton said.</p><p>The shadow rose. Milton could see it in the mirror. Halloween prankster! he thought with sheer irritation. And on a Saturday night, right when he\u2019d been looking forward to his Sunday! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The person was wearing some ridiculous goat mask. Or a devil mask. Hard to tell which. The thing had creases and lines and horns.</p><p>\u201cBuddy, we\u2019re closed! Come on, now\u2014don\u2019t make me call the cops!\u201d</p><p>But the creature whisked around again, heading into the canned goods.</p> <p>Milton pulled his cell phone from his pocket.</p><p>\u201cLast chance. I\u2019m calling the police!\u201d</p><p>He started to hear a rumbling just as he reached an aisle where a giant stack of gallon-sized tins of olive oil had been aligned.</p><p>He paused, frowning.</p><p>Then his heart began to race and his instincts warned him to back up\u2014quickly.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t move quickly enough.</p><p>The first can caught him right in the forehead, and he saw stars. His legs went weak and he fell to his knees.</p><p>The next can broke his nose.</p><p>And then he wasn\u2019t sure what happened. One hit his shoulder, one his head again, and then he was aware of one coming straight for his eyes as he blinked and tried to look up.</p><p>He didn\u2019t feel anything after that.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t aware when another twenty cans fell on top of him, halfway burying him. One burst open, and olive oil spilled over his bruised body.</p> <p>He was aware when the shadow, the creature, the goat or horned devil, came walking around the aisle.</p><p>The creature didn\u2019t touch him.</p><p>It looked, stepped around him and hurried out of the store. On the street, the horned god swiftly joined a group of costumed revelers and blended into the crowd.</p><p>13</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a party tonight,\u201d Sam said. No hi, what are you doing, what\u2019s going on, good to talk to you, so glad you answered....</p><p>\u201cA party?\u201d Jenna said. \u201cUm, are you inviting us?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s important, I think, that we all go. You got a costume? It\u2019s a costume party,\u201d he explained. \u201cActually, it\u2019s being put on as a charity event by Ivy and Cecilia\u2019s coven\u2014the Coven of Light. The ticket sales benefit the children\u2019s hospital. It\u2019s all for a really good cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why we\u2019re going?\u201d Jenna asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt never hurts when you can aid in a good cause,\u201d Sam said over the phone.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2014where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the ballroom of one of the new hotels down by the wharf\u2014not far from the House of the Seven Gables. I\u2019ll pick you all up in an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour! But\u2014we don\u2019t have costumes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust run down to the shops across from the Peabody Essex Museum. There are three or four right there that sell all kinds of things. All right, I\u2019ll get you in an hour and a half.\u201d</p><p>She hung up and walked back to the parlor where Jamie was talking to Angela and Jackson. \u201cWe\u2019re going to a costume party. We have to get costumes. Quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. I\u2019ve lived here way too long,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cI\u2019m opting out of this. I\u2019ll be here. If you need me for anything, just give me a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe really have to get costumes?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, and quickly, let\u2019s run!\u201d</p><p>Most of what they were able to find so close to Halloween and on such quick notice were Wiccan capes and Goth clothing. Jackson went with a simple black mask and black cloak. Angela found a cat costume, and Jenna decided that she\u2019d try a modern Goth outfit with a ribbon corset and long velvet skirt and a shimmering purple hooded cloak. The clerk seemed deliriously pleased that they made their selections and paid so quickly.</p><p>They ran back to the house and dressed, Jenna using Jamie\u2019s room, since she\u2019d given her own to Angela and Jackson.</p><p>Jamie tapped on the door just as she was finishing up. She opened the door and he offered her an affectionate but flattering long whistle.</p><p>\u201cThanks. Maybe I should get a nose ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, nose rings, in my opinion, are dangerous,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cYou never know when someone might decide to lead you around by one. Seriously, lass, you\u2019re looking great! I just wanted to tell you to be careful out there tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie, I\u2019m always careful. I\u2019ll be with Jackson and Angela\u2014and Sam, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, Sam,\u201d he said, studying her with a twinkle in his eye.</p><p>\u201cJamie, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLass, you owe me no explanations. You\u2019re all grown-up now, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but...this is probably just circumstances\u2014we\u2019re being thrown together. And I don\u2019t think that...I don\u2019t think that Sam is capable of really believing in me, or even beginning to understand me.\u201d</p><p>Jamie laughed. \u201cAh, well, that\u2019s to be seen, isn\u2019t it? Sometimes we\u2019re far too hard on the ken of those around us.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure I understand him, then. How about that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He smiled and took a moment. \u201cSam Hall is a far better man than I think he ever knew. Maybe he\u2019s discovering it now himself. Anyway, he\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>She gave her uncle a kiss on the forehead and hurried out. Sam, Jackson and Angela were waiting for her. Sam, like Jackson, had gone for simplicity. He was wearing a black poet\u2019s shirt and black jeans beneath a black cape.</p><p>He stared at her a moment, then he smiled. \u201cWow,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cThanks. You\u2019re pretty wow, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJenna,\u201d Jackson broke in. \u201cSam was just telling me that the police verified Marty Keller\u2019s alibi for the day that Peter Andres was killed, so even with the trace evidence of Peter Andres\u2019s blood on the costume, he\u2019s probably clean. But what a good find you made.\u201d</p><p>Jenna looked at Sam. He was still studying her. \u201cYou were right,\u201d he said. \u201cAbout the costume, I mean.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, not sure of what to say. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe school will be under guard until Monday morning,\u201d Sam said. \u201cThen, the cops will go in and try to find out more about the costume. Thing is\u2014access. Almost eight hundred kids might have had access. Not to mention teachers and parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait till Monday,\u201d she said.</p><p>Sam nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019re scoping the local scene?\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cThere should be quite an array of characters at the party,\u201d Sam said. \u201cCouncilman Yates and his wife make appearances. Seniors from the various schools are tacitly admitted. I guess it\u2019s kind of a rite of passage. We won\u2019t see anyone from the Old Meeting House, but we should see Wiccans, every other belief held in the area, performers\u2014and mediums, such as Madam Samantha Yeager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cLet\u2019s head out.\u201d</p><p>The new hotel was modern and beautiful. The entry was grand, and a red velvet runner led to the ballroom. A large sign over the double-door entry read, Blessed Be! Welcome One and All!</p><p>Beneath the giant sign was one in smaller print. Frankenstein\u2019s monster and werewolves enter. Princes and princesses. Leprechauns, blobs, vampires, faeries, do come in! No crones, no hags, no warted beings on broomsticks. Only beautiful, modern Wiccan dress allowed!</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019d wanted to be Maleficent, from the Disney movie?\u201d Angela whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be cool,\u201d Sam said, grinning. \u201cShe was a fairy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! You made it!\u201d came a loud voice.</p><p>Jenna didn\u2019t realize at first that the wood nymph in the colorful eye mask who hugged her at the door was Cecilia.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Thank you so much for having us. Oh, Cecilia, meet my friends, please!\u201d Jenna said, and performed the introductions.</p><p>Cecilia laughed. \u201cHey, Sam gave us a very nice donation over the price of the tickets. And it is for a good cause. The area covens get together to donate their time, decorating expertise and money to put this on. All the revenue goes to the children\u2019s hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Jenna assured her.</p><p>\u201cGo in! Eat, drink, be merry and dance like a maniac!\u201d</p><p>They went in. Jackson and Sam went for drinks with colorful names such as Wiccan\u2019s Brew, Bloody Mary and Lew, Hallowine, All Souls-Tinis and Salem-hattans.</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d Angela said suddenly.</p><p>Jenna turned. There, not ten feet away, was a party-goer dressed as the horned god.</p><p>She started toward the being, but Angela tugged at her arm. \u201cAnd over there!\u201d</p><p>In the other direction, there was another horned god. This one, however, was busy drinking, and his mask was pushed back. He was a man of about forty, with a friendly smile and a lot of laughter in his crinkled face as he chatted with the pretty belly dancer before him.</p><p>\u201cTwo more over there,\u201d Angela said glumly.</p><p>\u201cWish we could just strip them all and have their costumes tested, too!\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>Jackson and Sam returned. Sam handed her a glass. \u201cWiccan\u2019s Brew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBourbon, cranberry, Sprite, if I got it right. Liked the color,\u201d he said and shrugged. \u201cShould have been called Witch\u2019s Brew. You know, don\u2019t you, that they would have hanged you? Witchcraft, magic, were illegal. I\u2019m not sure how I would have defended you. If they had allowed for the accused to hire defense, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have never danced with the devil,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He smiled. She waited. \u201cI just needed some time,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd what did time do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt made me know for certain that I didn\u2019t want to sleep alone tonight.\u201d</p><p>Jenna lowered her head, trying not to laugh. \u201cI have a feeling there are dozens of women in this room who would keep you from that fate,\u201d she told him. \u201cIncluding the snake charmer over here. Madam Samantha Yeager is here. With her boa constrictor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI draw the line at snakes in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet she\u2019d give it up for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t think that you\u2019d want to let her in,\u201d he teased. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, nope, don\u2019t think so. Not in this lifetime, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so do we have more lifetimes?\u201d</p> <p>He grew serious. \u201cI believe that we do have something. The soul. Heart and soul. Whatever makes us unique. Whatever that is about me\u2014nope, nope, still no. Just not my type. I love redheads. Especially when they have just a trace of an old accent.\u201d</p><p>Jenna started to speak, but the band abruptly stopped playing and the microphone gave out a sudden loud shriek. \u201cOuch!\u201d the speaker said.</p><p>He was dressed as a Native American, and looked good in the outfit. It was Councilman Yates.</p><p>\u201cWelcome, one and all. The good sisters and brothers of the Coven of Light have allowed me to address you all. First, welcome, and thank you all for coming out for this wonderful ball, and for supporting our children in their need!\u201d</p><p>His words were met by applause and shouts of approval.</p> <p>\u201cSecondly, we know that the area has been deeply concerned by some horrible things happening, and despite the fact that they have a suspect in custody, an investigation is still ongoing. I want to warn you all to be smart and practical\u2014well, I mean as far as your personal safety goes! With the cops\u2014be open and honest. Give them everything that they need. We\u2019ve come a long, long way! We don\u2019t give in to superstition, and we don\u2019t condemn a man until he\u2019s been proven guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt. That said, I know you\u2019re all still going to whisper about recent developments, but while you\u2019re doing that, be helpful and be careful. And that\u2019s all I have to say, except, Blessed Be!\u201d</p><p>The audience responded with applause and the band started up. Dancers drifted to the floor again. Jenna took a long swallow of her drink, which wasn\u2019t half-bad.</p><p>\u201cSo, they\u2019re all whispering. We\u2019ll hear what they have to say,\u201d Sam said, nodding to Jackson. The two, apparently, had found an instant and easy rapport.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drift toward horned god number one,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cThink we\u2019ll make it to all twenty of them?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>Jenna adjusted the lace and black velvet eye mask she was wearing and drifted casually toward the stage. She\u2019d noted that Councilman Yates had come down from the stage and was speaking to an outstandingly beautiful peacock.</p> <p>He kissed her, and by moving a shade to her left, Jenna could see the peacock\u2019s face. As she had expected, it was Councilman Yates\u2019s wife, Cindy, the same woman she had seen on the playground the first day she had arrived chastising the children.</p><p>The same woman who seemed to hate Pastor Goodman Wilson so much. The mother of David Yates.</p><p>She decided to move closer.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you so late?\u201d she heard Yates ask his wife.</p><p>\u201cMe? Where were you when I was trying to get our daughter settled with the babysitter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCindy, you know I have responsibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo everyone but your family!\u201d Cindy replied.</p><p>She must have noticed Jenna near them because she looked right at her, frowned and turned away. Yates watched her go, letting out a weary sigh.</p> <p>Jenna started to move on.</p><p>The microphone screeched again. The band stopped playing, the lights blinked and a spotlight shone on the dance floor.</p><p>Couples cleared off.</p><p>And a scantily clad snake charmer appeared. Samantha Yeager.</p><p>She was stunning with her long black hair, ribbed abs, and jeweled harem costume. She wore a gold snake crown around her forehead and held her boa high and undulated like the snake as she moved through the crowd. She swayed and sashayed with lithe talent, and a hush fell over the crowd.</p><p>She went from man to man, but she\u2019d also draw women out onto the floor and try to entice them to dance with her.</p><p>At the end, she found Sam. She reached out with a free hand, touched his face and drew her hand down the length of his body before doing a sleek fall to the ground.</p><p>\u201cMadam Samantha! See her for all your mystic needs!\u201d the lead singer from the band cried out.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my idea!\u201d</p><p>Jenna turned to see that Ivy, lips pursed, was at her side. She looked at Jenna and grimaced. \u201cShe paid a lot for that performance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s getting a lot of applause. It will prove to be the ball of the season, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlutty twit!\u201d Ivy said, and, shaking her head, walked back toward the door, ready to welcome any latecomers.</p><p>Jenna was ready for another Wiccan\u2019s Brew. As she headed over to one of the bars, Madam Samantha\u2014in all her half-naked glory\u2014cut in front of her. \u201cAh! Jenna Duffy. It\u2019s not a party until the cops...er, Feds show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncredible performance,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cWhere\u2019s your snake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, back in the cage...this is a lot of stimulation for a snake, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure your snake is used to stimulation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFood, sex, good wine...slinky pets!\u201d Samantha said to her. \u201cOh, you\u2019re not angry, are you? Your man is a stud, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I be angry?\u201d</p><p>Samantha laughed. \u201cOh, honey! You can\u2019t be that naive. Maybe he\u2019s got the hots for you, but I\u2019m sure I got a nice rise out him.\u201d</p><p>Jenna was glad that the way the woman said the words actually and naturally made her laugh. She probably couldn\u2019t have said or done anything more insulting, and she knew it because Samantha\u2019s face turned a mottled shade or red.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cExcuse me, I was heading for the drink line. Can I get you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah. You can get out of town. All you\u2019re doing is hurting a lot of good people!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoted. Now may I pass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou going to make me move?\u201d Samantha asked.</p><p>Jenna sighed. \u201cI am a Fed, Miss Yeager. Lots of training under my belt,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Samantha moved. But as Jenna walked by, she warned, \u201cYou should get out of the state. You need to be careful. Whatever training you might have had, you\u2019re not infallible. You could get hurt. I saw your cards, Agent Duffy. Actually, you could get dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d Jenna turned and asked.</p><p>\u201cI would never! I\u2019m telling you what I saw in your cards!\u201d</p><p>Jenna continued toward the drink line. She was stunned when her way was blocked again.</p><p>Not by Samantha.</p><p>By a peacock.</p><p>Cindy Yates stared at her with teary eyes behind her jeweled mask. She seemed to be trembling with rage.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you? How dare you!\u201d she demanded. \u201cHow dare you accost my son!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Yates, I was at the cliff, showing the area to a friend of mine. Your son came to the cliff when I was already there.\u201d</p><p>Cindy Yates continued to stare at her, shaking and looking more like a rooster at the moment. \u201cThat boy is the devil. That boy could kill us all. You stop trying to hurt our children. You stop what you\u2019re doing\u2014you\u2014you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jenna waited, certain she was going to hear another threat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014you\u2019re the cruelest, meanest person in the world!\u201d Cindy said.</p><p>Then she didn\u2019t threaten. She hauled back and slapped Jenna across the face with a startling strength.</p><p>Jenna was instantly aware of movement in the crowd. She knew that her group had rallied around her. She felt Sam at her back, as protective as a giant alpha wolf.</p><p>She lifted a hand quickly. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Mrs. Yates,\u201d she said softly, and she stepped around the woman. Whoever had witnessed the exchange began to huddle together and whisper, but Jenna knew that she had avoided a real scene\u2014or a brawl!</p><p>Sam caught her arm. She saw the gray of his eyes beneath his mask. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cMy cheek is stinging, but another Wiccan\u2019s Brew will fix that,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>He slipped his arm through hers and led her to the drink line. \u201cWell, we did want to get the lay of the land.\u201d</p><p>Angela and Jackson were behind them in the line, as if they\u2019d tacitly decided there would be no more divide and conquer; they would close ranks.</p><p>\u201cSo, Wiccan\u2019s Brews, four, please,\u201d Sam told the bartender. She looked at Jenna a moment, and then smiled.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Salem,\u201d the bartender said. \u201cGlad to have you here\u2014all of you. Welcome. I mean, come on! We are the original Patriots, too!\u201d</p><p>They thanked her and took their drinks. Ivy and Cecilia went up to the microphone the next time the music stopped. They thanked everyone and offered a special surprise performance.</p><p>Jenna was startled to see Will, elegantly attired, take the stage. She glanced at Sam, and she realized that he had planned the performance.</p><p>\u201cSneaky like the wolf!\u201d she whispered to him.</p><p>\u201cHey, thought he should garner a nice audience this way.\u201d</p><p>Will went through the beginning of his performance with lights and prisms, and then, to her surprise, a light went through the audience and settled on her. \u201cAh, we have an ancient Celtic queen to join us! Miss, if you\u2019d come to the stage...?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what he was up to, but Sam quickly escorted her to the stage. She\u2019d halfway expected the crowd to boo, but apparently everyone didn\u2019t hate them; she received the appropriate applause as Will welcomed her as his assistant.</p><p>\u201cAll are welcome here, but we are here due to the benevolence of the Coven of Light. So, we have our Celtic queen of old here, and she\u2019ll crown the two who have brought about this wonderful, giving occasion. Because we know, in modern Salem, that Wiccans believe that all souls have the right to do as they will, as long as they harm no others. No two show greater kindness of spirit than our true queens from A Little Bit of Magic\u2014Ivy and Cecilia!\u201d</p><p>Will handed her two beautifully wrought gold crowns surrounded with ivy leaves and flowers. He cast his hand out, and rays of light fell over the two women. Blushing, they headed for the stage. They had obviously not known about this part of the entertainment.</p><p>\u201cThis is really great of you, Will,\u201d Jenna whispered. \u201cBut what are you doing? What am I doing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTrust me!\u201d Will said briefly.</p><p>Ivy and Cecilia were escorted to the stage, where they stammered and flushed some more and thanked everyone who had helped them.</p><p>\u201cAnd now, they shall be crowned true queens of the ball!\u201d Will announced. \u201cBut! Every queen must have a king, and it\u2019s our beautiful Celtic goddess of old who will help find the proper kings for our queens! Goddess!\u201d he said, looking at Jenna.</p> <p>She arched a brow.</p><p>\u201cJust turn around and lift your hands!\u201d Will whispered.</p><p>When she followed his instructions, rays of light started shooting through the audience and landing upon the men in the crowd. Somehow, Will managed to find all those wearing the horned god costumes; there were a few vampires and werewolves thrown in, apparently for good measure.</p><p>The audience was laughing and applauding.</p><p>The costumed guests could do little but oblige, coming to the stage. Will was determined that each man would unmask, and she would choose the appropriate kings through their answers.</p> <p>The first two horned gods were from out of town; the second two were women, giggling schoolteachers from Idaho. Will said that they had every right to be kings, but if they were kings, they\u2019d still be called queens. The crowd laughed some more.</p><p>A vampire and a werewolf followed. The vampire, too, was a woman.</p><p>Three more horned gods came up. One was from Boston, one from Ipswich, and one was down from Gloucester.</p><p>They went through more and more horned gods.</p><p>Jenna didn\u2019t recognize any of them or their names.</p><p>Until the end.</p> <p>The last horned god had tried to slip away, but the good-natured crowd pushed him forward.</p><p>He was unmasked.</p><p>This horned god she knew.</p><p>It was Joshua Abbott, best friend of David Yates. Jenna decided that she definitely had to name him as one of the kings. The other honor went to Jason Middleton from Gloucester, since she\u2019d suspected that Ivy had been flirting with him earlier.</p><p>There was laughter and applause. And finally, Jenna was released from the stage. Sam was there, watching over her, arms across his chest as he surveyed everyone around her.</p><p>He stepped forward as an Indian\u2014Councilman Yates\u2014approached her. She could see that Sam was going to bar his way.</p><p>He did. Andy Yates stopped and stared at him.</p><p>\u201cMy God, I just heard what my wife did. I am so, so sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, she\u2019s upset,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>Yates looked at Sam, shaking his head. \u201cShe\u2014she\u2019s so fragile. Honestly, I\u2019m so sorry. She went home, you won\u2019t be bothered again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouncilman, it\u2019s all right,\u201d Sam said. \u201cWe understand.\u201d</p><p>Yates shook his head. \u201cI meant what I said. People should help you. But, you know, of course, everyone heard that there was blood found on a costume that boy had worn to try to scare you all away. It\u2019s reopened the whole thing for everyone.\u201d He paused. \u201cLook, we\u2019re good people, we really are. Ordinary people\u2014maybe better than others, because we do have a history of what lies and hatred can do. But be careful. Please, be careful!\u201d</p><p>Jenna nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded to Sam. \u201cReally. I\u2019m so sorry your evening was spoiled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not spoiled. We were about to dance,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, of course,\u201d Andy Yates said, hurrying on.</p><p>\u201cWere we really about to dance?\u201d Jenna asked Sam.</p><p>\u201cHell, yes. It\u2019s a slow number. I\u2019m kind of a tall guy, and I look ridiculous when I try to gyrate\u2014trust me. It\u2019s an ugly picture.\u201d</p><p>She was happy to go out on the dance floor with him, and shocked to hear the number end with an announcement that it was after two in the morning, time for all kings, queens, princes, princesses and frogs to head on out. They ended with the song \u201cClosing Time,\u201d and everyone started heading out.</p><p>As they drove from the hotel, Jackson said, \u201cA very interesting evening. Of course, Jenna, you did have to get slapped, but now we\u2019ve seen that Cindy Yates really is pretty much a basket case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard her talking earlier\u2014I don\u2019t think she believes her husband did enough when David received the so-called evil eye,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cThe question is\u2014could her disappointment in him for his failure to defend his son have caused him to commit murder, to prove he\u2019s a good enough father?\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to admit\u2014I\u2019m frustrated that it\u2019s another day until we get into the school,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI think it\u2019s really interesting that Joshua Abbott decided to come tonight as the horned god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA show of defiance or of strength?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, the little weasel wouldn\u2019t have taken off his mask if Will hadn\u2019t forced the issue!\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cBut Will did indeed force it,\u201d Sam said, smiling. \u201cGood man!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy team is the best,\u201d Jackson said gruffly.</p><p>Sam stopped at Jamie\u2019s house. Jenna felt Sam\u2019s hand on her arm. \u201cCome back with me. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReconvene in the morning? Around ten?\u201d he asked the others.</p><p>They agreed and said good-night.</p><p>Jenna and Sam drove in silence the rest of the way to his house. Inside, Jenna doffed her cape and let out an oath of exasperation. \u201cCorsets! The hardest damned thing in the world to get off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, but I\u2019m happy to be of assistance.\u201d He came to her, met her eyes and spun her around to work at the ribbons that tied the corset. \u201cHave to say, good outfit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad you liked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the best in the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw. You\u2019re just saying that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>The corset fell to the floor and she turned in his arms, reached up, lifted his mask and tossed it down, as well. He let the cloak fall.</p><p>\u201cI must say, we are messy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! We pick up in the morning.\u201d</p><p>The back of his fingers brushed over her collarbone and her breasts, and he said, \u201cNow, it\u2019s really becoming the best outfit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh? Better than the bits of fabric covering Madam Samantha Yeager?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she bother you?\u201d Sam asked, grinning.</p><p>\u201cNo, it might have been the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she was really angry. I insulted her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said that even if you were with me, you were a man, and when she slinked against you, she was sure you got an erection.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>Jenna shrugged.</p><p>He grinned, sweeping her off the ground and heading into the bedroom. He plopped her down on the bed and lay beside her.</p><p>He played with the catch on her velvet skirt. \u201cActually,\u201d he said, his smile deepening, \u201cI think that woman could shrivel the old horned god himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she murmured, tugging at his jeans.</p><p>He eased them off, lay half on top of Jenna and repeated, \u201cMmm. And that\u2019s a fact. Know what does give me an erection?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThe sound of your voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I can handle that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said softly, touching her cheek.</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, I think that I can physically handle that,\u201d she told him. She reached out for him, touching far more than his cheek.</p><p>He moaned, pulling her to him. They kissed, and she moved down on him, and they made love until light began to break, just drifting through the windows in whispers of luminescence.</p><p>When Jenna slept, she slept deeply, basking in the comfort of the heat that emanated from his body. She didn\u2019t dream.</p><p>They woke up to the loud sound of his bedside phone ringing.</p><p>The sound was strident, as if the plastic piece of equipment knew it was about to report something shattering.</p><p>Sam rolled over and answered.</p><p>Jenna watched the grim expression that tightened his jaw.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be down there. Thanks,\u201d he said tersely.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jenna whispered.</p><p>\u201cI have a dead witness,\u201d he told her.</p><p>14</p><p>A crowd had gathered around Sedge\u2019s grocery store.</p><p>Police tape, of course, prevented onlookers from coming too close. An emergency vehicle stood near the front door, helping the police create a shield to stop the curious from looking in.</p><p>John Alden, after conferring with one of the medical examiners, looked up to see that Sam was there with Jenna at his side.</p><p>He walked over to them and lifted the tape.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think\u2014you can see for yourself. And this is a courtesy, just so that you don\u2019t get conspiracy theories running around in your mind,\u201d John asked.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know what I\u2019m thinking?\u201d Sam asked in reply.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking the old guy was murdered, that he was being shut up just in case the D.A.\u2019s office decided to charge Malachi with the Earnest Covington murder. But Milton Sedge wasn\u2019t murdered,\u201d John said.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Then how did he die? Heart attack? What happened?\u201d Sam asked. It was just too damned convenient that Sedge\u2014the one voice to stand against the boys who claimed to have seen what they hadn\u2019t\u2014was dead.</p><p>\u201cDamnedest thing\u2014well, he was an old coot, you know. And I couldn\u2019t believe it myself at first, but he was done in by olive oil.\u201d</p><p>If John Alden weren\u2019t so grimly serious, Sam would have been tempted to laugh. As it was, he couldn\u2019t speak for a moment.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Jenna finally said.</p><p>\u201cBad shelving, and being in the wrong place at the wrong time,\u201d John explained. \u201cHe was having a special on those gallon tins of olive oil. Extra-extra-virgin olive oil. We have a large Italian community up here, you know.... Sometime this week, they\u2019d done up a display with tin on top of tin. He must have jounced against the stack, and the tins and the shelf and everything came down. I just talked to the medical examiner\u2014he received a lot of good head wounds, but it is possible that his old ticker stopped when all those gallons upon gallons crashed down on him. They\u2019re heavy as hell, especially for an oldtimer like Sedge\u2014test them yourselves one of these days.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve held a gallon of olive oil, John,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cWell, then you imagine dozens of those suckers coming down on you,\u201d John said.</p><p>Sam glanced to the side. A group of Sedge\u2019s employees had gathered there. They were sobbing softly, from some of his cashiers\u2014nearing retirement themselves\u2014to his younger stock and bag boys and girls.</p> <p>He walked over to the crowd. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>One woman let out a loud wail and fell into his arms. She took him by surprise, but he put his arms around her to pat her gently on the back. \u201cSo sorry,\u201d he said again. \u201cThere, there,\u201d he said ineffectually, but it seemed to help.</p><p>The woman tried to compose herself. \u201cIt was all my fault!\u201d she wailed.</p><p>\u201cMabel!\u201d another of the elderly cashiers protested. \u201cHoney, it was not your fault. Mr. Sedge wanted that display, and he told everyone exactly how he wanted it set up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no...\u201d Mabel moaned. \u201cI left. I left. I walked to the back and said that it was all closed up and I was leaving. And I told him to come lock the door. I should have waited. We should have left together!\u201d</p> <p>Sam kept trying to console the woman, but he felt a new spark of anger and suspicion. He held Mabel at arm\u2019s length. \u201cMabel, you\u2019re saying that you left him alone in the store, with the door open?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d She started to sob again.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, Mabel, this wasn\u2019t your fault!\u201d he said quickly and lifted her chin. \u201cWas the store empty when you left?\u201d</p><p>She frowned, looking at him. \u201cWell, yes. I mean, well, yes, I think so. I did the call over the announcement system. I asked everyone to check out, and announced that we were closing. I turned off the lights\u2014except, of course, we have the safety lights. And the lights were still on back in the office, but it gets kind of dark in here\u2014shadowy, at least. Oh, that\u2019s it! He didn\u2019t see that he was going to run into the display. Oh! Oh, no, it could have been a child. But the shelving was behind the tins...\u201d She broke down in tears again.</p><p>\u201cThere, there,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>Jenna had come to stand quietly beside him. He looked at her helplessly.</p> <p>She slipped in, putting her arms around the woman. \u201cMabel, none of this is your fault, and you get that out of your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe missed his wife, honey,\u201d another woman said hopefully. \u201cAt least he\u2019s with her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s true, that\u2019s true....\u201d Mabel agreed, but then she sobbed again. \u201cBut he loved his kids and his grandkids!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s with his wife, and he probably missed her terribly,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>Jenna managed to get Mabel into the arms of another of the women.</p><p>She grabbed Sam\u2019s sleeve. \u201cI want to see the body,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He frowned, staring at her.</p><p>\u201cSam, I\u2019m an R.N. Not a pathologist or anything, but I\u2019ve been around an emergency room a time or two. I want to take a look at the body.\u201d She looked up at him with her green eyes earnest and clear.</p> <p>He nodded, caught her hand and made his way to John Alden.</p><p>\u201cYou really want to allay my suspicions\u2014and those of anyone else, should questions arise, which you know they will,\u201d Sam said. He added, \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>John started to let out a sigh of exasperation, but then he looked at Jenna, and he seemed to hesitate, perhaps remembering the fact that she\u2019d brought in the horned god costume that yielded results.</p><p>He groaned. \u201cWhat? What? What now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see him, please,\u201d she said.</p><p>John scowled. \u201cThe medical examiner has cleared us to have the body taken to the morgue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll only need a minute or two,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cWhat now, what now?\u201d John demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhat now\u2014you\u2019re a good cop. And, of course, that doesn\u2019t mean that you have to agree to do any favors for me. But, come on, John. You don\u2019t want me having to question you later, or say that you were willing to accept the obvious with no question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPain, royal pain, in my ass,\u201d John told him.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m right sometimes,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cYou got two minutes. And be careful\u2014hell, I don\u2019t want either of you dead or crippled by olive oil.\u201d</p><p>Then John called to the officers who were holding the line at the door. \u201cLet them in!\u201d</p><p>Inside, techs were still marking off positions. It was obvious, though, that the rush had been to attempt to save a man\u2019s life, not preserve the scene. Towels had hastily been spread on the floor to keep emergency help from sliding into mayhem themselves, and the offending cans had been tossed everywhere.</p><p>But a path had been cleared to the body, and Sam watched as Jenna carefully made her way to Sedge\u2019s bloodied and crumpled form.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d the medical examiner, who had been writing on a chart, asked with a frown.</p><p>\u201cAlden\u2019s permission, Doctor,\u201d Sam said. The M.E. lifted an eyebrow, but he didn\u2019t protest.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be taking him out in just a minute,\u201d the doctor said.</p><p>\u201cThere will be an autopsy,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Accidental death,\u201d the M.E. assured him. \u201cAnd that didn\u2019t take a medical opinion. Just look at what happened here. Of course, that\u2019s not official. As you said, certainly, there will be an autopsy.\u201d</p><p>Jenna didn\u2019t touch the dead man. She went down on her knees, heedless of the conditions around her, and studied the injuries. As she looked down, she felt a strange ripple down her spine. She looked up.</p><p>And the dead man was there, looking down at her and at his broken body, incredible sadness in his eyes. He looked from his mangled form to her eyes, and he formed a single word with his ghostly lips.</p><p>\u201cMurder!\u201d</p><p>Jenna looked back to the corpse. Then, true to her word, she was up in a minute. She smiled her thanks to the M.E. and the techs that had paused to watch her.</p><p>\u201cR.N.,\u201d she said weakly.</p><p>\u201cHoney, he\u2019s way past that!\u201d one of the techs said.</p><p>\u201cYes, I can see that,\u201d Jenna assured the woman.</p><p>She walked to Sam, nodding, and they headed back out.</p><p>John Alden was right in front, still trying to soothe the crowd while writing in his notebook.</p><p>\u201cSee\u2014death by olive oil,\u201d he said, and there was no humor in his voice.</p><p>\u201cYes, definitely, the tins killed him,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cThere was no sign of a heart attack, although, of course, I\u2019m not an M.E.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d John said firmly. \u201cBut why do you say that?\u201d</p><p>She arched her eyebrows, playing for time as she sorted out what she had seen in her mind. She wasn\u2019t going to tell John Alden that the dead man\u2019s corpse had been standing over his earthly remains.</p><p>\u201cWell, on the one hand, there were deep contusions and lacerations on his head. It would be like being beaten to death,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, in my mind, his coloring\u2014I\u2019d expect different coloring from a heart attack. What time are they estimating time of death? I\u2019m going to say early last evening.\u201d</p><p>John stared at her, perplexed.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, on cursory inspection, that\u2019s what the M.E. believes. He must have had the accident when he was closing up,\u201d John said.</p><p>\u201cWho found him?\u201d Sam asked. \u201cThe store is closed on Sundays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis son came when his dad wasn\u2019t at church. We\u2019ve sent him on home. He has to tell his wife and kids. And...it wasn\u2019t good for him to be hanging around here,\u201d John said, sympathy in his voice. \u201cNow, I called you. I let you see the situation\u2014and the body. Can I get back to work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Thanks, John,\u201d Sam said, pausing before adding, \u201cOh, and, hey, by the way, if it\u2019s an accidental death, why are you here? I thought you only worked homicide.\u201d</p><p>Alden hesitated, looking at him. He sighed. \u201cWith the mess going on in Salem, naturally I\u2019m going to be called to the site of any accidental death. And Sedge\u2019s son called it in as a homicide. Since he might have been called as a witness in the one of the current murder cases, I decided I was going to stick with it and investigate it thoroughly. Happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet I am,\u201d Sam said. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Jenna added as Sam set his hand on her back, leading her from the crowd. Local stations were setting up cameras. Sam saw that a cable channel was already live and he knew from experience each one of them was hoping for a sensational scene. If it bleeds, it leads. But if it wasn\u2019t sensational, it wasn\u2019t national.</p><p>Jamie, Jackson and Angela were once again around the kitchen table at Jamie\u2019s house; they\u2019d been watching the news. Jenna told them what had happened at the store.</p><p>She was surprised when Sam\u2019s fist hit the table. He didn\u2019t seem to give in to frustration frequently. \u201cHe was murdered. Death by olive oil. Like hell\u2014it was murder by olive oil. Someone was in that store, and someone beat him to death with those cans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoincidence?\u201d Jamie asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in coincidence. Especially not when it\u2019s this convenient,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in coincidence, either,\u201d Jackson agreed and began firing off questions that Sam answered wearily. No, the door hadn\u2019t been locked. One of his longtime clerks had been the last to see him. No, Jenna was damned sure that he hadn\u2019t died of a heart attack when the tins had started to fall. He\u2019d been discovered by his son, who had called it in as a homicide.</p><p>Jackson\u2019s phone rang as they were sitting there. Seeing it was Jake, he put the phone on speaker.</p><p>\u201cInteresting news that might not have been easy to find, unless, of course, you thought to look in all the right places,\u201d Jake told them.</p><p>\u201cQuit gloating and tell us what you\u2019ve got,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cFirst, I found\u2014public record, Jackson\u2014articles for the Old Meeting House when it was founded, and when it was designated a house of worship. They requested more tax exemptions and conscientious objector status for some members, and a petition that was signed by most of the membership. Now, who didn\u2019t sign, that I don\u2019t know. That was something I had to dig for, so I\u2019m thinking most of them signed it, assuming it was a private petition. I\u2019ve emailed the list to all of you\u2014including you, Sam. Your contact info was easy enough to find.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Sam said glumly.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Jake said cheerfully. \u201cAnd here, children, is something that you should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpit it out, Jake!\u201d Jenna warned.</p> <p>\u201cBe nice, Miss Duffy! All right, your two prospective buyers are in business together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sam said, staring at Jenna with disbelief.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. There\u2019s a lot of \u2018doing business as\u2019 going on in both of their lives, but Andy Yates and Samantha Yeager are in business together. One of his company\u2019s companies is called Magic Madam. In any other state, it might have been a cleaning service\u2014I think Magic Madam and Her Gals is the name of a cleaning corporation somewhere in Georgia. Sorry, never mind. Anyway, seems like the money to start up came from Yates. He\u2019s the investor and she\u2019s the workforce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Andy Yates did say that he knew her and that she was an impressive woman,\u201d Sam said drily.</p><p>\u201cWell, she is impressive\u2014I\u2019m just not sure what her impression is!\u201d Angela said.</p> <p>\u201cAh, think about it,\u201d Sam said. \u201cWith the right guy...you never know.\u201d</p><p>Jackson glanced at him. \u201cYou mean someone with a repressed home life and a wife who\u2019s kind of a delicate flower but longs to be supermom and probably has no time for her husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Exactly what I was thinking,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cJake, you\u2019re brilliant!\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m even more brilliant. I looked up the school\u2019s football team. And I can tell you this. On the afternoon that Peter Andres was killed, Councilman Yates and his son were at one of the school\u2019s major football matches\u2014in Revere. There\u2019s a newspaper picture of the councilman with his arm around his son after the school won against Lynn, Mass. I tried all the timing\u2014the kid was in the game all day, and the whole team, along with Dad, celebrated at a restaurant in Peabody that evening. That accounts for daddy Yates, baby boy Yates and even Joshua Abbott for at least ten hours, and, according to the medical report, Peter Andres was killed between two in the afternoon and six in the evening.\u201d</p><p>Jenna looked at Sam, who appeared frustrated. \u201cThanks, Jake, you\u2019re still brilliant, you know, despite that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, thank you there, Miss Duffy. I\u2019m still on the list of members belonging to the Old Meeting House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake,\u201d Sam said, \u201cwhat I\u2019d like you to find out is if you can cross-reference members with people who have children in the school. We\u2019ll be heading there tomorrow when the police go in to question the kids and drama department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be on it. Should have more answers for you later in the day.\u201d</p><p>When they hung up, Sam glanced around. \u201cI wish he was my researcher.\u201d</p><p>Jenna smiled. \u201cJake\u2019s the best,\u201d she said. Her mind, however, was reeling with what the researcher had told them. She didn\u2019t want to share her suspicion yet, not until she had done a little sleuthing on her own. With Sam, despite the fact that he seemed to have accepted her and the others, she wanted facts. \u201cSo, Sam Hall, Esquire, where do we go from here?\u201d</p><p>Sam drummed his fingers on the table. \u201cI say it\u2019s time to pay another visit to Madam Samantha. The clerk said that she was working during the Covington murder and the Smith family murders. I still want to talk to her again. Obviously she knows much more than she\u2019s shared so far. We could try to catch up with the councilman, but it\u2019s Sunday, and I bet Mrs. Yates won\u2019t let him let any of us near him at this point. That leaves Madam Samantha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could go to church,\u201d Angela suggested.</p><p>They all looked at her.</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one knows me yet at the Old Meeting House. If it\u2019s a fundamentalist group, I\u2019m willing to bet that they meet all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can go with Angela,\u201d Jenna said. She didn\u2019t really want to go, but she wanted to make sure that Sam didn\u2019t rope her into going with him. She needed to do what she wanted to do on her own, at first. She had a hunch, and if her hunch was right, the crime-scene photos might prove it.</p><p>\u201cNo, too many people know that you\u2019re working with me. None of the church members would have seen Angela yet, so she could go,\u201d Sam said. \u201cExcept, of course, I think you\u2019ve all had your pictures in national magazines at one time or another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they recognize me, they\u2019ll kick me out,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Angela, you head to church,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Joshua Abbott?\u201d Jenna asked. \u201cHe was one of the people wearing the horned god costume at the ball last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get to Joshua tomorrow at school,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cYou could try to speak with him today\u2014his mother never threatened you,\u201d Jenna pointed out.</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d Sam said. \u201cAll right, I can try to get that in today, too. If not, I\u2019ll have John Alden make sure he breaks up the two\u2014David Yates and Joshua Abbott\u2014tomorrow. Even if we\u2019re considering them cleared, they know something. Call it a hunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hunch, huh?\u201d Jackson said, smiling. \u201cJust messing with you. I can do my part and try to get to the rest of the Abbott family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to speak with Milton Sedge\u2019s son,\u201d Sam said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to intrude so immediately on his grief, especially since none of us can do so now in an official capacity. This evening, maybe. John Alden isn\u2019t going to give me any help with that. He\u2019s convinced it was an accident that killed Milton Sedge. But I don\u2019t want to sit around, either, and with what we know now, I think that Madam Samantha could answer a few more questions.\u201d He looked at Jackson. \u201cMadam Samantha definitely has a bold edge to her, and she seems to like to taunt men. Jackson, you and I will go to see if we can\u2019t get in for more readings.\u201d He grinned at Jenna. \u201cNo offense\u2014you\u2019re not her type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo offense taken,\u201d Jenna assured him, relieved. She hesitated.</p><p>\u201cMadam Samantha, Joshua Abbott\u2014and Sedge\u2019s son,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cSam, do you have the police photos taken at all the murders?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cJust the Smith family crime scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I think I\u2019ll pay a visit to the police station. Can you call John Alden for me? At his level, he\u2019s probably typically off on Sundays\u2014probably rushing home after having been called in this morning.\u201d</p><p>Sam groaned. \u201cIf you want the photos, I should go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s best if I just go,\u201d Jenna said. She smiled. \u201cJohn Alden is a good guy, like you said. I think he\u2019ll help me. You call, I\u2019ll talk. I have a hunch. I just want to see something. I\u2019ll go to the station, see the photos, and then I\u2019ll just hang around on the street and watch Will\u2019s form of magic. We can meet up there.\u201d</p><p>The bored clerk still liked Sam. She probably knew exactly who he was by then, but she still seemed to like him.</p><p>And she still turned him down.</p><p>\u201cYou know, we\u2019re in full swing here these days,\u201d she noted. \u201cHalloween is just two days away. You\u2019ve got to understand. Madam Samantha is in the highest demand. She\u2019s doubled her rates for these last few days, and we\u2019re still turning people away. I can\u2019t possible slip you in today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must come out to breathe.... Maybe I could take her for lunch, coffee, drinks...something?\u201d he asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cAnd I haven\u2019t had a chance for a reading at all,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, no and no\u2014and I\u2019m so, so sorry!\u201d the girl said. \u201cLook, I do readings too, you know.\u201d</p><p>Sam was thinking quickly of something courteous and politic to say in return when a client in Gothic attire came out from behind the curtain. Madam Samantha followed, stopping dead when she saw Sam and Jackson.</p><p>\u201cI was just telling them how busy you were,\u201d the clerk said.</p><p>Madam Samantha smiled slowly. She pointed at Sam. \u201cYou. You, come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo get her, buddy,\u201d Jackson whispered lightly to Sam. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to the charming clerk for a bit and see if I can\u2019t still verify our tarot reader\u2019s whereabouts, see if there was any way she might have slipped out during the murders.\u201d</p><p>Sam followed the sultry \u201cpsychic\u201d to the back. He was curious that she had decided to see him. She knew who he was, and she had to know he was trying to trip her up. What the hell was it that gave her so much confidence?</p><p>They went back to her curtained area. She took her seat behind her table with its crystal ball and tarot deck. She indicated the chair in front of the table.</p><p>\u201cGetting tired of Red already?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to figure you out.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hands and offered him one of her overtly sexual smiles. \u201cWhat\u2019s to figure out, Mr. Hall? I\u2019m an open book. You want to accuse me of murder because it\u2019s always the sexually unabashed and brassy woman who turns out to be the murderer. Come now, Mr. Hall, you\u2019re a renowned attorney! You know the world doesn\u2019t work that way. I was here, right here. I have a dozen witnesses to testify that I was working when the Smith family was killed. What? Do you think you\u2019re in Salem and you can use spectral evidence? My astral self went out and committed murder while I was here, in the flesh, with a dozen clients?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI believe that you didn\u2019t kill the Smith family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know about your partnership with Andy Yates.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her eyes and smiled slowly. \u201cHmm. Yes, well, someone dug deep to find out about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness agreements like that are public record,\u201d Sam reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYes, but...never mind. We weren\u2019t trying to hide assets from the government or anything. Yates just wanted it all...well, he\u2019s a councilman.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sam leaned forward. \u201cYou\u2019re the talent, I take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s the money.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe does do well,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBut you both tried to buy the Lexington House. Wasn\u2019t that a conflict of interest?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cOne of us might have gotten it.\u201d</p><p>Sam frowned, leaning back. \u201cSo why would Councilman Yates loan you money? Were you having an affair with him?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWell, you see, that\u2019s none of your business.\u201d She rose, walking around the table and leaning against it so that her legs were pressed against him. \u201cI should just tell you to go to hell. I obviously am innocent of the Smith murders, and the police have a kid in custody who was covered in blood. But I do like you. I like your scent, and I like your size, and I even like your face, Mr. Hall. Still, I am getting bored of all this.\u201d She leaned forward, hands on her knees, pressing her cleavage tight. \u201cNext time you call me, it had better be to get laid, or I\u2019m not going to talk to you again.\u201d</p> <p>She stood. \u201cNow get out.\u201d</p><p>Sam smiled and rose. \u201cMadam Samantha, you\u2019re right about one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really do want to get laid by someone who offers real excitement?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a good attorney. I\u2019ll find a way to bring you into the courtroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? But you don\u2019t have a witness anymore, do you? Poor Mr. Sedge was found dead today in a pool of olive oil!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see your concern.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here, working. You know that yourself.\u201d Her anger had returned to her face with a vengeance.</p><p>\u201cBefore I was an attorney, in law school, I went and got my private investigator\u2019s license, and I know a lot about breaking alibis,\u201d he said pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cCall me when you want to sleep with me, honey. You don\u2019t even need to buy dinner,\u201d she said, and winked.</p><p>\u201cOh, honestly, I don\u2019t think that will be the case,\u201d he said pleasantly, and he walked back out to the main shop room.</p><p>Jackson was leaning over the counter, smiling as he chatted with the clerk. He arched an eyebrow at Sam. Sam thanked the clerk and paid his bill for Madam Samantha\u2019s time.</p><p>He and Jackson walked out of the shop.</p><p>\u201cThe place does have a back door,\u201d Jackson informed him. \u201cBut Madam Samantha was fully booked with clients when the murders occurred at Lexington House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when Earnest Covington was killed?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot quite as packed, but still here.\u201d</p><p>As they stood on the street, he noted a couple walking by hand in hand. They were both dressed as vampires\u2014she was beautiful, and he was handsome. They made a cute couple; the costumes were exactly alike, except that his had pants and hers had a long black skirt.</p><p>It struck him that many people loved masks and costumes because they were able to be different people by wearing them. And, in fact, people could be each other.</p><p>\u201cJackson, what if...what if there were two people involved?\u201d Sam asked. \u201cSuch as two people who were having an affair? That would explain the costume. If the killer was seen in costume, and the plan was to commit several murders, it would be natural to suspect that it was the same person. A costume takes away an identity. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been going on all along. But what if there were two people involved\u2014maybe two people who were having an affair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this,\u201d John Alden told Jenna. \u201cI mean, I can\u2019t believe it. You\u2019re Sam\u2019s friend, Jamie\u2019s niece...and damned good-looking, but still, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this!\u201d he said.</p><p>Jenna laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re doing it because you\u2019re a good officer of the law, John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re going to get from the crime-scene photos? You\u2019ve seen the blood spray, so you know the murders were vicious and horrible.\u201d</p><p>Jenna nodded. \u201cI know. I\u2019ve never seen the victims in situ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Sam I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to answer the phone anymore when he calls,\u201d John said, sliding open a desk drawer.</p><p>\u201cI will not, because it\u2019s not true,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>John groaned. \u201cI love Salem. I love my home. I love the Wiccans, the shops, the people who shake their heads at the Wiccans and still appreciate all the tourism they bring in. I love the historians, who also shake their heads at the Wiccans, except for those who are themselves Wiccans. I haven\u2019t had my badge that long, and I\u2019ve explained that the chief wants this investigated and properly so. I want this to be solved, and over.\u201d</p><p>Jenna smiled at him. \u201cSee? And that\u2019s why you\u2019re helping me,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>He laid out a number of folders, pulling the photos from them.</p><p>\u201cI told you\u2014they\u2019re a gruesome sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jenna said. The photos depicted tremendous carnage. She had to study them carefully. And she thought that she found what she was looking for\u2014even though she hadn\u2019t actually known what she was looking for when she started out. But if all their suspects had an alibi for one of the murders, it seemed now that she might have discovered why.</p><p>\u201cJohn, look at the ones of Peter Andres.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as much overkill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? He\u2019s hacked to pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHacked\u2014just to make sure he\u2019s dead. Now, look at the photos of Earnest Covington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s\u2014 Well, he\u2019s far worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe killer was escalating. Isn\u2019t that the kind of thing you all preach about at the FBI? Or in your behavioral units?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sometimes. But I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s true in this case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re losing me completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re looking at two different killers,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>John\u2019s thick eyebrows shot up. \u201cTwo killers,\u201d he repeated. He nodded grimly. \u201cPeople thought they saw old man Smith when Peter Andres was killed, but eyewitness accounts are remarkably unreliable. Everyone knew that Smith hated Peter Andres\u2014Andres wanted Malachi taken away from his parents. Andres believed that living with Abraham Smith was like living with an abusive parent, even if Smith didn\u2019t technically beat the kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t really suggesting that Abraham Smith killed Peter Andres....\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s possible. He had motive. And he certainly owned an ax!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t find an ax at the murder scene, did you?\u201d</p><p>John scowled. \u201cYou\u2019d know if we had. Right, right, the bloody ax was at the Smith house. Andres was a scythe. Maybe Abraham Smith killed Peter Andres\u2014and his son knew it and just went crazier and crazier because Peter Andres was his one hope, his one salvation...and his father had killed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I understand, several witnesses saw Abraham Smith on the day Peter Andres was killed,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cAnd, as you said, and as I believe, people are basically decent. It\u2019s the odd man out who usually causes death and mayhem. And if Malachi Smith was going crazy with fury against his father, why kill Earnest Covington first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Earnest saw the kid getting ready to kill his folks,\u201d John suggested.</p><p>\u201cNo, that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Jenna said, thinking about her experience in the Covington house.</p><p>John wagged a finger at her. \u201cAnd how do you know that, Jenna? A ghost told you so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn, be rational,\u201d she said, not about to share the workings of her inner mind with him. John Alden certainly had to know something about her official work and their team, but she\u2019d never tried to explain to him that she could see ghosts. \u201cCovington couldn\u2019t have possibly seen Malachi\u2014or anyone\u2014from inside that parlor of his. And if he\u2019d been outside, Malachi would have attacked him there, right? Besides, Earnest Covington\u2019s door was open. He had just gone back in his house and was killed while thinking about his son. The evidence shows that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe evidence in your mind!\u201d John said.</p><p>\u201cWe know that the costume worn by Peter Andres\u2019s killer came from the drama department at the school,\u201d Jenna reminded him.</p><p>\u201cAbraham Smith could have gotten a hold of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it! He would have been reported at the school\u2014he, as in any member of the Smith family. Malachi Smith was out of school then, and pretty much so despised,\u201d Jenna reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not buying your explanation,\u201d John said.</p><p>\u201cWell, Abraham and Malachi as both being murderers doesn\u2019t makes sense to me.\u201d Jenna stood. \u201cJohn, I know I\u2019m pushing it, but could we get copies of these photos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d he told her. \u201cSam has already been shown photos regarding the Smith family. Malachi hasn\u2019t been charged in the other murders yet, and I don\u2019t know if Sam will pursue warrants and subpoenas on the other murders yet\u2014he doesn\u2019t have an eyewitness to support him anymore.\u201d</p><p>She leaned on the desk. \u201cThere\u2019s the horned god costume, John. He\u2019ll pursue the whole thing. I know he will.\u201d</p><p>John groaned. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it\u2014until a warrant comes or I decide! Damn, but you can tell you\u2019re Jamie O\u2019Neill\u2019s relation\u2014cuter, but a damned bulldog. Please, let me have the rest of my Sunday? God\u2019s day of rest, you know?\u201d</p><p>15</p><p>Angela Hawkins sat among a crowd of about one hundred at the Old Meeting House. Pastor Goodman Wilson was at the pulpit, preaching. She surveyed the congregation. The pastor\u2019s flock looked like ordinary people, but, as a group, they were a bit different than most congregations she\u2019d been a part of before. Here, the dress was conservative, down to the last person. There were no short skirts among the women, and certainly no plunging necklines. The men wore suits beneath their coats, button-down shirts and ties. Church wasn\u2019t exactly formal, but it was conservative and proper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The service had been going on for some time when she arrived, but an usher at the door, open and friendly, had guided her in.</p><p>Goodman Wilson was preaching about tolerance.</p><p>So far, nothing that she heard suggested anything ominous or particularly different from what she might hear in a sermon at a more commonplace church.</p> <p>\u201cMy friends,\u201d Goodman Wilson went on, \u201cwe are all here because we choose to be here. The world offers so many subversions. Satan does remain at the door. I say this, because Satan stands at the doors to our souls. We all know that he doesn\u2019t really play out there in the woods, trying to seduce the unwary to dance naked with him!\u201d</p><p>That brought about a spate of laughter, which, it seemed, the pastor had intended.</p><p>\u201cOur community is facing a time of trial again. We are often ostracized because our devotion is so deep, and because we see perpetual invitations to sin in those things others often see as innocent. But, my friends, we stand fast in our faith. We do not consider that we rise above others. We only know in our hearts where we want to go. While we practice tolerance\u2014patience with our fellow man, though our fellow man often has no patience for us\u2014we must also realize that we are part of this community. Jesus Christ suffered the mockery and cruelty of others so that we might learn to live our lives with His help to free us from sin. I am asking all of you to open yourselves up to the mockery of others. A terrible injustice is being done now. Though it will open you up to the mockery of others, I\u2019m asking that any who can help in the matter of the deaths of our brother Abraham Smith and his loved ones, look deep into your hearts, and open your hearts, souls and even your lives to those who are so desperately investigating the truth in this matter. My friends, my brothers, my sisters, I don\u2019t ask that you act in haste\u2014I ask that you search your own souls. I don\u2019t believe that anyone in the Smith family was a murderer. I believe that those investigating the case can use all the help they can get.\u201d</p><p>Angela stared at the pastor.</p><p>He had just baldly asked his congregation to step forward.</p> <p>\u201cGo in the peace and goodness of our Almighty God!\u201d Goodman Wilson said. \u201cMay God\u2019s blessing follow you as you leave this place of worship, and may you do His work in all things. Peace be with you.\u201d</p><p>With that, the service was over and Angela stood. A number of people eyed her, but most of them shook her hand and welcomed her to the church and asked her to return.</p><p>She was surprised when Goodman Wilson approached her after the service, but she thought that the pastor would probably welcome any newcomer.</p><p>\u201cAh, welcome\u2014Miss Hawkins,\u201d Goodman Wilson said.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou know who I am. Was that sermon for my benefit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Miss Hawkins, it was not. It was written last night as I sat at my desk and pondered all that was going on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you think that any members of your congregation truly know something?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. Angela saw that he was looking toward the door. She turned, and saw a woman hurrying out with a young teen and a little girl with blond hair.</p><p>\u201cCan I tell you that for a fact? No. But I do have members who have seen their children tormented by other children for their religious affiliations. If any of them does have information, I hope that my words will help them see what is right,\u201d Wilson said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s what my God dictates I do, Miss Hawkins.\u201d He bowed to her slightly. \u201cGood day, Miss Hawkins. I wish you Godspeed in your quest.\u201d</p><p>He walked away from her. Angela hurried out. She saw that the woman with the teen boy and small girl were getting into a car.</p><p>She made a mental note of the plate number, hurried to her car and wrote down the number. Then she put a call through to Jake Mallory.</p><p>Sam and Jackson had just stepped from the shop when Jackson paused to answer his phone. \u201cIt\u2019s Will,\u201d he said briefly to Sam.</p> <p>From where they stood, Sam could actually look over the heads of the crowds to see Will\u2019s \u201cmagic\u201d tent and the area before it where a number of people, young and old, in costume and not, were already gathering for the next performance. Will, inside the tent area, had his back to them as they talked.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Jackson said briefly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cThe two boys\u2014Joshua Abbott and David Yates\u2014are there. Seated toward the back in a group that\u2019s getting ready to watch the next show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll watch, too,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>The boys were in football uniforms. They might have just left a practice, since their white-and-blue uniforms were grass stained.</p><p>Sam and Jackson walked over to stand at the back of the crowd while Will turned around and welcomed his audience, challenging them to determine what was magic and what was science, and what lay in the magic of the mind.</p><p>Quite a showman, Sam thought.</p><p>Will\u2019s act that day was all about light and music. He knew that the beat of the music caused some of the jumping of the light, but he was still amazed at Will\u2019s ability at sleight of hand, because he was definitely maneuvering some of his performance so that he could keep an eye on the crowd\u2019s reaction, but he was doing it with an amazing ability.</p><p>He made the image of a brilliant fairy that seemed to be composed of colored light appear before one little girl, and when he closed his hand around it, he thrilled her by turning the image into a plastic toy and giving it to her.</p><p>He repeated the performance, creating a small football and handing it to David Yates, and then creating a toy horned god\u2014and presenting it to Joshua Abbott.</p><p>Before Abbott could respond, Will hurried on, creating his finale\u2014a large snow globe with a beautiful dancing fairy and presenting it to one of the young women sitting in the first row. He was greeted with thunderous applause, and those who had been sitting rose to move on, though some stayed, eager for the next show.</p><p>Sam watched as the two boys in their football uniforms stood and walked toward Will. David Yates was angry. Joshua followed behind him. \u201cHey, hey you\u2014what the hell was that all about?\u201d David demanded of Will. Both boys moved in on him.</p><p>Sam had the feeling that Will knew how to take care of himself, but he and Jackson seemed to decide simultaneously that it was time to step in.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>David Yates swung around. Joshua Abbott backed away about half a foot\u2014a telling gesture. On his own, Abbott would crack.</p><p>David stared at Sam, knowing who he was. The boys were big, but Sam and Jackson were bigger by a few inches. He could see in the boy\u2019s eyes the recognition that he wouldn\u2019t intimidate either of these men.</p><p>\u201cThis freak is playing with our minds. And you\u2014you\u2019re just ripping apart the community. You know who did it all!\u201d David Yates told him. \u201cYou know who did it all, and you want to prove that you\u2019re such a hotshot attorney, you can make someone innocent look guilty. He\u2014this freak!\u201d David paused to point at Will, who just grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll bet he\u2019s one of you! He tried to pick on Josh last night just because he was wearing the horned god costume. Tons of people wear that costume and you know it! And now he\u2019s handing him horned god toys, and if you don\u2019t lay off of us, my father is going to come at you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he?\u201d Sam asked. \u201cYour father seems like a true law-abiding citizen. I think he\u2019ll be more measured in his response than you\u2019re being.\u201d He looked at Joshua Abbott. \u201cSo why did you wear that costume last night? You had to know that we picked up Marty Keller trying to scare my colleague in the horned god costume from the school\u2014and that it had Peter Andres\u2019s blood on it.\u201d</p><p>Joshua Abbott looked at David and didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a costume that everybody wears around here!\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think?\u201d Sam said pleasantly. \u201cJoshua, I think you wore that costume because David goaded you into it.\u201d</p><p>Joshua Abbott turned red. \u201cNo, uh, no! It was my choice. I wore it because I wanted to. Hey, the freak is in custody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and, of course, you know Milton Sedge is dead,\u201d Jackson said quietly.</p><p>Sam thought that the confusion that briefly touched David Yates\u2019s face was real.</p><p>\u201cIt was an accident!\u201d he said. \u201cHe died in an accident!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d Jackson added.</p><p>\u201cAh, come on, what the hell is the matter with you guys? You\u2019re wicked idiots!\u201d David said. But he swallowed quickly. \u201cYou just want to make something out of nothing\u2014\u2019cause that kid is crazy. And he\u2019s cruel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Sam said. \u201cHe gave you the \u2018evil eye.\u2019 You need him to be crazy\u2014and a homicidal maniac\u2014to make sure you never look like an imaginative young idiot yourself, for beating your own head with a lunch tray.\u201d</p><p>David Yates turned red. \u201cHe gave me the evil eye\u2014I swear it! Hey, you don\u2019t put yourself in the hospital and having to see a shrink on purpose!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never suggested that you did it on purpose\u2014I do believe you did it to yourself. So does your dad,\u201d Sam told him.</p><p>\u201cMy dad is a pansy-ass!\u201d David said, apparently before thinking. He winced. \u201cStop it, please, stop all this!\u201d It was an honest plea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop\u2014when you two stop lying,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI will get you in court. And if you\u2019re caught perjuring yourselves, you will face the law yourselves. Think about that. And\u2014\u201d he grinned, looking up at Will, who had been watching the exchange with his arms folded over his chest \u201c\u2014next time a magician gives you something, just say thanks!\u201d</p><p>He turned to leave the boys to think over the encounter.</p><p>Jackson followed him.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Sam asked him. \u201cHow did I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re scared,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cThey should be. I get the feeling that...all right, well, they are lying. Now, is it just because they want Malachi locked away? Or is it because they\u2019re afraid for someone else?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jenna was just leaving the station when her phone rang.

Anyway, I watched a woman leave with two kids so I got her plate number. Jake ran it down for me. And the boy\u2014the teen\u2014goes to school with David Yates and Joshua Abbott. I think the little girl that Goodman Wilson approached was the daughter...and, since Cindy Yates went after him like a tiger, I\u2019m assuming that the family has been keeping their churchgoing activities a secret. I\u2019ve got an address. You want it? I\u2019m still hanging around by the church, but I can go if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m just leaving the station. I\u2019ll go. Who am I going to see? What\u2019s the family name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParents, Michael and Alice Newbury. Teenage son\u2014seventeen-year-old son, Michael, Jr. Little girl, Annie, seven. You\u2019ll find them just off Chestnut Street\u2014I\u2019ll text you the exact address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Angela!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and I just spoke with Jackson and Sam. They\u2019re going to go and see Mr. Sedge\u2019s son. After, we\u2019ll all meet at the wine bar.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right, see you soon.\u201d</p><p>Jenna hung up and a few seconds later, her phone buzzed, the address coming through. Checking it twice, she got in her car.</p><p>As she drove, she mulled over just how she was going to approach the family. All thoughts went out of her head when she drove up to park on the curve across the street from the modest home. The Newbury family was in the front yard. The teenage son, still lanky but growing tall, was tossing a football to his little sister while the parents looked on from their porch.</p><p>The father, Michael, saw Jenna and said something to his wife.</p><p>He walked forward as she approached. \u201cWell,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou found us quickly. Did Goodman Wilson tell you where to come?\u201d</p><p>Alice Newbury rose as well and came forward as Jenna answered honestly, \u201cNo, sir. My colleague saw your wife. We traced your license plate.\u201d</p> <p>Michael Newbury nodded, looking at his wife. \u201cJust as well. We should have spoken before. I\u2019m not sure what good it will do, but we should have spoken before.\u201d</p><p>The kids had stopped tossing the ball.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d the little girl asked her brother.</p><p>\u201cNothing, Annie, nothing,\u201d Michael, Jr., said to her. \u201cYou go play with your dolls for a little bit. We can run around the yard again in a minute. I think that the lady wants to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay we get you something, miss?\u201d Alice asked. \u201cWe don\u2019t drink spirits, but I can get you some hot coffee or cocoa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, come to the porch,\u201d Michael said.</p><p>Alice looked around, as if afraid their neighbors would see them talking to Jenna.</p> <p>\u201cAlice, we all need to admit the truth, and Goodman Wilson has taught us that it doesn\u2019t matter what path a man takes to God, he can be a decent man. Our neighbors are good people.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at her husband. Jenna found herself thinking that while their beliefs might be strict, they were together in those beliefs and had a strong bond.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Michael, Jr., you want to talk to. We\u2019d just be hearsay,\u201d Michael told her.</p><p>Michael, Jr., took a wicker chair across from Jenna on the porch. He glanced at his father. \u201cI can\u2019t really say anything that will help you a lot\u2014I mean that, I really can\u2019t. I would if I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, just let me know what has, clearly, been bothering you. You never know what will help an investigator in a situation like this and what won\u2019t,\u201d Jenna tried to reassure him.</p><p>The young man looked at his parents again and then at her. \u201cWe don\u2019t lie about our affiliation with the church,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t talk about it. We all went to the same schools for years, and we saw quickly that a lot of the kids really liked to tease and torment Malachi, so...well, I just tried to avoid being teased and tormented, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cSo, what do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything, except that David Yates has been the big man on the school ground since we were kids. And Joshua Abbott has been sidekick for years. If David says something, Joshua repeats it. If David wants to do something, Joshua will do it.\u201d</p><p>Jenna nodded. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve met them together, and I get that impression.\u201d</p><p>Michael, Jr., seemed to have gained his own confidence, knowing that his parents were behind him. \u201cDavid has talked about Malachi for a long time\u2014since the evil eye incident. But it seemed that he got even worse after Mr. Andres was killed. He told everyone that the Smiths had killed Peter Andres because \u2018that old freak hated Andres.\u2019 And he said that Malachi secretly hated him, too. And, well, everyone is kind of afraid of David Yates, so they all believe what he says. Anyway, then David and Joshua both said that they saw Malachi coming out of Mr. Covington\u2019s house the day that he was killed, and I know the police talked to him and his folks, but the grocer\u2014Mr. Sedge\u2014said that he\u2019d swear before God and the angels and all the saints that he knew damned well that Malachi hadn\u2019t done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we know that,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>Once again, Michael, Jr., appeared uncomfortable, and he looked over at his parents.</p><p>\u201cMichael?\u201d Jenna said softly.</p><p>\u201cWell, Mr. Sedge was already saying it, so...well, I was in the grocery that day, too. And I saw Malachi in there. I can\u2019t swear how long he was there, but I know that I saw him talking to Mr. Sedge, and I talked to him myself. He\u2019d left the church, but we all understood why, and we just kind of hoped that he\u2019d return....\u201d</p><p>They had another witness! But the witness they\u2019d once had was dead!</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way of our church, Miss Duffy,\u201d Michael, Sr., said. \u201cWe don\u2019t condemn those who leave. We just hope that they\u2019ll return.\u201d</p><p>Jenna nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d She stood. \u201cMichael, for now, please, don\u2019t say this to anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Alice Newbury stood in fear. \u201cYou\u2014you think this could put our boy in danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just think that you should remain silent for now. I won\u2019t tell anyone who will let it out of our realm of investigation, and you should just keep quiet, too,\u201d Jenna told them.</p><p>Michael, Sr., looked at his wife. \u201cShe\u2019s saying yes, Alice. Mr. Sedge is dead. Accident, my foot. We\u2019ll keep silent, Miss Duffy. Just as you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always silent at school,\u201d Michael, Jr., told her gravely.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a wise move,\u201d Jenna told him.</p><p>\u201cOh, the kids would never hurt me. I just don\u2019t want to be accused of giving any of them the evil eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you there when it happened?\u201d Jenna asked him.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you think?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated and shrugged. \u201cI think David might have believed that\u2019s what happened. But I know that he\u2019d gotten called down a few days before\u2014actually, by Mr. Andres. Mr. Andres really berated him for being so mean to Malachi. And Mr. Andres...well, he had a way of yelling at kids\u2014well, not really yelling\u2014but of making you feel really bad about what you did wrong. You know, he just had the right words, I guess. And that\u2019s what he did with David Yates. So, maybe, when it happened, David was feeling guilty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Jenna agreed.</p><p>Michael, Jr., smiled at her. \u201cI feel bad for him, really. I know he uses his dad\u2019s influence all the time to be kind of like a big man, but I think he believes sometimes that his dad doesn\u2019t help him enough. You know, he probably just wants more attention from the guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael, you seem to be wise beyond your years,\u201d Jenna said, and he flushed.</p><p>She thanked them again, shaking hands with the three of them. \u201cIf anyone asks me, I\u2019ll just say that I was doing a routine interview, that you were polite and cooperative but couldn\u2019t offer anything of consequence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Michael, Sr., told her.</p><p>Jenna hurried to her car, anxious to see the others.</p><p>Sam and Jackson stood at the door to the Sedge home. Sam carried a large basket with a smoked ham and an array of sides for the family; he and Jackson had decided that bearing food was the right thing to do\u2014and that it was their way in, as well.</p><p>An attractive woman in her thirties, her expression drawn and her eyes tearstained, opened the door. She appeared to expect people but frowned when she saw them, not recognizing them as neighbors she knew.</p><p>\u201cOur deepest condolences,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, accepting their offering. \u201cI assume you\u2019re friends of my husband, Ricky? I mean, forgive me, I don\u2019t know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were actually affiliated with Milton,\u201d Sam said. \u201cAnd I know that it\u2019s a horrible time, but...\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened suddenly. \u201cYou\u2019re the attorney!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam Hall, yes,\u201d he admitted, expecting the door to slam in his face. It didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cMy husband will want to see you,\u201d she said, staring at Jackson.</p><p>\u201cMy colleague, Jackson Crow,\u201d Sam explained quickly.</p><p>She nodded and opened the door wider. \u201cPlease come in. Neighbors are here\u2014and my mom is out back with the kids\u2014but Ricky is in his office. I\u2019ll show you right in.\u201d</p><p>Ricky Sedge was behind his desk in his den, a small room with shelves that held books and trophies and pictures\u2014family pictures. Sam winced inside, wishing he didn\u2019t have to cause the man more pain. It was evident that his had been a close-knit family; most of the pictures were family shots, many of Milton Sedge holding two little boys, many with Sedge and his wife, and several of various weddings, two older couples with the next generation of Sedges. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ricky Sedge had been sitting there, squeezing an exercise ball with a vengeance when they walked in.</p><p>He stood, surprised, and looked at his wife.</p><p>\u201cThis is the attorney, Mr. Hall, Ricky. And his associate, Mr. Crow. I thought that you\u2019d want to talk to them.\u201d</p> <p>He stood and, to Sam\u2019s surprise, he seemed pleased to see him. He was glad. He\u2019d half suspected that even if Sedge believed that his father had been murdered, he\u2019d want to blame Sam. He was the one pursuing the case others thought was sewn up, after all.</p><p>\u201cFinally! Someone who might believe me!\u201d Ricky Sedge said, indicating a couple of small chairs in the room. \u201cSorry, sorry, about the space. It\u2019s kind of a full house...Margery is dealing with all those trying to help. People don\u2019t realize that sometimes you\u2019ve got to be alone. Although, I guess it\u2019s good to keep the kids occupied\u2014they loved their Papa Milty.\u201d</p><p>Sam and Jackson took seats.</p><p>\u201cMr. Sedge\u2014\u201d Jackson began.</p><p>\u201cCall me Ricky, please. Every time I hear Mr. Sedge, I see my father.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRicky,\u201d Sam said quietly. \u201cI understand you found your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found him. Yes. I made a mess in all the olive oil, trying to revive him. But, of course, he was cold as ice,\u201d Ricky said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you called it in as a homicide,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Ricky Sedge hesitated a minute. \u201cYou know, sure, it looks like an accident. Unless you knew my father. He was a careful, honest, really good man. He would have never allowed those tins to be set up in a display that would have just fallen down on its own. When I say that to anyone else, they just want to pat my back and tell me that time will heal my wounds. And that the store was fairly dark, so accidents can happen, especially to the elderly. But my dad was in good shape, and he had great eyesight. Said he couldn\u2019t read a menu anymore without his glasses, but he could spot a bird in the sky a mile away. He didn\u2019t just walk into those tins of olive oil. Someone was in that store. Thing is, the police don\u2019t believe me\u2014they just want to pat me on the back, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a security tape?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>Ricky groaned. \u201cDad didn\u2019t have a security camera. He said that if someone needed groceries that badly, then they were probably hungry. The clerks knew all the neighborhood kids, and they knew how to catch the petty little gum-stealers. Dad ran a real family business.\u201d He leaned forward, studying both men. \u201cCan you make someone pay attention? Dad was the only one who was going to swear that Malachi Smith didn\u2019t kill Earnest Covington. He was killed because he\u2019d be willing to swear that up and down in a court of law!\u201d</p> <p>Sam let out a breath. \u201cThat\u2019s what I believe, too,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Ricky Sedge lowered his head for a moment. Then he looked Sam in the eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be sorry. My dad believed in honesty and justice, and he wouldn\u2019t have changed what he had to say, no matter what. You didn\u2019t kill him. But if you want to help, find out who did. Make the police realize that he was murdered, and find out who did. Make sure that they do face justice. That\u2019s what I want! That\u2019s what my family needs. Don\u2019t let my father have died in vain for doing the right thing.\u201d</p><p>Jenna looked into the wine bar, but none of the others had arrived. She went back out into the pedestrian throughway and decided that she\u2019d catch Will\u2019s magic show and see how he was doing.</p><p>Will had a little girl with him up on his impromptu stage. He was pulling quarters out of her ear and delighting the crowd.</p><p>He caught her eye. She frowned as she saw him jerk his head to the left.</p><p>Looking over at the edge of the crowd, she saw that he was indicating someone who was slowly drifting away from the scene.</p><p>Someone wearing the horned god costume.</p><p>She nodded to Will in acknowledgment.</p> <p>The horned god moved away, toward the road. She waited. He moved again, and she followed.</p><p>After a couple of blocks, he headed down a side street, toward the graveyard. She followed.</p><p>When she reached the area, she cursed silently. She\u2019d lost track of her quarry.</p><p>Dusk was coming, but the gate hadn\u2019t been locked yet. Jenna walked into the cemetery. In the misted light, she closed her eyes against the souls who seemed to hover around the graves, some aware of one another and chatting quietly, and one following a tourist from stone to stone, tugging at her sweater now and then and laughing delightedly when she looked around to see who was touching her.</p><p>Jenna wandered toward the area near the rear of the wax museum, reading stones as she went along. Some were very sad, so many having died at such a young age.</p><p>She felt something behind her back and whirled around. It wasn\u2019t a person; no one wearing a horned god outfit.</p><p>It was the same older man who had warned her away before, the ghost who had wanted her to know that she was being stalked. Of course, she was being stalked by the boy, Marty Keller, but the ghost hadn\u2019t known that.</p><p>\u201cGo! Go!\u201d he told her.</p><p>He lifted a thin arm, pointing toward the huge tree that had grown right through the centuries-old graves. \u201cHurry!\u201d</p><p>But as he spoke, a figure emerged from the tree\u2014a figure in the horned god costume.</p><p>He was wielding an ax. He hefted it in his hands.</p><p>Another kid trying to scare her?</p><p>There were still others in the cemetery, but they were more toward the memorial benches.</p><p>\u201cPut it down!\u201d she said angrily. \u201cI\u2019m calling the police!\u201d She reached into her bag for her cell phone.</p><p>The horned god immediately charged, ax swinging.</p><p>Just like in her visions.</p><p>16</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why she\u2019s not here yet,\u201d Angela said, taking a seat at the wine bar. \u201cI talked to her quite some time ago. She was visiting the members of the church, but she should have been back by now.\u201d</p><p>Sam frowned, wondering why he felt such an instant jab of fear. He dialed Jenna\u2019s number, and he was rewarded with her answering machine.</p><p>\u201cWhat if the church members...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no!\u201d Angela said. \u201cA mom went home with two kids. I saw her, Sam, and I don\u2019t know how to explain it, but no\u2014they wouldn\u2019t have hurt her!\u201d</p><p>Sam wasn\u2019t sure that he believed that at all. He stood and looked at Angela and Jackson. \u201cSorry, you wait here for her. Angela, give me that address. I\u2019m going over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. We\u2019ll call you, and you call us if you hear from her. I honestly believe she\u2019ll be right along,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cGo on, can\u2019t hurt,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Sam headed out into the street. Immediately, he saw Will performing, and Will, seeing him, looked concerned. \u201cThat way!\u201d he said, working the words and a nod strategically into his act. \u201cThat\u2019s magic,\u201d Will cried to the crowd. \u201cI say that way\u2014and you look that way while I\u2019m going the other!\u201d Sam didn\u2019t wait to see more. Will had indicated the road down to the cemetery by having him reverse his gaze.</p><p>He started out at a walk, then began to run. As he neared the graveyard, he heard screams.</p><p>People were hurrying out of the graveyard; he saw that a number of them had pulled out cell phones and seemed to be called the police.</p><p>He stopped one woman. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some maniac in there with an ax! He\u2019s after a woman. Oh, God, I hope the police get here fast enough!\u201d</p><p>Sam let her go and tore into the cemetery himself. He rushed through the wide-open gate and looked across the expanse of graves and grass.</p><p>And saw the horned god, and the ax. Jenna was desperately dodging and ducking his every swing of the blade.</p><p>And then she rushed him, making Sam\u2019s heart nearly stop.</p><p>Knocking the figure down, she rolled herself off him to get away.</p><p>But the horned god was back up, staggering, reaching for his head.</p><p>Sam took advantage, letting out a loud roar as he raced for the figure. Crashing into him, he took the demon back down, sending the ax flying to the side, cracking the man\u2019s head against a tombstone and falling in front of it. Sam stood quickly, crying out. \u201cJenna!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, hurrying to his side.</p><p>The horned god was still down, unconscious. Sam bent down and stripped the mask off his head. They both stared down in puzzlement. It was a man, a grown man. And it was someone Sam had never seen before.</p><p>\u201cDo you know him?\u201d he asked Jenna.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>By then, they could hear the police sirens. They stood a few feet from the man, waiting. Sam wasn\u2019t surprised to see that John Alden was leading the pack of officers who came rushing into the cemetery. If John had heard the word about a situation in the cemetery from the dispatch office, he would have been the first on the scene.</p><p>\u201cI should have suspected you two!\u201d he said, walking up, pulling out his phone and telling the paramedics to move in. He bent down by the body, feeling for a pulse. \u201cStill breathing. Wait, I did suspect you two. What the hell...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I was just walking in the cemetery, and he came after me. With that ax!\u201d Jenna said, pointing.</p><p>\u201cAnd he meant business. I saw it,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cAnd\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I tackled him, right after Jenna rushed him, and if she hadn\u2019t known something about defense, she\u2019d be bleeding to death right now!\u201d Sam said angrily.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d John said, feeling in the man\u2019s pocket for a wallet or ID. \u201cNothing, of course,\u201d he said with disgust. \u201cLet the paramedics through!\u201d he called to his men. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a live one here\u2014and we need him alive!\u201d</p><p>He looked at Sam and Jenna and sighed. \u201cAll right. Your attacker is out cold. Let the doctors do what they can for him. They\u2019ll call me as soon as he can be questioned. You know the drill\u2014it\u2019s time for the paperwork.\u201d</p><p>Before they left the cemetery, Sam called Jackson, to let the others know what was happening and that Jenna was all right. Jackson said that they\u2019d head to Jamie\u2019s and wait for them there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The paperwork was tedious but didn\u2019t take as long as it might have. The horned god ax-wielder in the cemetery hadn\u2019t come to. Apparently the shot to his head was quite severe, and the man was in a coma. His prints, though, were taken at the hospital and run through the police system, so before they left, John Alden came and reported to Sam.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Gary Stillman. Does that mean anything to you?\u201d he asked them both.</p><p>They shook their heads.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the system for misdemeanors in Boston. Seems he has a crack habit, too. That\u2019s expensive. But he wasn\u2019t really out to rob you, was he?\u201d John asked Jenna.</p><p>\u201cNope. Definitely there to kill,\u201d she said flatly.</p><p>John scratched his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell is going on here. He didn\u2019t kill the Smith family, that\u2019s for sure. He was being held in Boston on drug charges the night that the Smiths were killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGun for hire. We need to track a money trail on him,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cI told you, he wasn\u2019t the Smith family killer. He was being held on drug charges,\u201d John said.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, and you\u2019re hedging. Come on, John. Like you said, crack is an expensive habit. He was hired to kill Jenna. And you really know, somewhere inside, that no accident killed Milton Sedge. There\u2019s a killer loose here, because you\u2019ve got the wrong suspect behind bars.\u201d</p><p>John stared at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare tell me I don\u2019t know how to do my job, Sam!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d Sam argued. \u201cYou were right to arrest Malachi\u2014he was covered in blood. It\u2019s my job to prove he didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>John waved a hand in the air. \u201cGet out of here. Ever since you drove in, my life has been a nightmare!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you at the school in the morning,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>John gritted his teeth. \u201cYeah, yeah, first thing in the morning!\u201d</p> <p>An officer dropped them at Jamie\u2019s house. Jamie hugged his niece fiercely, berating her for walking into danger.</p><p>Jenna hugged him fiercely in return.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have been in trouble if Sam hadn\u2019t happened upon you!\u201d Jamie told her.</p><p>Angela and Jackson kept discreetly silent.</p><p>Sam found that he had to step up to the plate. \u201cActually, Jenna does know what she\u2019s doing, Jamie. She was holding her own.\u201d</p><p>Jamie looked disgruntled. Jenna shot Sam a glance that held a speculative, wry smile.</p><p>\u201cUncle Jamie, I\u2019m not quitting my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you all need to stop\u2014this is getting too dangerous!\u201d he protested.</p> <p>\u201cUncle Jamie,\u201d Jenna said quietly, \u201cliving is dangerous. I love what I do. It\u2019s important. And more people might die if we don\u2019t get to the bottom of this. It\u2019s always better to face danger head-on when you have to fight it.\u201d</p><p>Jamie opened and closed his mouth several times. \u201cI\u2019ll get the stew,\u201d he said at last, then gruffly added, \u201cYou set the table for me, eh, lass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help, too!\u201d Angela said, jumping to her feet.</p><p>They compiled the information they had all garnered during the day. Sam listened gravely to Jenna as she explained what she was certain the crime-scene photos told her. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as if I could say, \u2018Oh, the person who did was left-handed or right-handed\u2019 or anything like that. But it appeared that the Andres murder was just something to be accomplished, while the Covington murder showed a greater violence, and the Smith family was\u2014well, pure rage. And, yes, I know, escalating violence is often part of the profile of a serial killer, but, in this instance, I can\u2019t help but think there are distinct two killers.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Sam expectantly.</p><p>\u201cI thought that myself today,\u201d he told her.</p><p>They both looked at Jackson, who nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo, we think that Andy Yates and Samantha Yeager are having an affair\u2014and that they\u2019re making sure that they each have an alibi for murder?\u201d Angela clarified, a statement more than a question.</p><p>\u201cIt is a theory,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cA good one,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cI know that Michael Newbury, Jr., believes that David Yates has been disappointed in his father, that he believes his father hasn\u2019t stood up for him enough. What better way to prove your love than kill the family of and incarcerate the boy who supposedly gave David the evil eye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the others?\u201d Angela mused.</p><p>\u201cPeter Andres\u2014because he chastised David Yates,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Earnest Covington?\u201d Jamie asked. \u201cWhat did he do to anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that instance, I believe that he was just there, collateral damage. He was in the community. The trail for finding out who had killed Peter Andres was growing cold. Bring it close to the Smith home\u2014and have a son who will swear that he saw Malachi come out of the house\u2014and you have a good fall guy. I think that the Earnest Covington murder was a setup, and when that didn\u2019t work, the family had to go. And Earnest Covington was such an easy mark. He lived alone. He never locked his door,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cAnd the man in the graveyard tonight?\u201d Jamie demanded.</p><p>Sam sighed. \u201cEven John Alden will be looking for a trail on that. But,\u201d he told Jackson, \u201cyou should get your computer whiz on it. I have a feeling that we\u2019re not going to find out that any huge checks have been written. We need to look for alternate indications of money transfer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurder for hire is expensive,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>Sam\u2019s lips formed into a white line. \u201cExpensive? That\u2019s relative. Apparently, the guy from the cemetery was on crack. The kind that will make you do just about anything for money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what was it going to achieve?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cJenna\u2019s death?\u201d Sam stared at Jenna and let out a soft sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t know if our killers know what you all do, with ghosts and spirits and all that...but I do think that the killer is afraid of her. He or she\u2014or they\u2014 believe that she can see more than most people, somehow.\u201d</p><p>Of course, when they eventually went to bed, they didn\u2019t sleep, not right away. Jenna wondered if her own brush with the edge of an ax had made her more appreciative of living that night.</p><p>She and Sam made love until exhausted, and as they lay together she wondered what he was thinking.</p><p>\u201cThanks, by the way,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelping me out with Jamie.\u201d</p><p>He was silent, and she wondered if her time with him was ending soon. Sad, for in such a short time she had realized that he was what she wanted desperately. Sam was the reason she\u2019d never been serious before\u2014she\u2019d been looking for someone just like him, with his eccentricities, and his sense of honor and ethics. She cared far too deeply. He had what she needed in a man, and she was falling in love, even with his arrogance.</p><p>Sam rolled over to look at her. His eyes were deep and serious.</p><p>\u201cDo you still think I\u2019m a jerk?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d she said, threading her fingers through his hair, smiling.</p><p>\u201cGood. Because sometimes I still find you scary as hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I see ghosts and have postcognition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...because I thought I was going to die tonight when I believed you might have been struck by an ax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always out there on the front line,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an attorney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, now...that\u2019s the truth, and not the truth. Last I heard, you defended a man who was entangled with the mob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe son of a mobster, and he was innocent. That\u2019s different.... I don\u2019t know if I can bear being with you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. Because I don\u2019t know if I can bear not being with you.\u201d</p><p>She rolled into his arms. He held her against him. \u201cOn this one, though, will you give in to me? Will you promise not to try to slip into the school? Call it silly, I have this weird premonition about tomorrow. I want you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t slip into the school tomorrow,\u201d she told him.</p><p>She felt guilty, because she had no intention of telling him what she really was going to do. But they were going in circles. And she thought that she knew the way to end it.</p><p>\u201cThis is even crazier,\u201d he murmured, rising above her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m falling in love with you,\u201d he said.</p><p>She pulled him down to her. \u201cI like crazy,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>John Alden was true to his word; he was at the school, which had been in lockdown over the weekend. When Sam and Jackson arrived in the morning, the wardrobe mistress\u2014the drama coach\u2014swore up and down that Martin Keller had been telling the truth about the inventory, but other than that, she couldn\u2019t vouch for what might have happened with the costume earlier.</p><p>Some of the parents were at the school; although the boys that Sam really wanted questioned were the seventeen-year-olds, he had nothing against the parents being present.</p><p>Joshua Abbott was brought in to speak with John, Sam and Jackson alone\u2014without David Yates there to tell him what to say or give him leading gestures. Just when they were about to begin, Joshua\u2019s father, Ben, arrived.</p><p>Sam thought that he\u2019d be belligerent, angry that his son was being questioned. But Ben Abbott was just the opposite.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Joshua! This is serious. Perjury. You follow that Yates kid around like a puppy, but you straighten out right now. You want to go to college? You want a football scholarship\u2014you want a life? You\u2019re not in any pact with David Yates. You\u2019re just a kid, and he\u2019s just a kid, and the two of you might wind up with jail time. Tell the truth!\u201d</p><p>Joshua looked at his father miserably and lowered his head.</p><p>\u201cDid you see Malachi Smith leave Earnest Covington\u2019s house the day he was murdered?\u201d Sam asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cThe truth!\u201d Ben Abbott repeated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Joshua said. Then he looked up. \u201cI mean\u2014I didn\u2019t actually see him, but David did. And David wouldn\u2019t say that he saw him if he didn\u2019t. He said that people might not believe him if someone else didn\u2019t say the same thing. And then...then I had to stick to it because...because I\u2019d said it, and I couldn\u2019t turn on David and...Dad! Dad, I\u2019m sorry. But David wouldn\u2019t lie to me\u2014we\u2019re friends.\u201d</p><p>With that, John, Sam and Jackson thanked Joshua for his honesty and stepped out of the room. \u201cJohn, listen to me, please, and I know that this is hard. I honestly believe that Councilman Yates and Samantha Yeager conspired to commit these murders,\u201d Sam said once the door had closed.</p><p>John stared at him as if he\u2019d lost his mind. Sam spoke quickly, with Jackson\u2019s help, explaining that it was his belief that Samantha Yeager had engaged in an affair with Andy Yates. On her part, it was sheer greed. She wanted Lexington House. Andy Yates had watched what he thought was his son\u2019s terrible suffering; he had to right a wrong.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy!\u201d John said, looking at him.</p><p>\u201cJohn, help us out here, please. Half the parents are here. Can you get Andy Yates to come down? If we can all talk to him with his son present...?\u201d</p><p>John sighed. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll get him down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to what?\u201d Angela demanded.</p><p>\u201cI want to get back into Lexington House,\u201d Jenna repeated.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Jenna, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s necessary. Why don\u2019t we wait and see what happens at the school today? When they actually get to the kids...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Angela, I\u2019ve been twice. The first time, I saw Eli Lexington kill his family. The second time, I saw the day that the Braden son killed his parents. My cognitive self might be working in a time pattern. If I can get back in there one more time...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right. But, still\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we wait, Sam will have to call John again, and what I\u2019ll probably get won\u2019t actually be proof, just an idea of the direction we should take to find proof. They\u2019re about to go in with cleaning crews. We\u2019ve got to go now\u2014before they do that,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still uneasy about it. The killers are out there. They hired people to look for you, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they wouldn\u2019t dare do it again, not so quickly,\u201d Jenna said.</p> <p>While Angela drummed her fingers on the table, Jenna\u2019s phone rang. It was Sam.</p><p>\u201cJoshua Abbott\u2019s dad came in and gave it to him, and he admitted he\u2019d been lying,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt gets better. John is bringing Councilman Yates in, saying that he wants him present when David is questioned. You never know what happens when you get that kind of dichotomy going. We could get somewhere today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d Jenna told him. \u201cKeep us posted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d he said, and hung up.</p><p>\u201cNo one is going to be out to get me,\u201d Jenna assured Angela. \u201cThey\u2019re bringing Councilman Yates to the school.\u201d</p><p>Angela nodded. \u201cMaybe the ghosts will talk to me, too, today....\u201d She groaned and rolled her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go under the police tape, huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll put it back, just the way it was. No one will ever know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jamie?\u201d Angela whispered.</p><p>\u201cHe went back in to spend some time with Malachi. Angela, I feel that I have to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Angela agreed. \u201cThen...let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Jenna drove. As they pulled out of Jamie\u2019s driveway and headed down the street, Angela frowned and looked into the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a car following us,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, never mind. It was just a woman, I think, on her cell phone and following too close. The car turned off. We\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>Jenna was careful to park a few blocks down on the street. As they exited the car, Angela said, \u201cIf I head to the cliff area\u2014the park-not-really-a-park\u2014I can easily see Lexington House. I\u2019m thinking that I should keep an eye out and warn you if someone does come. And then, after you\u2019ve taken a try at reading the place, I can go in, because I want to see if there are ghosts in there who will talk to me.\u201d She smiled apologetically. \u201cWe both know that ghosts are as strange and moody as\u2014well, as they were when they were living. And sometimes, they\u2019ll feel an affinity with one person and not another. You can keep watch and I\u2019ll go in if you don\u2019t get anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh! Now there\u2019s a plan,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>In front of Lexington House, they split, moving quickly. Jenna looked around; the neighboring houses were few, and she was pretty sure that the workday had already begun for most people in the area.</p><p>She didn\u2019t try to slink into the house, but went straight up the walkway, slipped under the tape and jimmied the lock open.</p><p>FBI training was helpful in many ways, she thought.</p><p>She entered the foyer. She started to head into the parlor but changed her mind. In the parlor, too many events had occurred. She walked up the stairs. If she stood in one of the rooms where Malachi\u2019s great-uncle and grandmother had been killed, she might get more.</p><p>She chose the left bedroom, and as she stood there, she felt the opaque mist start to form before her eyes, the thing that told her she was about to see.</p><p>She gripped the bedpost and waited for the scene to start to unfold.</p><p>And it did.</p><p>She saw an old woman. She might have been out of the past; she wore a nightcap and a long white nightgown, one that buttoned to her throat. But she wasn\u2019t from the distant past. There was a digital alarm clock by her bed, and she checked it to make sure that it was set for six the following morning.</p><p>Then she lay down, and reached into her bedside table for her Bible.</p><p>Smiling, deep into the comfort of her mattress and her covers, she began to read.</p><p>Jenna felt something by her side. She turned, and there it was, the specter of the horned god, bearing an ax.</p><p>An ax that already dripped blood.</p><p>The old woman looked up. Confusion tinged her rheumy eyes at first.</p><p>And then she started to scream. A silent scream, because she couldn\u2019t quite draw breath.</p><p>And then the horned god was upon her, the first swing catching her in the center of her breast....</p><p>Something seemed to happen then. The opaque image faded; she could see it, but more as a backdrop to something else.</p><p>And there was something else there.</p><p>Another image, standing at the side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cRebecca?\u201d Jenna breathed. She was facing a ghost, or a spirit, a gentle, benign spirit. And the woman was speaking to her.</p><p>\u201cThe children, the children hear the words of their elders. Leave! Leave now!\u201d</p><p>Jenna hadn\u2019t come unarmed this time. She started to reach beneath her jacket from her weapon.</p><p>And that\u2019s when the entire world seemed to come down on her head, and she whirled only quickly enough to see who had come upon her.</p><p>The horned god, once again....</p><p>Andy Yates and his son were seated in uncomfortable chairs; Jackson had purposely found those that had uneven legs for reasons of interrogation strategy. The light was made as bright as possible, and John Alden faced the table while Jackson and Sam took chairs at each end.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Andy Yates said, bewildered. \u201cA costume was taken from this school and used when Peter Andres was killed? And so you\u2019re questioning all the students\u2014not just David, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Mr. Yates,\u201d John Alden said.</p><p>\u201cWe were at a football game when Andres was killed,\u201d he said. \u201cI know you can check that out\u2014you\u2019ve probably checked that out. So\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, we also know that David has lied to us,\u201d Sam interrupted.</p><p>Andy frowned, looking at his son.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t lie!\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cYour friend, Joshua, admitted that he didn\u2019t see Malachi Smith on the day that Earnest Covington was killed,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d David protested. \u201cJoshua wouldn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d John Alden said. They\u2019d agreed to keep the questions coming from around the table. Like uncomfortable chairs, question being shot from all directions helped confuse a person who was lying.</p><p>\u201cWait! What does the costume used when Andres was killed have to do with the day Covington was killed?\u201d Yates demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou see, we\u2019re not looking for one killer. We believe there were two, working in unison to make sure they could provide alibis for the murders,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cWait, wait,\u201d Andy Yates protested. \u201cYou think that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Yates. We think your boy might be guilty,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cWe think he\u2019s in a conspiracy with someone else,\u201d John Alden said.</p><p>David gasped. \u201cMe! I didn\u2019t murder anyone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you lied!\u201d Sam told him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill anyone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did lie!\u201d his father said, looking at his son with a sick expression.</p><p>\u201cI lied to protect you!\u201d David Yates said.</p><p>\u201cMe!\u201d Yates sounded astounded.</p><p>\u201cI saw\u2014I saw\u2014\u201d David said. \u201cYou saw what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw... I thought it was you...heading into the costume shop after the play last spring. You and mom were there, and then you weren\u2019t, and I thought you just went to speak to the drama teacher, ask her why I didn\u2019t have a better role.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never!\u201d Andy protested, staring at his son.</p><p>\u201cMr. Yates, are you having an affair with your business partner, Samantha Yeager?\u201d John demanded. \u201cYou hated Malachi Smith. You blamed him for every problem your son ever had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou blamed him for the stigma of having to see a shrink,\u201d Jackson said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019d have done anything for Samantha Yeager!\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014what?

They\u2019d been wrong. They\u2019d been close, but they\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>He jerked out of his chair and headed into the hallway. He hadn\u2019t wanted Jenna here today; somehow, he\u2019d just felt she was in danger. He\u2019d been worried sick last night.</p> <p>But she should be at Jamie\u2019s house\u2014safe. Unless someone called on her.</p><p>He dialed quickly. The phone rang and rang, and her voice mail came on.

He reached his car, and he didn\u2019t know where he was going. Jackson slid in beside him. He started to jerk the car into gear, and stopped.</p><p>There was an old woman standing in front of him. An old woman in costume. Hell, it was Halloween.</p><p>\u201cGet out of the way, get out of the way, get out of the way\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho are you talking to?

Jackson, get her out of the way before I run her down!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one\u2014\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWhat does she look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld. Dressed to the throat. In a cap\u2014what are you talking about? She\u2019s right there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s just there for you. Start the car. She\u2019ll move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me again, who does she look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn old Puritan woman!\u201d Sam exploded. \u201cDamn you, Jackson, no one is answering a phone. I can\u2019t reach either Angela or Jenna. And it\u2019s not Andy Yates who\u2019s a killer\u2014it\u2019s his wife!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDrive!\u201d Jackson said. \u201cAnd follow her\u2014she\u2019s here to lead you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife for the innocent.\u201d</p><p>Jenna came to slowly and saw a horned god hovering over her. She tried to move, but couldn\u2019t. She realized that she\u2019d been tied to the sofa downstairs, that she was lying in the chalk outline that denoted the place Abraham Smith had been killed.</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have let well enough be?\u201d the horned god asked her. \u201cI never wanted to hurt you...I didn\u2019t want more dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Cindy!\u201d someone behind her said. Jenna knew the voice.</p><p>It was that of Samantha Yeager.</p><p>\u201cWhy? We both came in from the back,\u201d Cindy Yates said, impatient. She pulled off the mask of the horned god and looked at Jenna, serious anxiety in her eyes. \u201cHe really is evil, you know. Malachi Smith is evil. His father was evil. This house makes everyone in it evil, you have to understand that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCindy, come on!\u201d Samantha said. She was wearing the horned god\u2019s cape, like Cindy, but she hadn\u2019t bothered with a mask. \u201cGet a grip! We need to get this over with. I have to get back to the shop or I won\u2019t have an alibi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re not going to chop her up,\u201d Cindy said. \u201cIt has to be an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be an accident. My partner\u2019s on the cliff right now, watching the house,\u201d Jenna said. Her head hurt. Her mouth seemed to be working only with great effort.</p><p>Samantha Yeager chuckled and leaned over her. \u201cNo, honey, she\u2019s not watching anything right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better pray that you didn\u2019t kill Angela,\u201d Jenna said, trying to keep calm. Except that she had panicked at first and jerked against her binding.</p><p>It was loose. And they hadn\u2019t bothered to tie her legs.</p><p>\u201cIf you hurt her, you\u2019ll have to watch out for Jackson Crow. He\u2019s part Native American, you know. He learned all sorts of unique tortures from his father\u2019s family,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s bluffing, the wicked little bitch!\u201d Samantha said, hunkering down beside her. She lifted a strand of Jenna\u2019s hair. \u201cBut your ol\u2019 Indian pal won\u2019t have to be upset\u2014your friend will be okay. I got her with a slingshot from the woods\u2014I was ready from the minute Cindy saw you on the move and called me. Slingshot! I\u2019m good at it, by the way. Like I am with so many things...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike making men think that you want them?\u201d Jenna suggested, carefully inching around in the ties that bound her.</p><p>She\u2019d hit pay dirt. She eased back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only fair,\u201d Cindy said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s only fair?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, my husband! My fine, upstanding husband!\u201d she said. \u201cOur son is attacked, and what does he do? He sends him for psychiatric care! A real man would have gone to battle for his child! He would have done something about Abraham and Malachi Smith existing in the same world as our David. He should have done something. But, no! He looked at my boy, my beautiful, strong, handsome boy, and said that he needed help! What kind of a father does that?\u201d she demanded. \u201cAnd then, oh, he\u2019s such a smarmy bastard! He meets Samantha, and what the hell does he do? He comes on to her! He brought her into our house, introduced her to me and my children, and then came on to her. He\u2019s such a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fool with money,\u201d Samantha murmured.</p><p>\u201cIf he weren\u2019t,\u201d Cindy said, her eyes narrowing, \u201cI\u2019d have been out of that house by now. And then you come into town and start sleeping with that sleazy lawyer! Bringing your hotshot FBI friends. And when I challenge you, what does my smarmy bastard of a husband do? He yells at me! He yells at me for slapping you, you bitch!\u201d</p><p>As if suddenly realizing that her husband wasn\u2019t around to yell at her now, she slapped Jenna. Hard. And then again and again. The blows were stinging, but Jenna used the time to work harder at the ropes binding her.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d Samantha warned her. \u201cWe have to figure out exactly how to make this look like an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you did with Milton Sedge?\u201d Jenna asked, running her tongue over her lips and tasting blood.</p><p>\u201cThat was me,\u201d Cindy said proudly. \u201cSamantha did in Mr. Andres\u2014with my compliments, of course\u2014and I took care of the rest. They deserved to die! The Smiths deserved to die! They were horrible people. Don\u2019t you understand? They were evil!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCindy!\u201d Samantha pleaded.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter what we tell her now?\u201d Cindy asked softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Earnest Covington? How the hell could you butcher him like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to! Don\u2019t you understand? I had to. They had to lock up Malachi!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCindy! Stop it, please. Come on, and move! I\u2019ve got to get her head cracked in and then leave her at the foot of the stairs. You wanted to talk to her\u2014to explain. You\u2019ve done it. We\u2019ve got to get rid of her now, Cindy. Come away!\u201d</p><p>Cindy started to rise. It might be Jenna\u2019s last chance.</p><p>Jenna knew that she couldn\u2019t tear free from the bonds holding her, but she might be able to use her legs to help her get free. She jerked up with all her might, chair still strapped to her back and arms, desperately finding her balance in split seconds. She had no choice of weapon or flexibility: she head-bashed Cindy, causing her to cry out and fall back.</p><p>\u201cOh, screw this!\u201d Samantha cried, and she reached for the old lamp on the table and started to bring it down on Jenna\u2019s head.</p><p>Jenna threw herself down and managed to avoid the first crash by tumbling awkwardly away. Her head was still ringing; it felt like it was a thousand pounds itself, and the wood chair slats and rope hurt her skin.</p><p>\u201cCindy, help!\u201d Samantha raged.</p><p>Cindy staggered to her feet.</p><p>Samantha picked up one of the heavy candlesticks from the mantel.</p><p>She raced toward Jenna; Jenna ducked the blow.</p><p>Cindy came up behind her with the remnants of the lamp, striking her hard. She willed herself not to feel the pain. She still had no weapon but the force of her own body.</p><p>She threw herself on Cindy, taking her down.</p><p>Samantha reached for Jenna, grasping a handful of her hair and viciously pulling her up. She rammed Samantha, but Cindy rose.</p><p>And Jenna realized that her strength was failing. She fell to her knees, hunched over, the chair covering her somewhat.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t want to die....</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here!\u201d she exclaimed suddenly. \u201cAbraham Smith is here...and all those who have died at the hands of others. They\u2019re all here, watching you!\u201d</p><p>Jenna had wanted the exclamation to spook the women, but she found that she wasn\u2019t actually lying\u2014the ghosts of the deceased had gathered in the room to watch them.</p><p>As if sensing something herself, Cindy stood still in fear, shaking. \u201cWhere, where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNowhere!\u201d Samantha cried. \u201cHelp me, Cindy.\u201d</p><p>She had retrieved the candlestick and went at Jenna again.</p><p>\u201cAbraham, no!\u201d Jenna called, seeing that the ghost was going to do his best to trip Samantha. \u201cLet the law punish them, and it will be years and years...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d Samantha shrieked. But coming forward, she tripped and landed inches from Jenna, who pivoted on her knees to hit the woman with the legs of her chair. \u201cCindy, help, she\u2019ll kill me!\u201d</p><p>Cindy cried out herself, lifting the coffee table, ready to hurl it at Jenna.</p><p>But, before she could, a whirlwind rushed into the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was Sam. He put his arms around Cindy and threw her to the ground, the table landing with a loud crash. At that moment, Jenna became aware of the sound of sirens coming closer. Samantha rose one more time to come after her.</p><p>Jenna felt lightness in her head, and she knew she was going to faint, with darkness and stars bursting before her eyes.</p><p>But Sam ran in her direction, and his arm snaked around Samantha before she could strike. He lifted her off her feet, swinging her around to crash land on top of Cindy.</p><p>\u201cI always knew you wanted to touch me, honey,\u201d Samantha said, dazed.</p> <p>Then Jenna saw no more. The stars in front of her eyes burst, and then became blackness.</p><p>Waking up, Jenna felt a bit as if she were on display.</p><p>There were so many people staring at her.</p><p>A doctor in a white uniform and a stethoscope in his hand. A concerned nurse in a pert white hat. Uncle Jamie, Jackson, Angela, Will, John Alden\u2014and Sam.</p><p>Sam was seated by her side on the bed, holding her hand. His gray eyes were so misted with concern that it seemed her heart ached, rather than her head.</p> <p>\u201cAh, you\u2019re back with us again,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cWell, that was a pretty good wallop you got on your head, and I know you\u2019re an R.N., Miss Duffy, but you\u2019re staying right here tonight, you understand. You should know that a good concussion is definitely something to watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you be worrying!\u201d Jamie said. \u201cThe lass will be staying right here, till you say that it\u2019s fine for her to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDitto,\u201d Sam said sternly, squeezing her hand.</p><p>\u201cMay we have just a minute?\u201d John Alden asked.</p><p>\u201cA minute!\u201d the doctor said sternly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving at all,\u201d Sam said. He looked at the doctor. \u201cI\u2019ll be good, I swear. I\u2019m just going to sit here and make sure she doesn\u2019t try to get up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right, but not too much stimulation\u2014the rest of you out of here in two minutes!\u201d the doctor said firmly.</p><p>When he was gone, John Alden said, \u201cJenna, I just want to say\u2014well, I just want to say that the women are both locked up, and\u2014\u201d he paused, shaking his head with a smile and looking at Jamie \u201c\u2014and the prosecutor has already gone in to see that the charges against Malachi Smith are dropped. Of course, now he has to press charges against Samantha Yeager and Cindy Yates, and you will be called to testify in court, and God knows, Sam may be defending them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sam said. \u201cSam won\u2019t be defending them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knew?\u201d Jamie said quietly. \u201cWho knew that a woman like Cindy could go quite so crazy over the perceived injury done a child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we did think that maybe Andy Yates was that furious,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think that a mother would resort to that kind of violence. That\u2019s still the way of the world\u2014we don\u2019t like to think that the female of our species can be so violent and diabolical. And I sure didn\u2019t suspect that the affair was with Cindy Yates, not Andy,\u201d Jackson said apologetically.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, Angela!\u201d Jenna tried to sit up to address her friend.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d the word was a cacophony from the entire group, and Sam gently pushed her back down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine\u2014absolutely fine,\u201d Angela told her. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed, frankly. I was armed and everything. The rock came from the trees the minute I turned to watch the house. But, honestly, I was already getting up when Jackson came rushing over for me. So much for my intelligent stakeout.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey would have just gotten us both inside,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Angela said. \u201cAnd maybe not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Jackson said, \u201cour two minutes are up. We can go through all of it later\u2014when you\u2019re up to it. Come on, everyone out. Jenna, you get your rest, and don\u2019t you dare try to get up again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Jenna said. She looked at her uncle. \u201cHow is Malachi?\u201d</p><p>Jamie smiled. \u201cMalachi is just fine. We had a long talk on the phone, and I\u2019ll go and pick him up when I leave here. I\u2019m making arrangements for him to do his senior year at a boarding school in New Hampshire\u2014one that has an extensive music department. He wants to pursue a career in music. He has the guitar now, and while I\u2019m getting him situated, he\u2019ll have the piano at my house. We\u2019ll see his name in the newspapers again, I\u2019ll warrant. In the entertainment section. He\u2019s going to make it. He\u2019ll have support now, and belief. Music, he told me, is his gift from God. Who knows? Maybe he\u2019ll become the singing priest! A nun made it that way, once!\u201d</p><p>Jenna nodded and leaned back, smiling.</p><p>Jamie kissed her cheek, then Angela and Jackson. Apparently, John Alden would have felt left out if he hadn\u2019t, so he did, as well.</p><p>She caught his hand. \u201cThanks for being a good cop, John,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to believe any of you,\u201d he said. \u201cMe. The man who should have learned the most from the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an exceptionally good cop because you were willing to be honest and not blindly insist that you were right. You\u2019re a good cop because you pursued justice, not ego,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He grinned, kissed her cheek again and left.</p><p>And she was alone with Sam.</p><p>\u201cWait until you\u2019re well,\u201d he told her, moving closer and holding her fingers tenderly. \u201cSuch a brat, still! You were supposed to be at the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said I wouldn\u2019t go to Lexington House,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cBrat. Omission is as good as a lie.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, not looking at him. \u201cI\u2019m just grateful that you came. I learned something, of course. Anyone can be taken by surprise. I\u2019m pretty good, but... Cindy might have been the one to commit the most vicious murders, but Samantha is one mean opponent! How the hell did you find us?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI figured it out when David and Andy Yates were together,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew where they were\u2014but I didn\u2019t know where Samantha and Cindy were. I tried calling you. You didn\u2019t answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014did you just figure I would have gone to Lexington House?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He lowered his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he answered after a minute.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone showed me the way. I think she\u2019s a friend of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca Nurse.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him in astonishment. \u201cI\u2014I thought she was just an old woman in the way, but Jackson didn\u2019t see her. He said that she was there for me...and to follow her. And I did.\u201d He was thoughtful. \u201cShe knew how easy it was for even good, sane people to believe what others said, I believe. Maybe\u2014maybe she stays, making sure that others don\u2019t follow the same route\u2014making sure that history matters.\u201d</p><p>Jenna could barely believe what he was saying\u2014and that he meant the words, earnestly.</p><p>\u201cShe kept telling me that children listened to their parents. And they did; David Yates knew that his mother loathed the Smiths. He knew, too, that his father wanted them out of the area. And I think he was terrified that his father was a murderer, and he had to keep saying what he did so that nothing happened to his family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat boy is going to need a lot of help,\u201d Sam said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Malachi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think your uncle is going to become his guardian. He was already saying that he wanted to get him down to New York or out West, maybe. He wants to put him in a good music school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, he needs to meet Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake, Jake! I don\u2019t want to hear about this Jake.\u201d</p><p>Jenna tried not to laugh; laughing did still hurt.</p><p>\u201cJake has got a gorgeous fianc\u00e9e, so not to worry. But he\u2019s an incredible musician. I think he and Malachi really must meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Virginia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Jake is in Virginia now.\u201d</p><p>He raised the hand he was holding in both of his, and kissed her fingers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve actually been thinking that Virginia, the capital region, is really a phenomenal place for a truly renowned attorney to set up shop. Think of the graft! Think of the slimy politicians! Think of the masses, where crime just happens. I am considering looking into it. That is, if you think I should?\u201d</p><p>He could push her back down if he chose, but she had to rise for a minute. She held on to his shoulders and kissed his lips.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that I could bear it if you didn\u2019t,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>They let Jenna out on Halloween morning.</p><p>She was delighted, but while the city was going crazy with talk and newspaper articles and the news on television, the last thing any of them wanted to do was join in the crowd.</p><p>Still, Jenna wasn\u2019t ready to leave Salem. She and Sam spent the night at Jamie\u2019s house, dispensing candy during the early hours, and just enjoying each other\u2019s company the night through.</p><p>The next day, Sam was the one who wanted to get an appointment to see the Rebecca Nurse homestead.</p><p>They arrived right at dusk, and he headed straight to the graveyard with Jenna at his side.</p><p>At first they saw nothing.</p><p>And then they saw her as the mist fell with the coming twilight. She said nothing; she smiled at them and vanished into the fog. Sam knelt by her memorial marker and placed a spray of daisies there.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>He rose then, and took Jenna\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cVirginia, eh? So I get to meet Jake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his fianc\u00e9e, Ashley. And Whitney and her new husband. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam Harrison?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I get to wake up every morning with you?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cYes. Well, every morning unless we\u2019re on a case. Sometimes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, I\u2019ll be on a case!\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYes, but you know\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u201cShut up while we\u2019re both ahead.

This was begun by the hearty seafarers who came to the New England shores, fishermen, whalers, pirates and more. There are many variations, of course, but rum was the drink of the New World, and it was allotted to seamen. To stretch it out, improve taste and perhaps keep from falling overboard, seamen began to add things to rum. Sugar, because sugar is sweet. Fruit, because fruit is sweet\u2014and keeps those at sea clear of the dreaded scourge of scurvy! </p>  </body></html>"]
