Don\u2019t panic. It\u2019s simply a question of being organized and staying calm and deciding what exactly I need to take. And then fitting it all neatly into my suitcase. I mean, just how hard can that be?</p><p>I step back from my cluttered bed and close my eyes, half-hoping that if I wish hard enough, my clothes might magically organize themselves into a series of neatly folded piles. Like in those magazine articles on packing, which tell you how to go on holiday with one cheap sarong and cleverly turn it into six different outfits. (Which I always think is a complete con, because, OK, the sarong costs ten quid, but then they add loads of accessories which cost hundreds, and we\u2019re not supposed to notice.)</p><p>But when I open my eyes again, the clutter is all still there. In fact, there seems to be even more of it, as if while my eyes were shut, my clothes have been secretly jumping out of the drawers and running around on my bed. Everywhere I look, there are huge great tangled piles of... well... stuff. Shoes, boots, Tshirts, magazines... a Body Shop gift basket that was on sale... a Linguaphone Italian course which I\u2019m definitely going to start soon... a facial sauna thingy... And, sitting proudly on my dressing table, a fencing mask and sword which I bought yesterday. Only forty quid from a charity shop!</p> <p>I pick up the sword and experimentally give a little lunge toward my reflection in the mirror. It was a real coincidence, because I\u2019ve been meaning to take up fencing for ages, ever since I read this article about it in The Daily World. Did you know that fencers have better legs than any other athletes? Plus, if you\u2019re an expert you can become a stunt double in a film and earn loads of money! So what I\u2019m planning to do is find some fencing lessons nearby, and get really good, which I should think I\u2019ll do quite quickly.</p><p>And then \u2014 this is my secret little plan \u2014 when I\u2019ve got my gold badge, or whatever it is, I\u2019ll write to Catherine Zeta-Jones. Because she must need a stunt double, mustn\u2019t she? And why shouldn\u2019t it be me? In fact she\u2019d probably prefer someone British. Maybe she\u2019ll phone back and say she always watches my television appearances on cable, and she\u2019s always wanted to meet me! We\u2019ll probably really hit it off, and turn out to have the same sense of humor and everything. And then I\u2019ll fly out to her luxury home, and get to meet Michael Douglas and play with the baby. We\u2019ll be all relaxed together like old friends, and some magazine will do a feature on celebrity best friends and have us in it, and maybe they\u2019ll even ask me to be...</p><p>\u201cHi, Bex!\u201d With a jolt, the happy pictures of me laughing with Michael and Catherine vanish, and my brain snaps into focus. Suze, my flatmate, is wandering into my room, wearing a pair of ancient paisley pajamas, with her blond hair in plaits. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asks curiously.</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d I say, hastily putting the fencing sword back. \u201cJust... you know. Keep fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d she says vaguely. \u201cSo \u2014 how\u2019s the packing going?\u201d She wanders over to my mantelpiece, picks up a lipstick, and begins to apply it. Suze always does this in my room \u2014 just wanders about picking things up and looking at them and putting them down again. She says she loves the way you never know what you might find, like in a junk shop. Which I\u2019m fairly sure she means in a nice way.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going really well,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m just deciding which suitcase to take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh,\u201d says Suze, turning round, her mouth half bright pink. \u201cWhat about that little cream one? Or your red holdall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe this one,\u201d I say, hauling my new acid-green shell case out from under the bed. I bought it last weekend, and it\u2019s absolutely gorgeous.</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d says Suze, her eyes widening. \u201cBex! That\u2019s fab! Where did you get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFenwicks,\u201d I say, grinning broadly. \u201cIsn\u2019t it amazing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the coolest case I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d says Suze, running her fingers admiringly over it. \u201cSo... how many suitcases have you got now?\u201d She glances up at my wardrobe, on which are teetering a brown leather case, a lacquered trunk, and three vanity cases.</p> <p>\u201cOh, you know,\u201d I say, shrugging a little defensively. \u201cThe normal amount.\u201d</p><p>I suppose I have been buying quite a bit of luggage recently. But the thing is, for ages I didn\u2019t have any, just one battered old canvas bag. Then, a few months ago I had an incredible revelation in the middle of Harrods, a bit like Saint Paul on the road to Mandalay. Luggage. And since then, I\u2019ve been making up for all the lean years. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Besides which, everyone knows good luggage is an investment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just making a cup of tea,\u201d says Suze. \u201cD\u2019you want one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, yes please!\u201d I say. \u201cAnd a KitKat?\u201d Suze grins.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely a KitKat.\u201d</p> <p>Recently, we had this friend of Suze\u2019s to stay on our sofa \u2014 and when he left he gave us this huge box full of a hundred KitKats. Which is such a great thank-you present, but it means all we eat, all day long, is KitKats. Still, as Suze pointed out last night, the quicker we eat them, the quicker they\u2019ll be gone \u2014 so in a way, it\u2019s healthier just to stuff in as many as possible right away.</p><p>Suze ambles out of the room and I turn to my case. Right. Concentrate. Packing. This really shouldn\u2019t take long. All I need is a very basic, pared-down capsule wardrobe for a romantic minibreak in Somerset. I\u2019ve even written out a list, which should make things nice and simple.</p><p>Jeans: two pairs. Easy. Scruffy and not quite so scruffy.</p><p>Tshirts:</p><p>Actually, make that three pairs of jeans. I\u2019ve got to take my new Diesel ones, they\u2019re just so cool, even if they are a bit tight. I\u2019ll just wear them for a few hours in the evening or something.</p> <p>Tshirts:</p><p>Oh, and my embroidered cutoffs from Oasis, because I haven\u2019t worn them yet. But they don\u2019t really count because they\u2019re practically shorts. And anyway, jeans hardly take up any room, do they?</p><p>OK, that\u2019s probably enough jeans. I can always add some more if I need to.</p><p>Tshirts: selection. So let\u2019s see. Plain white, obviously. Gray, ditto. Black cropped, black vest (Calvin Klein), other black vest (Warehouse, but actually looks nicer), pink sleeveless, pink sparkly, pink\u2014</p><p>I stop, halfway through transferring folded-up Tshirts into my case. This is stupid. How am I supposed to predict which Tshirts I\u2019m going to want to wear? The whole point about Tshirts is you choose them in the morning according to your mood, like crystals, or aromatherapy oils. Imagine if I woke up in the mood for my \u201cElvis Is Groovy\u201d T-shirt and I didn\u2019t have it with me?</p><p>You know, I think I\u2019ll just take them all. I mean, a few Tshirts aren\u2019t going to take up much room. I\u2019ll hardly even notice them.</p> <p>I tip them all into my case and add a couple of cropped bra-tops for luck.</p><p>Excellent. This capsule approach is working really well. OK, what\u2019s next?</p><p>Ten minutes later, Suze wanders back into the room, holding two mugs of tea and three KitKats to share. (We\u2019ve come to agree that four sticks, frankly, doesn\u2019t do it.)</p><p>\u201cHere you are,\u201d she says \u2014 then gives me a closer look. \u201cBex, are you OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say, rather pink in the face. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to fold up this insulated vest a bit smaller.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve already packed a denim jacket and a leather jacket, but you just can\u2019t count on September weather, can you? I mean, at the moment it\u2019s hot and sunny, but it might well start snowing tomorrow. And what happens if Luke and I go for a really rustic country walk? Besides which, I\u2019ve had this gorgeous Patagonia vest for ages, and I\u2019ve only worn it once. I try to fold it again, but it slithers out of my hands and onto the floor. God, this reminds me of camping trips with the Brownies, trying to get my sleeping bag back into its tube.</p><p>\u201cHow long are you going for, again?\u201d asks Suze.</p><p>\u201cThree days.\u201d I give up trying to squash the vest into the size of a matchbox, and it springs jauntily back to shape. Discomfited, I sink onto the bed and take a sip of tea. What I don\u2019t understand is, how do other people manage to pack so lightly? You see businesspeople all the time, striding onto planes with only a tiny shoe-box suitcase on wheels. How do they do it? Do they have magic shrinking clothes?</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take your holdall as well?\u201d suggests Suze.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you think?\u201d I look uncertainly at my overflowing suitcase. Come to think of it, maybe I don\u2019t need three pairs of boots. Or a fur stole.</p><p>Then suddenly it occurs to me that Suze goes away nearly every weekend, and she only takes a tiny squashy bag. \u201cSuze, how do you pack? Do you have a system?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d she says vaguely. \u201cI suppose I still do what they taught us at Miss Burton\u2019s. You work out an outfit for each occasion \u2014 and stick to that.\u201d She begins to tick off on her fingers. \u201cLike... driving outfit, dinner, sitting by the pool, game of tennis...\u201d She looks up. \u201cOh yes, and each garment should be used at least three times.\u201d</p><p>God, Suze is a genius. She knows all this kind of stuff. Her parents sent her to Miss Burton\u2019s Academy when she was eighteen, which is some posh place in London where they teach you things like how to talk to a bishop and get out of a sports car in a miniskirt. She knows how to make a rabbit out of chicken wire, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Quickly I start to jot some broad headings on a piece of paper.

I can hear Suze talking excitedly \u2014 then a moment later, she appears in the doorway, her face all pink and pleased.</p><p>\u201cGuess what?\u201d she says. \u201cGuess what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBox Beautiful has sold out of my frames! They just phoned up to order some more!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Suze! That\u2019s fantastic!\u201d I shriek.</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d She comes running over, and we have a big hug, and sort of dance about, before she realizes she\u2019s holding a cigarette and is about to burn my hair.</p><p>The amazing thing is, Suze only started making photograph frames a few months ago \u2014 but already she\u2019s supplying four shops in London, and they\u2019re doing really well! She\u2019s been in loads of magazines, and everything. Which isn\u2019t surprising, because her frames are so cool. Her latest range is in purple tweed, and they come in these gorgeous gray sparkly boxes, all wrapped in bright turquoise tissue paper. (I helped choose the exact color, by the way.) She\u2019s so successful, she doesn\u2019t even make them all herself anymore, but sends off her designs to a little workshop in Kent, and they come back, all made up.</p> <p>\u201cSo, have you finished working your wardrobe out?\u201d she says, taking a drag on her cigarette.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, brandishing my sheet of paper at her. \u201cI\u2019ve got it all sorted out. Down to every last pair of socks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell done!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the only thing I need to buy,\u201d I add casually, \u201cis a pair of lilac sandals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLilac sandals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d I look up innocently. \u201cYes. I need some. You know, just a nice cheap little pair to pull a couple of outfits together...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh right,\u201d says Suze, and pauses, frowning slightly. \u201cBex... weren\u2019t you talking about a pair of lilac sandals last week? Really expensive, from LK Bennett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I?\u201d I feel myself flush a little. \u201cI... I don\u2019t remember. Maybe. Anyway\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex.\u201d Suze gives me a suddenly suspicious look. \u201cNow tell me the truth. Do you really need a pair of lilac sandals? Or do you just want them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say defensively. \u201cI really need them! Look!\u201d</p><p>I take out my clothes plan, unfold it, and show it to Suze. I have to say, I\u2019m quite proud of it. It\u2019s quite a complicated flow chart, all boxes and arrows and red asterisks.</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d says Suze. \u201cWhere did you learn how to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt university,\u201d I say modestly. I got my degree in Business and Accounting \u2014 and it\u2019s amazing how often it comes in handy.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this box?\u201d she asks, pointing at the page.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s...\u201d I squint at it, trying to remember. \u201cI think that\u2019s if we go out to some really smart restaurant and I\u2019ve already worn my Whistles dress the night before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s if we go rock-climbing. And this\u201d\u2014I point to an empty box\u2014\u201cis where I need a pair of lilac sandals. If I don\u2019t have them, then this outfit won\u2019t work, and neither will this one... and the whole thing will disintegrate. I might as well not bother going.\u201d</p><p>Suze is silent for a while, perusing my clothes plan while I bite my lip anxiously and cross my fingers behind my back.</p><p>I know this may seem a little unusual. I know most people don\u2019t run every single purchase past their flatmate. But the fact is, a while ago I kind of made Suze a little promise, which was that I\u2019d let her keep tabs on my shopping. You know. Just keep an eye on things.</p><p>Don\u2019t get the wrong idea here. It\u2019s not like I have a problem or anything. It\u2019s just that a few months ago, I did get into a... Well. A very slight money scrape. It was really just a tiny blip \u2014 nothing to worry about. But Suze got really freaked out when she found out how much I owed, and said that for my own good, she\u2019d vet all my spending from now on.</p><p>And she\u2019s been as good as her word. She\u2019s very strict, actually. Sometimes I\u2019m really quite scared she might say no.</p><p>\u201cI see what you mean,\u201d she says at last. \u201cYou haven\u2019t really got a choice, have you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cExactly,\u201d I say in relief. I take the plan from her, fold it up, and put it into my bag.</p><p>\u201cHey, Bex, is that new?\u201d says Suze suddenly. She pulls my wardrobe door open and I feel a twinge of nerves. She\u2019s frowning at my lovely new honey-colored coat, which I smuggled into the flat the other day when she was in the bath.</p><p>I mean, obviously I was planning to tell her about it. I just never got round to it.</p><p>Please don\u2019t look at the price tag, I think feverishly. Please don\u2019t look at the price tag.</p> <p>\u201cErm... yes,\u201d I say. \u201cYes, it is new. But the thing is... I need a good coat, in case I get asked to do an outside broadcast for Morning Coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that likely?\u201d asks Suze, puzzledly. \u201cI mean, I thought your job was just sitting in the studio, giving financial advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... you never know. It\u2019s always best to be prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose so...\u201d says Suze doubtfully. \u201cAnd what about this top?\u201d She pulls at a hanger. \u201cThat\u2019s new, too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s to wear on the show,\u201d I reply promptly.</p> <p>\u201cAnd this skirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd these new trousers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex.\u201d Suze looks at me with narrowed eyes. \u201cHow many outfits have you got to wear on the show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell \u2014 you know,\u201d I say defensively. \u201cI need a few backups. I mean, Suze, this is my career we\u2019re talking about. My career.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Suze eventually. \u201cYes, I suppose it is.\u201d She reaches for my new red silk jacket. \u201cThis is nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I beam. \u201cI bought it to wear on my January special!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you got a January special?\u201d says Suze. \u201cOoh, what\u2019s it about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be called Becky\u2019s Fundamental Financial Principles,\u201d I say, reaching for my lip gloss. \u201cIt should be really good. Five ten-minute slots, just me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo \u2014 what are your fundamental financial principles?\u201d asks Suze interestedly.</p><p>\u201cErm... well, I haven\u2019t really got any yet,\u201d I say, carefully painting my lips. \u201cBut you know. I\u2019ll work them out a bit nearer the time.\u201d I snap my lip gloss shut and reach for my jacket. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Suze. \u201cAnd remember. Just one pair of shoes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right! I promise!\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s really sweet of Suze to be so concerned about me. But she doesn\u2019t need to be. To be honest, she doesn\u2019t really understand what a changed person I am. OK, I did have a very slight financial crisis earlier this year. In fact, at one point, I was in debt by... Well. Really quite a lot.</p><p>But then I landed my job on Morning Coffee, and everything changed. I turned my life around completely, worked really hard, and paid off all my debts. Yes, I paid them all off! I wrote out check after check \u2014 and cleared every single outstanding credit card, every store card, every scribbled IOU to Suze. (She couldn\u2019t believe it when I presented her with a check for several hundred pounds. At first she didn\u2019t want to take it, but then she changed her mind and went out and bought this most amazing sheepskin coat.)</p><p>Honestly, paying off those debts was the most wonderful, exhilarating feeling in the world. It was a few months ago now \u2014 but I still feel high as I think about it. There\u2019s really nothing to beat being completely and utterly financially solvent, is there?</p><p>And just look at me now. I\u2019m a completely different person from the old Becky. I\u2019m a reformed character. I haven\u2019t even got an overdraft!</p><p>Two</p><p>WELL, OK. I have got a bit of an overdraft. But the only reason is, I\u2019ve been taking the long view recently, and investing quite heavily in my career. Luke, my boyfriend, is an entrepreneur. He\u2019s got his own financial PR company and everything. And he said something a few weeks ago which really made sense to me: \u201cPeople who want to make a million borrow a million first.\u201d</p><p>Honestly, I must have a naturally entrepreneurial mind or something, because as soon as he said it, I felt this amazing chord of recognition. I even found myself murmuring it aloud. He\u2019s so right. How can you expect to make any money if you don\u2019t spend it first?</p><p>So I\u2019ve invested in quite a few outfits to wear on television \u2014 plus a few good haircuts, and quite a few manicures and facials. And a couple of massages. Because everyone knows you can\u2019t perform well if you\u2019re all stressed.</p><p>I\u2019ve also invested in a new computer, which cost \u00a32,000\u2014but is an essential item because guess what? I\u2019m writing a self-help book! Just after I\u2019d become a regular on Morning Coffee, I met these really nice publishers, who took me out to lunch and said I was an inspiration to financially challenged people everywhere. Wasn\u2019t that nice? They paid me \u00a31,000 before I\u2019d even written a word \u2014 and I get a lot more when it\u2019s actually published. The book\u2019s going to be called Becky Bloomwood\u2019s Guide to Money. Or possibly Manage Money the Becky Bloomwood Way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I haven\u2019t quite had time to start writing it yet, but I really think the most important thing is to get the title right, and then the rest will just fall into place.

Before each purchase, I ask myself one question: \u201cDo I need this?\u201d And only if the answer is yes do I make the purchase. It\u2019s all just a matter of self-discipline.</p><p>So, for example, when I get to LK Bennett, I\u2019m incredibly focused and direct. As I walk in, a pair of high-heeled red boots catches my eye \u2014 but I quickly look away and head straight for the display of sandals. This is how I shop these days: no pausing, no browsing, no eyeing up other items. Not even that gorgeous new range of sequined pumps over there. I simply go straight to the sandals I want, take them from the rack, and say to the assistant, \u201cI\u2019d like to have these in a six, please.\u201d</p> <p>Direct and to the point. Just buy what you need and nothing else. This is the key to controlled shopping. I\u2019m not even going to glance at those cool pink stilettos, even though they\u2019d match my new pink denim skirt perfectly.</p><p>Nor those slingbacks with the glittery heels.</p><p>They are nice though, aren\u2019t they? I wonder what they look like on?</p><p>Oh God. This is really hard.</p><p>What is it about shoes? I mean, I like most kinds of clothes, but a good pair of shoes can just reduce me to jelly. Sometimes, when Suze isn\u2019t at home, I open my wardrobe and just stare at all my pairs of shoes, like some mad collector. And once I lined them all up on my bed and took a photograph of them. Which might seem a bit weird \u2014 but I thought, I\u2019ve got loads of photos of people I don\u2019t really like, so why not take one of something I really love?</p> <p>\u201cHere you are!\u201d</p><p>Thank goodness, the assistant is back, with my lilac sandals in a box \u2014 and as I see them, my heart leaps. Oh, these are gorgeous. Gorgeous. All delicate and strappy, with a tiny little blackberry by the toe. I fell in love with them as soon as I saw them. They\u2019re a bit expensive \u2014 but then, everyone knows you should never skimp on shoes, because you\u2019ll hurt your feet.</p><p>I slip my feet into them with a frisson of delight \u2014 and they\u2019re just fantastic. My feet suddenly look elegant, and my legs look longer... and OK, it\u2019s a tiny bit difficult to walk in them, but that\u2019s probably because the shop floor is all slippery.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take them, please,\u201d I say, and beam happily at the assistant.</p><p>You see, this is the reward for taking such a controlled approach to shopping. When you buy something, you really feel as though you\u2019ve earned it.</p><p>We both head toward the checkout, and I keep my eyes carefully away from the rack of accessories. In fact, I barely even notice that purple bag with the jet beading. And I\u2019m just reaching for my wallet, congratulating myself on being so single-minded, when the assistant says conversationally, \u201cYou know, we\u2019ve got these sandals in clementine, as well.\u201d</p> <p>Clementine?</p><p>\u201cOh... right,\u201d I say after a pause.</p><p>I\u2019m not interested. I\u2019ve got what I came in to buy \u2014 and that\u2019s the end of the story. Lilac sandals. Not clementine.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve just come in,\u201d she adds, rooting around on the floor. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to be even more popular than the lilac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say, trying to sound as indifferent as I can. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll just take these, I think...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere it is!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cI knew there was one around here somewhere...\u201d</p><p>And I freeze, as she puts the most exquisite sandal I\u2019ve ever seen onto the counter. It\u2019s a pale, creamy orange color, with the same strappy shape as the lilac one \u2014 but instead of the blackberry, there\u2019s a tiny clementine by the toe.</p><p>It\u2019s instant love. I can\u2019t move my eyes away.</p> <p>\u201cWould you like to try it?\u201d says the girl, and I feel a lurch of desire, right to the pit of my stomach. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just look at it.

No.</p><p>\u201cActually...\u201d I swallow hard, trying to get control of my voice. \u201cActually...\u201d I can hardly say it. \u201cI\u2019ll just take the lilac ones today,\u201d I manage eventually. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK...\u201d The girl punches a code into the till. \u201cThat\u2019ll be \u00a389, then. How would you like to pay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... VISA, please,\u201d I say. I sign the slip, take my bag, and leave the shop, feeling slightly numb.</p><p>I did it! I did it! I completely controlled my desires! I only needed one pair of shoes \u2014 and I only bought one. In and out of the shop, completely according to plan. You see, this is what I can do when I really want to. This is the new Becky Bloomwood.</p><p>Having been so good, I deserve a little reward, so I go to a coffee shop and sit down outside in the sun with a cappuccino.</p><p>I want those clementine shoes, pops into my head as I take the first sip.</p> <p>Stop. Stop it. Think about... something else. Luke. The holiday. Our first ever holiday together. God, I can\u2019t wait.</p><p>I\u2019ve been wanting to suggest a holiday ever since Luke and I started going out, but he works so hard, it would be like asking the prime minister to give up running the country for a bit. (Except come to think of it, he does that every summer, doesn\u2019t he? So why can\u2019t Luke?)</p><p>Luke\u2019s so busy, he hasn\u2019t even met my parents yet, which I\u2019m a bit upset about. They asked him over for Sunday lunch a few weeks ago, and Mum spent ages cooking \u2014 or at least, she bought apricot-stuffed loin of pork from Sainsbury\u2019s and a really posh chocolate meringue pudding. But at the last minute he had to cancel because there was a crisis with one of his clients in the Sunday papers. So I had to go on my own \u2014 and it was all rather miserable, to be honest. You could tell Mum was really disappointed, but she kept saying brightly, \u201cOh well, it was only a casual arrangement,\u201d which it wasn\u2019t. He sent her a huge bouquet of flowers the next day to apologize (or at least, Mel, his assistant, did), but it\u2019s not the same, is it?</p><p>The worst bit was that our next-door neighbors, Janice and Martin, popped in for a glass of sherry \u201cto meet the famous Luke,\u201d as they put it, and when they found out he wasn\u2019t there, they kept giving me all these pitying looks tinged with smugness, because their son Tom is getting married to his girlfriend Lucy next week. And I have a horrible suspicion that they think I have a crush on him. (Which I don\u2019t \u2014 in fact, quite the reverse. I actually turned him down when we were teenagers. But once people believe something like that, it\u2019s completely impossible to convince them otherwise. Hideous.)</p><p>When I got upset with Luke, he pointed out that I\u2019ve never met his parents, either. But I have once \u2014 although very briefly. And anyway it\u2019s not the same thing, because his family lives miles away, and it\u2019s all much more complicated.</p><p>To be honest, I find Luke\u2019s family setup just a tad weird. He\u2019s got a dad and a stepmum in Britain who brought him up with his two half-sisters, and whom he calls Mum and Dad. And then he\u2019s got his real mum, Elinor, who left his dad when he was little, married some rich American, and left Luke behind. Then she left the rich American and married another, even richer American and then... was there another one? Anyway, the point is, she lives in New York. So of course I haven\u2019t met her. And the rest of his family is in Devon, not exactly handy for a quick Sunday lunch.</p> <p>I said all this to Luke and I think he got my point. And at least he\u2019s making the effort to come on this little holiday. It was Mel, actually, who suggested the weekend idea. She told me Luke hadn\u2019t had a proper holiday for three years \u2014 and maybe he had to warm up to the idea. So I stopped talking about holidays and started talking about weekends away \u2014 and that did the trick! All of a sudden Luke told me to set aside this weekend. He booked the hotel himself and everything. I\u2019m so looking forward to it. We\u2019ll just do nothing but relax and take it easy \u2014 and actually spend some time with each other for a change. Lovely.</p><p>I want those clementine shoes.</p><p>Stop it.</p><p>I take another sip of coffee, lean back, and force myself to survey the bustling street. People are striding along, holding bags and chatting, and there\u2019s a girl crossing the road with nice trousers on, which I think come from Nicole Farhi and... Oh God.</p><p>A middle-aged man in a dark suit is coming along the road toward me, and I recognize him. It\u2019s Derek Smeath, my bank manager. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh, and I think he\u2019s seen me.</p><p>OK, don\u2019t panic, I instruct myself firmly. There\u2019s no need to panic. Maybe once upon a time I would have been thrown by seeing him. I might have tried to hide behind a menu, or perhaps even run away. But that\u2019s all in the past. These days, Sweetie Smeathie and I have a very honest and amicable relationship.</p><p>Still, I find myself shifting my chair slightly farther away from my LK Bennett bag, as though it hasn\u2019t got anything to do with me.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mr. Smeath!\u201d I say brightly as he approaches. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery well,\u201d says Derek Smeath, smiling. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine, thanks. Would you... would you like a coffee?\u201d I add politely, gesturing to the empty chair opposite me. And I\u2019m not really expecting him to say yes \u2014 but to my astonishment he sits down and picks up a menu.</p><p>How civilized is this? I\u2019m having coffee with my bank manager at a pavement cafe! You know, maybe I\u2019ll find a way to work this into my Morning Coffee slot. \u201cI myself prefer the informal approach to personal finance,\u201d I\u2019ll say, smiling warmly into the camera. \u201cMy own bank manager and I often share a friendly cappuccino as we discuss my current financial strategies...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs it happens, Rebecca, I\u2019ve just written a letter to you,\u201d says Derek Smeath, as a waitress puts an espresso down in front of him. Suddenly his voice is more serious, and I feel a small lurch of alarm. Oh God, what have I done now? \u201cYou and all my customers,\u201d he adds. \u201cTo tell you that I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I put my coffee cup down with a little crash. \u201cWhat do you mean, leaving?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving Endwich Bank. I\u2019ve decided to take early retirement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, appalled. Derek Smeath can\u2019t leave Endwich Bank. He can\u2019t just leave me in the lurch, just as everything was going so well. I mean, I know we haven\u2019t always exactly seen eye to eye \u2014 but recently we\u2019ve developed a really good rapport. He understands me. He understands my overdraft. What am I going to do without him?</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you too young to retire?\u201d I say, aware of the dismay in my voice. \u201cWon\u2019t you get bored?\u201d</p><p>He leans back in his chair and takes a sip of espresso. \u201cI\u2019m not planning to give up work altogether. But I think there\u2019s a little more to life than looking after people\u2019s bank accounts, don\u2019t you? Fascinating though some of them have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... yes. Yes, of course. And I\u2019m glad for you, honestly.\u201d I shrug, a little embarrassed. \u201cBut I\u2019ll... miss you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBelieve it or not,\u201d he says, smiling slightly, \u201cI think I\u2019ll miss you too, Rebecca. Yours has certainly been one of the most... interesting accounts I\u2019ve dealt with.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a penetrating look and I feel myself flush slightly. Why does he have to remind me of the past? The point is, that\u2019s all over. I\u2019m a different person now. Surely one should be allowed to turn over a new leaf and start again in life.</p><p>\u201cYour new career in television seems to be going well,\u201d he says, taking a sip of espresso.</p><p>\u201cI know! It\u2019s so great, isn\u2019t it? And it pays really well,\u201d I add, a little pointedly.</p><p>\u201cYour income has certainly gone up in recent months.\u201d He puts down his coffee cup and my heart sinks slightly. \u201cHowever...\u201d</p><p>I knew it. Why does there always have to be a however?</p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d repeats Derek Smeath. \u201cYour outgoings have also risen. Substantially. In fact, your overdraft is now higher than it was at the height of your... shall we say, your excesses.\u201d</p><p>Excesses? That is so mean.</p> <p>\u201cYou really must make more effort to keep within your overdraft limit,\u201d he\u2019s saying now. \u201cOr, even better, pay it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say vaguely. \u201cI\u2019m planning to.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve just spotted a girl on the other side of the road, with an LK Bennett bag. She\u2019s holding a great big bag \u2014 with two shoe boxes in it.</p><p>If she\u2019s allowed to buy two pairs of shoes, then why aren\u2019t I? What\u2019s the rule that says you can only buy one pair of shoes at a time? I mean, it\u2019s so arbitrary.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your other finances?\u201d Derek Smeath is asking. \u201cDo you have any store card bills, for example?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say with a tinge of smugness. \u201cI paid them all off months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t spent anything since?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly bits and pieces. Hardly anything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And what\u2019s ninety quid, really? In the greater scheme of things?</p><p>\u201cThe reason I\u2019m asking these questions,\u201d says Derek Smeath, \u201cis that I feel I should warn you. The bank is restructuring somewhat, and my successor, John Gavin, may not have quite the same relaxed approach which I have taken toward your account. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re aware quite how lenient I have been with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say, not really listening.</p><p>I mean, suppose I took up smoking. I\u2019d easily spend ninety quid on cigarettes without even thinking about it, wouldn\u2019t I?</p> <p>In fact, think of all the money I\u2019ve saved by not smoking. Easily enough to afford one little pair of shoes.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a very capable man,\u201d Derek Smeath is saying. \u201cBut also very... rigorous. Not particularly known for his flexibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, nodding absently.</p><p>\u201cI would certainly recommend that you address your overdraft without delay.\u201d He takes a sip of coffee. \u201cAnd tell me, have you done anything about taking out a pension?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm... I went to visit that independent adviser you recommended.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd did you fill in any of the forms?\u201d</p><p>Unwillingly, I drag my attention back to him.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m just considering my options,\u201d I say, and put on my wise, financial-expert look. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than rushing into the wrong investment, you know. Particularly when it comes to something as important as a pension.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery true,\u201d says Derek Smeath. \u201cBut don\u2019t spend too long considering, will you? Your money won\u2019t save itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d I say and take a sip of cappuccino.</p><p>Now I feel a bit uncomfortable. Maybe he\u2019s right. Maybe I should put \u00a390 into a pension fund instead of buying another pair of shoes.</p> <p>But on the other hand \u2014 what good is a pension fund of \u00a390? I mean, that\u2019s not exactly going to keep me in my old age, is it? Ninety measly quid. And by the time I\u2019m old, the world will probably have blown up, or something.</p><p>Whereas a pair of shoes is tangible, it\u2019s there in your hand...</p><p>Oh, sod it. I\u2019m going to get them.</p><p>\u201cMr. Smeath, I have to go,\u201d I say abruptly, putting down my cup. \u201cThere\u2019s something I have to... do.\u201d</p><p>I have to get back there as quickly as possible. I pick up my carrier bag and drop a fiver on the table. \u201cLovely to see you. And good luck in your retirement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest of luck to you too, Rebecca,\u201d says Derek Smeath, smiling kindly at me. \u201cBut do remember what I\u2019ve said. John Gavin won\u2019t indulge you in the way that I have. So please be careful with your spending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will!\u201d I say brightly.</p><p>And without quite running, I\u2019m off down the street, as quick as I can, back to LK Bennett.</p> <p>Perhaps strictly speaking I didn\u2019t exactly need to buy a pair of clementine shoes. But what occurred to me while I was trying them on was, I haven\u2019t actually broken my new rule. Because the point is, I will need them.</p><p>After all, I will need new shoes at some point, won\u2019t I? Everyone needs shoes. And surely it\u2019s far more prudent to stock up now in a style I really like, than to wait until my last pair wears out and then find nothing nice in the shops. It\u2019s only sensible. It\u2019s like... hedging my future position in the shoe market.</p><p>As I come out of LK Bennett, gleefully grasping my two shiny new bags, there\u2019s a warm, happy glow all around me, and I\u2019m not in the mood to go home. So I decide to pop across the street to Gifts and Goodies. This is one of the shops that carries Suze\u2019s frames, and I have a little habit of going in whenever I pass, just to see if anyone\u2019s buying one.</p><p>I push the door open with a little ping, and smile at the assistant, who looks up. This is such a lovely shop. It\u2019s all warm and scented, and full of gorgeous things like chrome wine racks and etched glass coasters. I sidle past a shelf of pale mauve leather notebooks, and look up \u2014 and there they are! Three purple tweed photo frames, made by Suze! I still get a thrill, every time I see them.</p><p>And oh my God! I feel a sudden zing of excitement. There\u2019s a customer standing there, and she\u2019s holding one. She\u2019s actually holding one!</p><p>To be perfectly honest, I\u2019ve never actually seen anyone buying one of Suze\u2019s frames. I mean, I know people must buy them, because they keep selling out \u2014 but I\u2019ve never actually seen it happen. This is so exciting!</p><p>I walk quietly forward just as the customer turns the frame over. She frowns at the price, and my heart gives a little flurry.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a really beautiful photo frame,\u201d I say casually. \u201cReally unusual.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says, and puts it back down on the shelf.</p><p>No! I think in dismay. Pick it up again!</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so difficult to find a nice frame these days,\u201d I say conversationally. \u201cDon\u2019t you think? When you find one, you should just... buy it! Before someone else gets it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose so,\u201d says the customer, giving me an odd look.</p> <p>Now she\u2019s walking away. What can I do?</p><p>\u201cWell, I think I\u2019ll get one,\u201d I say distinctly, and pick it up. \u201cIt\u2019ll make a perfect present. For a man, or a woman... I mean, everyone needs photograph frames, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>The customer doesn\u2019t seem to be taking any notice. But never mind, when she sees me buying it, maybe she\u2019ll rethink.</p><p>I hurry to the checkout, and the woman behind the till smiles at me. I think she\u2019s the shop owner, because I\u2019ve seen her interviewing staff and talking to suppliers. (Not that I come in here very often, it\u2019s just coincidence or something.)</p><p>\u201cHello again,\u201d she says. \u201cYou really like those frames, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say loudly. \u201cAnd such fantastic value!\u201d But the customer\u2019s looking at a glass decanter, and not even listening.</p><p>\u201cHow many of them have you bought, now? It must be about... twenty?\u201d</p><p>What? My attention snaps back to the shop owner. What\u2019s she saying?</p><p>\u201cOr even thirty?\u201d</p><p>I stare at her in shock. Has she been monitoring me, every time I\u2019ve been in here? Isn\u2019t that against the law?</p><p>\u201cQuite a collection!\u201d she adds pleasantly, as she wraps it up in tissue paper.</p> <p>I\u2019ve got to say something, or she\u2019ll get the idea that it\u2019s me buying all Suze\u2019s frames instead of the general public. Which is ridiculous. I ask you, thirty! I\u2019ve only bought about... four. Five, maybe.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t got that many!\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cI should think you\u2019ve been mixing me up with... other people. And I didn\u2019t just come in to buy a frame!\u201d I laugh gaily to show what a ludicrous idea that is. \u201cI actually wanted some of... these, too.\u201d I grab randomly at some big carved wooden letters in a nearby basket, and hand them to her. She smiles, and starts laying them out on tissue paper one by one.</p><p>\u201cP... T... R... R.\u201d</p><p>She stops, and looks at the letters puzzledly. \u201cWere you trying to make Peter?\u201d</p><p>Oh for God\u2019s sake. Does there always have to be a reason to buy things?</p><p>\u201cErm... yes,\u201d I say. \u201cFor my... my godson. He\u2019s three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely! Here we are then. Two E\u2019s, and take away one R...\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s looking at me kindly, as if I\u2019m a complete halfwit. Which I suppose is fair enough, since I can\u2019t spell Peter and it\u2019s the name of my own godson.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be... \u00a348,\u201d she says, as I reach for my purse. \u201cYou know, if you spend \u00a350, you get a free scented candle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I look up with interest. I could do with a nice scented candle. And for the sake of \u00a32...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I could find something...\u201d I say, looking vaguely round the shop.</p><p>\u201cSpell out the rest of your godson\u2019s name in wooden letters!\u201d suggests the shop owner helpfully. \u201cWhat\u2019s his surname?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, Wilson,\u201d I say without thinking.</p><p>\u201cWilson!\u201d And to my horror, she begins to root around in the basket. \u201cW... L... here\u2019s an O...\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d I say quickly, \u201cactually, better not. Because... because... actually, his parents are divorcing and he might be changing his surname.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d says the shop owner, and pulls a sympathetic face as she drops the letters back in. \u201cHow awful. Is it an acrimonious split, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, looking around the shop for something else to buy. \u201cVery. His... his mother ran off with the gardener.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d The shop owner\u2019s staring at me, and I suddenly notice a couple nearby listening as well. \u201cShe ran off with the gardener?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was... very hunky,\u201d I improvise, picking up a jewelry box and seeing that it costs \u00a375. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t keep her hands off him. The husband found them together in the toolshed. Anyway\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness me!\u201d says the shop owner. \u201cThat sounds incredible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s completely true,\u201d chimes in a voice from across the shop.</p><p>What?</p><p>My head whips round \u2014 and the woman who was looking at Suze\u2019s frames is walking toward me. \u201cI assume you\u2019re talking about Jane and Tim?\u201d she says. \u201cSuch a terrible scandal, wasn\u2019t it?

I think I\u2019d better go home.</p><p>As I reach the corner of our road, I pause and do a little rearranging of my bags. Which is to say, I put them all in one LK Bennett carrier, and push them down until you can\u2019t see them.

But I know I look guilty. I\u2019m even walking guiltily.</p><p>\u201cBex,\u201d she says suddenly. \u201cWhat else is in that bag? That\u2019s not just one pair of shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBag?\u201d I turn as though in surprise. \u201cOh, this bag. Erm... just a few... bits and pieces. You know... odds and ends...\u201d</p><p>I tail away guiltily as Suze folds her arms, looking as stern as she can.</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, listen,\u201d I say in a rush. \u201cI know I said only one pair. But before you get angry, just look.\u201d I reach into my second LK Bennett bag, slip open the box, and slowly pull out one of the clementine sandals. \u201cJust... look at that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d breathes Suze, staring at it. \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely... stunning.\u201d She takes it from me and strokes the soft leather gently \u2014 then suddenly her stern expression returns. \u201cBut did you need them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say defensively. \u201cOr at least... I was just stocking up for the future. You know, like a kind of... investment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn investment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And in a way, it\u2019s saving money \u2014 because now I\u2019ve got these, I won\u2019t need to spend any money on shoes next year. None!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d says Suze suspiciously. \u201cNone at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely! Honestly, Suze, I\u2019m going to live in these shoes. I won\u2019t need to buy any more for at least a year. Probably two!\u201d</p><p>Suze is silent and I bite my lip, waiting for her to tell me to take them back to the shop. But she\u2019s looking down at the sandal again, and touching the little clementine.</p><p>\u201cPut them on,\u201d she says suddenly. \u201cLet me see!\u201d</p><p>With a small thrill I pull out the other sandal and slip them on \u2014 and they\u2019re just perfect. My perfect clementine slippers, just like Cinderella.</p><p>\u201cOh, Bex,\u201d says Suze \u2014 and she doesn\u2019t have to say anything else. It\u2019s all there in her eyes.</p><p>Honestly, sometimes I wish I could marry Suze.</p><p>After I\u2019ve paraded back and forth a few times, Suze gives a contented sigh, then reaches inside the big carrier for the Gifts and Goodies bag. \u201cSo \u2014 what did you get from here?\u201d she says interestedly. The wooden letters spill out, and she begins to arrange them on the carpet.</p><p>\u201cP-E-T-E-R. You got a present for Peter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm... yes,\u201d I say vaguely, grabbing for the Gifts and Goodies bag before she can spot her own frame in there. (She once caught me buying one in Fancy Free and got all cross, and said she would always make me one if I wanted it.) \u201cWho\u2019s Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy machinist!\u201d says Suze. \u201cBut you\u2019ve never met him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... you know.

I always get a little thrill when Luke rings, because, to be honest, he doesn\u2019t do it that much.

Just... prune away a few things.\u201d She goes to answer the door and I\u2019m left staring at my jumbled bed.</p><p>Prune away? But prune away what, exactly? I mean, it\u2019s not as though I\u2019ve packed a load of stuff I don\u2019t need. If I just start removing things at random my whole system will collapse.</p><p>Come on. Think laterally.

I glance down at the sheet in front of me, then smile sympathetically at the camera. \u201cSo, to recap, Judy, you and your husband Bill have inherited some money. You\u2019d like to invest some of it in the stock market \u2014 but he\u2019s refusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like talking to a brick wall!\u201d comes Judy\u2019s indignant voice. \u201cHe says I\u2019ll lose it all, and it\u2019s his money too, and if all I want to do is gamble it away, then I can go to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d interrupts Emma smoothly. \u201cWell. This does sound quite a problem, Becky. Two partners disagreeing about what to do with their money.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just don\u2019t understand him!\u201d exclaims Judy. \u201cThis is our one chance to make a serious investment! It\u2019s a fantastic opportunity! Why can\u2019t he see that?\u201d</p><p>She breaks off \u2014 and there\u2019s an expectant silence around the studio. Everyone\u2019s waiting for my answer.</p><p>\u201cJudy...\u201d I pause thoughtfully. \u201cMay I ask a question? What outfit is Bill wearing today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA suit,\u201d says Judy, sounding taken aback. \u201cA gray suit for work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of tie? Plain or patterned?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlain,\u201d says Judy at once. \u201cAll his ties are plain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould he ever wear, say... a polka-dot tie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d I raise my eyebrows. \u201cJudy, would it be fair to say Bill is generally quite an unadventurous person? That he doesn\u2019t like taking risks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... yes,\u201d says Judy. \u201cNow that you say it, I suppose he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d says Rory suddenly, on the other side of the sofa. Rory is the other presenter of Morning Coffee. He\u2019s very chiseled-looking and is great at flirting with film stars, but he\u2019s not exactly the Brain of Britain. \u201cI think I see where you\u2019re going here, Becky.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, thanks Rory,\u201d says Emma, rolling her eyes at me. \u201cI think we all do. So Becky, if Bill doesn\u2019t like risk \u2014 are you saying he\u2019s right to avoid the stock market?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I reply. \u201cActually, I\u2019m not saying that at all. Because maybe what Bill isn\u2019t quite seeing is that there\u2019s more than one kind of risk. If you invest in the stock market, yes, you risk losing some money in the short term. But if you simply tuck it away in the bank for years and years, an even greater risk is that this inheritance will be eroded over time by inflation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha,\u201d puts in Rory wisely. \u201cInflation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn twenty years\u2019 time, it could well be worth very little \u2014 compared to what it would probably have achieved on the market. So if Bill is only in his thirties and wants to make a long-term investment \u2014 although it seems risky, it\u2019s in many ways safer to choose a balanced stock market portfolio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see!\u201d says Emma, and gives me an admiring look. \u201cI would never have looked at it like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuccessful investment is often simply a question of thinking laterally,\u201d I say, smiling modestly.</p><p>I love it when I get the answer right and everyone looks impressed.</p><p>\u201cDoes that help you, Judy?\u201d says Emma.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Judy. \u201cYes, it does! I\u2019ve videotaped this call, so I\u2019ll show it to Bill tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right!\u201d I say. \u201cWell, check what kind of tie he\u2019s wearing first.\u201d</p><p>Everyone laughs, and I join in after a pause \u2014 though I wasn\u2019t actually joking.</p><p>\u201cTime for one more quick call,\u201d says Emma. \u201cAnd we have Enid from Northampton, who wants to know if she\u2019s got enough money to retire on. Enid, is that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right,\u201d comes Enid\u2019s voice down the line. \u201cMy husband Tony\u2019s recently retired, and I was on holiday last week \u2014 just at home with him, cooking and so forth. And he... we got to thinking... how about I retire early, too? But I wasn\u2019t sure I had enough saved up, so I thought I\u2019d call in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of financial provision have you made for retirement, Enid?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve a pension which I\u2019ve contributed to all my life,\u201d says Enid hesitantly, \u201cand I\u2019ve a couple of savings plans... and I\u2019ve a recent inheritance which should see off the mortgage...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell!\u201d says Emma brightly. \u201cEven I can see that you\u2019re pretty well set up, Enid.

OK?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Enid after a pause. \u201cYes, I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to go to weather now,\u201d says Rory, who always perks up as the finance slot comes to an end. \u201cBut a final word, Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame as always,\u201d I say, smiling at the camera. \u201cLook after your money...\u201d</p><p>\u201c... and your money will look after you!\u201d chime in Rory and Emma. After a frozen pause, everyone relaxes and Zelda, the assistant producer, strides onto the set.</p><p>\u201cWell done!\u201d she says. \u201cGreat stuff. Now, Becky, we\u2019ve still got Enid on line four. But we can get rid of her if you like...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say. \u201cI really want to talk to her. You know, I reckon she doesn\u2019t want to retire at all!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d says Zelda, ticking something on her clipboard. \u201cOh, and Luke\u2019s waiting for you at reception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d I look at my watch. \u201cOh God... OK \u2014 can you tell him I won\u2019t be long?\u201d</p><p>I honestly don\u2019t intend to spend that long on the phone. But once I get talking to Enid, it all comes out \u2014 about how she\u2019s dreading retirement, and how her husband just wants her at home to cook for him. How she really loves her job and she was thinking about taking a computer course but her husband says it\u2019s a waste of money... By the end I\u2019m completely outraged. I\u2019ve said exactly what I think, several times over, and am in the middle of asking Enid if she considers herself a feminist, when Zelda taps me on the shoulder and suddenly I remember where I am.</p><p>It takes me about another five minutes to apologize to Enid and say I\u2019ve got to go, then for her to apologize to me \u2014 and for us both to say good-bye and thank you and don\u2019t mention it, about twenty times. Then, as quickly as possible, I head to my dressing room and change out of my Morning Coffee outfit into my driving outfit.</p><p>I\u2019m quite pleased with my appearance as I look at myself in the mirror. I\u2019m wearing: a Pucci-esque multicolored top, frayed denim cutoffs, my new sandals, Gucci shades (Harvey Nichols sale \u2014 half price!), and my treasured pale blue Denny and George scarf.</p><p>Luke\u2019s got a real thing about my Denny and George scarf. When people ask us how we met, he always says, \u201cOur eyes met across a Denny and George scarf,\u201d which is actually kind of true. He lent me some of the money I needed to buy it, and he still maintains I never paid him back so it\u2019s partly his. (Which is so not true. I paid him back straight away.)</p><p>Anyway, I tend to wear it quite a lot when we go out together. Also when we stay in together. In fact, I\u2019ll tell you a small secret \u2014 sometimes we even...</p><p>Actually, no. You don\u2019t need to know that. Forget I mentioned it.</p> <p>As I eventually hurry into reception I glance at my watch \u2014 and oh God, I\u2019m forty minutes late. And there\u2019s Luke sitting on a squashy chair, wearing the gorgeous polo shirt I bought him in the Ralph Lauren sale. He\u2019s talking intently on his mobile phone and sipping a cup of coffee and frowning at something in the paper. But then he looks up and his dark eyes meet mine, and his whole face breaks into a smile. A true, affectionate smile, which makes him seem like a different person. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I first knew Luke, I only ever saw him businesslike and polite, or scarily angry, or \u2014 very occasionally \u2014 amused. Even after we started seeing each other, it was a long time before he really let his guard down. In fact, the first time he really, really laughed, I was so surprised, I snorted lemonade through my nose.</p><p>Even now, whenever I see his face creasing into a real smile, I feel a bit of a lift inside. Because I know he\u2019s not like that with everyone. He\u2019s smiling like that because it\u2019s me. For me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry I took so long,\u201d I say. \u201cI was just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d says Luke, closing his paper and standing up. \u201cYou were talking to Enid.\u201d He gives me a kiss and squeezes my arm. \u201cI saw the last couple of calls. Good for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou just won\u2019t believe what her husband\u2019s like!\u201d I say as we go through the swing doors and out into the car park. \u201cNo wonder she wants to keep working!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just thinks she\u2019s there to give him an easy life.\u201d I shake my head fiercely. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m never going to just... stay at home and cook your supper. Never in a million years.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a short silence, and I look up to see Luke\u2019s amused expression.</p><p>\u201cOr... you know,\u201d I add hastily. \u201cAnyone\u2019s supper.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it,\u201d says Luke mildly. \u201cI\u2019m especially glad if you\u2019re never going to cook me Moroccan couscous surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d I say, flushing slightly. \u201cAnd you promised you weren\u2019t going to talk about that anymore.\u201d</p><p>My famous Moroccan evening was quite soon after we started going out. I really wanted to show Luke that I could cook \u2014 and I\u2019d seen this program about Moroccan cooking which made it look really easy and impressive. Plus there was some gorgeous Moroccan tableware on sale in Debenhams, so it should have all been perfect.</p><p>But that soggy couscous. It was the most revolting stuff I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. Even after I tried Suze\u2019s suggestion of stir-frying it with mango chutney. And there was so much of it, all swelling up in bowls everywhere...</p><p>Anyway. Never mind. We had quite a nice pizza in the end.</p><p>We\u2019re approaching Luke\u2019s convertible in the corner of the car park, and he bleeps it open.</p> <p>\u201cYou got my message, did you?\u201d he says. \u201cAbout luggage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. Here it is.\u201d</p><p>I hand him the dinkiest little suitcase in the world, which I got from a children\u2019s gift shop in Guildford. It\u2019s white canvas with red hearts stenciled round it, and I use it as a vanity case.</p><p>\u201cIs that it?\u201d says Luke, looking astonished, and I stifle a giggle. Ha! This\u2019ll show him who can pack light.</p><p>All I\u2019ve got in this case is my makeup and shampoo \u2014 but Luke doesn\u2019t need to know that, does he?</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s it,\u201d I say, raising my eyebrows slightly. \u201cYou did say, \u2018pack light.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I did,\u201d says Luke. \u201cBut this\u2014\u201d He gestures at the case. \u201cI\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>As he opens the boot, I get into the driving seat and adjust the seat forward so I can reach the pedals. I\u2019ve always wanted to drive a convertible!</p> <p>The boot slams behind me, and Luke comes round, a quizzical look on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re driving, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart of the way, I thought,\u201d I say carelessly. \u201cJust to take the pressure off you. You know, it\u2019s very dangerous to drive for too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can drive, can you, in those shoes?\u201d He\u2019s looking down at my clementine sandals \u2014 and I have to admit, the heel is a bit high for pedaling. But I\u2019m not going to let him know that. \u201cThey\u2019re new, aren\u2019t they?\u201d he adds, looking more closely at them.</p><p>And I\u2019m about to say yes, when I remember that the last time I saw him, I had new shoes on \u2014 and the time before that, too. Which is really weird and must be one of those random cluster things.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I reply instead. \u201cActually, I\u2019ve had them for ages. Actually...\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cThey\u2019re my driving shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour driving shoes,\u201d echoes Luke skeptically.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say, and start the engine before he can say any more. God, this car is amazing! It makes a fantastic roaring sound, and a kind of screech as I move it into gear.</p><p>\u201cBecky\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d I say, and slowly move off across the car park into the street. Oh, this is such a fantastic moment. I wonder if anybody\u2019s watching me. I wonder if Emma and Rory are looking out the window. And that sound guy who thinks he\u2019s so cool with his motorbike. He hasn\u2019t got a convertible, has he? Accidentally on purpose, I lean on the horn, and as the sound echoes round the car park I see at least three people turning to look. Ha! Look at me! Ha-ha-ha... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy petal,\u201d says Luke beside me. \u201cYou\u2019re causing a traffic jam.\u201d</p><p>I glance into my rear mirror \u2014 and there are three cars creeping along behind me. Which is ridiculous, because I\u2019m not going that slowly.</p><p>\u201cTry moving it up a notch,\u201d suggests Luke. \u201cTen miles an hour, say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d I say crossly. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect me just to whiz off at a million miles an hour! There is a speed limit, you know.\u201d</p> <p>I reach the exit, smile nonchalantly at the porter at the gate, who gives me a surprised look, and pull out into the road. I signal left and take a last glance back to check if anyone I know has just come out and is watching me admiringly. Then, as a car behind me starts to beep, I carefully pull in at the pavement.</p><p>\u201cThere we are,\u201d I say. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy turn?\u201d Luke stares at me. \u201cAlready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to do my nails now,\u201d I explain. \u201cAnd anyway, I know you think I can\u2019t drive. I don\u2019t want to have you pulling faces at me all the way down to Somerset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not think you can\u2019t drive,\u201d protests Luke, half-laughing. \u201cWhen have I ever said that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to say it. I can see it coming out of your head in a thought bubble: \u2018Becky Bloomwood cannot drive.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong,\u201d retorts Luke. \u201cThe bubble actually reads: \u2018Becky Bloomwood cannot drive in her new orange shoes because the heels are too high and pointy.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He raises his eyebrows, and I feel myself flush slightly.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re my driving shoes,\u201d I mutter, shifting over to the passenger seat. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve had them for years.\u201d</p><p>As I reach into my bag for my nail file, Luke gets into the driver\u2019s seat, leans over, and gives me a kiss.</p><p>\u201cThank you for doing that stint, anyway,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll lessen my risk of fatigue on the motorway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, good!\u201d I say, starting on my nails. \u201cYou need to conserve your energy for all those long country walks we\u2019re going to go on tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence, and after a while I look up.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Luke \u2014 and he isn\u2019t smiling anymore. \u201cBecky... I was going to talk to you about tomorrow.\u201d He pauses and I stare at him, feeling my own smile fade slightly.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I say, trying not to sound anxious.</p><p>Luke exhales sharply. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing. A business opportunity has arisen which I really would like to... to take advantage of. And there are some people over from the States who I need to talk to. Urgently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, a little uncertainly. \u201cWell \u2014 that\u2019s OK. If you\u2019ve got your phone with you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot by phone.\u201d He looks straight at me. \u201cI\u2019ve scheduled a meeting for tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d I echo, and give a little laugh. \u201cBut you can\u2019t have a meeting. We\u2019ll be at the hotel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo will the people I need to talk to,\u201d says Luke. \u201cI\u2019ve invited them down.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him in shock.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve invited businesspeople down on our holiday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPurely for the meeting,\u201d says Luke. \u201cThe rest of the time it\u2019ll just be the two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how long will the meeting go on?\u201d I exclaim. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me! All day!\u201d</p><p>I just can\u2019t believe it. After waiting all this time, after getting all excited, after all my packing...</p><p>\u201cBecky, it won\u2019t be as bad as that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promised me you\u2019d take time off! You said we\u2019d have a lovely romantic time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will have a lovely romantic time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith all your business friends. With all your horrible contacts, networking away like... like maggots!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t be networking with us,\u201d says Luke with a grin. \u201cBecky\u2014\u201d He reaches for my hand, but I pull it away.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t see any point in my coming if it\u2019s just you doing business!\u201d I say miserably. \u201cI might as well just stay at home. In fact\u2014\u201d I open the car door. \u201cIn fact, I think I\u2019ll go home right now. I\u2019ll call a taxi from the studio.\u201d</p><p>I slam the car door and begin to stride off along the street, my clementine sandals making a click-clack sound against the hot pavement. And I\u2019ve almost got to the studio gate before I hear his voice, raised so loud that several people turn to look.</p><p>\u201cBecky! Wait there!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stop and slowly turn on the spot \u2014 to see him standing up in the car, dialing a number on his mobile phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I call suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m phoning my horrible business contact,\u201d says Luke. \u201cTo put him off. To cancel.\u201d</p><p>I fold my arms and stare at him with narrowed eyes.</p> <p>\u201cHello?\u201d he says. \u201cRoom 301, please. Michael Ellis. Thanks. I guess I\u2019ll just have to fly out and see him in Washington,\u201d he adds to me in deadpan tones. \u201cOr wait until the next time he and his associates are all together in Britain. Which could be a while, bearing in mind their completely crazy schedules. Still, it\u2019s only business, after all. Only a deal. It\u2019s only the deal I\u2019ve been wanting to make for...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh... stop it!\u201d I say furiously. \u201cStop it. Have your stupid meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d says Luke, putting a hand over the receiver. \u201cAbsolutely sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite sure,\u201d I say, giving a morose shrug. \u201cIf it\u2019s that important...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty important,\u201d says Luke, and meets my eyes, suddenly serious. \u201cBelieve me, I wouldn\u2019t be doing it otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>I walk slowly back to the car as Luke puts away his mobile phone.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Becky,\u201d he says as I get in. \u201cI mean it.\u201d He touches my cheek gently, then reaches for the keys and starts up the engine.</p><p>As we drive off toward a set of traffic lights, I glance at him, and then at his mobile phone, still sticking out of his pocket.</p><p>\u201cWere you really phoning your business contact?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWere you really going home?\u201d he replies, without moving his head.</p><p>This is what\u2019s so annoying about going out with Luke. You can\u2019t get away with anything.</p> <p>We drive for about an hour into the countryside, stop for lunch in a little village pub, then drive for another hour and a half down to Somerset. By the time we reach Blakeley Hall, I feel like a different person. It\u2019s so good to get out of London \u2014 and I\u2019m already incredibly energized and refreshed by all this wonderful country air. As I step out of the car I do a few stretches \u2014 and honestly, I already feel fitter and more toned. I reckon if I came to the country every week, I\u2019d lose half a stone, if not more.</p><p>\u201cDo you want any more of these?\u201d says Luke, reaching down and picking up the nearly empty packet of Maltesers which I\u2019ve been snacking on. (I have to eat in the car, otherwise I get carsick.) \u201cAnd what about these magazines?\u201d He picks up the stack of glossies which have been at my feet, then makes a grab as they all start slithering out of his hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to read magazines here!\u201d I say in surprise. \u201cThis is the country!\u201d</p><p>Honestly. Doesn\u2019t Luke know anything about rural life?</p><p>As he\u2019s getting the bags out of the boot I wander over to a fence and gaze peacefully at a field full of browny-yellow stuff. You know, I reckon I have a real natural affinity for the countryside. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve got this whole nurturing, earth-mother side, which has been gradually creeping up on me. For example, the other day I found myself buying a Fair Isle jersey from French Connection. And I\u2019ve recently started gardening! Or at least, I\u2019ve bought some sweet little ceramic flowerpots from The Pier, marked \u201cBasil\u201d and \u201cCoriander\u201d\u2014and I\u2019m definitely going to get some of those little plants from the supermarket and have a whole row of them on the windowsill. (I mean, they\u2019re only about 50 pence, so if they die you can just buy another one.)</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d says Luke.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I say, and teeter back toward him, cursing the mud.</p><p>We crunch over the gravel to the hotel \u2014 and I have to say, I\u2019m impressed. It\u2019s a great big old-fashioned country house, with beautiful gardens, and modern sculptures in the gardens and its own cinema, according to the brochure! Luke\u2019s been here quite a few times before, and he says it\u2019s his favorite hotel. And lots of celebrities come here, too! Like Madonna. (Or was it Sporty Spice? Someone, anyway.) But apparently they\u2019re always very discreet and usually stay in some separate coach-housey bit, and the staff never lets on.</p> <p>Still, as we go into the reception hall I have a good look around, just in case. There are lots of cool-looking people in trendy spectacles and denim, and there\u2019s a blonde girl who sort of looks famous-ish, and standing over there...</p><p>I freeze in excitement. It\u2019s him, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s Elton John! Elton John himself is standing right there, only a few\u2014</p><p>Then he turns round \u2014 and it\u2019s just a dumpy guy in an anorak and spectacles. Damn. Still, it was nearly Elton John. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We\u2019ve reached the reception desk by now, and a concierge in a trendy Nehru jacket smiles at us. \u201cGood afternoon, Mr. Brandon,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd Miss Bloomwood. Welcome to Blakeley Hall.\u201d</p><p>He knew our names! We didn\u2019t even have to tell him! No wonder celebrities come here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve put you in room 9,\u201d he says, as Luke starts to fill in a form. \u201cOverlooking the rose garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d says Luke. \u201cBecky, which paper would you like in the morning?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Financial Times,\u201d I say smoothly.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d says Luke, writing. \u201cSo that\u2019s one FT \u2014 and a Daily World for me.\u201d</p><p>I give him a suspicious look, but his face is completely blank.</p><p>\u201cWould you like tea in the morning?\u201d says the concierge, tapping at his computer. \u201cOr coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee, please,\u201d says Luke. \u201cFor both of us, I think.\u201d He looks at me questioningly, and I nod.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find a complimentary bottle of champagne in your room,\u201d says the concierge, \u201cand room service is available twenty-four hours.\u201d</p><p>I have to say I\u2019m very impressed. This really is a top-class place. They know your face immediately, they give you champagne \u2014 and they haven\u2019t even mentioned my Special Express parcel yet. Obviously they realize it\u2019s a matter of discretion. They realize that a girl doesn\u2019t necessarily want her boyfriend knowing about every single package that is delivered to her \u2014 and are going to wait until Luke is out of earshot until they tell me about it. This is why it\u2019s worth coming to a good hotel.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything else you require, Miss Bloomwood,\u201d says the concierge, looking at me meaningfully, \u201cplease don\u2019t hesitate to let me know.\u201d</p><p>You see? Coded messages and everything.</p><p>\u201cI will, don\u2019t worry,\u201d I say, and give him a knowing smile. \u201cIn just a moment.\u201d I flick my eyes meaningfully toward Luke, and the concierge gives me a blank stare, exactly as though he\u2019s got no idea what I\u2019m talking about. God, these people are good!</p><p>Eventually, Luke finishes the forms and hands them back. The concierge hands him a big, old-fashioned room key, and summons a porter.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we need any help,\u201d says Luke, with a smile, and lifts up my dinky suitcase. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly overburdened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go on up,\u201d I say. \u201cI just want to... check something. For tomorrow.\u201d I smile at Luke and after a moment, to my relief, he heads off toward the staircase.</p><p>As soon as he\u2019s out of earshot, I swivel back to the desk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it now,\u201d I murmur to the concierge, who has turned away and is looking in a drawer. He raises his head and looks at me in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Miss Bloomwood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d I say more meaningfully. \u201cYou can give it to me now. While Luke\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>A flicker of apprehension passes over the concierge\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can give me my package.\u201d I lower my voice. \u201cAnd thanks for not letting on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour... package?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Special Express.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat Special Express?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, feeling a few misgivings.</p><p>\u201cThe parcel with all my clothes in it! The one you weren\u2019t mentioning! The one...\u201d</p><p>I tail away at the sight of his face. He doesn\u2019t have a clue what I\u2019m talking about, does he? OK. Don\u2019t panic. Someone else will know where it is.</p><p>\u201cI should have a parcel waiting for me,\u201d I explain. \u201cAbout this big... It should have arrived this morning...\u201d</p><p>The concierge is shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Miss Bloomwood. There aren\u2019t any packages for you.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I feel a little hollow.</p><p>\u201cBut... there has to be a package. I sent it by Special Express, yesterday. To Blakeley Hall.\u201d</p><p>The concierge frowns.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte?\u201d he says, calling into a back room. \u201cHas a parcel arrived for Rebecca Bloomwood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Charlotte, coming out. \u201cWhen was it supposed to arrive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis morning!\u201d I say, trying to hide my agitation. \u201c \u2018Anything, anywhere, by tomorrow morning\u2019! I mean, this is anywhere, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d says Charlotte, \u201cbut nothing\u2019s come. Was it very important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca?\u201d comes a voice from the stairs, and I turn to see Luke peering down at me. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say brightly. \u201cOf course not! What on earth could be wrong?\u201d Quickly I swivel away from the desk and, before Charlotte or the concierge can say anything, hurry toward the stairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEverything all right?\u201d he says as I reach him, and smiles at me.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I say, my voice two notches higher than usual. \u201cEverything\u2019s absolutely fine!\u201d</p><p>I have no clothes. This cannot be happening.</p><p>I\u2019m on holiday with Luke, in a smart hotel \u2014 and I have no clothes. What am I going to do?</p> <p>I can\u2019t tell him the truth. I just can\u2019t admit that my dinky suitcase was only the tip of the clothes-berg. Not after having been so smug about it. I\u2019ll just have to... improvise, I think wildly, as we turn a corner and start walking down another plushy corridor. Wear his clothes, like Annie Hall or... or rip down the curtains and find some sewing stuff... and quickly learn how to sew...</p><p>Calm down, I tell myself firmly. Just... calm down. The parcel is bound to arrive tomorrow morning, so I\u2019ve only got to last one night. And at least I\u2019ve got my makeup with me...</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d says Luke, stopping at a door and opening it. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Oh wow. For a moment all my worries are swept away as I gaze around the enormous airy room. Now I can see why Luke likes this hotel so much. It\u2019s gorgeous \u2014 exactly like his flat, all huge white bed with an enormous waffle duvet, and a state-of-the-art music system and two suede sofas.</p><p>\u201cTake a look at the bathroom,\u201d says Luke, and I follow him through \u2014 and it\u2019s stunning. A great sunken mosaic Jacuzzi, with the hugest shower I\u2019ve ever seen above, and a whole rack of gorgeous-looking aromatherapy oils.</p> <p>Maybe I could just spend the whole weekend in the bath.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he says, turning back into the room. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019d like to do...\u201d He walks over to his suitcase and clicks it open \u2014 and I can see serried rows of shirts, all ironed by his housekeeper. \u201cI suppose we should unpack first...\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnpack! Absolutely!\u201d I say brightly. I walk over to my own little suitcase and finger the clasp, without opening it. \u201cOr else...\u201d I say, as though the idea\u2019s just occurring to me, \u201cwhy don\u2019t we go and have a drink \u2014 and unpack later!\u201d</p><p>Genius. We\u2019ll go downstairs and get really pissed, and then tomorrow morning I\u2019ll just pretend to be really sleepy and stay in bed until my package comes. Thank God. For a moment there I was starting to\u2014</p><p>\u201cExcellent idea,\u201d says Luke. \u201cI\u2019ll just get changed.\u201d And he reaches into his case and pulls out a pair of trousers and a crisp blue shirt.</p><p>\u201cChanged?\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cIs there... a strict dress code?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh no, not strict,\u201d says Luke. \u201cYou just wouldn\u2019t go down in... say, in what you\u2019re wearing at the moment.\u201d He gestures to my denim cutoffs with a grin.</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d I say, laughing as though the idea\u2019s ridiculous. \u201cRight. Well. I\u2019ll just... choose an outfit, then.\u201d</p><p>I turn to my case again, snap it open, lift the lid, and look at my makeup bag.</p><p>What am I going to do? Luke\u2019s unbuttoning his shirt. He\u2019s calmly reaching for the blue one. In a minute he\u2019s going to look up and say, \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>I need a radical plan of action here.</p><p>\u201cLuke \u2014 I\u2019ve changed my mind,\u201d I say, and close the lid of my case. \u201cLet\u2019s not go down to the bar.\u201d Luke looks up in surprise, and I give him the most seductive smile I can muster. \u201cLet\u2019s stay up here, and order room service, and...\u201d I take a few steps toward him, loosening my wrap top, \u201c... and see where the night leads us.\u201d</p><p>Luke stares at me, his hands still halfway up the buttons of his blue shirt.</p><p>\u201cTake that off,\u201d I say huskily. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of dressing up when all we want to do is undress each other?\u201d</p> <p>A slow smile spreads across Luke\u2019s face, and his eyes begin to gleam.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so right,\u201d he says, and walks toward me, unbuttoning his shirt and letting it fall to the floor. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I was thinking of.\u201d</p><p>Thank God! I think in relief, as he reaches for my wrap top and gently starts to untie it. This is perfect. This is exactly what I\u2014</p><p>Ooh. Mmm.</p><p>Actually, this is pretty bloody perfect.</p><p>Four</p><p>BY EIGHT THIRTY the next morning, I still haven\u2019t got up. I don\u2019t want to move an inch. I want to stay in this lovely comfortable bed, wrapped up in this gorgeous white waffle duvet.</p><p>\u201cAre you staying there all day?\u201d says Luke, smiling at me. \u201cNot that I don\u2019t want to join you.\u201d He kisses me on the forehead and I snuggle down in the pillows without replying. I just don\u2019t want to get up. I\u2019m so cozy and warm and happy here. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Plus \u2014 just a very small point \u2014 I still don\u2019t have any clothes.</p><p>I\u2019ve already secretly rung down to reception three times about my Special Express.

I have nil clothes. Nada.</p><p>Which hasn\u2019t mattered up until now, because I\u2019ve just been lounging around in bed.

Which is really hideous, but what else can I do? I\u2019ll just pretend I\u2019m sentimental about them, or maybe hope I can slip them on and Luke won\u2019t even realize. I mean, do men really notice what you...</p><p>Hang on.</p><p>Hang on a minute. Where are yesterday\u2019s clothes? I\u2019m sure I dropped them just there on the floor...</p><p>\u201cLuke?\u201d I say, as casually as possible. \u201cHave you seen the clothes I was wearing yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d he says, glancing up from his suitcase. \u201cI sent them to the laundry this morning, along with my stuff.\u201d</p> <p>I stare at him, unable to breathe.</p><p>My only clothes in the whole world have gone to the laundry?</p><p>\u201cWhen... when will they be back?\u201d I say at last.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow morning.\u201d Luke turns to look at me. \u201cSorry, I should have said. But it\u2019s not a problem, is it? I mean, I don\u2019t think you have to worry. They do an excellent job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no!\u201d I say in a high, brittle voice. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not worried!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he says, and smiles.</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d I say, and smile back.</p><p>What am I going to do?</p><p>\u201cOh, and there\u2019s plenty of room in the wardrobe,\u201d says Luke, \u201cif you want me to hang anything up.\u201d He reaches toward my little case and in a panic, I hear myself crying \u201cNooo!\u201d before I can stop myself. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I add, as he looks at me in surprise. \u201cMy clothes are mostly... knitwear.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Oh God. Now he\u2019s putting on his shoes. What am I going to do?</p><p>OK, come on, Becky, I think frantically. Clothes. Something to wear. Doesn\u2019t matter what.</p><p>One of Luke\u2019s suits?</p><p>No. He\u2019ll just think it\u2019s too weird, and anyway, his suits all cost about \u00a31,000 so I won\u2019t be able to roll the sleeves up.</p><p>My hotel robe? Pretend robes and waffle slippers are the latest fashion? Oh, but I can\u2019t walk around in a dressing gown as if I think I\u2019m in a spa. Everyone will laugh at me.</p> <p>Come on, there must be clothes in a hotel. What about... the chambermaids\u2019 uniforms! Yes, that\u2019s more like it! They must keep a rack of them somewhere, mustn\u2019t they? Neat little dresses with matching hats. I could tell Luke they\u2019re the latest thing from Prada \u2014 and just hope no one asks me to clear out their room...</p><p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d says Luke, reaching into his case, \u201cyou left this behind at my flat.\u201d</p><p>And as I look up, startled, he chucks something across the room at me. It\u2019s soft, it\u2019s fabric... as I catch it, I want to weep with relief. It\u2019s clothes! A single oversized Calvin Klein T-shirt, to be precise. I have never been so glad to see a plain washed-out gray T-shirt in my life.</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d I say. And I force myself to count to ten before I add casually, \u201cActually, maybe I\u2019ll wear this today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat?\u201d says Luke, giving me a strange look. \u201cI thought it was a nightshirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is! It\u2019s a nightshirt-slash-dress,\u201d I say, popping it over my head \u2014 and thank God, it comes to halfway down my thighs. It could easily be a dress. And ha! I\u2019ve got a stretchy black headband in my makeup bag, which just about fits me as a belt.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d says Luke quizzically, watching me wriggle into it. \u201cA little on the short side...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a minidress,\u201d I say firmly, and turn to look at my reflection. And... oh God, it is a bit short. But it\u2019s too late to do anything about that now. I step into my clementine sandals and shake back my hair, not allowing myself to think about all the great outfits I had planned for this morning.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d says Luke. He reaches for my Denny and George scarf and winds it slowly round my neck. \u201cDenny and George scarf, no knickers. Just the way I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to wear knickers!\u201d I say indignantly.</p><p>Which is true. I\u2019ll wait till Luke\u2019s gone, then pinch a pair of his boxer shorts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo \u2014 what\u2019s your deal about?\u201d I ask hurriedly, to change the subject. \u201cSomething exciting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... pretty big,\u201d says Luke after a pause. He holds up a pair of silk ties. \u201cWhich one will bring me luck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe red one,\u201d I say after a little consideration. \u201cIt matches your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt matches my eyes?\u201d Luke starts to laugh. \u201cDo I look that rough?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt goes with your eyes. You know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you were right first time,\u201d says Luke, peering into the mirror. \u201cIt matches my eyes perfectly.\u201d He glances at me. \u201cYou\u2019d almost think I\u2019d had no sleep last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sleep?\u201d I raise my eyebrows. \u201cBefore an important meeting? Surely that\u2019s not the way Luke Brandon behaves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery irresponsible,\u201d agrees Luke, putting the tie round his neck. \u201cMust be thinking of someone else.\u201d</p><p>I watch as he knots the tie with brisk, efficient movements. \u201cSo come on \u2014 tell me about this deal. Is it a big new client?\u201d</p> <p>But Luke smiles and shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cIs it Nat West? I know, Lloyds Bank!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say... it\u2019s something I want very much,\u201d Luke says eventually. \u201cSomething I\u2019ve always wanted. But this is all very boring,\u201d he adds in a different tone.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery dull indeed. Now \u2014 what are you going to do today? Will you be all right?\u201d And now he sounds like he\u2019s changing the subject.</p><p>Actually, I think Luke\u2019s a bit sensitive about boring me with his work. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think his business is really fascinating. But there was this one occasion when it was really late at night, and he was telling me about a new range of technical products he was going to represent and I kind of... fell asleep.</p> <p>I think he took it to heart, because recently he\u2019s hardly talked about work at all.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard the pool is closed this morning?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say, reaching for my blusher. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ll easily amuse myself.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence and I look up to see Luke surveying me doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to order you a taxi to take you to the shops? Bath is quite near here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say indignantly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go shopping!\u201d</p><p>Which is true. When Suze found out how much those clementine sandals were, she got all worried that she hadn\u2019t been strict enough with me, so I promised not to do any shopping this weekend. She made me cross my heart and swear on \u2014 well, on my clementine sandals, actually. And I\u2019m going to make a real effort to keep to it.</p><p>I mean, I should be able to last forty-eight hours.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do all lovely rural things,\u201d I say, snapping my blusher closed.</p><p>\u201cLike...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike look at the scenery... and maybe go to a farm and watch them milking the cows, or something...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say suspiciously. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just going to pitch up at a farm, are you, and ask if you can milk the cows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I was going to milk the cows,\u201d I say with dignity. \u201cI said I was going to watch the cows. And anyway, I might not go to a farm, I might go and look at some local attractions.\u201d I reach for a pile of leaflets on the dressing table. \u201cLike... this tractor exhibition. Or... St. Winifred\u2019s Convent with its famous Bevington Triptych.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA convent,\u201d echoes Luke after a pause.</p><p>\u201cYes, a convent!\u201d I give him an indignant look. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I visit a convent? I\u2019m actually a very spiritual person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are, my darling,\u201d says Luke, giving me a quizzical look. \u201cYou might want to put on more than a T-shirt before you go...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a dress!\u201d I say indignantly, pulling the T-shirt down over my bum. \u201cAnd anyway, spirituality has nothing to do with clothes. \u2018Consider the lilies of the field.\u2019 \u201d I shoot him a satisfied glance.</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d Luke grins. \u201cWell, enjoy yourself.\u201d He gives me a kiss. \u201cAnd Becky, I really am sorry about all this. This wasn\u2019t the way I wanted our first weekend away to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well,\u201d I say, and give him a little poke in the chest. \u201cYou just make sure this mysterious deal is worth it.\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m expecting Luke to laugh, or at least smile \u2014 but he just gives me a tiny nod, picks up his briefcase, and heads for the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t actually mind having this morning to myself, because I\u2019ve always secretly wanted to see what it\u2019s like inside a convent. I mean, I know I don\u2019t exactly make it to church every week, but I do have a very spiritual side to me. It seems obvious to me that there\u2019s a greater force out there at work than us mere mortals \u2014 which is why I always read my horoscope in The Daily World. Plus I love that plainchant they play in yoga classes, and all the lovely candles and incense. And Audrey Hepburn in The Nun\u2019s Story.</p><p>In fact, to tell you the truth, a part of me has always been attracted to the simplicity of a nun\u2019s life. No worries, no decisions, no having to work. Just lovely singing and walking around all day. I mean, wouldn\u2019t that be great?</p><p>So when I\u2019ve done my makeup and watched a bit of telly, I go down to reception \u2014 and after asking fruitlessly again about my package (honestly, I\u2019m going to sue), I order a taxi to St. Winifred\u2019s. As we trundle along the country lanes, I look out at all the lovely scenery, and find myself wondering what Luke\u2019s deal can be about. What on earth is this mysterious \u201csomething he\u2019s always wanted\u201d? I mean, I would have thought he\u2019s already got everything he wants. He\u2019s the most successful publicist in the financial field, he\u2019s got a thriving company, he\u2019s won loads of prizes... So what could it be? Big new client? New offices? Expanding the company, maybe?</p><p>I screw up my face, trying to remember if I\u2019ve overheard anything recently \u2014 then, with a jolt, I remember hearing him on the phone a few weeks ago. He was talking about an advertising agency, and even at the time, I wondered why.</p> <p>Yes. It\u2019s obvious, now that I think about it. He\u2019s always secretly wanted to be an ad director. That\u2019s what this deal is all about. He\u2019s going to branch out from PR and start making adverts.</p><p>And I could be in them! Yes!</p><p>I\u2019m so excited at this thought, I almost swallow my chewing gum. I can be in an ad! Oh, this is going to be so cool. Maybe I\u2019ll be in one of those Bacardi ads where they\u2019re all on a boat, laughing and water-skiing and having a great time. I mean, I know it\u2019s usually fashion models, but I could easily be somewhere in the background. Or I could be the one driving the boat. It\u2019ll be so fantastic. We\u2019ll fly out to Barbados or somewhere, and it\u2019ll be all hot and sunny and glamorous, with loads of free Bacardi, and we\u2019ll stay in a really amazing hotel... I\u2019ll have to buy a new bikini, of course... or maybe two... and some new flip-flops...</p><p>\u201cSt. Winifred\u2019s,\u201d says the taxi driver \u2014 and with a start I come to. I\u2019m not in Barbados, am I? I\u2019m in the middle of bloody nowhere, in Somerset.</p><p>We\u2019ve stopped outside an old honey-colored building, and I peer through the window curiously. So this is a convent. It doesn\u2019t look that special, actually \u2014 just like a school, or a big country house. And I\u2019m wondering whether I should even bother getting out, when I see a nun. Walking past, in black robes, and a wimple, and everything! A real live nun, in her real habitat. And she\u2019s completely natural. She hasn\u2019t even looked at the taxi. This is like being on safari!</p> <p>I get out and pay the driver \u2014 and as I walk toward the heavy front door, I feel prickles of intrigue. There\u2019s an elderly woman going in at the same time who seems to know the way, so I follow her along a corridor toward the chapel. And as we walk in, I feel this amazing, holy, almost euphoric sensation coming over me. Maybe it\u2019s the lovely smell in the air or the organ music, but I\u2019m definitely getting something.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sister,\u201d says the elderly woman to the nun. And she starts walking off to the front of the chapel \u2014 but I stand still, slightly transfixed.</p><p>Sister. Wow.</p><p>Sister Rebecca.</p><p>And one of those lovely flowing black habits, and a fantastic clear nun complexion all the time.</p><p>Sister Rebecca of the Holy...</p> <p>\u201cYou look a little lost, my dear,\u201d a nun says behind me, and I jump. \u201cWere you interested in seeing the Bevington Triptych?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say. \u201cErm... yes. Absolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp there,\u201d she points, and I walk tentatively toward the front of the chapel, hoping it will become obvious what the Bevington Triptych is. A statue, maybe? Or a... a piece of tapestry?</p><p>But as I reach the elderly lady, I see that she\u2019s staring up at a whole wall of stained-glass windows. And I have to admit, they\u2019re pretty amazing. I mean, look at that huge blue one in the middle. It\u2019s fantastic!</p><p>\u201cThe Bevington Triptych,\u201d says the elderly woman. \u201cIt simply has no parallel, does it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWow,\u201d I breathe reverentially, staring up with her. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>And it really is stunning. It just shows, there\u2019s no mistaking a real work of art, is there? Real genius just leaps out at you. And I\u2019m not even an expert.</p><p>\u201cWonderful colors,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>\u201cThe detail,\u201d says the woman, clasping her hands, \u201cis absolutely incomparable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIncomparable,\u201d I echo.</p><p>And I\u2019m just about to point out the rainbow, which I think is a really nice touch \u2014 when I suddenly notice that the elderly woman and I aren\u2019t looking at the same window. She\u2019s looking at a much smaller, dingier one which I hadn\u2019t even noticed.</p><p>As inconspicuously as possible, I shift my gaze to the right one \u2014 and feel a pang of disappointment. Is this the Bevington Triptych? But it isn\u2019t even pretty!</p><p>\u201cWhereas this Victorian rubbish,\u201d the woman suddenly adds savagely, \u201cis absolutely criminal! That rainbow! Doesn\u2019t it make you feel sick?\u201d She gestures to my big blue window, and I gulp.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking, isn\u2019t it? Absolutely... You know, I think I\u2019ll just go for a little wander...\u201d</p> <p>Hastily I back away, before she can say any more. And I\u2019m sidling back down the side of the pews, wondering vaguely what to do next, when suddenly I notice a little side chapel in the corner.</p><p>Spiritual retreat, reads a notice outside. A place to sit quietly, pray, and discover more about the Catholic faith.</p><p>Cautiously I poke my head inside the side chapel \u2014 and there\u2019s an old nun, sitting on a chair, doing embroidery. She smiles at me, and nervously I smile back and walk inside.</p><p>I sit down on a dark wooden pew, trying not to make any creaking sounds, and for a while I\u2019m too awestruck to say anything. This is just amazing. The atmosphere is fantastic, all quiet and still \u2014 and I feel incredibly cleansed and holy just from being here. I smile again at the nun, shyly, and she puts down her embroidery and looks at me as though waiting for me to speak.</p><p>\u201cI really like your candles,\u201d I say in a quiet, reverent voice. \u201cAre they from Habitat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says the nun, looking a bit startled. \u201cI don\u2019t believe so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh right.\u201d</p><p>I give a tiny yawn \u2014 because I\u2019m still sleepy from all this country air \u2014 and as I do so, I notice that one of my nails has chipped. So very quietly, I unzip my bag, get out my nail file, and start to buff it. The nun looks up, and I give her a rueful smile, and point to my nail (silently, because I don\u2019t want to ruin the spiritual atmosphere). Then, when I\u2019ve finished, the edge is looking a bit ragged, so I take out my Maybelline express dry polish and very quickly touch it up.</p><p>All the while, the nun is watching me with a perplexed expression, and as I\u2019m finishing, she says, \u201cMy dear, are you a Catholic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not, actually,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWas there anything you wanted to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm... not really.\u201d I run my hand fondly over the pew I\u2019m sitting on, and give her a friendly smile. \u201cThis carving is really nice, isn\u2019t it. Is all your furniture as nice as this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the chapel,\u201d says the nun, giving me a strange look.</p><p>\u201cOh, I know! But you know, loads of people have pews in their houses, too, these days. I saw this article in Harpers\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy child...\u201d The nun lifts a hand to interrupt me. \u201cMy child, this is a place of spiritual retreat. Of quietness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d I say in surprise. \u201cThat\u2019s why I came in. For quietness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d says the nun, and we lapse into silence again.</p><p>In the distance, a bell starts tolling, and I notice the nun begins murmuring very quietly under her breath. I wonder what she\u2019s saying? My granny used to knit things, and mutter the pattern to herself. Maybe she\u2019s lost track of her embroidery.</p><p>\u201cYour sewing\u2019s going really well,\u201d I say encouragingly. \u201cWhat\u2019s it going to be?\u201d She gives a tiny start, and puts down her embroidery.</p><p>\u201cMy dear,\u201d she says, and exhales sharply. Then she gives me a warm smile. \u201cMy dear, we have some quite famous lavender fields. Would you like to go and see them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s all right.\u201d I beam at her. \u201cI\u2019m just happy, sitting here with you.\u201d</p><p>The nun\u2019s smile wavers slightly. \u201cWhat about the crypt?\u201d she says. \u201cWould you be interested in that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly. But honestly, I\u2019m not bored! It\u2019s just so lovely here. So... tranquil. Just like The Sound of Music.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stares at me as though I\u2019m speaking gibberish, and I realize she\u2019s probably been in the convent so long, she doesn\u2019t know what The Sound of Music is.</p><p>\u201cThere was this film...\u201d I start to explain. Then it occurs to me, maybe she doesn\u2019t know what a film is, even. \u201cIt\u2019s like, moving pictures,\u201d I say carefully. \u201cYou watch it on a screen. And there was this nun called Maria...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a shop,\u201d interrupts the nun urgently. \u201cA shop. What about that?\u201d</p><p>A shop! For a moment I feel all excited, and want to ask what they sell. But then I remember the promise I made to Suze.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I say regretfully. \u201cI told my flatmate I wouldn\u2019t go shopping today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour flatmate?\u201d says the nun. \u201cWhat does she have to do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just gets really worried about me spending money\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes your flatmate run your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s just I made her this quite serious promise a while ago. You know, a bit like a vow, I suppose...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019ll never know!\u201d says the nun. \u201cNot if you don\u2019t tell her.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, a bit taken aback.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019d feel really bad, breaking my promise! No, I\u2019ll just stay here with you for a bit longer, if that\u2019s OK.\u201d I pick up a little statue of Mary which has caught my eye. \u201cThis is nice. Where did you get it?\u201d</p><p>The nun stares at me, her eyes narrowing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think of it as shopping,\u201d she says at last. \u201cThink of it as making a donation.\u201d She leans forward. \u201cYou donate the money \u2014 and we give you a little something in return. You couldn\u2019t really count it as shopping at all. More... an act of charity.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m silent for a few moments, letting this idea sink in. The truth is, I do always mean to do more for charity, and maybe this is my chance.</p> <p>\u201cSo, it\u2019ll be like doing a good deed?\u201d I say, just to be sure.</p><p>\u201cExactly the same. And Jesus and all his angels will bless you for it.\u201d She takes hold of my arm. \u201cNow, you go along and have a browse. Come on, I\u2019ll show you the way...\u201d</p><p>As we leave the side chapel, the nun shuts the door and takes down the Spiritual Retreat notice.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you coming back?\u201d I say in surprise.</p><p>\u201cNot today, no,\u201d she says, and gives me an odd look. \u201cI think I\u2019ll leave it for today.\u201d</p><p>You know, it\u2019s just like they say \u2014 virtue is its own reward. As I arrive back at the hotel later that afternoon, I\u2019m glowing with happiness at all the good I\u2019ve done. I must have donated at least \u00a350 in that shop, if not more! In fact, not to show off or anything, but I\u2019m obviously naturally very altruistic. Because once I started donating, I couldn\u2019t stop! Each time I parted with a bit more money, I felt a real high. And although it\u2019s a completely incidental point, I ended up with some really nice stuff in return. Lots of lavender honey, and lavender essential oil, and some lavender tea, which I\u2019m sure will be delicious, and a lavender pillow to help me sleep.</p><p>The amazing thing is, I\u2019d never really given lavender much thought before. I just thought of it as a plant in people\u2019s gardens. But that young nun behind the table was quite right \u2014 it has such vital, life-enhancing properties that it should be part of everyone\u2019s life. Plus St. Winifred\u2019s lavender is completely organic, she explained, so it\u2019s vastly superior to other varieties, but the prices are much lower than many competing mail-order catalogues. She was the one who persuaded me to buy the lavender pillow, actually, and to put my name on the mailing list. She was really quite persistent, for a nun.</p><p>When I get back to Blakeley Hall, the minicab driver offers to help me lug it all in, because the box of lavender honey is quite heavy. And I\u2019m standing at the reception desk, giving him a nice hefty tip and thinking I might go and have a nice bath with my new lavender bath essence... when the front door into reception swings open. Into the hotel strides a girl with blond hair, a Louis Vuitton bag, and long tanned legs.</p> <p>I stare at her in disbelief. It\u2019s Alicia Billington. Or, as I call her, Alicia Bitch Longlegs. What\u2019s she doing here?</p><p>Alicia is one of the account executives in Brandon Communications \u2014 which is Luke\u2019s PR company \u2014 and we\u2019ve never exactly got along. In fact, between you and me, she\u2019s a bit of a cow and, secretly, I wish Luke would fire her. A few months ago, actually, she nearly did get fired \u2014 and it was kind of to do with me. (I was a financial journalist then, and I wrote this piece... oh, it\u2019s a bit of a long story.) But in the end she just got a stiff warning, and since then, she\u2019s really pulled her socks up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I know all this because I have little chats every now and then with Luke\u2019s assistant, Mel, who\u2019s a real sweetie and keeps me up on all the gossip. She was telling me only the other day that she reckons Alicia\u2019s really changed. She isn\u2019t any nicer, but she certainly works harder. She badgers journalists until they put her clients into their stories, and often stays really late at the office, tapping at her computer. And only the other day she told Mel she wanted a full list of all the company\u2019s clients, with contact names, so she could familiarize herself with them. Plus she wrote some company strategy report which Luke was really impressed by. Mel added gloomily that she reckons Alicia wants a promotion \u2014 and I think she could be right.</p><p>The trouble with Luke is, he only looks at how hard a person works and what results they get \u2014 and not at what a completely horrible cow they are. In fact, just the other day I heard him telling someone how reliable Alicia was in stressful situations and how he\u2019s really starting to depend on her. So the chances are, she probably will get a promotion \u2014 and become even more unbearable.</p><p>As I watch her come in, I\u2019m slightly transfixed. Half of me wants to run away and half of me wants to know what she\u2019s doing here. But before I can decide, she spots me, and raises her eyebrows slightly. And oh God, suddenly I realize what I must look like \u2014 in a grotty old gray T-shirt that, to be honest, looks nothing like a dress, and my hair a mess, and my face all red from lugging carrier bags full of lavender honey. And she\u2019s in an immaculate white suit.</p><p>\u201cRebecca!\u201d she says, and puts her hand over her mouth in mock dismay. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to know I\u2019m here! Just pretend you haven\u2019t seen me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat... what do you mean?\u201d I say, trying not to sound as disconcerted as I feel. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just popped in for a quick introductory meeting with the new associates,\u201d says Alicia. \u201cYou know my parents only live five miles away? So it made sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d I say. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Luke\u2019s given us all strict instructions,\u201d says Alicia, \u201cwe\u2019re not allowed to bother you. After all, this is your holiday!\u201d</p><p>And there\u2019s something about the way she says it that makes me feel like a child.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind,\u201d I say robustly. \u201cWhen something as... as important as this is going on. In fact, Luke and I were talking about it earlier on actually. Over breakfast.\u201d</p><p>OK, so I only mentioned breakfast to remind her that Luke and I are going out together. Which I know is really pathetic. But somehow, whenever I\u2019m talking to Alicia, I feel we\u2019re in some secret little competition, and if I don\u2019t fight back, she\u2019ll think she\u2019s won.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d says Alicia. \u201cHow sweet.\u201d Her eyes narrow slightly. \u201cSo \u2014 what do you think of this whole enterprise? You must have an opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s great,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cReally great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind?\u201d Her eyes are probing my face.</p><p>\u201cWell... not really.\u201d I shrug. \u201cI mean, it was supposed to be a holiday, but if it\u2019s that important\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean the meetings!\u201d says Alicia, laughing a little. \u201cI mean \u2014 this whole deal. The whole New York thing.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to reply \u2014 then feebly close it again. What New York thing?</p><p>And like a buzzard sensing weakness, she leans forward, a tiny, malicious smile at her lips. \u201cYou do know, don\u2019t you, Rebecca, that Luke\u2019s going to move to New York?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t move for shock. That\u2019s what he\u2019s so excited about. Luke\u2019s moving to New York. But... but why hasn\u2019t he told me?</p><p>My face feels rather hot and there\u2019s a horrible thickening in my chest. He\u2019s going to New York and he hasn\u2019t even told me.</p><p>\u201cRebecca?\u201d</p><p>My head jerks up, and I quickly force a smile onto my face. I can\u2019t let Alicia realize this is all news to me. I just can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOf course I know about it,\u201d I say huskily, and clear my throat. \u201cI know all about it. But I... I never discuss business in public. Much better to be discreet, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, absolutely,\u201d she answers \u2014 and the way she looks at me makes me think she isn\u2019t convinced for a minute. \u201cSo... will you be going out there too?\u201d</p><p>I stare back, my lips trembling, unable to think of an answer, my face growing pinker and pinker \u2014 when suddenly, thank God, a voice behind me says, \u201cRebecca Bloomwood.

A man in uniform is approaching the desk, holding my huge, battered Special Express parcel, which I\u2019d honestly given up for lost. All my things, at last. All my carefully chosen outfits. I can wear anything I like tonight!</p><p>But somehow... I don\u2019t really care anymore. I just want to go off somewhere and be on my own and think for a bit.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d I say, managing a smile. \u201cI\u2019m Rebecca Bloomwood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right!\u201d says the man. \u201cThat\u2019s nice and easy then.

OK, let\u2019s just go over the facts. Luke\u2019s making plans to move to New York. And he hasn\u2019t told me.</p><p>Yet. He hasn\u2019t told me yet.</p><p>As I think this through, my numbness starts to melt away. Of course. He\u2019s probably planning to tell me everything this evening. Waiting for the right moment. That\u2019s probably why he brought me here in the first place. He couldn\u2019t know that Alicia would stick her oar in, could he?</p> <p>Feeling better already, I reach for a complimentary packet of biscuits, tear it open, and begin to munch one.

Don\u2019t do... that other thing you shouldn\u2019t do.</p><p>I\u2019ve just finished my third biscuit and have switched on the television to watch Ready Steady Cook, when the door opens and Luke comes in. His eyes are sparkling and he seems full of a suppressed energy. I stare at him, feeling a little weird.</p><p>I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to tell me. He wouldn\u2019t just move to America without saying anything.</p><p>\u201cDid your meetings go well?\u201d I say, my voice feeling false.</p><p>\u201cVery well, thanks,\u201d says Luke, taking off his tie and throwing it on the bed. \u201cBut let\u2019s not talk about that.\u201d He smiles at me. \u201cDid you have a good day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, thanks!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want to go for a walk? Come on. I haven\u2019t seen you all day.\u201d He reaches for my hand, pulls me up off the bed, and puts his arms round my waist. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d he says against my hair, and his arms tighten around my body.</p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d I give a little laugh. \u201cWell, you know... perhaps I should come to your meetings, and hear what they\u2019re all about!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t enjoy them,\u201d says Luke, returning my laugh. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go out.\u201d</p><p>We head down the stairs and out of the heavy front door and start walking over the grass toward a group of trees. The sun is still warm, and some people are playing croquet and drinking Pimms. After a while I take off my sandals and walk along barefoot, feeling myself relax.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d says Luke casually as we get near a large oak tree. And I\u2019m about to reply, \u201cNo, I\u2019ve just had three biscuits,\u201d when I see it, waiting for us in the long grass.</p><p>A red-and-white checked picnic blanket. A little wicker hamper. And... is that a bottle of champagne? I turn toward Luke in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cIs this... did you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d says Luke, touching my cheek, \u201cis in some small way to make up. You\u2019ve been so incredibly understanding, Becky.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d I say awkwardly. \u201cIf it was for something as important as...\u201d I hesitate. \u201cAs... well, whatever amazing opportunity this might be...\u201d</p><p>I look at Luke expectantly. This is the perfect moment for him to tell me.</p><p>\u201cEven so,\u201d says Luke. He moves away and reaches for the champagne bottle and I sit down, trying not to give away my disappointment.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to ask him. If he wants to tell me he can. If he doesn\u2019t want to... then he must have his reasons.</p><p>But there\u2019s no harm in prompting him, is there?</p><p>\u201cI love the countryside!\u201d I exclaim as Luke hands me my champagne. \u201cAnd I love cities, too.\u201d I gesture vaguely in the air. \u201cLondon... Paris...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheers,\u201d says Luke, raising his glass.</p><p>\u201cCheers.\u201d I take a sip of champagne and think quickly. \u201cSo... um... you\u2019ve never really told me much about your family.\u201d</p><p>Luke looks up, a bit surprised.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t I? Well, there\u2019s me and my sister... and Mum and Dad...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd your real mother, of course.\u201d Casual, Becky.

Luke stares ahead, frowning slightly, and I watch him, my heart thumping. Then he turns to me, and I feel a spasm of fright. What\u2019s he going to say? Is he going to tell me he\u2019s moving thousands of miles away?</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I say, my voice half-strangled by nerves.</p><p>\u201cI really think you and my mother would love each other.

And I know I should just ask him outright. I should casually say, \u201cSo what\u2019s this I hear about New York, Luke?\u201d and wait and see what he says. But somehow I can\u2019t bring myself to do it.</p><p>I mean, for a start, he\u2019s made it plain enough that he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. If I confront him, he might think I\u2019ve been trying to find out stuff behind his back. And for another start, Alicia might have got it wrong \u2014 or even be making it up. (She\u2019s quite capable of it, believe me. When I was a financial journalist she once sent me to the completely wrong room for a press conference \u2014 and I\u2019m sure it was deliberate.) So until I\u2019m absolutely certain of my facts, there\u2019s no point saying anything.</p><p>At least, this is what I tell myself. But I suppose if I\u2019m really honest, the reason is that I just can\u2019t bear the idea of Luke turning to me and giving me a kind look and saying, \u201cRebecca, we\u2019ve had a lot of fun, but...\u201d</p><p>So I end up saying nothing and smiling a lot \u2014 even though inside, I feel more and more miserable. As we arrive back outside my flat, I want to turn to him and wail, \u201cAre you going to New York? Are you?\u201d</p><p>But instead, I give him a kiss, and say lightly, \u201cYou will be OK for Saturday, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>It turns out Luke\u2019s got to fly off to Zurich tomorrow and have lots of meetings with finance people. Which of course is very important and I completely understand that. But Saturday is Tom and Lucy\u2019s wedding at home, and that\u2019s even more important. He just has to be there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it,\u201d he says. \u201cI promise.\u201d He squeezes my hand and I get out of the car and he says he has to shoot off. And then he\u2019s gone.</p><p>Disconsolately, I open the door to our flat, and a moment later Suze comes out of the door of her room, dragging a full black bin liner along the ground.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I reply, trying to sound cheerful. \u201cI\u2019m back!\u201d</p><p>Suze disappears out of our door, and I hear her lugging her black bag down the stairs and out of the main front door \u2014 then bounding up to our flat again.</p><p>\u201cSo, how was it?\u201d she says breathlessly, closing the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cIt was fine,\u201d I say, walking into my bedroom. \u201cIt was... nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice?\u201d Suze\u2019s eyes narrow and she follows me in. \u201cOnly nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was... good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood? Bex, what\u2019s wrong? Didn\u2019t you have a lovely time?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t really planning to say anything to Suze, because after all, I don\u2019t know the facts yet. Plus I read in a magazine recently that couples should try to sort their problems out alone, without recourse to others. But as I look at her warm, friendly face, I just can\u2019t help it, I hear myself blurting out, \u201cLuke\u2019s moving to New York.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d says Suze, missing the point. \u201cFantastic! God, I love New York. I went there three years ago, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuze, he\u2019s moving to New York \u2014 but he hasn\u2019t told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d says Suze, looking taken aback. \u201cOh, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to bring it up, because I\u2019m not supposed to know, but I keep thinking, why hasn\u2019t he told me? Is he just going to... go?\u201d My voice is rising in distress. \u201cWill I just get a postcard from the Empire State Building saying, \u2018Hi, I live in New York now, love Luke\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d says Suze at once. \u201cOf course not! He wouldn\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Definitely not.\u201d Suze folds her arms and thinks for a few moments \u2014 then looks up. \u201cAre you absolutely sure he hasn\u2019t told you? Like, maybe when you were half asleep or daydreaming or something?\u201d</p><p>She looks at me expectantly and for a few moments I think hard, wondering if she could be right. Maybe he told me in the car and I just wasn\u2019t listening. Or last night, while I was eyeing up that girl\u2019s Lulu Guinness handbag in the bar... But then I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sure I\u2019d remember if he\u2019d mentioned New York.\u201d I sink down miserably onto the bed. \u201cHe\u2019s just not telling me because he\u2019s going to chuck me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not!\u201d retorts Suze. \u201cHonestly, Bex, men never mention things. That\u2019s just what they\u2019re like.\u201d She picks her way over a pile of CDs and sits cross-legged on the bed beside me. \u201cMy brother never mentioned when he got done for drugs. We had to find it out from the paper! And my father once bought a whole island without telling my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes! And then he forgot about it, too. And he only remembered when he got this letter out of the blue inviting him to roll the pig in the barrel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, this ancient ceremony thing,\u201d says Suze vaguely. \u201cMy dad gets to roll the first pig, because he owns the island.\u201d Her eyes suddenly brighten. \u201cIn fact, he\u2019s always looking for people to do it instead of him. I don\u2019t suppose you fancy doing it this year, do you? You get to wear this funny hat, and you have to learn a poem in Gaelic, but it\u2019s quite easy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuze\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d says Suze hurriedly. \u201cSorry.\u201d She leans back on my pillow and chews a fingernail thoughtfully. Then suddenly she looks up. \u201cHang on a minute. Who told you about New York? If it wasn\u2019t Luke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlicia,\u201d I say gloomily. \u201cShe knew all about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlicia?\u201d Suze stares at me. \u201cAlicia Bitch Longlegs? Oh, for goodness\u2019 sake. She\u2019s probably making it up. Honestly, Bex, I\u2019m surprised you even listened!\u201d</p><p>And she sounds so sure that I feel my heart giving a joyful leap. Of course. That must be the answer. Didn\u2019t I suspect it myself? Didn\u2019t I tell you what Alicia was like?</p><p>The only thing \u2014 tiny niggle \u2014 is I\u2019m not sure Suze is completely 100 percent unbiased here. There\u2019s a bit of history between Suze and Alicia, which is that they both started working at Brandon Communications at the same time \u2014 but Suze got the sack after three weeks and Alicia went on to have a high-flying career. Not that Suze really wanted to be a PR girl, but still.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say doubtfully. \u201cWould Alicia really do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she would!\u201d says Suze. \u201cShe\u2019s just trying to wind you up. Come on, Bex, who do you trust more? Alicia or Luke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cLuke, of course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, then!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I say, suddenly feeling more cheerful. \u201cYou\u2019re right! I should just trust him, shouldn\u2019t I? I shouldn\u2019t listen to gossip and rumors!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Here are your letters. And your messages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, thanks!\u201d I say, and take the bundle with a little pang of excited hope. Because you never know, do you, what might have happened while you\u2019re away? Maybe one of these envelopes is a letter from a long-lost friend, or an exciting job offer, or news that I\u2019ve won a holiday!</p><p>But of course, they aren\u2019t. It\u2019s just one boring old bill after another, which I leaf through dismissively before dropping the whole lot to the floor without even opening them.</p><p>You know, this always happens. Whenever I go away, I always think I\u2019ll come back to mountains of exciting post, with parcels and telegrams and letters full of scintillating news \u2014 and I\u2019m always disappointed. In fact, I really think someone should set up a company called holidaypost.com which you would pay to write you loads of exciting letters, just so you had something to look forward to when you got home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I turn to my phone messages \u2014 and Suze has written them down really conscientiously:</p><p>Your mum \u2014 what are you wearing to Tom and Lucy\u2019s wedding?Your mum \u2014 don\u2019t wear violet as it will clash with her hat.Your mum \u2014 Luke does know it\u2019s morning dress?Your mum \u2014 Luke is definitely coming, isn\u2019t he?David Barrow \u2014 please could you ring him.Your mum\u2014</p><p>Hang on.

What on earth\u2019s\u2014</p><p>Oh yes. That trendy boutique in Hampstead. But I\u2019ve only been in there about once, and that was ages ago. So why is he calling me?</p><p>\u201cMay I say, first, what an honor it is to have a television personality of your caliber as one of our customers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Well \u2014 thank you!\u201d I say, beaming at the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure, actually.\u201d</p> <p>This is great. I know exactly why he\u2019s calling. They\u2019re going to give me some free clothes, aren\u2019t they? Or maybe... yes! They want me to design a new line for them! God, yes. I\u2019ll be a designer. They\u2019ll call it the Becky Bloomwood collection. Simple, stylish, wearable garments, with maybe one or two evening dresses...</p><p>\u201cThis is simply a courtesy call,\u201d says David Barrow, interrupting my thoughts. \u201cI just want to ensure that you are completely happy with our service and ask if you have any other needs we can help you with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell \u2014 thanks!\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m very happy, thanks!

This isn\u2019t a courtesy call at all, is it? He doesn\u2019t want me to design a collection of clothes. He\u2019s phoning about money!</p><p>I feel slightly outraged. Surely people aren\u2019t just allowed to telephone you in your own home and demand money with no warning? I mean, obviously I\u2019m going to pay them. Just because I don\u2019t send a check off the moment the bill comes through the letter box...</p><p>\u201cIt has been three months now since your first bill,\u201d David Barrow is saying. \u201cAnd I must inform you that our policy after the three-month period is to hand over all outstanding accounts to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well,\u201d I interrupt coolly. \u201cMy... accountants are dealing with all my bills at the moment.

So cleansing! You should try it! So \u2014 who was David Barrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust some stupid bill I hadn\u2019t paid,\u201d I say. \u201cHonestly!

You know. Just one or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have paid them off!\u201d I say in surprise. \u201cI paid them all off in June.

Where did that go?</p><p>\u201cHow much is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... it\u2019s enough,\u201d I reply, pushing it quickly back inside, before she can see that it\u2019s well over \u00a3400.</p> <p>I turn away, trying to keep calm. But I feel alarmed and slightly angry. This is all wrong. The whole point is, I paid off my cards. I paid them off. I mean, what\u2019s the point of paying off all your credit cards if they all just go and sprout huge new debts again? What is the point?</p><p>\u201cLook, Bex, don\u2019t worry,\u201d says Suze. \u201cYou\u2019ll be OK! I just won\u2019t cash your rent check this month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. You\u2019ve been good enough to me already! I don\u2019t want to owe you anything. I\u2019d rather owe M&amp;S.\u201d I look round and see her anxious face. \u201cSuze, don\u2019t worry! I can easily put this lot off for a bit.\u201d I hit the letter. \u201cAnd meanwhile, I\u2019ll get a bigger overdraft or something. In fact, I\u2019ve just asked the bank for an extension \u2014 so I can easily ask for a bit more. In fact, I\u2019ll phone them right now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, this minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>I pick up the phone again, reach for an old bank statement, and dial the Endwich number.</p><p>\u201cYou see, there really isn\u2019t a problem,\u201d I say reassuringly. \u201cOne little phone call is all it\u2019ll take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour call is being transferred to the Central Endwich Call Center,\u201d comes a tinny voice down the line. \u201cKindly memorize the following number for future use: 0800...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d says Suze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being transferred to some central system,\u201d I say, as Vivaldi\u2019s Four Seasons starts to play. \u201cThey\u2019ll probably be really quick and efficient. This is great, isn\u2019t it? Doing it all over the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Endwich Bank!\u201d says a new woman\u2019s voice in my ear. \u201cPlease key in your account number.\u201d</p><p>What\u2019s my account number? Shit! I\u2019ve got no idea\u2014</p><p>Oh yes. On my bank statement.</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d says a voice as I finish pressing the numbers. \u201cNow please key in your personal identification number.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>Personal identification number? I didn\u2019t know I had a personal identification number. Honestly! They never told me\u2014</p><p>Actually... maybe that does ring a slight bell.</p><p>Oh God. What was it again? Seventy-three-something? Thirty-seven-something?</p><p>\u201cPlease key in your personal identification number,\u201d repeats the voice pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t know my bloody personal identification number!\u201d I say. \u201cQuick, Suze, if you were me, what would you choose as a personal identification number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh!\u201d says Suze. \u201cUm... I\u2019d choose... um... 1234?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease key in your personal identification number,\u201d says the voice, with a definite edge to it this time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>God, this is really stressful.</p><p>\u201cTry my number for my bicycle lock,\u201d suggests Suze. \u201cIt\u2019s 435.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuze \u2014 I need my number.

Welcome to the Endwich Central Call Center. I\u2019m Dawna, how can I help you, Miss Bloomwood?\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u201cOh, hi!\u201d I say, taken aback. \u201cAre you real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d says Dawna, and laughs. \u201cI\u2019m real. Can I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm... yes. I\u2019m phoning because I need an extension to my overdraft. A few hundred pounds if that\u2019s all right. Or, you know, more, if you\u2019ve got it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d says Dawna pleasantly. \u201cWas there a specific reason? Or just a general need?\u201d</p><p>She sounds so nice and friendly, I feel myself start to relax.</p> <p>\u201cWell, the thing is, I\u2019ve had to invest quite a bit in my career recently, and a few bills have come in, and kind of... taken me by surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d says Dawna sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not as if I\u2019m in trouble. It\u2019s just a temporary thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA temporary thing,\u201d she echoes, and I hear her typing in the background.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I have been letting things mount up a bit. But the thing was, I paid everything off! I thought I\u2019d be able to relax for a bit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you understand?\u201d I give a relieved beam to Suze, who offers me thumbs-up in return. This is more like it. Just one quick and easy call, like in the adverts. No nasty letters, no tricky questions...</p><p>\u201cI completely understand,\u201d Dawna\u2019s saying. \u201cIt happens to us all, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo \u2014 can I have the overdraft?\u201d I say joyfully.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not authorized to extend your overdraft by more than \u00a350,\u201d says Dawna in surprise. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to get in touch with your branch overdraft facilities director. Who is a... let me see... Fulham... a Mr. John Gavin.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the phone in dismay.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve already written to him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s all right, then, isn\u2019t it? Now, is there anything else I can help you with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. Thanks anyway.\u201d</p><p>I put down the phone disconsolately.</p><p>\u201cStupid bank. Stupid call center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are they going to give you the money?\u201d asks Suze.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It all depends on this John Gavin bloke.\u201d I look up and see Suze\u2019s anxious face. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll say yes,\u201d I add hastily. \u201cHe\u2019s just got to review my file. It\u2019ll be fine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose if you just don\u2019t spend anything for a while, you\u2019ll easily get back on track, won\u2019t you?\u201d she says hopefully. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re making loads of money from the telly, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say after a pause, not liking to tell her that after rent, taxi fares, meals out, and outfits for the show, it doesn\u2019t actually amount to that much.</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s your book, too...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy book?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a moment I stare at her blankly. Then suddenly, with a lift of the heart, I remember. Of course! My self-help book! I\u2019ve been meaning to do something about that.</p><p>Well, thank God. This is the answer. All I have to do is write my book really quickly and get a nice big check \u2014 and then I\u2019ll pay all these cards off and everything will be happy again. Ha. I don\u2019t need any stupid overdraft. I\u2019ll start straight away. This evening!</p><p>And the truth is, I\u2019m rather looking forward to getting down to my book. I have so many important themes I want to address in it, like poverty and wealth, comparative religion, philosophy maybe. I mean, I know the publishers have just asked for a simple self-help book, but there\u2019s no reason why I can\u2019t encompass broader questions too, is there?</p><p>In fact, if it does really well, I might give lectures. God, that would be great, wouldn\u2019t it? I could become a kind of lifestyle guru and tour the world, and people would flock to see me, and ask my advice on all sorts of issues\u2014</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d says Suze, appearing at my door in a towel, and I jump guiltily. I\u2019ve been sitting at my computer for quite a while now but I haven\u2019t actually turned it on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just thinking,\u201d I say, hastily reaching to the back of the computer and flipping the switch. \u201cYou know, focusing my thoughts and... and letting the creative juices meld into a coherent pattern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d says Suze, and looks at me in slight awe. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing. Is it hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I say, after a bit of thought. \u201cIt\u2019s quite easy, actually.\u201d</p><p>The computer suddenly bursts into a riot of sound and color, and we both stare at it, mesmerized.</p> <p>\u201cWow!\u201d says Suze again. \u201cDid you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm... yes,\u201d I say. Which is true. I mean, I did switch it on.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re so clever, Bex,\u201d breathes Suze. \u201cWhen do you think you\u2019ll finish it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, quite soon, I expect,\u201d I say breezily. \u201cYou know. Once I get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll leave you to get on with it, then,\u201d says Suze. \u201cI just wanted to borrow a dress for tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d I say, with interest. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVenetia\u2019s party,\u201d says Suze. \u201cD\u2019you want to come too? Oh, go on, come! Everyone\u2019s going!\u201d</p><p>For a moment I\u2019m tempted. I\u2019ve met Venetia a few times, and I know she gives amazing parties at her parents\u2019 house in Kensington.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say at last. \u201cI\u2019d better not. I\u2019ve got work to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh well.\u201d Suze\u2019s face droops briefly. \u201cBut I can borrow a dress, can I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d I screw up my face for a moment, thinking hard. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you wear my new Tocca dress with your red shoes and my English Eccentrics wrap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent!\u201d says Suze, going to my wardrobe. \u201cThanks, Bex. And... could I borrow some knickers?\u201d she adds casually. \u201cAnd some tights and makeup?\u201d</p><p>I turn in my chair and give her a close look.</p><p>\u201cSuze \u2014 when you decluttered your room, did you keep anything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I did!\u201d she says, a little defensively. \u201cYou know. A few things.\u201d She meets my gaze. \u201cOK, perhaps I went a bit too far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any underwear left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... no. But you know, I feel so good, and kind of positive about life \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter! It\u2019s feng shui. You should try it!\u201d</p><p>I watch as Suze gathers up the dress and underwear and rifles through my makeup bag. Then she leaves the room and I stretch my arms out in front of me, flexing my fingers. Right. To work.</p><p>I open a file, type \u201cChapter One,\u201d and stare at it proudly. Chapter One! This is so cool! Now all I have to do is come up with a really memorable, striking opening sentence.</p><p>I sit quite still for a while, concentrating on the empty screen in front of me, then type briskly,</p><p>Finance is the</p><p>I stop, and take a sip of Diet Coke. Obviously the right sentence takes a bit of honing. You can\u2019t just expect it to land straight in your head.</p><p>Finance is the most</p><p>God, I wish I were writing a book about clothes. Or makeup. Becky Bloomwood\u2019s Guide to Lipstick.</p><p>Anyway, I\u2019m not. So concentrate.</p><p>Finance is something which</p><p>You know, my chair\u2019s quite uncomfortable. I\u2019m sure it can\u2019t be healthy, sitting on a squashy chair like this for hours on end. I\u2019ll get repetitive strain injury, or something. Really, if I\u2019m going to be a writer, I should invest in one of those ergonomic ones which swivel round and go up and down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finance is very</p><p>Maybe they sell chairs like that on the Internet.

I mean, you have to look after yourself, don\u2019t you?

And I\u2019ve already noted down a few good possibilities \u2014 when all of a sudden I land on this incredible Web site which I\u2019ve never seen before, all full of office supplies. Not just boring white envelopes, but really amazing high-tech stuff. Like smart chrome filing cabinets, and cool pen holders, and really nice personalized nameplates to put on your door.</p> <p>I scroll through all the photographs, utterly mesmerized. I mean, I know I\u2019m not supposed to be spending money at the moment \u2014 but this is different. This is investment in my career. After all \u2014 this is my office, isn\u2019t it? It should be well equipped. It needs to be well equipped. In fact, I can\u2019t believe how shortsighted I\u2019ve been. How on earth was I expecting to write a book without the necessary equipment? It would be like climbing Everest without a tent.</p><p>I\u2019m so dazzled by the array of stuff you can get that I almost can\u2019t decide what to get. But there are a few essentials which I absolutely must buy.</p><p>So I click on an ergonomic swivel chair upholstered in purple to match my iMac, plus a Dictaphone which translates stuff straight into your computer. And then I find myself adding a really cool steel claw which holds up notes while you\u2019re typing, a set of laminated presentation folders \u2014 which are bound to come in useful \u2014 and a mini paper shredder. Which is a complete essential because I don\u2019t want the whole world seeing my first drafts, do I? And I\u2019m toying with the idea of some modular reception furniture \u2014 except I don\u2019t really have a reception area in my bedroom \u2014 when Suze comes back into the room.</p><p>\u201cHi! How\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>I jump guiltily, quickly click on \u201csend\u201d without even bothering to check what the final amount was, click off the Internet \u2014 and look up just as my Chapter One reappears on the screen.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re working really hard!\u201d says Suze, shaking her head. \u201cYou should take a break. How much have you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh... quite a lot,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cCan I read it?\u201d And to my horror she starts coming toward me.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cI mean \u2014 it\u2019s a work in progress. It\u2019s... sensitive material.\u201d Hastily I close the document and stand up. \u201cYou look really great, Suze. Fantastic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d She beams at me and twirls around in my dress as the doorbell rings. \u201cOoh! That\u2019ll be Fenny.\u201d</p><p>Fenella is one of Suze\u2019s weird posh cousins from Scotland. Except to be fair, she\u2019s not actually that weird anymore. She used to be as peculiar as her brother, Tarquin, and spend the whole time riding horses and shooting fish, or whatever they do. But recently she\u2019s moved to London and got a job in an art gallery, and now she just goes to parties instead. As Suze opens the front door I can hear her high-pitched voice \u2014 and a whole gaggle of girls\u2019 voices following her. Fenny can\u2019t move three feet without a huge cloud of shrieking people around her. She\u2019s like some socialite version of a rain god.</p> <p>\u201cHi!\u201d she says, bursting into my room. She\u2019s wearing a really nice pink velvet skirt from Whistles, which I\u2019ve also got \u2014 but she\u2019s teamed it with a disastrous brown Lurex polo neck. \u201cHi, Becky! Are you coming tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ve got to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh well.\u201d Fenella\u2019s face droops just like Suze\u2019s did \u2014 then brightens. \u201cThen can I borrow your Jimmy Choos? We\u2019ve got the same size feet, haven\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say. \u201cThey\u2019re in the wardrobe.\u201d I hesitate, trying to be tactful. \u201cAnd do you want to borrow a top? It\u2019s just I\u2019ve actually got the top that goes with your skirt. Pink cashmere with little beads. Really nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d says Fenny. \u201cOoh, yes! I shoved on this polo neck without really thinking.\u201d As she peels it off, a blond girl in a black shift comes in and beams at me.</p><p>\u201cHi, er... Milla,\u201d I say, remembering her name just in time. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d she says, and gives me a hopeful look. \u201cFenny said I could borrow your English Eccentrics wrap.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m lending it to Suze,\u201d I say, pulling a regretful face. \u201cBut what about... a purple shawl with sequins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please! And Binky says, have you still got that black wraparound skirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d I say thoughtfully. \u201cBut actually, I\u2019ve got another skirt I think would look even better on her...\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s about half an hour before everyone has borrowed what they want.

Ages!\u201d</p><p>My one and only date with Tarquin is one of those events I am trying very hard never to remember again, ever.</p> <p>\u201cOh well,\u201d says Suze, shrugging. \u201cSee you later. And don\u2019t work too hard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I reply, and give a world-weary sigh. \u201cOr at least, I\u2019ll try not to.\u201d</p><p>I wait until the front door bangs behind her, and the taxis waiting outside have roared off. Then I take a sip of tea and turn back to my first chapter.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Finance is very</p><p>Actually, I\u2019m not really in the mood for this anymore. Suze is right, I should have a break. I mean, if I sit here hour after hour, I\u2019ll get all jaded, and lose the creative flow. And the point is, I\u2019ve made a good start.</p> <p>I stand up and stretch, then wander into the sitting room, and pick up a copy of Tatler. It\u2019s EastEnders in a minute, and then it might be Changing Rooms or something, or that documentary about the vets. I\u2019ll just watch that \u2014 and then I\u2019ll go back to work. I mean, I\u2019ve got a whole evening ahead, haven\u2019t I? I need to pace myself.</p><p>Idly, I flick open the magazine and am scanning the contents page for something interesting when suddenly my eye stops in surprise. It\u2019s a little picture of Luke, with the caption Best of Brandon, page seventy-four! Why on earth didn\u2019t he tell me he was going to be in Tatler?</p><p>The photograph is his new official one, the one I helped him choose an outfit for (blue shirt, dark blue Fendi tie). He\u2019s staring at the camera, looking all serious and businesslike \u2014 but if you look closely at his eyes, there\u2019s a little friendly spark in there. As I stare at his face I feel a tug of affection and realize Suze is right. I should just trust him, shouldn\u2019t I? I mean \u2014 what does Alicia Bitchy-pants know about anything?</p><p>I turn to page seventy-four, and it\u2019s an article on \u201cBritain\u2019s Top Movers and Shakers.\u201d I scan down the page, and I can\u2019t help noticing that some of the movers and shakers are pictured with their partners. Maybe there\u2019ll be a picture of me with Luke! After all, somebody might have taken a picture of us together at a party or something, mightn\u2019t they? Come to think of it, we were once snapped by the Evening Standard at a launch for some new magazine, although it never actually got into the paper.</p><p>Ooh! Here he is, number thirty-four! And it\u2019s just him, in that same official photo, with not a glimpse of me. Still, I feel a twinge of pride as I see his picture (much bigger than some of the others, ha!) and a caption reading: \u201cBrandon\u2019s ruthless pursuit of success has knocked lesser competitors off the starting blocks.\u201d Then the piece starts: \u201cLuke Brandon, dynamic owner and founder of Brandon Communications, the blah-di blah-di...\u201d</p><p>I skim over the text, feeling a pleasant anticipation as I reach the section labeled \u201cVital Statistics.\u201d This is the bit where I\u2019ll be mentioned! \u201cCurrently dating TV personality Rebecca Bloomwood.\u201d Or maybe, \u201cPartner of well-known finance expert Rebecca Bloomwood.\u201d Or else\u2014</p><p>Luke James Brandon</p><p>Age: 34</p> <p>Education: Cambridge</p><p>Current status: Single.</p><p>Single?</p><p>Luke told them he was single?</p><p>A hurt anger begins to rise through me as I stare at Luke\u2019s confident, arrogant gaze. Suddenly I\u2019ve had enough of all this. I\u2019ve had enough of being made to feel insecure and paranoid and wondering what\u2019s going on. Hands trembling, I pick up the phone and jab in Luke\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, as soon as the message has finished. \u201cYes, well. If you\u2019re single, Luke, then I\u2019m single too. OK? And if you\u2019re going to New York, then I\u2019m going to... to Outer Mongolia.

What\u2019s that supposed to be? Lyrics to a pop song?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was talking about you! And the fact that you\u2019ve told the whole world you\u2019re single.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done what?\u201d says Luke, sounding amused. \u201cWhen did I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in Tatler!\u201d I say furiously. \u201cThis month!\u201d I grab for the magazine and flip it open. \u201cBritain\u2019s top movers and shakers. Number thirty-four, Luke Brandon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d says Luke. \u201cThat thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that thing!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cThat thing! And it says you\u2019re single. How do you think it felt for me to see you\u2019d said you were single?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt quotes me, does it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell... no,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t exactly quote you. But I mean, they must have phoned you up and asked you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did phone me up and ask me,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I said no comment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I\u2019m silenced for a moment, trying to think clearly. OK, so maybe he didn\u2019t say he was single \u2014 but I\u2019m not at all sure I like \u201cno comment.\u201d Isn\u2019t that what people say when things are going really badly?</p><p>\u201cWhy did you say no comment?\u201d I say at last. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say you were going out with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy darling,\u201d says Luke, sounding a little weary, \u201cthink about it. Do you want our private life splashed all over the media?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d I twist my hands into a complicated knot. \u201cOf course not. But you...\u201d I stop.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told the media when you were going out with Sacha,\u201d I say in a small voice.</p> <p>Sacha is Luke\u2019s ex-girlfriend.</p><p>I can\u2019t quite believe I just said that.</p><p>Luke sighs.</p><p>\u201cBecky, Sacha told the media about us. She would have had People magazine photographing us in the bath if they\u2019d been interested. That\u2019s the kind of girl she was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, winding the telephone cord round my finger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in that kind of thing. My clients can do what they like, but personally, I can\u2019t think of anything worse. Hence the no comment.\u201d He pauses. \u201cBut you\u2019re right. I should have thought. I should have warned you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d I say awkwardly. \u201cI suppose I shouldn\u2019t have jumped to conclusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are we OK?\u201d says Luke, and there\u2019s a warm, teasing note to his voice. \u201cAre we back on course?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about New York?\u201d I say, hating myself. \u201cIs that all a mistake, too?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long, horrible silence.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you heard about New York?\u201d says Luke at last \u2014 and to my horror, he sounds all businesslike and distant.</p><p>Oh God. Why couldn\u2019t I keep my mouth closed?</p><p>\u201cNothing really!\u201d I stammer. \u201cI... I don\u2019t know. I just...\u201d</p><p>I tail off feebly, and for what seems like hours, neither of us says anything. My heart is pounding hard, and I\u2019m clutching the receiver so hard, my ear\u2019s starting to hurt.</p><p>\u201cBecky, I need to talk to you about a few things,\u201d says Luke finally. \u201cBut now is not the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, feeling a pang of fright. \u201cWhat... sort of things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now. We\u2019ll talk when I get back, OK? Saturday. At the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say again, talking brightly to hide the nerves in my voice. \u201cOK! Well, I\u2019ll...

Your current overdraft limit vastly exceeds the bank\u2019s approved ratios. I cannot see any need for this excessive level of debt, nor that any genuine attempts have been made to reduce it. The situation is little short of a disgrace.</p><p>Whatever special status you have enjoyed in the past will not be continuing in the future. I will certainly not be increasing your overdraft limit as you request, and would ask as a matter of urgency that you make an appointment with me to discuss your position.</p><p>Yours sincerely,</p><p>John Gavin</p><p>Overdraft Facilities Director</p><p>Six</p><p>I ARRIVE AT MY PARENTS\u2019 house at ten o\u2019clock on Saturday, to find the street full of festivity. There are balloons tied to every tree, our drive is full of cars, and a billowing marquee is just visible from next door\u2019s garden. I get out of my car, reach for my overnight bag, then just stand still for a few moments, staring at the Websters\u2019 house. God, this is strange. Tom Webster getting married. I can hardly believe it. To be honest \u2014 and this may sound a bit mean \u2014 I can hardly believe that anyone would want to marry Tom Webster. He has smartened up his act recently, admittedly. He\u2019s got a few new clothes, and a better hairstyle. But his hands are still all huge and clammy \u2014 and frankly, he\u2019s not Brad Pitt.</p> <p>Still, that\u2019s the point of love, I think, closing my car door with a bang. You love people despite their flaws. Lucy obviously doesn\u2019t mind that Tom\u2019s got clammy hands \u2014 and he obviously doesn\u2019t mind that her hair\u2019s all flat and boring. It\u2019s quite romantic, I suppose.</p><p>As I\u2019m standing there, gazing at the house, a girl in jeans with a circlet of flowers in her hair appears at the Websters\u2019 front door. She gives me an odd, almost aggressive look, then disappears inside the house again. One of Lucy\u2019s bridesmaids, obviously. I expect she\u2019s a bit nervous, being seen in her jeans.</p><p>Lucy\u2019s probably in there too, it occurs to me \u2014 and instinctively I turn away. I know she\u2019s the bride and everything, but to be honest, I\u2019m not desperately looking forward to seeing Lucy again. I\u2019ve only met her a couple of times and we\u2019ve never jelled. Probably because she had the idea I was in love with Tom. Still, at least when Luke arrives I\u2019ll finally be able to prove them all wrong.</p><p>At the thought of Luke, there\u2019s a painful stab in my chest, and I take a deep, slow breath to calm myself. I\u2019m determined I\u2019m not going to put the cart before the horse this time. I\u2019m going to keep an open mind, and see what he says today. And if he does tell me he\u2019s moving away to New York then I\u2019ll just... deal with it. Somehow.</p><p>Anyway. Don\u2019t think about it now. Briskly I head for the front door and let myself in. I head for the kitchen and find my dad drinking coffee in his waistcoat, while Mum, dressed in a nylon cape with her hair in curlers, is buttering a round of sandwiches.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s right,\u201d she\u2019s saying as I walk in. \u201cIt\u2019s not right. They\u2019re supposed to be leading our country, and look at them. They\u2019re a mess! Dowdy jackets, dreadful ties...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think the ability to govern is affected by what you wear, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Mum,\u201d I say, dumping my bag on the floor. \u201cHi, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the principle of the thing!\u201d says Mum. \u201cIf they\u2019re not prepared to make an effort with their dress, then why should they make any effort with the economy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hardly the same thing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s exactly the same thing. Becky, you think the chancellor should dress more smartly, don\u2019t you? All this lounge suit nonsense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say vaguely. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see? Becky agrees with me. Now, let me have a look at you, darling.\u201d She puts down her knife and surveys me properly, and I feel myself glowing a little, because I know I look good. I\u2019m wearing a shocking pink dress and jacket, a Philip Treacy feathered hat, and the most beautiful black satin shoes, each decorated with a single gossamer butterfly. \u201cOh, Becky,\u201d says Mum at last. \u201cYou look lovely. You\u2019ll upstage the bride!\u201d She reaches for my hat and looks at it. \u201cThis is very unusual! How much did it cost?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cErm... I can\u2019t remember,\u201d I say vaguely. \u201cMaybe... fifty quid?\u201d</p><p>This is not quite true. It was actually more like... Well, anyway, quite a lot. Still, it was worth it.</p><p>\u201cSo, where\u2019s Luke?\u201d says Mum, popping my hat back on my head. \u201cParking the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, where\u2019s Luke?\u201d says my father, looking up, and gives a jocular laugh. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking forward to meeting this young man of yours at last.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLuke\u2019s coming separately,\u201d I say \u2014 and flinch slightly as I see their faces fall.</p><p>\u201cSeparately?\u201d says Mum at last. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s flying back from Zurich this morning,\u201d I explain. \u201cHe had to go there for business. But he\u2019ll be here, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does know the service starts at twelve?\u201d says Mum anxiously. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve told him where the church is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say. \u201cHonestly, he\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m aware that I sound slightly snappy, but I can\u2019t help it. To be honest, I\u2019m a bit stressed out myself about where Luke\u2019s got to. He was supposed to be ringing me when he landed at the airport \u2014 and that was supposed to be half an hour ago. But so far I haven\u2019t heard anything.</p><p>Still. He said he\u2019d be here.</p><p>\u201cCan I do anything to help?\u201d I ask, to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cBe a darling, and take these upstairs for me,\u201d says Mum, cutting the sandwiches briskly into triangles. \u201cI\u2019ve got to pack away the patio cushions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s upstairs?\u201d I say, picking up the plate.</p><p>\u201cMaureen\u2019s come over to blow-dry Janice\u2019s hair,\u201d says Mum. \u201cThey wanted to keep out of Lucy\u2019s way. You know, while she\u2019s getting ready.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you seen her yet?\u201d I ask interestedly. \u201cHas she got a nice dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d says Mum, and lowers her voice. \u201cBut apparently it cost \u00a33,000. And that\u2019s not including the veil!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I say, impressed. And for a second I feel ever so slightly envious. A \u00a33,000 dress. And a party... and loads of presents... I mean, people who get married have it all.</p><p>As I go up the stairs, there\u2019s the sound of blow-drying coming from Mum and Dad\u2019s bedroom \u2014 and as I go in, I see Janice sitting on the dressing-room stool, wearing a dressing gown, holding a sherry glass, and dabbing at her eyes with a hanky. Maureen, who\u2019s been doing Mum\u2019s and Janice\u2019s hair for years now, is brandishing a hair dryer at her, and a woman I don\u2019t recognize with a mahogany tan, dyed blond curly hair, and a lilac silk suit is sitting on the window seat.</p><p>\u201cHello, Janice,\u201d I say, going over and giving her a hug. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, dear,\u201d she says, and gives a sniff. \u201cA little wobbly. You know. To think of Tom getting married!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say sympathetically. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like yesterday that we were kids, riding our bikes together!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave another sherry, Janice,\u201d says Maureen comfortably, and sloshes a deep brown liquid into her glass. \u201cIt\u2019ll help you relax.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Becky,\u201d says Janice, and squeezes my hand. \u201cThis must be a hard day for you, too.\u201d</p><p>I knew it. She does still think I fancy Tom, doesn\u2019t she? Why do all mothers think their sons are irresistible?</p><p>\u201cNot really!\u201d I say, as brightly as I can. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m just pleased for Tom. And Lucy, of course...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d The woman on the window seat turns toward me, eyes narrowed suspiciously. \u201cThis is Becky?\u201d</p><p>And there\u2019s not an ounce of friendliness in her face. Oh God, don\u2019t say she thinks I\u2019m after Tom, too.</p><p>\u201cErm... yes.\u201d I smile at her. \u201cI\u2019m Rebecca Bloomwood. And you must be Lucy\u2019s mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says the woman, still staring at me. \u201cI\u2019m Angela Harrison. Mother of the bride,\u201d she adds, emphasizing \u201cthe bride\u201d as though I don\u2019t understand English.</p><p>\u201cYou must be very excited,\u201d I say politely. \u201cYour daughter getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, of course, Tom is devoted to Lucy,\u201d she says aggressively. \u201cUtterly devoted. Never looks in any other direction.\u201d She gives me a sharp glance and I smile feebly back.</p><p>Honestly, what am I supposed to do? Throw up all over Tom or something? Tell him he\u2019s the ugliest man I\u2019ve ever known? They\u2019d all still just say I was jealous.

And suddenly \u2014 which is rather bizarre \u2014 everyone in the room is completely still, waiting for my answer.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d I say. \u201cI think he must have been held up.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence, and I\u2019m aware of glances flying around the room.</p><p>\u201cHeld up,\u201d echoes Angela, and there\u2019s a tone to her voice that I don\u2019t much like. \u201cIs that right? Well, there\u2019s a surprise.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s that supposed to mean?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming back from Zurich,\u201d I explain. \u201cI should think the flight\u2019s been delayed or something.\u201d I look at Janice and, to my surprise, she flushes.</p><p>\u201cZurich,\u201d she says, nodding a little too emphatically. \u201cI see. Of course. Zurich.\u201d And she shoots me an embarrassed, almost sympathetic look.</p><p>What\u2019s wrong with her?</p><p>\u201cThis is Luke Brandon we\u2019re talking about here,\u201d says Angela, taking a puff on her cigarette. \u201cThe famous entrepreneur.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell \u2014 yes,\u201d I say, a bit surprised. I mean, I don\u2019t know any other Lukes.</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s your boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a slightly awkward silence \u2014 and even Maureen seems to be gazing at me curiously. Then, suddenly, I see a copy of this month\u2019s Tatler lying on the floor by Janice\u2019s chair. Oh God.</p><p>\u201cThat article in Tatler, by the way,\u201d I say hastily, \u201cis all wrong. He didn\u2019t say he was single. He said no comment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArticle?\u201d says Janice unconvincingly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, dear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI... I don\u2019t read magazines,\u201d says Maureen, who blushes bright red and looks away.</p><p>\u201cWe just look forward to meeting him,\u201d says Angela, and blows out a cloud of smoke. \u201cDon\u2019t we, Janice?\u201d</p><p>I stare at her in confusion \u2014 then turn to Janice, who will barely meet my eye, and Maureen, who\u2019s pretending to root about in a beauty case.</p><p>Hang on a minute.</p><p>They surely don\u2019t think\u2014</p><p>\u201cJanice,\u201d I say, trying to keep my voice steady. \u201cYou know Luke\u2019s coming. He even wrote you a reply!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he did, Becky!\u201d says Janice, staring at the floor. \u201cWell \u2014 as Angela says, we\u2019re all looking forward to meeting him.\u201d</p><p>I feel a swoosh of humiliated color fill my cheeks. What does she think? That I\u2019ve just made up that I\u2019m going out with Luke?</p> <p>\u201cWell, enjoy your sandwiches, won\u2019t you?\u201d I say, trying not to sound as flustered as I feel. \u201cI\u2019ll just... see if Mum needs me.\u201d</p><p>When I find Mum, she\u2019s on the top-floor landing, packing patio cushions into transparent plastic bags, then suctioning all the air out with the nozzle of her vacuum cleaner.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve some of these bags on order for you, by the way,\u201d she shouts over the noise of the vacuum. \u201cFrom Country Ways. Plus some turkey foil, a casserole dish, a microwave egg poacher...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any turkey foil!\u201d I yell.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for you!\u201d says Mum, turning off the vacuum. \u201cThey had a special offer \u2014 introduce a friend and receive a set of earthenware pots. So I nominated you as the friend. It\u2019s a very good catalogue, actually. I\u2019ll give it to you to have a browse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely duvet covers. I\u2019m sure you could do with a new\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum, listen!\u201d I say agitatedly. \u201cListen. You do believe I\u2019m going out with Luke, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a slightly too long pause.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d she says eventually.</p><p>I stare at her in horror.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t, do you? You all think I\u2019ve just made it up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d says Mum firmly. She puts down her hoover and looks me straight in the eye. \u201cBecky, you\u2019ve told us you\u2019re going out with Luke Brandon, and as far as Dad and I are concerned, that\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Janice and Martin. Do they think I\u2019ve made it up?\u201d</p><p>Mum gazes at me \u2014 then sighs, and reaches for another patio cushion.</p><p>\u201cOh, Becky. The thing is, love, you have to remember, they once believed you had a stalker. And that turned out to be... well. Not quite true. Didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>A cold dismay creeps over me. OK, maybe I did once kind of pretend I had a stalker. Which I shouldn\u2019t have done. But I mean, just because you invent one tiny stalker \u2014 that doesn\u2019t make you a complete nutcase, does it? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd the trouble is, we\u2019ve never actually... well, seen him with you, have we, love?\u201d Mum\u2019s continuing, as she stuffs the cushion into its transparent bag. \u201cNot in the flesh. And then there was that piece in the paper saying he was single...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say single!\u201d My voice is shrill with frustration. \u201cHe said no comment!

And instead, here I am, on my own again...</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be here,\u201d I say, almost to reassure myself. \u201cHe\u2019ll be here any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he will!\u201d exclaims Mum brightly. \u201cAnd as soon as he turns up \u2014 well, then everyone will have to eat their words, won\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>The doorbell rings and we both stiffen, staring at each other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get that, shall I?\u201d I say, trying to sound casual.</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d agrees Mum, and I can see a tiny shine of hope in her eyes.</p><p>Trying not to run, I hurry down the stairs and, with a light heart, fling the front door open. And it\u2019s... not Luke.</p><p>It\u2019s a man laden with flowers. Baskets of flowers, a bouquet of flowers, and several flat boxes at his feet.</p><p>\u201cWedding flowers,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere do you want them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, trying to hide my disappointment. \u201cActually, you\u2019ve got the wrong house, I\u2019m afraid. They need to go next door. Number 41.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d The man frowns. \u201cLet me just look at my list... Hold that, would you?\u201d</p> <p>He thrusts the bridal bouquet at me and starts rooting around his pocket.</p><p>\u201cHonestly,\u201d I say, \u201cthey need to go next door. Look, I\u2019ll just get my\u2014\u201d</p><p>I turn round, holding Lucy\u2019s bouquet with both hands, because it\u2019s quite heavy. And to my horror, Angela Harrison is just arriving at the foot of the stairs. She stares at me, and for a moment I almost think she\u2019s going to kill me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she snaps. \u201cGive me that!\u201d She wrenches the bouquet out of my hands and brings her face so close to mine I can smell the gin on her breath. \u201cListen, young lady,\u201d she hisses. \u201cI\u2019m not fooled by the smiles. I know what you\u2019re up to. And you can just forget it, all right? I\u2019m not having my daughter\u2019s wedding wrecked by some deranged little psychopath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not deranged!\u201d I exclaim furiously. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to wreck anything! I don\u2019t fancy Tom! I\u2019ve got a boyfriend!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d she says, folding her arms. \u201cThe famous boyfriend. Is he here yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he isn\u2019t,\u201d I say, and flinch at the expression on her face. \u201cBut he... he just called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just called,\u201d echoes Angela with a little sneer. \u201cTo say he can\u2019t make it?\u201d</p> <p>Why won\u2019t these people believe that Luke\u2019s coming?</p><p>\u201cActually... he\u2019s half an hour away,\u201d I hear myself saying defiantly.</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d says Angela Harrison, and gives me a nasty smile. \u201cWell \u2014 we\u2019ll see him very soon, then, won\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Oh shit.</p><p>By twelve o\u2019clock, Luke still hasn\u2019t arrived, and I\u2019m beside myself. This is a complete nightmare. Where is he? I loiter outside the church until the very last minute, desperately dialing his number, hoping against hope I\u2019m suddenly going to see him running up the road. But the bridesmaids have arrived, and another Rolls-Royce has just pulled up, and he\u2019s still not here. As I see the car door open and a glimpse of wedding dress, I hastily retreat into the church before anyone can think I\u2019m waiting outside to disrupt the bridal procession.</p><p>As I creep in, trying not to disturb the organ music, Angela Harrison darts me an evil look, and there\u2019s a rippling and whispering from Lucy\u2019s side of the church. I sit down near the back, trying to keep composed and tranquil \u2014 but I\u2019m well aware that all Lucy\u2019s friends are shooting surreptitious glances at me. What the hell has she been telling everyone?</p><p>For a second I feel like getting up and walking out. I never wanted to come to this stupid wedding anyway. I only said yes because I didn\u2019t want to offend Janice and Martin. But it\u2019s too late, the bridal march is starting, and Lucy\u2019s walking in. And I have to hand it to her, she\u2019s wearing the most drop-dead gorgeous dress I\u2019ve ever seen. I stare wistfully after it, trying not to imagine what I would look like in a dress like that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The music stops and the vicar starts talking. I\u2019m aware that people on Lucy\u2019s side of the church are still darting me little looks \u2014 but I adjust my hat and lift my chin and ignore them.</p><p>\u201c... to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony,\u201d intones the vicar, \u201cwhich is an honorable estate...\u201d</p><p>The bridesmaids have got really nice shoes, I notice. I wonder where they\u2019re from?</p><p>Shame about the dresses, though.</p> <p>\u201c... reverently, discreetly, advisedly, soberly, and in the fear of God...\u201d</p><p>He pauses to look around the congregation, just as I hear a little trilling sound coming from my bag.</p><p>Shit. It\u2019s my phone.</p><p>I pull at the zip \u2014 but it\u2019s stuck. I don\u2019t believe this. You buy an expensive bag, and the bloody zip sticks.</p><p>There\u2019s another, louder trill. At the front of the church, Angela Harrison turns round in her pew and gives me the evil eye.</p> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I mouth. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get it...\u201d</p><p>As it trills for a third time, the vicar stops talking. And oh God, now Tom and Lucy are turning round, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I gulp, giving another frantic tug at the zip. \u201cI\u2019ll just... try to...\u201d</p><p>Face burning, I stand up, squeeze my way past the row of people, and hurry out of the church. As the door clangs shut behind me I wrench so hard at the zip that I pull the stitching undone. I scrabble inside for the phone, and jab at the green button.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I say breathlessly into the mouthpiece. \u201cLuke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning!\u201d says a cheery voice. \u201cWould you be interested in adding a hundred minutes to your monthly plan?\u201d</p> <p>After carefully turning off my phone I creep back into the church, where the rest of the service goes by in a blur. When it\u2019s all over, Lucy and Tom process out, studiously ignoring me as they do so \u2014 and everyone gathers around them in the graveyard to throw confetti and take photos. I slip away without anyone noticing, and hurry feverishly up the road to the Websters\u2019 house. Because Luke must be there by now. He must. He must have arrived late, and decided not to come to the church, but go straight to the reception. It\u2019s obvious, when you think about it. It\u2019s what any sensible person would do.</p><p>I hurry through the Websters\u2019 house, which is full of caterers and waitresses \u2014 and head straight for the marquee. There\u2019s already a joyful smile on my face at the thought of seeing him, and telling him about that awful moment in the church, and seeing his face crease up in laughter\u2014</p><p>But the marquee\u2019s empty. Completely empty.</p><p>I stand there, bewildered, for a few moments \u2014 then quickly head out again and hurry toward my parents\u2019 house. Because maybe Luke went there, instead, it suddenly occurs to me. Maybe he got the time wrong, or maybe he had to get changed into his wedding outfit. Or maybe\u2014</p><p>But he\u2019s not there either. Not in the kitchen, not upstairs. And when I dial his mobile number, it clicks straight onto messages.</p><p>Slowly, I walk into my bedroom and sink down onto the bed, trying not to let myself think all the bad thoughts which are creeping into my mind.</p><p>He\u2019s coming, I tell myself again and again. He\u2019s just... on his way.</p><p>Through the window I can see Tom and Lucy and all the guests starting to arrive in next door\u2019s garden. There are lots of hats and morning suits, and waitresses handing round champagne. In fact, it all looks rather jolly. And I know I should be down there with them, but I just can\u2019t face it. Not without Luke, not all on my own.</p> <p>But after sitting there for a while, it occurs to me that by staying up here, I\u2019ll just be fueling the intrigue. They\u2019ll all think I can\u2019t face the happy couple and that I\u2019m off slitting my wrists somewhere. It\u2019ll confirm all their suspicions forever. I have to go and show my face, even if just for half an hour.</p><p>I force myself to stand up, take a deep breath, and put some fresh lipstick on. Then I walk out of the house and round to the Websters\u2019. I slip inconspicuously into the marquee through a side flap and stand watching for a moment. There are people milling about everywhere, and the hubbub is huge, and no one even notices me. Near the entrance, there\u2019s a formal lineup with Tom and Lucy and their parents, but no way am I going near that. So instead I sidle off to an empty table and sit down, and after a bit a waitress comes and gives me a glass of champagne.</p><p>For a while I just sit there, sipping my drink and watching people and feeling myself start to relax. But then there\u2019s a rustling sound in front of me. I look up \u2014 and my heart sinks. Lucy is standing right in front of me in her beautiful wedding dress, flanked by a large bridesmaid in a really unflattering shade of green. (Which I think says quite a lot about Lucy.) </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHello, Rebecca,\u201d says Lucy pleasantly \u2014 and I can just tell, she\u2019s congratulating herself on being so polite to the loony girl who nearly wrecked her wedding.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say. \u201cListen, I\u2019m really sorry about the service. I honestly didn\u2019t mean to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d says Lucy, and gives me a tight smile. \u201cAfter all, Tom and I are married. That\u2019s the main thing.\u201d And she gives her wedding-ringed hand a satisfied glance.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I say. \u201cCongratulations. Are you going on\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe were just wondering,\u201d interrupts Lucy pleasantly. \u201cIs Luke here yet?\u201d</p><p>My heart sinks.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, playing for time. \u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only that Mummy said you told her he was half an hour away. But no sign of him! Which seems a bit strange, don\u2019t you think?\u201d She raises her eyebrows innocently, and her bridesmaid gives a half-snort of laughter. I glance over Lucy\u2019s shoulder and see Angela Harrison standing with Tom, a few yards away, watching with gimlet, triumphant eyes. God, they\u2019re enjoying this, aren\u2019t they?</p><p>\u201cAfter all, that was, oh, a good two hours ago now,\u201d Lucy\u2019s saying. \u201cAt least! So if he isn\u2019t here, it does seem a teeny bit peculiar.\u201d She gives me a mock-concerned look. \u201cOr maybe he\u2019s had an accident? Maybe he\u2019s got held up in... Zurich, was it?\u201d</p> <p>I stare at her smug, mocking face, and something violent rushes to my head.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d I say before I can stop myself.</p><p>There\u2019s a stunned silence. Lucy and her bridesmaid glance at each other, while I take a deep gulp of champagne.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here?\u201d says Lucy at last. \u201cYou mean, here at the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I say. \u201cHe\u2019s... he\u2019s been here a while, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut where? Where is he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell... he was here just a few moments ago...\u201d I gesture to the chair next to me. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d says Lucy, with wide eyes. \u201cWhere is he now?\u201d And she starts to look around the marquee.</p><p>\u201cJust there,\u201d I say, pointing vaguely through the crowd. \u201cHe\u2019s wearing a morning coat...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd? What else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s... he\u2019s holding a glass of champagne...\u201d</p><p>Thank God all men look alike at weddings.</p><p>\u201cWhich one!\u201d says Lucy impatiently.</p><p>\u201cThe dark one,\u201d I say, and take another gulp of champagne. \u201cLook, he\u2019s waving at me.\u201d I lift my hand and give a little wave. \u201cHi, Luke!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere?\u201d exclaims Lucy, peering into the crowd. \u201cKate, can you see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d says the bridesmaid hopelessly. \u201cWhat does he look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s... actually, he\u2019s just disappeared,\u201d I say. \u201cHe must be getting me a drink or something.\u201d</p><p>Lucy turns to me again.</p><p>\u201cSo \u2014 how come he wasn\u2019t at the service?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to interrupt,\u201d I say after a pause, and force myself to smile naturally. \u201cWell \u2014 I won\u2019t keep you. You must want to mingle with your guests!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Lucy after a pause. \u201cYes, I will.\u201d</p><p>Giving me another suspicious look, she rustles off toward her mother, and they all start hobnobbing in a little group, shooting glances at me every so often. Then one of the bridesmaids rushes off to another group of guests, and they all start giving me glances, too. And then one runs off to another group. It\u2019s like seeing a bushfire begin.</p><p>A few moments later, Janice comes up, all flushed and teary looking, with a flowery hat perched lopsidedly on her head.</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d she says. \u201cBecky, we\u2019ve just heard that Luke\u2019s here!\u201d</p><p>And my heart plummets. Putting down the bride from hell was one thing. But I can\u2019t bring myself to lie to Janice. I just can\u2019t do it. So I quickly take a gulp of champagne, and wave my glass at her in a vague manner that could mean anything.</p><p>\u201cOh, Becky...\u201d Janice clasps her hands. \u201cBecky, I feel absolutely... Have your parents met him yet? I know your mother will be over the moon!\u201d</p><p>Oh fuck.</p><p>Suddenly I feel a bit sick. My parents. I didn\u2019t think of that.</p><p>\u201cJanice, I\u2019ve just got to go and... and powder my nose,\u201d I say, and get hastily to my feet. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Luke!\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cAnd Luke, of course!\u201d I say, and give a shrill little laugh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hurry to the portaloos without meeting anyone\u2019s eye, lock myself in a cubicle, and sit, swigging the last warm dregs of my champagne. OK, let\u2019s not panic about this. Let\u2019s just... think clearly, and go over my options.</p><p>Option One: Tell everybody that Luke isn\u2019t really here, I made a mistake.</p><p>Not unless I want to be stoned to death with champagne glasses and never show my face in Oxshott again.</p><p>Option Two: Tell Mum and Dad in private that Luke isn\u2019t really here.</p> <p>But they\u2019ll be so disappointed. They\u2019ll be mortified, and they won\u2019t enjoy the day and it\u2019ll be all my fault.</p><p>Option Three: Bluff it out \u2014 and tell Mum and Dad the truth at the end of the day.</p><p>Yes. That could work. It has to work. I can easily convince everyone Luke\u2019s here for about an hour or so \u2014 and then I\u2019ll say he\u2019s got a migraine, and has gone off to lie down quietly.</p><p>Right, this is what I\u2019m going to do. OK \u2014 let\u2019s go.</p><p>And you know, it\u2019s easier than I thought. Before long, everyone seems to be taking it for granted that Luke is around somewhere. Tom\u2019s granny even tells me she\u2019s already spotted him, and isn\u2019t he handsome and will it be my turn next? I\u2019ve told countless people that he was here just a minute ago, have collected two plates of food from the buffet \u2014 one for me, one for Luke (tipped one into the flower bed), and have even borrowed some stranger\u2019s morning coat and put it on the chair next to me, as though it\u2019s his. The great thing is, no one can prove he\u2019s not here! There are so many people milling about, it\u2019s impossible to keep track of who\u2019s here and who isn\u2019t. I should have done this ages ago.</p> <p>\u201cGroup photograph in a minute,\u201d says Lucy, bustling up to me. \u201cWe all have to line up. Where\u2019s Luke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking to some guy about property prices,\u201d I reply without hesitation. \u201cThey were over by the drinks table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, make sure you introduce me,\u201d says Lucy. \u201cI still haven\u2019t met him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK!\u201d I say, and give her a bright smile. \u201cAs soon as I track him down!\u201d I take a swig of champagne, look up \u2014 and there\u2019s Mum in her lime-green wedding outfit, heading toward me.</p><p>So far, I\u2019ve managed to avoid her and Dad completely, basically by running away whenever they\u2019ve come close. I know it\u2019s really bad of me \u2014 but I just won\u2019t be able to lie to Mum. Quickly I slip out of the marquee into the garden, and head for the shrubbery, dodging the photographer\u2019s assistant, who\u2019s rounding up all the children. I sit down behind a tree and finish my glass of champagne, staring up blankly at the blue afternoon sky.</p><p>I stay there for what seems like hours, until my legs are starting to ache and the breeze is making me shiver. Then at last, I slowly wander back, and slip inconspicuously into the tent. I won\u2019t hang around much longer. Just long enough to have a piece of wedding cake, maybe, and some more champagne...</p> <p>\u201cThere she is!\u201d comes a voice behind me.</p><p>I freeze for an instant \u2014 then slowly turn round. To my utter horror, all the guests are standing in neat rows in the center of the marquee, while a photographer adjusts a tripod.</p><p>\u201cBecky, where\u2019s Luke?\u201d says Lucy sharply. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get everybody in.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Shit.</p><p>\u201cErm...\u201d I swallow, trying to stay nonchalant. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s in the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not,\u201d says Kate the bridesmaid. \u201cI\u2019ve just been looking in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he must be... in the garden, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were in the garden!\u201d says Lucy, narrowing her eyes. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cErm... I\u2019m not sure.\u201d I look round the marquee hurriedly, wondering if I could pretend to spot him in the distance. But it\u2019s different when there are no milling crowds. Why did they have to stop milling?</p><p>\u201cHe must be somewhere!\u201d says a cheerful woman. \u201cWho saw him last?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a deathly silence. Two hundred people are staring at me. I catch Mum\u2019s anxious eye, and quickly look away again.</p><p>\u201cActually...\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cNow I remember, he was saying he had a bit of a headache! So maybe he went to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s seen him at all?\u201d cuts in Lucy, ignoring me. She looks around the assembled guests. \u201cWho here can say they\u2019ve actually seen Luke Brandon in the flesh? Anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen him!\u201d comes a wavering voice from the back. \u201cSuch a good-looking young man...\u201d</p><p>\u201cApart from Tom\u2019s gran,\u201d says Lucy, rolling her eyes. \u201cAnyone?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And there\u2019s another awful silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen his morning coat,\u201d ventures Janice timidly. \u201cBut not his actual... body,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cI knew it. I knew it!\u201d Lucy\u2019s voice is loud and triumphant. \u201cHe never was here, was he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he was!\u201d I say, trying to sound confident. \u201cI expect he\u2019s just in the\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going out with Luke Brandon at all, are you?\u201d Her voice lashes across the marquee. \u201cYou just made the whole thing up! You\u2019re just living in your own sad little fantasy land!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d To my horror, my voice is thickening, and I can feel tears pricking at my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not! Luke and I are a couple!\u201d</p><p>But as I look at all the faces gazing at me \u2014 some hostile, some astonished, some amused \u2014 I don\u2019t even feel so sure of that anymore. I mean, if we were a couple, he\u2019d be here, wouldn\u2019t he? He\u2019d be here with me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just...\u201d I say in a trembling voice. \u201cI\u2019ll just check if he\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>And without looking anyone in the eye, I back out of the marquee.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a bloody fruit loop!\u201d I hear Lucy saying. \u201cHonestly, Tom, she could be dangerous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dangerous, young lady!\u201d I hear Mum retorting, her voice shaking a little. \u201cJanice, I don\u2019t know how you could let your daughter-in-law be so rude! Becky\u2019s been a good friend to you, over the years. And to you, Tom, standing there, pretending this has nothing to do with you. And this is the way you treat her. Come on, Graham. We\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>And a moment later, I see Mum stalking out of the marquee, Dad in tow, her lime-green hat quivering on her head. They head toward the front drive, and I know they\u2019re going back to our house for a nice, calming cup of tea.</p><p>But I don\u2019t follow them. I can\u2019t bring myself to see them \u2014 or anyone.</p><p>I walk quickly, stumbling slightly, toward the other end of the garden. Then, when I\u2019m far enough away, I sink down onto the grass. I bury my head in my hands \u2014 and, for the first time today, feel tears oozing out of my eyes.</p><p>This should have been such a good day. It should have been such a wonderful, happy occasion. Seeing Tom get married, introducing Luke to my parents and all our friends, dancing together into the night... And instead, it\u2019s been spoiled for everyone. Mum, Dad, Janice, Martin... I even feel sorry for Lucy and Tom. I mean, they didn\u2019t want all this disruption at their wedding, did they?</p> <p>For what seems like ages I sit without moving, staring down at the ground. From the marquee I can hear the sounds of a band starting up, and Lucy\u2019s voice bossing somebody about. Some children are playing with a bean bag in the garden and occasionally it lands near me. But I don\u2019t flicker. I wish I could just sit here forever, without having to see any of them ever again.</p><p>And then I hear my name, low across the grass.</p><p>At first I think Lucy\u2019s right, and I\u2019m hearing imaginary voices. But as I look up, my heart gives an almighty flip and I feel something hard blocking my throat. I don\u2019t believe it.</p><p>It\u2019s him.</p><p>It\u2019s Luke, walking across the grass, toward me, like a dream. He\u2019s wearing morning dress and holding two glasses of champagne, and I\u2019ve never seen him looking more handsome.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says as he reaches me. \u201cI\u2019m beyond sorry. Four hours late is... well, it\u2019s unforgivable.\u201d He shakes his head.</p><p>I stare up at him dazedly. I\u2019d almost started to believe that Lucy was right, and he only existed in my own imagination.</p><p>\u201cWere you... held up?\u201d I say at last.</p> <p>\u201cA guy had a heart attack. The plane was diverted...\u201d He frowns. \u201cBut I left a message on your phone as soon as I could. Didn\u2019t you get it?\u201d</p><p>I grab for my phone, realizing with a sickening thud that I haven\u2019t checked it for a good while. I\u2019ve been too busy dealing with imaginary Luke to think about the real one. And sure enough, the little message icon is blinking merrily.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t get it,\u201d I say, staring at it blankly. \u201cI didn\u2019t. I thought...\u201d</p><p>I break off and shake my head. I don\u2019t know what I thought anymore.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d says Luke, sitting down beside me and handing me a glass of champagne. He runs a finger gently down my face and I flinch.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, rubbing my cheek. \u201cSince you ask, I\u2019m not all right. You promised you\u2019d be here. You promised, Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d I hunch my arms miserably round my knees. \u201cI wanted you to be there at the service, not arrive when it\u2019s all nearly over. I wanted everyone to meet you, and see us together...\u201d My voice starts to wobble. \u201cIt\u2019s just been... awful!

Nice and... dry...\u201d I break off and rub my face, trying to hide how nervous I am.</p><p>There\u2019s part of me that wants to sit here, making small talk for as long as we can. But another part is thinking, what\u2019s the point in putting it off any longer? There\u2019s only one thing I want to know. I feel a spasm of nerves in my stomach, but somehow force myself to take a deep breath and turn to him.</p><p>\u201cSo. How did your meetings in Zurich go? How\u2019s the... the new deal coming along?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m trying to stay calm and collected \u2014 but I can feel my lips starting to tremble, and my hands are twisting themselves into knots.</p><p>\u201cBecky...\u201d says Luke. He stares into his glass for a moment, then puts it down. \u201cThere\u2019s something I need to tell you. I\u2019m moving to New York.\u201d</p><p>I feel cold and heavy.

Well \u2014 OK.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence \u2014 and I force myself to look up.

I\u2019m going to New York! New York!</p><p>Everything is transformed. This is why Luke has been so secretive. We had a lovely long chat at the wedding, and Luke explained everything to me, and suddenly it all made sense. It turns out he\u2019s opening up a new office of Brandon Communications in New York, in partnership with some advertising supremo called Michael Ellis who is based in Washington. And Luke\u2019s going to go over there and head it up. He said he\u2019s been wanting to ask me all along to come with him \u2014 but he knew I wouldn\u2019t want to give up my career just to trail along with him. So \u2014 this is the best bit \u2014 he\u2019s been speaking to some contacts in television, and he reckons I\u2019ll be able to get a job as a financial expert on an American TV show! In fact, he says I\u2019ll get \u201csnapped up\u201d because Americans love British accents. Apparently one producer has already practically offered me a job just from seeing a tape Luke sent him. Isn\u2019t that great?</p><p>The reason he didn\u2019t say anything before was he didn\u2019t want to raise my hopes before things started looking definite. But now, apparently, all the investors are on board, and everyone\u2019s really positive, and they\u2019re hoping to finalize the deal as soon as possible. Michael Ellis\u2019s agency advertises for most of the big financial players \u2014 and he\u2019s already been talking to them all about the new company. So there are loads of potential clients out there for Luke, and that\u2019s before he\u2019s even started.</p> <p>And guess what? We\u2019re going over there in three days\u2019 time! Hooray! Luke\u2019s going to have meetings with some of his backers \u2014 and I\u2019m going to have some interviews with TV people and explore the city. God, it\u2019s exciting. In just seventy-two hours, I\u2019ll be there. In the Big Apple. The city that never sleeps. The\u2014</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d</p><p>Oh shit. I snap to attention and hastily smile brightly. I\u2019m sitting on the set of Morning Coffee, doing my usual phone-in, and Jane from Lincoln has been explaining over the line that she wants to buy a property but doesn\u2019t know which kind of mortgage to take out.</p><p>Oh, for goodness\u2019 sake. How many times have I explained the difference between repayment plans and endowment policies? You know, sometimes this job can be so interesting, hearing about people and their problems and trying to help them. But other times \u2014 to be honest \u2014 it\u2019s just as boring as Successful Saving ever was. I mean, mortgages again? I feel like yelling, \u201cDidn\u2019t you watch last week\u2019s show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Jane!\u201d I say, stifling a yawn. \u201cYou\u2019re right to be concerned about redemption penalties.\u201d</p> <p>As I speak, my mind begins to drift again toward New York. Just think. We\u2019ll have an apartment in Manhattan. In some amazing Upper East Side condo \u2014 or maybe somewhere really cool in Greenwich Village. Yes! It\u2019s just going to be perfect.</p><p>To be honest, I hadn\u2019t thought of Luke and me living together for... well, for ages. I reckon if we\u2019d stayed in London, perhaps we wouldn\u2019t have. I mean, it\u2019s quite a big step, isn\u2019t it? But as Luke said, this is the chance of a lifetime for both of us. It\u2019s a whole new beginning. It\u2019s yellow taxicabs and skyscrapers, and Woody Allen and Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s.</p><p>The weird thing is that although I\u2019ve never actually been to New York, I already feel an affinity toward it. Like for example, I adore sushi \u2014 and that was invented in New York, wasn\u2019t it? And I always watch Friends, unless I\u2019m going out that night. And Cheers. (Except now I come to think of it, that\u2019s Boston. Still, it\u2019s the same thing, really.)</p><p>\u201cSo really, Jane, whatever you\u2019re buying,\u201d I say dreamily, \u201cbe it a... a Fifth Avenue duplex... or an East Village walk-up... you must maximize the potential of your dollar.

The principles apply wherever you\u2019re buying. London, New York, Skegness...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd on that international note, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll have to finish,\u201d says Emma. \u201cHope that helped you, Jane, and thanks once again to Becky Bloomwood, our financial expert... do you have time for a last word, Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same message as ever,\u201d I say, smiling warmly into the camera. \u201cLook after your money...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd your money will look after you,\u201d everyone choruses dutifully.</p><p>\u201cAnd that brings us to the end of the show,\u201d says Emma. \u201cJoin us tomorrow, when we\u2019ll be making over a trio of teachers from Teddington...\u201d</p><p>\u201c... talking to the man who became a circus performer at sixty-five...\u201d says Rory.</p><p>\u201c... and giving away \u00a35,000 in \u2018Go On \u2014 Have a Guess!\u2019 Good-bye!\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a frozen pause \u2014 then everyone relaxes as the signature music starts blaring out of the loudspeakers.</p><p>\u201cSo \u2014 Becky \u2014 are you going to New York or something?\u201d says Rory.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, beaming back at him. \u201cFor two weeks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow nice!\u201d says Emma. \u201cWhat brought this on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know...\u201d I shrug vaguely. \u201cJust a sudden whim.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m not telling anyone at Morning Coffee yet about moving to New York. It was Luke\u2019s advice, actually. Just in case.</p><p>\u201cBecky, I wanted a quick word,\u201d says Zelda, one of the assistant producers, bustling onto the set with some papers in her hand. \u201cYour new contract is ready to be signed, but I\u2019ll need to go through it with you. There\u2019s a new clause about representing the image of the station.\u201d She lowers her voice. \u201cAfter all that business with Professor Jamie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d I say, and pull a sympathetic face. Professor Jamie is the education expert on Morning Coffee. Or at least he was, until The Daily World ran an expos\u00e9 on him last month in their series \u201cAre They What They Seem?\u201d revealing that he isn\u2019t a real professor at all. In fact, he hasn\u2019t even got a degree, except the fake one he bought from the \u201cUniversity of Oxbridge.\u201d All the tabloids picked up the story, and kept showing photographs of him in the dunce\u2019s hat he wore for last year\u2019s telethon. I felt really sorry for him, actually, because he used to give good advice.</p><p>And I was a bit surprised at The Daily World being so vicious. I\u2019ve actually written for The Daily World myself, once or twice, and I\u2019d always thought they were quite reasonable, for a tabloid.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t take five minutes,\u201d says Zelda. \u201cWe could go into my office\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d I say, and hesitate. Because I don\u2019t really want to sign anything at the moment. Not if I\u2019m planning to switch jobs. \u201cI\u2019m in a bit of a hurry, actually.\u201d Which is true, because I\u2019ve got to get to Luke\u2019s office by twelve, and then start getting my stuff ready for New York. (Ha! Ha-ha!) \u201cCan it wait till I come back?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Zelda. \u201cNo problem.\u201d She puts the contract back in its brown envelope and grins at me. \u201cHave a great time. Hey, you know, you must do some shopping while you\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShopping?\u201d I say, as though it hadn\u2019t occurred to me. \u201cYes, I suppose I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh yes!\u201d says Emma. \u201cYou can\u2019t go to New York without shopping! Although I suppose Becky would tell us we should put our money into a savings plan instead.\u201d</p><p>She laughs merrily and Zelda joins in. And I smile back, feeling a bit uncomfortable. Somehow, all the people at Morning Coffee have got the idea I\u2019m incredibly organized with my money \u2014 and, without quite meaning to, I\u2019ve gone along with it. Still, I don\u2019t suppose it really matters.</p><p>\u201cA savings plan is a good idea, of course...\u201d I hear myself saying. \u201cBut as I always say, there\u2019s no harm going shopping once in a while as long as you stick to a budget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you\u2019re going to do, then?\u201d asks Emma interestedly. \u201cGive yourself a budget?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, absolutely,\u201d I say wisely. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way.\u201d</p><p>Which is completely true. I mean, obviously I\u2019m planning to give myself a New York shopping budget. I\u2019ll set realistic limits and I\u2019ll stick to them. It\u2019s really very simple.</p> <p>Although what I\u2019ll do is make the limits fairly broad and flexible. Because it\u2019s always a good idea to allow some extra leeway for emergencies or one-offs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so virtuous!\u201d says Emma, shaking her head. \u201cStill \u2014 that\u2019s why you\u2019re the financial expert and I\u2019m not...\u201d Emma looks up as the sandwich man approaches us with a tray of sandwiches. \u201cOoh lovely, I\u2019m starving! I\u2019ll have... bacon and avocado.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll have tuna and sweet corn,\u201d says Zelda. \u201cWhat do you want, Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPastrami on rye,\u201d I say casually. \u201cHold the mayo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they do that,\u201d says Zelda, wrinkling her brow. \u201cThey\u2019ve got ham salad...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen a bagel. Cream cheese and lox. And a soda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoda water, do you mean?\u201d says Zelda.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s lox?\u201d says Emma puzzledly \u2014 and I pretend I haven\u2019t heard. I\u2019m not actually sure what lox is \u2014 but everyone eats it in New York, so it\u2019s got to be delicious.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever it is,\u201d says the sandwich man, \u201cI \u2019aven\u2019t got it. You can \u2019ave cheese and tomato and a nice packet of Hula Hoops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say reluctantly, and reach for my purse. As I do so, a pile of post that I picked up this morning falls out of my bag, onto the floor. Shit. Hastily, I gather all the letters up, and shove them into my Conran Shop carrier bag, hoping no one spotted them. But bloody Rory was looking straight at me.</p><p>\u201cHey, Becky,\u201d he says, giving a guffawing laugh. \u201cWas that a red bill I saw there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say at once. \u201cOf course not! It\u2019s a... a birthday card. A joke birthday card. For my accountant. Anyway, I must run. Ciao!\u201d</p><p>OK, so that wasn\u2019t quite true. It was a red bill. To be honest, there have been quite a few red bills arriving for me over the last few days, which I\u2019m completely intending to get round to paying off when I\u2019ve got the cash. But I mean, I\u2019ve got more important things happening in my life than a few crappy final demands. In a few months\u2019 time, I\u2019m going to be living on the other side of the Atlantic. I\u2019m going to be an American television star!</p> <p>Luke says I\u2019ll probably earn twice in the States what I do here. If not more! So a few crummy bills won\u2019t exactly matter then, will they? A few outstanding pounds won\u2019t exactly ruin my sleep when I\u2019m a household name and living in a Park Avenue penthouse.</p><p>God, and that\u2019ll completely suss that horrible John Gavin. Just imagine his face when I march in and tell him I\u2019m going to be the new anchorwoman on CNN, on a salary six times what he earns. That\u2019ll teach him to be so nasty. I finally got round to opening his latest letter this morning, and it actually quite upset me. What does he mean, \u201cexcessive level of debt\u201d? What does he mean, \u201cspecial status\u201d? You know, Derek Smeath would never have been so rude to me, not in a million years.</p><p>Luke\u2019s in a meeting when I arrive, but that\u2019s OK, because I don\u2019t mind hanging around. I love visiting the Brandon Communications offices \u2014 in fact, I pop in there quite a lot, just for the atmosphere. It\u2019s such a cool place \u2014 all blond-wood floors and spotlights and trendy sofas, and people rushing around being really busy and dynamic. Everyone stays really late every night, even though they don\u2019t have to \u2014 and at about seven o\u2019clock someone always opens a bottle of wine and passes it around.</p><p>I\u2019ve got a present to give his assistant Mel for her birthday, which was yesterday. I\u2019m quite pleased with it actually \u2014 it\u2019s a gorgeous pair of cushions from the Conran Shop \u2014 and as I hand over the carrier bag, I actually hear her gasp, \u201cOh, Becky! You shouldn\u2019t have!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to!\u201d I beam, and perch companionably on her desk as she admires them. \u201cSo \u2014 what\u2019s the latest?\u2019\u2019</p><p>Ooh, you can\u2019t beat a good gossip. Mel puts down the carrier bag and gets out a box of toffees, and we have a lovely old natter. I hear all about her terrible date with an awful guy her mother\u2019s been trying to set her up with, and she hears all about Tom\u2019s wedding. And then she lowers her voice and starts filling me in on all the office gossip.</p> <p>She tells me all about the two receptionists who haven\u2019t been speaking ever since they came to work in the same Next jacket and both refused to take it off \u2014 and the girl in accounts who has just come back from maternity leave and is throwing up every morning but won\u2019t admit anything.</p><p>\u201cAnd here\u2019s a really juicy one!\u201d she says, handing me the box of toffees. \u201cI reckon Alicia\u2019s having an affair in the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I stare at her in amazement. \u201cReally? With who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Ben Bridges.\u201d</p><p>I screw up my face, trying to place the name.</p><p>\u201cThat new guy who used to be at Coupland Foster Bright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim?\u201d I stare at Mel. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>I have to say I\u2019m surprised. He\u2019s very sweet, but quite short and pushy. Not what I would have said was Alicia\u2019s type.</p> <p>\u201cI keep seeing them together, kind of whispering. And the other day Alicia said she was going to the dentist \u2014 but I went into Ratchetts and there they were, having a secret lunch\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She breaks off as Luke appears at the door of his office, ushering out a man in a purple shirt.</p><p>\u201cMel, order a taxi for Mr. Mallory, would you please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Luke,\u201d says Mel, switching into her efficient secretary voice. She picks up the phone and we grin at each other \u2014 then I walk into Luke\u2019s office.</p><p>His office is so smart. I always forget how grand he is. He\u2019s got a sweeping maple desk that was designed by some award-winning Danish designer, and on the shelves in the alcove behind it are all his shiny PR awards.</p> <p>\u201cHere you are,\u201d he says, handing me a sheaf of papers. The top one is a letter from someone called \u201cHowski and Forlano, U.S. Immigration Lawyers,\u201d and as I see the words \u201cyour proposed relocation to the United States,\u201d I feel a tingle of excitement which reaches right to my fingertips.</p><p>\u201cThis is really happening, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I say, walking over to his floor-length window and gazing down at the busy street below. \u201cWe\u2019re really going to New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe flights are booked,\u201d he says, grinning at me.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know just what you mean,\u201d he echoes, and wraps me in his arms. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very exciting.\u201d</p> <p>For a while we just stand there, the two of us, looking down at the busy London street below. I can hardly believe I\u2019m planning to leave all this to live in a foreign country. It\u2019s exciting and wonderful \u2014 but just a little scary, at the same time.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think I\u2019ll get a job out there?\u201d I say, as I have every time I\u2019ve seen him in the past week. \u201cDo you honestly think I will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you will.\u201d He sounds so assured and confident, I feel myself relax into his arms. \u201cThey\u2019ll love you. You\u2019re talented, and you\u2019re charming, and you come with a record of success... no question at all.\u201d He kisses me and holds me tight for a moment. Then he moves away to his desk, frowns absently, and opens a huge file labeled \u201cNew York.\u201d No wonder it\u2019s so huge. He told me the other day that he\u2019s been working toward a New York deal for three years. Three years!</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve been planning this for so long and never told me,\u201d I say, watching him scribble something on a Post-it.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d says Luke. I clench the papers in my hands slightly harder and take a deep breath. There\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wanting to say for a while \u2014 and now is as good a moment as any.</p><p>\u201cLuke, what would you have done if I hadn\u2019t wanted to go to New York?\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s silence apart from the hum of the computer.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d want to go,\u201d says Luke at last. \u201cIt\u2019s the next obvious step for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut... what if I hadn\u2019t?\u201d I bite my lip. \u201cWould you still have gone?\u201d Luke sighs.</p><p>\u201cBecky \u2014 you do want to go to New York, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! You know I do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo \u2014 what\u2019s the point in asking what-if questions? The point is, you want to go, I want to go... it\u2019s all perfect.\u201d He smiles at me and puts down his pen. \u201cHow are your parents doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re... OK,\u201d I say hesitantly. \u201cThey\u2019re kind of getting used to the idea.\u201d</p><p>Which is sort of true. They were fairly shocked when I told them, I have to admit. In hindsight, perhaps I should have introduced Luke to them before making the announcement. Because how it happened was, I hurried into the house \u2014 where they were still sitting in their wedding gear, drinking tea in front of Countdown \u2014 and I switched off the telly and said joyfully, \u201cMum, Dad, I\u2019m moving to New York with Luke!\u201d</p> <p>Whereupon Mum just looked at Dad and said, \u201cOh, Graham. She\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>She said afterward she didn\u2019t mean it like that \u2014 but I\u2019m not so sure.</p><p>Then they actually met Luke, and he told them about his plans, and explained about all the opportunities in American TV for me \u2014 and I could see Mum\u2019s smile fading. Her face seemed to get smaller and smaller, and sort of closed in on itself. She went off to make some tea in the kitchen, and I followed her \u2014 and I could see she was upset. But she refused to show it. She just made the tea, with slightly shaking hands, and put out some biscuits \u2014 and then she turned to me and smiled brightly, and said, \u201cI\u2019ve always thought you would suit New York, Becky. It\u2019s the perfect place for you.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her, suddenly realizing what I was talking about. Going and living thousands of miles away from home, and my parents, and... my whole life, apart from Luke. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll... you\u2019ll come and visit lots,\u201d I said, my voice trembling slightly.</p><p>\u201cOf course we will, darling! All the time!\u201d</p><p>She squeezed my hand and looked away \u2014 and then we went out into the sitting room, and didn\u2019t say much more about it.</p><p>But the next morning, when we came down for breakfast, she and Dad were poring over an ad in the Sunday Times for holiday properties in Florida, which they claimed they had been thinking about anyway. As we left that afternoon, they were arguing vigorously over whether the Disneyland in Florida was better than the one in California \u2014 even though I happen to know neither of them has ever set foot near Disneyland in their lives.</p> <p>\u201cBecky, I have to get on,\u201d says Luke, interrupting my thoughts. \u201cScottish Prime\u2019s new fund launch is tomorrow, and I\u2019ve got a lot to do.\u201d He picks up the phone and dials a number. \u201cI\u2019ll see you this evening, OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say, still loitering by the window. Then, suddenly remembering, I turn round. \u201cHey, have you heard about Alicia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d Luke frowns at the receiver and puts it down.</p><p>\u201cMel reckons she\u2019s having an affair! With Ben Bridges! Can you believe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, frankly,\u201d says Luke, tapping at his keyboard. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what do you think\u2019s going on?\u201d I perch on his desk and look excitedly at him.</p><p>\u201cMy sweet\u2014\u201d says Luke patiently. \u201cI really do have to get on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. As long as they\u2019re doing their jobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople are more than just their jobs,\u201d I say reprovingly. But Luke isn\u2019t even listening. He\u2019s got that faraway, cutoff look which comes over him when he\u2019s concentrating on business.</p><p>\u201cOh well,\u201d I say, and roll my eyes. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p> <p>As I come out, Mel is not at her desk \u2014 but Alicia is standing there in a smart black suit, staring at some papers. Her face seems more flushed than usual, and I wonder with an inward giggle if she\u2019s just been canoodling with Ben.</p><p>\u201cHi, Alicia,\u201d I say politely. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>Alicia jumps, and she quickly gathers up whatever it is she\u2019s reading \u2014 then looks at me with a strange expression, as though horns have sprouted from my head.</p><p>\u201cBecky,\u201d she says slowly. \u201cWell, I never. The financial expert herself. The money guru!\u201d</p><p>What is it about Alicia? Why does everything she say sound like she\u2019s playing some stupid game?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s me. Where\u2019s Mel gone?\u201d</p><p>As I approach Mel\u2019s desk, I feel sure I left something on it. But I can\u2019t quite think what. Did I have an umbrella?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone to lunch,\u201d says Alicia. \u201cShe showed me the present you bought her. Very stylish.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say shortly.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d She gives a faint smile. \u201cI gather you\u2019re tagging along with Luke to New York. Must be nice to have a rich boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>God, she\u2019s a cow! She\u2019d never say that in front of Luke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not \u2018tagging along,\u2019 actually,\u201d I retort pleasantly. \u201cI\u2019ve got lots of meetings with television executives. It\u2019s a completely independent trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Alicia frowns thoughtfully. \u201cYour flight\u2019s on the company, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I paid for it myself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wondering!\u201d Alicia lifts her hands apologetically. \u201cWell, have a great time, won\u2019t you?\u201d She gathers up some folders and pops them into her briefcase, then snaps it shut. \u201cI must run. Ciao.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you later,\u201d I say, and watch as she walks briskly off to the lifts.</p><p>I stand there by Mel\u2019s desk for a few seconds longer, still wondering what on earth it was that I put down. Oh, I don\u2019t suppose it can be important.</p><p>I get home to find Suze in the hall, talking on the phone. Her face is all red and shiny and her voice is trembling, and at once I\u2019m seized by the terror that something awful has happened. Fearfully, I raise my eyebrows at her \u2014 and she nods frantically back, in between saying \u201cYes,\u201d and \u201cI see,\u201d and \u201cWhen would that be?\u201d</p><p>I sink onto a chair, feeling weak with worry. What\u2019s she talking about? A funeral? A brain operation? As soon as I decide to go away \u2014 this happens.</p><p>\u201cGuess what\u2019s happened?\u201d she says shakily as she puts down the phone, and I leap up.</p><p>\u201cSuze, I won\u2019t go to New York,\u201d I say, and impulsively take her hands. \u201cI\u2019ll stay here and help you get through whatever it is.

I just... don\u2019t quite believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell \u2014 what, then? Suze, what is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been offered my own line of home accessories in Hadleys. You know, the department store?\u201d She shakes her head disbelievingly. \u201cThey want me to design a whole line! Frames, vases, stationery... whatever I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d I clap a hand over my mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s fantastic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis guy just rang up, out of the blue, and said his scouts have been monitoring sales of my frames. Apparently they\u2019ve never seen anything like it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Suze!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea things were going so well.\u201d Suze still looks shell-shocked. \u201cThis guy said it was a phenomenon! Everyone in the industry is talking about it. Apparently the only shop that hasn\u2019t done so well is that one which is miles away. Finchley or somewhere.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d I say vaguely. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever even been to that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he said that had to be a blip \u2014 because all the other ones, in Fulham and Notting Hill and Chelsea, have all soared.\u201d She gives an embarrassed smile. \u201cApparently in Gifts and Goodies, around the corner, I\u2019m the number-one bestseller!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not surprised!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cYour frames are easily the best thing in that shop. Easily the best.\u201d I throw my arms around her. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, Suze. I always knew you were going to be a star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I never would have done it if it weren\u2019t for you! I mean, it was you who got me started making frames in the first place...\u201d Suddenly Suze looks almost tearful. \u201cOh, Bex \u2014 I\u2019m really going to miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say, biting my lip. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>For a while, we\u2019re both silent, and I honestly think I might start crying any second. But instead, I take a deep breath and look up. \u201cWell, you\u2019ll just have to launch a New York branch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d says Suze, brightening. \u201cYes, I could do that, couldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you could. You\u2019ll be all over the world soon.\u201d I give her a hug. \u201cHey, let\u2019s go out tonight and celebrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Bex, I\u2019d love to,\u201d says Suze, \u201cbut I can\u2019t. I\u2019m going up to Scotland. In fact\u2014\u201d She looks at her watch, and pulls a face. \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t realize how late it was. Tarquin\u2019ll be here any moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTarquin\u2019s coming here?\u201d I say in shock. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>Tarquin is Suze\u2019s cousin and is one of the richest people in Britain. (He\u2019s also one of the worst-dressed.) He\u2019s very sweet, and I never used to take much notice of him \u2014 until, a few months ago, we spent a truly toe-curling evening together. Even the memory of it makes me feel uncomfortable. Basically, the date was going fine (at least, fine given that I didn\u2019t find him attractive or have anything in common with him) \u2014 until Tarquin caught me flicking through his checkbook. Or at least, I think he did. I\u2019m still not quite sure what he saw \u2014 and to be honest, I\u2019m not keen to find out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m driving him up to my aunt\u2019s house for this dreary family party thing,\u201d says Suze. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be the only ones there under ninety.\u201d</p><p>As she hurries off to her room, the doorbell rings and she calls over her shoulder, \u201cCould you get that, Bex? It\u2019s probably him.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Oh God. I really don\u2019t feel prepared for this.</p> <p>Trying to assume an air of confident detachment I swing open the front door and say brightly, \u201cTarquin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky,\u201d he says, staring at me as though I\u2019m the lost treasure of Tutankhamen.</p><p>And he\u2019s looking as bony and strange as ever, with an odd green hand-knitted jersey stuffed under a tweed waistcoat, and a huge old fob watch dangling from his pocket. I\u2019m sorry, but surely the fifteenth richest man in England, or whatever he is, should be able to buy a nice new Timex?</p><p>\u201cWell \u2014 come on in,\u201d I say overheartily, throwing my hand out like an Italian restaurant owner.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d says Tarquin, and follows me into the sitting room. There\u2019s an awkward pause while I wait for him to sit down; in fact, I start to feel quite impatient as he hovers uncertainly in the middle of the room. Then suddenly I realize he\u2019s waiting for me to sit down, and hastily sink down onto the sofa.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a titchy?\u201d I ask politely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBit early,\u201d says Tarquin, with a nervous laugh.</p><p>(\u201cTitchy\u201d is Tarquin-speak for drink, by the way.

I just can\u2019t stop remembering awful details from our date \u2014 like when he tried to kiss me and I pretended to be absorbed in a nearby picture. Oh God. Forget. Forget.</p><p>\u201cI... I heard you were moving to New York,\u201d Tarquin says suddenly, staring at the floor. \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, unable to stop myself smiling. \u201cYes, that\u2019s the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to New York once myself,\u201d Tarquin says. \u201cDidn\u2019t really get on with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say consideringly. \u201cNo, I can believe that. It\u2019s a bit different from Scotland, isn\u2019t it? Much more... frantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d he exclaims, as if I\u2019ve said something very insightful. \u201cThat was just it. Too frantic. And the people are absolutely extraordinary. Quite mad, in my opinion.\u201d</p><p>Compared to what? I want to retort. At least they don\u2019t call water \u201cHo\u201d and sing Wagner in public.</p> <p>But that wouldn\u2019t be kind. So I say nothing, and he says nothing \u2014 and when the door opens, we both look up gratefully.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d says Suze, appearing at the door. \u201cTarkie, you\u2019re here! Listen, I\u2019ve just got to get the car, because I had to park a few streets away the other night. I\u2019ll beep when I get back, and we can whiz off. OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Tarquin, nodding. \u201cI\u2019ll just wait here with Becky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely!\u201d I say, trying to smile brightly.</p><p>Suze disappears, I shift awkwardly in my seat, and Tarquin stretches his feet out and stares at them. Oh, this is excruciating. The very sight of him is niggling at me more and more \u2014 and suddenly I realize I have to say something now, otherwise I\u2019ll disappear off to New York and the chance will be lost.</p><p>\u201cTarquin,\u201d I say, and exhale sharply. \u201cThere\u2019s something I... I really want to say to you. I\u2019ve been wanting to say it for a while, actually.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d he says, his head jerking up. \u201cWhat... what is it?\u201d He meets my eyes anxiously, and I feel a slight pang of nerves. But now I\u2019ve started, I\u2019ve got to carry on. I\u2019ve got to tell him the truth. I push my hair back, and take a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cThat jumper,\u201d I say. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t go with that waistcoat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d says Tarquin, looking taken aback. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say, feeling a huge relief at having got it off my chest. \u201cIn fact... it\u2019s frightful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I take it off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. In fact, take the waistcoat off, too.\u201d</p><p>Obediently he peels off the jumper and the waistcoat \u2014 and it\u2019s amazing how much better he looks when he\u2019s just in a plain blue shirt. Almost... normal! Then I have a sudden inspiration.</p><p>\u201cWait here!\u201d</p> <p>I hurry to my room and seize one of the carrier bags sitting on my chair. There\u2019s a jumper inside which I bought a few days ago for Luke\u2019s birthday, but I\u2019ve discovered he\u2019s already got exactly the same one, so I was planning to take it back.</p><p>\u201cHere!\u201d I say, arriving back in the sitting room. \u201cPut this on. It\u2019s Paul Smith.\u201d</p><p>Tarquin slips the plain black jumper over his head and pulls it down \u2014 and what a difference! He\u2019s actually starting to look quite distinguished.</p><p>\u201cYour hair,\u201d I say, staring critically at him. \u201cWe need to do something with that.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later I\u2019ve wetted it, blow-dried it, and smoothed it back with a bit of mousse. And... I can\u2019t tell you. It\u2019s a transformation.</p><p>\u201cTarquin, you look wonderful!\u201d I say \u2014 and I really mean it. He\u2019s still got that thin, bony look, but suddenly he doesn\u2019t look geeky anymore, he looks kind of... interesting.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d says Tarquin, staring down at himself. He looks a little shell-shocked, but the point is, he\u2019ll thank me in the long run.</p><p>A car horn sounds from outside, and we both jump.</p><p>\u201cWell \u2014 have a good time,\u201d I say, suddenly feeling like his mother. \u201cTomorrow morning, just wet your hair again and push your fingers through it, and it should look OK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d says Tarquin, looking as though I\u2019ve just given him a long mathematical formula to memorize. \u201cI\u2019ll try to remember. And the jersey? Shall I return it by post?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t return it!\u201d I say in horror. \u201cIt\u2019s yours to keep, and wear.

And as he disappears out of the door, I find myself hoping that he\u2019ll get lucky at this party, and find someone. He really does deserve it.</p><p>As I hear Suze\u2019s car drive away, I wander into the kitchen and make a cup of tea, wondering what to do for the rest of the afternoon. I was half-planning to do some more work on my self-help book. But my other alternative is to watch Manhattan, which Suze taped last night, and would be really useful research for my trip.

Is that Becky Bloomwood, by any chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, reaching for the remote control.</p><p>\u201cThis is Sally,\u201d says the girl. \u201cI\u2019m the new secretary at Morning Coffee. We met the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Erm... yes!\u201d I wrinkle my brow, trying to remember.</p><p>\u201cWe just wanted to check on which hotel you\u2019re staying at in New York, in case we need to contact you urgently.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be at the Four Seasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour... Seasons,\u201d says Sally carefully. \u201cExcellent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think they might want me to do a report from New York or something?\u201d I ask excitedly. That would be so cool! A special report from New York!</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d says Sally. \u201cAnd that\u2019s with a Mr...

I\u2019m not sure.\u201d I\u2019m squinting at the telly, wondering if I\u2019ve gone too far back. Surely they don\u2019t show that Walker\u2019s crisps ad anymore?</p><p>\u201cAnd are you staying in a room or a suite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a suite. I could find out...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t worry,\u201d says Sally pleasantly. \u201cWell, I won\u2019t trouble you anymore.

Why did Sally need to know whether I was in a suite? Unless \u2014 maybe she was just curious.</p><p>But then I forget all about it, as Gershwin\u2019s Rhapsody in Blue suddenly crashes through the air, and the screen is filled with pictures of Manhattan. I stare at the television, utterly gripped. This is where we\u2019re going! In three days\u2019 time we\u2019ll be there!

For a start, our hotel is fantastic \u2014 all limestone and marble and amazing high ceilings. We\u2019re staying in an enormous suite overlooking Central Park, with a paneled dressing room and the most incredible bath that fills up in about five seconds. Everything is so grand, and luxurious, and kind of... more. Like last night, after we arrived, Luke suggested a quick nightcap downstairs \u2014 and honestly, the martini they brought me was the hugest drink I\u2019ve ever seen. In fact, I nearly couldn\u2019t finish it. (But I managed it in the end. And then I had another one, just because it would have been churlishto refuse.) </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Plus, everyone is so nice all the time. The hotel staff smile whenever they see you \u2014 and when you say \u201cthank you,\u201d they reply, \u201cyou\u2019re welcome,\u201d which they would never do in Britain, just kind of grunt. To my amazement, I\u2019ve already been sent a lovely bouquet of flowers and an invitation to lunch from Luke\u2019s mother, Elinor, and another bouquet from the TV people I\u2019m meeting on Wednesday, and a basket of fruit from someone I\u2019ve never heard of but who is apparently \u201cdesperate\u201d to meet me!</p><p>I mean, when did Zelda from Morning Coffee last send me a basket of fruit?</p><p>I take a sip of coffee, and smile blissfully at Luke. We\u2019re sitting in the restaurant finishing breakfast before he whizzes off for a meeting, and I\u2019m just deciding what to do with my time. I haven\u2019t got any interviews for a couple of days \u2014 so it\u2019s completely up to me whether I take in a few museums, or stroll in Central Park... or... pop into a shop or two...</p><p>\u201cWould you like a refill?\u201d comes a voice at my ear, and I look up to see a smiling waiter offering me a coffeepot. You see what I mean? They\u2019ve been offering us endless coffee since we sat down, and when I asked for an orange juice they brought me a huge glass, all garnished with frosted orange peel. And as for those scrummy pancakes I\u2019ve just polished off... I mean, pancakes for breakfast. It\u2019s pure genius, isn\u2019t it?</p> <p>\u201cSo \u2014 I guess you\u2019ll be going to the gym?\u201d says Luke, as he folds up his copy of the Daily Telegraph. He reads all the papers every day, American and British. Which is quite good, because it means I can still read my Daily World horoscope.</p><p>\u201cThe gym?\u201d I say puzzledly.</p><p>\u201cI thought that was going to be your routine,\u201d he says, reaching for the FT. \u201cA workout every morning.\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m about to say, \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous!\u201d\u2014when it occurs to me that I might have rashly announced something along those lines last night. After that second martini.</p><p>Still \u2014 that\u2019s OK. I can go to the gym. In fact, it would be good to go to the gym. And then I could... well, I could always take in a few sights, I suppose. Maybe look at a few famous buildings.</p> <p>You know, I\u2019m sure I read somewhere that Bloomingdale\u2019s is quite an admired piece of architecture.</p><p>\u201cAnd then what will you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say vaguely, watching as a waiter puts a plate of French toast down on the table next to ours. God, that looks delicious. Why don\u2019t we have stuff like this in Europe? \u201cGo and explore New York, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was asking at reception \u2014 and there\u2019s a guided walking tour which leaves from the hotel at eleven. The concierge highly recommended it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d I say, taking a sip of coffee. \u201cWell, I suppose I could do that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you wanted to get any shopping out of the way?\u201d Luke adds, reaching for the Times, and I stare at him slightly incredulously. You don\u2019t \u201cget shopping out of the way.\u201d You get other things out of the way.</p> <p>Which, in fact, makes me think. Maybe I should do this tour \u2014 and then I\u2019ve got sightseeing ticked off.</p><p>\u201cThe guided tour sounds good,\u201d I say. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019ll be a great way to get to know my new home city. The Statue of Liberty, Central Park...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go to Central Park,\u201d puts in Luke.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Is it dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can be, but that\u2019s not why.\u201d Luke looks up with that serious, affectionate expression of his. \u201cThe truth is, I\u2019d love to introduce it to you myself. It\u2019s one of my favorite places in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I smile at him, feeling touched. \u201cI won\u2019t go to Central Park.\u201d</p><p>As he shakes open the Times I look at him more carefully. His jaw is set and he doesn\u2019t quite have his usual confident demeanor. In fact he looks... nervous, I realize in surprise.</p><p>\u201cFeeling all right?\u201d I say encouragingly. \u201cAll set for your meeting? Who\u2019s it with, anyway?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMason Forbes Stockbrokers,\u201d says Luke. \u201cOne of the companies I\u2019m very much hoping to sign up as a client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent! Well, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll go brilliantly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d He\u2019s silent for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s all been talk up to now. Talk and plans and promises. But now I need to start getting a few results. A few signatures on the line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get your signatures!\u201d Confidently, I pick up The Daily World. \u201cJust listen to your horoscope: \u2018A day for doing deals and winning hearts. If you have faith in yourself, others will too. You are beginning a streak of success.\u2019 \u201d I look up. \u201cYou see?

As he puts away the paper I take a sip of coffee and glance around the dining room at all the smart businessmen and groomed women sitting on luxurious striped chairs. Piano music is tinkling discreetly and I feel like I\u2019m at the hub of some cosmopolitan, civilized world. At a nearby table a woman in black is talking about the First Lady\u2019s wardrobe, and I listen eagerly until she gives me a look.</p><p>The First Lady. I mean, it sounds so much more impressive than \u201cprime minister\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, just think, Luke,\u201d I say dreamily. \u201cIn a few weeks\u2019 time, this will be our home city. We\u2019ll be real New Yorkers!\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ll have to buy a few more black things before then, I find myself thinking. Everyone here seems to wear black...</p><p>\u201cBecky\u2014\u201d says Luke. He puts down his paper \u2014 and suddenly he looks rather grave. \u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019ve been meaning to say to you. Everything\u2019s been such a rush, I haven\u2019t had a chance \u2014 but it\u2019s something I really think you need to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say apprehensively. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big step, moving to a new city, especially a city as extreme as New York. It\u2019s not the same as London...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I nod. \u201cYou have to have your nails done.\u201d</p><p>Luke gives a puzzled frown before carrying on: \u201cI\u2019ve been here many times \u2014 and even I find it overwhelming at times. The sheer pressure and pace of life here is, frankly, on another level from London.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight. So \u2014 what are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying I think you should take it slow. Don\u2019t expect to fit in straight away. You may well find it a bit of a shock to begin with.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, discomfited.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I\u2019ll be able to stand the pace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that,\u201d says Luke. \u201cI\u2019m just saying \u2014 get to know the city gradually. Get the feel of it; see if you can really see yourself living here. You may hate it! You may decide you can\u2019t possibly move here. Of course, I very much hope you don\u2019t \u2014 but it\u2019s worth keeping an open mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say slowly. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo just see how today goes \u2014 and we\u2019ll talk some more this evening. OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say, and drain my coffee thoughtfully.</p> <p>I\u2019ll show Luke I can fit into this city. I\u2019ll show him I can be a true New Yorker. I\u2019ll go to the gym, and then I\u2019ll eat a bagel, and then I\u2019ll... shoot someone, maybe?</p><p>Or maybe just the gym will be enough.</p><p>I\u2019m actually quite looking forward to doing a workout, because I bought this fab DKNY exercise outfit in the sales last year, and this is the first time I\u2019ve had the chance to wear it! I did mean to join a gym, in fact I even went and got a registration pack from Holmes Place in Fulham. But then I read this really interesting article which said you could lose loads of weight just by fidgeting. Just by twitching your fingers and stuff! So I thought I\u2019d go for that method instead, and spend the money I saved on a new dress.</p><p>But it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like exercise or anything. And if I\u2019m going to live in New York, I\u2019ll have to go to the gym every day. I mean, it\u2019s the law or something. So this is a good way to acclimatize.</p><p>As I reach the entrance to the fitness center I glance at my reflection \u2014 and I\u2019m secretly quite impressed. They say people in New York are all pencil thin and fit, don\u2019t they? But I reckon I look much fitter than some of these characters. I mean, look at that balding guy over there in the gray T-shirt. He looks like he\u2019s never been near a gym in his life!</p><p>\u201cHi there,\u201d says a voice. I look up and see a muscular guy in trendy black Lycra coming toward me. \u201cI\u2019m Tony. How are you today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks,\u201d I say, and casually do a little hamstring stretch. (At least, I think it\u2019s my hamstring. The one in your leg.) \u201cJust here for a workout.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nonchalantly I swap legs, clasp my hands, and stretch my arms out in front of me.

Or cross-country?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRound the shops, mostly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK...\u201d he says doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m often holding quite heavy things,\u201d I explain. \u201cYou know, carrier bags and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight...\u201d says Tony, not looking that convinced. \u201cWell... would you like me to show you how the machines work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I say confidently. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p> <p>Honestly, I can\u2019t be bothered listening to him explain every single machine and how many settings it has. I mean, I\u2019m not a moron, am I? I take a towel from the pile, drape it around my neck, and head off toward a running machine, which should be fairly simple. I step up onto the treadmill and survey the buttons in front of me. A panel is flashing the word \u201ctime\u201d and after some thought I enter \u201c40 minutes,\u201d which sounds about right. I mean, that\u2019s how long you\u2019d go on a walk for, isn\u2019t it? It flashes \u201cprogram\u201d and after scrolling down the choices I select \u201cEverest,\u201d which sounds much more interesting than \u201chill walk.\u201d Then it flashes \u201clevel.\u201d Hmm. Level. I look around for some advice \u2014 but Tony is nowhere to be seen.</p><p>The balding guy is getting onto the treadmill next to mine, and I lean over.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I say politely. \u201cWhich level do you think I should choose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends,\u201d says the guy. \u201cHow fit are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I say, smiling modestly. \u201cYou know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going for level 5, if it\u2019s any help,\u201d says the guy, briskly punching at his machine.</p> <p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say. \u201cThanks!\u201d</p><p>Well, if he\u2019s level 5, I must be at least level 7. I mean, frankly, look at him \u2014 and look at me.</p><p>I reach up to the machine and punch in \u201c7\u201d\u2014then press \u201cstart.\u201d The treadmill starts moving, and I start walking. And this is really pleasant! I really should go to the gym more often. Or, in fact, join a gym.</p><p>But it just shows, even if you don\u2019t work out, you can still have a level of natural baseline fitness. Because this is causing me absolutely no problems at all. In fact, it\u2019s far too easy. I should have chosen level\u2014</p><p>Hang on. The machine\u2019s tilting upward. And it\u2019s speeding up. I\u2019m running to catch up with it.</p><p>Which is OK. I mean, this is the point, isn\u2019t it? Having a nice healthy jog. Running along, panting a little, but that just means my heart is working. Which is perfect. Just as long as it doesn\u2019t get any\u2014</p><p>It\u2019s tilting again. And it\u2019s getting faster. And faster.</p><p>I can\u2019t do this. My face is red. My chest is hurting. I\u2019m panting frenziedly, and clutching the sides of the machine. I can\u2019t run this fast. I have to slow down a bit.</p> <p>Feverishly I jab at the panel \u2014 but the treadmill keeps whirring round \u2014 and suddenly cranks up even higher. Oh no. Please, no.</p><p>\u201cTime left: 38.00\u201d flashes brightly on a panel in front of me. Thirty-eight more minutes?</p><p>I glance to my right \u2014 and the balding guy is sprinting easily along as though he\u2019s running through a field of daisies. I want to ask him for help, but I can\u2019t open my mouth. I can\u2019t do anything except keep my legs moving as best I can.</p><p>But all of a sudden he glances in my direction \u2014 and his expression changes.</p><p>\u201cMiss? Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>He hastily punches at his machine, which grinds to a halt, then leaps down and jabs at mine.</p><p>The treadmill slows down, then comes to a rather abrupt standstill \u2014 and I collapse against one of the side bars, gasping for breath.</p><p>\u201cHave some water,\u201d says the man, handing me a cup.</p><p>\u201cTh-thanks,\u201d I say, and stagger down off the treadmill, still gasping. My lungs feel as if they\u2019re about to burst, and when I glimpse my reflection opposite, my face is beet red.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should leave it for today,\u201d says the man, gazing at me anxiously.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cYes, maybe I will.\u201d I take a swig of water, trying to get my breath back. \u201cI think actually the trouble is, I\u2019m not used to American machines.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCould be,\u201d says the man, nodding. \u201cThey can be tricky.

Thanks for your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny time,\u201d says the man \u2014 and as he gets back onto his treadmill I can see him smiling.</p><p>Oh God, that was really embarrassing. As I make my way, showered and changed, to the foyer of the hotel for the walking tour, I feel a little deflated. Maybe Luke\u2019s right. Maybe I won\u2019t cope with the pace of New York. Maybe it\u2019s a stupid idea, my moving here with him. I mean, if I can\u2019t keep up with a treadmill, how am I going to keep up with a whole city?</p> <p>A group of sightseers has already assembled \u2014 mostly much older than me and attired in a variety of sensible windbreakers and sneakers. They\u2019re all listening to a young, enthusiastic man who\u2019s saying something about the Statue of Liberty.</p><p>\u201cHi there!\u201d he says, breaking off as I approach. \u201cAre you here for the tour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cAnd your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca Bloomwood,\u201d I say, flushing a little as all the others turn to look at me. \u201cI paid at the desk, earlier.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, hi, Rebecca!\u201d says the man, ticking something off on his list. \u201cI\u2019m Christoph. Welcome to our group. Got your walking shoes on?\u201d He looks down at my boots (bright purple, kitten heel, last year\u2019s Bertie sale) and his cheery smile falters. \u201cYou realize this is a three-hour tour? All on foot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I say in surprise. \u201cThat\u2019s why I put these boots on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d says Christoph after a pause. \u201cWell \u2014 OK.\u201d He looks around. \u201cI think that\u2019s it, so let\u2019s start our tour!\u201d</p><p>He leads the way out of the hotel, onto Fifty-seventh Street. It\u2019s a wide and busy street, with canopied entrances and trees planted at intervals and limousines pulling up in front of expensive-looking shops. As everyone else follows Christoph briskly along the pavement, I find myself walking slowly, staring upward. It\u2019s an amazingly clear, fresh day \u2014 with almost blinding sunlight bouncing off the pavements and buildings \u2014 and as I look around I\u2019m completely filled with awe. God, this city is an incredible place. I mean, obviously I knew that New York would be full of tall skyscrapers. But it\u2019s only when you\u2019re actually standing in the street, staring up at them, that you realize how... well, how huge they are. I gaze up at the tops of the buildings against the sky, until my neck is aching and I\u2019m starting to feel dizzy. Then slowly my eyes wander down, floor by floor to shop-window level. And I find myself staring at two words. Prada and Shoes.</p><p>Ooh.</p><p>Prada Shoes. Right in front of me.</p> <p>I\u2019ll just have a really quick look.</p><p>As the others all march on, I hurry up to the window and stare at a pair of deep brown pumps with cream stitching. God, those are divine. I wonder how much they are? You know, Prada is probably really cheap over here. Maybe I should just pop in and\u2014</p><p>\u201cRebecca?\u201d</p><p>With a start I come to and look round to see the tour group twenty yards down the street, all staring at me.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say, and reluctantly pull myself away from the window. \u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be time for shopping later,\u201d says Christoph cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say, and give a relaxed laugh. \u201cSorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it!\u201d</p> <p>Of course, he\u2019s quite right. There\u2019ll be plenty of time to go shopping. Plenty of time.</p><p>Right. I\u2019m really going to concentrate on the tour.</p><p>\u201cSo, Rebecca,\u201d says Christoph brightly, as I rejoin the group. \u201cI was just telling the others that we\u2019re heading down East Fifty-seventh Street to Fifth Avenue, the most famous avenue of New York City.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d I say. \u201cThat sounds really good!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifth Avenue serves as a dividing line between the \u2018East Side\u2019 and the \u2018West Side,\u2019 \u201d continues Christoph. \u201cAnyone interested in history will like to know that...\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m nodding intelligently as he speaks, and trying to look interested. But as we walk down the street, my head keeps swiveling from left to right, like someone watching a tennis game. Christian Dior, Herm`es, Chanel... This street is just incredible. If only we could just slow down a bit, and have a proper look \u2014 but Christoph is marching on ahead like a hike leader, and everybody else in the group is following him happily, not even glancing at the amazing sights around them. Do they not have eyes in their heads? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c... where we\u2019re going to take in two well-known landmarks: Rockefeller Center, which many of you will associate with ice-skating...\u201d</p><p>We swing round a corner \u2014 and my heart gives a swoop of excitement. Tiffany\u2019s. It\u2019s Tiffany\u2019s, right in front of me! I must just have a quick peek. I mean, this is what New York is all about. Little blue boxes, and white ribbon, and those gorgeous silver beans... I sidle up to the window and stare longingly at the beautiful display inside. Wow. That necklace is absolutely stunning. Oh God, and look at that watch, with all those little diamonds round the edge. I wonder how much something like that would\u2014</p><p>\u201cHey, everybody, wait up!\u201d rings out Christoph\u2019s voice. I look up \u2014 and they\u2019re all bloody miles ahead again. How come they walk so fast, anyway? \u201cAre you OK there, Rebecca?\u201d he calls, with a slightly forced cheeriness. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to try to keep up! We have a lot of ground to cover!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say, and scuttle toward the group. \u201cJust having a quick little look at Tiffany\u2019s.\u201d I grin at a woman next to me, expecting her to smile back. But she looks at me blankly and pulls the hood of her baggy gray sweatshirt more tightly over her head.</p> <p>\u201cAs I was saying,\u201d Christoph says as we stride off again, \u201cabove Fourteenth Street, Manhattan was designed as a grid, so that...\u201d</p><p>And for a while I really try to concentrate. But it\u2019s no good. I can\u2019t listen. I mean, come on. This is Fifth Avenue! There are women striding along in immaculate coats and sunglasses, yellow taxicabs honking at each other, two men are standing on a street corner, arguing in Italian... And everywhere I look, there are fabulous shops. There\u2019s Gucci \u2014 and that\u2019s the hugest Gap I\u2019ve ever seen in my life... and oh God, look at that window display over there! And we\u2019re just walking straight past Armani Exchange and no one\u2019s even pausing...</p><p>What is wrong with these people? Are they complete philistines?</p><p>We walk on a bit farther, and I\u2019m trying my best to catch a glimpse inside a window full of amazing-looking hats when... oh my God. Just... just look there. It\u2019s Saks Fifth Avenue. Right there, across the street. One of the most famous department stores in the world. Floors and floors of clothes and shoes and bags... And thank God, at last, Christoph is coming to his senses and stopping.</p><p>\u201cThis is one of New York\u2019s most famous landmarks,\u201d he\u2019s saying, with a gesture. \u201cMany New Yorkers regularly visit this magnificent place of worship \u2014 once a week or even more often. Some even make it here daily! We don\u2019t have time to do more than have a quick look inside \u2014 but those that are interested can always make a return trip.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it very old?\u201d asks a man with a Scandinavian accent.</p><p>\u201cThe building dates from 1879,\u201d says Christoph, \u201cand was designed by James Renwick.\u201d</p><p>Come on, I think impatiently, as someone else asks a question about the architecture. Who cares who designed it? Who cares about the stonework? It\u2019s what\u2019s inside that matters.</p><p>\u201cShall we go in?\u201d says Christoph at last.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I say joyfully, and hurry across the street toward the entrance.</p><p>It\u2019s only as my hand is actually on the door that I realize no one else is with me. Where\u2019ve they all gone? Puzzled, I look back \u2014 and the rest of the group is processing into a big stone church, outside which there\u2019s a board reading \u201cSt. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral.\u201d</p> <p>Oh.</p><p>Oh, I see. When he said \u201cmagnificent place of worship\u201d he meant...</p><p>Right. Of course.</p><p>I hesitate, hand on the door, feeling torn. I should go into the cathedral. I should take in some culture and come back to Saks later.</p><p>But then \u2014 how is that going to help me get to know whether I want to live in New York or not? Looking around some old cathedral?</p><p>Put it like this \u2014 how many millions of cathedrals do we have in England? And how many branches of Saks Fifth Avenue?</p><p>\u201cAre you going in?\u201d says an impatient voice behind me.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say, coming to a decision. \u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019m going in.\u201d</p> <p>I push my way through the heavy wooden doors and into the store, feeling almost sick with anticipation. I haven\u2019t felt this excited since Octagon relaunched their designer floor and I was invited to the cardholders\u2019 champagne reception.</p><p>I mean, visiting any shop for the first time is exciting. There\u2019s always that electric buzz as you push open the door; that hope, that belief, that this is going to be the shop of all shops, which will bring you everything you ever wanted, at magically low prices. But this is a thousand times better. A million times. Because this isn\u2019t just any old shop, is it? This is a world-famous shop. I\u2019m actually here. I\u2019m in Saks on Fifth Avenue in New York. As I walk slowly into the store \u2014 forcing myself not to rush \u2014 I feel as though I\u2019m setting off for a date with a Hollywood movie star. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wander through the perfumery, gazing around at the elegant Art Deco paneling; the high, airy ceilings; the foliage everywhere. God, this has to be one of the most beautiful shops I\u2019ve ever been in. At the back are old-fashioned lifts which make you feel you\u2019re in a film with Cary Grant, and on a little table is a pile of store directories. I pick one up, just to get my bearings... and I don\u2019t quite believe it. There are ten floors to this store.</p><p>Ten.</p><p>I stare at the list, transfixed. I feel like a child trying to choose a sweetie in a chocolate factory. Where am I going to start? How should I do this? Start at the top? Start at the bottom? All these names, jumping out at me, calling to me. Anna Sui. Calvin Klein. Kate Spade. Kiehl\u2019s. I am going to hyperventilate.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d A voice interrupts my thoughts and I turn to see a girl with a Saks name badge smiling at me. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm... yes,\u201d I say, still staring at the directory. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to work out where to start, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you interested in clothes? Or accessories? Or shoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say dazedly. \u201cBoth. All. Everything. Erm... a bag,\u201d I say randomly. \u201cI need a new bag!\u201d</p><p>Which is true. I mean, I\u2019ve brought bags with me \u2014 but you can always do with a new bag. Plus, I\u2019ve been noticing that all the women in Manhattan seem to have very smart designer bags \u2014 so this is a very good way of acclimatizing myself to the city.</p><p>The girl gives me a friendly smile.</p> <p>\u201cBags and accessories are through there,\u201d she says, pointing. \u201cYou might want to start there and work your way up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ll do. Thanks!\u201d</p><p>God, I adore shopping abroad. I mean, shopping anywhere is always great \u2014 but the advantages of doing it abroad are:</p><p>1. You can buy things you can\u2019t get in Britain.2. You can name-drop when you get back home. (\u201cActually, I picked this up in New York.\u201d)3. Foreign money doesn\u2019t count, so you can spend as much as you like.</p><p>OK, I know that last one isn\u2019t entirely true. Somewhere in my head I know that dollars are proper money, with a real value. But I mean, look at them. I just can\u2019t take them seriously. I\u2019ve got a whole wodge of them in my purse, and I feel as though I\u2019m carrying around the bank from a Monopoly set. Yesterday I went and bought some magazines from a newsstand, and as I handed over a twenty-dollar bill, it was just like playing shop. It\u2019s like some weird form of jet lag \u2014 you move into another currency and suddenly feel as though you\u2019re spending nothing.</p><p>So as I walk around the bag department, trying out gorgeous bag after gorgeous bag, I\u2019m not taking too much notice of the prices. Occasionally I lift a price tag and make a feeble attempt to work out how much that is in real money \u2014 but I have to confess, I can\u2019t remember the exact exchange rate.</p> <p>But the point is, it doesn\u2019t matter. Because this is America, and everyone knows that prices in America are really low. It\u2019s common knowledge. So basically, I\u2019m working on the principle that everything\u2019s a bargain. I mean, look at all these gorgeous designer handbags. They\u2019re probably half what they\u2019d cost in England, if not less!</p><p>As I\u2019m hovering over the DKNY display, an elderly woman wearing a gold-colored suit and carrying a Gucci tote comes up to me.</p><p>\u201cWhich one matches?\u201d she says. \u201cThis... \u201d She holds out a tan satin bag. \u201c... or this... \u201d She holds out a paler one. \u201cIt\u2019s for evening,\u201d she adds.</p><p>\u201cErm...\u201d I look at her suit and at the bags again \u2014 and wonder how to tell her they don\u2019t match at all. \u201cThe thing is, they\u2019re both a kind of brownish color... and your suit\u2019s more of a golden, yellowish...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the suit!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cThe dog!\u201d</p><p>I look at her perplexedly \u2014 then spot a tiny face poking out of the Gucci tote. Oh my God! Is that a real live dog?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hide, Muffy!\u201d says the woman, reaching into the bag and hauling it out. And honestly, it\u2019s more like a rat than a dog \u2014 except a rat with a Gucci collar and a diamante name tag.</p><p>\u201cYou want your bag to match your... dog?\u201d I say, just to be sure.</p> <p>\u201cIf I can\u2019t find anything, I\u2019ll just have to have her hair tinted again.\u201d The woman sighs. \u201cBut it\u2019s so time-consuming...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t do that!\u201d I say hastily. \u201cI think the paler bag goes perfectly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right.\u201d She gives it a critical look, then nods. \u201cThank you for your help. Do you have a dog?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cErm... not on me.\u201d</p><p>The woman stares at me suspiciously \u2014 then stuffs the dog back in the Gucci tote. She walks off, and I resume my search, wondering if I need to buy a dog in order to be a real New Yorker. Except I only like big ones. And you couldn\u2019t exactly lug a Labrador around in a Fendi clutch, could you?</p><p>Eventually I choose a beautiful Kate Spade bag in tan leather, and take it up to the counter. It costs five hundred dollars, which sounds quite a lot \u2014 but then, \u201ca million lira\u201d sounds like a lot too, doesn\u2019t it? And that\u2019s only about fifty pence. So this is sure to be a bargain.</p><p>As the assistant hands me my receipt, she even says something about it being \u201ca gift\u201d\u2014and I beam in agreement.</p> <p>\u201cA complete gift! I mean, in London, it would probably cost\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGina, are you going upstairs?\u201d interrupts the woman, turning to a colleague. \u201cGina will show you to the seventh floor,\u201d she says, and smiles at me.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, in slight confusion. \u201cWell... OK.\u201d</p><p>Gina beckons me briskly and, after a moment\u2019s hesitation, I follow her, wondering what\u2019s on the seventh floor. Maybe some complimentary lounge for Kate Spade customers, with free champagne or something!</p><p>It\u2019s only as we\u2019re approaching a department entitled \u201cGift Wrapping\u201d that I suddenly realize what\u2019s going on. When I said gift, she must have thought I meant it was an actual\u2014</p> <p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d says Gina brightly. \u201cThe Saks signature box is complimentary \u2014 or choose from a range of quality wrap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d I say. \u201cWell... thanks very much! Although actually, I wasn\u2019t really planning to\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Gina has already gone \u2014 and the two ladies behind the gift wrap counter are smiling encouragingly at me.</p><p>This is a bit embarrassing.</p><p>\u201cHave you decided which paper you\u2019d like?\u201d says the elder of the two ladies, beaming at me. \u201cWe also have a choice of ribbons and adornments.\u201d</p><p>Oh, sod it. I\u2019ll get it wrapped. I mean, it only costs $7.50\u2014and it\u2019ll be nice to have something to open when I get back to the hotel room.</p> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say, and beam back. \u201cI\u2019d like that silver paper, please, and some purple ribbon... and one of those clusters of silver berries.\u201d</p><p>The lady reaches for the paper and deftly begins to wrap up my bag \u2014 more neatly than I\u2019ve ever wrapped anything in my life. And you know, this is quite fun! Maybe I should always get my shopping gift wrapped.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s it to?\u201d says the lady, opening a card and taking out a silver pen.</p><p>\u201cUm... to Becky,\u201d I say vaguely. Three girls, all wearing jeans and high-heeled boots, have come into the gift wrap room \u2014 and I\u2019m slightly intrigued by their conversation.</p><p>\u201c... below wholesale...\u201d</p><p>\u201c... sample sale...\u201d</p><p>\u201c... Earl jeans...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who is it from?\u201d says the gift wrap lady pleasantly.</p> <p>\u201cUm... from Becky,\u201d I say without thinking. The gift wrap lady gives me a rather strange look and I suddenly realize what I\u2019ve said. \u201cA... a different Becky,\u201d I add awkwardly.</p><p>\u201c... sample sale...\u201d</p><p>\u201c... Alexander McQueen, pale blue, 80 percent off...\u201d</p><p>\u201c... sample sale...\u201d</p><p>\u201c... sample sale...\u201d</p><p>I cannot bear this any longer.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I say, turning round. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to eavesdrop on your conversation \u2014 but I just have to know one thing. What is a sample sale?\u201d</p><p>The whole gift wrap area goes quiet. Everyone is staring at me, even the lady with the silver pen.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what a sample sale is?\u201d says a girl in a leather jacket eventually, as though I\u2019ve said I don\u2019t know my alphabet.</p><p>\u201cErm... no,\u201d I say, feeling myself flush red. \u201cNo, I... I don\u2019t.\u201d The girl raises her eyebrows, reaches in her bag, rummages around, and eventually pulls out a card. \u201cHoney, this is a sample sale.\u201d</p><p>I take the card from her \u2014 and as I read, my skin starts to prickle with excitement.</p><p>SAMPLE SALE</p><p>Designer clothes, 50\u201370 % off.</p><p>Ralph Lauren, Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, Gucci.</p><p>Bags, shoes, hosiery, 40\u201360 % off.</p><p>Prada, Fendi, Lagerfeld.</p><p>\u201cIs this for real?\u201d I breathe at last, looking up. \u201cI mean, could... could I go to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d says the girl. \u201cIt\u2019s for real. But it\u2019ll only last a day.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA day?\u201d My heart starts to thump in panic. \u201cJust one day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day,\u201d affirms the girl solemnly. I glance at the other girls \u2014 and they\u2019re nodding in agreement.</p><p>\u201cSample sales come without much warning,\u201d explains one.</p><p>\u201cThey can be anywhere. They just appear overnight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen they\u2019re gone. Vanished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you just have to wait for the next one.\u201d</p><p>I look from face to face, utterly mesmerized. I feel like an explorer learning about some mysterious nomadic tribe.</p><p>\u201cSo you wanna catch this one today,\u201d says the girl in blue, tapping the card and bringing me back to life, \u201cyou\u2019d better hurry.\u201d</p><p>I have never moved as fast as I do out of that shop. Clutching my Saks Fifth Avenue carrier, I hail a taxi, breathlessly read out the address on the card, and sink back into my seat.</p> <p>I have no idea where we\u2019re heading or what famous landmarks we\u2019re passing \u2014 but I don\u2019t care. As long as there are designer clothes on sale, then that\u2019s all I need to know.</p><p>We come to a stop, and I pay the driver, making sure I tip him about 50 percent so he doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m some stingy English tourist \u2014 and, heart thumping, I get out. And I have to admit, on first impression, things are not promising. I\u2019m in a street full of rather uninspiring-looking shop fronts and office blocks. On the card it said the sample sale was at 405, but when I follow the numbers along the road, 405 turns out to be just another office building. Am I in the wrong place altogether? I walk along the pavement for a little bit, peering up at the buildings \u2014 but there are no clues. I don\u2019t even know which district I\u2019m in.</p><p>Suddenly I feel deflated and rather stupid. I was supposed to be going on a nice organized walking tour today \u2014 and what have I done instead? I\u2019ve gone rushing off to some strange part of the city, where I\u2019ll probably get mugged any minute. In fact, the whole thing was probably a scam, I think morosely. I mean, honestly. Designer clothes at 70 percent discount? I should have realized it was far too good to be\u2014</p><p>Hang on. Just... hang on a minute.</p><p>Another taxi is pulling up, and a girl in a Miu Miu dress is getting out. She consults a piece of paper, walks briskly along the pavement, and disappears inside the door of 405. A moment later, two more girls appear along the street \u2014 and as I watch, they go inside, too.</p><p>Maybe this is the right place.</p> <p>I push open the glass doors, walk into a shabby foyer, and nod nervously at the concierge sitting at the desk.</p><p>\u201cErm... excuse me,\u201d I say politely. \u201cI was looking for the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelfth floor,\u201d he says in a bored voice. \u201cElevators are in the rear.\u201d</p><p>I hurry toward the back of the foyer, summon one of the rather elderly lifts, and press twelve. Slowly and creakily the lift rises \u2014 and I begin to hear a kind of faint hubbub, rising in volume as I get nearer. The lift suddenly pings and the doors open and... Oh my God. Is this the queue?</p><p>A line of girls is snaking back from a door at the end of the corridor. Girls in cashmere coats, girls in black suits, girls tossing their springy ponytails around, and chattering excitedly into their mobile phones. There\u2019s not a single one who isn\u2019t wearing full makeup and smart shoes and carrying some sort of designer bag, even if it\u2019s the teeniest little Louis Vuitton coin purse \u2014 and the babble of conversation is peppered with names of fashion houses. They\u2019re all pressing forward, firmly moving their stilettos inch by inch along the floor, and all have the same urgent look in their eyes. Every so often somebody pushes their way out of the door, holding an enormous, nameless carrier bag \u2014 and about three girls push their way in. Then, just as I join the end of the line, there\u2019s a rattling sound, and a woman opens up a door, a few yards behind me.</p><p>\u201cAnother entrance this way,\u201d she calls. \u201cCome this way!\u201d</p><p>In front of me, a whole line of heads whips round. There\u2019s a collective intake of breath \u2014 and then it\u2019s like a tidal wave of girls, all heading toward me. I find myself running toward the door, just to avoid being knocked down \u2014 and suddenly I\u2019m in the middle of the room, slightly shaken, as everybody else peels off and heads for the racks.</p><p>I look around, trying to get my bearings. There are racks and racks of clothes, tables covered in bags and shoes and scarves. I can already spot Ralph Lauren knitwear... a rack full of fabulous coats... there\u2019s a stack of Prada bags... I mean, this is like a dream come true! Everywhere I look, girls are feverishly sorting through garments, looking for labels, trying out bags. Their manicured nails are descending on the stuff like the claws of birds of prey and I can\u2019t believe quite how fast they\u2019re working. As I see the girl who was standing in front of me in the line, I feel a surge of panic. She\u2019s got a whole armful of stuff, and I haven\u2019t even started. If I don\u2019t get in there, everything will be gone. I have to grab something now!</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I fight my way through to one of the racks and start leafing through chiffon pleated dresses. Three hundred dollars, reduced to seventy dollars! I mean, even if you only wore it once... And oh God, here are some fantastic print trousers, some label I\u2019ve never heard of, but they\u2019re reduced by 90 percent! And a leather coat... and those Prada bags. I have to get one of the Prada bags!</p><p>As I breathlessly reach for one, my hand collides with another girl\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she says at once, and snatches the bag up. \u201cI was there first!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say. \u201cErm... sorry!\u201d I quickly grab another one which, to be honest, looks exactly the same. As the girl starts examining the interior of her bag, I can\u2019t help staring at her nails. They\u2019re filed into square shapes and carefully decorated in two different shades of pink. How long did that take to do? As she looks up, I see her hair is two-tone as well \u2014 brown with aubergine tips \u2014 while her mouth is carefully lined with purple and filled in with pale mauve.</p> <p>\u201cGot a problem?\u201d she says, suddenly looking at me, and I jump.</p><p>\u201cNo! I was just wondering \u2014 where\u2019s the changing room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanging room?\u201d She chuckles. \u201cAre you kidding? No such thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I look around again, and notice a spectacular black girl, about nine feet tall, stripping off to her bra and knickers. \u201cI see. So we... change right here? Great!\u201d I swallow. \u201cNo problem at all.\u201d</p><p>Hesitantly I start unbuttoning my coat, telling myself that I\u2019ve got no alternative \u2014 and no one\u2019s watching anyway. But Two-Tone Girl\u2019s expression is changing as she gazes at me.</p> <p>\u201cAre you British?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Did you recognize my accent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love the British!\u201d Her eyes light up. \u201cThat film, Notting Hill? I loved that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right! So did I, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Welsh guy. He was hilarious!\u201d She suddenly frowns as I step out of my shoes. \u201cHey, but wait. You shouldn\u2019t have to get changed out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re British! Everyone knows the Brits are reserved. It\u2019s like... your national disease or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s fine...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d To my horror the girl strides over and pokes the woman in black standing by the door. \u201cExcuse me? This girl is British. She needs privacy to try on her things. OK?\u201d</p><p>The woman turns to stare at me as though I\u2019m a Martian and I smile nervously back.</p><p>\u201cReally, don\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t mind...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs privacy!\u201d insists the girl. \u201cThey\u2019re different than us. It\u2019s a whole other culture. Can she go behind those racks there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I don\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d says the woman, rolling her eyes. \u201cJust don\u2019t mess up the displays.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say to the girl, a little awkwardly. \u201cI\u2019m Becky, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJodie.\u201d She gives me a wide grin. \u201cLove your boots!\u201d</p><p>I disappear behind the rack and begin trying on all the clothes I\u2019ve gathered. With each one I feel a little frisson of delight \u2014 and when I get to the Prada bag, it\u2019s a surge of pure joy. Prada at 50 percent off! I mean, this would make the whole trip worthwhile, just on its own.</p><p>When I\u2019ve eventually finished, I come out from behind the rack to see Jodie wriggling into a stretchy white dress.</p><p>\u201cThis sample sale is so great!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cI\u2019m just like... where do I stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean.\u201d I give her a blissful smile. \u201cThat dress looks great, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to buy all that?\u201d she says, giving my armload an impressed look.</p><p>\u201cNot all of it.\u201d I reach into the pile. \u201cNot... these trousers. But everything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool! Go, girl.\u201d</p><p>As I happily head toward the paying table, the room is reverberating with high-pitched female voices and I can hear snippets of conversation floating around.</p><p>\u201cI have to have it,\u201d a girl is saying, holding up a coat against herself. \u201cI just have to have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, what I\u2019m going to do is, I\u2019m just going to put the $450 I spent today onto my mortgage,\u201d another girl is saying to her friend as they walk out, laden with bags. \u201cI mean, what\u2019s $450 over thirty years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne hundred percent cashmere!\u201d someone else is exclaiming. \u201cDid you see this? It\u2019s only fifty dollars!

After the sample sale, I ended up going out for a \u201cwelcome to New York\u201d coffee with Jodie. We sat at a marble table, sipping our decaf Frappuccinos and nibbling at nonfat cranberry muffins, and both worked out exactly how much money we\u2019d saved on our bargains ($1,230 in my case!). We agreed to meet up again during my visit \u2014 and then Jodie told me all about this amazing Web site that sends you information on these kind of events every day. Every day! I mean, the possibilities are limitless. You could spend your whole life going to sample sales!</p><p>You know. In theory.</p><p>I go up to our room \u2014 and as I open the door I see Luke sitting at the desk, reading through some papers.</p> <p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say breathlessly, dumping my bags on the enormous bed. \u201cListen, I need to use the laptop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d says Luke. \u201cSure.\u201d He picks up the laptop from the desk and hands it to me, and I go and sit on the bed. I open the laptop, consult the piece of paper Jodie gave me, and type in the address.</p><p>\u201cSo, how was your day?\u201d asks Luke.</p><p>\u201cIt was great!\u201d I say, tapping the keys impatiently. \u201cI made a new friend, and I saw lots of the city... Ooh, and look in that blue bag! I got you some really nice shirts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you start to get a feel for the place?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I think so. I mean, obviously it\u2019s early...\u201d I frown at the screen. \u201cCome on, already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you weren\u2019t too overwhelmed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm... not really,\u201d I say absently. Aha! Suddenly the screen is filling up with images. A row of little sweeties at the top \u2014 and logos saying, It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s fashion. In New York City. The Daily Candy home page!</p><p>I click on \u201cSubscribe\u201d and briskly start to type in my e-mail details, as Luke gets up and comes toward me, a concerned look on his face.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me, Becky,\u201d he says. \u201cI know it must all seem very strange and daunting to you. I know you couldn\u2019t possibly find your feet in just one day. But on first impressions \u2014 do you think you could get used to New York? Do you think you could ever see yourself living here?\u201d</p><p>I type the last letter with a flourish, press \u201cSend,\u201d and look at him thoughtfully.</p> <p>\u201cYou know what? I think I probably could.\u201d</p><p>HOWSKI AND FORLANO</p><p>U.S. Immigration Lawyers</p><p>568 E. 56th Street</p><p>New York, N.Y. 10016</p><p>Ms. Rebecca Bloomwood</p><p>Flat 2</p><p>4 Burney Rd.</p> <p>London SW6 8FD</p><p>UNITED KINGDOM</p><p>September 28, 2000</p><p>Dear Ms. Bloomwood:</p><p>Thank you for your completed U.S. immigration forms.

I\u2019ve walked so many blocks my feet ache, and I\u2019ve really seen some awe-inspiring things. Like, in Bloomingdale\u2019s, they have a chocolate factory! And there\u2019s a whole district full of nothing but shoe shops!</p><p>I keep trying to get Luke along to look at all these amazing sights \u2014 but he just has meeting after meeting. He\u2019s seeing about twenty people a day \u2014 wooing potential clients and networking with media people, and even looking round office spaces in the financial district. As he said yesterday at breakfast, he needs to hit the ground running when he arrives. I was about to make a little joke about \u201cBreak a leg!\u201d... but then I decided against it. Luke\u2019s taking everything a bit seriously at the moment.</p><p>As well as setting up the new company, he\u2019s had briefings from Alicia in London every morning \u2014 and she keeps sending through faxes for him to approve, and needlessly long e-mails. I just know she\u2019s only doing it all to show off to Luke \u2014 and the really annoying thing is, it\u2019s working. Like, a couple of clients rang up to complain about things, but when he called Alicia she had already leapt into action and sorted it out. So then I had to hear for fifteen minutes about how marvelous she is, and what a great job she\u2019s doing \u2014 and keep nodding my head as though I completely agreed. But I still can\u2019t stand her. She rang up the other morning when Luke was out, and when I picked up, she said \u201cSo sorry to disturb your beauty sleep!\u201d in this really patronizing way, and rang off before I could think of a good reply. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Still, never mind. On the positive side, Luke and I did manage to get our walk in Central Park \u2014 even if it was only for five minutes. And one afternoon, Luke took me on the Staten Island Ferry, which was fantastic \u2014 except for the moment when I lost my new baseball cap overboard.</p><p>Obviously, I didn\u2019t mean to shriek so loudly. Nor did I mean for that old woman to mishear and think I\u2019d lost my \u201ccat\u201d\u2014and I certainly didn\u2019t want her to insist the boat should be stopped. It caused a bit of a kerfuffle, actually, which was rather embarrassing. Still, never mind \u2014 as Luke said, at least all those tourists with their video cameras had something to film.</p><p>But now it\u2019s Wednesday morning. The holiday is over \u2014 and I\u2019ve got a slight dentisty feeling of dread. It\u2019s my first appointment today with a pair of important TV people from HLBC. I\u2019m actually quite scared.</p><p>Luke\u2019s left early for a breakfast meeting with Michael and some top PR headhunter who\u2019s going to supply him with staff, so I\u2019m left alone in bed, sipping coffee and nibbling at a croissant, and telling myself not to get nervous. The key is not to panic, but to stay calm and cool. As Luke kept reassuring me, this meeting is not an interview as such, it\u2019s simply a first-stage introduction. A \u201cgetting-to-know-you\u201d lunch, he called it.</p> <p>But in a way, lunch is even more scary than an interview. What if I knock something over? What if I don\u2019t tip all the right people? What if I can\u2019t think of anything to say and we sit there in an embarrassing silence?</p><p>I spend all morning in our room, trying to read the Wall Street Journal and watching CNN \u2014 but that only freaks me out even more. I mean, these American television presenters are so slick and immaculate. They never fluff their words, and they never make jokes, and they know everything. Like who\u2019s the trade secretary of Iraq, and the implications of global warming for Peru. And here I am, thinking I can do what they do.</p><p>My other problem is, I haven\u2019t done a proper interview for years. Morning Coffee never bothered to interview me, I just kind of fell into it. And for my old job on Successful Saving, I just had a cozy chat with Philip, the editor, who already knew me from press conferences. So the idea of having to impress a pair of complete strangers from scratch is completely terrifying.</p><p>\u201cJust be yourself,\u201d Luke kept saying. But frankly, that\u2019s a ridiculous idea. Everyone knows, the point of an interview is not to demonstrate who you are, but to pretend to be whatever sort of person they want for the job. That\u2019s why they call it \u201cinterview technique.\u201d</p><p>My interview outfit consists of a beautiful black suit I got at Whistles, with quite a short skirt and discreet red stitching. I\u2019ve teamed it with high-heeled court shoes and some very sheer, very expensive tights. (Or \u201chose\u201d as I must now start calling them. But honestly. It sounds like Shakespeare or something.) As I arrive at the restaurant where we\u2019re meeting, I see my reflection in a glass door \u2014 and I\u2019m quite impressed. But at the same time, half of me wants to run away, give up on the idea, and buy myself a nice pair of shoes to commiserate.</p> <p>I can\u2019t, though. I have to go through with this. The reason my stomach feels so hollow and my hands feel so damp is that this really matters to me. I can\u2019t tell myself I don\u2019t care and it\u2019s not important, like I do about most things. Because this really does matter. If I don\u2019t manage to get a job in New York, then I won\u2019t be able to live here. If I screw this interview up, and word gets around that I\u2019m hopeless \u2014 then it\u2019s all over. Oh God. Oh God...</p><p>OK, calm down, I tell myself firmly. I can do this. I can do it. And afterward, I\u2019m going to reward myself with a little treat. The Daily Candy Web site e-mailed me this morning, and apparently this huge makeup emporium in SoHo called Sephora is running a special promotion today, until four. Every customer gets a goody bag \u2014 and if you spend fifty dollars, you get a free special engraved beauty box! I mean, how cool would that be?</p><p>About two seconds after the e-mail arrived, I got one from Jodie, the girl I met at the sample sale. I\u2019d been telling her I was a bit nervous about meeting Luke\u2019s mother \u2014 and she said I should get a makeover for the occasion and Sephora was definitely the place, did I want to meet up? So that will be fun, at least...</p><p>There, you see, I feel better already, just thinking about it. OK, go girl. Go get \u2019em.</p><p>I force myself to push open the door, and suddenly I\u2019m in a very smart restaurant, all black lacquer and white linen and colored fish swimming in tanks.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d says a ma\u00eetre d\u2019 dressed entirely in black.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHello,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m here to meet\u2014\u201d</p><p>Shit, I\u2019ve completely forgotten the names of the people I\u2019m meeting.</p><p>Oh, great start, Becky. This is really professional.</p><p>\u201cCould you just... hang on?\u201d I say, and turn away, flushing red. I scrabble in my bag for the piece of paper \u2014 and here we are. Judd Westbrook and Kent Garland.</p> <p>Kent? Is that really a name?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Rebecca Bloomwood,\u201d I say to the ma\u00eetre d\u2019, hastily shoving the paper back in my bag, \u201cmeeting Judd Westbrook and Kent Garland of HLBC.\u201d</p><p>He scans the list, then gives a frosty smile. \u201cAh yes. They\u2019re already here.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I follow him to the table \u2014 and there they are. A blond woman in a beige trouser suit and a chiseled-looking man in an equally immaculate black suit and sage-green tie. I fight the urge to run away, and advance with a confident smile, holding out my hand. They both look up at me, and for a moment neither says anything \u2014 and I feel a horrible conviction that I\u2019ve already broken some vital rule of etiquette. I mean, you do shake hands in America, don\u2019t you? Are you supposed to kiss? Or bow?</p><p>But thankfully the blond woman is getting up and clasping my hand warmly.</p> <p>\u201cBecky!\u201d she says. \u201cSo thrilled to meet you. I\u2019m Kent Garland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJudd Westbrook,\u201d says the man, gazing at me with deep-set eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re very excited to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too!\u201d I say. \u201cAnd thank you so much for your lovely flowers!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d says Judd, and ushers me into a chair. \u201cIt\u2019s a delight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn enormous pleasure,\u201d says Kent.</p><p>There\u2019s an expectant silence.</p> <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a... a fantastic pleasure for me, too,\u201d I say hastily. \u201cAbsolutely... phenomenal.\u201d</p><p>So far so good. If we just keep telling each other what a pleasure this is, I should do OK. Carefully I place my bag on the floor, along with my copies of the FT and the Wall Street Journal. I thought about the South China Morning Post, too, but decided that might be a bit much.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a drink?\u201d says a waiter, appearing at my side.</p><p>\u201cOh yes!\u201d I say, and glance nervously around at the table to see what everyone else is having. Kent and Judd have both got tumblers full of what looks like G&amp;T, so I\u2019d better follow suit. \u201cA gin and tonic, please.\u201d</p><p>To be honest, I think I need it, just to relax. As I open my menu, both Judd and Kent are gazing at me with an alert interest, as though they think I might suddenly burst into blossom or something.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen your tapes,\u201d says Kent, leaning forward. \u201cAnd we\u2019re very impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say \u2014 and then realize I shouldn\u2019t sound quite so astonished. \u201cReally,\u201d I repeat, trying to sound nonchalant. \u201cYes, well, I\u2019m proud of the show, obviously...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you know, Rebecca, we produce a show called Consumer Today,\u201d says Kent. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a personal finance segment at present, but we\u2019d love to bring in the kind of advisory slot you\u2019re doing in Britain.\u201d She glances at Judd, who nods in agreement.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious you have a passion for personal finance,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, taken aback. \u201cWell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt shines through your work,\u201d he asserts firmly. \u201cAs does the pincerlike grip you have on your subject.\u201d</p><p>Pincerlike grip?</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re pretty unique, Rebecca,\u201d Kent is saying. \u201cA young, approachable, charming girl, with such a high level of expertise and conviction in what you\u2019re saying...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an inspiration for the financially challenged everywhere,\u201d agrees Judd.</p><p>\u201cWhat we admire the most is the patience you show these people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe empathy you have with them...\u201d</p><p>\u201c... that faux-simplistic style of yours!\u201d says Kent, and looks at me intently. \u201cHow do you keep that up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm... you know! It just... comes, I suppose...\u201d The waiter puts a drink in front of me and I grab it thankfully. \u201cWell, cheers, everyone!\u201d I say, lifting my glass.</p><p>\u201cCheers!\u201d says Kent. \u201cAre you ready to order, Rebecca?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I reply, quickly scanning the menu. \u201cThe ahm... sea bass, please, and a green salad.\u201d I look at the others. \u201cAnd shall we share some garlic bread?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wheat-free,\u201d says Judd politely.</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d I say. \u201cWell...

Of course Manhattanites don\u2019t eat garlic bread.</p><p>\u201cAnd to drink?\u201d says the waiter.</p> <p>\u201cErm...\u201d I look around the table. \u201cI don\u2019t know. A sauvignon blanc, maybe? What does everyone else want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d says Kent with a friendly smile, and I breathe a sigh of relief. \u201cJust some more Pellegrino for me,\u201d she adds, and gestures to her tumbler.</p><p>\u201cAnd me,\u201d says Judd.</p><p>Pellegrino? They\u2019re on Pellegrino?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just have water too!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t need wine! It was just an idea. You know\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d says Kent. \u201cYou must have whatever you like!\u201d She smiles at the waiter. \u201cA bottle of the sauvignon blanc, please, for our guest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly\u2014\u201d I say, flushing red.</p><p>\u201cRebecca,\u201d says Kent, lifting a hand with a smile. \u201cWhatever makes you comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Oh great. Now she thinks I\u2019m a complete alcoholic. She thinks I can\u2019t survive one getting-to-know-you lunch without hitting the booze.</p><p>Well, never mind. It\u2019s done now. And it\u2019ll be OK. I\u2019ll just drink one glass. One glass, and that\u2019s it.</p><p>And that is honestly what I mean to do. Drink one glass and leave it at that.</p> <p>But the trouble is, every time I finish my glass, a waiter comes along and fills it up again, and somehow I find myself drinking it. Besides which, it would look rather ungrateful to order a whole bottle of wine and leave it undrunk.</p><p>So the upshot is, by the time we\u2019ve finished our food, I\u2019m feeling quite... Well. I suppose one word might be drunk. Another might be pissed. But it\u2019s not a problem, because we\u2019re having a really good time, and I\u2019m actually being really witty. Probably because I\u2019ve relaxed a little. I\u2019ve told them lots of funny stories about behind the scenes at Morning Coffee, and they\u2019ve listened carefully and said it all sounds \u201cquite fascinating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, you British are very different from us,\u201d says Kent thoughtfully, as I finish telling her about the time Dave the cameraman arrived so pissed he keeled over in the middle of a shot, and got Emma picking her nose. God, that was funny. In fact, I can\u2019t stop giggling, just remembering it.</p><p>\u201cWe just love your British sense of humor,\u201d says Judd, and stares intently at me as though expecting a joke.</p><p>OK, quick. Think of something funny. British sense of humor. Erm... Fawlty Towers? Ab Fab?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention the war!\u201d I hear myself exclaiming. \u201cSweetie darling.\u201d I give a snort of laughter, and Judd and Kent exchange puzzled looks.</p><p>Just then, the coffee arrives. At least, I\u2019m having coffee, Kent\u2019s having English breakfast tea, and Judd\u2019s having some weird herbal thing which he gave to the waiter to make.</p><p>\u201cI adore tea,\u201d says Kent, giving me a smile. \u201cSo calming. Now, Rebecca. In England, the custom is that you turn the pot three times clockwise to keep away the devil. Is that right? Or is it counterclockwise?\u201d</p> <p>Turn the pot? I\u2019ve never heard of turning the bloody pot.</p><p>\u201cErm... let me remember.\u201d</p><p>I screw my face up thoughtfully, trying to remember the last time I drank tea from a teapot. But the only image that comes to me is of Suze dunking a teabag in a mug while she tears a KitKat open with her teeth.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s counterclockwise,\u201d I say at last. \u201cBecause of the old saying, \u2018The devil he creeps around the clock... but never backward he will go.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>What the hell am I talking about? Why have I suddenly put on a Scottish accent?</p><p>\u201cFascinating!\u201d says Kent, taking a sip of tea. \u201cI adore all these quaint old British customs. Do you know any others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I say brightly. \u201cI know loads!\u201d</p><p>Stop it, Becky. Just stop now.</p><p>\u201cLike, we have a very old custom of... of... \u2018turning the tea cake.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d says Kent. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d I say confidently. \u201cWhat happens is, you take your tea cake...\u201d I grab a bread roll from a passing waiter. \u201cAnd you... rotate it above your head like so... and you... you say a little rhyme...\u201d</p><p>Crumbs are starting to fall on my head, and I can\u2019t think of anything to rhyme with tea cake, so I put my bread roll down and take a sip of coffee. \u201cThey do it in Cornwall,\u201d I add. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d says Judd with interest. \u201cMy grandmother comes from Cornwall.

It has to be!</p><p>\u201c... the Association of Financiers Annual Conference!\u201d she finishes proudly.</p><p>For a few moments I can\u2019t speak.</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say at last, my voice slightly more high-pitched than usual. \u201cYou\u2019re... you\u2019re joking!\u201d</p><p>How on earth am I going to get out of this one?</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d says Kent delightedly. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be pleased. So if you\u2019re not doing anything else this afternoon...\u201d</p><p>I am doing something! I want to wail. I\u2019m going to Sephora to get made over!</p><p>\u201cThere are some very high-profile speakers,\u201d puts in Judd. \u201cBert Frankel, for one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say. \u201cBert Frankel!\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve never heard of bloody Bert Frankel.</p><p>\u201cSo... I have the pass right here...\u201d says Kent, reaching for her bag.</p><p>Quick. I have to say something or I\u2019ll find myself spending a precious afternoon in New York sitting in some dreary conference hall.</p><p>\u201cWhat a shame!\u201d I hear myself exclaiming. \u201cBecause actually...\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t tell them I have to go and try on lipstick.</p><p>\u201cActually... I was planning to visit the Guggenheim this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Phew. No one can argue with culture.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d says Kent, looking disappointed. \u201cCouldn\u2019t it wait until another day?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d I say. \u201cThere\u2019s a particular exhibit I\u2019ve been absolutely longing to see since... since I was a child of six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d says Kent, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I lean forward earnestly. \u201cEver since I saw a photograph of it in my granny\u2019s art book, it\u2019s been my ambition since childhood to come to New York City and see this piece of art. And now that I\u2019m here... I just can\u2019t wait any longer. I hope you understand...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d says Kent. \u201cOf course we do! What an inspiring story!\u201d She exchanges impressed looks with Judd, and I smile modestly back. \u201cSo \u2014 which piece of art is it?\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, still smiling. OK, quick, think. The Guggenheim. Modern paintings? Sculpture?</p><p>I\u2019m fifty-fifty on modern paintings. If only I could phone a friend.</p><p>\u201cActually... I\u2019d rather not say,\u201d I say at last. \u201cI consider artistic preference a very... private matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d says Kent, looking a little taken aback. \u201cWell, of course, I didn\u2019t mean to intrude in any way\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKent,\u201d says Judd, glancing at his watch again. \u201cWe really have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d says Kent. She takes another sip of tea, and stands up. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Rebecca, we have a meeting at two thirty. But it\u2019s been such a pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d I say. \u201cNo problem!\u201d</p><p>I struggle to my feet and follow them out of the restaurant. As I pass the wine bucket I realize with a slight lurch that I\u2019ve more or less drunk the whole bottle. How embarrassing. But I don\u2019t think anybody noticed.</p><p>We arrive outside the restaurant, and Judd has already hailed a taxi for me.</p><p>\u201cGreat to meet you, Rebecca,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll report back to our vice-president of production, and we\u2019ll... be in touch! Enjoy the Guggenheim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I say, shaking hands with each of them. \u201cI will. And thank you so much!\u201d</p><p>I get into the taxi and slam the door behind me.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say to the taxi driver, watching as Judd and Kent walk away. \u201cI\u2019d like to go to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Guggenheim,\u201d chips in the driver. \u201cI heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually, I\u2019d like to go to SoHo. Sephora on Broadway.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The driver swivels in his seat to look at me. He\u2019s huge and swarthy, and his face is creased in a frown.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Guggenheim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm... I\u2019ll go later on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater on?\u201d says the driver. \u201cYou can\u2019t rush the Guggenheim. The Guggenheim is a very fine museum. Picasso. Kandinsky. You don\u2019t want to miss it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t miss it! Honestly, I promise. If we could just go to Sephora now? Please?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a disapproving silence from the front.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he says at last, and starts the engine.</p><p>As we drive off, I sink happily into my seat. I think lunch went really well, actually. Except maybe when I told them the anecdote about Rory and the guide dog. And when I tripped over on my way to the loos. But then, that could happen to anybody. The truth is, I really am settling into New York. It\u2019s only been three days, but I\u2019m getting the language and everything. Like, yesterday, I said \u201cGo figure\u201d without even thinking. And I called a skirt cute!</p><p>We pull up at a pedestrian crossing and I\u2019m peering interestedly out, wondering which street we\u2019re at \u2014 when suddenly I freeze in horror.</p> <p>There are Judd and Kent. Right there, in front of us. They\u2019re crossing the road, and Kent is saying something animatedly, and Judd is nodding. Oh God. I can\u2019t let them see me heading in the wrong direction. Quick, hide.</p><p>My heart thumping, I sink down off my seat and kind of crouch on the floor, trying to hide behind my Wall Street Journal. God, why isn\u2019t there more space in these taxis?</p><p>\u201cYou OK back there?\u201d says the taxi driver.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I gulp. I raise my head cautiously \u2014 and thank goodness Judd and Kent have disappeared. As I scramble back up onto the seat, I bump my head on the window.</p><p>\u201cHey there!\u201d says a disembodied voice, making me jump with fright. \u201cYou be careful! Safety counts, OK? So buckle up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say humbly. \u201cSorry about that. I\u2019m really sorry. I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p> <p>I fasten my seat belt with clumsy fingers, and catch the eye of the driver in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a recorded announcement,\u201d he says scornfully. \u201cYou\u2019re talking to a tape machine.\u201d</p><p>I knew that.</p><p>We arrive at Sephora on Broadway, and I thrust wodges of dollars at the driver. As I get out of the cab, he looks closely at me.</p><p>\u201cHave you been drinking, lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say indignantly. \u201cI mean... yes. But it was just a bit of wine at lunch...\u201d</p><p>The taxi driver shakes his head and drives off, and I head unsteadily into Sephora. To be honest, I am feeling a little giddy. I push open the door and... wow. Spotlights are dancing about the bright interior, landing on shiny black counters; on the deep-red carpet underfoot; on the glass packaging of a thousand nail polishes. There\u2019s music pounding, and girls milling everywhere, and trendy guys in black polo necks and headsets handing out goody bags. As I turn dazedly around, I\u2019ve never seen so much makeup in my life. Rows and rows of lipsticks. Rows and rows of eye shadows. In all the colors of the rainbow. And oh look, there are little chairs where you can sit and try it all on, with personal mirrors. This place is... I mean, it\u2019s heaven.</p><p>\u201cHi, Becky, you made it!\u201d I look up to see Jodie waving across a display of hairbrushes. She\u2019s wearing a stripy red-and-white jersey dress today, and as she gets nearer I see that her nails have been revarnished stripy red-and-white to match. \u201cReady for your makeover?\u201d</p> <p>She ushers me to one of the little chairs and I get into it, feeling a pleasant anticipation. A girl in black comes over with a friendly smile and introduces herself as Mona, my makeup specialist for today.</p><p>\u201cHad you thought what look you were after?\u201d she says as she switches on a spotlight and guides it toward my face.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s for lunch with my boyfriend\u2019s mother,\u201d I explain. \u201cI want to look kind of... groomed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPolished but subtle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have you,\u201d says Mona, nodding. \u201cTaupes and beiges. The hardest look to pull off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaupe?\u201d says Jodie, wrinkling her brow. \u201cDid anyone ever look good in taupe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe a soft color on the lips,\u201d says Mona, ignoring Jodie. \u201cLet me start with a light base...\u201d</p><p>She reaches for a cosmetic sponge and smooths color gently over my face. As she starts shading my eyes I see Jodie standing back, a critical look on her face.</p><p>\u201cFor this elegant look, less is more,\u201d says Mona.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, nodding knowledgeably. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll just fetch a mascara...\u201d</p><p>She disappears toward the front of the shop and I close my eyes. If I\u2019m honest, my head\u2019s still spinning from all that wine, and I\u2019m finding it quite hard to balance on this tiny chair.</p><p>Suddenly I feel a coldness on my cheek, and look up. Jodie is standing in front of me, dipping her fingers into a small pot.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I say feebly.</p> <p>\u201cJazzing you up a bit!\u201d she says, and dabs my other cheek. \u201cAll this neutral crap! Like that\u2019s what you wanted from a makeover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re too polite to complain. You Brits really need to get some attitude.\u201d She stands back and gives a satisfied nod. \u201cNow, did you ever wear false eyelashes? Because they have a great range here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJodie, I\u2019m not sure...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d We both look up to see Mona approaching, an affronted expression on her face. \u201cWhat the hell is going on? What\u2019s happened to her face?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe looked boring,\u201d says Jodie defiantly.</p><p>\u201cShe looked classic!\u201d Mona sticks her hands on her hips. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve ruined it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have I got on my face?\u201d I demand, and pull the mirror toward me. My own face stares back. Smooth and beige, with softly shadowed eyes, discreetly colored lips... and silver sparkles on my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cLooks great, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d says Jodie unapologetically. \u201cMuch better with the glitter.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Mona\u2019s annoyed face and suddenly feel a bit guilty.</p><p>\u201cActually, Mona,\u201d I say quickly, \u201cI\u2019d really like to buy some of the products you used. In fact... all of them. Would that be possible?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d says Mona, unbending a little. \u201cWell \u2014 yes, of course. They are from a rather expensive line...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d I turn hastily to Jodie. \u201cAnd... I\u2019ll buy the glitter too. I\u2019ll buy it all!\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later I find myself outside Sephora, clutching two carrier bags full of makeup, a whole set of new cosmetic brushes, a silver shower cap, and something called \u201cbuffing paste,\u201d which I threw in at the last moment. I\u2019m not sure quite what it is \u2014 but the jar is absolutely gorgeous!</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say, looking dazedly around the busy street in front of me. \u201cWhere next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe, I have to go,\u201d says Jodie, looking up from her pager. \u201cI\u2019ve already had a five-hour lunch break. But if you want the true SoHo experience, there\u2019s Dean and Deluca right in front of you...\u201d She swivels me by the shoulders until I\u2019m facing across the street. \u201c... and just along is Scoop, which is the place to pick up the most expensive T-shirt in the universe...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about that?\u201d I say, pointing to a gorgeous, glowing shop window that has caught my eye.</p><p>\u201cKate\u2019s Paperie. To die for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it sell?\u201d I say puzzledly. \u201cJust paper?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust paper!\u201d She gives a raucous chuckle. \u201cYou go take a look. And listen, you want to get together again sometime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to!\u201d I say in delight. \u201cI\u2019ll be here for at least another week. Thanks, Jodie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>I watch as Jodie hurries off toward the subway and suddenly notice that the spiky heels of her shoes are painted in red-and-white stripes, too. That\u2019s so cool! Where did she get them?</p><p>\u201cJodie!\u201d I cry, but she can\u2019t hear me. Never mind, I\u2019ll ask her next time.</p><p>As she disappears down into the subway station I walk slowly toward Kate\u2019s Paperie. I\u2019m not really interested in paper, to be honest. In fact, I probably won\u2019t bother going in. But it can\u2019t hurt to have a little\u2014</p><p>I stop in my tracks as I reach the window, and stare at the display, astounded. When Jodie said paper, I imagined piles of photocopying sheets. I had no idea she meant... I mean, just look at that display of marbled wrapping paper. And that decoupage box. And that amazing beaded ribbon! I\u2019ve never seen anything like it!</p><p>I push the door open and walk around, marveling at the arrangements of beautiful wrapping paper adorned with dried flowers, raffia, and bows, the photograph albums, the boxes of exquisite writing paper... And oh God, just look at the greeting cards!</p><p>You see, this is it. This is why New York is so great. They don\u2019t just have boring old cards saying Happy Birthday. They have handmade creations with twinkly flowers and witty collages, saying things like \u201cCongratulations on adopting twins!\u201d and \u201cSo sad to hear you broke up!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I walk up and down, utterly dazzled by the array. I just have to have some of these cards. Like this fantastic pop-up castle, with the flag reading \u201cI love your remodeled home!\u201d I mean, I don\u2019t actually know anyone who\u2019s remodeling their home, but I can always keep it until Mum decides to repaper the hall. And this one covered in fake grass, saying \u201cTo a smashing tennis coach with thanks.\u201d Because I\u2019m planning to have some tennis lessons next summer, and I\u2019ll want to thank my coach, won\u2019t I?</p><p>I scoop up a few more, and then move on to the invitation rack. And they\u2019re even better! Instead of just saying \u201cParty\u201d they say things like \u201cWe\u2019re Meeting at the Club for Brunch!\u201d and \u201cCome Join Us for an Informal Pizza!\u201d</p><p>You know, I think I should buy some of those. It would be shortsighted not to. Suze and I might easily hold a pizza party, mightn\u2019t we? And we\u2019ll never find invitations like this in Britain. And they\u2019re so sweet, with glittery little pizza slices all the way down the sides! I carefully put five boxes of invitations in my basket, along with all my lovely cards, and a few sheets of candy-striped wrapping paper, which I just can\u2019t resist, then head to the checkout. As the assistant scans everything through, I look around the shop again, wondering if I\u2019ve missed anything \u2014 and it\u2019s only when she announces the total that I look up in slight shock. That much? Just for a few cards?</p><p>For a moment I wonder whether I really do need them all. Like the card saying \u201cHappy Hanukkah, Boss!\u201d</p> <p>But then \u2014 they\u2019re bound to come in useful one day, aren\u2019t they? And if I\u2019m going to live in New York, I\u2019m going to have to get used to sending expensive cards all the time, so really, this is a form of acclimatization.</p><p>As I head toward the door, I\u2019m dimly aware of a ringing, burbling sort of sound \u2014 and all of a sudden I realize it\u2019s my own mobile phone.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say, clutching it to my ear. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi. It\u2019s me,\u201d says Luke. \u201cI heard your lunch went well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say, feeling a jolt of surprise. \u201cWhere did you hear that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve just been speaking to some people at HLBC. Apparently you were quite a hit. Very entertaining, they said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow! Really? Are you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite sure. They were saying how charming you were, and how cultured... I even hear they put you in a taxi to the Guggenheim afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d I say, reaching to look at a paper knife. \u201cThey did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I was quite intrigued to hear all about your burning childhood dream,\u201d says Luke. \u201cKent was very impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say vaguely. \u201cWell, that\u2019s good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Luke pauses. \u201cSlightly strange that you didn\u2019t mention the Guggenheim this morning, though, isn\u2019t it? Or indeed... ever. Bearing in mind you\u2019ve been longing to go there since you were a child of six.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I hear the amusement in his voice, and snap to attention. He\u2019s bloody well rung up to tease me, hasn\u2019t he?</p><p>\u201cHave I never mentioned the Guggenheim?\u201d I say innocently, and put the paper knife back. \u201cHow very odd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d says Luke. \u201cMost peculiar. So, are you there now?\u201d</p><p>Bugger.</p><p>For a moment, I\u2019m silenced. I simply can\u2019t admit to Luke that I\u2019ve gone shopping again. Not after all that teasing he gave me about my so-called guided tour. I mean OK, I know ten minutes out of a three-hour city tour isn\u2019t that much \u2014 but I got as far as Saks, didn\u2019t I?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say defiantly. \u201cYes, I am, actually.\u201d</p><p>Which is kind of almost true. I mean, I can easily go there after I\u2019ve finished here.</p> <p>\u201cGreat!\u201d says Luke. \u201cWhat particular exhibit are you looking at?\u201d</p><p>Oh, shut up.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I say, suddenly raising my voice. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t realize! Luke, I have to turn my mobile off. The... um... curator is complaining. But I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix at the Royalton Bar,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can meet my new associate, Michael. And I\u2019ll look forward to hearing all about your afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Now I feel a bit guilty. I shouldn\u2019t have told Luke I was at the Guggenheim. I should have told the truth.</p><p>But it doesn\u2019t matter... because what I\u2019ll do is I\u2019ll go there right now. Right this minute! After all, I can always come back to SoHo another day, can\u2019t I?</p><p>I walk slowly along the crowded street, telling myself that what I\u2019ll do is hail a cab and go straight up there. Without delay. Straight to the Guggenheim and immerse myself in some wonderful culture. Excellent. I can\u2019t wait, actually. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I arrive at a street corner and come to a standstill. A lit-up taxi crawls past \u2014 but for some strange reason my arm doesn\u2019t rise. Across the street is a stall selling fake designer sunglasses, and I feel a sudden pang of longing to go and rifle through them. And look there, that shop\u2019s doing a discount on Calvin Klein jeans. And I do actually need some new jeans... And I haven\u2019t even been into Dean and Deluca...</p><p>Oh, why couldn\u2019t the Guggenheim be in SoHo?</p><p>Hang on a minute.</p><p>People are pushing past me but I don\u2019t move. My eye is riveted by something fixed to the facade above an entrance. I don\u2019t quite believe what I\u2019m seeing.</p> <p>The word GUGGENHEIM stares back at me, as large as life. It\u2019s like God heard my prayers.</p><p>But what\u2019s going on? Has the Guggenheim suddenly moved? Are there two Guggenheims?</p><p>As I hurry toward the doors, I realize this place looks quite small for a museum \u2014 so maybe it\u2019s not the main Guggenheim. Maybe it\u2019s some trendy SoHo offshoot! Yes! I mean, if London can have the Tate Gallery and Tate Modern, why can\u2019t New York have the Guggenheim and Guggenheim SoHo? That sounds so cool!</p><p>I cautiously push the door open \u2014 and sure enough, it\u2019s all white and spacious, with modern art on pedestals and people wandering around quietly, whispering to one another.</p><p>You know, this is what all museums should be like. Nice and small, for a start, so you don\u2019t feel exhausted as soon as you walk in. I mean, you could probably do this lot in about half an hour. Plus, all the things look really interesting. Like, look at those amazing red cubes in that glass cabinet! And this fantastic abstract print, hanging on the wall.</p> <p>As I\u2019m gazing admiringly at the print, a couple come over and look at it too, and start murmuring to each other about how nice it is. Then the girl says casually, \u201cHow much is it?\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m about to turn to her with a friendly smile and say, \u201cThat\u2019s what I always want to know, too!\u201d\u2014when to my astonishment the man reaches for it and turns it over. And there\u2019s a price label fixed onto the back!</p><p>A price label in a museum! I don\u2019t believe it! This place is perfect! Finally, some forward-thinking person has agreed with me \u2014 that people don\u2019t want to just look at art, they want to know how much it is. I\u2019m going to write to the people at the Victoria and Albert about this.</p><p>And you know, now that I look around properly, all the exhibits seem to have a price on them. Those red cubes in the cabinet have got a price label, and so has that chair, and so has that... that box of pencils.</p><p>How weird, having a box of pencils in a museum. Still, maybe it\u2019s installation art. I walk over to have a closer look \u2014 and there\u2019s something printed on each pencil. Probably some really meaningful message about art, or life... I lean close, interested, and find myself reading the words \u201cGuggenheim Museum Store.\u201d</p><p>What?</p> <p>Is this a\u2014</p><p>I lift my head and look around bewilderedly.</p><p>Am I in a shop?</p><p>Suddenly I start noticing things I hadn\u2019t seen before. Like a pair of cash registers on the other side of the room. And there\u2019s somebody walking out with a couple of carrier bags.</p><p>How could I have not recognized a shop? But... this makes less and less sense. Is it just a shop on its own?</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I say, to a fair-haired boy wearing a name badge. \u201cCan I just check \u2014 this is a shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d says the boy politely. \u201cThis is the Guggenheim Museum Store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where\u2019s the actual Guggenheim Museum? With all the Picassos and things?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo see the Picassos you have to go to the main museum, on Fifth Avenue at Eighty-ninth Street,\u201d says the boy.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I look at him confusedly. \u201cSo let me just get this straight. You can come here and buy loads of stuff \u2014 and no one minds whether you\u2019ve been to the museum or not? I mean, you don\u2019t have to show your ticket or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you... you can just shop?\u201d My voice rises in delight. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect!\u201d Suddenly I see the boy\u2019s shocked expression and quickly add, \u201cI mean, obviously I do want to look at the art. Very much so. I was just... you know. Checking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re interested in visiting the museum,\u201d says the boy, \u201cI can give you a location map. Did you want to pay a visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm...\u201d</p><p>Now, let\u2019s not make any hasty decisions.</p><p>\u201cErm... I\u2019m not sure,\u201d I say carefully. \u201cCould you just give me a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d says the boy, giving me a slightly odd look, and I sit down on a white seat, thinking hard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>OK, here\u2019s the thing. I mean, obviously I could get in a cab, and whiz up to wherever it is, and spend all afternoon looking at the Picassos.</p><p>Or else... I could just buy a book about the Picassos. Because the thing is, do you actually need to see a piece of art in the flesh to appreciate it? Of course you don\u2019t. And in a way, flicking through a book would be better than trekking round lots of galleries \u2014 because I\u2019m bound to cover more ground more quickly and actually learn far more.</p><p>Besides, what they have in this shop is art, isn\u2019t it? I mean, I\u2019ve already taken in some pretty good culture. Exactly.</p><p>Several hours later, I arrive at the Royalton with a huge, exhilarated grin on my face. I haven\u2019t had such a successful afternoon shopping since... well, since yesterday.</p> <p>I check all my carrier bags in at the cloakroom, then head for the small circular bar where Luke has told me to meet him and his new associate, Michael Ellis.</p><p>I\u2019ve heard quite a lot about this Michael Ellis during the last few days. Apparently he owns a huge advertising agency in Washington and is best friends with the president. Or is it the vice-president? Something like that, anyway. Basically, he\u2019s a big shot, and crucial to Luke\u2019s new deal. So I\u2019d better make sure I impress him.</p><p>God, this place is trendy, I think as I walk in. All leather and chrome and people in severe black outfits with haircuts to match. I walk into the dim circular bar, and there\u2019s Luke, sitting at a table. To my surprise, he\u2019s on his own.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say, and kiss him. \u201cSo \u2014 where\u2019s your friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking a call,\u201d says Luke. He gestures to a waiter. \u201cAnother gimlet here, please.\u201d He gives me a quizzical look as I sit down. \u201cSo, my darling. How was the Guggenheim?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was good,\u201d I say with a triumphant beam. Ha, ha-di-ha. I\u2019ve been doing my homework in the cab. \u201cI particularly enjoyed a fascinating series of acrylic forms based on simple Euclidean shapes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d says Luke, looking a bit surprised.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. The way they absorb and reflect pure light... Riveting. Oh and by the way, I bought you a present.\u201d I plonk a book on his lap entitled Abstract Art and Artists, and take a sip of the drink that has been placed in front of me, trying not to look too smug.</p><p>\u201cYou really went to the Guggenheim!\u201d says Luke, leafing through the book incredulously.</p><p>\u201cErm... yes,\u201d I say. \u201cOf course I did!\u201d</p><p>OK, I know you shouldn\u2019t lie to your boyfriend. But it\u2019s kind of true, isn\u2019t it? I did go to the Guggenheim. In the broadest sense of the word.</p> <p>\u201cThis is really interesting,\u201d Luke\u2019s saying. \u201cDid you see that famous sculpture by Brancusi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm... well...\u201d I squint over his shoulder, trying to see what he\u2019s talking about. \u201cWell, I was more concentrating on the... um...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that on your cheek?\u201d says Luke, suddenly staring at me. I put a hand up in surprise and feel a trace of silver glitter. I\u2019d forgotten all about that.</p><p>\u201cIt was... a piece of installation art,\u201d I hear myself saying. \u201cEntitled Constellations. They had all this, um... glitter, and they smeared it on you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere comes Michael now,\u201d interrupts Luke. He closes the book and I quickly put it back in its carrier bag. Thank God for that. I look up interestedly to see what this famous Michael looks like \u2014 and nearly choke on my drink.</p><p>I don\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s him. Michael Ellis is the balding guy from the gym. Last time he saw me, I was dying at his feet.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d says Luke, standing up. \u201cBecky, meet Michael Ellis, my new associate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi again,\u201d I say, trying to smile composedly. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p> <p>Oh, this shouldn\u2019t be allowed. There should be a rule which says that people you\u2019ve met in the gym should never meet you in real life.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already had the pleasure of meeting,\u201d says Michael Ellis, shaking my hand with a twinkle and sitting down opposite. \u201cBecky and I worked out together at the hotel gym. Didn\u2019t catch you there this morning, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis morning?\u201d says Luke, giving me a puzzled look as he sits down again. \u201cI thought you said the gym was closed, Becky.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cOh. Um, well...\u201d I take a deep gulp of my drink and clear my throat. \u201cWhen I said it was closed, what I really meant was... was...\u201d I tail away feebly into silence.</p><p>And I so wanted to make a good impression.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I thinking of?\u201d exclaims Michael suddenly. \u201cI must be going crazy! It wasn\u2019t this morning. The gym was closed this morning. Due to vital repair work, I believe.\u201d He grins broadly and I feel myself blushing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, anyway,\u201d I say, hurriedly changing the subject. \u201cYou\u2019re... you\u2019re doing a deal with Luke. That\u2019s great! How\u2019s it all going?\u201d</p><p>I only really ask to be polite, and steer attention away from my gym activities. I\u2019m expecting them both to start explaining it to me at great length, and I can nod my head at intervals and enjoy my drink. But to my surprise, there\u2019s an awkward pause.</p><p>\u201cGood question,\u201d says Luke at last, and looks at Michael. \u201cWhat did Clark say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a long conversation,\u201d says Michael. \u201cNot entirely satisfactory.\u201d</p> <p>I look from face to face, feeling disconcerted.</p><p>\u201cIs something going wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat all depends,\u201d says Michael.</p><p>He starts to tell Luke about his phone call with whoever Clark is, and I try to listen intelligently to their conversation. But the trouble is, I\u2019m starting to feel quite giddy. How much have I drunk today? I don\u2019t even want to think about it, to be honest. I loll against the leather backrest, my eyes closed, listening to their voices chatting what seems far above my head.</p><p>\u201c... some sort of paranoia...\u201d</p> <p>\u201c... think they can change the goalposts...\u201d</p><p>\u201c... overheads... cost reduction... with Alicia Billington heading up the London office...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlicia?\u201d I struggle to an upright position. \u201cAlicia\u2019s going to run the London office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost definitely,\u201d says Luke, stopping midsentence. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d says Michael, looking at me with interest. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t she run the London office? She\u2019s bright, ambitious...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. Well... no reason,\u201d I say feebly.</p><p>I can\u2019t very well say, \u201cBecause she\u2019s a complete cow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard she\u2019s just got engaged, by the way?\u201d says Luke. \u201cTo Ed Collins at Hill Hanson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say in surprise. \u201cI thought she was having an affair with... whassisname.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith who?\u201d says Michael.</p><p>\u201cErm... thingy.\u201d I take a sip of gimlet to clear my head. \u201cShe was having secret lunches with him, and everything!\u201d</p><p>What\u2019s his name again? I really am pissed.</p><p>\u201cBecky likes to keep abreast of the office gossip,\u201d says Luke with an easy laugh. \u201cUnfortunately one can\u2019t always vouch for its accuracy.\u201d</p> <p>I stare at him crossly. What\u2019s he trying to say? That I\u2019m some kind of rumormonger?</p><p>\u201cNothing wrong with a bit of office gossip,\u201d says Michael with a warm smile. \u201cKeeps the wheels turning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I say emphatically. \u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more. I always say to Luke, you should be interested in the people who work for you. It\u2019s like when I give financial advice on my TV show. You can\u2019t just look at the numbers, you have to talk to them. Like... like Enid from Northampton!\u201d I look at Michael expectantly, before remembering that he doesn\u2019t know who Enid is. \u201cOn paper she was ready to retire,\u201d I explain. \u201cPension and everything. But in real life...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe... wasn\u2019t ready?\u201d suggests Michael.</p><p>\u201cExactly! She was really enjoying work and it was only her stupid husband who wanted her to give up. She was only fifty-five!\u201d I gesture randomly with my glass. \u201cI mean, don\u2019t they say life begins at fifty-five?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure they do,\u201d says Michael, smiling. \u201cBut maybe they should.\u201d He gives me an interested look. \u201cI\u2019d like to catch your show one day. Is it shown in the States?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d I say regretfully. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be doing the same thing on American TV soon, so you\u2019ll be able to watch it then!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look forward to that.\u201d Michael looks at his watch and drains his glass. \u201cI have to go, I\u2019m afraid. We\u2019ll speak later, Luke. And very nice to meet you, Becky. If I ever need financial advice, I\u2019ll know where to come.\u201d</p><p>As he leaves the bar, I lean back against my squashy seat and turn to look at Luke. His easy demeanor has vanished, and he\u2019s staring tensely into space while his fingers methodically tear a matchbook into small pieces.</p><p>\u201cMichael seems really nice!\u201d I say. \u201cReally friendly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Luke distantly. \u201cYes, he is.\u201d</p><p>I take a sip of gimlet and look at Luke more carefully. He\u2019s got exactly the same expression he had last month, when one of his staff cocked up a press release and some confidential figures were made public by mistake. My mind spools back over the conversation I was half-listening to \u2014 and as I watch his face I start to feel a bit worried. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLuke,\u201d I say at last. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?

And all that stuff about them changing the goalposts?\u201d</p><p>I lean forward and try to take his hand, but Luke doesn\u2019t respond. As I gaze at him in anxious silence, I gradually become aware of the background chatter and music all around us in the dim bar. At the next table a woman\u2019s opening a little box from Tiffany\u2019s and gasping \u2014 something which would normally have me throwing my napkin onto the floor and sidling over to see what she\u2019s got. But this time I\u2019m too concerned.</p> <p>\u201cLuke?\u201d I lean forward. \u201cCome on, tell me. Is there a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Luke shortly, and tips his glass back into his mouth. \u201cThere\u2019s no problem. Things are fine. Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Ten</p><p>I WAKE UP the next morning with a pounding headache. We went on from the Royalton to someplace for dinner, and I drank even more there \u2014 and I can\u2019t even remember getting back to the hotel. Thank God I don\u2019t have an interview today. To be honest, I could quite happily spend the whole day in bed with Luke.</p><p>Except that Luke is already up, sitting by the window, talking grimly into the phone.</p> <p>\u201cOK, Michael. I\u2019ll talk to Greg today. God knows. I have no idea.\u201d He listens for a bit. \u201cThat may be the case. But I\u2019m not having a second deal collapse on us.\u201d There\u2019s a pause. \u201cYes, but that would put us back \u2014 what, six months? OK. I hear what you\u2019re saying. Yes, I will. Cheers.\u201d</p><p>He puts down the receiver and stares tensely out of the window, and I rub my sleepy face, trying to remember if I packed any aspirin.</p><p>\u201cLuke, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d says Luke, turning round, and gives me a quick smile. \u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I repeat, ignoring him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine,\u201d says Luke shortly, and turns back to the window.</p> <p>\u201cEverything isn\u2019t fine!\u201d I retort. \u201cLuke, I\u2019m not blind. I\u2019m not deaf. I can tell something\u2019s up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA minor blip,\u201d says Luke after a pause. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about it.\u201d He reaches for the phone again. \u201cShall I order you some breakfast? What would you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d I cry frustratedly. \u201cLuke, I\u2019m not some... some stranger! We\u2019re going to live together, for God\u2019s sake! I\u2019m on your side. Just tell me what\u2019s really going on. Is your deal in trouble?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence \u2014 and for an awful moment I think Luke\u2019s going to tell me to mind my own business. But then he pushes his hands through his hair, exhales sharply, and looks up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. The truth is, one of our backers is getting nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, and pull a face. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause some fucking rumor\u2019s going around that we\u2019re about to lose Bank of London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I stare at him, feeling a cold dismay creep down my back. Even I know how important Bank of London is to Brandon Communications. They were one of Luke\u2019s first clients \u2014 and they still bring in about a quarter of the money the company makes every year. \u201cWhy would people be saying that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck knows.\u201d He pushes his hair back with his hands. \u201cBank of London denies it completely, of course. But then, they would. And of course it doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m here, not there...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you going to fly back to London?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He looks up. \u201cThat would give out completely the wrong signals. Things are shaky enough here already. If I suddenly disappear...\u201d He shakes his head and I stare at him apprehensively.</p><p>\u201cSo \u2014 what happens if your backer pulls out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe find someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if you can\u2019t? Will you have to give up on coming to New York?\u201d</p><p>Luke turns to look at me \u2014 and he\u2019s suddenly got that blank, scary expression that used to make me want to run away from him at press conferences.</p><p>\u201cNot an option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I mean, you\u2019ve got a really successful business in London,\u201d I persist. \u201cI mean, you don\u2019t have to set up one in New York, do you? You could just...\u201d</p><p>I tail away at the look on his face.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say nervously. \u201cWell \u2014 I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll all be OK.

It\u2019ll be a chance for you two to get to know one another. I really hope you hit it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we will,\u201d I say firmly. \u201cIt\u2019ll be really nice.\u201d I get out of bed and go and put my arms around Luke\u2019s neck. His face still looks strained, and I put up my hand to smooth away the creases in his brow. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Luke. People will be queuing up to back you. Round the block.\u201d</p><p>Luke gives a half-smile and kisses my hand.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope so.\u201d</p><p>As I sit in reception, waiting for Luke\u2019s mother to arrive, I feel a combination of nerves and intrigue. I mean, for a start, what are we going to talk about? If I were meeting his stepmum, she could tell me all about Luke when he was a little boy, and bring out all the embarrassing photographs. But Luke\u2019s real mum barely saw him when he was a little boy. Apparently she just used to send him huge presents at school, and visit about every three years.</p> <p>You\u2019d think that would have made him a bit resentful \u2014 but he adores her. In fact, he simply can\u2019t find one bad thing to say about her. I once asked him whether he minded that she left him \u2014 and he got all defensive and said she had no choice. And he\u2019s got this enormous glamorous photograph of her in his study at home \u2014 much bigger than the one of his dad and stepmum on their wedding day. I do sometimes wonder what they think about that. But it\u2019s not something I really feel I can bring up.</p><p>\u201cRebecca?\u201d A voice interrupts my thoughts and I look up, startled. A tall, elegant woman in a pale suit, with very long legs and crocodile shoes, is staring down at me. It\u2019s the glamorous photograph in the flesh! And she looks just the same as she does in the picture, with high cheekbones and dark, Jackie Kennedy \u2014 style hair \u2014 except her skin is kind of tighter, and her eyes are unnaturally wide. In fact, it looks as though she might have some difficulty closing them.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d I say, getting awkwardly to my feet and holding out my hand. \u201cHow do you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElinor Sherman,\u201d she says in a strange half-English, half-American drawl. Her hand is cold and bony, and she\u2019s wearing two enormous diamond rings that press into my flesh. \u201cSo pleased to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke was very sorry he couldn\u2019t make it,\u201d I say, and hand her the present he gave me to give. As she undoes the wrapping, I can\u2019t help goggling. A Herm`es scarf!</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d she says dismissively, and puts it back into the box. \u201cMy car is waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke was really hoping we might get to know each other a bit,\u201d I say, with a friendly smile.</p><p>\u201cI have until two fifteen,\u201d says Elinor crisply.</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say. \u201cWell, never m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that should be ample time. Shall we go?\u201d</p><p>Blimey. A car with a chauffeur. And a crocodile Kelly bag \u2014 and are those earrings real emeralds?</p><p>As we drive away, I can\u2019t help surreptitiously staring at Elinor. Now I\u2019m close up I realize she\u2019s older than I first thought, probably in her fifties. And although she looks wonderful, it\u2019s a bit as though that glamorous photo has been left out in the sun and lost its color \u2014 and then been painted over with makeup. Her lashes are heavy with mascara and her hair is shiny with lacquer and her nails are so heavily varnished, they could be red porcelain. She\u2019s so completely... done. Groomed in a way I know I could never be, however many people went to work on me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I mean, I\u2019m looking quite nice today, I think. In fact, I\u2019m looking really sharp. There was a spread in American Vogue on how black and white is the look at the moment, so I\u2019ve teamed a black pencil skirt with a white shirt I found in the sample sale the other day, and black shoes with fantastic high heels. And I\u2019ve shaded my eyes just like Mona showed me. I was really pleased with myself this morning. But now, as Elinor surveys me, I\u2019m suddenly aware that one of my nails is very slightly chipped, and my shoe has got a tiny smear on the side \u2014 and oh God, is that a thread hanging down from my skirt? Should I quickly try to pull it off?</p><p>Casually, I put my hand down on my lap to cover up the loose thread. Maybe she didn\u2019t see. It\u2019s not that obvious, is it?</p><p>But Elinor is silently reaching into her bag, and a moment later she hands me a pair of small silver tortoiseshell-handled scissors.</p><p>\u201cOh... er, thanks,\u201d I say awkwardly. I snip the offending thread, and hand back the scissors, feeling like a schoolchild. \u201cThat always happens,\u201d I add, and give a nervous little giggle. \u201cI look in the mirror in the morning and I think I look fine, but then the minute I get out of the house...\u201d</p> <p>Great, now I\u2019m gabbling. Slow down, Becky.</p><p>\u201cThe English are incapable of good grooming,\u201d says Elinor. \u201cUnless it\u2019s a horse.\u201d</p><p>The corners of her lips move a couple of millimeters up into a smile \u2014 although the rest of her face is static \u2014 and I burst into sycophantic laughter.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really good! My flatmate loves horses. But I mean, you\u2019re English, aren\u2019t you? And you look absolutely... immaculate!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m really pleased I\u2019ve managed to throw in a little compliment, but Elinor\u2019s smile abruptly disappears. She gives me a blank stare and suddenly I can see where Luke gets that impassive scary expression from.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a naturalized American citizen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d I say. \u201cWell, I suppose you\u2019ve been here for a while. But I mean, in your heart, aren\u2019t you still... wouldn\u2019t you say you\u2019re a... I mean, Luke\u2019s very English...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have lived in New York for the majority of my adult life,\u201d says Elinor coldly. \u201cAny attachment of mine to Britain has long disappeared. The place is twenty years out of date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nod fervently, trying to look as though I understand completely. God, this is hard work. I feel like I\u2019m being observed under a microscope. Why couldn\u2019t Luke have come? Or why couldn\u2019t she have rescheduled? I mean, doesn\u2019t she want to see him?</p><p>\u201cRebecca, who colors your hair?\u201d says Elinor abruptly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... it\u2019s my own,\u201d I say, nervously touching a strand.</p> <p>\u201cMeione,\u201d she echoes suspiciously. \u201cI don\u2019t know the name. At which salon does she work?\u201d</p><p>For a moment I\u2019m completely silenced.</p><p>\u201cErm... well,\u201d I flounder at last. \u201cActually... I... I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll have heard of it. It\u2019s very... tiny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think you should change colorist,\u201d says Elinor. \u201cIt\u2019s a very unsubtle shade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuinevere von Landlenburg swears by Julien on Bond Street. Do you know Guinevere von Landlenburg?\u201d</p><p>I hesitate thoughtfully, as though going through a mental address book. As though checking all the many, many Guineveres I know.</p><p>\u201cUm... no,\u201d I say at last. \u201cI don\u2019t think I do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey have a house in South Hampton.\u201d She takes out a compact and checks her reflection. \u201cWe spent some time there last year with the de Bonnevilles.\u201d</p><p>I stiffen. The de Bonnevilles. As in Sacha de Bonneville. As in Luke\u2019s old girlfriend.</p><p>Luke never told me they were friends of the family.</p><p>OK, I\u2019m not going to stress. Just because Elinor is tactless enough to mention Sacha\u2019s family. It\u2019s not as though she\u2019s actually mentioned her\u2014</p><p>\u201cSacha is such an accomplished girl,\u201d says Elinor, snapping her compact shut. \u201cHave you ever seen her water-ski?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr play polo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say morosely. \u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly Elinor is rapping imperiously on the glass panel behind the driver.</p><p>\u201cYou took that corner too fast!\u201d she says. \u201cI won\u2019t tell you again, I don\u2019t wish to be rocked in my seat. So, Rebecca,\u201d she says, sitting back in her seat and giving me a dissatisfied glance. \u201cWhat are your own hobbies?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUhm...\u201d I open my mouth and close it again. My mind\u2019s gone completely blank. Come on, I must have some hobbies. What do I do at the weekends? What do I do to relax?</p><p>\u201cWell, I...\u201d</p><p>This is completely ridiculous. There must be things in my life other than shopping.</p><p>\u201cWell, obviously, I enjoy... socializing with friends,\u201d I begin hesitantly. \u201cAnd also the... the study of fashion through the um... medium of magazines...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you a sportswoman?\u201d says Elinor, eyeing me coldly. \u201cDo you hunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm... no. But... I\u2019ve recently taken up fencing!\u201d I add in sudden inspiration. I\u2019ve got the outfit, haven\u2019t I? \u201cAnd I\u2019ve played the piano since I was six.\u201d</p><p>Completely true. No need to mention that I gave up when I was nine.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d says Elinor, and gives a wintry smile. \u201cSacha is also very musical. She gave a recital of Beethoven piano sonatas in London last year. Did you go to it?\u201d</p><p>Bloody Sacha. With her bloody water-skiing and bloody sonatas.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say defiantly. \u201cBut I... I gave one myself, as it happens. Of... of Wagner sonatas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWagner sonatas?\u201d echoes Elinor suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cErm... yes.\u201d I clear my throat, trying to think how to get off the subject of accomplishments. \u201cSo! You must be very proud of Luke!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m hoping this comment will trigger a happy speech from her lasting ten minutes. But Elinor simply looks at me silently, as though I\u2019m speaking nonsense.</p><p>\u201cWith his... his company and everything,\u201d I press on doggedly. \u201cHe\u2019s such a success. And he seems very determined to make it in New York. In America.\u201d Elinor gives me a patronizing smile.</p><p>\u201cNo one is anything till they make it in America.\u201d She looks out of the window. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p> <p>Thank God for that.</p><p>To give Elinor her due, the beauty spa is absolutely amazing. The reception area is exactly like a Greek grotto, with pillars and soft music and a lovely scent of essential oils in the air. We go up to the reception desk, where a smart woman in black linen calls Elinor \u201cMrs. Sherman\u201d very deferentially. They talk for a while in lowered voices, and the woman occasionally gives me a glance and nods her head, and I try to pretend not to be listening, looking at the price list for bath oils. Then abruptly Elinor turns away and ushers me to a seating area where there\u2019s a jug of mint tea and a sign asking patrons to respect the tranquility of the spa and keep their voices down.</p><p>We sit in silence for a while \u2014 then a girl in a white uniform comes to collect me and takes me to a treatment room, where a robe and slippers are waiting, all wrapped in embossed cellophane. As I get changed, she\u2019s busying herself at her counter of goodies, and I wonder pleasurably what I\u2019ve got in store. Elinor insisted on paying for all my treatments herself, however much I tried to chip in \u2014 and apparently she selected the \u201ctop-to-toe grooming\u201d treatment, whatever that is. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll include a nice relaxing aromatherapy massage \u2014 but as I sit down on the couch, I see a pot full of wax heating up.</p><p>I feel an unpleasant lurch in my tummy. I\u2019ve never been that great at having my legs waxed. Which is not because I\u2019m afraid of pain, but because\u2014</p><p>Well, OK. It\u2019s because I\u2019m afraid of pain.</p><p>\u201cSo \u2014 does my treatment include waxing?\u201d I say, trying to sound lighthearted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re booked in for a full waxing program,\u201d says the beautician, looking up in surprise. \u201cThe \u2018top-to-toe.\u2019 Legs, arms, eyebrows, and Brazilian.\u201d</p><p>Arms? Eyebrows? I can feel my throat tightening in fear. I haven\u2019t been this scared since I had my jabs for Thailand.</p> <p>\u201cBrazilian?\u201d I say in a scratchy voice. \u201cWhat... what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a form of bikini wax. A total wax.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, my mind working overtime. She can\u2019t possibly mean\u2014</p><p>\u201cSo if you\u2019d like to lie down on the couch\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I say, trying to keep my voice calm. \u201cWhen you say \u2018total,\u2019 do you mean...\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d The beautician smiles. \u201cThen, if you wish, I can apply a small crystal tattoo to the... area. A love heart is quite popular. Or perhaps the initials of someone special?\u201d</p><p>No. This can\u2019t be real.</p><p>\u201cSo, if you could just lie back on the couch and relax\u2014\u201d</p><p>Relax? Relax?</p><p>She turns back to her pot of molten wax \u2014 and I feel a surge of pure terror. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing it,\u201d I hear myself saying, and slither off the couch. \u201cI\u2019m not having it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tattoo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny of it?\u201d</p> <p>The beautician comes toward me, the wax pot in hand \u2014 and in panic I dodge behind the couch, clasping my robe defensively around me.</p><p>\u201cBut Mrs. Sherman has already prepaid for the entire treatment\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what she\u2019s paid for,\u201d I say, backing away. \u201cYou can wax my legs. But not my arms. And definitely not... that other one. The crystal love heart one.\u201d</p><p>The beautician looks worried.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Sherman is one of our most regular customers. She specifically requested the \u2018top-to-toe wax\u2019 for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019ll never know!\u201d I say desperately. \u201cShe\u2019ll never know! I mean, she\u2019s not exactly going to look, is she? She\u2019s not going to ask her son if his initials are tattooed on his girlfriend\u2019s...\u201d I can\u2019t bring myself to say area. \u201cI mean, come on. Is she?\u201d</p><p>I break off, and there\u2019s a tense silence, broken only by the sound of tootling panpipes.</p><p>Then suddenly the beautician gives a snort of laughter. I catch her eye \u2014 and find myself starting to laugh, too, albeit slightly hysterically.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d says the beautician, sitting down and wiping her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re right. She\u2019ll never know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a compromise?\u201d I say. \u201cYou do my legs and eyebrows and we keep quiet about the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could give you a massage instead,\u201d says the beautician. \u201cUse up the time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere we are, then!\u201d I say in relief. \u201cPerfect!\u201d</p><p>Feeling slightly drained, I lie down on the couch, and the beautician covers me up expertly with a towel.</p><p>\u201cSo, does Mrs. Sherman have a son, then?\u201d she says, smoothing back my hair.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I look up, taken aback. \u201cHas she never even mentioned him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I recall. And she\u2019s been coming here for years...\u201d The beautician shrugs. \u201cI guess I always assumed she didn\u2019t have any children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d I say, and lie back down, trying not to give away my surprise.</p><p>When I emerge an hour and a half later, I feel fantastic. I\u2019ve got brand-new eyebrows, smooth legs, and a glow all over from the most wonderful aromatherapy massage.</p><p>Elinor is waiting for me in reception, and as I come toward her, she runs her eyes appraisingly up and down my body. For a horrible moment I think she\u2019s going to ask me to roll up my sleeves to check the smoothness of my arms \u2014 but all she says is, \u201cYour eyebrows look a lot better.\u201d Then she turns and walks out, and I hurry after her.</p> <p>As we get back into the car, I ask, \u201cWhere are we having lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNina Heywood is holding a small informal charity lunch for Ugandan famine relief,\u201d she replies, examining one of her immaculate nails. \u201cShe holds events like this nearly every month. Do you know the Heywoods? Or the van Gelders?\u201d</p><p>Of course I don\u2019t bloody know them.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I hear myself saying. \u201cBut I know the Websters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Websters?\u201d She raises her arched eyebrows. \u201cThe Newport Websters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Oxshott Websters. Janice and Martin.\u201d I give her an innocent look. \u201cDo you know them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Elinor, giving me a frosty look. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I do.\u201d</p><p>For the rest of the journey we travel in silence. Then suddenly the car is stopping and we\u2019re getting out, and walking into the grandest, most enormous lobby I\u2019ve ever seen, with a doorman in uniform and mirrors everywhere. We go up what seems like a zillion floors in a gilded lift with a man in a peaked cap, and into an apartment. And I have never seen anything like it.</p><p>The place is absolutely enormous, with a marble floor and a double staircase and a grand piano on a platform. The pale silk walls are decorated with enormous gold-framed paintings, and on pedestals around the room there are cascading flower arrangements like I\u2019ve never seen before. Pin-thin women in expensive clothes are talking animatedly to one another, a smaller number of well-dressed men are listening politely, there are waitresses handing out champagne, and a girl in a flowing dress is playing the harp.</p><p>And this is a small charity lunch?</p><p>Our hostess Mrs. Heywood is a tiny woman in pink, who is about to shake hands with me when she\u2019s distracted by the arrival of a woman in a bejeweled turban. Elinor introduces me to a Mrs. Parker, a Mr. Wunsch, and a Miss Kutomi, then drifts away, and I make conversation as best I can, even though everyone seems to assume I must be a close friend of Prince William. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTell me,\u201d says Mrs. Parker urgently. \u201cHow is that poor young man bearing up after his... great loss?\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cThat boy has a natural nobility,\u201d says Mr. Wunsch fiercely. \u201cYoung people today could learn a lot from him. Tell me, is it the army he\u2019s headed for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe... he hasn\u2019t mentioned it,\u201d I say helplessly. \u201cWould you excuse me.\u201d</p><p>I escape to the bathroom \u2014 and that\u2019s just as huge and sumptuous as the rest of the apartment, with racks of luxury soaps and bottles of free perfume, and a comfy chair to sit in. I kind of wish I could stay there all day, actually. But I don\u2019t dare linger too long in case Elinor comes looking for me. So with a final squirt of Eternity, I force myself to get up and go back into the throng, where waiters are moving quietly around, murmuring, \u201cLunch will be served now.\u201d</p> <p>As everyone moves toward a set of grand double doors I look around for Elinor but I can\u2019t see her. There\u2019s an old lady in black lace sitting on a chair near to me, and she begins to stand up with the aid of a walking stick.</p><p>\u201cLet me help,\u201d I say, hurrying forward as her grip falters. \u201cShall I hold your champagne glass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, my dear!\u201d The lady smiles at me as I take her arm, and we walk slowly together into the palatial dining room. People are pulling out chairs and sitting down at circular tables, and waiters are hurrying round with bread rolls.</p><p>\u201cMargaret,\u201d says Mrs. Heywood, coming forward and holding out her hands to the old lady. \u201cThere you are. Now let me find your seat...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis young lady was assisting me,\u201d says the old lady as she lowers herself onto a chair, and I smile modestly at Mrs. Heywood.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, dear,\u201d she says absently. \u201cNow, could you take my glass too, please... and bring some water to our table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d I say with a friendly smile. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll have a gin and tonic,\u201d adds an elderly man nearby, swiveling in his chair.</p><p>\u201cComing right up!\u201d</p><p>It just shows, what Mum says is right. The way to make a friend is to give a helping hand. I feel quite special, helping out the hostess. It\u2019s almost like I\u2019m throwing the party with her!</p><p>I\u2019m not sure where the kitchen is, but the waiters are all heading toward one end of the room. I follow them through a set of double doors, and find myself in the kind of kitchen Mum would absolutely die for. Granite and marble everywhere, and a fridge which looks like a space rocket, and a pizza oven set into the wall! There are waiters in white shirts hurrying in and out with trays, and two chefs standing at a central island hob, holding sizzling pans, and someone\u2019s yelling, \u201cWhere the fuck are the napkins?\u201d</p> <p>I find a bottle of water and a glass, and put them on a tray, then start looking around to see where the gin might be. As I bend down to open a cupboard door, a man with cropped bleached hair taps me on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHey. What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hi!\u201d I say, standing up. \u201cI\u2019m just looking for the gin, actually. Somebody wanted a gin and tonic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t got time for that!\u201d he barks. \u201cDo you realize how short-staffed we are? We need food on tables!\u201d</p><p>Short-staffed? I stare at him blankly for a moment. Then, as my eye falls on my black skirt and the realization hits me, I give a shocked laugh.</p><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m not a... I mean, I\u2019m actually one of the...\u201d</p><p>How do I say this without offending him? I\u2019m sure being a waiter is actually very fulfilling. Anyway, he\u2019s probably an actor in his spare time.</p><p>But while I\u2019m dithering, he dumps a silver platter full of smoked fish in my arms.</p> <p>\u201cGet! Now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow! Food on tables!\u201d</p><p>With a pang of fright I quickly hurry away. OK. What I\u2019ll do is I\u2019ll just get away from him, and put this platter down somewhere, and find my place.</p><p>Cautiously I walk back into the dining room, and wander about between the tables, looking for a handy surface to leave the platter. But there don\u2019t seem to be any side tables or even spare chairs. I can\u2019t really leave it on the floor, and it would be a bit too awkward to reach between the guests and dump it on a table.</p><p>This is really annoying, actually. The platter\u2019s quite heavy, and my arms are starting to ache. I pass by Mr. Wunsch\u2019s chair and give him a little smile, but he doesn\u2019t even notice me. It\u2019s as though I\u2019m suddenly invisible.</p><p>This is ridiculous. There must be somewhere I can put it down.</p><p>\u201cWill-you-serve-the-food!\u201d hisses a furious voice behind me, and I feel myself jump. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOK!\u201d I retort, feeling slightly rattled. \u201cOK, I will!\u201d</p><p>Oh, for goodness\u2019 sake. It\u2019s probably easier just to serve it. Then at least it\u2019ll be gone, and I can sit down. Hesitantly I approach the nearest table.</p><p>\u201cErm... would anyone like some smoked fish? I think this is salmon... and this is trout...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca?\u201d</p> <p>The elegantly coiffured head in front of me swivels round and I give a startled leap. Elinor is staring up at me, her eyes like daggers.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say nervously. \u201cWould you like some fish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she says in a low, furious voice.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I swallow. \u201cWell, I was just, you know, helping out...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have some smoked salmon, thanks,\u201d says a woman in a gold jacket. \u201cDo you have any nonfat French dressing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cErm... well, the thing is, I\u2019m not actually...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca!\u201d Elinor\u2019s voice comes shooting out of her barely opened mouth. \u201cPut it down. Just... sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Of course.\u201d I glance uncertainly at the platter. \u201cOr should I serve it, since I\u2019m here anyway...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut it down. Now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I look helplessly about for a moment, then see a waiter coming toward me with an empty tray. Before he can protest I deposit the smoked fish platter on his tray, then hurry round with trembling legs to my empty chair, smoothing down my hair.</p><p>As I sit down, and spread my thick napkin over my knees, there\u2019s silence around the table. I try a friendly little smile, but nobody responds. Then an old lady wearing about six rows of huge pearls and a hearing aid leans toward Elinor and whispers, so audibly we can all hear, \u201cYour son is dating... a waitress?\u201d</p> <p>Eleven</p><p>\u201cSHE DID?\u201d There\u2019s a long pause. Luke frowns and glances at me. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t...\u201d He breaks off into silence and I feel a flutter of apprehension.</p><p>It\u2019s a couple of days later, and on the other end of the phone, speaking to Luke, is Elinor. God only knows what she\u2019s saying about me. I wish we had a speaker phone.</p><p>On second thought, no, I don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Luke looks surprised. \u201cI see. Interesting.\u201d He clears his throat. \u201cAnd on that matter \u2014 what about the two of us trying to meet up?\u201d</p><p>Thank goodness. They\u2019ve stopped talking about me.</p><p>\u201cOh, I see.\u201d The deflation in Luke\u2019s voice is unmistakable. \u201cNo, of course I understand. Yes, I will. Bye, then.\u201d He puts down the phone and gazes down at it for a few seconds.</p><p>\u201cSo!\u201d I say, trying to sound relaxed. \u201cWhat did your mother think of me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh! Well...\u201d Luke screws up his face puzzledly. \u201cShe said you were... overzealous. What did she mean by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no idea!\u201d I give a shrill laugh. \u201cProbably just... you know... hardworking! So, erm... did she mention your gift?\u201d I add, changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Luke after a pause. \u201cAs a matter of fact, she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, feeling a pang of indignation toward Elinor. \u201cWell, you know, she did absolutely love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I say emphatically. \u201cShe... she almost cried, she was so pleased. And she said you were the best son in the whole world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Luke\u2019s face glows with pleasure. \u201cShe said that?\u201d</p><p>I smile vaguely and reach down for my shoes. Maybe that wasn\u2019t quite true. But I mean, I can\u2019t tell him she just shoved it back into the box as though it were a pair of socks from Woolworth\u2019s, can I?</p><p>\u201cSee you later.\u201d Luke picks up his briefcase and gives me a kiss. \u201cAnd good luck this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d I beam back, and feel a small trickle of excitement.</p><p>All of a sudden, things have started to happen over here. I keep getting phone calls from people who want to meet me, which Luke says is the \u201csnowball effect\u201d and he expected it all along. Yesterday I had three meetings with different sets of TV executives \u2014 today I\u2019ve got a breakfast meeting with a Greg Walters from Blue River Productions. He\u2019s the one who sent me the basket of fruit and was \u201cdesperate\u201d to see me. I\u2019ve never had anyone desperate to see me before in my entire life!</p><p>An hour later, I\u2019m sitting in the Four Seasons restaurant, feeling like a movie star. Greg Walters is tall and tanned and has already dropped the name of every TV network I\u2019ve ever heard of. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re hot,\u201d he now keeps saying, in between bites of croissant. \u201cYou realize that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm... well...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He lifts a hand. \u201cDon\u2019t be coy. You\u2019re all over town. Folks are fighting over you.\u201d He takes a sip of coffee and looks me in the eye. \u201cI\u2019ll be frank \u2014 I want to give you your own show.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, almost unable to breathe for excitement.</p> <p>\u201cReally? My own show? Doing what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. We\u2019ll find you a winning format.\u201d He takes a gulp of coffee. \u201cYou\u2019re a political commentator, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm... not really,\u201d I say awkwardly. \u201cI do personal finance. You know, mortgages and stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Greg nods. \u201cFinance. So I\u2019m thinking... off the top of my head... Wall Street. Wall Street meets Ab Fab meets Oprah. You could do that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm... absolutely!\u201d</p> <p>I beam confidently at him and take a bite of croissant.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d he says as he finishes his coffee. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to call you tomorrow and set up a meeting with our head of development. Is that OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d I say, trying to look as nonchalant as possible. \u201cThat would be good.\u201d</p><p>As he walks off, a huge grin of delight spreads across my face. My own show! Things are just going better and better. Everyone I speak to seems to want to offer me a job, and they all keep buying me nice meals, and yesterday, someone said I could have a career in Hollywood, no question. Hollywood!</p><p>I mean, just imagine if I get my own show in Hollywood! I\u2019ll be able to live in some amazing house in Beverly Hills, and go to parties with all the film stars. Maybe Luke will start a Los Angeles branch of his company. I mean, people out there need PR \u2014 and he could easily switch from finance to movies. And... yes! We could set up a film production company together!</p><p>\u201cWhat a pleasant surprise,\u201d says a cheerful voice, and I look up dazedly to see Michael Ellis pulling out a chair at another table.</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, wrenching my mind away from the Oscars. \u201cOh, hello. Do join me!\u201d And I gesture politely to the chair opposite.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not disturbing you?\u201d he says, sitting down.</p><p>\u201cNo. I was having a meeting but it\u2019s over.\u201d I look around vaguely. \u201cIs Luke with you?\u201d</p><p>Michael shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s talking to some people at JD Slade this morning. The big guns.\u201d</p><p>A waiter comes and clears away Greg\u2019s plate, and Michael orders a cappuccino.</p><p>\u201cSo \u2014 how are things going?\u201d I ask, lowering my voice slightly. \u201cLuke told me about one of the backers getting nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Michael nods gravely. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell\u2019s going on there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut why do you need backers?\u201d I ask. \u201cI mean, Luke\u2019s got loads of money...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever invest your own money,\u201d says Michael. \u201cFirst rule of business. Besides which, Luke has very grand plans, and grand plans tend to need a lot of capital.\u201d He looks up. \u201cYou know, he\u2019s very driven, that man of yours. Very determined to succeed over here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say, rolling my eyes. \u201cAll he ever does is work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork is good,\u201d says Michael, frowning into his coffee. \u201cObsession is... not so good.\u201d He\u2019s silent for a moment, then looks up with a smile. \u201cBut I gather things are going well for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are, actually,\u201d I say, unable to maintain my calm. \u201cIn fact, they\u2019re going brilliantly! I\u2019ve had all these fantastic meetings, and everybody says they want to give me a job! I just had a meeting with Greg Walters from Blue River Productions \u2014 and he said he was going to give me my own show. And yesterday, someone was talking about Hollywood!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d says Michael. \u201cReally great.\u201d He takes a sip of coffee and looks at me thoughtfully. \u201cIf I could just say a word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese TV people. You don\u2019t necessarily want to believe every single word they say.\u201d</p><p>I look at him, a little discomfited.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese guys like talking big,\u201d says Michael, slowly stirring his coffee. \u201cIt makes them feel good. And they believe everything they say at the time when they\u2019re saying it. But when it comes to the cold hard dollar...\u201d He stops, and looks up at me. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to be disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be disappointed!\u201d I retort indignantly. \u201cGreg Walters said the whole town was fighting over me!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he did,\u201d says Michael. \u201cAnd I very much hope they are.

It looks like they mean business.\u201d I give the piece of paper to Michael Ellis, wanting to add, \u201cSo there!\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Please call Kent\u2019s assistant to arrange a screen test,\u2019 \u201d reads Michael aloud. \u201cWell, looks like I\u2019m wrong,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cAnd I\u2019m very glad about it.\u201d He lifts his coffee cup toward me. \u201cSo here\u2019s to a successful screen test.\u201d</p><p>OK. What am I going to wear tomorrow? What am I going to wear? I mean, this is the most important moment of my life, a screen test for American television. My outfit has to be sharp, flattering, photogenic, immaculate... I mean, I\u2019ve got nothing. Nothing.</p><p>I leaf through all my clothes for the millionth time, and flop back down on the bed, exhausted. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve come all this way without one single screen-test outfit.</p> <p>Well, there\u2019s nothing for it.

That\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you?\u201d I frown slightly at her voice. \u201cIs everything OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes!\u201d says Suze. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine. Except...\u201d She hesitates. \u201cI just thought you should know, a man phoned up this morning about some money you owe a shop. La Rosa, in Hampstead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I pull a face. \u201cThem again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He asked me when you were going to be out of the artificial limb unit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cRight. So \u2014 what did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex, why did he think you were in the artificial limb unit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say evasively. \u201cMaybe he heard something. Or... or I may possibly have written him the odd little letter...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex,\u201d interrupts Suze, and her voice is quivering slightly. \u201cYou told me you\u2019d taken care of all those bills. You promised!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have taken care of them!\u201d I reach for my hairbrush and begin to brush my hair.</p><p>\u201cBy telling them your parachute didn\u2019t open in time?\u201d cries Suze. \u201cI mean, honestly, Bex\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, don\u2019t stress. I\u2019ll sort it all out as soon as I come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he was going to have to take extreme action! He said he was very sorry, but enough allowances had been made, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey always say that,\u201d I say soothingly. \u201cSuze, you really don\u2019t have to worry. I\u2019m going to earn loads over here. I\u2019ll be loaded! And I\u2019ll be able to pay everything off, and everything will be fine.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence, and I imagine Suze sitting on the floor of the sitting room, winding her hair tightly round her fingers.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she says at last. \u201cIs it all going well, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! I\u2019ve got a screen test tomorrow, and this guy wants to give me my own show, and they\u2019re even talking about Hollywood!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHollywood?\u201d breathes Suze. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d I beam at my own reflection. \u201cIsn\u2019t it great?

You completely promised me you were going to stick to a budget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have! I\u2019ve completely stuck to it! It\u2019s all written out and everything!

Listen, Suze, I\u2019ve got to run. But honestly, don\u2019t worry. If anyone else phones for me, just don\u2019t take the call. OK?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell... OK,\u201d says Suze. \u201cAnd good luck tomorrow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d I say, and put down the phone. Ha-ha-ha! Off to Barneys!</p><p>Barneys. I\u2019ve kind of been saving it for last, like an extra-special chocolate. Now, as I push through the distinctive black revolving doors and walk slowly across the pale mosaic floor, looking at all the beautiful people peering into cabinets full of contemporary jewelry... I feel like Goldilocks picking the right chair. The music is buzzy and the atmosphere is great, and everyone looks like they\u2019re having a great time...</p><p>For a while I linger at a cabinet with a stunning aquamarine crystal necklace in it. I\u2019d look just like a mermaid in that. I wonder how much it is? I\u2019m just peering to see the price tag when an assistant approaches \u2014 and I come to with a jolt. I\u2019m not here to buy a necklace. I\u2019m going to buy what I need.</p><p>Feeling virtuous, I force myself to move away from the cabinet. Down to business. I study the store guide, then I take the escalator up to the top floor of the store, glimpsing tanks of fish, cages of brightly colored birds... and everywhere I look, gorgeous clothes.</p><p>Oh God, the clothes. They are just the most beautiful things I\u2019ve ever seen! Everywhere I look, I see shapes and colors and designs I just want to grab and touch and stroke. But I can\u2019t just spend all day marveling at candy-colored knitwear and beaded mules. I have to be focused. An outfit for tomorrow, nothing else.</p> <p>Right. So what exactly do I want? Maybe a jacket, so I look authoritative \u2014 but it has to be the right jacket. Not too boxy, not too stiff... just nice clean lines. And maybe a skirt. Or just look at those trousers. They would look fantastic, if I had the right shoes...</p><p>I wander slowly round each floor, making mental notes. Then at last, when I\u2019m sure I haven\u2019t left anything out, I start collecting all my possibilities. A Calvin Klein jacket... and a skirt...</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>A voice interrupts me just as I\u2019m reaching for a sleeveless top, and I turn in surprise. A woman in a black trouser suit is smiling at me.</p><p>\u201cWould you like any help with your shopping today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm... oh, thanks!\u201d I say. \u201cIf you could hold these...\u201d I hand her the garments I\u2019ve already picked out and her smile flickers slightly.</p><p>\u201cWhen I said help... we\u2019re running a unique promotion of our personal shopping department today. We\u2019d like to introduce the concept to a wider audience. So if you\u2019d like to take up the offer of an introductory session, there are some slots still available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d I say interestedly. \u201cWhat exactly would that\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur trained, experienced personal shoppers can help you find exactly what you\u2019re searching for,\u201d says the woman pleasantly. \u201cThey can help you find your own style, focus on designs that suit you, and guide you through the daunting fashion maze.\u201d She gives a tight little laugh, and I get the feeling she\u2019s said this little spiel quite a few times today.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d I say thoughtfully. \u201cThe thing is... I\u2019m not sure I really need guiding. So thanks very much, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe service is complimentary,\u201d says the woman. \u201cToday we\u2019re also offering tea, coffee, or a glass of champagne.\u201d</p><p>Champagne? Free champagne?</p><p>\u201cOoh!\u201d I say. \u201cWell, actually \u2014 that sounds really good. Yes, please!\u201d</p><p>And actually, I think as I follow her to the third floor, these trained shoppers must really know their stuff \u2014 and they\u2019ll probably have a completely different eye. They\u2019ll probably show me a whole side of myself that I\u2019ve never even seen before! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We arrive at a suite of large dressing rooms, and the woman shows me in with a smile.</p><p>\u201cYour personal shopper today will be Erin,\u201d she says. \u201cErin has only recently joined us, so she will be receiving some occasional guidance from a senior Barneys shopper. Will that be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I say, taking off my coat.</p><p>\u201cWould you prefer tea, coffee, or champagne?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChampagne,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d she says with a smile. \u201cAh, and here\u2019s Erin.\u201d</p><p>I look up with interest, to see a tall thin girl coming into the dressing room. She\u2019s got straight blond hair and a small, kind of squashed-looking mouth. In fact her whole face looks as though she were once squeezed between a pair of lift doors and never quite recovered.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she says, and I watch her mouth in fascination as she smiles. \u201cI\u2019m Erin \u2014 and I\u2019ll be helping you find the outfit to best suit your needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d I say. \u201cCan\u2019t wait!\u201d</p> <p>I wonder how this Erin got her job. Not by her taste in shoes, certainly.</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d Erin looks at me thoughtfully. \u201cWhat were you looking for today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a screen test tomorrow,\u201d I explain. \u201cI want to look kind of... smart and sassy, but approachable, too. Maybe with a little witty twist somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA witty twist,\u201d echoes Erin, scribbling on her pad. \u201cRight. And were you thinking... a suit? A jacket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I say, and launch into an exact explanation of what I\u2019m looking for. Erin listens carefully, and I notice a dark-haired woman in tortoiseshell glasses occasionally coming to the door of our dressing room and listening too.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d says Erin, when I\u2019ve finished. \u201cWell, you certainly have some ideas there...\u201d She taps her teeth for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m thinking... we have a very nice fitted jacket by Moschino, with roses on the collar...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I know the one!\u201d I say in delight. \u201cI was thinking of that, too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlong with... there\u2019s a new skirt in the Barneys collection...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe black one?\u201d I say. \u201cWith the buttons just here? Yes, I thought of that, but it\u2019s a bit short. I was thinking of the knee-length one. You know, with the ribbon round the hem...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d says Erin, with a pleasant smile. \u201cLet me line up some pieces for you, and we can have a look.\u201d</p><p>As she goes off to gather up clothes, I sit down and sip my champagne. This isn\u2019t bad, actually. I mean, it\u2019s much less effort than trawling round the shop myself. I can half-hear a murmured conversation going on in the dressing room next door \u2014 and suddenly a woman\u2019s voice rises in distress, saying, \u201cI just want to show that bastard. I just want to show him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we will show him, Marcia,\u201d replies a calm, soothing voice, which I think belongs to the woman in tortoiseshell glasses. \u201cWe will. But not in a cherry-red pantsuit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkaaay!\u201d Erin is back in the dressing room, wheeling in a rack of clothes. I run my eye quickly over them, and notice quite a few of the things I\u2019d already picked out for myself. But what about the knee-length skirt? And what about that amazing aubergine trouser suit with the leather collar?</p><p>\u201cSo, here\u2019s the jacket for you to try... and the skirt...\u201d</p> <p>I take the clothes from her, and look doubtfully at the skirt. I just know it\u2019s going to be too short. But then, she\u2019s the expert, I suppose... Quickly I change into the skirt and jacket \u2014 then come and stand in front of the mirror, next to Erin.</p><p>\u201cThe jacket\u2019s fabulous!\u201d I say. \u201cAnd it fits me perfectly. I love the cut.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t really want to say anything about the skirt. I mean, I don\u2019t want to hurt her feelings \u2014 but it looks all wrong.</p><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s see,\u201d says Erin. She stands with her head on one side and squints at my reflection. \u201cI\u2019m thinking a skirt to the knee might look better, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the one I told you about!\u201d I say in relief. \u201cIt\u2019s on the seventh floor, right next to the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly,\u201d she says, and smiles. \u201cBut I have a few other skirts in mind...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr the Dolce &amp; Gabbana one on the third floor,\u201d I add. \u201cI was looking at it earlier. Or the DKNY.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDKNY?\u201d says Erin, wrinkling her brow. \u201cI don\u2019t believe...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe assistant there told me they\u2019re new in. So nice. You should have a look at them!\u201d I turn round and look carefully at her outfit. \u201cYou know what? The mauve DKNY would look really good with that turtleneck you\u2019re wearing. And you could team it with a pair of those new Stephane Kelian boots with the spiky heels. You know the ones?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know the ones,\u201d says Erin tightly. \u201cThe crocodile and suede ones.\u201d I look at her in surprise.</p><p>\u201cNo, not those ones. The new range. With the stitching up the back. They\u2019re so gorgeous! In fact they\u2019d go well with the knee-length skirt...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d interrupts Erin sharply. \u201cI\u2019ll bear that in mind.\u201d</p><p>Honestly. I\u2019m only giving her a few hints. You\u2019d think she\u2019d be pleased I was so interested in her shop!</p> <p>Although, I have to say, she doesn\u2019t seem to know it very well.</p><p>\u201cHello there!\u201d comes a voice from the door \u2014 and the woman in tortoiseshell glasses is leaning against the door frame, looking at me interestedly. \u201cEverything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, thanks!\u201d I say, beaming at her.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d says the woman, looking at Erin. \u201cYou\u2019re going to try the knee-length skirt for our customer. Is that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Erin, and gives a rather forced smile. \u201cI\u2019ll just go get it.\u201d</p> <p>As she disappears, I can\u2019t resist sidling over to the rack of clothes, just to see what else she brought. The woman in glasses watches me for a moment, then comes in and holds out her hand.</p><p>\u201cChristina Rowan,\u201d she said. \u201cI head up the personal shopping department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hello!\u201d I say, looking at a pale blue Jill Stuart shirt. \u201cI\u2019m Becky Bloomwood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re from England, I guess, by your accent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLondon, but I\u2019m going to move to New York!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you, indeed.\u201d Christina Rowan gives me a friendly smile. \u201cTell me, what do you do, Becky? Do you work in fashion?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh no. I\u2019m in finance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinance! Really.\u201d She raises her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI give financial advice on the telly. You know, pensions and stuff...\u201d I reach for a pair of soft cashmere trousers. \u201cAren\u2019t these beautiful? Much better than the Ralph Lauren ones. And they\u2019re cheaper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re great, aren\u2019t they?\u201d She gives me a quizzical look. \u201cWell, it\u2019s nice to have such an enthusiastic customer.\u201d She reaches into the pocket of her jacket and pulls out a business card. \u201cDo come back and visit us when you\u2019re here again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will!\u201d I beam at her. \u201cAnd thanks very much!\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s four o\u2019clock by the time I finally leave Barneys. I hail a cab and travel back to the Four Seasons. As I push open the door to our room and look at my reflection in the silent dressing table mirror, I\u2019m still on a kind of glittery high, almost a hysterical excitement at what I\u2019ve just done. What I\u2019ve just bought.</p><p>I know I went out just planning to buy a single outfit for my screen test. But I ended up... Well, I suppose I just got a bit... a bit carried away. So my final list of purchases goes like this:</p><p>1. Moschino jacket2. Knee-length Barneys skirt3. Calvin Klein underwear4. Pair of new tights and...5. Vera Wang cocktail dress.</p> <p>Just... before you say anything, I know I wasn\u2019t supposed to be buying a cocktail dress. I know that when Erin said, \u201cAre you interested in evening wear?\u201d I should simply have said no.</p><p>But oh God. Oh God. That Vera Wang dress. Inky purple, with a low back and glittering straps. It just looked so completely movie-star perfect. Everyone crowded round to see me in it \u2014 and when I drew back the curtain, they all gasped.</p><p>And I just stared at myself, mesmerized. Entranced by what I could look like, by the person I could be. There was no question. I had to have it. I had to. As I signed the credit card slip... I wasn\u2019t me anymore. I was Grace Kelly. I was Gwyneth Paltrow. I was a glittering somebody else, who can casually sign a credit card slip for thousands of dollars while smiling and laughing at the assistant, as though this were a nothing-purchase.</p><p>Thousands of dollars.</p><p>Although, for a designer like Vera Wang, that price is actually quite...</p><p>Well, it\u2019s really very...</p><p>I feel slightly sick. I don\u2019t even want to think about how much it cost. The point is, I\u2019ll be able to wear it for years. Yes! Years and years. And I need designer clothes if I\u2019m going to be a famous television star. I mean, I\u2019ll have important events to go to \u2014 and I can\u2019t just turn up in M&amp;S, can I? Exactly.</p><p>And I\u2019ve got a \u00a310,000 credit card limit. That\u2019s the real point. I mean, they wouldn\u2019t give it to me if they didn\u2019t think I could afford it.</p><p>Suddenly I hear a sound at the door, and quickly rise to my feet. Heart thumping, I go to the wardrobe I\u2019ve been stashing all my shopping in, open the door, and quickly shove my Barneys bags inside \u2014 then close the door and turn round with a smile, just as Luke enters the room, talking on his mobile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m in fucking control,\u201d he\u2019s spitting furiously into the phone. \u201cWhat the fuck do they think they\u2019re\u2014\u201d He breaks off and is silent for a few moments. \u201cI don\u2019t need to fly back to London! Alicia has it all in hand. She says there\u2019s absolutely no problem with Provident Assurance, she spoke to them today and they\u2019re very happy. Someone\u2019s just shit-stirring, God knows who. Yes, I know,\u201d he says in a calmer voice. \u201cYes. OK, will do. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow, Michael. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>He switches off his mobile, puts it away, and looks at me as though he\u2019s almost forgotten who I am. But then his brow softens and he smiles.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d he says, and drops his briefcase onto a chair.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say brightly, moving away from the wardrobe door. \u201cStranger.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d says Luke, rubbing his face wearily. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Things have been... a bit of a nightmare, to be frank. I heard about your screen test, though. Fantastic news.\u201d</p><p>He goes to the minibar, pours himself a scotch, and downs it. Then he pours himself another one and takes a slug while I watch anxiously. His face is pale and tense, I notice, and there are shadows under his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIs it all... going OK?\u201d I ask gingerly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going,\u201d he replies. \u201cThat\u2019s about as much as I can say.\u201d He walks over to the window and stares out over the glittering Manhattan skyline, and I bite my lip nervously.</p><p>\u201cLuke \u2014 couldn\u2019t someone else go to all these meetings? Couldn\u2019t someone else fly out and take some of the load? Like... Alicia?\u201d</p> <p>It nearly kills me even to mention her name \u2014 but I honestly am getting a bit worried. Slightly to my relief, though, Luke shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t bring in somebody new at this stage. I\u2019ve been managing it all until now; I\u2019ll just have to see it through. I just had no idea they\u2019d be so pedantic. I had no idea they\u2019d be so...\u201d He sits down in an armchair and takes a slug of his drink. \u201cI mean, Jesus, they ask a lot of questions. I know Americans are thorough but\u2014\u201d He shakes his head disbelievingly. \u201cThey have to know everything. About every single client, every single potential client, everybody who\u2019s ever worked for the company, every single bloody memo I\u2019ve ever sent... Is there any possibility of litigation here? Who was your receptionist in 1993? What car do you drive? What fucking... toothpaste do you use? And now, with these rumors... they\u2019re picking everything apart all over again.\u201d</p><p>He breaks off and drains his glass, and I stare at him in dismay.</p><p>\u201cThey sound awful!\u201d I say, and the flicker of a smile passes across Luke\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not awful. They\u2019re just very conservative, old-school investors \u2014 and something\u2019s rattling them. I don\u2019t know what.\u201d He exhales sharply. \u201cI just need to keep them steady.\u201d</p><p>His voice is trembling slightly \u2014 and as I glance at his hand I see that it\u2019s clenched tightly around his glass. I\u2019ve never seen Luke like this, to be honest. He usually looks so utterly in control, so completely smooth...</p> <p>\u201cLuke, I think you should have an evening off. You haven\u2019t got a meeting tonight, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Luke, looking up. \u201cBut I need to go through some of these forecasts again. Big meeting tomorrow, with all the investors. I need to be prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are prepared!\u201d I reply. \u201cWhat you need is to be relaxed. If you work all night, you\u2019ll just be tired and tense and ratty.\u201d I go over to him, take his glass out of his hand, and start to massage his shoulders. \u201cCome on, Luke. You really need a night off. I bet Michael would agree. Wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been telling me to lighten up,\u201d admits Luke after a long pause.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, lighten up! Come on, a few hours of fun never did anybody any harm. Let\u2019s both dress up and go somewhere really nice, and dance, and drink cocktails...\u201d I kiss him gently on the back of his neck. \u201cI mean, why on earth come to New York and not enjoy it?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence \u2014 and for an awful moment I think Luke\u2019s going to say he hasn\u2019t got time. But then suddenly he turns round \u2014 and thank God, I can see the faint glimmer of a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he says. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>It turns into the most magical, glamorous, glossy evening of my life. I put on my Vera Wang dress and Luke puts on his smartest suit, and we go to a fabulous restaurant all done like an Art Deco cruise ship, where beautiful people are eating lobster and there\u2019s an old-fashioned jazz band, just like in the movies. Luke orders Bellinis, and we toast each other, and as he relaxes, he tells me more about his deal. In fact, he confides in me more than he ever has before.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis city,\u201d he says, shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s a demanding place.

You fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you don\u2019t make any mistakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou win,\u201d says Luke. \u201cYou win it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to win,\u201d I say confidently. \u201cYou\u2019re going to wow them all tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to wow them at your screen test,\u201d says Luke, as a waiter appears at our table with our first course \u2014 the most amazing sculptures made out of seafood, presented on hexagonal plates. He pours our wine, and Luke lifts his glass in a toast.</p><p>\u201cTo you, Becky. You\u2019re going to be a huge success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re going to be a huge success,\u201d I reply, feeling a glow of pleasure all around me. \u201cWe\u2019re both going to be huge successes!\u201d</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s the Bellini, going to my head \u2014 but suddenly I feel again exactly as I did in Barneys. I\u2019m not the old Becky \u2014 I\u2019m someone new and sparkling. Surreptitiously I glance at myself in a nearby mirror, and feel a twinge of delight. I mean, just look at me! All poised and groomed, in a New York restaurant, wearing a thousands-of-dollars dress, with my wonderful, successful boyfriend \u2014 and a screen test tomorrow for American television!</p><p>I feel completely intoxicated with happiness. This expensive, glossy world is where I\u2019ve been heading all along. Limos and flowers; waxed eyebrows and designer clothes from Barneys; a purse stuffed with business cards of TV executives. These are my people; this is where I\u2019m meant to be. My old life seems a million, zillion miles away, like a tiny dot on the horizon. Mum and Dad and Suze... my untidy room in Fulham... EastEnders with a pizza... I mean, let\u2019s face it. That was never really me, was it?</p> <p>We end up staying out for hours. We dance to the jazz band, eat passion fruit sorbet, and talk about everything in the world but work. Luke asks the band to play \u201cThese Foolish Things,\u201d which is a song I completely love \u2014 and then sings along as we dance (very out of tune, but I don\u2019t say anything). When we get back to the hotel we\u2019re both laughing, and tripping slightly as we walk, and Luke\u2019s hand is making its way deftly inside my dress.</p><p>\u201cMiss Bloomwood?\u201d says the concierge as we pass the desk. \u201cThere\u2019s a message for you to call a Susan Cleath-Stuart, in London. Whatever time you get in. Apparently it\u2019s urgent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d I say, rolling my eyes. \u201cShe\u2019ll just be calling to lecture me about how much I spent on my new dress. \u2018How much? Oh Bex, you shouldn\u2019t have...\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic dress,\u201d says Luke, running his hands appreciatively up and down it. \u201cAlthough there\u2019s far too much of it. You could lose this bit here... and this bit...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like the number?\u201d says the concierge, holding out a piece of paper.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d I say, waving my hand. \u201cI\u2019ll call her tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd please,\u201d adds Luke, \u201chold all calls to our room, until further notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d says the concierge with a twinkle. \u201cGood night, sir. Good night, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>We travel up in the lift, grinning stupidly at each other in the mirrors \u2014 and as we arrive at our room, I realize that I\u2019m really feeling quite drunk. My only consolation is, Luke looks completely plastered, too.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d I say, as the door closes behind us, \u201cwas the best night of my life. The very best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t over yet,\u201d says Luke, coming toward me with a meaningful gleam in his eye. \u201cI feel I need to reward you for your most insightful comments, Miss Bloomwood. You were right. All work and no play...\u201d He starts to pull my Vera Wang straps gently down off my shoulders. \u201cMakes Jack...\u201d he murmurs against my skin. \u201cA very...\u201d</p><p>And suddenly we\u2019re tumbling down onto the bed together, and his mouth is on mine, and my mind is wheeling with alcohol and delight. As he\u2019s pulling off his shirt, I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror. I stare at my intoxicated, happy self for an instant, and hear a voice inside saying: remember this moment forever. Remember this moment, Becky, because right now, life is perfect.</p><p>The rest is a haze of drunken, blurry pleasure, drifting into oblivion. The last thing I remember is Luke kissing me on the eyelids and telling me to sleep well and that he loves me. That\u2019s the last thing.</p><p>And then, like a car crash, it happens.</p> <p>Twelve</p><p>AT FIRST, I don\u2019t realize anything is wrong. I wake up feeling extremely bleary \u2014 to see Luke handing me a cup of tea. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you check the messages?\u201d he says, giving me a kiss, and heads toward the shower. After a few sips of tea, I lift the telephone receiver and press the star button.</p><p>\u201cYou have twenty-three messages,\u201d says the telephone voice \u2014 and I gape at it in astonishment. Twenty-three?</p><p>Perhaps they\u2019re all job offers! is my first thought. Perhaps it\u2019s people calling from Hollywood! In great excitement I press the button to hear the first one. But it\u2019s not a job offer \u2014 it\u2019s Suze \u2014 and she\u2019s sounding really hassled.</p><p>\u201cBex, please ring me. As soon as you get this. It\u2019s... it\u2019s really urgent. Bye.\u201d</p> <p>The voice asks me if I\u2019d like to hear my remaining messages \u2014 and for a moment I hesitate. But Suze did sound pretty desperate \u2014 and I remember with a twinge of guilt that she called last night, too. I dial the number \u2014 and to my surprise, it clicks onto her answer machine.</p><p>\u201cHi! It\u2019s me!\u201d I say as soon as Suze\u2019s voice has finished speaking. \u201cWell, you\u2019re not in, so I hope whatever it is has sorted itself\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex!\u201d Suze\u2019s voice practically bursts my eardrum. \u201cOh my God, Bex, where have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut,\u201d I say puzzledly. \u201cAnd then asleep. Suze, is everything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex, I never said those things!\u201d she interrupts, sounding distressed. \u201cYou have to believe me. I\u2019d never say anything like that. They just... twisted everything round. I told your mum, I didn\u2019t have any idea\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy mum?\u201d I say in puzzlement. \u201cSuze, slow down. What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d says Suze. \u201cBex, haven\u2019t you seen it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeen what?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cThe Daily World,\u201d says Suze. \u201cI... I thought you got all the British papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do,\u201d I say, rubbing my dry face. \u201cBut they\u2019ll still be outside the door. Is there... is there something about me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Suze a little too quickly. \u201cNo. I mean... there is this one very tiny thing. But it\u2019s not worth looking at. I really wouldn\u2019t bother. In fact \u2014 throw The Daily World away, I would. Just... put it in the bin, without even opening it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something nasty, isn\u2019t there?\u201d I say apprehensively. \u201cDo my legs look really fat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really nothing!\u201d says Suze. \u201cNothing! So anyway... have you been to Rockefeller Center yet? It\u2019s supposed to be great! Or FAO Schwarz? Or...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuze, stop,\u201d I interrupt. \u201cI\u2019m going to go and get it. I\u2019ll call you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, look, Bex, just remember,\u201d says Suze in a rush. \u201cHardly anyone reads The Daily World. You know, like about three people. And it\u2019s tomorrow\u2019s fish-and-chips. And everyone knows the newspapers make up complete lies...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, trying to sound relaxed. \u201cI\u2019ll remember that. And don\u2019t worry, Suze! These stupid little things don\u2019t faze me!\u201d</p><p>But as I put the phone down, my hand is trembling slightly. What on earth can they have said about me? I hurry to the door, grab the pile of papers, and cart them all back to the bed. I seize hold of The Daily World and feverishly start to leaf through it. Page after page... but there\u2019s nothing there. I go back to the beginning and leaf through more carefully, looking at all the tiny box items \u2014 and there really is no mention of me at all. I lean back on my pillows, bemused. What on earth is Suze going on about? Why on earth is she so\u2014</p><p>And then I spot the center double-page spread. A single folded sheet, lying on the bed, which must have fallen out as I grabbed hold of the paper. Very slowly I reach for it. I open it. And it\u2019s as though someone\u2019s punched me in the stomach.</p> <p>There\u2019s a picture of me. It\u2019s a photo I don\u2019t recognize \u2014 not very flattering. I\u2019m walking along, in some street... A New York street, I realize with a lurch. And I\u2019m holding lots of shopping bags. And there\u2019s a picture of Luke, in a circle. And a little picture of Suze. And the headline reads...</p><p>I can\u2019t even tell you what it says. I can\u2019t even say it. It\u2019s... it\u2019s too awful.</p><p>It\u2019s a huge article, spanning the whole center spread. As I read it, my heart is thudding; my head feels hot and cold. It\u2019s so nasty. It\u2019s so... personal. Halfway through I can\u2019t stand it anymore. I close the paper, and stare ahead, breathing hard, feeling as though I might throw up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then almost immediately, with trembling hands, I open it again.

I can\u2019t quite believe this is really happening. This paper has already been printed millions of times. It\u2019s too late to stop it. In Britain, I suddenly realize, this has been out for hours. My parents will have seen it. Everyone I know will have seen it. I\u2019m powerless.</p><p>As I\u2019m sitting there, the telephone gives a shrill ring, and I jump with fright. After a moment it rings again, and I stare at it in terror. I can\u2019t answer. I can\u2019t talk to anybody, not even Suze.</p><p>The phone rings for the fourth time, and Luke strides out of the bathroom, a towel round his waist and his hair slicked back.</p> <p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to get that?\u201d he says shortly, and grabs for the receiver. \u201cHello? Yes, Luke Brandon here.\u201d</p><p>I feel a swoop of fear, and wrap the duvet more tightly around me.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Luke is saying. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d He puts the phone down and scribbles something on a pad of paper.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d I say, trying to keep my voice steady.</p><p>\u201cA secretary from JD Slade,\u201d he says, putting his pen down. \u201cChange of venue.\u201d</p> <p>He starts to get dressed, and I say nothing. My hand tightens around the Daily World page. I want to show him... but I don\u2019t want to show him. I don\u2019t want him to read those horrible things about me. But I can\u2019t let him see it from someone else.</p><p>I can\u2019t sit here forever, saying nothing. I close my eyes \u2014 then take a deep breath and say, \u201cLuke, there\u2019s a thing about me in the paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d says Luke absently, doing up his tie. \u201cI thought you might get a bit of publicity. Which paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... it\u2019s not good,\u201d I say, and lick my dry lips. \u201cIt\u2019s really awful.\u201d</p><p>Luke looks at me properly and sees my expression.</p><p>\u201cOh, Becky,\u201d he says, \u201cit can\u2019t be that bad. Come on, show me. What does it say?\u201d He holds out his hand, but I don\u2019t move.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just... really horrible. And there\u2019s a great big picture\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have a bad hair day?\u201d says Luke teasingly, and reaches for his jacket. \u201cBecky, no piece of publicity is ever 100 percent perfect. You\u2019re always going to find something to fret about, whether it\u2019s your hair, or something you said...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke!\u201d I say despairingly. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like that. Just... have a look.\u201d</p><p>Slowly I unfold the paper and give it to Luke. He takes it cheerfully \u2014 but as he gazes at it, his smile slowly disappears.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck\u2014 Is that me?\u201d He glances at me briefly, and I swallow, not daring to say anything. Then he scans the page while I watch nervously.</p><p>\u201cIs this true?\u201d he says at last. \u201cAny of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no!\u201d I stammer. \u201cAt least... not... not all of it. Some of it is...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in debt?\u201d</p> <p>I meet his gaze, feeling my face turn crimson.</p><p>\u201cA... a little bit. But I mean, not like they say... I mean, I don\u2019t know anything about a summons...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTuesday afternoon!\u201d He hits the paper. \u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake. You were at the Guggenheim.

I went... shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went...\u201d He stares at me \u2014 then silently starts to read again.</p><p>When he\u2019s finished he stares ahead expressionlessly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe this,\u201d he says, so quietly I can barely hear him.</p><p>He looks as grim as I feel \u2014 and for the first time this morning I feel tears pricking at my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say shakily. \u201cIt\u2019s awful. They must have been following me. They must have been there all along, watching me, spying on me...\u201d I look at him for a response, but he\u2019s just staring straight ahead. \u201cLuke, don\u2019t you have anything to say? Do you realize\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, do you realize?\u201d he interrupts.

You don\u2019t have to be sorry! It\u2019s those scumbag reporters who should be sorry. Making up all those stories. Putting words in people\u2019s mouths. Poor Suzie phoned us up, very upset.

But I\u2019ll call you later. And... thanks.\u201d</p> <p>As I put down the phone, I feel a million times better. Mum\u2019s right. I\u2019ve just got to be positive and go to my screen test and do as well as I possibly can. And Luke probably did overreact a little bit. He\u2019ll probably come back in a much better mood.</p><p>I ring up the hotel reception and tell them to hold all calls except from HLBC. Then I run my bath, empty a whole bottle of Uplift bath oil from Sephora into it, and wallow for half an hour in rose geranium. As I dry myself I put on MTV and dance around the room to Janet Jackson \u2014 and by the time I\u2019m dressed in my knock-\u2019em-dead outfit from Barneys I\u2019m feeling pretty positive, if a little wobbly around the knees. I can do this. I can.</p><p>They haven\u2019t called yet, so I pick up the phone and ring down to reception.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say. \u201cJust checking if HLBC have called for me this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe so,\u201d says the girl pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? They didn\u2019t leave a message?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>I put the phone down and think for a few moments. Well \u2014 that\u2019s all right, I\u2019ll just call them. I mean, I need to know what time the test is, don\u2019t I? And Kent told me to call her anytime, whatever I needed. She said, don\u2019t even hesitate.</p><p>I take her business card out of my bag and carefully punch in the number.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d says a bright voice. \u201cKent Garland\u2019s office, this is her assistant, Megan. How can I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s Rebecca Bloomwood here. Could I speak to Kent, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKent\u2019s in a meeting right now,\u201d says Megan pleasantly. \u201cCould I take a message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m just phoning to see what time my screen test is today,\u201d I say. And just saying it gives me a surge of confidence. Who cares about the crappy Daily World, anyway? I\u2019m going to be on American television. I\u2019m going to be a huge celebrity.</p> <p>\u201cI see,\u201d says Megan. \u201cRebecca, if you could just hold on a moment...\u201d</p><p>She puts me on hold, and I find myself listening to a tinny version of \u201cHeard It through the Grapevine.\u201d It comes to an end, and a voice tells me how important my call is to the HLBC Corporation... and then it starts again... when suddenly Megan is back.</p><p>\u201cHi, Rebecca? I\u2019m afraid Kent\u2019s going to have to postpone the screen test. She\u2019ll give you a call if she wants to rearrange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say, staring blankly at my made-up face in the mirror. \u201cPostpone? But... why? Do you know when it\u2019ll be rescheduled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d says Megan pleasantly. \u201cKent\u2019s very busy right now with the new series of Consumer Today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut... but that\u2019s what the screen test is for! The new series of Consumer Today!\u201d I take a deep breath, trying not to sound too anxious. \u201cDo you know when she\u2019ll rearrange it for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really couldn\u2019t say. Her diary\u2019s very full at the moment... and then she has a two-week vacation...\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d I say, trying to stay calm. \u201cI\u2019d really like to talk to Kent, please. It\u2019s quite important. Couldn\u2019t you get her for me? Just for a second.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause \u2014 then Megan sighs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see if I can fetch her.\u201d</p><p>The tinny song begins again \u2014 then suddenly Kent is on the line.</p><p>\u201cHi, Becky. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say, trying to sound relaxed. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I just thought I\u2019d see what was happening today. About the screen test?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d says Kent thoughtfully. \u201cTell the truth, Becky, a couple of issues have come up, which we need to think about. OK? So we\u2019ll be passing on the screen test until we\u2019re a little more decided about things.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I feel paralyzed by fear. Oh, please, no.</p><p>She\u2019s seen The Daily World, hasn\u2019t she? That\u2019s what she\u2019s talking about. I clutch the receiver tightly, my heart thudding, desperately wanting to explain it all; wanting to tell her that it all sounds far worse than it really is. That half of it isn\u2019t even true; that it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not good at what I do...</p><p>But I just can\u2019t bring myself to. I can\u2019t bring myself even to mention it.</p> <p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll be in touch,\u201d Kent says. \u201cApologies for putting you out today \u2014 I was going to have Megan call you later...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right!\u201d I say, trying to sound bright and easy. \u201cSo... when do you think we might reschedule?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not sure... Sorry, Becky. I\u2019m going to have to run. There\u2019s a problem on the set. But thanks for calling. And enjoy the rest of your trip!\u201d</p><p>The phone goes silent and I slowly put it down.</p><p>I\u2019m not having my screen test. They don\u2019t want me, after all.</p> <p>And I bought a new outfit and everything.</p><p>I can feel my breath coming quicker and quicker \u2014 and for an awful moment I think I might cry.</p><p>But then I think of Mum \u2014 and force myself to lift my chin. I\u2019m not going to let myself collapse. I\u2019m going to be strong and positive. HLBC aren\u2019t the only fish in the sea. There are plenty of other people who want to snap me up. Plenty! I mean, look at... look at Greg Walters. He said he wanted me to meet his head of development, didn\u2019t he? Well, maybe we can fix something up for today. Yes! Perhaps by the end of today, I\u2019ll have my own show!</p><p>Quickly I find the number and dial it with trembling hands \u2014 and to my joy, I get straight through. This is more like it. Straight to the top.</p><p>\u201cHi, Greg? It\u2019s Becky Bloomwood here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky! Great to hear from you!\u201d says Greg, sounding a little distracted. \u201cHow\u2019re you doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cErm... fine! It was really nice to meet you yesterday,\u201d I say, aware that my voice is shrill with nerves. \u201cAnd I was very interested in all your ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s great! So \u2014 are you enjoying your trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Yes, I am.\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cGreg, you were saying yesterday that I should meet up with your head of development\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d says Greg. \u201cI know Dave would adore to meet you. We both think you have huge potential. Huge.\u201d</p><p>Relief floods over me. Thank God. Thank\u2014</p><p>\u201cSo next time you\u2019re in town,\u201d Greg is saying, \u201cyou give me a call, and we\u2019ll set something up.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the phone, prickly with shock. Next time I\u2019m in town? But that could be months. It could be never. Doesn\u2019t he want to\u2014</p><p>\u201cPromise you\u2019ll do that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cErm... OK,\u201d I say, trying to keep the thickening dismay out of my voice. \u201cThat would be great!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe we\u2019ll meet up when I next come over to London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK!\u201d I say brightly. \u201cI hope so. Well... see you soon. And good to meet you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat to meet you too, Becky!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m still smiling my bright fake smile as the phone goes dead. And this time I just can\u2019t stop the tears from gathering in my eyes and dripping slowly down my face, taking my makeup with them.</p><p>I sit alone in the hotel room for hours. Lunchtime comes and goes, but I can\u2019t face any food. The only positive thing I do is listen to the messages on the phone and delete them all except one from Mum, which I listen to over and over again. It\u2019s the one she must have left as soon as she got The Daily World.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she\u2019s saying. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of fuss here over a silly article in the paper. Don\u2019t take any notice of it, Becky. Just remember, that picture will be going in a million dog baskets tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>For some reason that makes me laugh each time I hear it. So I sit there, half-crying, half-laughing, letting a pool of wet tears gather on my skirt and not even bothering to wipe it away.</p><p>I want to go home. For what seems like an eternity I sit on the floor, rocking backward and forward, letting my thoughts circle round and round. Going over the same ground over and over again. How could I have been so stupid? What am I going to do now? How can I face anyone, ever again?</p><p>I feel as though I\u2019ve been on a crazy roller coaster ever since I got to New York. Like some sort of magical Disney ride \u2014 except instead of whizzing through space, I\u2019ve been whizzing through shops and hotels and interviews and lunches, surrounded by light and glitter and voices telling me I\u2019m the next big thing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And I believed every moment of it. I had no idea it wasn\u2019t real.</p><p>When, at long last, I hear the door opening, I feel almost sick with relief. I have a desperate urge to go and throw myself into Luke\u2019s arms, burst into tears, and listen to him tell me it\u2019s all right. But as he comes in, I feel my whole body contract in fear. His expression is taut and set; he looks as though his face is carved out of stone.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say at last. \u201cI... I wondered where you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had lunch with Michael,\u201d says Luke shortly. \u201cAfter the meeting.\u201d He takes off his coat and puts it carefully onto a hanger while I watch fearfully.</p> <p>\u201cSo...\u201d I hardly dare ask the question. \u201cDid it go well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly well, no.\u201d</p><p>My stomach gives a nervous flip. What does that mean? Surely... surely it can\u2019t be...</p><p>\u201cIs it... off?\u201d I manage at last.</p><p>\u201cGood question,\u201d says Luke. \u201cThe people from JD Slade say they need more time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy do they need time?\u201d I say, licking my dry lips.</p><p>\u201cThey have a few reservations,\u201d says Luke evenly. \u201cThey didn\u2019t specify exactly what those reservations were.\u201d</p><p>He pulls off his tie roughly and starts to unbutton his shirt. He\u2019s not even looking at me. It\u2019s as though he can\u2019t bring himself to see my face.</p><p>\u201cDo you...\u201d I swallow. \u201cDo you think they\u2019d seen the piece?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think so,\u201d says Luke. There\u2019s an edge to his voice which makes me flinch. \u201cYes, I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019d seen it.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s fumbling over the last shirt button. Suddenly, in irritation, he rips it off.</p> <p>\u201cLuke,\u201d I say helplessly. \u201cI\u2019m... I\u2019m so sorry. I... I don\u2019t know what I can do.\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing,\u201d says Luke flatly.</p><p>He heads into the bathroom and after a few moments I hear the sound of the shower. I don\u2019t move. I can\u2019t even think. I feel paralyzed, as though I\u2019m crouching on a ledge, trying not to slip.</p><p>Eventually Luke comes out and, without even acknowledging me, pulls on a pair of black jeans and a black turtleneck. He pours himself a drink and there\u2019s silence. Outside the window I can see right across Manhattan. The air is turning dusky and lights are coming on in windows everywhere, right into the distance. But I feel as though the world has shrunk to this room, these four walls. I haven\u2019t been out all day, I abruptly realize.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have my screen test, either,\u201d I say at last.</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d Luke\u2019s voice is flat and uninterested, and in spite of myself, I feel a faint spark of resentment.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you even want to know why?\u201d I say, tugging at the fringe of a cushion.</p><p>There\u2019s a pause \u2014 then Luke says, as though with tremendous effort, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause no one\u2019s interested in me anymore.\u201d I push my hair back off my head. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s had a bad day, Luke. I\u2019ve wrecked all my chances. No one wants to know me anymore.\u201d</p><p>Humiliation creeps over me as I remember all the telephone messages I had to listen to this morning, politely canceling meetings and calling off lunches.</p><p>\u201cAnd I know it\u2019s all my own fault,\u201d I continue. \u201cI know that. But even so...\u201d My voice starts to wobble treacherously, and I take a deep breath. \u201cThings really aren\u2019t great for me either.\u201d I look up \u2014 but Luke hasn\u2019t moved an inch. \u201cYou could... you could show a little sympathy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow a little sympathy,\u201d echoes Luke evenly.</p><p>\u201cI know I brought it on myself...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! You did!\u201d Luke\u2019s voice explodes in pent-up frustration, and at last he turns to face me. \u201cBecky, no one forced you to go and spend that money! I mean, I know you like shopping. But for Christ\u2019s sake. To spend like this... It\u2019s bloody irresponsible. Couldn\u2019t you have stopped yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d I retort shakily. \u201cProbably. But I didn\u2019t know it was going to become such a... a bloody life-and-death issue, did I? I didn\u2019t know I was being followed, Luke. I didn\u2019t do this on purpose.\u201d To my horror, I feel a tear making its way down my cheek. \u201cYou know, I didn\u2019t hurt anybody. I didn\u2019t kill anybody. Maybe I was a bit naive...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit naive. That\u2019s the understatement of the year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, so I was naive! But I didn\u2019t commit any crime\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think throwing away opportunity is a crime?\u201d says Luke furiously. \u201cBecause as far as I\u2019m concerned...\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cJesus, Becky! We both had it all. We had New York.\u201d His hand clenches into a fist. \u201cAnd now, look at us both. All because you\u2019re so bloody obsessed by shopping\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cObsessed?\u201d I cry. Suddenly I can\u2019t stand his accusing gaze anymore. \u201cI\u2019m obsessed? What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he says dismissively.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re obsessed by work! By making it in New York! The first thing you thought of when you saw that piece wasn\u2019t me or... or how I was feeling, was it? It was how it affected you and your deal.\u201d My voice rises tremulously. \u201cAll you care about is your own success, and I always come second. I mean, you didn\u2019t even bother to tell me about New York until it was all decided! You just expected me to... to fall in line and do exactly what you wanted. No wonder Alicia said I was tagging along!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not tagging along,\u201d he says impatiently.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am! That\u2019s the way you see me, isn\u2019t it? As some little nobody, who has to be... to be slotted into your grand magnificent plan. And I was so stupid, I just went along with it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t got time for this,\u201d says Luke, standing up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never got time!\u201d I say tearfully. \u201cSuze has got more time for me than you have! You didn\u2019t have time to come to Tom\u2019s wedding; our holiday turned into a meeting; you didn\u2019t have time to visit my parents...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I don\u2019t have a lot of time!\u201d yells Luke suddenly, shocking me into silence. \u201cSo I can\u2019t sit around making mindless tittle-tattle with you and Suze.\u201d He shakes his head in frustration. \u201cDo you realize how fucking hard I work? Do you have any idea how important this deal is?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy is it important?\u201d I hear myself shrieking. \u201cWhy is it so bloody important to make it in America? So you can impress your complete cow of a mother? Because if you\u2019re trying to impress her, Luke, then I\u2019d give up now! She\u2019ll never be impressed. Never! I mean, she hasn\u2019t even bothered to see you! God, you buy her an Herm`es scarf \u2014 and she can\u2019t even rearrange her schedule to find five minutes for you!\u201d</p><p>I break off, panting, into complete silence.</p><p>Oh fuck. I shouldn\u2019t have said that.</p><p>I dart a look at Luke, and he\u2019s staring at me, his face ashen with anger.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you call my mother?\u201d he says slowly.</p><p>\u201cLook, I... I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d I swallow, trying to keep control of my voice. \u201cI just think... there\u2019s got to be a sense of proportion in all this. All I did was a bit of shopping...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA bit of shopping,\u201d echoes Luke scathingly. \u201cA bit of shopping.\u201d He gives me a long look \u2014 then, to my horror, heads to the huge cedar-wood wardrobe where I\u2019ve been stashing all my stuff. He opens it silently and we both stare at the bags crammed to the ceiling.</p><p>And as I see it all, I feel a slight nausea overcoming me. All those things which seemed so vital when I bought them, all those things which I got so excited about... now just look like a great big pile of rubbish bags. I could barely even tell you what\u2019s in any of the packages. It\u2019s just... stuff. Piles and piles of stuff.</p><p>Without saying anything, Luke closes the door again, and I feel shame drenching over me like hot water.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say, in a voice barely above a whisper. \u201cI know. But I\u2019m paying for it. I really am.\u201d</p><p>I turn away, unable to meet his eye, and suddenly I just have to get out of this room. I have to get away from Luke, from myself in the mirror, from the whole horrendous day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll... I\u2019ll see you later,\u201d I mutter and without looking back, head for the door.</p><p>The bar downstairs is dimly lit, soothing, and anonymous. I sink into a sumptuous leather chair, feeling weak and achy, as though I\u2019ve got the flu. When a waiter comes up, I order an orange juice, then, as he\u2019s walking away, change my order to a brandy. It arrives in a huge glass, warm and reviving, and I take a few sips \u2014 then look up as a shadow appears on the table in front of me. It\u2019s Michael Ellis. I feel my heart sink. I really don\u2019t feel up to talking.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he says. \u201cMay I?\u201d He gestures to the chair opposite and I nod weakly. He sits down and gives me a kind look as I drain my glass. For a while, we\u2019re both silent.</p> <p>\u201cI could be polite, and not mention it,\u201d he says at last. \u201cOr I could tell you the truth \u2014 which is that I was very sorry for you this morning.

They\u2019re all saying they\u2019ve \u2018decided to go another way\u2019 or they \u2018feel I don\u2019t really suit the American market\u2019 and... you know. Basically just, \u2018Go away.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>As I talk, I can feel my eyes filling up with hot tears. I so wanted to tell all this to Luke. I wanted to pour out all my woes \u2014 and for him to give me a huge, uncritical hug. Tell me it was their loss, not mine, like my parents would, or Suze would. But instead, he made me feel even worse about myself. He\u2019s right \u2014 I\u2019ve thrown everything away, haven\u2019t I? I had opportunities people would kill for, and I wasted them.</p><p>Michael is nodding gravely.</p><p>\u201cThat happens,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m afraid these idiots are like a pack of sheep. One gets spooked, they all get spooked.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just feel like I\u2019ve wrecked everything,\u201d I say, feeling my throat tightening. \u201cI was going to get this amazing job, and Luke was going to be this huge success. It was all going to be perfect. And I\u2019ve just chucked it all in the bin. It\u2019s all my fault.\u201d</p><p>To my horror, tears are spilling out of my eyes. I can\u2019t stop them. And suddenly I give a huge sob. Oh, this is so embarrassing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whisper. \u201cI\u2019m just a complete disaster.\u201d</p><p>I bury my hot face in my hands and hope that Michael Ellis will tactfully slip away and leave me alone. Instead, I feel a hand on mine, and a handkerchief being slipped into my fingers. I wipe my face gratefully with the cool cotton and eventually raise my head.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I gulp. \u201cSorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite all right,\u201d says Michael calmly. \u201cI\u2019d be the same.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cYou should see me when I lose a contract. I bawl my eyes out. My secretary has to run out for Kleenex every half hour.\u201d He sounds so completely deadpan, I can\u2019t help giving a little smile. \u201cNow, drink your brandy,\u201d he says, \u201cand let\u2019s get a few things straight. Did you invite The Daily World to take pictures of you with a long-range lens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you call them, offering an exclusive on your personal habits and suggesting a choice of offensive headlines?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I can\u2019t help giving a half-giggle.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d He gives me a quizzical look. \u201cThis would be all your fault because...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was naive. I should have realized. I should have... seen it coming. I was stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were unlucky.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cMaybe a little foolish. But you can\u2019t heap all the blame on yourself.\u201d</p> <p>An electronic burble sounds from his pocket, and he reaches for his mobile.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me a moment,\u201d he says, and turns away. \u201cHi there.\u201d</p><p>As he talks quietly into the phone I fold a paper coaster over and over. I want to ask him something \u2014 but I\u2019m not sure I want to hear the answer.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d says Michael. As he puts his phone away he gives me a rueful smile and shakes his head. \u201cNever do business with friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Was that a friend?\u201d</p><p>Michael nods. \u201cAn old friend of the family. I did a campaign for him on credit as a favor. He promised when business picked up, he\u2019d write a check. Well, as far as I\u2019m concerned, business has picked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he hasn\u2019t paid you?\u201d I take a sip of my drink, grateful to have something to distract me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s bought himself a nice new Mercedes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrible!\u201d I exclaim.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what friends are for. To exploit the shit out of you. I should have learned that by now.\u201d He rolls his eyes humorously, but I\u2019m still frowning.</p><p>\u201cDo you know his family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. We used to spend Thanksgiving together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I think for a moment. \u201cSo \u2014 have you mentioned this to his wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis wife?\u201d Michael looks surprised, and I raise my eyebrows knowingly at him.</p><p>\u201cI bet you if you told his wife, you\u2019d get the money back.\u201d</p><p>Michael stares at me for a second \u2014 then bursts into laughter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know, I think you have something there. I\u2019ll try it!\u201d He drains his glass, then glances down at the mangled coaster in my fingers. \u201cSo. Are you feeling better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Thanks. But there\u2019s something I wanted to\u2014\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cMichael, was it my fault that Luke\u2019s deal fell through? I mean, did the Daily World thing come into it?\u201d</p><p>He gives me a sharp look. \u201cWe\u2019re being frank here, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, feeling a shaft of apprehension. \u201cWe\u2019re being frank.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen, to be honest, I can\u2019t say it helped proceedings,\u201d says Michael. \u201cThere were various... remarks made this morning. Some oh-so-funny jokes. I have to hand it to Luke, he took it all pretty well.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, feeling cold.</p><p>\u201cLuke didn\u2019t tell me that.\u201d</p><p>Michael shrugs. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought he particularly wanted to repeat any of the comments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it was my fault.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-uh.\u201d Michael shakes his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I said.\u201d He leans back in his chair. \u201cBecky, if this deal had been really strong, it would have survived a bit of adverse publicity. My guess is JD Slade used your little... embarrassment as an excuse. There\u2019s some bigger reason, which they\u2019re keeping to themselves...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows? The rumor about Bank of London? A difference in business ethos? For some reason, they seem to have suffered a general loss of confidence in the whole idea.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, remembering what Luke said.</p><p>\u201cDo people really think Luke\u2019s losing his touch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke is a very talented individual,\u201d says Michael carefully. \u201cBut something\u2019s gotten into him over this deal. He\u2019s almost too driven. I told him this morning, he needs to prioritize. There\u2019s obviously a situation with Bank of London. He should be talking to them. Reassuring them. Frankly, if he loses them, he\u2019s in big trouble. And it\u2019s not just them. Some problem or other seems to have cropped up with Provident Assurance \u2014 another huge client.\u201d He leans forward. \u201cIf you ask me, he should be on a plane back to London this afternoon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what does he want to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already setting up meetings with every New York investment bank I\u2019ve ever heard of.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cThat boy seems fixated by making it in America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he wants to prove something,\u201d I mutter. To his mother, I nearly add.</p><p>\u201cSo Becky...\u201d Michael gives me a kind look. \u201cWhat are you going to do? Try to set up some more meetings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo will you stay out here with Luke?\u201d</p><p>An image of Luke\u2019s frozen face flashes through my mind, and I feel a stab of pain.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much point doing that, either.\u201d I take a deep swig of wine and try to smile. \u201cYou know what? I think I\u2019m just going to go home.\u201d</p> <p>Thirteen</p><p>I GET OUT OF THE TAXI, hoist my suitcase onto the pavement, and look miserably up at the gray English sky. It\u2019s really all over.</p><p>Until the very last minute, I had a secret, desperate hope that someone might change their mind and offer me a job. Or that Luke might beg me to stay. Every time the phone rang I felt jittery, hoping that somehow a miracle was about to happen. But nothing happened. Of course it didn\u2019t.</p><p>When I said good-bye to Luke it was as though I were acting a part. I wanted to throw myself on him in tears, slap his face, something. But I just couldn\u2019t. I had to salvage some kind of dignity, somewhere. So it was almost businesslike, the way I phoned the airline, packed up my stuff, and ordered a cab. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to kiss him on the mouth when I left, so I gave him two brisk pecks on each cheek and then turned away before either of us could say anything.</p><p>Now, twelve hours later, I feel completely exhausted. I sat awake all through the overnight flight, stiff with misery and disappointment. Only a few days ago I was flying out, thinking I was about to start a fantastic new life in America, and instead, I\u2019m back here with less than I even started with. And everyone, but everyone, knows it. A couple of girls at the airport obviously recognized me, and started whispering and giggling as I was waiting for my bags.</p><p>And oh God, I know I\u2019d have been just the same if I\u2019d been them. But right then, I felt so raw with humiliation, I nearly burst into tears.</p><p>I lug my bags dejectedly up the steps and let myself into the flat. And for a few moments I just stand there, looking around at the coats and old letters and keys in the bowl. Same old hall. Same old life. Back to square one. I catch sight of my haggard reflection in the mirror and quickly look away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi!\u201d I call. \u201cAnyone in? I\u2019m back.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause \u2014 then Suze appears at her door in a dressing gown. \u201cBex?\u201d she exclaims. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you back so early! Are you all right?\u201d She comes nearer, pulling her dressing gown around her, and peers worriedly at my face. \u201cOh, Bex.\u201d She bites her lip. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Honestly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally. I\u2019m fine.\u201d I turn away before the sight of Suze\u2019s anxious face reduces me to tears, and scrabble in my bag. \u201cSo anyway... I got you that Clinique stuff you asked for... and the special face stuff for your mum...\u201d I hand the bottles to her and begin to root roughly around again. \u201cThere\u2019s some more stuff for you in here somewhere...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex \u2014 don\u2019t worry about it. Just come and sit down, or something.\u201d Suze clutches the Clinique bottles to her and peers at me uncertainly. \u201cWould you like a drink or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I make myself smile. \u201cI\u2019m all right, Suze! I\u2019ve decided the best thing is just to get on, and not think about what\u2019s happened. In fact \u2014 I\u2019d rather we didn\u2019t talk about it at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d says Suze. \u201cWell... OK. If you\u2019re sure that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I want.\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cReally. I\u2019m fine. So, how are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m OK,\u201d says Suze, and gives me another anxious look. \u201cBex, you look really pale. Have you eaten anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAirplane food. You know.\u201d I take off my coat with trembling fingers and hang it on a peg.</p><p>\u201cWas the... the flight OK?\u201d says Suze.</p><p>\u201cIt was great!\u201d I say with a forced brightness. \u201cThey were showing the new Billy Crystal film.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBilly Crystal!\u201d says Suze. She gives me a hesitant glance, as though I\u2019m some psychotic patient who has to be handled carefully. \u201cWas it a... a good film? I love Billy Crystal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was. It was a good film. I was really enjoying it, actually.\u201d I swallow hard. \u201cUntil my earphones stopped working in the middle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh dear!\u201d says Suze.</p><p>\u201cIt was a really crucial bit. Everyone else on the plane was laughing away \u2014 and I couldn\u2019t hear anything.\u201d My voice starts to wobble treacherously. \u201cSo I... I asked this stewardess if I could have some new earphones. But she didn\u2019t understand what I meant, and she got really ratty with me because she was trying to serve drinks... And then I didn\u2019t want to ask her again. So I don\u2019t quite know how the film finished. But apart from that, it was really good...\u201d Suddenly I give a huge sob. \u201cAnd you know, I can always rent it on video or something...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex!\u201d Suze\u2019s face crumples in dismay and she drops the Clinique bottles on the floor. \u201cOh God, Bex. Come here.\u201d She envelops me in a hug, and I bury my head in her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s all awful,\u201d I weep. \u201cIt was just so humiliating, Suze. Luke was so cross... and they canceled my screen test... and suddenly it was like... like I had some infectious disease or something. And now nobody wants to know me, and I\u2019m not going to move to New York after all...\u201d</p><p>I look up, wiping my eyes \u2014 and Suze\u2019s face is all pink and distressed.</p><p>\u201cBex, I feel so bad,\u201d she exclaims.</p><p>\u201cYou feel bad? Why should you feel bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all my fault. I was such a moron! I let that girl from the paper in here, and she probably poked about when I was making her cup of stupid coffee. I mean, why did I have to offer her coffee? It\u2019s all my stupid fault.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you ever forgive me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I ever forgive you?\u201d I stare at her, my face quivering. \u201cSuze... I should be asking you to forgive me! You tried to keep tabs on me. You tried to warn me, but I didn\u2019t even bother to call you back... I was just so... stupid, so thoughtless...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you weren\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d I give another huge sob. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what happened to me in New York. I went mad. Just... the shops... all these meetings... I was going to be this huge star and earn loads of money... And then it all just disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Bex!\u201d Suze is practically crying herself. \u201cI feel so terrible!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault!\u201d I reach for a tissue and blow my nose. \u201cIf it\u2019s anyone\u2019s fault, it\u2019s The Daily World\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate them!\u201d says Suze savagely. \u201cThey should be strung up and flogged. That\u2019s what Tarkie said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cSo... he... he saw it, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, Bex \u2014 I think most people saw it,\u201d says Suze reluctantly.</p> <p>I feel a painful lurch as I think about Janice and Martin reading it.

All the people I\u2019ve ever known, reading my most humiliating secrets.</p><p>\u201cLook, come on,\u201d says Suze. \u201cLeave all your stuff.

And I said he was obsessed with work... and I... I said his mother was a... a complete cow...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called his mother a cow?\u201d Suze looks so taken aback, I give a shaky giggle.</p><p>\u201cWell, she is! She\u2019s awful. And she doesn\u2019t even love Luke. But he can\u2019t see it... all he wants is to land the biggest deal in the world and impress her. He can\u2019t think about anything else but that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what happened then?\u201d says Suze, handing me a mug of tea.</p><p>I bite my lip, remembering that last painful conversation we had, while I was waiting for my taxi to take me to the airport. The polite stilted voices, the way we didn\u2019t look each other in the eye.</p><p>\u201cBefore I left, I said I didn\u2019t think he had time for a proper relationship at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Suze\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cYou called it off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d My voice is barely above a whisper. \u201cI wanted him to say he did have time. But he didn\u2019t say anything. It was... awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Bex.\u201d Suze stares at me over her mug. \u201cOh, Bex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, never mind,\u201d I say, trying to sound upbeat. \u201cIt\u2019s probably all for the best.\u201d I take a sip of tea and close my eyes. \u201cOh God, that\u2019s good. That\u2019s so good.\u201d For a while I\u2019m silent, letting the steam warm my face, feeling myself relax. I take a few more sips, then open my eyes. \u201cThey just cannot make tea in America. I went to one place, and they gave me this... cup full of hot water, and a tea bag in a packet. And the cup was see-through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh.\u201d Suze pulls a face. \u201cYuck.\u201d She reaches for the tin of biscuits and takes out a couple of Hobnobs. \u201cWho needs America, anyway?\u201d she says robustly. \u201cI mean, everyone knows American TV is rubbish. You\u2019re better off here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe I am.\u201d I stare into my mug for a while, then take a deep breath and look up. \u201cYou know, I thought a lot on the plane. I decided I\u2019m going to make this a real turning point in my life. I\u2019m going to concentrate on my career, and finish my book, and be really focused \u2014 and just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow them,\u201d finishes Suze.</p><p>\u201cExactly. Just show them.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s amazing what a bit of home comfort does for the spirit. Half an hour and three cups of tea later, I\u2019m feeling a million times better. I\u2019m even quite enjoying telling Suze about New York, and all the things I did.

So, what did Luke\u2019s mum say? Did she want to see the results?\u201d And she starts gurgling with laughter again.</p><p>\u201cHang on, I\u2019ll just get a couple,\u201d I say, and start to head toward Suze\u2019s room, where they\u2019re kept.</p><p>\u201cActually\u2014\u201d says Suze, and her laughter abruptly stops. \u201cNo, don\u2019t go in there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I say, stopping in surprise. \u201cWhat\u2019s in your...\u201d I tail off as Suze\u2019s cheeks slowly turn pink. \u201cSuze!\u201d I say, backing quietly away from the door. \u201cNo. Is there someone in there?\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, and she pulls her dressing gown around her defensively, without saying anything.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it!\u201d My voice squeaks incredulously. \u201cI go away for five minutes and you start having a torrid affair!\u201d</p><p>This is cheering me up more than anything else.

OK,\u201d says Tarquin, a little stiltedly. \u201cMorning, Becky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning!\u201d I say. \u201cNice to... to see you.

But my mouth is twitching and I can feel a strange pressure rising inside me \u2014 half shock, half hysterical laughter. I mean, Tarquin. Tarquin!</p><p>A sudden giggle escapes from me and I clamp my hand over my mouth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t laugh!\u201d wails Suze. \u201cI knew you\u2019d laugh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not laughing!\u201d I protest. \u201cI think it\u2019s great!\u201d I give another snort of laughter, and try to pretend I\u2019m coughing. \u201cSorry! Sorry. So \u2014 how did it happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was at that party in Scotland!\u201d she wails. \u201cThere was no one else there except loads of ancient aunts. Tarquin was the only other person under ninety. And somehow... he looked all different! He had on this really nice Paul Smith jersey, and his hair looked kind of cool \u2014 and it was like, is that really Tarquin? And I got quite pissed \u2014 and you know what that does to me. And there he was...\u201d She shakes her head helplessly. \u201cI don\u2019t know. He was just... transformed.

Last night was the very last time. We\u2019re both completely agreed. It\u2019ll never happen again. Never.

In fact\u2014\u201d I say, having a sudden idea. \u201cI\u2019ve got something for you.\u201d</p> <p>I hurry into the hall, open one of my suitcases, and scrabble for the Kate\u2019s Paperie carrier bag. I pluck a card from the pile, scribble \u201cTo Suze, love Bex\u201d inside, and return to the kitchen, sealing the envelope.</p><p>\u201cIs this for me?\u201d says Suze in surprise. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen it!\u201d</p><p>She tears it open, looks at the picture of a zipped-up pair of lips, and reads aloud the printed message:</p><p>Roomie \u2014 your secret\u2019s safe with me.</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d she says, wide-eyed. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool! Did you buy it especially? But I mean...\u201d She frowns. \u201cHow did you know I\u2019d have a secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... just a hunch,\u201d I say. \u201cYou know. Sixth sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, Bex, that reminds me,\u201d says Suze, flipping the envelope back and forth in her fingers. \u201cYou got quite a lot of post while you were away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh right.\u201d</p><p>In the astonishment of hearing about Suze and Tarquin, I\u2019d kind of forgotten about everything else. But now the hysteria which has been lifting my spirits starts to evaporate. As Suze brings over a pile of unfriendly-looking envelopes, my stomach gives a nasty flip, and I suddenly wish I\u2019d never come home. At least while I was away, I didn\u2019t have to know about any of this.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, trying to sound nonchalant and on top of things. I leaf through the letters without really looking at them \u2014 then put them down. \u201cI\u2019ll look at them later. When I can give them my full attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex...\u201d Suze pulls a face. \u201cI think you\u2019d better open this one now.\u201d She reaches for the pile and pulls out a brown envelope with the word SUMMONS on the front.</p><p>I stare at it, feeling mortified. A summons. It was true. I\u2019ve been summonsed. I take the envelope from Suze, unable to meet her eye, and rip it open with trembling fingers. I scan the letter without saying anything, feeling a growing coldness at the base of my spine. I can\u2019t quite believe people would actually take me to court. I mean, court is for criminals. Like drug dealers and murderers. Not for people who just miss a couple of bills.</p><p>I stuff the letter back into its envelope and put it on the counter, breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cBex... what are you going to do?\u201d says Suze, biting her lip. \u201cYou can\u2019t just ignore that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.

He can easily afford it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say, more sharply than I\u2019d intended. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want any help.

I\u2019m going to be independent and strong, and stand on my own two feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you, Bex!\u201d says Suze. \u201cThat\u2019s really fantastic. Independent and strong. That\u2019s really great!\u201d She watches as I try to open my suitcase with shaking fingers. As I struggle with the clasp for the third time, she comes over and puts a hand on my arm. \u201cBex \u2014 would you like me to come too?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d I say in a small voice.</p><p>Suze won\u2019t let me go anywhere until I\u2019ve sat down and had a couple of brandies for Dutch courage. Then she tells me how she read an article the other day that said your best negotiating weapon is your appearance \u2014 so I must choose my outfit for seeing John Gavin very carefully. We go right through my wardrobe and end up with a plain black skirt and gray cardigan which I reckon shouts \u201cfrugal, sober, and steady.\u201d Then she has to choose her own \u201csensible, supportive friend\u201d outfit (navy trousers and a white shirt). And we\u2019re almost ready to go when Suze decides that if nothing else works, we might have to flirt outrageously with him, so we both change into sexy underwear. Then I look at myself in the mirror and suddenly decide I look too drab. So I quickly change into a pale pink cardigan, which means changing my lipstick.</p><p>At last we get out of the house and arrive at the Fulham branch of Endwich Bank. As we go in, Derek Smeath\u2019s old assistant, Erica Parnell, is showing out a middle-aged couple. Between you and me, she and I have never exactly got on. I don\u2019t think she can be quite human \u2014 she\u2019s been wearing exactly the same navy blue shoes every time I\u2019ve seen her.</p><p>\u201cOh, hello,\u201d she says, shooting me a look of dislike. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see John Gavin, please,\u201d I say, trying to sound matter-of-fact. \u201cIs he available?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t think so,\u201d she says coldly. \u201cNot without notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... could you possibly just check?\u201d</p><p>Erica Parnell rolls her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWait there,\u201d she says and disappears behind a door marked \u201cPrivate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, they\u2019re horrible here!\u201d says Suze, lolling against a glass partition. \u201cWhen I go to see my bank manager he gives me a glass of sherry and asks me about all the family! You know, Bex, I really think you should move to Coutts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well,\u201d I say. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m feeling slightly jittery as I leaf through a pile of insurance brochures. I\u2019m remembering what Derek Smeath said about John Gavin being rigorous and inflexible. Oh God, I miss old Smeathie.</p><p>Oh God, I miss Luke.</p><p>The feeling hits me like a hammer blow. Since I got back from New York I\u2019ve been trying not to think about him at all. But as I stand here, all I wish is that I could talk to him. I wish I could see him looking at me like he used to before everything went wrong. With that quizzical little smile on his face, and his arms wrapped tightly around me.</p><p>I wonder what he\u2019s doing now. I wonder how his meetings are going.</p><p>\u201cCome this way,\u201d comes Erica Parnell\u2019s voice, and my head jerks up. Feeling slightly sick, I follow her down a blue-carpeted corridor, into a chilly little room furnished with a table and plastic chairs. As the door closes behind her, Suze and I look at each other.</p><p>\u201cShall we run away?\u201d I say, only half-joking.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine!\u201d says Suze. \u201cHe\u2019ll probably turn out to be really nice! You know, my parents once had this gardener, and he seemed really grumpy \u2014 but then we found out he had a pet rabbit! And it was like, he was a completely different\u2014\u201d</p><p>She breaks off as the door swings open and in strides a guy of about thirty. He\u2019s got thinning dark hair, is wearing a rather nasty suit, and is holding a plastic cup of coffee.</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t look as though he\u2019s got a friendly bone in his body. Suddenly I wish we hadn\u2019t come.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he says with a frown. \u201cI haven\u2019t got all day. Which of you is Rebecca Bloomwood?\u201d</p><p>The way he says it, it\u2019s like he\u2019s asking which one of us threw up on the carpet.</p><p>\u201cErm... I am,\u201d I say nervously.</p><p>\u201cAnd who\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuze is my\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPeople,\u201d says Suze confidently. \u201cI\u2019m her people.\u201d She looks around the room. \u201cDo you have any sherry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says John Gavin, looking at her as though she\u2019s subnormal. \u201cI don\u2019t have any sherry. Now what\u2019s this about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, first of all,\u201d I say nervously, \u201cI\u2019ve brought you something.\u201d I reach into my bag and hand him another Kate\u2019s Paperie envelope.</p><p>It was my own idea to bring him a little something to break the ice.

And in Japan, this is how business is done all the time.</p> <p>\u201cIs this a check?\u201d says John Gavin.</p><p>\u201cErm... no,\u201d I say, coloring slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s a... a handmade card.\u201d</p><p>John Gavin gives me a look, then rips the envelope open and pulls out a card printed in silver, with pink feathers glued to the corners.</p><p>Now that I look at it, maybe I should have chosen a less girly one.</p><p>Or not brought one at all. But it seemed so perfect for the occasion.</p> <p>Friend \u2014 I know I\u2019ve made mistakes, but can we start over?</p><p>John Gavin reads incredulously. He turns it over, as though suspecting a joke. \u201cDid you buy this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice, isn\u2019t it!\u201d says Suze. \u201cYou get them in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. I\u2019ll bear that in mind.\u201d He puts it up on the table and we all look at it. \u201cMiss Bloomwood, why exactly are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d I say. \u201cWell. As my greeting card states, I\u2019m aware that I have...\u201d I swallow. \u201cPerhaps not been the perfect... ideal customer. However, I\u2019m confident that we can work together as a team, and achieve harmony.\u201d</p><p>So far so good. I learned that bit off by heart.</p> <p>\u201cWhich means?\u201d says John Gavin.</p><p>I clear my throat. \u201cUm... due to circumstances beyond my control, I have recently found myself in a slight financial... situation. So I was wondering whether you could perhaps temporarily...\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery kindly...\u201d puts in Suze.</p><p>\u201cVery kindly... perhaps extend my overdraft a little further, on a... a short-term...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodwill...\u201d interjects Suze.</p><p>\u201cGoodwill... temporary... short-term basis. Obviously to be paid back as soon as is feasibly and humanly possible.\u201d I stop, and draw breath.</p><p>\u201cHave you finished?\u201d says John Gavin, folding his arms.</p><p>\u201cErm... yes.\u201d I look to Suze for confirmation. \u201cYes, we have.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s silence while John Gavin drums his Biro on the table. Then he looks up and says, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d I look at him puzzledly. \u201cIs that just... no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust no.\u201d He pushes back his chair. \u201cSo if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, no?\u201d says Suze. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say no! You have to weigh up the pros and cons!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have weighed up the pros and the cons,\u201d says John Gavin. \u201cThere are no pros.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this is one of your most valued customers!\u201d Suze\u2019s voice rises in dismay. \u201cThis is Becky Bloomwood of TV fame, who has a huge, glittering career in front of her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Becky Bloomwood who has had her overdraft limit extended six times in the last year,\u201d says John Gavin in a rather nasty voice. \u201cAnd who each time has failed to keep within those limits. This is Becky Bloomwood who has consistently lied, who has consistently avoided meetings, who has treated bank staff with little or no respect, and who seems to think we\u2019re all here solely to fund her appetite for shoes. I\u2019ve looked at your file, Miss Bloomwood. I know the picture.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a subdued little silence. I can feel my cheeks getting hotter and hotter and I\u2019ve got a horrible feeling I might cry.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you should be so mean!\u201d says Suze in a burst. \u201cBecky\u2019s just had a really awful time! Would you like to be in the tabloids? Would you like to have someone stalking you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see!\u201d His voice glints with sarcasm. \u201cYou expect me to feel sorry for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say. \u201cNo. Not exactly. But I think you should give me a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I should give you another chance. And what have you done to merit another chance?\u201d He shakes his head, and there\u2019s silence.</p><p>\u201cI just... I thought if I explained it all to you...\u201d I tail off feebly and shoot Suze a hopeless look to say, \u201cLet\u2019s just forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, is it hot in here?\u201d says Suze in a sudden husky voice. She takes off her jacket, shakes back her hair, and runs one hand down her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m feeling really... hot. Are you feeling hot, John?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>John Gavin shoots her an irritated look.</p><p>\u201cWhat precisely did you want to explain to me, Miss Bloomwood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Just that I really want to sort things out,\u201d I say, my voice trembling. \u201cYou know, I really want to turn things around. I want to stand on my own two feet, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStand on your own two feet?\u201d interrupts John Gavin scathingly. \u201cYou call taking handouts from a bank \u2018standing on your own two feet\u2019? If you were really standing on your own two feet, you\u2019d have no overdraft. You\u2019d have a few assets by now! You, of all people, shouldn\u2019t need telling that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI... I know,\u201d I say, my voice barely above a whisper. \u201cBut the fact is, I have got an overdraft. And I just thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought what? That you\u2019re special? That you\u2019re an exception because you\u2019re on the television? That the normal rules don\u2019t apply to you? That this bank owes you money?\u201d</p><p>His voice is like a drill in my head and suddenly I feel myself snap.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I cry. \u201cI don\u2019t think that. I don\u2019t think any of that. I know I\u2019ve been stupid, and I know I\u2019ve done wrong. But I think that everyone does wrong occasionally.\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cYou know, if you look at your files, you\u2019ll see I did pay off my overdraft. And I did pay off my store cards. And OK, I\u2019m in debt again. But I\u2019m trying to sort it out \u2014 and all you can do is... is sneer. Well, fine. I\u2019ll sort myself out without your help. Come on, Suze.\u201d</p><p>Shaking slightly, I get to my feet. My eyes are hot, but I\u2019m not going to cry in front of him. There\u2019s a shaft of determination inside me, which strengthens as I turn to face him.</p> <p>\u201cEndwich \u2014 because we care,\u201d I say.</p><p>There\u2019s a long, tense silence. Then, without saying anything else, I open the door and walk out.</p><p>As we walk home, I feel almost high with determination. I\u2019ll show him. I\u2019ll show that John Gavin. And all of them. The whole world.</p><p>I\u2019m going to pay off my debts. I don\u2019t know how \u2014 but I\u2019m going to do it. I\u2019ll take an extra job waitressing, maybe. Or I\u2019ll get down to it, and finish my self-help book. I\u2019ll just make as much money as I can, as quickly as I can. And then I\u2019ll go into that bank with a huge check, and plonk it down in front of him, and in a dignified but pointed voice, I\u2019ll say\u2014</p><p>\u201cBex?\u201d Suze grabs my arm \u2014 and I realize I\u2019m walking straight past our house.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d says Suze as she lets us in. \u201cHonestly, what a bastard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say, lifting my chin. \u201cI\u2019m going to show him. I\u2019m going to pay off my overdraft. Just wait. I\u2019m going to show them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent!\u201d says Suze. She bends down and picks up a letter from the doormat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for you,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom Morning Coffee!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right!\u201d As I\u2019m opening the envelope, I feel a huge leap of hope. Maybe they\u2019re offering me a new job! Something with a huge salary, enough to pay off my debts straight away. Maybe they\u2019ve sacked Emma and I\u2019m going to take her place as the main presenter! Or maybe...</p><p>Oh my God.

Jungle Survival by Brig. Roger Flintwood (deceased)</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS, I don\u2019t leave the house. I don\u2019t answer the phone and I don\u2019t talk to anyone. I feel physically raw, as though people\u2019s gazes, or their questions, or even the sunlight, might hurt me. I need to be in a dark place, on my own. Suze has gone to Milton Keynes for a big sales and marketing conference with Hadleys, so I\u2019m all alone in the flat. I order takeout, drink two bottles of white wine, and don\u2019t once get out of my pajamas.</p> <p>When Suze returns, I\u2019m sitting on the floor in the sitting room where she left me, staring blankly at the television, stuffing KitKats into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she says, dropping her bag on the floor. \u201cBex, are you OK? I shouldn\u2019t have left you on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d I say, looking up and forcing my stiff face to twist into a smile. \u201cHow was the sales conference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... it was really good, actually,\u201d says Suze, looking abashed. \u201cPeople kept congratulating me on the way my frames have been selling. They\u2019d all heard of me! And they did a presentation of my new designs, and everybody loved them...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really great, Suze,\u201d I say, and reach up to squeeze her hand. \u201cYou deserve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. You know.\u201d She bites her lip \u2014 then picks up an empty wine bottle from the floor and puts it on the table.</p> <p>\u201cSo, did... Luke call?\u201d she says hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, after a long silence. \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t.\u201d I look at Suze, then look away again.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you watching?\u201d she says, as an ad for Diet Coke comes on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m watching Morning Coffee,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s the financial advice slot coming up next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Suze\u2019s face creases in dismay. \u201cBex, let\u2019s switch channels.\u201d She reaches for the remote control, but I grab it.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say, staring rigidly at the screen. \u201cI want to see it.\u201d</p><p>The familiar Morning Coffee music blasts out of the screen as the signature graphic of a cup of coffee appears and then melts away to a studio shot.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d says Emma cheerily to camera. \u201cWelcome back. And it\u2019s time for us to introduce our new money expert, Clare Edwards!\u201d</p> <p>I stare at Clare\u2019s familiar face, feeling a fresh humiliation seep over me. When they promoted her appearance earlier on I was so shocked I spilled my coffee on my hand. It still hurts.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Clare Edwards?\u201d says Suze, staring at the screen in distaste.</p><p>\u201cI used to work with her on Successful Saving,\u201d I say without moving my head. \u201cShe used to sit next to me.\u201d</p><p>The camera pans away to show Clare sitting on the sofa opposite Emma, staring grimly back.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t look like much fun,\u201d says Suze.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Clare,\u201d says Emma brightly. \u201cWhat\u2019s your basic philosophy of money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a catchphrase?\u201d interjects Rory cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in catchphrases,\u201d says Clare, giving Rory a disapproving look. \u201cPersonal finance isn\u2019t a trivial matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d says Rory. \u201cOf course not. Erm... so \u2014 do you have any top tips for savers, Clare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in futile and misleading generalizations,\u201d says Clare. \u201cAll savers should choose a spread of investments suitable to their individual requirements and tax status.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d says Emma after a pause. \u201cRight. Well \u2014 let\u2019s go to the phones, shall we? And it\u2019s Mandy from Norwich.\u201d</p><p>As the first caller is put through, the phone in our sitting room rings.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d says Suze, picking it up and zapping the sound on the television, \u201cOoh, hello, Mrs. Bloomwood. Do you want to speak to Becky?\u201d</p><p>She raises her eyebrows at me and I wince back. I\u2019ve only spoken to Mum and Dad briefly since my return. They know I\u2019m not going to move to New York \u2014 but that\u2019s all I\u2019ve said them so far. I just can\u2019t face telling them how badly everything else has turned out too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecky, love, I was just watching Morning Coffee!\u201d exclaims Mum. \u201cWhat\u2019s that girl doing, giving out financial advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... it\u2019s OK, Mum, don\u2019t worry!\u201d I say, feeling my nails dig into my palm. \u201cThey just... they got her to cover while I was away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. They could have chosen someone better! She\u2019s got a miserable face on her, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d Her voice goes muffled. \u201cWhat\u2019s that, Graham?

But surely, now that you\u2019re back, they can let her go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cContracts and... things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, when will you be back on? Because I know Janice will be asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Mum,\u201d I say desperately. \u201cListen, I\u2019ve got to go, OK? There\u2019s someone at the door. But I\u2019ll talk to you soon!\u201d</p><p>I put down the phone and bury my head in my hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d I say hopelessly. \u201cWhat am I going to do, Suze? I can\u2019t tell them I\u2019ve been fired. I just can\u2019t.\u201d To my dismay, tears squeeze out of the sides of my eyes. \u201cThey\u2019re so proud of me. And I just keep letting them down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t let them down!\u201d retorts Suze hotly. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault that stupid Morning Coffee completely overreacted. And I bet they\u2019re regretting it now. I mean, look at her!\u201d</p> <p>She turns up the sound, and Clare\u2019s voice drones sternly through the room. \u201cThose who fail to provide for their own retirement are the equivalent of leeches on the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say,\u201d says Rory. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a bit harsh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, listen to her!\u201d says Suze. \u201cShe\u2019s awful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she is,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cBut even if they get rid of her too they\u2019ll never ask me back. It would be like saying they made a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have made a mistake!\u201d</p><p>The phone rings again and she looks at me. \u201cAre you in or out?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOut. And you don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK...\u201d She picks up the phone. \u201cHello? Sorry, Becky\u2019s out at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWendy, you\u2019ve made every mistake possible,\u201d Clare Edwards is saying on the screen. \u201cHave you never heard of a deposit account? And as for remortgaging your house to buy a boat...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know when she\u2019ll be back,\u201d says Suze. \u201cWould you like me to take a message?\u201d She picks up a pen and starts writing. \u201cOK... fine... yes. Yes, I\u2019ll tell her. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I say as she puts the phone down. \u201cWho was that?\u201d</p><p>And I know it\u2019s stupid \u2014 but as I look up at her, I can\u2019t help feeling a hot flicker of hope. Maybe it was a producer from another show. Maybe it was someone wanting to offer me my own column. Maybe it was John Gavin, ringing to apologize and offer me free, unlimited overdraft facilities. Maybe it was the one phone call that will make everything all right.</p><p>\u201cIt was Mel. Luke\u2019s assistant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I stare at her in apprehension. \u201cWhat did she want?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cApparently some parcel has arrived at the office, addressed to you. From the States. From Barnes &amp; Noble.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her blankly \u2014 then, with a pang, suddenly remember that trip to Barnes &amp; Noble I made with Luke. I bought a whole pile of coffee-table books, and Luke suggested I send them back on the company courier bill instead of lugging them around. It seems like a million years ago now.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, I know what that is.\u201d I hesitate. \u201cDid she... mention Luke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Suze apologetically. \u201cShe just said pop in anytime you want. And she said she was really sorry about what happened... and if you ever want a chat, just call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I hunch my shoulders up, hug my knees, and turn up the television volume.</p><p>For the next few days, I tell myself I won\u2019t bother going. I don\u2019t really want those books anymore. And I can\u2019t quite cope with the thought of having to go in there \u2014 having to face all the curious looks from Luke\u2019s staff, and hold my head up and pretend to be OK.</p><p>But then, gradually, I start to think I\u2019d like to see Mel. She\u2019s the only one I can talk to who really knows Luke, and it would be nice to have a heart-to-heart with her. Plus, she might have heard something of what\u2019s going on in the States. I know Luke and I are effectively over, I know it\u2019s really nothing to do with me anymore. But I still can\u2019t help caring about whether he\u2019s got his deal or not. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So four days later, at about six o\u2019clock in the evening, I walk slowly toward the doors of Brandon Communications, my heart thumping. Luckily it\u2019s the friendly doorman on duty. He\u2019s seen me visit enough times to just wave me in, so I don\u2019t have to have any big announcements of my arrival.</p><p>I walk out of the lift at the fifth floor, and to my surprise, there\u2019s no one on reception. How weird. I wait for a few seconds \u2014 then wander past the desk and down the main corridor. Gradually my steps slow down \u2014 and a puzzled frown comes to my face. There\u2019s something wrong here. Something different.</p><p>It\u2019s too quiet. The whole place is practically dead. When I look across the open-plan space, most of the chairs are empty. There aren\u2019t any phones ringing; there aren\u2019t any people striding about; there aren\u2019t brainstorming sessions going on.</p><p>What\u2019s going on? What\u2019s happened to the buzzy Brandon C atmosphere? What\u2019s happened to Luke\u2019s company?</p> <p>As I pass the coffee machine, two guys I half-recognize are standing, talking by it. One\u2019s got a disgruntled expression and the other is agreeing \u2014 but I can\u2019t quite hear what they\u2019re talking about. As I come near, they stop abruptly. They shoot me curious looks, then glance at each other and walk off, before starting to talk again, but in lowered voices.</p><p>I can\u2019t quite believe this is Brandon Communications. There\u2019s a completely different feel about the place. This is like some deadbeat company where no one cares about what they\u2019re doing. I walk to Mel\u2019s desk \u2014 and, along with everyone else, she\u2019s already left for the night. Mel, who normally stays till at least seven, then takes a glass of wine and gets changed in the loos for whatever great night out she\u2019s got planned.</p><p>I root around behind her chair until I find the parcel addressed to me, and scribble a note to her on a Post-it. Then I stand up, hugging the heavy package to me, and tell myself that I\u2019ve got what I came for. Now I should leave. There\u2019s nothing to keep me.</p><p>But instead of walking away, I stand motionless. Staring at Luke\u2019s closed office door.</p><p>Luke\u2019s office. There are probably faxes from him in there. Messages about how things are going in New York. Maybe even messages about me. As I gaze at the smooth blank wood, I feel almost overwhelmed by an urge to go in and find out what I can.</p> <p>But then \u2014 what exactly would I do? Look through his files? Listen to his voice mail? I mean, what if someone caught me?</p><p>I\u2019m standing there, torn \u2014 knowing I\u2019m not really going to go and rifle through his stuff, yet unable just to walk away \u2014 when suddenly I stiffen in shock. The handle of his office door is starting to move.</p><p>Oh shit. Shit. There\u2019s someone in there! They\u2019re coming out!</p><p>In a moment of pure panic, I find myself ducking down out of sight, behind Mel\u2019s chair. As I curl up into a tiny ball I feel a thrill of terror, like a child playing hide-and-seek. I hear some voices murmuring \u2014 and then the door swings open and someone comes out. From my vantage point, all I can see is that it\u2019s a female, and she\u2019s wearing those new Chanel shoes which cost an absolute bomb. She\u2019s followed by two pairs of male legs, and the three begin to walk down the corridor. I can\u2019t resist peeping out from behind the chair \u2014 and of course. It\u2019s Alicia Bitch Longlegs, with Ben Bridges and a man who looks familiar but whom I can\u2019t quite place.</p><p>Well, I suppose that\u2019s fair enough. She\u2019s in charge while Luke is away. But does she have to take over Luke\u2019s office? I mean, why can\u2019t she just use a meeting room?</p><p>\u201cSorry we had to meet here,\u201d I can just hear her saying. \u201cObviously, next time, it\u2019ll be at 17 King Street.\u201d</p> <p>They continue talking until they reach the lifts, and I pray desperately that they\u2019ll all get inside one and disappear. But as the lift doors ping open, only the familiar-looking man gets in \u2014 and a moment later, Alicia and Ben are heading back toward Luke\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just get those files,\u201d says Alicia, and goes back into Luke\u2019s office, leaving the door open. Meanwhile, Ben is lolling against the water dispenser, pressing the buttons on his watch and staring intently at the tiny screen.</p><p>This is horrendous! I\u2019m trapped until they leave. My knees are starting to hurt and I\u2019ve got an awful feeling that if I move an inch, one of them will crack. What if Ben and Alicia stay here all night? What if they come over to Mel\u2019s desk? What if they decide to make love on Mel\u2019s desk?</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Alicia, suddenly appearing at the door. \u201cI think that\u2019s it. Good meeting, I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d Ben looks up from his watch. \u201cDo you think Frank\u2019s right? Do you think he might sue?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Frank! Of course. That other man was Frank Harper. The publicity guy from Bank of London. I used to see him at press conferences.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t sue,\u201d says Alicia calmly. \u201cHe\u2019s got too much face to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lost a fair amount already,\u201d says Ben, raising his eyebrows. \u201cHe\u2019ll be the invisible man before too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d says Alicia, and smirks back at him. She looks at the pile of folders in her arms. \u201cHave I got everything? I think so. Right, I\u2019m off. Ed will be waiting for me. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>They both disappear down the corridor and this time, thank God, they get into a lift. When I\u2019m quite sure they\u2019ve gone, I sit back on my heels with a puzzled frown. What\u2019s going on? Why were they talking about suing? Suing who? And how come Bank of London was here?</p><p>Is Bank of London going to sue Luke? It sounds like everything\u2019s a complete mess! I thought Alicia was supposed to have everything under control.</p><p>For a while I just sit still, trying to work it all out. But I\u2019m not really getting anywhere \u2014 and suddenly it occurs to me that I ought to get out while the going\u2019s good. I get up, wincing at the cramp in my foot, and shake out my legs as the circulation returns to them. Then I pick up my parcel, shake back my head, and as nonchalantly as possible, walk down the corridor toward the lifts. Just as I\u2019m pressing the \u201cSummon\u201d button, my mobile phone rings inside my bag, and I give a startled jump. Shit, my phone! Thank God that didn\u2019t happen while I was hiding behind Mel\u2019s desk!</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I say, as I get into the lift.</p><p>\u201cBex! It\u2019s Suze.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSuze!\u201d I say, and give a shaky giggle. \u201cYou have no idea how you nearly just got me in trouble! If you\u2019d rung like, five minutes ago, you would have completely...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex, listen,\u201d says Suze urgently. \u201cYou\u2019ve just had a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right?\u201d I press the ground-floor button. \u201cFrom who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Zelda at Morning Coffee! She wants to talk to you! She said, do you want to meet for a quick lunch tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>That night, I barely get an hour\u2019s sleep. Suze and I stay up till late, deciding on what I should wear \u2014 and when I\u2019ve gone to bed, I lie awake, staring at the ceiling, feeling my mind flip around like a fish. Will they offer my old job back after all? Will they offer me a different job? Maybe they\u2019ll upgrade me! Maybe they\u2019ll give me my own show!</p><p>But by the early hours of the morning, all my wild fantasies have faded away, leaving the simple truth. The truth is, all I really want is my old job back. I want to be able to tell Mum to start watching again, and to start paying off my overdraft... and to start my life all over again. Another chance. That\u2019s all I want.</p> <p>\u201cYou see?\u201d says Suze the next morning as I\u2019m getting ready. \u201cYou see? I knew they\u2019d want you back. That Clare Edwards is crap! Completely and utterly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuze,\u201d I interrupt. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d says Suze, looking me up and down approvingly. I\u2019m wearing my black Banana Republic trousers and a pale fitted jacket over a white shirt, and a dark green scarf round my neck.</p><p>I would have worn my Denny and George scarf \u2014 in fact, I even picked it up from the dressing table. But then, almost immediately, I put it down again. I don\u2019t quite know why.</p><p>\u201cVery kick-ass,\u201d adds Suze. \u201cWhere are you having lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLorenzo\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSan Lorenzo?\u201d Her eyes widen impressively.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. Just... Lorenzo\u2019s. I\u2019ve never been there before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, you make sure you order champagne,\u201d says Suze. \u201cAnd tell them you\u2019re fighting off loads of other offers, so if they want you to come back, they\u2019re going to have to pay big bucks. That\u2019s the deal, take it or leave it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, unscrewing my mascara.</p><p>\u201cIf their margins suffer, then so be it,\u201d says Suze emphatically. \u201cFor a quality product you have to pay quality prices. You want to close the deal at your price, on your terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuze...\u201d I stop, mascara wand on my lashes. \u201cWhere are you getting all this stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll this... margins and close the deal stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that! From the Hadleys conference. We had a seminar from one of the top salespeople in the U.S.! It was great! You know, a product is only as good as the person selling it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d I pick up my bag and check that I\u2019ve got everything \u2014 then look up and take a deep breath. \u201cRight, I\u2019m going.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood luck!\u201d says Suze. \u201cExcept you know, there is no luck in business.

It\u2019s mostly just office blocks, with a few little newsagenty-type shops, and a coffee shop, and a...</p><p>Hang on. I stop still and stare at the sign above the coffee shop. \u201cLorenzo\u2019s coffee shop and sandwich bar.\u201d</p> <p>But surely... this can\u2019t be where we\u2019re meeting?</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d My head jerks up, and I see Zelda walking along the street toward me, in jeans and a Puffa. \u201cYou found it all right!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, trying not to look discomfited. \u201cYes, I found it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind just a quick sandwich, do you?\u201d she says, sweeping me inside. \u201cIt\u2019s just that this place is quite convenient for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean... a sandwich would be great!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood! I recommend the Italian chicken!\u201d She eyes me up and down. \u201cYou look very smart. Off somewhere nice?\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, feeling a pang of mortification. I can\u2019t admit I dressed up specially to see her.</p><p>\u201cErm... yes.\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cA... a meeting I\u2019ve got later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh well, I won\u2019t keep you long. Just a little proposition we wanted to put to you.\u201d She shoots me a quick smile. \u201cWe thought it would be nicer to do it face to face.\u201d</p><p>This isn\u2019t exactly what I imagined for our power lunch. But as I watch the sandwich guy smoothing Italian chicken onto our bread, adding salad, and slicing each sandwich into four quarters, I start to feel more positive. OK, maybe this isn\u2019t a grand place with tablecloths and champagne. Maybe they aren\u2019t pushing the boat out. But then, that\u2019s probably good! It shows they still think of me as part of the team, doesn\u2019t it? Someone to have a relaxed sandwich with, and thrash out ideas for the forthcoming season.</p><p>Maybe they want to take me on board as a features consultant. Or train me to become a producer!</p> <p>\u201cWe all felt for you dreadfully, Becky,\u201d says Zelda as we make our way to a tiny wooden table, balancing our trays of sandwiches and drinks. \u201cHow are things going? Have you got a job lined up in New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm... not exactly,\u201d I say, and take a sip of my mineral water. \u201cThat\u2019s all kind of... on hold.\u201d I see her eyes watching me appraisingly, and quickly add, \u201cBut I\u2019ve been considering lots of offers. You know \u2014 various projects, and... and ideas in development...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh good! I\u2019m so glad. We all felt very bad that you had to go. And I want you to know, it wasn\u2019t my decision.\u201d She puts her hand on mine briefly, then removes it to take a bite of her sandwich. \u201cSo now \u2014 to business.\u201d She takes a sip of tea, and I feel my stomach flutter with nerves. \u201cYou remember our producer, Barry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do!\u201d I say, slightly taken aback. Are they expecting me to have forgotten the name of the producer already?</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s come up with quite an interesting idea.\u201d Zelda beams at me, and I beam back. \u201cHe thinks the Morning Coffee viewers would be really interested to hear about your... little problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, feeling my smile freeze on my face. \u201cWell, it\u2019s... it\u2019s not really a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he thought perhaps you would be ideal to take part in a discussion and/or phone-in on the subject.\u201d She takes a sip of tea. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>I stare at her in confusion.</p> <p>\u201cAre you talking about going back to my regular slot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no! I mean, we could hardly have you giving financial advice, could we?\u201d She gives a little laugh. \u201cNo, this would be more of a one-off, topical piece. \u2018How shopping wrecked my life.\u2019 That kind of thing.\u201d She takes a bite of sandwich. \u201cAnd ideally, it would be quite a... how can I put this? An emotional piece. Maybe you could bare your soul a little. Talk about your parents, how this has ruined their lives too... problems in your childhood... relationship trouble... these are just ideas, obviously!\u201d She looks up. \u201cAnd you know, if you were able to cry...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo... to cry?\u201d I echo disbelievingly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not compulsory. By any means.\u201d Zelda leans earnestly forward. \u201cWe want this to be a good experience for you too, Becky. We want to help. So we\u2019d have Clare Edwards in the studio too, to offer you advice...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cClare Edwards!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!

There\u2019d be a fee, of course!\u201d she says. \u201cI should have mentioned that at the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so. I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t answer yet. Think about it!\u201d Zelda flashes me a cheery smile, then glances at her watch. \u201cI must dash, I\u2019m afraid. But it\u2019s lovely to see you, Becky.

I\u2019m outwardly calm \u2014 but inside I\u2019m burning with mortified rage. They want me to go on and cry. That\u2019s all they want. One article in one crappy tabloid \u2014 and suddenly I\u2019m not Becky Bloomwood, financial expert. I\u2019m Becky Bloomwood, failure and flake. I\u2019m Becky Bloomwood, watch her cry and pass the hankies.</p><p>Well, they can just bloody well stuff their bloody hankies. They can just take their stupid, bloody... stupid... stupid... bloody...</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d says the man at the next table \u2014 and to my horror I realize I\u2019m muttering aloud.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say. \u201cThanks.\u201d I put down my glass and walk out of Lorenzo\u2019s, my head high and my chin stiff.</p><p>I walk down the road and turn a corner without even noticing where I\u2019m going. I don\u2019t know the area and I don\u2019t have anyplace I need to get to \u2014 so I just walk, almost hypnotizing myself with the rhythm of my steps, thinking eventually I\u2019ll hit a tube station.</p><p>As I walk, my eyes start to smart and I tell myself it\u2019s the cold air. It\u2019s the wind. I shove my hands in my pockets and tighten my chin and start to walk faster, trying to keep my mind empty. But there\u2019s a blank dread inside me; a hollow panic that is getting worse and worse. I haven\u2019t got my job back. I haven\u2019t even got the prospect of a job. What am I going to say to Suze? What am I going to say to Mum?</p> <p>What am I going to do with my life?</p><p>\u201cOy! Watch out!\u201d yells someone behind me \u2014 and to my horror I realize I\u2019ve stepped off the pavement in front of a cyclist.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say in a husky voice as the cyclist swerves off, shooting me the finger. This is ridiculous. I\u2019ve got to pull myself together. I mean, where am I, for a start? I start to walk more slowly along the pavement, peering up at the glass doors of offices, looking for the name of the road I\u2019m on. And I\u2019m just about to ask a traffic warden \u2014 when suddenly I see a sign. King Street.</p><p>For a moment I stare at it blankly, wondering why it\u2019s chiming a bell inside my head. Then, with a jolt, I remember: 17 King Street. Alicia.</p><p>I peer at the number embossed on the glass doors nearest me \u2014 and it\u2019s 23. Which means... I must have just walked past number 17.</p><p>Now I\u2019m completely consumed by curiosity. What on earth goes on at 17 King Street? Is it some secret cult, or something? God, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if she was a witch in her spare time.</p><p>My whole body is prickling with intrigue as I retrace my steps until I\u2019m standing outside a modest set of double doors marked 17. It\u2019s obviously a building with lots of different little companies inside, but as I run my eye down the list, none sounds familiar.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d says a bloke in a denim jacket, holding a cup of coffee. He comes up to the doors, presses a code into the keypad, and pushes the door open. \u201cYou look lost. Who are you after?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cErm... I\u2019m not sure actually,\u201d I say hesitantly. \u201cI thought I knew somebody who worked here, but I can\u2019t remember the name of the company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... it\u2019s Alicia,\u201d I say \u2014 then immediately wish I hadn\u2019t. What if this guy knows Alicia? What if she\u2019s in there somewhere and he goes and fetches her?</p><p>But he\u2019s frowning puzzledly. \u201cI don\u2019t know an Alicia... Mind you, there\u2019s a few new faces around at the moment... What sort of business is she in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPR,\u201d I say after a pause.</p><p>\u201cPR? We\u2019re mostly graphic design, here...\u201d Suddenly his face clears. \u201cHey, but maybe she\u2019s with the new company. B and B? BBB? Something like that. They haven\u2019t started trading yet, so we haven\u2019t met them.\u201d He takes a sip of cappuccino and I stare at him. My mind is starting to twitch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA new PR company?

You know, there\u2019s a clause in their contracts forbidding employees to do this? If they poach a client, Luke could sue them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey talked about that. They seem to think he won\u2019t sue because he\u2019d lose too much face.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence \u2014 and I can almost hear Michael thinking down the line.</p><p>\u201cThey have a point,\u201d he says at last. \u201cBecky, I have to talk to Luke. You did a great job finding out what you did...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the only thing.\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cMichael, someone\u2019s got to talk to Luke. I went into the Brandon Communications office, and it was completely dead. No one\u2019s making any effort, everyone\u2019s going home early... it\u2019s a whole different atmosphere. It\u2019s not good.\u201d I bite my lip. \u201cHe needs to come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell him this yourself?\u201d says Michael gently. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019d like to hear from you.\u201d</p><p>He sounds so kind and concerned, I feel a sudden prickle in my nose.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.

It was a great pleasure to meet such a cultured and well-connected young lady as yourself.</p><p>I write because I am coming to England in two weeks\u2019 time and I was very much hoping that you might be able to introduce me to Prince William and, if possible, the queen? I would be honored to take the three of you to dinner, whenever is convenient.</p><p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p><p>With kind regards,</p><p>Marion Jefferson (Mrs.)</p><p>P.S. If not the queen, then maybe Prince Philip?</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>AFTER A WEEK, I give up on hearing anything from Michael. Whatever he\u2019s said to Luke, I\u2019m never going to hear about it. I feel as though that whole part of my life is over. Luke, America, television, everything. Time to start again.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to keep positive, and tell myself I\u2019ve lots of avenues open to me. But what is the next career move for an ex\u2014 television financial expert? I rang up a television agent, and to my dismay, she sounded exactly like all those TV people in America. She said she was thrilled to hear from me, she\u2019d have absolutely no problem finding me work \u2014 if not my own series \u2014 and that she\u2019d ring back that day with lots of exciting news. I haven\u2019t heard from her since. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So now I\u2019m reduced to looking through the Media Guardian, looking for jobs I might just have half a chance of getting. So far, I\u2019ve ringed a staff writer job on Investor\u2019s Chronicle, an assistant editorship of Personal Investment Periodical, and editor of Annuities Today. I don\u2019t know much about annuities, but I can always quickly read a book about it.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d says Suze, coming into the room with a bowl of crunchy nut cornflakes.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say, trying to raise a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll get there.\u201d Suze takes a mouthful of cereal and eyes me thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you got planned for today?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing much,\u201d I say morosely. \u201cYou know \u2014 just trying to get a job. Sort out my mess of a life. That kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right.\u201d Suze pulls a sympathetic face. \u201cHave you found anything interesting yet?\u201d</p><p>I flick my fingers toward a ringed advertisement.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d go for editor of Annuities Today. The right candidate may also be considered for editorship of the annual Tax Rebate supplement!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She involuntarily pulls a face \u2014 then hastily adds, \u201cI mean... that sounds good! Really interesting!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTax rebates? Suze, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell \u2014 you know. Relatively speaking.\u201d</p><p>I rest my head on my knees and stare at the sitting-room carpet. The sound on the television has been turned down, and there\u2019s silence in the room apart from Suze munching. I close my eyes and slump down farther on the floor, until my head\u2019s resting on the sofa seat. I feel as though I could stay here for the rest of my life.</p><p>\u201cBex, I\u2019m worried about you,\u201d says Suze. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been out for days. What else are you planning to do today?\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes briefly and see her peering anxiously down at me.</p><p>\u201cDunno. Watch Morning Coffee.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are not watching Morning Coffee!\u201d says Suze firmly. \u201cCome on.\u201d She closes the Media Guardian. \u201cI\u2019ve had a really good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say suspiciously as she drags me to my room. She swings open the door, leads me inside, and spreads her arms around, gesturing to the mess everywhere.</p><p>\u201cI think you should spend the morning decluttering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at her in horror. \u201cI don\u2019t want to declutter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do! Honestly, you\u2019ll feel so great, like I did. It was brilliant! I felt so good afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and you had no clothes! You had to borrow knickers from me for three weeks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, OK,\u201d she concedes. \u201cMaybe I went a bit too far. But the point is, it completely transforms your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt does! It\u2019s feng shui! You have to let things out of your life to allow the new good things in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true! The moment I decluttered, I got Hadleys phoning me up with an offer. Come on, Bex... Just a little bit of decluttering would do you a world of good.\u201d</p><p>She throws open my wardrobe and begins to leaf through my clothes.</p><p>\u201cI mean, look at this,\u201d she says, pulling out a blue fringed suede skirt. \u201cWhen did you last wear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm... quite recently,\u201d I say, crossing my fingers behind my back. I bought that skirt off a stall in the Portobello Road without trying it on \u2014 and when I got it home it was too small. But you never know, I might lose loads of weight one day.</p><p>\u201cAnd these... and these...\u201d She gives an incredulous frown. \u201cBlimey, Bex, how many pairs of black trousers have you got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one! Two, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour... five... six...\u201d She\u2019s leafing through the hangers, sternly plucking out pairs of trousers.</p><p>\u201cThose ones are just for when I feel fat,\u201d I say defensively as she pulls out my comfy old Benetton boot-cuts. \u201cAnd those are jeans!\u201d I exclaim as she starts rooting around at the bottom. \u201cJeans don\u2019t count as trousers!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays everybody! It\u2019s common knowledge!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen... eleven...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah... and those are for skiing! They\u2019re a completely different thing! They\u2019re sportswear.\u201d Suze turns to look at me.</p><p>\u201cBex, you\u2019ve never been skiing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say after a short silence. \u201cBut... you know. Just in case I ever get asked. And they were on sale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s this?\u201d She picks up my fencing mask gingerly. \u201cThis could go straight in the bin.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m taking up fencing!\u201d I say indignantly. \u201cI\u2019m going to be Catherine Zeta-Jones\u2019s stunt double!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even understand how you can fit all this stuff in here. Don\u2019t you ever chuck things out?\u201d She picks up a pair of shoes decorated with shells. \u201cI mean, these. Do you ever wear these anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... no.\u201d I see her expression. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the point. If I did chuck them out, then shells would come back in the next day \u2014 and I\u2019d have to buy a new pair. So this is like... insurance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShells are never going to come back in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey might! It\u2019s like the weather. You just can\u2019t tell.\u201d</p><p>Suze shakes her head, and picks her way over the piles of stuff on the floor toward the door. \u201cI\u2019m giving you two hours and when I come back I want to see a transformed room. Transformed room \u2014 transformed life. Now start!\u201d</p><p>She disappears out of the room and I sit on my bed, staring disconsolately around at my room.</p><p>Well, OK, maybe she does have a point. Maybe I should have a little tidy-up. But I don\u2019t even know where to start. I mean, if I start throwing things out just because I never wear them \u2014 where will I stop? I\u2019ll end up with nothing.</p><p>And it\u2019s all so hard. It\u2019s all so much effort.</p> <p>I pick up a jumper, look at it for a few seconds, then put it down again. Just the thought of trying to decide whether to keep it or not exhausts me.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d comes Suze\u2019s voice from outside the door.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d I call back brightly. \u201cReally good!\u201d</p><p>Come on, I\u2019ve got to do something. OK, maybe I should start in one corner, and work my way round. I pick my way to the corner of my room, where a heap of stuff is teetering on my dressing table, and try to work out what everything is. There\u2019s all that office equipment I ordered off the Internet... There\u2019s that wooden bowl I bought ages ago because it was in Elle Decoration (and then saw exactly the same one in Woolworth\u2019s)... a tie-dye kit... some sea salt for doing body rubs... What is all this stuff, anyway? What\u2019s this box which I haven\u2019t even opened?</p><p>I open up the package and stare at a fifty-meter roll of turkey foil. Turkey foil? Why would I buy that? Was I once planning to cook a turkey? Puzzledly I reach for the letter on top, and see the words, \u201cWelcome to the world of Country Ways. We\u2019re so pleased your good friend, Mrs. Jane Bloomwood, recommended our catalogue to you...\u201d</p><p>Oh God, of course. It\u2019s just that stuff Mum ordered to get her free gift. A casserole dish, some turkey foil... some of those plastic bags she was stuffing patio cushions into... some weird gadget for putting in the...</p> <p>Hang on.</p><p>Just hang on a minute. I drop the gadget and slowly reach for the plastic bags again. A woman with a dodgy blond haircut is staring proudly at me over a shrink-wrapped duvet, and a bubble from her mouth reads, \u201cWith up to 75 percent reduction, I have so much more room in my closet now!\u201d</p><p>Cautiously I open my door, and tiptoe along to the broom cupboard. As I pass the sitting room I look in \u2014 and to my astonishment Suze is sitting on the sofa with Tarquin, talking earnestly.</p><p>\u201cTarquin!\u201d I say, and both their heads jerk up guiltily. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear you arrive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Becky,\u201d he says, not meeting my eye.</p><p>\u201cWe just had to... talk about something,\u201d says Suze, giving me an embarrassed look. \u201cHave you finished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm... nearly,\u201d I say. \u201cI just thought I\u2019d hoover my room. To make it look really good!\u201d</p><p>I shut my door behind me, and pull the bags out of their packaging. Right. This should be nice and easy. Just stuff them full, and suck out the air. Ten sweaters per bag, it says \u2014 but frankly, who\u2019s going to count?</p> <p>I start to stuff clothes into the first bag, until it\u2019s as tightly packed as I can get it. Panting with effort, I close the plastic zip \u2014 then attach the hoover nozzle to the hole. And I don\u2019t believe this. It works. It works! Before my eyes, my clothes are shrinking away into nothing!</p><p>Oh, this is fantastic. This is going to revolutionize my life! Why on earth declutter when you can just shrink-wrap?</p><p>There are eight bags in all \u2014 and when they\u2019re all full, I cram them all into my wardrobe and close the door. It\u2019s a bit of a tight squash \u2014 and I can hear a bit of a hissing sound as I force the door shut \u2014 but the point is, they\u2019re in. They\u2019re contained.</p><p>And just look at my room now! It\u2019s incredible! OK, it\u2019s not exactly immaculate \u2014 but it\u2019s so much better than it was before. I quickly shove a few stray items under my duvet, arrange some cushions on top, and stand back. As I look around, I feel all warm and proud of myself. I\u2019ve never seen my room look so good before. And Suze is right \u2014 I do feel different, somehow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>You know, maybe feng shui\u2019s got something to it after all.

It took me ages to sort all my stuff out!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, you know.\u201d I shrug nonchalantly. \u201cOnce I decide to do something, I do it.\u201d</p><p>She takes a few steps in, and looks in astonishment at my dressing table.</p><p>\u201cI never knew that dressing table had a marble top!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d I say proudly. \u201cIt\u2019s quite nice, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut where\u2019s all the rubbish? Where are the bin bags?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re... I\u2019ve already got rid of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did you chuck loads out?\u201d she says, wandering over to the almost-empty mantelpiece. \u201cYou must have done!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA... a fair amount,\u201d I say evasively. \u201cYou know. I was quite ruthless in the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so impressed!\u201d She pauses in front of the wardrobe, and I stare at her, suddenly nervous.</p><p>Don\u2019t open it, I pray silently. Just don\u2019t open it.</p><p>\u201cHave you got anything left?\u201d she says, with a grin, and pulls open the door of the wardrobe. And we both scream.</p> <p>It\u2019s like a nail-bomb explosion.</p><p>Except, instead of nails, it\u2019s clothes.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what happened. I don\u2019t know what I did wrong. But one of the bags bursts open, showering jumpers everywhere, and pushing all the other bags out. Then another one bursts open, and another one. It\u2019s a clothes storm. Suze is completely covered in stretchy tops. A sequinned skirt lands on the light shade. A bra shoots across the room and hits the window. Suze is half-shrieking and half-laughing, and I\u2019m flapping my arms madly and yelling, \u201cStop! Stop!\u201d</p><p>And oh no.</p><p>Oh no. Please stop. Please.</p><p>But it\u2019s too late. Now a cascade of gift-shop carrier bags is tumbling down from their hiding place on the top shelf. One after another, out into the daylight. They\u2019re hitting Suze on the head, landing on the floor, and spilling open \u2014 and revealing the same contents in each. Gray sparkly boxes with a silver S C-S scrawled on the front.</p><p>About forty of them.</p><p>\u201cWhat...\u201d Suze pulls a T-shirt off her head and stares at them, open-mouthed. \u201cWhere on earth did you...\u201d She scrabbles among the clothes littering the floor, picks up one of the boxes, and pulls it open and stares in silence. There, wrapped in turquoise tissue paper, is a photo frame made out of tan leather.</p> <p>Oh God. Oh God.</p><p>Without saying anything, Suze bends down and picks up a Gifts and Goodies carrier bag. As she pulls it open, a receipt flutters to the floor. Silently she takes out the two boxes inside \u2014 and opens each to reveal a frame made of purple tweed.</p><p>I open my mouth to speak \u2014 but nothing comes out. For a moment we just stare at each other.</p><p>\u201cBex... how many of these have you got?\u201d says Suze at last, in a slightly strangled voice.</p><p>\u201cUm... not many!\u201d I say, feeling my face grow hot. \u201cJust... you know. A few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere must be about... fifty here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d She looks around, cheeks growing pink with distress. \u201cBex, these are really expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t bought that many!\u201d I give a distracting laugh. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t buy them all at once...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have bought any! I told you, I\u2019d make you one!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say a little awkwardly. \u201cI know you did. But I wanted to buy one. I just wanted to... to support you.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence as Suze reaches for another Gifts and Goodies bag, and looks at the two boxes inside.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she says suddenly. \u201cYou\u2019re the reason I\u2019ve sold so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not! Honestly, Suze\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve spent all your money on buying my frames.\u201d Her voice starts to wobble. \u201cAll your money. And now you\u2019re in debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for you, I wouldn\u2019t have my deal!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would!\u201d I say in dismay. \u201cOf course you would! Suze, you make the best frames in the world! I mean... look at this one!\u201d I grab for the nearest box and pull out a frame made out of distressed denim. \u201cI would have bought this even if I hadn\u2019t known you.

You\u2019re so talented, and successful...\u201d I look around my bomb-site room, and feel a sudden wave of despair. \u201cAnd I\u2019m such a mess. John Gavin\u2019s right, I should have assets by now. I should be all sorted out. I\u2019m just... worthless.\u201d Tears start to trickle down my face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not!\u201d says Suze in horror. \u201cYou\u2019re not worthless!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am!\u201d Miserably, I sink to the carpet of clothes on the floor. \u201cSuze, just look at me. I\u2019m unemployed, I haven\u2019t got any prospects, I\u2019m being taken to court, I owe thousands and thousands of pounds, and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m even going to start paying it all off...\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s an awkward cough at the door. I look up, and Tarquin is standing at the door, holding three mugs of coffee.</p><p>\u201cRefreshments?\u201d he says, picking his way across the floor.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Tarquin,\u201d I say, sniffing, and take a mug from him. \u201cSorry about all this. It\u2019s just... not a great time.\u201d</p><p>He sits down on the bed and exchanges looks with Suze.</p><p>\u201cBit short of cash?\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I gulp, and wipe my eyes. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d Tarquin gives Suze another glance.</p><p>\u201cBecky, I\u2019d be only too happy to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, thanks.\u201d I smile at him. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence as we all sip our coffee. A shaft of winter sunlight is coming through the window, and I close my eyes, feeling the soothing warmth on my face.</p><p>\u201cHappens to the best of us,\u201d says Tarquin sympathetically. \u201cMad Uncle Monty was always going bust, wasn\u2019t he, Suze?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, that\u2019s right! All the time!\u201d says Suze. \u201cBut he always bounced back, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d says Tarquin. \u201cOver and over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d I say, looking up with a spark of interest.</p> <p>\u201cUsually sold off a Rembrandt,\u201d says Tarquin. \u201cOr a Stubbs. Something like that.\u201d</p><p>Great. What is it about these millionaires? I mean, even Suze, who I love. They just don\u2019t get it. They don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have no money.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, trying to smile. \u201cWell... unfortunately, I don\u2019t have any spare Rembrandts lying around.

And some Tshirts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a fencing outfit,\u201d puts in Suze.</p><p>Next door, the phone starts ringing, but none of us move.</p><p>\u201cAnd a wooden bowl which I hate.\u201d I give a half-giggle, half-sob. \u201cAnd forty photograph frames.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd fifty million pots of lavender honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a Vera Wang cocktail dress.\u201d I look around my room, suddenly alert. \u201cAnd a brand-new Kate Spade bag... and... and a whole wardrobe full of stuff which I\u2019ve never even worn... Suze...\u201d I\u2019m almost too agitated to speak. \u201cSuze...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust... just think about it. I haven\u2019t got nothing. I have got assets! I mean, they might have depreciated a little bit...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d says Suze puzzledly \u2014 then her face lights up. \u201cOoh, have you got an ISA that you forgot about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Not an ISA!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand!\u201d wails Suze. \u201cBex, what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m just opening my mouth to answer, when the answer machine clicks on next door, and a gravelly American voice starts speaking, which makes me stiffen and turn my head.</p><p>\u201cHello, Becky? It\u2019s Michael Ellis here. I\u2019ve just arrived in London for a conference, and I was wondering \u2014 could we perhaps meet up for a chat?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s so weird to see Michael here in London. In my mind he belongs firmly in New York, in the Four Seasons. Back in that other world. But here he is, large as life, in the River Room at the Savoy, his face creased in a beam. As I sit down at the table he lifts a hand to a waiter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA gin and tonic for the lady, please.\u201d He raises his eyebrows at me. \u201cAm I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d I smile at him gratefully, and shake out my napkin to cover my awkwardness. Even though we talked so much in New York, I\u2019m feeling a bit shy at seeing him again.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he says, as the waiter brings me my drink. \u201cQuite a lot has been going on since we last spoke.\u201d He lifts his glass. \u201cCheers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheers.\u201d I take a sip. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike Alicia Billington and four others have been fired from Brandon Communications.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour others?\u201d I gape at him. \u201cWere they all planning together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently so. It turns out Alicia has been working on this little project for some time. This wasn\u2019t just some tiny little pie-in-the-sky scheme. This was well organized and thought out. Well backed, too. You know Alicia\u2019s future husband is very wealthy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d I say, and remember her Chanel shoes. \u201cBut it makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe put together the finance. As you suspected, they were planning to poach Bank of London.\u201d</p> <p>I take a sip of gin and tonic, relishing the sharp flavor.</p><p>\u201cSo what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke swooped in, took them all by surprise, herded them into a meeting room, and searched their desks. And he found plenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke did?\u201d I feel a deep thud in my stomach. \u201cYou mean \u2014 Luke\u2019s in London?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has he been back?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThree days now.\u201d Michael gives me a quick glance. \u201cI guess he hasn\u2019t called you, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, trying to hide my disappointment. \u201cNo, he hasn\u2019t.\u201d I reach for my glass and take a deep swig. Somehow while he was still in New York, I could tell myself that Luke and I weren\u2019t speaking because of geography as much as anything else. But now he\u2019s in London \u2014 and he hasn\u2019t even called \u2014 it feels different. It feels kind of... final.</p><p>\u201cSo... what\u2019s he doing now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamage limitation,\u201d says Michael wryly. \u201cUpping morale. It turns out as soon as he left for New York, Alicia got busy spreading rumors he was going to close the U.K. branch down completely. That\u2019s why the atmosphere plummeted. Clients have been neglected, the staff has all been on the phone to headhunters... Meanwhile Alicia was spinning a completely different story to Luke.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cThat girl is trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, that\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wondering. How do you know?\u201d He leans forward interestedly. \u201cYou picked up on Alicia in a way neither Luke nor I did. Was that based on anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I say honestly. \u201cJust the fact that she\u2019s a complete cow.\u201d</p><p>Michael throws his head back and roars with laughter.</p> <p>\u201cFeminine intuition. Why should there be any other reason?\u201d</p><p>He chuckles for a few moments more \u2014 then puts his glass down and gives me a twinkling smile. \u201cSpeaking of which \u2014 I heard the gist of what you said to Luke about his mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I look at him in horror. \u201cHe told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe spoke to me about it, asked if you\u2019d said anything to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I feel a flush creeping across my face. \u201cWell, I was... angry. I didn\u2019t mean to say she was a...\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cI just spoke without thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took it to heart, though.\u201d Michael raises his eyebrows. \u201cHe called his mom up, said he was damned if he was going to go home without seeing her, and arranged a meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I stare at him, feeling prickles of intrigue. \u201cAnd what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe never showed up. Sent some message about having to go out of town. Luke was pretty disappointed.\u201d Michael shakes his head. \u201cBetween you and me \u2014 I think you were right about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well.\u201d</p><p>I give an awkward shrug and reach for the menu to hide my embarrassment. I can\u2019t believe Luke told Michael what I said about his mother. What else did he tell him? My bra size?</p><p>For a while I stare at the list of dishes without taking any of them in \u2014 then look up, to see Michael gazing seriously at me.</p><p>\u201cBecky, I haven\u2019t told Luke it was you who tipped me off. The story I\u2019ve given him is I got an anonymous message and decided to look into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds fair enough,\u201d I say, gazing at the tablecloth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re basically responsible for saving his company,\u201d says Michael gently. \u201cHe should be very grateful to you.

Obviously not.</p><p>\u201cWhat would he think?\u201d probes Michael.</p> <p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d I mutter gruffly. \u201cThe point is, it\u2019s all over between us. So I\u2019d rather just... not be involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess I can understand that.\u201d Michael gives me a kind look. \u201cShall we order?\u201d</p><p>While we eat, we talk about other things. Michael tells me about his advertising agency in Washington, and makes me laugh with stories of all the politicians he knows and all the trouble they get themselves into. I tell him in turn about my family, and Suze, and the way I got my job on Morning Coffee.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all going really well, actually,\u201d I say boldly as I dig into a chocolate mousse. \u201cI\u2019ve got great prospects, and the producers really like me... they\u2019re thinking of expanding my slot...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky,\u201d interrupts Michael gently. \u201cI heard. I know about your job.\u201d</p> <p>I stare at him dumbly, feeling my whole face prickle in shame.</p><p>\u201cI felt really bad for you,\u201d continues Michael. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes... does Luke know?\u201d I say huskily.</p><p>\u201cYes. I believe he does.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep swig of my drink. I can\u2019t bear the idea of Luke pitying me.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got lots of options open,\u201d I say desperately. \u201cI mean, maybe not on television... but I\u2019m applying for a number of financial journalism posts...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOn the FT?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn... well... on Personal Investment Periodical... and Annuities Today...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnuities Today,\u201d echoes Michael disbelievingly. At his expression I can\u2019t help giving a snort of shaky laughter. \u201cBecky, do any of these jobs really excite you?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m about to trot out my stock answer\u2014\u201cPersonal finance is more interesting than you\u2019d think, actually!\u201d But suddenly I realize I can\u2019t be bothered to pretend anymore. Personal finance isn\u2019t more interesting than you\u2019d think. It\u2019s just as boring as you\u2019d think. Even on Morning Coffee, it was only really when callers started talking about their relationships and family lives that I used to enjoy it.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d I say instead, and take another swig of gin and tonic.</p><p>Michael sits back in his chair and dabs his mouth with a napkin. \u201cSo why are you going for them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d I give a hopeless shrug. \u201cPersonal finance is the only thing I\u2019ve ever done.

Thoughtfully, Michael reaches for a chocolate mint, unwraps it, and puts it in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cBecky, I have a proposition for you,\u201d he says, looking up. \u201cWe have an opening at the advertising agency for a head of corporate communications.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, glass halfway to my lips. Not daring to hope he\u2019s saying what I think he is.</p><p>\u201cWe want someone with editorial skills, who can coordinate a monthly newsletter. You\u2019d be ideal on those counts. But we also want someone who\u2019s good with people. Someone who can pick up on the buzz, make sure people are happy, report to the board on any problems...\u201d He shrugs. \u201cFrankly, I can\u2019t think of anyone better suited to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re... you\u2019re offering me a job,\u201d I say disbelievingly, trying to ignore the little leaps of hope inside my chest, the little stabs of excitement. \u201cBut... but what about The Daily World? The... shopping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Michael shrugs. \u201cSo you like to shop. I like to eat. Nobody\u2019s perfect. As long as you\u2019re not on some international \u2018most wanted\u2019 blacklist...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No,\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m about to sort all that out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd immigration?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a lawyer.\u201d I bite my lip. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he exactly likes me very much...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have contacts in immigration,\u201d says Michael reassuringly. \u201cI\u2019m sure we can sort something out.\u201d He leans back and takes a sip of coffee. \u201cWashington isn\u2019t New York. But it\u2019s a fun place to be, too. Politics is a fascinating arena. I have a feeling you\u2019d take to it. And the salary... Well. It won\u2019t be what CNN might have offered you. But as a ballpark...\u201d He scribbles a figure on a piece of paper and pushes it across the table.</p><p>And I don\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s about twice what I\u2019d get for any of those crappy journalism jobs.</p> <p>Washington. An advertising agency. A whole new career.</p><p>America. Without Luke. On my own terms.</p><p>I can\u2019t quite get my head round all of this.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you offering this to me?\u201d I manage at last.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been very impressed by you, Becky,\u201d says Michael seriously. \u201cYou\u2019re smart. You\u2019re intuitive. I took your advice about my friend, by the way,\u201d he adds with a twinkle. \u201cHe paid up the next day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say in delight.</p><p>\u201cYou have a good head on your shoulders \u2014 and you\u2019re someone who gets things done.\u201d I stare at him, feeling an embarrassed color come to my cheeks. \u201cAnd maybe I figured you deserve a break,\u201d he adds kindly. \u201cNow, you don\u2019t have to decide at once. I\u2019m over here for a few more days, so if you want to, we can talk again about it. But, Becky\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious now. Whether you decide to take up my offer or not, don\u2019t fall into anything else.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cYou\u2019re too young to settle. Look into your heart \u2014 and go after what you really want.\u201d</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>I DON\u2019T DECIDE straight away. It takes me about two weeks of pacing around the flat, drinking endless cups of coffee, talking to my parents, Suze, Michael, my old boss Philip, this new television agent Cassandra... basically everyone I can think of. But in the end I know. I know in my heart what I really want to do.</p> <p>Luke hasn\u2019t called \u2014 and to be honest, I shouldn\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever speak to him again. Michael says he\u2019s working about seventeen hours a day \u2014 trying simultaneously to salvage Brandon Communications and keep interest open in the States \u2014 and is very stressed indeed. Apparently he still hasn\u2019t got over the shock of discovering that Alicia was plotting against him \u2014 and that Bank of London was still considering moving with her. The shock of discovering he wasn\u2019t \u201cimmune to shit,\u201d as Michael so poetically put it. \u201cThat\u2019s the trouble with having the whole world love you,\u201d he said to me the other day. \u201cOne day, you wake up and it\u2019s flirting with your best friend instead. And you don\u2019t know what to do. You\u2019re thrown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo \u2014 has Luke been thrown by all this?\u201d I asked, twisting my fingers into a knot.</p><p>\u201cThrown?\u201d exclaimed Michael. \u201cHe\u2019s been hurled across the paddock and trampled on by a herd of wild boar.\u201d</p><p>Several times I\u2019ve picked up the phone with a sudden longing to speak to him. But then I\u2019ve always taken a deep breath and put it down again. That\u2019s his life now. I\u2019ve got to get on with mine. My whole new life.</p><p>There\u2019s a sound at the door, and I look round. Suze is standing in the doorway, staring into my empty room.</p><p>\u201cOh, Bex,\u201d she says miserably. \u201cI don\u2019t like it. Put it all back. Make it messy again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least it\u2019s all feng shui now,\u201d I say, attempting a smile. \u201cIt\u2019ll probably bring you loads of luck.\u201d</p><p>She comes in and walks across the empty carpet to the window, then turns round.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems smaller,\u201d she says slowly. \u201cIt should look bigger without all your clutter, shouldn\u2019t it? But somehow... it doesn\u2019t work like that. It looks like a nasty bare little box.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence for a while as I watch a tiny spider climbing up the windowpane.</p><p>\u201cHave you decided what you\u2019re going to do with it?\u201d I say at last. \u201cAre you going to get a new flatmate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d says Suze. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s no rush, is there. Tarkie said why not just have it as my office for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he?\u201d I turn to look at her with raised eyebrows. \u201cThat reminds me. Did I hear Tarquin here again last night? And creeping out this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Suze, looking flustered. \u201cI mean \u2014 yes.\u201d She catches my eye and blushes. \u201cBut it was completely the last ever time. Ever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou make such a lovely couple,\u201d I say, grinning at her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that!\u201d she exclaims in horror. \u201cWe\u2019re not a couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say, relenting. \u201cWhatever.\u201d I look at my watch. \u201cYou know, we ought to be going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.

Then I reach for my coat. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>We walk along to the King George pub at the end of the road. We make our way through the bar and up a flight of wooden stairs to a large private room furnished with red velvet curtains, a bar, and lots of trestle tables set up on both sides. A makeshift platform has been set up at one end, and there are rows of plastic chairs in the middle.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d says Tarquin, spotting us as we enter. \u201cCome and have a drink.\u201d He lifts his glass. \u201cThe red\u2019s not at all bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the tab all set up behind the bar?\u201d says Suze.</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d says Tarquin. \u201cAll organized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex \u2014 that\u2019s on us,\u201d says Suze, putting her hand on me as I reach for my purse. \u201cA good-bye present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuze, you don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to,\u201d she says firmly. \u201cSo did Tarkie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get you some drinks,\u201d says Tarquin \u2014 then adds, lowering his voice, \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good turnout, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>As he walks off, Suze and I turn to survey the room. There are tables set out round the room, and people are milling around, looking at neatly folded piles of clothes, shoes, CDs, and assorted bits of bric-a-brac. On one table is a pile of typed, photocopied catalogues, and people are marking them as they wander round.</p> <p>I can hear a girl in leather jeans saying, \u201cLook at this coat! Ooh, and these Hobbs boots! I\u2019m definitely going to bid for those!\u201d On the other side of the room, two girls are trying pairs of trousers up against themselves while their boyfriends patiently hold their drinks.</p><p>\u201cWho are all these people?\u201d I say disbelievingly. \u201cDid you invite them all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I went down my address book,\u201d says Suze. \u201cAnd Tarquin\u2019s address book. And Fenny\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh well,\u201d I say with a laugh. \u201cThat explains it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Becky!\u201d says a bright voice behind me \u2014 and I swivel round to see Fenella\u2019s friend Milla, with a pair of girls I half-recognize. \u201cI\u2019m going to bid for your purple cardigan! And Tory\u2019s going to go for that dress with the fur, and Annabel\u2019s seen about six thousand things she wants! We were just wondering, is there an accessories section?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver there,\u201d says Suze, pointing to the corner of the room.</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d says Milla. \u201cSee you later!\u201d The three girls trip off into the melee, and I hear one of them saying, \u201cI really need a good belt...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d says Tarquin, suddenly coming up behind me. \u201cHere\u2019s some wine. And let me introduce Caspar, my chum from Christie\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh hello!\u201d I say, turning round to see a guy with floppy blond hair, a blue shirt, and an enormous gold signet ring. \u201cThank you so much for doing this! I\u2019m really grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, not at all,\u201d says Caspar. \u201cNow, I\u2019ve been through the catalogue and it all seems fairly straightforward. Do you have a list of reserve prices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say without pausing. \u201cNo reserves. Everything must go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He smiles at me. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll go and get set up.\u201d</p><p>As he walks off I take a sip of my wine. Suze has gone off to look round some of the tables, so I stand alone for a while, watching as the crowd grows. Fenella arrives at the door, and I give her a wave \u2014 but she\u2019s immediately swallowed up in a group of shrieking friends.</p><p>\u201cHi, Becky,\u201d comes a hesitant voice behind me. I wheel round in shock, and find myself staring up at Tom Webster.</p><p>\u201cTom!\u201d I exclaim in shock. \u201cWhat are you doing here? How do you know about this?\u201d He takes a sip from his glass and gives a little grin.</p><p>\u201cSuze called your mum, and she told me all about it. She and my mum have put in some orders, actually.\u201d He pulls a list out of his pocket. \u201cYour mum wants your cappuccino maker. If it\u2019s for sale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s for sale,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll tell the auctioneer to make sure you get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my mum wants that pink hat you wore to our wedding.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight.

Wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose so.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s an awkward silence between us. In the distance I can hear someone saying, \u201cKate Spade! Look, brand new!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, I\u2019m really sorry,\u201d says Tom in a rush. \u201cThe way we behaved toward you at the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right!\u201d I say, a little too brightly.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not all right.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cYour mum was bang on. You\u2019re one of my oldest friends. I\u2019ve been feeling really bad, ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Tom. It was my fault, too. I mean, I should have just admitted Luke wasn\u2019t there!\u201d I smile ruefully. \u201cIt would have been a lot simpler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if Lucy was giving you a hard time, I can really understand why you felt you just had to... to...\u201d He breaks off, and takes a deep swig of his drink. \u201cAnyway. Luke seemed like a nice guy. Is he coming tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say after a pause, and force a smile. \u201cNo, he isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>After half an hour or so, people begin to take their seats on the rows of plastic chairs. At the back of the room are five or six friends of Tarquin\u2019s holding mobile phones, and Caspar explains to me that they\u2019re on the line to telephone bidders.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re people who heard about it but couldn\u2019t come, for whatever reason. We\u2019ve been circulating the catalogues fairly widely, and a lot of people are interested. The Vera Wang dress alone attracted a great deal of attention.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, feeling a sudden lurch of emotion, \u201cI expect it did.\u201d I look around the room, at the bright, expectant faces, at the people still taking a last look at the tables. A girl is leafing through a pile of jeans; someone else is trying out the clasp on my dinky little white case. I can\u2019t quite believe that after tonight, none of these things will be mine anymore. They\u2019ll be in other people\u2019s wardrobes. Other people\u2019s rooms.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d says Caspar, following my gaze.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say brightly. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of house sales,\u201d he says kindly. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like. One gets very attached to one\u2019s possessions. Whether it\u2019s an eighteenth-century chiffonier, or...\u201d He glances at the catalogue. \u201cA pink leopard-print coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually \u2014 I never much liked that coat.\u201d I gave him a resolute smile. \u201cAnd anyway, that\u2019s not the point. I want to start again and I think \u2014 I know \u2014 this is the best way.\u201d I smile at him. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s get going, shall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d He raps on his lectern and raises his voice. \u201cLadies and gentlemen! First, on behalf of Becky Bloomwood, I\u2019d like to welcome you all here this evening. We\u2019ve got quite a lot to get through, so I won\u2019t delay you \u2014 except to remind you that 25 percent of everything raised tonight is going to a range of charities \u2014 plus any remainder of the proceeds after Becky has paid off all her outstanding accounts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope they\u2019re not holding their breath,\u201d says a dry voice from the back, and everyone laughs. I peer through the crowd to see who it is \u2014 and I don\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s Derek Smeath, standing there with a pint in one hand, a catalogue in the other. He gives me a little smile, and I give a shy wave back.</p><p>\u201cHow did he know about this?\u201d I hiss to Suze, who has come to join me on the platform.</p> <p>\u201cI told him, of course!\u201d she says. \u201cHe said he thought it was a marvelous idea. He said when you use your brain, no one comes near you for ingenuity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I glance at Derek Smeath again and flush slightly.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d says Caspar. \u201cI present Lot One. A pair of clementine sandals, very good condition, hardly worn.\u201d He lifts them onto the table and Suze squeezes my hand sympathetically. \u201cDo I have any bids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bid \u00a315,000,\u201d says Tarquin, sticking up his hand at once.</p><p>\u201cFifteen thousand pounds,\u201d says Caspar, sounding a bit taken aback. \u201cI have a bid of \u00a315,000\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t!\u201d I interrupt. \u201cTarquin, you can\u2019t bid \u00a315,000!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to bid realistic prices.\u201d I give him a stern look. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019ll be banned from the bidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK... \u00a31,000.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!

Any further bids on 30...\u201d Caspar looks around the room, his eyes suddenly like a hawk\u2019s. \u201cGoing... going... gone! To the girl in the green velvet coat.\u201d He grins at me, scribbles something on a piece of paper, and hands the shoes to Fenella, who is in charge of distributing sold items.</p><p>\u201cYour first \u00a330!\u201d whispers Suze in my ear.</p><p>\u201cLot Two!\u201d says Caspar. \u201cThree embroidered cardigans from Jigsaw, unworn, with price tags still attached. Can I start the bidding at...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty pounds!\u201d says a girl in pink.</p> <p>\u201cTwenty-five!\u201d cries another girl.</p><p>\u201cI have a telephone bid of 30,\u201d says a guy raising his hand at the back.</p><p>\u201cThirty pounds from one of our telephone bidders... Any advance on 30? Remember, ladies and gentlemen, this will be raising funds for charity...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-five!\u201d cries the girl in pink, and turns to her neighbor. \u201cI mean, they\u2019d be more than that each in the shop, wouldn\u2019t they? And they\u2019ve never even been worn!\u201d</p><p>God, she\u2019s right. I mean, thirty-five quid for three cardigans is nothing. Nothing!</p><p>\u201cForty!\u201d I hear myself crying, before I can stop myself. The whole room turns to look at me, and I feel myself furiously blushing. \u201cI mean... does anyone want to bid 40?\u201d</p><p>The bidding goes on and on, and I can\u2019t believe how much money is being raised. My shoe collection raises at least \u00a31,000, a set of Dinny Hall jewelry goes for \u00a3200\u2014and Tom Webster bids \u00a3600 for my computer.</p><p>\u201cTom,\u201d I say anxiously, as he comes up to the platform to fill in his slip. \u201cTom, you shouldn\u2019t have bid all that money.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor a brand-new Apple Mac?\u201d says Tom. \u201cIt\u2019s worth it. Besides, Lucy\u2019s been saying she wants her own computer for a while.\u201d He gives a half-smile. \u201cI\u2019m kind of looking forward to telling her she\u2019s got your castoff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLot Seventy-three,\u201d says Caspar beside me. \u201cAnd one which I know is going to attract a great deal of interest. A Vera Wang cocktail dress.\u201d He slowly holds up the inky purple dress, and there\u2019s an appreciative gasp from the crowd.</p><p>But actually \u2014 I don\u2019t think I can watch this go. This is too painful, too recent. My beautiful glittering movie-star dress. I can\u2019t even look at it without remembering it all, like a slow-motion cine-film. Dancing with Luke in New York; drinking cocktails; that heady, happy excitement. And then waking up and seeing everything crash around me.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I murmur, and get to my feet. I head quickly out of the room, down the stairs, and into the fresh evening air. I lean against the side of the pub, listening to the laughter and chatter inside, and take a few deep breaths, trying to focus on all the good reasons why I\u2019m doing this.</p><p>A few moments later, Suze appears beside me.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d she says, and hands me a glass of wine. \u201cHere. Have some of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say gratefully, and take a deep gulp. \u201cI\u2019m fine, really. It\u2019s just... I suppose it\u2019s just hitting me. What I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex...\u201d She pauses and rubs her face awkwardly. \u201cBex, you could always change your mind. You could always stay. I mean \u2014 after tonight, with any luck, all your debts will be paid off! You could get a job, stay in the flat with me...\u201d</p><p>I look at her for a few silent moments, feeling a temptation so strong, it almost hurts. It would be so easy to agree. Go home with her, have a cup of tea, and fall back into my old life.</p><p>But then I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not going to fall into anything again. I\u2019ve found something I really want to do, Suze, and I\u2019m going to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca.\u201d A voice interrupts us, and we both look up to see Derek Smeath coming out of the door of the pub. He\u2019s holding the wooden bowl, one of Suze\u2019s photograph frames, and a big hard-backed atlas which I remember buying once when I thought I might give up my Western life and go traveling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say, and nod at his haul. \u201cYou did well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d He holds the bowl up. \u201cThis is a very handsome piece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was in Elle Decoration once,\u201d I tell him. \u201cVery cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?

Everything.\u201d</p><p>He nods, and then walks off into the night.</p> <p>I stay outside with Suze for quite a time. People are leaving now, carrying their loot, and telling each other how much they got it all for. A guy walks by clutching the mini paper shredder, a girl drags a bin liner full of clothes, someone else has got the invitations with the twinkly pizza slices. Just as I\u2019m starting to get cold, a voice hails us from the stairs.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d calls Tarquin. \u201cIt\u2019s the last lot. D\u2019you want to come and see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d says Suze, stubbing out her cigarette. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to see the last thing go. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say as we mount the stairs. \u201cThe fencing mask, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>But as we walk back into the room, I feel a jolt of shock. Caspar\u2019s holding up my Denny and George scarf. My precious Denny and George scarf. Shimmering blue, silky velvet, overprinted in a paler blue, and dotted with iridescent beading.</p><p>I stand staring at it, with a growing tightness in my throat, remembering with a painful vividness the day I bought it. How desperately I wanted it. How Luke lent me the twenty quid I needed. The way I told him I was buying it for my aunt.</p> <p>The way he used to look at me whenever I wore it.</p><p>My eyes are going blurry, and I blink hard, trying to keep control of myself.</p><p>\u201cBex... don\u2019t sell your scarf,\u201d says Suze, looking at it in distress. \u201cKeep one thing, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLot 126,\u201d says Caspar. \u201cA very attractive silk and velvet scarf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex, tell them you\u2019ve changed your mind!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t changed my mind,\u201d I say, staring fixedly ahead. \u201cThere\u2019s no point hanging on to it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I bid for this fine designer accessory by Denny and George?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDenny and George!\u201d says the girl in pink, looking up. She\u2019s got the hugest pile of clothes around her, and I\u2019ve no idea how she\u2019s going to get them all home. \u201cI collect Denny and George! Thirty pounds!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have a bid at \u00a330,\u201d says Caspar. He looks around the room \u2014 but it\u2019s swiftly emptying. People are queueing up to collect their items, or buy drinks at the bar, and the very few left sitting on the chairs are mostly chatting.</p><p>\u201cAny further bids for this Denny and George scarf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d says a voice at the back, and I see a girl in black raising a hand. \u201cI have a telephone bid of \u00a335.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForty pounds,\u201d says the girl in pink promptly.</p><p>\u201cFifty,\u201d says the girl in black.</p><p>\u201cFifty?\u201d says the pink girl, swiveling on her chair. \u201cWho is it bidding? Is it Miggy Sloane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bidder wishes to remain anonymous,\u201d says the girl in black after a pause. She catches my eye and for an instant my heart stops still.</p><p>\u201cI bet it\u2019s Miggy,\u201d says the girl, turning back. \u201cWell, she\u2019s not going to beat me. Sixty pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixty pounds?\u201d says the chap next to her, who\u2019s been eyeing her pile of stuff with slight alarm. \u201cFor a scarf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Denny and George scarf, stupid!\u201d says the pink girl, and takes a swig of wine. \u201cIt would be at least two hundred in a shop. Seventy! Ooh, silly. It\u2019s not my turn, is it?\u201d</p><p>The girl in black has been murmuring quietly into the phone. Now she looks up at Caspar. \u201cA hundred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hundred?\u201d The pink girl swivels on her chair again. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bidding stands at one hundred,\u201d says Caspar calmly. \u201cI am bid \u00a3100 for this Denny and George scarf. Any further bids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hundred and twenty,\u201d says the pink girl. There are a few moments\u2019 silence, and the girl in black talks quietly into the phone again.

Bit of a change from early German porcelain.\u201d He gestures to his notes. \u201cI think we raised a fair bit, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did brilliantly!\u201d says Suze, coming to sit down too, and handing Caspar a beer. \u201cHonestly, Bex, you\u2019ll be completely out of the woods now.\u201d She gives an admiring sigh. \u201cYou know, it just shows, you were right all along. Shopping is an investment. I mean, like, how much did you make on your Denny and George scarf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm...\u201d I close my eyes, trying to work it out. \u201cAbout... 60 percent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixty percent return! In less than a year! You see? That\u2019s better than the crummy old stock market!\u201d She takes out a cigarette and lights it. \u201cYou know, I think I might sell all my stuff, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t got any stuff,\u201d I point out. \u201cYou decluttered it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Suze\u2019s face falls. \u201cGod, why did I do that?\u201d</p><p>I lean back on my elbow and close my eyes. Suddenly, for no real reason, I feel absolutely exhausted.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re off tomorrow,\u201d says Caspar, taking a swig of beer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m off tomorrow,\u201d I echo, staring up at the ceiling. Tomorrow I\u2019m leaving England and flying off to America to live. Leaving everything behind and starting again. Somehow, it just doesn\u2019t feel real.</p><p>\u201cNot one of these crack-of-dawn flights, I hope?\u201d he says, glancing at his watch.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank God. I\u2019m not flying until about five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d says Caspar, nodding. \u201cGives you plenty of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes.\u201d I sit up and glance at Suze, who grins back. \u201cPlenty of time for just a couple of little things I\u2019ve got to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky! We\u2019re so glad you changed your mind!\u201d cries Zelda as soon as she sees me. I get up from the sofa where I\u2019ve been sitting in reception, and give her a quick smile. \u201cEveryone\u2019s so thrilled you\u2019re coming on! What made you decide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not sure,\u201d I say pleasantly. \u201cJust... one of those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let me take you straight up to makeup... we\u2019re completely chaotic, as usual, so we\u2019ve brought your slot forward slightly...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d I say. \u201cThe sooner the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to say, you look very well,\u201d says Zelda, surveying me with a slight air of disappointment. \u201cHave you lost weight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh... stress,\u201d she says wisely. \u201cStress, the silent killer. We\u2019re doing a feature on it next week. Now!\u201d she exclaims, bustling me into the makeup room. \u201cThis is Becky...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cZelda, we know who Becky is,\u201d says Chloe, who\u2019s been doing my makeup ever since I first appeared on Morning Coffee. She pulls a face at me in the mirror and I stifle a giggle.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course you do! Sorry, Becky, I\u2019ve just got you down in my mind as a guest! Now, Chloe. Don\u2019t do too good a job on Becky today. We don\u2019t want her looking too glowing and happy, do we?\u201d She lowers her voice. \u201cAnd use waterproof mascara. In fact, everything waterproof. See you later!\u201d</p><p>Zelda sweeps out of the room, and Chloe shoots her a scornful glance.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you look as good as you\u2019ve ever looked in your life. Extra happy and extra glowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Chloe,\u201d I say, grinning at her, and sit down on a chair.</p> <p>\u201cOh, and please don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re really going to need waterproof mascara,\u201d she adds, tying a cape around me.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d I say firmly. \u201cThey\u2019ll have to shoot me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they probably will,\u201d says a girl from across the room, and we all start giggling helplessly.</p><p>\u201cAll I can say is, I hope they\u2019re paying you well to do this,\u201d says Chloe, as she starts to smooth foundation onto my skin.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cThey are, as it happens. But that\u2019s not why I\u2019m doing it.\u201d</p><p>Half an hour later, I\u2019m sitting in the Green Room when Clare Edwards comes walking in. She\u2019s wearing a dark green suit that really doesn\u2019t do much for her \u2014 and is it my imagination, or has someone made her up far too pale? She\u2019s going to look really pasty under the lights.</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d says Clare, looking discomfited as she sees me. \u201cHello, Becky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Clare,\u201d I say. \u201cLong time no see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Well.\u201d She twists her hands into a knot. \u201cI was very sorry to read of your troubles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say lightly. \u201cStill \u2014 it\u2019s an ill wind, eh, Clare?\u201d</p><p>Clare immediately blushes bright red and looks away \u2014 and I feel a bit ashamed of myself. It\u2019s not her fault I got sacked.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m really pleased you got the job,\u201d I say more kindly. \u201cAnd I think you\u2019re doing it really well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d says Zelda, hurrying in. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for you. Now, Becky.\u201d She puts a hand on my arm as we walk out. \u201cI know this is going to be very traumatic for you. We\u2019re quite prepared for you to take your time... again, if you break down completely, start sobbing, whatever... don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Zelda,\u201d I say, and nod seriously. \u201cI\u2019ll bear that in mind.\u201d</p> <p>We get to the set, and there are Rory and Emma, sitting on the sofas. I glance at a monitor as I walk past, and see that they\u2019ve blown up that awful picture of me in New York, tinted it red, and headlined it \u201cBecky\u2019s Tragic Secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Becky,\u201d says Emma, as I sit down, and pats me sympathetically on the hand. \u201cAre you all right? Would you like a tissue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm... no, thanks.\u201d I lower my voice. \u201cBut, you know. Perhaps later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrifically brave of you to come and do this,\u201d says Rory, and squints at his notes. \u201cIs it true your parents have disowned you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady in five,\u201d calls Zelda from the floor. \u201cFour... three...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome back,\u201d says Emma somberly to camera. \u201cNow, we\u2019ve got a very special guest with us today. Thousands of you will have followed the story of Becky Bloomwood, our former financial expert. Becky was, of course, revealed by The Daily World to be far from financially secure herself.\u201d</p><p>The picture of me shopping appears on the monitor, followed by a series of tabloid headlines, accompanied by the song \u201cHey Big Spender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Becky,\u201d says Emma, as the music dies away. \u201cLet me begin by saying how extremely sorry and sympathetic we are for you in your plight. In a minute, we\u2019ll be asking our new financial expert, Clare Edwards, just what you should have done to prevent this catastrophe. But now \u2014 just to put our viewers straight... could you tell us exactly how much in debt you are?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019d be glad to, Emma,\u201d I say, and take a deep breath. \u201cAt the present moment, my debt amounts to...\u201d I pause, and I can feel the whole studio bracing itself for a shock. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d Emma looks at Rory as though to check she\u2019s heard correctly. \u201cNothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy overdraft facilities director, John Gavin, will be glad to confirm that this morning, at nine thirty, I paid off my overdraft completely. I\u2019ve paid off every single debt I had.\u201d</p><p>I allow myself a tiny smile as I remember John Gavin\u2019s face this morning, as I handed over wads and wads of cash. I so wanted him to wriggle and squirm and look pissed off. But to give him his due, after the first couple of thousand he started smiling, and beckoning people round to watch. And at the end, he shook my hand really quite warmly \u2014 and said now he understood what Derek Smeath meant about me.</p> <p>I wonder what old Smeathie can have said?</p><p>\u201cSo you see, I\u2019m not really in a plight at all,\u201d I add. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ve never been better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight...\u201d says Emma. \u201cI see.\u201d There\u2019s a distracted look in her eye \u2014 and I know Barry must be yelling something in her earpiece.</p><p>\u201cBut even if your money situation is temporarily sorted out, your life must still be in ruins.\u201d She leans forward sympathetically again. \u201cYou\u2019re unemployed... shunned by your friends...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, I\u2019m not unemployed. This afternoon I\u2019m flying to the States, where I have a new career waiting for me. It\u2019s a bit of a gamble... and it\u2019ll certainly be a challenge. But I genuinely think I\u2019ll be happy there. And my friends...\u201d My voice wobbles a little, and I take a deep breath. \u201cIt was my friends who helped me out. It was my friends who stood by me.\u201d</p> <p>Oh God, I don\u2019t believe it. After all that, I\u2019ve got bloody tears in my eyes. I blink them back as hard as I can, and smile brightly at Emma.</p><p>\u201cSo really, my story isn\u2019t one of failure. Yes, I got myself into debt; yes, I was fired. But I did something about it.\u201d I turn to the camera. \u201cAnd I\u2019d like to say to anyone out there who\u2019s got themselves in a mess like I did... you can get out of it, too. Take action. Sell all your clothes. Apply for a new job. You can start again, like I\u2019m going to.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence around the studio. Then suddenly, from behind one of the cameras, there\u2019s the sound of clapping. I look over in shock \u2014 and it\u2019s Dave, the cameraman. He grins at me and mouths \u201cWell done.\u201d Suddenly Gareth the floor manager joins in... and someone else... and now the whole studio is applauding, apart from Emma and Rory, who are looking rather nonplussed \u2014 and Zelda, who\u2019s talking frantically into her mouthpiece.</p><p>\u201cWell!\u201d says Emma, over the sound of the applause. \u201cUm... We\u2019re taking a short break now \u2014 but join us in a few moments to hear more on our lead story today: Becky\u2019s...

The callers are all saying...\u201d She stares at me as though she\u2019s never seen me before. \u201cI mean, we had no idea. Who would ever have thought...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go, Zelda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait! Becky!\u201d says Zelda as I reach the door of the studio. \u201cWe... Barry and I... we were having a quick little chat just now. And we were wondering whether...\u201d</p><p>\u201cZelda,\u201d I interrupt gently. \u201cIt\u2019s too late.

I\u2019m still a little flushed from the farewell lunch I had in the pub with Suze, Tarquin, and my parents. To be honest, there\u2019s a small part of me that feels like bursting into tears and running back to them all. But at the same time, I\u2019ve never felt so confident in my life. I\u2019ve never been so sure I\u2019m doing the right thing.</p><p>There\u2019s a promotional stand in the center of the terminus, giving away free newspapers, and as I pass it, I reach for a Financial Times. Just for old times\u2019 sake. Plus, if I\u2019m carrying the FT, I might get upgraded. I\u2019m just folding it up to place it neatly under my arm, when I notice a name which makes me stop dead.</p><p>Brandon in bid to save company. Page 27.</p><p>With slightly shaky fingers, I unfold the paper, find the page, and read the story.</p> <p>Financial PR entrepreneur Luke Brandon is fighting to keep his investors on board after severe loss of confidence following the recent defection of several senior employees. Morale is said to be low at the formerly groundbreaking PR agency, with rumors of an uncertain future for the company causing staff to break ranks. In crisis meetings to be held today, Brandon will be seeking to persuade backers to approve his radical restructuring plans, which are said to involve...</p><p>I read to the end of the piece, and gaze for a few seconds at Luke\u2019s picture. He looks as confident as ever \u2014 but I remember Michael\u2019s remark about him being hurled across the paddock. His world\u2019s crashed around him, just like mine did. And chances are, his mum won\u2019t be on the phone telling him not to worry.</p><p>For a moment I feel a twinge of pity for him. I almost want to call him up and tell him things\u2019ll get better. But there\u2019s no point. He\u2019s busy with his life \u2014 and I\u2019m busy with mine. So I fold the paper up again, and resolutely walk forward to the checkin desk.</p><p>\u201cAnything to check?\u201d says the checkin girl, smiling at me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m traveling light. Just me and my bag.\u201d I casually lift my FT to a more prominent position. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s any chance of an upgrade?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot today, sorry.\u201d She pulls a sympathetic face. \u201cBut I can put you by the emergency exit. Plenty of legroom there. If I could just weigh your bag, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m just bending down to put my little case on the belt, when a familiar voice behind me exclaims, \u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>I feel a lurch inside as though I\u2019ve just dropped twenty feet. I turn disbelievingly \u2014 and it\u2019s him.</p><p>It\u2019s Luke, striding across the concourse toward the checkin desk. He\u2019s dressed as smartly as ever, but his face is pale and haggard. From the shadows under his eyes he looks as though he\u2019s been existing on a diet of late nights and coffee.</p><p>\u201cWhere the fuck are you going?\u201d he demands as he gets nearer. \u201cAre you moving to Washington?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I retort shakily. \u201cAren\u2019t you at some crisis meeting with your investors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was. Until Mel came in to hand round tea, and told me she\u2019d seen you on the television this morning. So I called Suze and got the flight number out of her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just left your meeting?\u201d I stare at him. \u201cWhat, right in the middle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me you\u2019re leaving the country.\u201d His dark eyes search my face. \u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, and clutch my little suitcase more tightly. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that? Without even telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, just like that,\u201d I say, plonking my case on the belt. \u201cJust like you came back to Britain without even telling me.\u201d There\u2019s an edge to my voice, and Luke flinches.</p><p>\u201cBecky\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWindow or aisle seat?\u201d interrupts the checkin girl.</p><p>\u201cWindow, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky\u2014\u201d</p><p>His mobile phone gives a shrill ring, and he switches it off irritably. \u201cBecky... I want to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you want to talk?\u201d I echo disbelievingly. \u201cGreat. Perfect timing. Just as I\u2019m checking in.\u201d I hit the FT with the back of my hand. \u201cAnd what about this crisis meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe future of your company can wait?\u201d I raise my eyebrows. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a little... irresponsible, Luke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy company wouldn\u2019t have a fucking future if it weren\u2019t for you,\u201d he exclaims, almost angrily, and in spite of myself I feel a tingling all over my body. \u201cI\u2019ve just been on the phone to Michael. He told me what you did. How you cottoned on to Alicia. How you warned him, how you sussed the whole thing.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI had no idea.

It was as though we didn\u2019t understand each other anymore.\u201d</p><p>I should be able to hear this without reacting. But for some reason the back of my throat feels tight all over again.</p><p>\u201cSo \u2014 what happened?\u201d I say, forcing myself to sound matter-of-fact. \u201cWhy are you here? The day when all your investors have flown in to see you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot ideal. I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d A flicker of amusement passes briefly across his face. \u201cBut how was I to know you were planning to skip the country? Michael\u2019s been a secretive bastard. And when I heard you were leaving...\u201d He meets my eyes. \u201cI suddenly realized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRealized... what?\u201d I manage.</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019d been a fucking... stupid...\u201d</p><p>He pushes his glass around the table abstractly, as though searching for something, and I stare at him apprehensively. \u201cYou were right,\u201d he says suddenly. \u201cI was obsessed with making it in New York. It was a kind of madness. I couldn\u2019t see anything else. Jesus, I\u2019ve fucked everything up, haven\u2019t I? You... us... the business...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Luke,\u201d I say awkwardly. \u201cYou can\u2019t take credit for everything. I fucked up a good few things for you...\u201d I stop as Luke shakes his head. He drains his glass and gives me a frank look.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something you need to know. Becky \u2014 how do you think The Daily World got hold of your financial details?\u201d</p><p>I look at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cIt... it was the council tax girl. The girl who came to the flat and snooped around while Suze was...\u201d I tail away as he shakes his head again.</p> <p>\u201cIt was Alicia.\u201d</p><p>For a moment I\u2019m too taken aback to speak.</p><p>\u201cAlicia?\u201d I manage at last. \u201cHow do you... why would she...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we searched her office we found some bank statements of yours in her desk. Some letters, too. Christ alone knows how she got hold of them.\u201d He exhales sharply. \u201cThis morning, I finally got a guy at The Daily World to admit she was the source. They just followed up what she gave them.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, feeling rather cold. Remembering that day I visited his office. The Conran bag with all my letters in it. Alicia standing by Mel\u2019s desk, looking like a cat with a mouse.</p><p>I knew I\u2019d left something behind. Oh God, how could I have been so stupid?</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t her real target,\u201d Luke\u2019s saying. \u201cShe did it to discredit me and the company \u2014 and distract my attention from what she was up to. They won\u2019t confirm it, but I\u2019m sure she was also the \u2018inside source\u2019 giving all those quotes about me.\u201d He takes a deep breath. \u201cThe point is, Becky \u2014 I got it all wrong. My deal wasn\u2019t ruined because of you.\u201d He looks at me matter-of-factly. \u201cYours was ruined because of me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sit still for a few moments, unable to speak.

It wasn\u2019t even Alicia\u2019s fault. Maybe she fed them the details. But I mean, if I hadn\u2019t got myself into debt in the first place, and if I hadn\u2019t gone crazy shopping in New York \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t have had anything to write about, would they?\u201d I rub my dry face. \u201cIt was horrible and humiliating. But in a funny way, seeing that article was a good thing for me. It made me realize a few things about myself, at least.\u201d</p><p>I pick up my glass, see that it\u2019s empty, and put it down again.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want another one?\u201d says Luke.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, thanks.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence between us. In the distance, a voice is telling passengers on flight BA 2340 for San Francisco to please proceed to Gate 29.</p><p>\u201cI know Michael offered you a job,\u201d said Luke. He gestures to my case. \u201cI assume this means you accepted it.\u201d He pauses, and I stare at him, trembling slightly, saying nothing. \u201cBecky \u2014 don\u2019t go to Washington. Come and work for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork for you?\u201d I say, startled.</p> <p>\u201cCome and work for Brandon Communications.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you mad?\u201d</p><p>He pushes his hair back off his face \u2014 and suddenly he looks young and vulnerable. Like someone who needs a break.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mad. My staff\u2019s been decimated. I need someone like you at a senior level. You know about finance. You\u2019ve been a journalist. You\u2019re good with people, you already know the company...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke, you\u2019ll easily find someone else like me,\u201d I chip in. \u201cYou\u2019ll find someone better! Someone with PR experience, someone who\u2019s worked in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, I\u2019m lying,\u201d Luke interrupts. \u201cI\u2019m lying.\u201d He takes a deep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t just need someone like you. I need you.\u201d</p> <p>He meets my eyes candidly \u2014 and with a jolt I realize he\u2019s not just talking about Brandon Communications.</p><p>\u201cI need you, Becky. I rely on you. I didn\u2019t realize it until you weren\u2019t there anymore. Ever since you left, your words have been going round and round in my head. About my ambitions. About our relationship. About my mother, even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother?\u201d I stare at him apprehensively. \u201cI heard you tried to arrange a meeting with her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t her fault.\u201d He takes a swig of Pernod. \u201cSomething came up, so she couldn\u2019t make it. But you\u2019re right, I should spend more time with her. Really get to know her better, and forge a closer relationship, just like you have with your mother.\u201d He looks up and frowns at my dumbfounded expression. \u201cThat is what you meant, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I try for a moment to imagine Luke and his mother chatting away in the kitchen like me and Mum \u2014 and fail completely.</p><p>\u201cErm... yes!\u201d I say hastily. \u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly what I meant. Absolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean. You\u2019re the only person who\u2019ll tell me the stuff I need to hear, even when I don\u2019t want to hear it. I should have confided in you right from the start. I was... I don\u2019t know. Arrogant. Stupid.\u201d</p><p>He sounds so bleak and hard on himself, I feel a twinge of dismay.</p> <p>\u201cLuke\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, I know you\u2019ve got your own career \u2014 and I completely respect that. I wouldn\u2019t even ask if I didn\u2019t think this could be a good step for you too. But... please.\u201d He reaches across the table and puts a warm hand on mine. \u201cCome back. Let\u2019s start again.\u201d</p><p>I stare helplessly at him, feeling emotion swelling in me like a balloon.</p><p>\u201cLuke, I can\u2019t work for you.\u201d I swallow, trying to keep control of my voice. \u201cI have to go to the States. I have to take this chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it seems like a great opportunity. But what I\u2019m offering could be a great opportunity, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d I say, clenching my hand tightly round my glass.</p><p>\u201cIt can be the same. Whatever Michael\u2019s offered you, I\u2019ll match it.\u201d He leans forward. \u201cI\u2019ll more than match it. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke,\u201d I interrupt. \u201cLuke, I didn\u2019t take Michael\u2019s job.\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s face jerks in shock.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t?

I want to tell him \u2014 but I just can\u2019t. I can\u2019t risk talking about it, listening to my own arguments waver, wondering whether I\u2019ve made the right choice.

You\u2019re right. I\u2019ll go. I\u2019ll go now.\u201d He stands up and reaches into his pocket. \u201cJust... one last thing. You don\u2019t want to forget this.\u201d</p><p>Very slowly, he pulls out a long, pale blue, silk and velvet scarf, scattered with iridescent beads.</p><p>My scarf. My Denny and George scarf.</p><p>I feel the blood drain from my face.</p><p>\u201cHow did you\u2014\u201d I swallow. \u201cThe bidder on the phone was you? But... but you withdrew.

For a few moments I sit without saying anything, doodling endless small five-pointed stars and letting my mind work it out, while Lalla watches me anxiously.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say at last. \u201cI have it. Your Helmut Lang pantsuit for the meetings, your Jil Sander dress for the lunch \u2014 and we\u2019ll find you something new for the dinner.\u201d I squint at her. \u201cMaybe something in a deep green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wear green,\u201d says Lalla.</p><p>\u201cYou can wear green,\u201d I say firmly. \u201cYou look great in green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky,\u201d says Erin, putting her head round my door. \u201cSorry to bother you, but Mrs. Farlow is on the phone. She loves the jackets you sent over \u2014 but is there something lighter she can wear for this evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll call her back.\u201d I look at Lalla. \u201cSo, let\u2019s find you an evening dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to wear with my pantsuit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA shirt,\u201d I say. \u201cOr a cashmere tee. The gray one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gray one,\u201d repeats Lalla carefully, as though I\u2019m speaking in Arabic.</p><p>\u201cYou bought it three weeks ago? Armani? Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes! Yes. I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr else your blue shell top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d says Lalla, nodding earnestly. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Lalla is high up in some top computer consultancy, with offices all over the world. She has two doctorates and an IQ of about a zillion \u2014 and claims she has severe clothes dyslexia. At first I thought she was joking.</p><p>\u201cWrite it down,\u201d she says, thrusting a leather-bound organizer at me. \u201cWrite down all the combinations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, OK... but, Lalla, I thought we were going to try to let you start putting a few outfits together yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I will. One day I will, I promise. Just... not this week. I can\u2019t deal with that extra pressure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say, hiding a smile, and begin to write in her organizer, screwing up my face as I try to remember all the clothes she\u2019s got. I haven\u2019t got much time if I\u2019m going to find her an evening dress for tonight, call Mrs. Farlow back, and locate that knitwear I promised for Janey van Hassalt.</p><p>Every day here is completely frenetic; everyone is always in a hurry. But somehow the busier I get, and the more challenges are thrown at me \u2014 the more I love it.</p><p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d says Lalla. \u201cMy sister \u2014 the one you said should wear burnt orange...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes! She was nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she saw you on the television. In England! Talking about clothes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d I say, feeling a faint flush come to my face. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing a little slot for a daytime lifestyle show. \u2018Becky from Barneys.\u2019 It\u2019s a kind of New York, fashiony thing...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell done!\u201d says Lalla warmly. \u201cA slot on television! That must be very exciting for you!\u201d</p><p>I pause, a beaded jacket in my hand, thinking, a few months ago I was going to have my own show on American network television. And now I have a little slot on a daytime show with half the audience of Morning Coffee. But the point is, I\u2019m on the path I want to be.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d I say, and smile at her. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting.\u201d</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take too long to sort Lalla out with an outfit for her dinner. As she leaves, clutching a list of possible shoes, Christina, the head of the department, comes in and smiles at me.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019re you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say. \u201cReally good.\u201d</p><p>Which is the truth. But even if it weren\u2019t \u2014 even if I were having the worst day in the world \u2014 I\u2019d never say anything negative to Christina. I\u2019m so grateful to her for remembering who I was. For giving me a chance.</p><p>I still can\u2019t quite believe how nice she was to me when I hesitantly phoned her up, out of the blue. I reminded her that we\u2019d met, and asked if there was any chance I could come and work at Barneys \u2014 and she said she remembered exactly who I was, and how was the Vera Wang dress? So I ended up telling her the whole story, and how I had to sell the dress, and how my TV career was in tatters, and how I\u2019d so love to come and work for her... and she was quiet for a bit \u2014 and then she said she thought I\u2019d be quite an asset to Barneys. Quite an asset! It was her idea about the TV slot, too.</p><p>\u201cHidden any clothes today?\u201d she says, with a slight twinkle, and I feel myself flush. I\u2019m never going to live this down, am I?</p> <p>It was during that first phone call that Christina also asked me if I had any retail experience. And like a complete moron, I told her all about the time I went to work in Ally Smith \u2014 and got the sack when I hid a pair of zebra-print jeans from a customer because I really wanted them myself. I came to the end of the story, and there was silence on the phone, and I thought I\u2019d completely scuppered my chances. But then came this bellow of laughter, so loud I almost dropped the phone in fright. She told me last week that was the moment she decided to hire me.</p><p>She\u2019s also told the story to all our regular clients, which is a bit embarrassing.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Christina gives me a long, appraising look. \u201cAre you ready for your ten o\u2019clock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I flush slightly under her gaze. \u201cYes, I think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you want to brush your hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d My hand flies to my neck. \u201cIs it untidy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot really.\u201d There\u2019s a slight sparkle to her eye, which I don\u2019t understand. \u201cBut you want to look your best for your customer, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She goes out of the room, and I quickly pull out a comb. God, I keep forgetting how tidy you have to be in Manhattan. Like, I have my nails done twice a week at a nail bar round the corner from where I live \u2014 but sometimes I think I should increase it to every other day. I mean, it\u2019s only nine dollars.</p><p>Which in real money, is... Well. It\u2019s nine dollars.</p><p>I\u2019m kind of getting used to thinking in dollars. I\u2019m kind of getting used to a lot of things. Jodie was a real star when I called her, and helped me find a studio apartment. It\u2019s tiny and pretty grotty and in a place called Hell\u2019s Kitchen (which I haven\u2019t told Mum. To her it\u2019s \u201cClinton,\u201d which she thinks sounds very nice and respectable.). For the first few nights I couldn\u2019t sleep for the traffic noise. But the point is, I\u2019m here. I\u2019m here in New York, standing on my own two feet, doing something I can honestly say I adore.</p><p>Michael\u2019s job in Washington sounded wonderful. In many ways it would have been much more sensible to take it \u2014 and I know Mum and Dad wanted me to. But what Michael said at that lunch \u2014 about not falling into anything else, about going after what I truly wanted \u2014 made me think. About my career, about my life, about what I really wanted to do for a living.</p><p>And to give my mum her due, as soon as I explained what this job at Barneys would involve, she stared at me, and said, \u201cBut, love, why on earth didn\u2019t you think of this before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Becky?\u201d I give a small start, and look up to see Erin at my door. I\u2019ve got to be quite good friends with Erin, ever since she invited me home to look at her collection of lipsticks and we ended up watching James Bond videos all night. \u201cI have your ten o\u2019clock here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is my ten o\u2019clock?\u201d I say, frowning puzzledly as I reach for a Richard Tyler sheath. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see anything in the book.\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell... uh...\u201d Her face is all shiny and excited, for some reason. \u201cUh... here he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you very much,\u201d comes a deep male voice.</p><p>A deep male British voice.</p><p>Oh my God.</p> <p>I freeze like a rabbit, still holding the Richard Tyler dress, as Luke walks into the room.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he says with a small smile. \u201cMiss Bloomwood.

This one is looking rather tired.\u201d</p><p>He gestures to his immaculate Jermyn Street suit, which I happen to know he\u2019s only had for three months, and I hide a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou want a suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p> <p>Playing for time, I put the dress back on a hanger, turn away, and place it carefully on the rail.

That\u2019s... that\u2019s very interesting. Because I had the impression that certain British businessmen were finding it tough to do deals with New York investors. Just... something I heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were.\u201d Luke nods. \u201cThey were finding it tough. But then they downscaled their plans. They decided to open on a much smaller scale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA smaller scale?\u201d I stare at him. \u201cAnd they didn\u2019t mind that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d says Luke after a pause, \u201cthey realized that they\u2019d been overambitious the first time round. Perhaps they realized that they\u2019d become obsessed to the point where they\u2019d let everything else suffer. Perhaps they realized they needed to swallow their pride and put away their grand plans \u2014 and slow down a little.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat... that makes a lot of sense,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cSo they put together a new proposal, found a backer who agreed with them, and this time nothing stood in the way. They\u2019re already up and running.\u201d</p><p>His face is gleaming with a suppressed delight, and I find myself beaming back.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d I say. \u201cI mean...\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cRight. I see.\u201d I scribble some nonsense in my notepad. \u201cSo \u2014 how much time are you going to be spending in New York, exactly?\u201d I add in a businesslike manner. \u201cFor my notes, you understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d says Luke, matching my tone. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be wanting to keep a significant presence in Britain. So I\u2019ll be here for two weeks a month. At least, that\u2019s the idea at the moment. It may be more, it may be less.\u201d There\u2019s a long pause and his dark eyes meet mine. \u201cIt all depends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn... on what?\u201d I say, scarcely able to breathe.</p><p>\u201cOn... various things.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a still silence between us.</p><p>\u201cYou seem very settled, Becky,\u201d says Luke quietly. \u201cVery... together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m enjoying it, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look as though you\u2019re flourishing.\u201d He looks around with a little smile. \u201cThis environment suits you. Which I suppose comes as no great surprise...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I took this job just because I like shopping?\u201d I say, raising my eyebrows. \u201cDo you think this is just about... shoes and nice clothes? Because if that\u2019s really what you think, then I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re sadly misguided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s far more than that. Far more.\u201d I spread my arms in an emphatic gesture. \u201cIt\u2019s about helping people. It\u2019s about being creative. It\u2019s about\u2014\u201d</p><p>A knock at the door interrupts me, and Erin pops her head in.</p><p>\u201cSorry to bother you, Becky. Just to let you know, I\u2019ve put aside those Donna Karan mules you wanted. In the taupe and the black, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm... yes,\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cYes, that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, and Accounts called, to say that takes you up to your discount limit for this month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, avoiding Luke\u2019s amused gaze. \u201cRight. Thanks. I\u2019ll... I\u2019ll deal with that later.\u201d And I wait for Erin to leave, but she\u2019s gazing with frank curiosity at Luke.</p><p>\u201cSo, how are you doing?\u201d she says to him brightly. \u201cHave you had a chance to look around the store?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to look,\u201d says Luke in a deadpan voice. \u201cI know what I want.\u201d</p><p>My stomach gives a little flip, and I stare straight down at my notebook, pretending to make more notes. Scribbling any old rubbish.</p> <p>\u201cOh right!\u201d says Erin. \u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long silence, and eventually I can\u2019t bear it anymore, I have to look up. As I see Luke\u2019s expression, my heart starts to thud.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been reading your literature,\u201d he says, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a leaflet entitled The Personal Shopping Service: For busy people who need some help and can\u2019t afford to make mistakes.</p><p>He pauses, and my hand tightens around my pen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made mistakes,\u201d he says, frowning slightly. \u201cI want to right those mistakes and not make them again. I want to listen to someone who knows me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy come to Barneys?\u201d I say in a trembling voice.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one person whose advice I trust.\u201d His gaze meets mine and I feel a small tremor. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t want to give it, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have Frank Walsh over in menswear,\u201d says Erin helpfully. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Erin,\u201d I say, without moving my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Becky?\u201d he says, moving toward me. \u201cWould you be interested?\u201d</p><p>For a few moments I don\u2019t answer. I\u2019m trying to gather all the thoughts I\u2019ve had over the last couple of months. To organize my words into exactly what I want to say.</p><p>\u201cI think...\u201d I say at last, \u201cI think the relationship between a shopper and a client is a very close one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was hoping,\u201d says Luke.</p><p>\u201cThere has to be respect.\u201d I swallow. \u201cThere can\u2019t be canceled appointments. There can\u2019t be sudden business meetings that take priority.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand,\u201d says Luke. \u201cIf you were to take me on, I can assure you that you would always come first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe client has to realize that sometimes the shopper knows best. And... and never just dismiss her opinion. Even when he thinks it\u2019s just gossip, or... or mindless tittle-tattle.\u201d</p><p>I catch a glimpse of Erin\u2019s confused face, and suddenly want to giggle.</p><p>\u201cThe client has already realized that,\u201d says Luke. \u201cThe client is humbly prepared to listen and be put right. On most matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll matters,\u201d I retort at once.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push your luck,\u201d says Luke, his eyes flashing with amusement, and I feel an unwilling grin spread across my face. I catch Erin\u2019s eye and with a sudden blush of comprehension, she hurries out, leaving us alone.</p><p>As the door closes, Luke and I stare at each other. My throat is suddenly tight with emotion.</p><p>\u201cWell, Mr. Brandon...\u201d I say at last. I clear my throat and doodle consideringly on my notepad. \u201cI suppose \u2018most\u2019 would be acceptable. In the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d His eyes are warm and tender. \u201cIs that a yes, Becky? Will you be my... personal shopper?\u201d</p><p>He takes a step forward, and I\u2019m almost touching him. I can smell his familiar scent. Oh God, I\u2019ve missed him.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say happily. \u201cYes, I will.\u201d</p><p>FROM: Gildenstein, Lalla [L.</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */</p><p>TO: Bloomwood, Becky [</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */</p><p>DATE: Wednesday, January 28, 2001, 8:22 a.m.</p><p>SUBJECT: HELP!
