Her hand slipped to the small wooden cross hanging from a bit of leather around her neck, and her thumb rubbed a familiar path over the now smooth surface.</p><p>For several long minutes, she whispered the words she\u2019d recited since she was a child, and then she ended it as she always did. Please, God. Don\u2019t let them find me.</p><p>She pushed herself from the floor, her knees scraping the uneven stones. The plain, brown garb she wore signaled her place along the other novices. Though she\u2019d been here far longer than the others, she\u2019d never taken the vows that would complete her spiritual journey. It was never her intention.</p> <p>She went to the basin in the corner and poured from the pitcher of water. She smiled as she dampened her cloth, and Mother Serenity\u2019s words came floating to mind. Cleanliness is next to Godliness.</p><p>She wiped her face and started to remove her gown to extend her wash when she heard a terrible crash. Startled, she dropped the cloth and whirled around to stare at her closed door. Then galvanized to action, she ran and flung it open, racing into the hall.</p><p>Around her, the other nuns also filled the hall, their dismayed murmurs rising. A loud bellow echoed down the corridor from the abbey\u2019s front entrance. A cry of pain followed the bellow, and Mairin\u2019s heart froze. Mother Serenity.</p><p>Mairin and the rest of the sisters ran toward the sound, some lagging back while others shoved determinedly ahead. When they reached the chapel, Mairin drew up short, paralyzed by the sight before her.</p><p>Warriors were everywhere. There were at least twenty, all dressed in battle gear, their faces unwashed, sweat drenching their hair and clothing. But no blood. They hadn\u2019t come for sanctuary or aid. The leader held Mother Serenity by the arm, and even from a distance, Mairin could see the abbess\u2019s face drawn in pain.</p> <p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d the man demanded in a cold voice.</p><p>Mairin took a step back. He was a fierce-looking man. Evil. Rage coiled in his eyes like a snake waiting to strike. He shook Mother Serenity when she didn\u2019t respond, and she warbled in his grasp like a rag doll.</p><p>Mairin crossed herself and whispered an urgent prayer. The nuns around her gathered in a close ball and also offered their prayers.</p><p>\u201cShe is not here,\u201d Mother Serenity gasped out. \u201cI\u2019ve told you the woman you seek is not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lie!\u201d he roared.</p><p>He looked toward the group of nuns, his gaze flickering coldly over them.</p> <p>\u201cMairin Stuart. Tell me where she is.\u201d</p><p>Mairin went cold, fear rising to a boil in her stomach. How had he found her? After all this time. Her nightmare wasn\u2019t over. It was, indeed, just beginning.</p><p>Her hands shook so badly that she had to hide them in the folds of her dress. Sweat gathered on her brow, and her gut lurched. She swallowed, willing herself not to be sick.</p><p>When no answer was forthcoming, the man smiled, and it sent a chill straight down Mairin\u2019s spine. Still staring at them, he lifted Mother Serenity\u2019s arm so that it was in plain sight. Callously, he bent her index finger until Mairin heard the betraying pop of bone.</p><p>One of the nuns shrieked and ran forward only to be backhanded down by one of the soldiers. The rest of the nuns gasped at the bold outrage.</p><p>\u201cThis is God\u2019s house,\u201d Mother Serenity said in a reedy voice. \u201cYou sin greatly by bringing violence onto holy ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, old woman,\u201d the man snapped. \u201cTell me where Mairin Stuart is or I\u2019ll kill every last one of you.\u201d</p><p>Mairin sucked in her breath and curled her fingers into balls at her sides. She believed him. There was too much evil, too much desperation, in his eyes. He had been sent on a devil\u2019s errand, and he wouldn\u2019t be denied.</p> <p>He grasped Mother Serenity\u2019s middle finger, and Mairin rushed forward.</p><p>\u201cCharity, nay!\u201d Mother Serenity cried.</p><p>Mairin ignored her. \u201cI\u2019m Mairin Stuart. Now let her go!\u201d</p><p>The man dropped Mother Serenity\u2019s hand then shoved the woman back. He stared at Mairin with interest, then let his gaze wander suggestively down her body and back up again. Mairin\u2019s cheeks flamed at the blatant disrespect, but she gave no quarter, staring back at the man with as much defiance as she dared.</p><p>p height=eight=\"0em\" width=\"1em\" align=\"justify\"&gt;He snapped his fingers, and two men advanced on Mairin, grabbing her before she could think to run. They had her on the floor in a split second, their hands fumbling with the hem of her gown.</p><p>She kicked wildly, flailing her arms, but she was no match for their strength. Would they rape her here on the chapel floor? Tears gathered in her eyes as they shoved her clothing up over her hips.</p><p>They turned her to the right and fingers touched her hip, right where the mark rested.</p><p>Oh nay.</p><p>She bowed her head as tears of defeat slipped down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis her!\u201d one of them said excitedly.</p><p>He was instantly shoved aside as the leader bent over to examine the mark for himself.</p><p>He, too, touched it, outlining the royal crest of Alexander. Issuing a grunt of satisfaction, he curled his hand around her chin and yanked until she faced him.</p><p>His smile revolted her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking for you a long time, Mairin Stuart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to hell,\u201d she spat.</p><p>Instead of striking her, his grin broadened. \u201cTsk-tsk, such blasphemy in the house of God.\u201d</p><p>He stood rapidly, and before Mairin could blink, she was hauled over a man\u2019s shoulder, and the soldiers filed out of the abbey and into the cool night.</p><p>They wasted no time getting onto their horses. Mairin was gagged then trussed hand and foot and tossed over the saddle in front of one of the men. They were away, the thunder of hooves echoing across the still night, before she had time to react. They were as precise as they were ruthless.</p><p>The saddle dug into her belly, and she bounced up and down until she was sure she was going to throw up. She moaned, afraid she\u2019d choke with the gag so securely around her mouth.</p><p>When they finally stopped, she was nearly unconscious. A hand gripped her nape, the fingers easily circling the slim column. She was hauled upward and dropped unceremoniously to the ground.</p><p>Around her, they made camp while she lay shivering in the damp air. Finally she heard one say, \u201cYou best be seeing to the lass, Finn. Laird Cameron won\u2019t be happy if she dies of exposure.\u201d</p><p>An irritated grunt followed, but a minute later, she was untied and the gag removed. Finn, the apparent leader of this abduction, leaned down over her, his eyes gleaming in the light of the fire.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one to hear you scream, and if you utter a sound, I\u2019ll rattle your jaw.\u201d</p><p>She nodded her understanding and crawled to an upright position. He nudged her backside with his boot and chuckled when she whirled around in outrage.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a blanket by the fire. Get on it and get some sleep. We leave at first light.\u201d</p><p>She curled gratefully into the warmth of the blanket, uncaring that the stones and sticks on the ground dug into her skin. Laird Cameron. She\u2019d heard talk of him from the soldiers who drifted in and out of the abbey. He was a ruthless man. Greedy and eager to add to his growing power. It was rumored that his army was one of the largest in all of Scotland and that David, the Scottish king, feared him.</p><p>Malcolm, bastard son of Alexander\u2014and her half brother\u2014had already led one revolt against David in a bid for the throne. Were Malcolm and Duncan Cameron to ally, they would be a near unstoppable force.</p><p>She swallowed and closed her eyes. The possession of Neamh \u00c1lainn would render Cameron invincible.</p><p>\u201cDear God, help me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t allow him to gain control of Neamh \u00c1lainn. It was her legacy, the only thing of her father\u2019s that she had.</p><p>It was impossible to sleep, and so she lay there huddled in the blanket, her hand curled around the wooden cross as she prayed for strength and guidance. Some of the soldiers slept while others kept careful watch. She wasn\u2019t fool enough to think she\u2019d be given any opportunity to escape. Not when she was worth more than her weight in gold.</p><p>But they wouldn\u2019t kill her either, which granted her an advantage. She had nothing to fear by trying to escape and everything to gain.</p><p>An hour into her vigil of prayer, a commotion behind her had her sitting straight up and staring into the darkness. Around her, the sleeping soldiers stumbled upward, their hands on their swords when a child\u2019s cry rent the night.</p><p>One of the men hauled a kicking, wiggling child into the circle around the fire and dropped him on the ground. The child crouched and looked around wildly while the men laughed uproariously.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Finn demanded.</p><p>\u201cCaught him trying to sneak one of the horses,\u201d the child\u2019s captor said.</p><p>Anger slanted Finn\u2019s features into those of the devil, made more demonic by the light of the fire. The boy, who couldn\u2019t be more than seven or eight years old, tilted his chin up defiantly as if daring the man to do his worst.</p><p>\u201cWhy you insolent little pup,\u201d Finn roared.</p><p>He raised his hand, and Mairin flew across the ground, throwing herself in front of the child as the fist swung and clipped her cheek.</p><p>She went reeling but recovered and quickly threw herself back over the child, gathering him close so she could cover as much of him as possible.</p><p>The boy struggled wildly under her, screeching obscenities in Gaelic. His head connected with her already aching jaw, and she saw stars.</p><p>\u201cHush now,\u201d she told him in his own language. \u201cBe still. I won\u2019t let them hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet off him!\u201d Finn roared.</p><p>She tightened around the little boy who finally stopped kicking and flailing. Finn reached down and curled his hand into her hair, yanking brutally upward, but she refused to let go of her charge.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to kill me first,\u201d she said cooly when he forced her to look at him.</p><p>He dropped her hair with a curse then reared back and kicked her in the ribs. She hunched over in pain but was careful to keep the child shielded from the maniacal brute.</p><p>\u201cFinn, enough,\u201d one man barked. \u201cThe laird wants her in one piece.\u201d</p><p>Muttering a curse, he backed away. \u201cLet her keep the dirty beggar. She\u2019ll have to turn loose of him soon enough.\u201d</p><p>Mairin snapped her neck up to glare into Finn\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou touch this boy even once and I\u2019ll slit my own throat.\u201d</p><p>Finn\u2019s laughter cracked the night. \u201cThat\u2019s one crazy bluff, lass. If you\u2019re going to try to negotiate, you need to learn to be believable.\u201d</p><p>Slowly she rose until she stood a foot away from the much larger man. She stared up at him until his eyes flickered and he looked away.</p><p>\u201cBluff?\u201d she said softly. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. In fact, if I were you, I\u2019d be guarding any and all sharp objects from me. Think you that I don\u2019t know what my fate is? To be bedded by that brute laird of yours until my belly swells with child and he can claim Neamh \u00c1lainn. I\u2019d rather die.\u201d</p><p>Finn\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re daft!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that might be so, and in that case I\u2019d be worried one of those sharp objects might find its way between your ribs.\u201d</p><p>He waved his hand. \u201cYou keep the boy. The laird will deal with him and you. We don\u2019t take kindly to horse thieves.\u201d</p><p>Mairin ignored him and turned back to the boy who huddled on the ground, staring at her with a mixture of fear and worship.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d she said gently. \u201cIf we snuggle up tight enough, there\u2019s plenty of blanket for the both of us.\u201d</p><p>He went eagerly to her, tucking his smaller body flush against hers.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your home?\u201d she asked when he had settled against her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said mournfully. \u201cIt must be a ways from here. At least two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d she said soothingly. \u201cHow did you come to be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got lost. My papa said I was nevr to leave the keep without his men, but I was tired of being treated like a baby. I\u2019m not, you know.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cAye, I know. So you left the keep?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI took a horse. I only meant to go meet Uncle Alaric. He was due back and I thought to wait near the border to greet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBorder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf our lands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who is your papa, little one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Crispen, not \u2018little one.\u2019 \u201d The distaste was evident in his voice, and she smiled again.</p><p>\u201cCrispen is a fine name. Now continue with your story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMairin,\u201d she answered softly.</p><p>\u201cMy papa is Laird Ewan McCabe.\u201d</p><p>Mairin struggled to place the name, but there were so many clans she had no knowledge of. Her home was in the highlands, but she hadn\u2019t seen God\u2019s country in ten long years.</p><p>\u201cSo you went to meet your uncle. Then what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got lost,\u201d he said mournfully. \u201cThen a McDonald soldier found me and intended to take me to his laird to ransom, but I couldn\u2019t let that happen. It would dishonor my papa, and he can\u2019t afford to ransom me. It would cripple our clan.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mairin stroked his hair as his warm breath blew over her breast. He sounded so much older than his tender years. And so proud.</p><p>\u201cI escaped and hid in the cart of a traveling merchant. I rode for a day before he discovered me.\u201d He tilted his head up, bumping her sore jaw again. \u201cWhere are we, Mairin?\u201d he whispered. \u201cAre we very far from home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure where your home is,\u201d she said ruefully. \u201cBut we are in the lowlands, and I would wager we\u2019re at least a two days\u2019 ride from your keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lowlands,\u201d he spat. \u201cAre you a lowlander?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled at his vehemence. \u201cNay, Crispen. I\u2019m a highlander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you doing here?\u201d he persisted. \u201cDid they steal you from your home?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201c \u2019Tis a long story. One that began before you were born.\u201d</p><p>When he tensed for another question, she hushed him with a gentle squeeze. \u201cGo to sleep now, Crispen. We must keep our strength up if we are to escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to escape?\u201d he whispered.x201Div height=\"0em\"&gt;</p> <p>\u201cAye, of course. That\u2019s what prisoners do,\u201d she said in a cheerful tone. The fear in his voice made her ache for him. How terrifying it must be for him to be so far from home and the ones who love him.</p><p>\u201cWill you take me back home to my papa? I\u2019ll make him protect you from Laird Cameron.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the fierceness in his voice. \u201cOf course, I\u2019ll see to it that you get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind my son!\u201d</p> <p>Ewan McCabe\u2019s roar could be heard over the entire courtyard. His men all stood at attention, their expressions solemn. Some were creased in sympathy. They believed Crispen to be dead, though no one dared to utter that possibility to Ewan.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t something Ewan hadn\u2019t contemplated himself, but he would not rest until his son was found\u2014dead or alive.</p><p>Ewan turned to his brothers, Alaric and Caelen. \u201cI cannot afford to send every man in search of Crispen,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cTo do so would leave us vulnerable. I trust you two with my life\u2014with my son\u2019s life. I want you each to take a contingent of men and ride in different directions. Bring him home to me.\u201d</p><p>Alaric, the second oldest of the McCabe brothers, nodded. \u201cYou know we won\u2019t rest until he is found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I know,\u201d Ewan said.</p><p>Ewan watched as the two strode off, shouting orders to their men. He closed his eyes and curled his fingers into fists of rage. Who dared take his son? For three days he\u2019d waited for a ransom demand, only none had been forthcoming. For three days he\u2019d scoured every inch of McCabe land and beyond.</p><p>Was this a precursor to an attack? Were his enemies plotting to hit him when he was weak? When every available soldier would be involved in the search?</p><p>His jaw hardened as he gazed around his crumbling keep. For eight years he\u2019d struggled to keep his clan alive and strong. The McCabe name had always been synonymous with power and pride. Eight years ago they\u2019d withstood a crippling attack. Betrayed by the woman Caelen loved. Ewan\u2019s father and young wife had been killed, their child surviving only because he\u2019d been hidden by one of the servants.</p> <p>Almost nothing had been left when he and his brothers had returned. Just a hulking mass of ruins, his people scattered to the winds, his army nearly decimated.</p><p>There had been nothing for Ewan to take over when he became laird.</p><p>It had taken this long to rebuild. His soldiers were the best trained in the highlands. He and his brothers worked brutal hours to make sure there was food for the oldting ork, the women, and the children. Many times the men went without. And silently they grew, adding to their numbers until, finally, Ewan had begun to turn their struggling clan around.</p><p>Soon, his thoughts could turn to revenge. Nay, that wasn\u2019t accurate. Revenge had been all that sustained him for these past eight years. There wasn\u2019t a day he hadn\u2019t thought about it.</p><p>\u201cLaird, I bring news of your son.\u201d</p><p>Ewan whipped around to see one of his soldiers hurrying up to him, his tunic dusty as though he\u2019d just gotten off his horse.</p><p>\u201cSpeak,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>\u201cOne of the McDonalds came upon your son three days ago along the northern border of your land. He took him, intending to deliver him to their laird so he could ransom the boy. Only, the boy escaped. No one has seen him since.\u201d</p><p>Ewan trembled with rage. \u201cTake eight soldiers and ride to McDonald. Deliver him this message. He will present the soldier who took my son to the entrance of my keep or he signs his own death warrant. If he doesn\u2019t comply, I will come for him myself. I will kill him. And it won\u2019t be quick. Do not leave a word out of my message.\u201d</p><p>The soldier bowed. \u201cAye, Laird.\u201d</p><p>He turned and hurried off, leaving Ewan with a mix of relief and rage. Crispen was alive, or at least he had been. McDonald was a fool for breaching their tacit peace agreement. Though the two clans could hardly be considered allies, McDonald wasn\u2019t stupid enough to incite the wrath of Ewan McCabe. His keep might be crumbling, and his people might not be the best-fed clan, but his might had been restored twofold.</p><p>His soldiers were a deadly fighting force to be reckoned with, and those close enough to Ewan\u2019s holdings realized it. But Ewan\u2019s sights weren\u2019t on his neighbors. They were on Duncan Cameron. Ewan wouldn\u2019t be happy until the whole of Scotland dripped with Cameron\u2019s blood.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>Mairin gazed wearily at the looming keep as they rode through the final stone skirt and into the courtyard. Thoughts of escape deteriorated as she stared helplessly at the massive holding. It was impenetrable.</p><p>Men were everywhere, most of them training, some tending to repairs on portions of the inner wall, others taking a rest and drinking water from a pail close to the steps of the keep.</p><p>As if sensing her fatalistic thoughts, Crispen looked up, his green eyes bright with fear. Her arms were looped around his body, her hands tied together in front of him, and she squeezed him to try to reassure him. But \u2019twas God\u2019s truth, she was shaking like the last leaf in autumn.</p><p>The soldier leading her horse pulled up, and she had to fight to stay in the saddle. Crispen steadied them by grabbing onto the horse\u2019s mane.</p><p>Finn rode up beside them and yanked Mairin from the horse. Crispen came with her, screeching his surprise as he tumbled from her grasp to the ground.</p><p>Finn lowered her down, his fingers bruising her arm with his grip. She wrenched away and reached with her bound hands to help Crispen stand.</p><p>All around them, activity ceased as everyone stopped to take stock of the new arrival. A few of the keep\u2019s women stared curiously at her from a distance, whispering behind their hands.</p><p>She knew she must look a fright, but she was more concerned with what would happen when Laird Cameron arrived to view his captive. God help her then.</p><p>And then she saw him. He appeared at the top of the steps leading into the keep, his gaze sharp as he sought her out. The rumors of his greed, of his ruthlessness and ambition, led her to expect the very image of the devil. To her surprise, he was an exceedingly handsome man.</p><p>His clothing was immaculate, as though it had never seen a day on the battlefield. She knew better. She\u2019d mended too many soldiers who\u2019d crossed paths with him. Soft leather trews and a dark green tunic with boots that looked too new. At his side, his sword gleamed in the sunlight, the blade honed to a deadly sharpness.</p><p>Her hands automatically went to her throat, and she swallowed rapidly against the knot forming.</p><p>\u201cYou found her?\u201d Duncan Cameron called from the top of the steps.</p><p>\u201cAye, Laird.\u201d Finn thrust her forward, shaking her like a rag doll. \u201cThis be Mairin Stuart.\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s eyes narrowed, and he frowned as though he\u2019d suffered disappointment in the past. Had he been looking for her for so long? She shivered and tried not to allow her fear to overwhelm her.</p><p>\u201cShow me,\u201d Duncan barked.</p><p>Crispen moved toward her just as Finn hauled her against him. She slammed into his chest with enough force to knock the breath from her. Another soldier appeared at his side, and to her utter humiliation, they tossed up the hem of her dress.</p><p>Duncan descended the steps, his face creased in concentration as he neared. Something feral sparked in his eyes, and they lighted in triumph.</p><p>His finger caressed the outline of the brand, and he broke into a broad grin. \u201cThe royal crest of Alexander,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAll this time you were thought dead, Neamh \u00c1lainn lost forever. Now you are both mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d she gritted out.</p><p>He looked startled for a moment and then he stepped back, scowling at Finn. \u201cCover her.\u201d</p><p>Finn yanked down her clothing and released her arm. Crispen was back at her side immediately.</p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d Duncan thundered when he laid eyes on Crispen. \u201cIs this her brat? Does she claim him? It cannot be!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, Laird,\u201d Finn was quick to say. \u201cThe child is not hers. We caught him trying to steal one of our horses. She champions him. Nothing else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet rid of him.\u201d</p><p>Mairin wrapped both arms around Crispen and stared at Duncan with all the force of her hatred. \u201cYou touch him and you\u2019ll regret the day you were born.\u201d</p><p>Duncan blinked in surprise and then rage suffused his face, flushing it to near purple. \u201cYou dare, you dare to threaten me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, kill me,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cThat would serve your purpose well.\u201d</p><p>He lashed out and backhanded her across the cheek. She fell to the ground, her hand snapping up to cup her jaw.</p><p>\u201cLeave her alone!\u201d Crispen cried.</p><p>She lunged for him, pulling him down until he was cradled in her arms. \u201cShhh,\u201d she cautioned. \u201cDo nothing to anger him further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you have regained your senses,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cSee to it they don\u2019t leave you again.\u201d</p><p>She said nothing, just lay there on the ground, holding Crispen as she stared at Duncan\u2019s unmarred boots. He must never work, she thought. Even his hand was soft against her cheek. How could a man who rose to power on the broken backs of others have such strength?</p><p>\u201cTake her inside and give her to the women to bathe,\u201d Duncan said in disgust.</p><p>\u201cStay near me,\u201d she whispered to Crispen. She didn\u2019t trust Finn not to hurt him.</p><p>Finn hauled her to her feet and half dragged, half carried her inside the keep. Though the outside gleamed, the inside was dirty and musty and smelled of days-old ale. Dogs barked excitedly, and she curled her nose as the odor of feces assaulted her nostrils.</p><p>\u201cUpstairs with you,\u201d Finn snarled, as he shoved her toward the stairs. \u201cAnd don\u2019t be trying anything. I\u2019ll have guards posted outside your door. Make it quick. You don\u2019t want to keep the laird waiting.\u201d</p><p>The two women given the task of seeing to Mairin\u2019s bath viewed her with a mixture of sympathy and curiosity as they briskly washed her hair.</p><p>\u201cDo you be wanting the lad to bathe as well?\u201d one asked.</p><p>\u201cNay!\u201d Crispen exclaimed from his perch on the bed.</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d Mairin echoed softly. \u201cLeave him be.\u201d</p><p>After they rinsed the soap from Mairin\u2019s hair, they helped her from the tub and soon had her dressed in a beautiful blue gown with elaborate embroidery around the neck and sleeves and again at the hem. She didn\u2019t miss the significance of being dressed in Duncan\u2019s colors. How easily heconsidered her his conquest.</p><p>When the two women offered to arrange her hair, Mairin shook her head. As soon as it was dry she\u2019d braid it.</p><p>With a shrug, the women departed the room, leaving her to await her summons from Duncan.</p><p>She sat down on the bed next to Crispen, and he snuggled into the crook of her arm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting you dirty,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do, Mairin?\u201d</p><p>His voice shook with fear, and she kissed the top of his head.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll think of something, Crispen. We\u2019ll think of something.\u201d</p><p>The door flew open, and Mairin instinctively shoved Crispen behind her. Finn stood there in the doorway, his gaze triumphant.</p><p>\u201cThe laird wants you.\u201d</p><p>She turned to Crispen and cupped his chin until he looked directly into her eyes. \u201cStay here,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t come out of this room. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his eyes wide with fright.</p><p>She rose and went to where Finn stood. When he reached for her arm, she yanked it away. \u201cI\u2019m capable of walking unaided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUppity bitch,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>She preceded him down the stairs, her dread growing with each passing second. When she saw the priest standing next to the fire in the great hall, she knew that Duncan was taking no chances. He\u2019d marry her, bed her, and seal her fate and that of Neamh \u00c1lainn.</p><p>As Finn shoved her forward, she prayed for strength and courage for what she must do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s my bride now,\u201d Duncan said, as he turned from his conversation with the priest.</p><p>His smile didn\u2019t reach his eyes, and he studied her intently, almost as if he were warning her of the consequences if she refused.</p><p>God, help me.</p><p>The priest cleared his throat and focused his attention on Mairin. \u201cAre you willing, lass?\u201d</p> <p>Silence fell as all awaited her response. Then slowly, she shook her head. The priest swung his gaze to Duncan, a look of accusation in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this, Laird? You told me you both wished this marriage.\u201d</p><p>The look on Duncan\u2019s face had the priest backtracking. The priest hastily crossed himself and positioned himself a safe distance from Duncan.</p><p>Then Duncan turned to her, and her blood ran cd. For such a handsome man, he was, in that moment, very ugly.</p><p>He stepped toward her, grasping her arm above the elbow, squeezing until she feared her bone would snap.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask this only once more,\u201d he said in a deceptively soft voice. \u201cAre you willing?\u201d</p><p>She knew. She knew that when she uttered her denial, he would retaliate. He might even kill her if he saw his path to Neamh \u00c1lainn shattered. But she hadn\u2019t stayed sequestered all these years only to yield at the first sign of adversity. Somehow, someway, she must find a way out of this mess.</p><p>She lifted her shoulders, infusing the steel of a broadsword into her spine. In a clear, distinct voice, she uttered her denial. \u201cNay.\u201d</p><p>His roar of rage nearly shattered her ears. His fist sent her flying several feet, and she huddled into a ball, gasping for breath. He\u2019d hit her so hard in the ribs that she couldn\u2019t squeeze breath into her lungs.</p><p>She raised her shocked and unfocused gaze up to see him towering over her, his anger a tangible, terrible thing. In that moment, she knew she\u2019d chosen right. Even if he killed her in his frenzy, what would her life be like as his wife? After she bore him the necessary heir to Neamh \u00c1lainn, he\u2019d have no further use for her anyway, and he\u2019d just rid himself of her then.</p><p>\u201cYield,\u201d he demanded, his fist raised in warning.</p> <p>\u201cNay.\u201d</p><p>Her voice didn\u2019t come out as strong as before. It came out more of a breathy exhalation than anything, and her lips trembled. But she made herself heard.</p><p>In the great hall, the murmurs rose, and Duncan\u2019s face swelled, his cheeks purpling until she thought he might well explode.</p><p>That shiny boot kicked out, connecting with her body. Her cry of pain was muted by the next blow. Over and over, he kicked, and then he yanked her up and drove his fist into her side.</p><p>\u201cLaird, you\u2019ll kill her!\u201d</p><p>She was barely conscious. She had no idea who uttered the warning. She hung in his grasp, every breath causing her unbearable pain.</p><p>Duncan dropped her in disgust. \u201cLock her in her chambers. No one is to give her any food or water. Nor that brat of hers. We\u2019ll see how soon it takes her to yield when he starts whining of hunger.\u201d</p><p>Again, she was hauled upward with no regard to her injuries. Each step up the stairs was agony as she bounced against the hard stone. The door to her chamber opened, and Finn threw her inside.</p> <p>She hit the floor, battling for consciousness with every breath.</p><p>\u201cMairin!\u201d</p><p>Crispen huddled over her, his little hands gripping her painfully.</p><p>\u201cNay, don\u2019t touch m\u201d she whispered hoarsely. If he touched her, she was sure she\u2019d faint.</p><p>\u201cYou must get to the bed,\u201d he said desperately. \u201cI\u2019ll help you. Please, Mairin.\u201d</p><p>He was near tears, and it was only the thought of how he\u2019d survive in Duncan\u2019s hands if she died that prevented her from closing her eyes and praying for peace.</p><p>She roused herself enough to crawl toward the bed, each movement sending a scream down her spine. Crispen bore as much of her weight as he could, and together they managed to haul her over the edge of the bed.</p><p>She melted into the straw mattress, hot tears slipping down her cheeks. Breathing hurt. Crispen settled next to her, his warm, sweet body seeking comfort she couldn\u2019t offer.</p><p>Instead, his arms went around her, and he hugged her to his little body. \u201cPlease don\u2019t die, Mairin,\u201d he begged softly. \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady. My lady, wake up. You must wake up.\u201d</p><p>The urgent whisper roused Mairin from unconsciousness, and as soon as she turned, seeking the annoyance that disturbed her, agony flashed through her body until she gasped for breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the woman said anxiously. \u201cI know you\u2019re badly injured, but you must hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry?\u201d</p><p>Mairin\u2019s voice was slurred, and her brain was a mass of cobwebs. Beside her, Crispen stirred and gave a start of fright when he saw the shadow standing over the bed.</p><p>\u201cAye, hurry,\u201d the impatient voice came again.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Mairin managed to ask.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t time to talk, Lady. The laird is in a drunken sleep. He\u2019ll think you too badly hurt to escape. We have to go now if you are to make it. He plans to kill the child if you don\u2019t yield.\u201d</p><p>At the word escape, some of the cobwebs vanished. She tried to sit up but nearly cried out when pain knifed through her side.</p><p>\u201cHere, let me help you. You too, lad,\u201d the woman said to Crispen. \u201cHelp me with your lady.\u201d</p><p>Crispen scrambled over the bed and slid off the edge.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d Mairin asked when they both helped her sit up.</p><p>\u201cWhat he did was a disgrace,\u201d the woman murmured. \u201cTo beat a lass as he did you. He\u2019s mad. You\u2019ve been his obsession. I fear for your life no matter whether you yield or not. He\u2019ll kill the boy.\u201d</p><p>Mairin squeezed her hand with the little strength she had. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must hurry. There is a bolt-hole in the next chaber. You\u2019ll have to leave alone. I can\u2019t risk taking you. At the end, Fergus waits for you with a horse. He\u2019ll put you and the lad on it. It\u2019ll pain you, aye, but you\u2019ll have to endure. \u2019Tis your only way out.\u201d</p><p>Mairin nodded her acceptance. Escape in agony or die in comfort. Didn\u2019t seem like such a difficult decision.</p><p>The serving woman cracked open the door of the chamber, turned back to Mairin, and put a finger to her lips. She motioned to the left to let Mairin know the guard was there.</p><p>Crispen slid his hand into hers, and again she squeezed to comfort him. Inch by breathless inch, they crept by the sleeping guard in the darkness of the hall. Mairin held her breath the entire way, afraid if she let out so much as a puff, the guard would wake and alert the keep.</p><p>Finally they reached the next chamber. Dust flew and curled around her nose as they stepped within, and she had to squeeze her nostrils to keep from sneezing.</p><p>\u201cOver here,\u201d the woman whispered in the darkness.</p><p>Mairin followed the sound of her voice until she felt the chill emanating from the stone wall.</p><p>\u201cGod be with you,\u201d the serving woman said as she ushered Mairin and Crispen into the small tunnel.</p><p>Mairin stopped only long enough to squeeze her hand in a quick thank-you, and then she urged Crispen into the narrow passageway.</p><p>Each step sent a fresh wave of agony through Mairin. She feared her ribs were broken, but there was naught that could be done about it now.</p><p>They hurried through the darkness, Mairin all but dragging Crispen behind her.</p><p>\u201cWho goes there?\u201d</p><p>Mairin halted at the man\u2019s voice but remembered that the woman had said Fergus awaited them.</p><p>\u201cFergus?\u201d she called softly. \u201c \u2019Tis I, Mairin Stuart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome, Lady,\u201d he urged.</p><p>She rushed to the end and stepped onto the cold, damp ground, wincing when her bare feet made contact with rough pebbles. She gazed at their surroundings and saw that the bolt-hole exited the back of the keep where there was only a skirt between the keep and the hillside that jutted skyward.</p><p>Wordlessly, Fergus melted into the darkness, and Mairin ran to catch up to him. They moved along the bottom of the hillside and headed for the dense population of trees at the perimeter of Duncan\u2019s holding.</p><p>A horse was tied to one of the trees, and Fergus quickly freed him, gathering the reins as he turned to Mairin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll lift you up first and then the lad.\u201d He pointed into the distance. \u201cThat way is north. God be with you.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, he lifted her, all but tossing her into the saddle. If the s all she could do not to fall off. Tears crushed her eyes and she doubled over, fighting unconsciousness.</p><p>Help me please, God.</p><p>Fergus lifted Crispen, who settled in front of her. She was glad he wasn\u2019t riding behind her because, God\u2019s truth, she needed something to hang on to.</p><p>\u201cCan you manage the reins?\u201d she whispered to Crispen as she leaned into him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll protect you,\u201d Crispen said fiercely. \u201cHold on to me, Mairin. I\u2019ll take us home, I swear it.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the determination in his voice. \u201cI know you will.\u201d</p><p>Fergus gave the horse a slap, and it started forward. Mairin bit her lip against the scream of pain that battled to erupt. She would never make it even a mile.</p><p>Alaric McCabe drew up his horse and held his fist up to halt his men. They\u2019d ridden all morning, searching endless trails, tracking hoofprints to no avail. All were dead ends. He slid from the saddle and strode forward to view the disturbance in the soil. Kneeling, he touched the faint hoofprints and the flattened grass to the side. It looked as though someone took a fall from a horse. Recently.</p><p>He scanned the immediate area and saw a footprint in a patch of bare soil a few feet away, then lifted his gaze toward the area the person had headed. Slowly he rose, drew his sword, and motioned for his men to spread out and circle the area.</p><p>Carefully, he stepped through the trees, watching warily for any sign of ambush. He saw the horse first, grazing a short distance away, the reins hanging, the saddle askew. He frowned. Such disregard for the care of a horse was surely a sin.</p><p>A slight rustle to his right swung him around, and he found himself staring at a small woman, her back wedged against a huge tree. Her skirts jumped like she had a litter of kittens hidden underneath, and her wide blue eyes were full of fear\u2014and fury.</p><p>Her long black hair hung in disarray to her waist, and it was then he noticed the colors of her tunic and the coat of arms embroidered at the hem.</p><p>Rage temporarily blinded him, and he advanced, his sword held in an arc over his head.</p><p>She flung an arm behind her, shoving something farther between her and the tree. Her skirts wriggled again, and it was then he realized she shielded a person. A child.</p><p>\u201cStay behind me,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>\u201cBut Mair\u2014\u201d</p><p>Alaric froze. He knew that voice. His fingers shook, for the first time in his life his hand unsteady around the hilt. Hell would be a cold place indeed before he ever allowed a Cameron hand on his kin.</p><p>With a snarl of rage, he charged forward, grasped the woman by the shoulder, and hurled her aside. Crispen stood against the tree, his mouth open. Then he saw Alaric and all but leapt into his arms.</p><p>The sword fell to the ground\u2014another sin of neglect\u2014but in that moment Alaric didn\u2019t care. Sweet relief staggered him.</p><p>\u201cCrispen,\u201d he said hoarsely, as he hugged the boy to him.</p><p>A shriek of rage assaulted his ears just as he was hit by a flying bundle of woman. So surprised was he, that he stumbled backward, his hold on Crispen loosening.</p><p>She wedged herself between him and Crispen and landed a knee to his groin. He doubled over, cursing as agony washed over him. He fell to one knee and grabbed his sword just as he whistled for his men. The woman was demented.</p><p>Through the haze of pain, he saw her grab a resisting Crispen and try to run. Several things happened at once. Two of his men stepped in front of her. She halted, causing Crispen to slam into her back. When she started in the opposite direction, Gannon raised his arm to stop her.</p><p>To Alaric\u2019s astonishment, she swiveled, grabbed Crispen, and fell to the ground, her body huddled protectively over him.</p><p>Gannon and Cormac froze and looked to Alaric just as the rest of his men burst through the trees.</p><p>To further confuse the hell out of all of them, Crispen finally wiggled out from underneath her and threw himself on top of her, scowling ferociously the entire time at Gannon.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you hit her!\u201d he bellowed.</p><p>Every one of his men blinked in surprise at Crispen\u2019s ferocity.</p><p>\u201cLad, I wasn\u2019t going to hit the lass,\u201d Gannon said. \u201cI was trying to prevent her from fleeing. With you. God\u2019s teeth, we\u2019ve been searching for you for days. The laird is worried sick over you.\u201d</p><p>Alaric strode over to Crispen and plucked him off the huddled woman. When he reached down to haul her upright, Crispen exploded again, shoving him back.</p><p>Alaric stared at his nephew with an open mouth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch her,\u201d Crispen said. \u201cShe\u2019s badly hurt, Uncle Alaric.\u201d</p><p>Crispen chewed his bottom lip, and it looked for the world like the lad was going to break down and cry. Whoever the woman was, it was obvious Crispen didn\u2019t fear her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt her, lad,\u201d Alaric said softly.</p><p>He knelt down and brushed aside the hair from her face and realized she was unconscious. There was a bruise on one cheek, but otherwise she didn\u2019t look injured.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she hurt?\u201d he asked Crispen.</p><p>Tears filled Crispen\u2019s eyes, and he wiped hastily at them with the back of his grubby hand.</p> <p>\u201cHer stomach. And her back. It hurts her fierce if anyone touches her.\u201d</p><p>Carefully, so as no to alarm the boy, Alaric pulled at her clothing. When her abdomen and back came into view, he sucked in his breath. Around him, his men alternately cursed and murmured their pity for the slight lass.</p><p>\u201cGod in heaven, what happened to her?\u201d Alaric asked.</p><p>Her entire rib cage was purple, and ugly bruises marred her smooth back. He could swear one of them was in the shape of a man\u2019s boot.</p><p>\u201cHe beat her,\u201d Crispen choked out. \u201cTake us home, Uncle Alaric. I want my papa.\u201d</p> <p>Not wanting the boy to lose his composure in front of the other men, Alaric nodded and patted him on the arm. There would be plenty of time to get the story from Crispen later. Ewan would want to hear it all.</p><p>He stared down at the unconscious woman and frowned. She had offered her body for Crispen\u2019s, and yet she wore the colors of Duncan Cameron. Ewan would be beyond control if Cameron had any involvement in Crispen\u2019s disappearance.</p><p>War. At long last, war would be declared.</p><p>He motioned for Cormac to tend to the lass, and he reached for Crispen, intending that the boy ride with him. There were several questions he wanted answered on the ride home.</p><p>Crispen shook his head adamantly. \u201cNay, you take her, Uncle Alaric. She has to ride with you. I promised her that Papa would keep her safe, but he\u2019s not here so you have to do it. You have to.\u201d</p><p>Alaric sighed. There was no reasoning with the boy, and right now he was so glad he was alive, he\u2019d cede to his ridiculous demands. Later he\u2019d bend the brat\u2019s ear about not questioning authority.</p> <p>\u201cI want to ride with you, too,\u201d Crispen said, his gaze nervously going to the woman.</p><p>He inched closer to her as if he couldn\u2019t stand the idea of being separated from her.</p><p>Alaric looked skyward. Ewan hadn\u2019t taken a firm enough hand with the boy. That was all there was to it.</p><p>And so Alaric found himself astride his horse with the woman draped across the saddle in front of him, her body shielded in the crook of one arm, while Crispen sat on his other leg, his head nestled against her bosom.</p><p>He glared at his men, daring even one of them to laugh. Hell, he had to relinquish his sword for the duty of carrying the two extra persons, never mind their weight didn\u2019t equal that of a single warrior.</p><p>Ewan just better be damn grateful. He could decide what was to be done with the woman just as soon as Alaric dumped her into Ewan\u2019s lap.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>As soon as they crossed over the border onto McCabe land, a shout went up that echoed through the hills, and in the distance, Mairin heard the cry taken up and relayed. Soon, the laird would know of his son\u2019s return.</p> <p>She twisted the reins nervously in her fingers as Crispen all but bounced off the saddle in his excitement.</p><p>\u201cIf you keep gathering those reins, lass, you and the horse are going to end up back where you came from.\u201d</p><p>She glanced guiltily up at Alaric McCabe, who rode to her right. His admonishment had come out as a tease, but God\u2019s truth, the man scared her. He looked savage with his unkempt, long dark hair and the braids dangling on each side of his temples.</p><p>When she\u2019d awakened in his arms, she\u2019d nearly tossed them both out of the saddle in her haste to escape. He\u2019d been forced to pry both her and Crispen from their perch against him, and he\u2019d put them both on the ground until the entire thing could be sorted out.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been pleased by her stubbornness, but she had Crispen solidly on her side, and having extracted a promise from Crispen to tell no one her name, they\u2019d both stood mute when Alaric demanded answers.</p><p>Oh, he\u2019d blustered and waved his arms. Even threatened to choke the both of them, and in the end he\u2019d muttered blasphemies against women and children before resuming their journey to bring Crispen home.</p><p>Alaric had then insisted she ride with him at least another day, because he said, in no uncertain terms, the likelihood of her sitting a horse by herself in her condition was nil, and it was a sin to abuse a good horse with an inept mount.</p><p>The journey that would normally last two days took them three, thanks to Alaric\u2019s consideration of her condition and their stopping frequently to rest. She knew Alaric was considerate because he told her. Numerous times.</p><p>After the first day, she was determined to ride without Alaric\u2019s assistance, if for no other reason than to wipe the smugness from his expression. He obviously had no patience for women, and, she suspected, with the exception of his nephew, whom he obviously loved, he had even less patience with children.</p><p>Still, given the fact that he knew nothing about her, only that Crispen championed her, he had treated her well, and his men had been politely respectful.</p><p>Now that they neared Laird McCabe\u2019s stronghold, fear fluttered in her throat. She would no longer be able to keep silent. The laird would demand answers, and she would be obligated to give them.</p><p>She leaned down to whisper close to Crispen\u2019s ear. \u201cDo you remember your promise to me, Crispen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he whispered back. \u201cI\u2019m not to tell anyone your name.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, feeling guilty for asking such a thing from the boy, but if she could pretend to be of no importance, just someone who happened upon Crispen and saw him safely back to his father, perhaps he would be grateful enough to provide a horse and maybe some food, and she could be on her way.</p><p>\u201cNot even your father,\u021d she pressed.</p><p>Crispen nodded solemnly. \u201cI\u2019ll only tell him you saved me.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his arm with her free hand. \u201cThank you. I could ask for no better champion.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head back to grin broadly at her, his back puffing with pride.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the two of you whispering about?\u201d Alaric demanded irritably.</p><p>She glanced over to see the warrior watching her, his eyes narrow with suspicion.</p><p>\u201cIf I wanted you to know, I\u2019d have spoken louder,\u201d she said calmly.</p><p>He turned away muttering what she was sure were more blasphemies about annoying females.</p><p>\u201cYou must make the priest weary with the length of your confessions,\u201d she said.</p><p>He raised one eyebrow. \u201cWho says I confess anything?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. The arrogant man probably thought his path to heaven was already assured, and that he acted in accordance to God\u2019s will just by breathing.</p><p>\u201cLook, there it is!\u201d Crispen shouted as he pointed eagerly ahead.</p><p>They topped the hill and looked down at the stone keep nestled into the side of the next hill.</p><p>The skirt was crumbled in several places, and there was a detail of men working steadily, replacing the stones at the wall. What she could see of the keep above the outer walls looked blackened by an old fire.</p><p>The loch spread out to the right of the keep, the water glistening in the sunlight. One of the fingers meandered around the front of the keep, providing a natural barrier to the front gate. The bridge across it, however, sagged precariously in the middle. A temporary, narrow path over the water had been fashioned to the side, and it would only allow one horse at a time into the keep.</p><p>Despite the obvious state of disrepair to the keep, the land was beautiful. Scattered across the valley to the left of the keep, sheep grazed, herded by an older man flanked by two dogs. Occasionally one of the dogs raced out to herd the sheep back into the imaginary boundary, and then he\u2019d return to his master to receive an approving pat on the head.</p><p>She turned to Alaric, who\u2019d pulled to a stop beside her. \u201cWhat happened here?\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t answer. A deep scowl creased his face, and his eyes went nearly black. She gripped the reins a little tighter and shivered under the intensity of his hatred. Aye, hatred. There could be no other term for what she saw in his eyes.</p><p>Alaric spurred his horse, and hers followed automatically, leaving her to grab onto Crispen to make sure neither of them fell.</p><p>Down the hill they rode, Alaric\u2019s men flanking her protectively on all sides. Crispen fidgeted so hard in the saddle that she had to grip hisarm so he wouldn\u2019t jump out of his skin.</p><p>When they reached the temporary crossing, Alaric halted to wait on her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go in first. You follow directly behind me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded her understanding. It wasn\u2019t as if she wanted to be the first into the keep anyway. In some ways, this was more frightening to her than arriving at Duncan Cameron\u2019s keep because she didn\u2019t know her fate here. She certainly knew what Cameron had in mind for her.</p><p>They rode over the bridge and through the wide, arched entryway into the courtyard. A great shout went up, and it took her a moment to realize that it was Alaric who\u2019d made the sound. She looked over to see him still astride his horse, his fist held high in the air.</p><p>All around her, soldiers\u2014and there were hundreds\u2014thrust their swords skyward and took up the cry, raising and lowering their blades in celebration.</p><p>A man entered the courtyard at a dead run, his hair flying behind him as his stride ate up the ground below him.</p><p>\u201cPapa!\u201d Crispen cried, and scrambled out of the saddle before she could prevent him.</p><p>He hit the ground running, and Mairin stared in fascination at the man she assumed was Crispen\u2019s father. Her stomach knotted, and she swallowed, trying not to allow herself to panic all over again.</p><p>The man was huge, and just as mean looking as Alaric, and she didn\u2019t know how she could think it, when there was so much joy on his face as he swung Crispen into his arms, but he frightened her in a way that Alaric did not.</p><p>The brothers were very similar in build and stature. Both had dark hair that fell below their shoulders, and both wore braids. As she looked around, though, it became apparent that all his men wore their hair the same way. Long, wild, and savage looking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you, lad,\u201d his father choked out.</p><p>Crispen clung to the laird with his small arms, reminding Mairin of a burr stubbornly clinging to her skirts.</p><p>Over Crispen\u2019s head, his gaze met Mairin\u2019s, and his eyes immediately hardened. He took in every detail about her, she was sure, and she twisted uncomfortably, feeling horribly picked apart under his scrutiny.</p><p>She started to get down from her horse because she felt a little silly when everyone around her was dismounting, but Alaric was there, his hands reaching up to effortlessly pluck her from the horse and set her down on the ground.</p><p>\u201cEasy, lass,\u201d he cautioned. \u201cYou\u2019re healing well, but you need to take care.\u201d</p><p>He sounded almost concerned, but when she looked up at him, he wore the same scowl he always wore when he looked at her. Irritated, she scowled right back. He blinked in surprise, then pushed her toward the waiting laird.</p><p>Ewan McCabe looked a lot more threatening now that Crispen was out of his arms and back on the ground. She found herself backing up a step only to collide with the mountain that was Alaric.</p><p>Ewan looked first at Alaric, bypassing her as if she were invisible, which was just fine with her.</p><p>\u201cYou have my thanks for bringing my son home. I had every confidence in you and Caelen.\u201d</p><p>Alaric cleared his throat and nudged Mairin forward.</p><p>\u201cYou have the lass to thank for Crispen\u2019s return. I merely provided the escort.\u201d</p><p>Ewan\u2019s eyes narrowed as he studied her further. To her astonishment, his eyes weren\u2019t the dark, fierce orbs she\u2019d thought, but rather they were an odd pale green. When he scowled, though, his face darkened to a thundercloud, and who could possibly think his eyes were anything but a matching black?</p><p>Startled by this revelation\u2014and if she were avoiding the inevitable confrontation with the laird, who could blame her?\u2014she turned abruptly and stared up into Alaric\u2019s eyes. He blinked then glared at her like he thought she was daft\u2014and she was pretty sure he did think so.</p><p>\u201cYour eyes are green, too,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Alaric\u2019s scowl turned into a look of concern. \u201cAre you sure you didn\u2019t suffer a blow to the head you didn\u2019t tell me about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will look at me,\u201d Ewan roared.</p><p>She jumped and whirled around, taking an instinctive step back and landing once again against Alaric.</p><p>He muttered an expletive and hunched over, but she was too worried about Ewan to see what Alaric was cursing over.</p><p>Her courage had run out, and her determination not to feel pain, not to allow her spine to wither, promptly died a brutal death.</p><p>Her legs shook, her hands shook, and pain speared through her sides, making her gasp softly with each breath. Sweat beaded her forehead, but she wouldn\u2019t allow herself to back down any further.</p><p>The laird was angry\u2014at her\u2014and for the life of her she couldn\u2019t discern why. Shouldn\u2019t he be grateful to her for saving his son? Not that she\u2019d really done anything heroic, but he didn\u2019t know that. For all he knew, she could have battled ten men on Crispen\u2019s behalf. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It wasn\u2019t until he stared back at her in astonishment that she realized she\u2019d babbled her entire thought process aloud. The entire courtyard had gone silent and looked at her as if she\u2019d pronounced a curse on all of them.</p><p>\u201cAlaric?\u201d she murmured, not turning away from the laird\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cAye, lass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you catch me if I faint? I don\u2019t think a fall to the ground would be good for my injuries.\u201d</p> <p>To her surprise, he grasped both of her shoulders and held her tightly. His hands trembled the slightest amount, and he made the weirdest sound. Was he laughing at her?</p><p>Ewan advanced, his astonishment replaced by that dark scowl again. Did no one in the McCabe clan ever smile?</p><p>\u201cNay, we don\u2019t,\u201d Alaric said in amusement.</p><p>She snapped her lips shut, determined she wouldn\u2019t say another word, and prepared herself for the laird\u2019s censure.</p><p>Ewan stopped a single foot in front of her, forcing her to crane her neck upward to meet his stare. It was hard to be brave when she was sandwiched between two hulking warriors, but her pride wouldn\u2019t allow her to throw herself at his feet and beg for mercy. Even if she currently thought it was the best idea. Nay, she\u2019d faced down Duncan Cameron and survived. This warrior was bigger and meaner, and he could probably squash her like a bug, but she wouldn\u2019t die like a coward. She wouldn\u2019t die at all if she had anything to say about it.</p> <p>\u201cYou will tell me who you are, why you\u2019re wearing Duncan Cameron\u2019s colors, and how the hell my son came into your possession.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, backed up against Alaric, only to hear him curse again as she stepped all over his feet, and then quickly stepped forward again, remembering, belatedly, her vow to be courageous.</p><p>Ewan frowned even harder, if that was possible. \u201cYou defy me?\u201d</p><p>There was a note of incredulity in his voice that she might find amusing if she weren\u2019t bathed in pain and about to shake right out of the gown that offended the laird so.</p><p>Her stomach boiled, and she prayed she wouldn\u2019t throw up on his boots. They weren\u2019t new and shiny like Duncan\u2019s, but somehow she thought he\u2019d take great offense anyway.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t defy you, Laird,\u201d she said in an even voice that made her proud.</p> <p>\u201cThen give me the information I seek. And do it now,\u201d he added in a deadly soft voice.</p><p>\u201cI ...\u201d</p><p>Her voice cracked like ice, and she swallowed back the nausea that rose in her throat.</p><p>She was saved by Crispen, who could obviously stand still no longer. He burst forward, inserting himself between her and his father, and wrapped his arms around her legs, burying his face in her bruised abdomen.</p><p>A low moan escaped her, and she reflexively put her arms around Crispen to pull him away from her ribs. She would have slithered straight to the ground if not for Alaric grasping her arms to steady her again.</p><p>Crispen turned in her grasp and stared up at his father who looked to be battling extreme shock and burning impatience.</p><p>\u201cLeave her alone!\u201d Crispen exclaimed. \u201cShe\u2019s hurt, and I promised you\u2019d protect her, Papa. I promised. A McCabe never breaks his word. You told me.\u201d</p><p>Ewan looked down at his son in astonishment, his mouth working up and down as the veins in his neck bulged.</p> <p>\u201cThe lad is right, Ewan. The lass is sorely in need of a bed. A hot bath wouldn\u2019t be remiss.\u201d</p><p>Surprised by Alaric\u2019s support, but more grateful than she could possibly express, she chanced another look at the laird only to see him gape incredulously at Alaric.</p><p>\u201cBed? Bath? My son has been returned to me by a woman wearing the colors of a man I loathe more than life, and all anyone can suggest is that I give her a bath and a bed?\u201d</p><p>The laird looked precariously close to exploding. She stepped back, and this time, Alaric accommodated her by moving aside so she could put distance between her and Ewan.</p><p>\u201cShe did save his life,\u201d Alaric said evenly.</p><p>\u201cShe took a beating for me,\u201d Crispen shouted.</p><p>Ewan\u2019s expression wavered, and he stared again at her as if trying to see for himself the extent of her injuries. He looked torn, as if he really wanted to demand that she cooperate, but with both Crispen and Alaric staring expectantly at him, he snapped his lips shut and took a step back himself.</p><p>His muscles bulged in his arms and neck, and he took several breaths as if he were working to keep his patience. She felt sympathy for him, she truly did. If it were her child, she\u2019d demand, just as he had, every detail. And if it were true\u2014and Ewan had no reason to lie\u2014that Duncan Cameron was his mortal enemy, she could well understand why he looked at her with such mistrust and hatred. Aye, she understood well his dilemma. It didn\u2019t mean she was suddenly going to cooperate, however.</p><p>Gathering her nerve, and hoping she didn\u2019t sound boastful, she looked the laird in the eye. \u201cI did save your son, Laird. I would be most appreciative of what aid you could provide. I won\u2019t ask for much. A horse and maybe some food. I\u2019ll be on my way and no longer a bother.\u201d</p><p>Ewan no longer stared at her. Nay, he turned his face heavenward as if praying for either patience or deliverance. Maybe both.</p><p>\u201cA horse. Food.\u201d</p><p>He said the words, still looking up at the sky. Then he slowly lowered his head until those green eyes scorched the breath right out of her.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going anywhere, lass.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>Ewan stared at the woman before him, and it was all he could do not to shake her senseless. The little chit had audacity, he\u2019d hand her that. He didn\u2019t know what hold she had on his son, but he\u2019d soon get to the bottom of it.</p><p>Even Alaric seemed under her spell, and while he could understand it, because Lord, the lass was bonnie, it annoyed him that his brother sought to defend her against him.</p><p>She turned her chin up farther in defiance and the light caught her eyes. Blue. Not just blue but a brilliant hue that reminded him of the sky in spring just before summer took hold.</p><p>Her hair was bedraggled but the curls hung all the way down to her waist, a waist he could span with his hands. Aye, his hands would fit nicely in the curve between her hips and her breasts, and if he slid his hands up just a bit, he\u2019d cup the generous swell of her bosom.</p><p>She was beautiful. And she was trouble.</p><p>She was also in pain. She hadn\u2019t faked that.</p><p>Her eyes dimmed and he got a better view of the shadows that surrounded them. She was trying valiantly to hide her discomfort, but it radiated from her in almost discernible waves.</p><p>Her questioning would have to wait.</p><p>He raised his hand and motioned toward one of the women gathered on the perimeter.</p><p>\u201cSee to her needs,\u201d he ordered. \u201cHave a bath drawn. See that Gertie prepares her a plate of food. And for God\u2019s sake, give her something other than Cameron\u2019s colors to wear.\u201d</p><p>Two of the McCabe women hurried forward and each took an arm of the woman still standing by Alaric.</p><p>\u201cCareful now,\u201d Alaric cautioned. \u201cHer injuries are still paining her.\u201d</p><p>The women removed their hands and instead gestured toward her to precede them into the keep. She looked nervously around, and it was clear she had no desire to go in. She tucked her bottom lip between her teeth until Ewan was sure she\u2019d draw blood if she didn\u2019t cease.</p><p>Ewan sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not ordering your death, lass. You asked for a bath and food. Are you questioning my hospitality now?\u201d</p><p>She frowned, and her eyes narrowed as she gazed sharply at him. \u201cI asked for a horse and food. I\u2019ve no need of your hospitality. I\u2019d prefer to be on my way as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no horses to spare, and furthermore, you aren\u2019t going anywhere until I\u2019ve sorted this entire matter out. If you have no wish for a bath, I\u2019m sure the women would be happy to show you into the kitchens so you can eat.\u201d</p><p>He finished with a shrug that signaled he didn\u2019t care whether she bathed or not. That had been Alaric\u2019s idea, but didn\u2019t all women jump at the chance to wallow in a tub of hot water?</p><p>She pursed her lips as if to argue but evidently decided restraint was a better idea. \u201cI\u2019d like a bath.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThen I suggest you follow the women upstairs before I change my mind.\u201d</p><p>She turned, muttering something under her breath that he didn\u2019t catch. His eyes narrowed. The contrary lass was sorely trying his patience.</p><p>He looked around for his son only to see him running behind the women toward the keep.</p><p>\u201cCrispen,\u201d he called.</p><p>Crispen turned around, anxiety over being kept from the woman etched on his small brow.</p><p>\u201cCome here, son.\u201d</p><p>After another moment\u2019s hesitation, he launched himself toward Ewan, and Ewan caught him up in his arms once more.</p><p>His heart raced frantically as the sheer relief of holding his son again overwhelmed him. \u201cYou frightened ten years off me, lad. Don\u2019t ever scare your father like this again.\u201d</p><p>Crispen clung to Ewan\u2019s shoulders and burrowed his face into Ewan\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, Papa. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Ewan hung on to him far longer than necessary, until Crispen wiggled to be set free. He hadn\u2019t thought to see his son again, and if Alaric was to be believed, he had the woman to thank for it.</p><p>He looked over Crispen\u2019s head to Alaric, demanding answers from his silent brother. Alaric shrugged.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re wanting answers from me, you\u2019re looking to the wrong person.\u201d He gestured impatiently at Crispen. \u201cHe and the lass refused to tell me anything. The cheeky little brat demanded I return them both to you so that you could protect her.\u201d</p><p>Ewan frowned and looked Crispen in the eyes. \u201cIs this true, son?\u201d</p><p>Crispen looked decidedly guilty, but determination sparked in his green eyes. His lips twisted mutinously, and he tensed as if he expected Ewan to launch into a tirade.</p><p>\u201cI gave my word,\u201d Crispen said stubbornly. \u201cYou said a McCabe never breaks his word.\u201d</p><p>Ewan shook his head wearily. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to regret telling you of things a McCabe doesn\u2019t do. Come, let\u2019s sit in the hall so you can tell me of these adventures of yours.\u201d</p><p>He leveled a glance at Alaric, silently commanding his presence as well. Then he turned to Gannon. \u201cTake your men and ride north to find Caelan. Tell him Alaric has returned Crispen home. Return as quickly as you can.\u201d</p><p>Gannon bowed and hurried away, shouting orders as he went.</p><p>Ewan set Crispen down but kept a firm grip on his shoulder as he herded him into the keep. They walked into the hall amid a chorus of cries and exclamations. Crispen was soundly hugged by every passing woman and slapped on the back by the men of the clan. Finally Ewan waved them away so they were left alone in the hall.</p><p>Ewan sat at the table and patted the space next to him. Crispen hopped onto the bench while Alaric sat across the table from them.</p><p>\u201cNow tell me what happened,\u201d Ewan commanded.</p><p>Crispen looked down at his hands, his shoulders drooping.</p><p>\u201cCrispen,\u201d Ewan began gently. \u201cWhat else did I tell you McCabes always do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell the truth,\u201d Crispen said grudgingly.</p><p>Ewan smiled. \u201cIndeed. Now begin your tale.\u201d</p><p>Crispen sighed dramatically before saying, \u201cI snuck out to meet Uncle Alaric. I thought I\u2019d wait at the border and surprise him when he came home.\u201d</p><p>Alaric glared across the table at Crispen, but Ewan held up his hand.</p><p>\u201cLet him continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must have gone too far. One of the McDonald soldiers took me and said he was going to take me back to his laird to ransom me.\u201d</p><p>He turned pleading eyes on Ewan. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let him do that, Papa. It would shame you, and our clan can\u2019t afford a ransom. So I escaped and hid in the cart of a traveling merchant.\u201d</p><p>Ewan tensed in rage at the McDonald soldier, and his heart clenched at the pride in his son\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cYou could never shame me, Crispen,\u201d Ewan said quietly. \u201cNow go on with your story. What happened next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe merchant discovered me after a day and he chased me out. I didn\u2019t know where I was. I tried to steal a horse from men who were camping but they caught me. M\u2014I mean she saved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho saved you?\u201d Ewan demanded.</p><p>\u201cShe saved me.\u201d</p><p>Ewan swallowed his impatience. \u201cWho is she?\u201d</p><p>Crispen fidgeted uncomfortably. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you. I promised.\u201d</p><p>Ewan and Alaric exchanged frustrated glances, and Alaric raised one eyebrow as if to say I told you so.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Crispen, what exactly did you promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I wouldn\u2019t tell you who she was,\u201d Crispen blurted. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Papa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. What else did you promise?\u201d</p><p>Crispen looked puzzled for a moment, and across the table, Alaric smiled as he caught on to the direction Ewan was headed.</p><p>\u201cI just promised I wouldn\u2019t tell you her name.\u201d</p><p>Ewan stifled his grin. \u201cAll right, so continue with your story. The lady saved you. How did she do this? Was she camping with the men you tried to steal the horse from? Were they escorting her to a destination?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Crispen\u2019s brow creased as he struggled with whether he could divulge such information without breaking his promise.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t ask her name again,\u201d Ewan said solemnly.</p><p>Looking relieved, Crispen pursed his lips and then said, \u201cThe men took her from the abbey. She didn\u2019t want to be with them. I saw them bring her into the camp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod\u2019s teeth, she\u2019s a nun?\u201d Ewan exclaimed.</p> <p>Alaric shook his head adamantly. \u201cIf that woman is a nun, then I\u2019m a monk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you marry a nun?\u201d Crispen asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth would you ask a question like that?\u201d Ewan demanded.</p><p>\u201cDuncan Cameron wanted to marry her. If she\u2019s a nun, he can\u2019t, can he?\u201d</p><p>Ewan straightened and shot Alaric a fierce look. Then he turned to Crispen, trying to keep his reaction calm so that he didn\u2019t frighten his son.</p> <p>\u201cThe men you tried to steal the horse from. Were they Cameron soldiers? Were they the ones who took the woman from the abbey?\u201d</p><p>Crispen nodded solemnly. \u201cThey took us to Laird Cameron. He tried to make ... her ... marry him, but she refused. When she did, he beat her badly.\u201d</p><p>Tears welled in his eyes, and he made a fierce expression to hold them back.</p><p>Again, Ewan glanced over at Alaric to judge his reaction to the news. Who could this woman be that Duncan Cameron wanted her badly enough to steal her from an abbey? Was she an heiress sequestered there until her marriage?</p><p>\u201cWhat happened after he beat her?\u201d Ewan prompted.</p><p>Crispen swiped at his face, leaving a trail of dirt over his cheek.</p> <p>\u201cWhen she came back to the room, she could barely hold herself up. I had to help her to the bed. Later a woman woke us and said that the laird was in a drunken sleep and that he planned to threaten me to make her do what he wanted. She said we had to escape before he awoke. The lady was afraid but promised me she\u2019d protect me. And so I promised her that I would take us here to you so that you could protect her. You won\u2019t let Duncan Cameron marry her, will you, Papa? You won\u2019t let him hurt her again?\u201d</p><p>He gazed anxiously up at Ewan, his eyes so earnest and serious. He looked so much older than his eight years in that moment, as if he\u2019d taken on a great responsibility, one far greater than his age warranted, but one he was determined to follow through with.</p><p>\u201cNay, son. I won\u2019t allow Duncan Cameron to harm the lass.\u201d</p><p>Relief flooded Crispen9;s expression and suddenly he looked extremely weary. He swayed in his chair and leaned over on Ewan\u2019s arm.</p><p>For a long moment, Ewan stared down at his son\u2019s head, resisting the urge to run his fingers through the unruly tresses. Ewan couldn\u2019t help but feel a surge of pride at the way Crispen had fought for the woman who\u2019d saved him. According to Alaric, Crispen had bullied Alaric and his men the entire way back to the McCabe keep. And now he was bullying Ewan into keeping a promise Crispen had made in the McCabe name.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s asleep,\u201d Alaric murmured.</p><p>Ewan carefully ran his hand over his son\u2019s head and held him solidly against his side.</p><p>\u201cWho is this woman, Alaric? What is she to Cameron?\u201d</p> <p>Alaric made a sound of frustration. \u201cI wish I could tell you. The lass wouldn\u2019t say a word to me the entire time she was with me. She and Crispen were as tight-lipped as two monks with vows of silence. All I know is that when I found her, she was severely beaten. I\u2019ve never seen a lass abused as she was. It turned my stomach, Ewan. There\u2019s no excuse for a man to ever treat a woman such as he did. And yet, as badly injured as she was, she took on me and my men when she thought we were a threat to Crispen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said nothing the entire time she was with you? Let nothing slip? Think, Alaric. She had to have said something. It simply isn\u2019t a woman\u2019s nature to be silent for prolonged periods of time.\u201d</p><p>Alaric grunted. \u201cSomeone should tell her that. I\u2019m telling you, Ewan, she said nothing. She stared at me like I was some kind of toad. Worse, she had Crispen acting like I was the enemy. The two whispered like conspirators and glared at me when I dared intervene.\u201d</p><p>Ewan frowned and drummed his fingers on the solid wood of the table. \u201cWhat could Cameron want with her? Furthermore, what was a highland lass doing in a lowland abbey? Highlanders guard their daughters as jealously as gold. I can\u2019t see a daughter being packed off to an abbey days away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless the lass was being punished,\u201d Alaric pointed out. \u201cMaybe she was caught out in an indiscretion. More than one lass has been wooed between the sheets outside the sanctity of marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe she was a difficult harridan her father despaired of,\u201d Ewan murmured, as he remembered how difficult and recalcitrant she\u2019d been just moments ago. That scenario he could believe. But again, she would have had to have committed an egregious sin for a father to send her so far away.</p><p>Alaric chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s spirited all right.\u201d Then he sobered. \u201cBut she protected Crispen well. She put her body between him and others more than once, and she suffered greatly for it.\u201d</p><p>Ewan mulled on that truth for a long moment. Then he looked up at Alaric again. \u201cYou saw these injuries?\u201d</p><p>Alaric nodded. \u201cI did. Ewan, the bastard kicked her. There were imprints of a boot on her back.\u201d</p><p>p height=\"0em\" width=\"1em\" align=\"justify\"&gt;Ewan cursed, the sound echoing across the hall. \u201cI wish I knew what her connection to Cameron was. And why he wants her badly enough to abduct her from an abbey and beat her senseless when she refused to marry him. Why he\u2019d then think to use my son to sway her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would have worked, too,\u201d Alaric said in a grim voice. \u201cThe lass is very protective of Crispen. If Cameron had threatened him, she would have consented. I\u2019m positive of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis presents a problem for me,\u201d Ewan said quietly. \u201cCameron wants her. My son wants me to protect her. The lass only wants to be gone. And then there is the mystery of who she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Cameron discovers her whereabouts, he\u2019ll come for her,\u201d Alaric warned.</p><p>Ewan nodded. \u201cSo he will.\u201d</p><p>The brothers\u2019 gazes met and held. Alaric nodded his acceptance of Ewan\u2019s silent declaration. If Cameron wanted a fight, the McCabes would be more than willing to give him one.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the lass?\u201d Alaric finally asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make that determination once I\u2019ve heard the whole story from her,\u201d Ewan said.</p><p>He was confident that he could be a reasonable man, and once she saw how reasonable, she\u2019d cooperate fully.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>Mairin awoke with the knowledge that she wasn\u2019t alone in the tiny chamber she\u2019d been sleeping in. Her nape prickled and she carefully opened one eye to see Ewan McCabe standing in the doorway.</p><p>Sunlight peeked through the window, penetrating the gap in the furs. The light somehow made him more ominous than if he stood cloaked in darkness. In the light, she could see how big he was. He made a menacing portrait, framed by the doorway he barely fit through.</p><p>\u201cPardon the intrusion,\u201d Ewan said in a gruff voice. \u201cI was trying to locate my son.\u201d</p><p>It was then, as she followed his gaze to the bundle beside her, that she realized Crispen had crawled into her bed during the night. He was snuggled firmly into her side, the covers pulled tight to his neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t realize ...,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cSince I tucked him into my bed last night, I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t realize,\u201d he said dryly. \u201c \u2019Tis apparent he made the move during the night.\u201d</p><p>She started to move, but Ewan held up a hand. \u201cNay, don\u2019t wake him. I\u2019m sure you both need your rest. I\u2019ll have Gertie hold the morning meal for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cT\u2014Thank you.\u021d</p><p>She stared helplessly up at him, unsure of what to do with his sudden kindness. Yesterday he\u2019d been so fierce, his scowl had been enough to frighten a man out of his boots. After a short nod, he backed out of the room and closed the door behind him.</p><p>She frowned. She didn\u2019t trust such an about-face. Then she glanced down at the sleeping boy next to her, and her frown eased. Gently, she touched his hair, marveling at how the limp curls framed his face. In time, it would be as long as his father\u2019s.</p><p>Perhaps the laird had calmed in the face of his son\u2019s safe return. Maybe he was even feeling grateful and was sorry for his gruffness.</p><p>Hope tightened her chest. He might be more amenable to giving her a mount and supplies. She had no good idea where to flee, but given that Duncan Cameron appeared to be Ewan McCabe\u2019s sworn enemy, it wasn\u2019t a good idea for her to remain there.</p><p>Sadness tugged at her heart and she squeezed Crispen closer to her. The abbey that had been her home for so long, and the comforting presence of the sisters, was no longer available to her. She was without a home and safe harbor.</p><p>Closing her eyes, she whispered a fervent prayer for God\u2019s mercy and protection. Surely He would provide for her in her hour of need.</p><p>When she next awoke, Crispen was gone from her bed. She stretched and flexed her toes then immediately winced as pain snaked through her body. Even a hot bath and a comfortable bed hadn\u2019t completely rid her of her discomfort. Still, she could move considerably better than she had the day before, and she was certainly well enough to sit a horse on her own.</p><p>Throwing aside the furs, she braced her feet on the stone floor and flinched at the chill. She rose and went to the window to throw back the covering to allow the sunlight to stream in.</p><p>The rays slid over her like liquid amber. She closed her eyes and turned her face into the sun, eagerly soaking up the warmth.</p><p>It was a beautiful day as only a spring day in the highlands could be. She stared over the hillsides, basking in the comfort of seeing home for the first time in many long years. In truth, there\u2019d been many days when she\u2019d despaired of ever seeing heaven again. Neamh \u00c1lainn. Beautiful heaven. One day she\u2019d gaze upon her legacy\u2014her child\u2019s legacy. The only part of her father she\u2019d ever have.</p><p>She curled her fingers into tight fists. \u201cI will not fail,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Not wanting to waste any more time above stairs, she donned the simple gown one of the serving women had left for her. The neckline was embroidered with a feminine chain of flowers, and in the middle, in green and gold, was what she assumed was the McCabe coat of arms. Glad to be wearing something other than Duncan Cameron\u2019s colors, she hurried toward the door.</p><p>When she neared the bottom of the stairs, she hesitated, feeling suddenly unsure of herself. She was saved from making an awkward entrance into the hall when one of the McCabe women saw her. The woman smiled and hurried over to greet her.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon. Are you feeling better today?\u201d</p><p>Mairin winced. \u201cIs it afternoon already? I didn\u2019t mean to sleep the day away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needed the rest. You looked fair to dropping yesterday. My name is Christina, by the way. By what name do you call yourself?\u201d</p><p>Mairin colored, feeling suddenly foolish. She wondered if she should make up a name, but she hated the idea of lying.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Christina\u2019s eyebrows shot up, but to her credit she didn\u2019t react further. Then she reached for Mairin\u2019s arm and tucked it into hers.</p><p>\u201cWell then, lady, let\u2019s take you into the kitchens before Gertie feeds your meal to the hounds.\u201d</p><p>Feeling relieved that Christina hadn\u2019t pressed her, she allowed the girl to drag her into the kitchen where an older woman stood tending a fire in the pit. Mairin had expected a matronly woman, and why, she wasn\u2019t sure. Shouldn\u2019t women charged with the cooking be motherly?</p><p>Gertie was bone thin, and her gray hair was pulled into a tight knot at her nape. Strands escaped on all sides until they flew about her face, giving her a look of wildness. She pinned Mairin with a sharp glance that peeled back several layers of Mairin\u2019s skin.</p><p>\u201cAbout time you got up and around, lass. No one stays abed here for that long unless they\u2019re dying. I don\u2019t expect you\u2019re dying since you\u2019re standing before me looking hale and hearty. Don\u2019t make a habit of it, or I won\u2019t hold the morning meal for you again.\u201d</p><p>Taken aback, Mairin\u2019s first instinct was to laugh, but she wasn\u2019t sure whether the other woman would take offense. Instead she folded her hands solemnly in front of her and promised never to do so again. A vow she felt comfortable making since she didn\u2019t plan to spend another night in the McCabe keep.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat then. There\u2019s a stool in the corner. You can take your meal there. No sense messing up the table in the hall again for one person.\u201d</p><p>Mairin meekly obeyed and made quick work of the trencher of food. Gertie and Christina watched as she ate, and Mairin could hear them whispering when they thought Mairin wasn\u2019t looking.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t tell you her name?\u201d Gertie exclaimed loudly.</p><p>She turned in Mairin\u2019s direction and uttered a hmmph. \u201cWhen people won\u2019t give their name, \u2019tis because they have something to hide. What are you hiding, lass? Don\u2019t be thinking our laird won\u2019t find out. He\u2019s too precise to take such nonsense from a slip of a lass like yourself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll discuss the matter with your laird and only your laird,\u201d Mairin said firmly. She hoped that by injecting enough strength into her voice she\u2019d make the other woman back down. Gertie st rolled her eyes and resumed tending her fire.</p><p>\u201cCan you take me to him?\u201d Mairin asked Christina as she rose from the stool. \u201cI really must speak to him right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Lady,\u201d Christina said in her sweet voice. \u201cI was instructed to take you to him the moment you finished eating.\u201d</p><p>The food Mairin had just consumed swirled in her gut like sour ale.</p> <p>\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d Christina asked as they descended the steps from the keep. \u201cYou have no reason to be. The laird seems gruff, and he can be stern when crossed, but he\u2019s fair and very evenhanded with our clan.\u201d</p><p>The part that Christina left out was that Mairin wasn\u2019t part of the McCabe clan, which meant that any policies about fair and evenhanded didn\u2019t apply. But she had saved Crispen, and it was obvious that the laird loved his son. She held on to that thought as they rounded the corner into the courtyard.</p><p>Mairin\u2019s eyes widened at the site of so many men training. The clash of swords and shields nearly deafened her, and the afternoon sun striking the metal made her squint and wince. She blinked and focused her gaze away from the reflections dancing through the air. When she realized what she was seeing instead, she gasped.</p><p>Her hand fluttered to her chest, and her vision went a bit blurry. It wasn\u2019t until her tortured lungs begged for mercy that she realized she was holding her breath. She sucked in a mouthful of air, but that didn\u2019t help her light-headedness.</p><p>The laird was sparring with another soldier in only his boots and trews. His bare chest gleamed with a sheen of sweat, and a trickle of blood slid down his side.</p> <p>Oh merciful heavens.</p><p>She watched in fascination, unable to make herself tear her gaze away, no matter that it was surely a sin to ogle in this fashion.</p><p>The laird was broad shouldered. His massive chest sported several scars. A man didn\u2019t get to be his age without acquiring battle scars. Badges of honor to highlanders. A man without them was considered weak and without courage.</p><p>His hair clung damply to his back and his braids swung about him as he pivoted in the dirt to parry another thrust by his opponent. His muscles strained and bulged as he swung the heavy sword about his head and slashed downward. At the last moment, his opponent threw up his shield, but he still buckled under the blow.</p><p>The younger man went sprawling, his own sword clattering to the ground. He did have the presence of mind to cover himself with the shield as he lay there panting softly.</p><p>The laird frowned but extended his hand down to the younger soldier. \u201cYou lasted longer this time, Heath, but you\u2019re still allowing emotion to rule your actions. Until you learn to control that temper of yours, you\u2019ll prove an easy mark in battle.\u201d</p> <p>Heath scowled and didn\u2019t look appreciative of his laird\u2019s criticism. He ignored Ewan\u2019s outstretched hand and scrambled to his feet, his face red with anger.</p><p>It was then that the laird looked up and saw Mairin standing there with Christina. His eyes narrowed and she felt pinned by the force of his stare. He motioned for his tunic, which Alaric tossed to him from the side. After hastily pulling it over his bare chest, he motioned for Mairin to come forward.</p><p>Feeling strangely disappointed that he\u2019d put the tunic back on, she edged closer, all but dragging her heels in the dirt. It was silly. She was a grown woman, but in front of this man, she felt like an errant child about to be called to task.</p><p>Guilty conscience. A good confession would clear that up.</p><p>\u201cCome walk with me, lass. We have much to discuss.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and snuck a peek at Christina, who performed a curtsy in the laird\u2019s direction before turning and heading back the way they\u2019d come.</p><p>His teeth flashed into a grin. \u201cCome,\u201d he said again. \u201cI don\u2019t bite.\u201d</p><p>The flash of humor caught her unawares and she smiled broadly, quite unaware of its effect on the men who saw it.</p> <p>\u201cVery well, Laird. Since you\u2019ve offered me such reassurance, I\u2019ll take the risk and accompany you.\u201d</p><p>They walked from the courtyard and took a path that led up the hillside that overlooked the loch. At the top, the laird stopped and stared out over the water.</p><p>\u201cMy son says I have much to thank you for.\u201d</p><p>She folded her hands in front of her, gathering a bit of the material of her gown in her fingers. \u201cHe\u2019s a good lad. He helped me as much as I helped him.\u201d</p><p>The laird nodded. \u201cSo he told me. He brought you to me.\u201d</p><p>Mairin didn\u2019t like the way he said the last. There was too much possession in his voice.</p><p>\u201cLaird, I must depart today. If you cannot spare a horse, I understand. I\u2019ll leave on foot, though I would appreciate an escort to your border.\u201d</p><p>He turned to her with an uplifted eyebrow. \u201cOn foot? You wouldn\u2019t make it far, lass. You\u2019d be tossed over someone\u2019s saddle and spirited away the moment you left my land.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cNot if I\u2019m careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs careful as you were when you got yourself abducted by Duncan Cameron\u2019s men?\u201d</p><p>Heat rose in her cheeks. \u201cThat\u2019s different. I wasn\u2019t expecting ...\u201d</p><p>Faint amusement glittered in his eyes. \u201cDoes anyone ever expect to be abducted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u020cTell me something, lass. You appear to be someone who firmly believes in a promise. I\u2019d wager you expect people to remain true to their word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh aye,\u201d she said fervently.</p><p>\u201cAnd you exacted a promise from my son, is this not so?\u201d</p><p>She looked down. \u201cAye, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you expect him to keep that promise, do you not?\u201d</p><p>She squirmed uncomfortably but nodded even as guilt filled her.</p><p>\u201cAs it turns out, Crispen also exacted a promise from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat promise?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cTo protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say to that. Somehow she had just maneuvered herself into a trap. She knew it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say \u2019tis hard to protect a lass if she\u2019s out running all over the highlands on foot, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p><p>She scowled, unhappy with the direction this conversation was headed.</p><p>\u201cI release you from his promise,\u201d she declared.</p><p>He shook his head, a smile lifting the corners of his mouth. Shocked, she stared transfixed at the change such a gesture wrought on his features. My, but he was quite handsome. Really handsome. And he looked younger, not as hardened, though she\u2019d seen the scars, so she knew he was anything but soft. Nay, he was a warrior. There was no telling how many men he\u2019d killed in battle. Why, he could probably snap someone\u2019s neck with his fingers. Certainly hers.</p><p>The thought had her reaching up to cover her throat.</p><p>\u201cOnly Crispen can release me from that promise, lass. As I\u2019m sure he told you, a McCabe always keeps his word.\u201d</p><p>Glumly, she remembered Crispen saying just that. She also remembered his vow to her that his father would protect her. She\u2019d been too bent on self-preservation to really give thought to what that meant.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying I can\u2019t leave?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He seemed to consider her question for a moment, his gaze never straying from her. He stared until she squirmed under his scrutiny.</p><p>\u201cIf I knew you had a safe place to go, then of course I\u2019d allow you to go. To your family perhaps?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to lie and say she had family, so she said nothing at all.</p><p>The laird sighed. \u201cTell me your name, lass. Tell me why Duncan Cameron was so adamant that you marry him. I\u2019ve promised Crispen I\u2019d protect you, and I will, but I can\u2019t do so unless I have all the facts.\u201d</p><p>Oh dear, he was going to get all gruff again when she refused to obey his command. He\u2019d been ready to throttle her the day before. A night\u2019s sleep probably hadn\u2019t tempered the desire, no matter how patient he seemed to be at the moment.</p><p>Instead of openly defying him as she\u2019d done yesterday, she stood mute, hands still folded in front of her.</p><p>\u201cYou realize, I\u2019ll find out soon enough. It would be better on you if you simply told me what I want to know now. I don\u2019t like to be kept waiting. I\u2019m not a patient man. Particularly when those under my command defy me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not under your command,\u201d she blurted before she could think better of it.</p><p>\u201cThe moment you stepped onto my land, you came under my command. My son\u2019s promise put you solidly under my care and protection. My promise to my son solidified that. You will obey me.\u201d</p><p>She raised her chin, staring directly into those piercing green eyes. \u201cI survived at Duncan Cameron\u2019s hands. I\u2019ll survive at yours. You can\u2019t make me tell you anything. Beat me if you must, but I will not tell you what you want to know.\u201d</p><p>Outrage sparked in his eyes, and his mouth gaped open. \u201cYou think I\u2019d beat you? Do you think me the same manner of man as Cameron?\u201d</p><p>The fury in his voice had her stepping back. She\u2019d struck a nerve, and anger rolled off the laird\u2019s shoulders in thunderous waves. He all but snarled his question at her.</p><p>\u201cI did not intend any insult. I do not know what manner of man you are. I\u2019ve only made your acquaintance for a short time, and you must admit, our meeting has been less than amicable.\u201d</p><p>The laird turned away, his hand going to his hair. She didn\u2019t know if he intended to pull it in frustration or to prevent himself from wrapping those fingers around her neck.</p><p>When he turned around, his eyes blazed with purpose, and he advanced on her, closing the distance between them. She took another rapid step back, but he was there, looming over her, bristling with outrage.</p><p>\u201cNever, never have I treated man or woman in the manner Cameron treated you. Dogs are treated with better regard than that. Never make the mistake of comparing me with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA\u2014Aye, Laird.\u201d</p><p>He raised his hand, and it was all she could do not to flinch. How she stood so stoic, she didn\u2019t know, but it seemed important she didn\u2019t show fear that he\u2019d strike her. Instead, he touched a strand of her hair that whispered down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cNo one will hurt you here. You will trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t command someone to trust you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I can, and you willngers ar9;m giving you until tomorrow to decide you trust me enough to tell me what I want to know. I am your laird, and you will obey me as everyone else here obeys me. Is that understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ... that\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d she sputtered, forgetting her fear of angering him further. \u201cThat\u2019s the most absurd thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>She turned her back to him, telling him without words what she thought of his dictate. As she stomped away, she missed the amused smile that settled over Ewan\u2019s face.</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>Mairin spent the afternoon studying the keep\u2019s defenses and looking for a possible escape route. The laird hadn\u2019t given her any choice in the matter. While she kept a sharp eye peeled to the goings-on around her, she also considered the matter of just where she would travel.</p><p>Duncan would scour the other abbeys. That was too obvious a choice to make. Her mother\u2019s people hailed from the western isles, but her mother had disassociated herself from her clan even before she\u2019d become the king\u2019s mistress.</p><p>And truthfully, she couldn\u2019t count on them not knowing of Neamh \u00c1lainn. She\u2019d find herself married off to the first man who had knowledge of her inheritance. She needed time. Time to consider the best course.</p><p>Mother Serenity had been working with Mairin to form a list of possible candidates for marriage. Mairin hadn\u2019t wanted a warrior, but she\u2019d recognized the need to have one as her husband. From the moment she claimed her legacy, her husband would have to spend the rest of his life defending it from greedy, power-hungry men.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t that the way of the world, though? Only the strong survived, and the weak perished.</p><p>She frowned. Nay, that wasn\u2019t true. God protected the weak. Perhaps that\u2019s why he made warriors, so they could protect women and children. Which meant Duncan Cameron could only be of the devil.</p><p>With a sigh, she planted her hands down on the sun-warmed ground, intending to push herself to her feet so she could return to her room to best plot her escape. Before she could fully rise, she saw Crispen running up the hillside, waving his hand to her.</p><p>She sank back to the ground and waited for him to catch up to her. His face split into a wide grin and he flopped onto the ground beside her.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling more yourself today?\u201d he asked politely.</p><p>\u201cI feel much better. I\u2019ve been moving about to work out the soreness.\u201d</p><p>He snuggled into her side. \u201cI\u2019m glad. Did you speak to Papa?\u201d</p><p>Mairin sighed. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>Crispen beamed up at her. \u201cI told you he would ta care of everything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIndeed you did,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cSo are you staying?\u201d</p><p>The hopeful expression on his face made her heart melt.

There are men besides Duncan Cameron who would abduct me if they knew who I was.\u201d</p><p>Crispen\u2019s face crinkled until his nose twitched. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201c \u2019Tis complicated,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI wish it were different, but Mother Serenity always told me we have to make the best with what we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will you leave and where will you go? Will I see you again?\u201d</p><p>Here she had to tread lightly. She couldn\u2019t have Crispen running to his father with news of her departure. Now that she\u2019d made the decision to leave on her own, she didn\u2019t want the laird interfering with his demand to trust him. She nearly snorted at that notion. He might be able to command his clan to trust him, and she was sure it did, but a woman in her position couldn\u2019t afford to trust anyone.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet. Departures take planning.\u201d</p><p>He turned his chin up so that he was looking up into her eyes. \u201cWill you tell me before you leave so I can say good-bye?\u201d</p> <p>Her heart ached at the idea of leaving the lad she\u2019d grown so fond of over the past days. But she wouldn\u2019t lie and tell him she would when she knew well that she wouldn\u2019t be announcing her departure to anyone.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise, Crispen. Perhaps we should say our good-byes now so that we\u2019re sure to say everything we want to say.\u201d</p><p>He rose up and flung his arms around her, nearly knocking her back to the ground.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said fiercely. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to go.\u201d</p><p>She hugged him to her and pressed a kiss to the top of his head. \u201cI love you, too, dearling. I\u2019ll always keep you close in my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cThat I can promise, and I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you sit by me for the evening meal tonight?\u201d</p><p>Since she didn\u2019t plan to leave until everyone else was abed, his request was reasonable enough. She nodded, and he beamed back at her.</p><p>A shout went up from the courtyard that Mairin and Crispen heard all the way up the hillside. She turned in the direction of the noise to see a procession of soldiers on horses parading over the bridge and into the keep.</p><p>Crispen launched himself from her hold and ran several feet before stopping. \u201cA0;\u2019Tis Uncle Caelen! He\u2019s back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen of course you must go greet him,\u201d Mairin said with a smile.</p><p>He ran back to her and grabbed her hand, attempting to pull her up. \u201cYou come, too.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and pulled her hand away. \u201cI\u2019ll just stay here. You go ahead. I\u2019ll be along in a little while.\u201d</p> <p>The last thing she needed was to make the acquaintance of yet another McCabe brother. She shuddered. He was probably just as infuriating as Ewan and Alaric.</p><p>Ewan arrived to greet Caelen just as Caelen slid from his horse and strode in Ewan\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cIs it true? Has Crispen been returned?\u201d Caelen demanded.</p><p>\u201cAye, \u2019tis true. Alaric brought him home yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, where is the little brat?\u201d</p><p>Ewan smiled just as Crispen tore through the courtyard shouting \u201cUncle Caelen\u201d at the top of his lungs. Caelen went white and staggered backward before righting himself and catching the mass of wiggling boy that hurled himself into Caelen\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cGod be praised,\u201d Caelen breathed. \u201cYou\u2019re alive.\u201d</p><p>Crispen threw his arms around Caelen\u2019s neck and hung on for dear life. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Uncle Caelen. I didn\u2019t mean to frighten you and Papa. But don\u2019t worry, Mairin took good care of me.\u201d</p><p>Ewan\u2019s eyebrows went up. Beside him Alaric also took note of Crispen\u2019s slip.</p><p>Caelen scowled over Crispen\u2019s head at Ewan. \u201cWho the hell is Mairin?\u201d</p><p>Crispen went rigid in Caelen\u2019s arms, and then he struggled until Caelen finally put him down. He turned stricken eyes toward Ewan, torment in his gaze.</p><p>\u201cOh nay, Papa, I broke my promise. I broke it!\u201d</p><p>Ewan reached for his son and squeezed his shoulder reassuringly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t mean to, son. If it\u2019ll make you feel better, I\u2019ll order Alaric and Caelen to forget it immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you, Papa?\u201d Crispen asked anxiously. \u201cWill you forget it as well?\u201d</p><p>Ewan suppressed a chuckle and then glanced at his brothers. \u201cWe will all three endeavor to forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill someone tell me what the blazes is going on?\u201d Caelen demanded. \u201cAnd does it have anything to do with the strange woman sitting on the hillside?\u201d</p><p>Ewan followed Caelen\u2019s gaze to where Mairin sat on the hill that overlooked the keep. Trust Caelen to have immediately observed a stranger in the keep. He was exceedingly cautious about who gained access. A lesson learned the hard way.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not staying,\u201d Crispen said unhappily.</p><p>Ewan turned sharply toward his son. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEwan? Am I going to have to beat the information from you?\u201d Caelen asked.</p><p>Ewan held up his hand to silence Caelen. \u201cDid she say anything else, Crispen?\u201d</p><p>Crispen frowned and opened his mouth but then shut it promptly again, his lips forming a tight, mutinous line. \u201cI already broke my promise,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t say anything else.\u201d</p><p>Ewan sighed and shook his head. This whole bloody mess was enough to give him a giant ache in his temples. God save him from stubborn, secretive females. Worse, she\u2019d completely won his son\u2019s heart, and she couldn\u2019t leave the keep fast enough.</p><p>He frowned at that thought. It wasn\u2019t as though he wanted her to stay. He didn\u2019t want Crispen hurt, but neither did he want the hassle of a difficult woman or the trouble she brought with her.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you run along so I can properly welcome your uncle home. I have much I need to discuss with Caelen and Alaric.\u201d</p><p>Instead of looking offended, Crispen\u2019s eyes glimmered with relief. He turned and headed straight back up the hill toward where Mairin had sat. Only now she was gone. Ewan glanced around for the direction she\u2019d taken, but she was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>\u201cMairin? Who the hell is Mairin and what does she have to do with Crispen? Furthermore, what is she doing here?\u201d</p><p>Ewan jerked his thumb in Alaric\u2019s direction. \u201cHe brought her.\u201d</p><p>As expected, Alaric immediately denied his part in the whole mess. Ewan held back his laughter at the weariness in Alaric\u2019s voice.</p><p>Caelen was close to losing his patience, not that he had much, so Ewan told him everything he knew. Alaric filled in some of the information, and when they were done, Caelen looked at Ewan in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cShe would tell you nothing? And you allowed this?\u201d</p><p>Ewan sighed. \u201cWhat would you have me do, beat her as Cameron did? The lass will come around. I\u2019ve given her until tomorrow to decide to trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what will you do when she refuses tomorrow?\u201d Alaric smirked.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t refuse me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe important thing is we have Crispen back,\u201d Caelen said. \u201cWhat the woman does or says is irrelevant. If Cameron comes looking for a fight, I\u2019ll be more than happy to give him one and then we\u2019ll send the woman on her way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome, \u2019tis getting dark and Gertie will have dinner waiting. She doesn\u2019t like to serve a cold meal and well you know it,\u201d Ewan said. \u201cLeave the matter of Mairin to me. The two of you needn\u2019t concern yourself over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if we\u2019d want to,\u201d Caelen muttered, as he shouldered past Ewan.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>Mairin gathered her shawl closer around her body and crept over the crumbling wall of the stone skirt. She\u2019d chosen the pathway closest to the loch because fewer guards were posted on that side. After all, an enemy could hardly come barging over the water to attack.</p><p>The spring air had a decided nip, and suddenly the decision to leave the warmth of her small chamber didn\u2019t seem so wonderful.</p><p>The evening repast had been a stressful event. She\u2019d taken one look at the laird\u2019s youngest brother and thought better of her promise to sit next to Crispen at the table. He scowled at her, and it wasn\u2019t as if she hadn\u2019t been treated to scowls from the other McCabe brothers, but there was a darkness to Caelen\u2019s frown that unnerved her.</p><p>She\u2019d uttered an excuse about not feeling well and had immediately retreated above stairs. Undaunted by her departure, Crispen brought a plate of food to her door, and the two of them had sat cross-legged in front of the fire to eat.</p><p>Afterward, she pleaded fatigue and sent Crispen on his way. And she waited. For hours she listened for the sounds of the keep to diminish. When she was sure everyone was abed, or at least safely ensconced in their quarters, she snuck down the stairs and out the entrance that faced the loch.</p><p>She breathed easier when she entered the shelter of the trees that divided part of the loch from the keep. Here she could move with relative obscurity and follow the loch until she was away.</p><p>A great splash startled her, and she turned in the direction of the water. She went still, holding her breath as she peered through the trees toward the inky black water. There was barely a moon this night, and only a slim light was cast onto the rippling surface.</p><p>It was enough for her to see that three men were taking a late swim. It was also enough for her to see who was taking the swim. Ewan McCabe and his brothers were diving into the loch, and God have mercy on her, they didn\u2019t have a stitch of clothing on.</p><p>She immediately covered her eyes with both hands, mortified beyond all measure that she\u2019d just seen the backsides of three grown men. Were they mad? The loch had to be incredibly cold. She shivered at the mere thought of just how icy such a swim would be.</p><p>For several minutes she sat, hunkered down by a tree, hands covering her eyes until finally she eased them away only to see Ewan McCabe come walking from the water. Her eyes rounded in shock, and her hands hung limply at her sides as she stared, transfixed by the sight of a fully naked man. He stood, drying himself with acloth, and each stroke only drew attention to his muscled body. And ... And ... she couldn\u2019t even bring herself to think about the area between his legs.</p><p>When she realized she was staring quite unabashedly at his ... his ... manhood, she promptly clapped both hands over her eyes again and sank her teeth into her bottom lip to stifle the squeak that threatened to spill out.</p><p>Her only hope was that they would finish their swim and go back to the keep. She couldn\u2019t risk moving about in the trees and attracting attention, but neither did she want to sit here staring immodestly.</p><p>Heat suffused her cheeks, and though she kept her eyes firmly covered, the image of Ewan McCabe without clothing burned through her mind with astonishing clarity. No matter what she did, she couldn\u2019t rid herself of the memory of him walking from the water\u2014completely and utterly naked.</p><p>It would take at least three confessions to atone for this much sinning.</p><p>\u201cYou can look now. I assure you I am fully clothed.\u201d</p><p>The laird\u2019s dry voice slid with agonizing precision over her ears. Mortification billowed over her, and her cheeks grew so tight with humiliation that all she could think to do was sit there, hands still covering her eyes. Maybe if she wished really hard, when she opened her eyes, the laird would be far, far away.</p><p>\u201cNot likely,\u201d came the amused reply.</p><p>She dropped one hand to her mouth, which is where it should have been all along so nothing stupid slipped out, like the fact that she\u2019d just wished the laird to be a great distance away.</p><p>Now that she had one eye uncovered, she chanced a look at him to see that he was indeed clothed. With that established, she let her other hand slip down as she looked nervously at the laird.</p><p>He stood, legs apart, arms crossed over his chest, and, predictably, he was scowling.</p><p>\u201cWant to tell me what you\u2019re doing skulking around in the dark?\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders sagged. Apparently she couldn\u2019t even muster a good escape. How was she to know he and his brothers liked taking idiotic swims so late?</p><p>\u201cDo I have to answer that?\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>The laird sighed. \u201cWhat part of me telling you that you weren\u2019t leaving my protection did you not understand? I don\u2019t take kindly to those under my authority blatantly disregarding my orders. If you were one of my soldiers, I\u2019d kill you.\u201d</p><p>The last didn\u2019t sound like a boast. He didn\u2019t even say it with any flair, so she was sure it wasn\u2019t said to impress her. Nay, it was God\u2019s truth, and that served to scare her even more.</p><p>Some demon prompted her to deny his claim. \u201cI\u2019m not under your authority, Laird. I\u2019m not sure how you came to that notion, but \u2019tis quite unue. I\u2019m not under anyone\u2019s authority, save God\u2019s and my own.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The laird smirked back at her, his teeth glinting in the low moonlight. \u201cFor a lass determined to make her own way, you\u2019ve done a poor job of it.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cThat\u2019s very uncharitable of you to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make it any less true. Now if we\u2019re done with this conversation, I suggest we return to the keep, preferably before my son vacates my chambers and goes to seek you out in yours. He seems to have a certain affinity for sleeping with you. I don\u2019t like to imagine his reaction when he finds your bed empty.\u201d</p><p>Oh, that was simply unfair, and the laird well knew it. He was manipulating her emotions and striving to make her feel guilt for leaving Crispen. She frowned sharply at him to let him know of her displeasure, but he ignored her and took her arm in his strong fingers.</p> <p>She had no choice but to allow him to herd her back in the direction of the keep. He marched her around the stone skirt and through the courtyard where he paused to issue a sharp command to his guard that she was not to be allowed to escape again. Then he proceeded into the keep, and to her further dismay, insisted on escorting her all the way back to her chamber.</p><p>He opened her door and thrust her inside. Then he stood in the doorway, glaring ferociously at her.</p><p>\u201cIf you intend to intimidate me with mean looks, you\u2019re destined to fail,\u201d she said airily.</p><p>His eyes went heavenward for a moment, and she could swear he was counting under his breath. He took a second, as if trying to collect his flagging patience, which amused her, considering he didn\u2019t seem to possess any.</p><p>\u201cIf I have to bar the door, I will. I can be a very accommodating man, lass, but you\u2019ve sorely tried my will. I\u2019ve given you until tomorrow to trust me with whatever you\u2019re hiding. After that, I can promise you won\u2019t like my hospitality any longer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it now,\u201d she said crossly. She waved her hand in his direction. \u201cYou can leave. I\u2019ll only be going to bed now.\u201d</p><p>His jaw ticked, and his fingers flexed at his sides. She wondered if he was imagining those fingers around her neck. He looked to be contemplating such a thing right that very moment.</p><p>Then, as if to contradict her command, he stalked forward until he loomed forbiddingly over her. His jaw still twitched, and his eyes narrowed as he stared down at her.</p><p>He touched his fingertip to the end of her nose. \u201cYou don\u2019t make the rules here, lass. I do. It would be in your best interests to remember that.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, suddenly very overwhelmed by the sheer size of him. \u201cI will endeavor to remember.\u201d</p><p>The laird gave a short nod then turned on his heel and left the room, slamming the door with a bang.</p> <p>Mairin flopped onto the straw mattress and sighed in disgust. That had not gone the way she intended. She was supposed to be well away from McCabe land by now, or at the very least to the border. Her plan had been to venture north, because there was nothing for her to the south.</p><p>Now she was stuck in the keep with an overbearing laird who thought he could command her trust as easily as he commanded his soldiers. He\u2019d find out on the morrow that she wasn\u2019t so easily bent to another\u2019s will.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>\u201cLaird! Laird!\u201d</p><p>Ewan frowned and looked up from the table to see Maddie McCabe rush into the room, her face flushed with exertion.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Maddie? I\u2019m in talks here.\u201d</p><p>Maddie ignored the reprimand and stopped just a few feet away. She was so agitated, she wrung her hands.</p><p>\u201cWith your permission, Laird, there is something I must tell you.\u201d She glanced surreptitiously around and then confided in a low whisper, \u201cPrivately, Laird. \u2019Tis very important!\u201d</p> <p>An ache began in Ewan\u2019s temples. So far, the morning had been filled with dramatics. The evening before as well, as he remembered his encounter with Mairin. The lass hadn\u2019t showed herself as of yet, and he was sure she was being purposely difficult. As soon as he was finished with Alaric and Caelen, he planned to confront her and tell her that her time was up.</p><p>Ewan raised his hand and gestured for his men to leave. He caught Alaric\u2019s and Caelen\u2019s gazes and nodded for them to stay. Anything Maddie had to say could be said in front of them.</p><p>As soon as the rest of his soldiers filed out, Ewan returned his attention to Maddie.</p><p>\u201cNow, what is so important that you\u2019d interrupt a meeting with my men?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis the lass,\u201d she began, and Ewan groaned.</p><p>\u201cWhat now? Has she refused to eat? Has she threatened to throw herself from her window? Or perhaps she\u2019s disappeared?\u201d</p><p>Maddie sent him a puzzled look. \u201cOf course not, Laird. She\u2019s above stairs in her chamber. I brought her morning meal myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what about her?\u201d Ewan growled.</p><p>Maddie let out a breath as if she\u2019d run the entire way. \u201cMay I sit, Laird? For truly, \u2019tis not a short tale I\u2019ll be telling you.\u201d</p><p>Caelen rolled his eyes while Alaric looked bored. Ewan gestured her to sit.</p><p>She settled down and pressed her hands into a single fist before setting it on the table before her.</p><p>\u201cThe lass is Mairin Stuart.\u201d</p><p>She dropped the announcement as if she expected Ewan to react in some way.</p><p>\u201cI know the lass\u2019s name is Mairin. I hadn\u2019t known her family name, but \u2019tis a common enough name in the highlands. The question is how did you gain this information? She\u2019s refused to tell anyone who she is. If Crispen hadn\u2019t let it slip, I wouldn\u2019t have known myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, she didn\u2019t tell me. I knew, you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, I don\u2019t see. Perhaps you better tell me,\u201d Ewan said patiently.</p><p>\u201cWhen I went up to bring her meal, I came in on her dressing. It was all quite awkward, and I apologized of course, but before she covered herself, I saw the mark.\u201d</p><p>Maddie\u2019s voice rose again and she sat forward, her eyes gleaming with excitement.</p><p>Ewan stared expectantly at her, waiting for her to continue. Lord, but the woman did love a good story. His brothers sat back, resigned to Maddie\u2019s colorful retelling.</p><p>\u201cThe lass is Mairin Stuart,\u201d she said again. \u201cShe bears the royal crest of Alexander. I saw it, branded on her leg. She\u2019s the heir to Neamh \u00c1lainn.\u201d</p><p>Ewan shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s a bunch of nonsense, Maddie. \u2019Tis naught but a legend circulated on the tongues of bards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat legend?\u201d Alaric asked as he sat forward. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of no such legend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you never listen to bards,\u201d Caelen said dryly. \u201cYou\u2019re much too busy during festive times tossing up the skirts of some wench.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you listen to these poets and singers?\u201d Alaric mocked.</p><p>Caelen shrugged. \u201c \u2019Tis a good way to keep abreast of the current gossip.\u201d</p><p>Maddie\u2019s eyes gleamed as she turned her attention to Alaric. \u201cThe story goes that King Alexander had a child after his marriage to Sybilla, a daughter. And that at her birth, he had his royal crest branded on her thigh so that her identity could never be questioned. Later, he bequeathed Neamh \u00c1lainn to her firstborn child.\u201d She leaned forward and whispered, \u201c \u2019Tis said, he did so so that she would be sure to secure a good marriage since she was a bastard born child and her mother was baseborn.\u201d</p><p>Alaric snorted. \u201c \u2019Tis a well-known fact that Alexander never sired a daughter. He had no legitimate children and only one bastard son. Malcolm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did sire a daughter. A daughter named Mairin Stuart. And she\u2019s just above stairs in her chamber,\u201d Maddie insisted. \u201cI\u2019m telling you I saw the mark. I am not mistaken in this.\u201d</p><p>Ewan remained silent as he mulled Maddie\u2019s remarks and those of his brothers. He wasn\u2019t entirely sure he believed any of this nonsense, but it would certainly explain why Duncan Cameron was so determined to marry the lass, and it would also explain why she was desperate to escape.</p><p>\u201cWhy not just acknowledge the lass?\u201d Alaric argued. \u201cA bastard of the king would have no trouble securing a sound marriage. Any number of men would line up, if for no other reason than to seek favor with the crown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t want anyone to know,\u201d Maddie said. \u201cI can remember some years ago hearing the whispers that circulated. Alexander waited a full five years before making his bequest to the lass. He valued his marriage to Sybilla, and Malcolm was born before their marriage. It isn\u2019t known how he explained the bequest, but soon after his death, rumors began going around about the existence of the lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Malcolm still imprisoned, the existence of another descendent of Alexander could brew support for Malcolm\u2019s followers,\u201d Ewan said thoughtfully. \u201cIt could, in fact, be a large reason for Cameron\u2019s determination to wed her. Taking over her inheritance would give him more power than he currently wields. Much more power. Scotland could be at war again, and David would face a renewed threat. With Alexander having sired not one, but two possible contenders to the throne, David\u2019s position would be weakened. He can\u2019t afford another lengthy war that will only divide Scotland once again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bastard cannot inherit,\u201d Caelen reminded him. \u201cThis would never be accepted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink, Caelen. If Duncan Cameron had control of Neamh \u00c1lainn, he would be unstoppable. It would matter not the circumstances of Alexander\u2019s children\u2019s births. With that kind of wealth and power, if Cameron chose to ally himself with Malcolm, either could seize power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying you believe this rubbish?\u201d Alaric asked in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying anything. Yet,\u201d Ewan said calmly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see, Laird?\u201d Maddie burst in, excitement bubbling into her voice. \u201cShe\u2019s the answer to our prayers. If you marry the lass, then your heir would inherit Neamh \u00c1lainn. \u2019Tis said she brings a rich dowry to her marriage in addition to the bequest of the lands for her firstborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarry her?\u201d</p><p>The question was all but shouted by all three brothers. Ewan\u2019s mouth gaped open, and he stared at Maddie in astonishment.</p><p>Maddie nodded emphatically. \u201cYou have to admit, \u2019tis a sound plan. If you marry her, Duncan Cameron very well can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is that,\u201d Caelen pointed out.</p><p>Alaric turned to Caelen, his expression questioning. \u201cNow you\u2019re going along with this madness?\u201d</p><p>Ewan held up his hand to silence them. The throbbing in his head had escalated to a full-blown ache. He leveled a stare at Maddie, who had been listening to everything with rapt attention.</p><p>\u201cYou may go now, Maddie. I fully expect that everything that has been said here will remain strictly confidential. If gossip gets about the keep, I\u2019ll know where it originated.\u201d</p><p>Maddie rose and dropped a curtsy. \u201cOf course, Laird.\u201d</p><p>She hurried off and then Ewan turned to his brothers.</p><p>\u201cTell me you aren\u2019t considering this madness,\u201d Alaric cut in before Ewan could get a word out.</p><p>\u201cWhat madness do you think I\u2019m considering?\u201d Ewan asked mildly.</p><p>\u201cMarriage. Believing that the lass is the bastard daughter of Alexander, which makes her the niece of our current king. Not to mention half sister of the man who spent ten years trying to usurp David from the throne. And would do so again given the least opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I believe is that the lass and I are due for a long conversation. I intend to see this mark for myself. Given the relationship between our father and Alexander, I\u2019ve seen his royal seal on more than one occasion. I\u2019d know if the mark on her leg is the true one.\u201d</p><p>Caelen snorted. \u201cAnd you think she\u2019s going to lift her skirts for you to see this brand? She\u2019s more likely to knee you in the testicles for the offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be persuasive when the situation calls for it,\u201d Ewan drawled.</p><p>\u201cThis, I\u2019d love to see,\u201d Alaric said.</p><p>Ewan raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019ll see nothing of the sort. If I catch you even looking like you want a glimpse under Mairin Stuart\u2019s skirts, I\u2019ll pin you to the wall with my broadsword.\u201d</p><p>Alaric raised his hands in defense. \u201cForget I said anything. You\u2019re awfully touchy about a lass you claim annoys you to no end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the lass is who Maddie says she is, I aim to marry her,\u201d Ewan said grimly. \u201cOur clan needs the coin her dowry would provide.\u201d</p><p>Simultaneously, his brothers\u2019 mouths dropped. Caelen cursed loudly and Alaric shook his head and sent his eyes heavenward.</p><p>\u201cThink about what you\u2019re saying,\u201d Caelen said.</p><p>\u201cI believe I\u2019m the only one who is thinking,\u201d Ewan returned. \u201cIf \u2019tis true that her firstborn inherits Neamh \u00c1lainn, think about what this would mean for our clan. We would control the choicest lands in the whole of Scotland. No longer would we sit here dreaming about the day we take our revenge on Duncan Cameron. We would decimate him and his name. He would be obliterated from history. Our name would be avenged. The McCabe clan would be second only to the king. No one, and I mean no one, would ever have the power to destroy us as Dunca Cameron nearly did eight years ago.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His fist came down on the table, and his entire body trembled with rage.</p><p>\u201cI made a vow on our father\u2019s grave that I would not rest until our clan was restored to its full glory and that I would make Duncan Cameron pay for his crimes against us.\u201d</p><p>Caelen\u2019s face went cold, and Ewan could see the pain flare to light in his brother\u2019s eyes. But he nodded, his lips set into a fine line. \u201cIn this we agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeamh \u00c1lainn lies to the north with only McDonald between us. If we form a strong alliance with him, we would control a vast portion of this region.\u201d</p> <p>Excitement stirred in Ewan\u2019s veins as the plans of the last eight years came to life in his mind. Finally he saw a way to fulfill his vow to his father.</p><p>\u201cThe lass is courageous and she\u2019s fiercely protective of Crispen. She\u2019d make him a fine mother, as well as the rest of the sons she\u2019d bear me. In return, I\u2019d give her my protection, and she\u2019d never have to worry about Duncan Cameron again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t us you have to convince,\u201d Alaric said with a twist of his lips. \u201c \u2019Tis the lass you have to persuade. Caelen and I stand beside you always. You well know that. My loyalty is to you. Always. It extends to the woman you marry, no matter who she may be. She is a very courageous lass. I saw that for myself. And if she brings with her a dowry like Neamh \u00c1lainn, then I see no downside in marrying her.\u201d</p><p>Caelen nodded, but he said nothing about Mairin. Ewan didn\u2019t expect him to. It would surprise Ewan greatly if Caelen ever allowed himself to trust another woman again. If he ever sought to breed sons, Ewan felt pity for the woman Caelen would marry. Once, Caelen had given himself unreservedly. The folly of youth. He\u2019d vowed never to do so again.</p><p>Ewan put his hands down on the table and pushed himself to his feet. \u201cIt would appear I have much to discuss with Mairin Stuart. Alaric, I want you to send out an escort for Father McElroy. He\u2019s up at the McDonalds\u2019 administering last rites to one of their sick. I\u2019ll need him here to perform the wedding. If the lass is who Maddie says she is, I don\u2019t want to delay. We\u2019ll marry immediately.\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>Ewan stopped outside Mairin\u2019s chamber and smiled at the proximity to his own private quarters. She probably wouldn\u2019t be pleased if she knew how close he\u2019d placed her. He knocked to be polite, but he didn\u2019t wait for her answering summons before opening the door and entering the chamber.</p><p>Mairin whirled from her position at the window, her unbound hair flying about her shoulders. The furs were pulled aside to allow the sun to shine in, and she posed an enchanting portrait with the light reflecting the brilliant hue of her eyes.</p><p>Aye, she was indeed a bonnie lass, and it would be no hardship to marry her and get her with child. In fact, now that he\u2019d decided on a course of action, he looked forward to the prospect of Mairin in his bed.</p><p>She looked indignant over his intrusion, but before she could launch the reprimand he was sure was forthcoming, he held up a hand. The lass had no respect for his authority over her, but that was a matter that would quickly change. When she was his wife, he\u2019d take great delight in advising her of her duty to him and, most important, her obligation to obey him without question.</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me now what it is I want to know?\u201d he asked. To be fair\u2014and he was a fair man\u2014he wanted to give her the opportunity to confide her identity before he related his own knowledge.</p> <p>She thrust her chin upward in the show of defiance he now expected from her and shook her head. \u201cNay. I will not. You cannot order me to trust you. Why that\u2019s the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>He sensed she was warming up for a full-length diatribe, so he did the one thing he knew would silence her.</p><p>He rapidly closed the distance between them, curled his hands around her upper arms, and hauled her upward. His lips found hers in a heated rush, her gasp of outrage swallowed up by his mouth.</p><p>She went rigid against him, her hands shoving between them in an attempt to push him away. He brushed his tongue over her lips, tasting her sweetness, demanding entrance into her mouth.</p><p>Her second gasp came out more as a sigh. Her lips parted and she melted into his chest like warm honey. She was soft all over, and she fit him like his sword fit his hand. Perfectly.</p><p>He pushed inward, sliding his tongue over hers. She went rigid again, and her fingers curled into his chest like tiny daggers. He closed his eyes and imagined them digging into his back as he thrust between her thighs.</p><p>Lord, but she was sweet. Nay, bedding her would be no hardship at all. The image of her swollen with his child flickered through his mind, and he found himself very pleased with the image. Very pleased indeed.</p><p>When he finally pulled away, her eyes were glazed, her lips deliciously swollen, and she swayed like a sapling in the wind.</p> <p>She blinked several times and then frowned sharply. \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the only way to silence you.\u201d</p><p>She bristled with outrage. \u201cSilence me? You took liberties with my ... my ... my lips in order to silence me? That was very impertinent of you, Laird. I won\u2019t allow you to do it again.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and folded his arms over his chest. \u201cAye, you will.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth gaped open in astonishment and then worked up and down as she struggled to speak. \u201cI assure you I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assure you that ill.\u201d</p><p>She stamped her foot, and he stifled his laughter at the fury in her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone daft! Is this some trick? An attempt to seduce me into telling you who I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, Mairin Stuart.\u201d</p><p>She recoiled in shock. If he had any doubts about the validity of Maddie\u2019s claims, he didn\u2019t now. Mairin\u2019s reaction was too genuine. She was utterly horrified that he knew the truth.</p><p>She quickly came to the same realization that she\u2019d given herself away, because she didn\u2019t attempt to deny it. Tears welled in her eyes and she turned away, her fist going to her mouth.</p><p>An uncomfortable sensation knotted his chest. The sight of her distress unsettled him. The lass had suffered enough, and now she looked as though she was utterly defeated. The light had vanished from her eyes the moment he\u2019d uttered her name.</p><p>\u201cMairin,\u201d he began and gently touched her shoulder. She trembled underneath his touch, and he realized she shook with quiet sobs. \u201cLass, don\u2019t cry. \u2019Tis not as bad as that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay?\u201d She sniffed and shrugged away from his hand, moving closer to the window again. She bowed her head and her hair fell over her face, obscuring it from his view.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t any good with tears. They discomfited him. He was much more comfortable when he was inciting her anger. So he did the one thing he knew would infuriate her. He ordered her to stop crying.</p><p>As predicted, she turned on him, spitting like a cornered kitten.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cry if I want to. You will cease ordering me about!\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou dare to issue me orders?\u201d</p><p>She flushed, but at least she wasn\u2019t crying any longer.</p><p>\u201cNow tell me about this brand on your thigh. Your father\u2019s crest. I\u2019d like to see it.\u201d</p><p>She went crimson and she backed up a step until her back met with the ledge of the window. \u201cI will not do something so indecent as to show you my leg!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we\u2019re married, I\u2019ll see more than that,\u201d he said mildly.</p><p>\u201cMarried? Married? I\u2019m not marrying you, Laird. I\u2019m not marrying anyone. Not yet anyway.\u201d</p><p>It was the yet that intrigued Ewan. Clearly the lass hadn\u2019t totally discounted the notion of marriage, and she seemed levelheaded enough, so she had to realize the importance of marrying. She could hardly bear an heir to Neamh \u00c1lainn if she never married.</p><p>He sat on the bed and stretched his legs outward. This might take awhile, and he might as well be comfortable.</p><p>\u201cTell me why not yet. Surely youve given thought to marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019ve given it thought. I\u2019ve thought about little else over the years,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cHave you any idea how the last ten years have been for me? Living in fear, having to hide from men who\u2019d force me to their will so that they\u2019d gain from their marriage to me. Men who would plant their seed in my belly and discard me the moment I gave birth.</p><p>\u201cI was but a child when I was forced into hiding. A child. I needed time to formulate a plan. Mother Serenity suggested I find a man, a warrior, with the strength to protect my heritage, but also a man with honor. Someone who would treat me well,\u201d she whispered. \u201cA man who would cherish the gift I would bring to our marriage. And me.\u201d</p><p>He was struck by the vulnerability in her voice. The dreams of a young woman sounded strong in the tale she spun. It wasn\u2019t practical, but when he looked at her, he understood that she\u2019d been desperate and afraid, and she\u2019d clung to the hope of finding such a man among all the ones who\u2019d do just as she said. Marry her, impregnate her, and discard her when she no longer served a purpose.</p><p>He sighed. She wanted to be loved and cherished. He couldn\u2019t offer her those things, but he could offer her his protection and his regard. It was far more than Duncan Cameron would give her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never hurt you, lass. You\u2019ll have the respect due you as wife to the laird of the McCabe clan. I\u2019ll protect you and any child you bear me. You wanted a man who had the strength to defend your legacy. I\u2019m that man.\u201d</p><p>She turned wounded eyes on him, skepticism bright in her gaze. \u201cNot to offer insult, Laird, but your keep is crumbling around your ears. If you can\u2019t defend your own, how can you expect to defend a holding such as Neamh \u00c1lainn?\u201d</p><p>He stiffened at the insult, intended or not.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot be angry over such an observation,\u201d she rushed to say. \u201c \u2019Tis my right to question the qualifications of the man I would marry and in whose hands I would place my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have spent the last eight years fortifying my troops. There is not a larger, better-trained force in all of Scotland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that is correct, why then does your keep look as if it has sustained crippling damage in a battle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt did,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cEight years ago. Since then my focus has been on keeping my clan fed and my men trained. Repairs to the keep have been a much lower priority.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had not desired to marry anyone yet,\u201d she said in a mournful voice.</p><p>\u201cAye, I can understand that. But it seems you no longer have a choice. You\u2019ve been discovered, lass. If you think Duncan Cameron will give up when a holding such as Neamh \u00c1lainn is at stake, you\u2019re daft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be insulting,\u201d she snapped. C;I\u2019m not daft.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, growing impatient with the direction of the conversation. \u201cThe way I see it, you have two choices. Duncan Cameron. Or me.\u201d</p><p>She paled and twisted her hands in agitation.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should give it some thought. The priest should arrive within two days. I\u2019ll expect an answer by then.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the dazed look in her eyes, he turned and walked from the chamber. He paused at the door and turned to pin her with a stare.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think to try to escape again. You\u2019ll find I have no patience for chasing disobedient lasses all over my lands.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>Marry the laird. Mairin paced the interior of her chamber until she thought she might go mad. She stopped at the window and stared out, inhaling the soothing spring air. It was a warm afternoon with only a gentle bite of a chill.</p><p>Making a decision, she gathered her shawl and hurried from the room. No sooner had she stepped from the keep than one of the McCabe warriors fell into step beside her. She peeked cautiously up at him and remembered that he\u2019d been one of the men with Alaric the day they\u2019d found her and Crispen. She searched her memory for his name, but the whole event had been one big blur to her.</p><p>She smiled, thinking he only wanted to offer her greeting, but he continued in step with her as she rounded the corner of the keep and headed in the direction of the hole in the skirt.</p><p>Before she could lift her dress hem and climb over the crumbling rock face, the soldier gallantly took her hand and assisted her over the side.</p><p>She stopped and he nearly bumped into her, so close was he following behind. She whirled around and tilted her neck so she could look him in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaird\u2019s orders, my lady. \u2019Tis unsafe for you to walk about the keep unescorted. I am charged with your protection when the laird himself is not with you.\u201d</p><p>She snorted and put one hand on her hip. \u201cHe fears me escaping again and you\u2019ve been put to the task of making sure that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>The soldier didn\u2019t so much as blink.</p><p>\u201cI have no intention of leaving the keep. The laird has informed me of the consequences of such an action. I\u2019m merely out for a walk and a bit of fresh air, so there\u2019s no reason for you to leave your other duties to escort me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy only duty is to your safety,\u201d he said solemnly.</p><p>She gave a disgruntled sigh. She was sure the laird\u2019s men wereevery bit as thickheaded and stubborn as he was. It was probably a requirement.</p><p>\u201cVery well. By what name are you called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGannon, my lady.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me, Gannon, are you my permanent watch guard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI share the duty with Cormac and Diormid. Next to his brothers, we are the laird\u2019s most senior men.\u201d</p><p>She picked her way over the stones protruding from the ground as she made her way up the hillside toward the grazing sheep.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that\u2019s a duty any of you would welcome,\u201d she said wryly.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis an honor,\u201d Gannon said gravely. \u201cThe laird\u2019s confidence is great. He wouldn\u2019t entrust the safety of the mistress of the keep to just any of his soldiers.\u201d</p> <p>She stopped and whirled around, clamping her lips shut to prevent the shriek from escaping. \u201cI am not the mistress of this keep!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be in two days\u2019 time, just as soon as the priest arrives.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and shook her head. She\u2019d never been a drinker of spirits, but right now an entire tub of ale would be welcome.</p><p>\u201cThe laird does you a great honor,\u201d Gannon said, as if sensing her disquiet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking \u2019tis the other way around,\u201d Mairin muttered.</p><p>\u201cMairin! Mairin!\u201d</p> <p>She turned to see Crispen running up the hill as fast as his legs would carry him. He shouted her name the entire way and nearly knocked her off her feet when he crashed into her. Only Gannon\u2019s steadying hand prevented her fall.</p><p>\u201cCareful, lad,\u201d Gannon said with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019ll knock the lass over if you aren\u2019t careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMairin, is it true? Is it true?\u201d</p><p>Crispen positively wiggled in his excitement. His eyes shone like twin stars and he clutched at her arms, alternately hugging and squeezing her.</p><p>She grasped his shoulders and carefully pried him away from her. \u201cIs what true, Crispen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re marrying Papa? You\u2019ll be my mother?\u201d</p><p>Anger descended with breathtaking speed. How could he? How could the laird do this to Crispen? It would break his heart if she denied it. The laird\u2019s manipulation shocked her. She\u2019d thought him more honorable than that. Arrogant, aye. Even determined and focused. But she hadn\u2019t imagined him acting so deceitful and stirring the emotions of a young child.</p><p>Furious, she rounded on Gannon. \u201cTake me to the laird.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut, my lady, he\u2019s with the men. He\u2019s never to be disturbed during training unless \u2019tis a matter of great urgency.\u201d</p><p>She advanced on him, thrusting her finger into his chest. She accentuated her words by poking him. He was forced to take a step backward, his gaze wary.</p><p>\u201cYou will take me to him at once or I\u2019ll turn this entire keep upside down to find him. Believe me when I say, this is a matter of life and death. His life and death!\u201d</p><p>When she saw the determined denial in Gannon\u2019s eyes, she threw up her hands, let out a huge sigh of exasperation, and turned to head down the hill. She\u2019d find the laird herself. If he was training with his men, it meant he was in the courtyard where such training took place.</p><p>Remembering Crispen, and that she had no wish for him to hear what it was she had to say to the laird, she turned and pointed her finger sharply at Gannon.</p><p>\u201cYou keep Crispen with you. Do you hear?\u201d</p><p>His mouth gaped open at her command, and he stared alternately at her and at Crispen as if unsure what to do. He finally bent down, said something to Crispen, then pushed him in the direction of the sheep herder.</p><p>Mairin turned and stomped down the hill, angrier with each step. She nearly tripped over a rock and fell flat on her face, but Gannon caught her elbow.</p><p>\u201cSlow down, my lady. You\u2019re going to injure yourself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot myself,\u201d she muttered. \u201cYour laird, more likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon? I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t hear you.\u201d</p><p>She bared her teeth and shrugged out of his grasp. She blazed around the corner of the keep and into the courtyard. The heavy clang of swords, mixed swear words, and the smell of sweat and blood rose sharp in her ears and nose. She surveyed the mass of training men until she finally found the source of her fury.</p><p>Before Gannon could stop her, she waded into the fray, her gaze focused solely on the laird. Around her, shouts went up. She thought one man fell as she passed, but she couldn\u2019t be sure because she didn\u2019t pause in her quest.</p><p>Halfway there, the laird stopped his activity and turned to stare. When he saw her, his brow creased and he scowled. Not just his usual show of displeasure. He was furious. Well, that was fine, because so was she.</p><p>Only when she stopped barely a foot in front of the laird did Gannon catch up to her. He was out of breath and looking at the laird like he feared for his life.</p><p>\u201cYour pardon, Laird. I couldn\u2019t stop her. She was determined\u2014\u201d</p><p>The laird\u2019s angry gaze found Gannon and he arched an eyebrow in blatant disbelief. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t stop one slip of a lass from marching across a courtyard where any one of my men could have killed her?\u201d</p><p>Mairin snorted in disbelief but when she turned so she could survey the men who were now all standing in silence, she swallowed. Each carried a weapon, and if she\u2019d stopped to think about it at the time, she\u2019d have realized that going around the perimeter would have been a much better idea.</p><p>They were all scowling at her, proving her theory that the laird demanded surliness and pigheadedness from his men.</p><p>Determined to show no remorse for her mistake, she turned back to the laird and pinned him with the full force of her glare. He might be angry, but she was far more so.</p><p>\u201cI have not given you an answer, Laird,\u201d she all but yelled. \u201cHow could you? How could you do something so ... so ... underhanded and dishonorable?\u201d</p><p>The scowl on his face morphed into an expression of complete astonishment. He gaped at her with such incredulity that she wondered if he\u2019d perhaps misunderstood. So she hastened to inform him of precisely what she was so furious about.</p><p>\u201cYou told your son that I was going to be his mother.\u201d She walked up to him, stabbing her finger into his chest. \u201cYou gave me two days. Until the priest arrived. Two days to make my decision, and yet you inform the entire keep that I\u2019m going to be the new mistress.\u201d By then, she was beating him solidly with her hand.</p><p>The laird glanced down at her fingers as if he were about to shoo an annoying insect. Then he looked back at her, his eyes so icy that she shivered.</p><p>\u201cAre you quite finished?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She took a step back, the initial rush of her fury subsiding. Now that she\u2019d vented her rage, the reality of what she\u2019d done slapped her full in the face.</p><p>He advanced, giving her no opportunity to put any distance between them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever, ever question my honor. If you were a man, you\u2019d already be dead. As it is, if you ever speak to me as you\u2019ve done just now, I can guarantee you that you will not like the consequences. You are on my lands, and my word here is the law. You are under my protection. You will obey me without question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bloody likely,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What did you say?\u201d He roared the question at her.</p><p>She glanced serenely up at him, a bland smile on her face. \u201cNothing, Laird. Nothing at all.\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed and she could see his hands twitching again like he\u2019d love nothing more than to throttle her. She was beginning to think it was an affliction of his. Did he go around wanting to choke the life out of everyone or was she special in that regard?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid \u2019tis an urge that is entirely original to you,\u201d the laird barked.</p><p>She clamped her mouth shut and closed her eyes. Mother Serenity had vowed one day Mairin would regret her propensity to blurt out her least little thought. Today just might be that day.</p><p>By now the scowls of his men had been replaced with looks of open amusement. She didn\u2019t appreciate being the source of that amusement so she gave them a scowl of her own. It only served to make them twitch more as they battled their mirth.</p><p>\u201cI will say this but once,\u201d the laird said in a menacing voice. \u201cI have spoken of our prospective marriage to no one save the men I sent to escort Father McElroy back to my lands and those I charged with your protection. I would give the priest a reason for ushering him here with such haste. You, however, have now broadcast our impending nuptials to my entire clan.\u201d</p><p>She glanced uneasily around to see that quite a crowd had gathered. They stared upon her and the laird with undisguised interest. Indeed, they were hanging on every word.</p><p>She pinched her lips into a bow and stared unflinchingly up at the laird, who was still bristling with outrage.</p><p>\u201cThen how does your son know? And why do I have an escort who informs me his duty is to see to the mistress of the keep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you accusing me of speaking an untruth?\u201d</p><p>His voice was deathly quiet, so low that no one save her could hear, but the tone sent a surge of fear straight to her toes.</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d she said hastily. \u201cI would merely like to know how so many people know of a marriage that may or may not take place if you\u2019ve told no one.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cFirst, the marriage will take place. Just as soon as you\u2019ve regained your senses and realize that \u2019tis the only sensible option left to you.\u201d</p><p>When she would have opened her mouth to dispute his assertion, he shocked her by clamping his hand over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou will be silent and allow me to finish. I have doubts that you\u2019ve ever been able to hold your silence for more than a moment in your entire lifetime,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>She huffed but his hand tightened on her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI can only assume that my son overheard me speaking to my men of our marriage. If you would have but cautioned him to hold his tongue, he would not have repeated it beyond his question to you. But now, you\u2019ve announced our marriage to the entire clan. Some might even consider it a proposal. In which case, I accept.\u201d</p><p>He finished with a grin and then stepped back, releasing his hold on her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhy ... you ...,\u201d she sputtered. She worked her mouth up and down but nothing would come out.</p><p>A cheer went up from the crowd assembled.</p><p>\u201cA wedding!\u201d</p><p>Congratulations were shouted. Sds were raised. Men beat on the backs of their shields with the hilts of their swords. Mairin winced from the noise level and stared helplessly up at the laird. He stared back, arms crossed over his chest, a satisfied smile carving his too-handsome face.</p><p>\u201cI did not ask you to marry me!\u201d</p><p>He was undaunted by her vehemence. \u201c \u2019Tis customary to seal a betrothal with a kiss.\u201d</p><p>Before she could tell him what she thought of that daft idea, he hauled her against him. She hit his chest and would have bounced off if he hadn\u2019t held her firmly in place.</p><p>\u201cOpen your mouth,\u201d he demanded in a husky voice that sounded oddly tender given his degree of anger.</p><p>Her lips parted and he slid his tongue sensuously over hers. Her senses scattered in the wind. For a moment she quite forgot everything but the fact that he was kissing her and he had his tongue inside her mouth. Again.</p><p>And he\u2019d just announced to his clan that they were marrying. Or maybe she had. Realizing that the longer he kissed her in front of God and everyone, the harder a time she\u2019d have denying his claim, she gave him a mighty shove and nearly fell on her behind. To her mortification, Gannon caught her and held her up while she swiped at her mouth with the back of her arm.</p><p>Oh, but the laird looked smug now. He had a satisfied grin on his face as he watched her and waited.</p><p>\u201cKiss? I won\u2019t kiss you. I want to hit you!\u201d</p><p>She spun around and fled. The laird\u2019s laughter followed her the entire way.</p><p>\u201cToo late, lass! I already kissed you.\u201d</p><p>Back in her chamber, which she should have never left, Mairin resumed her pacing in front of the window. The man was impossible. He would drive her daft inside a day. He was controlling, overbearing. Arrogant. Handsome. And he kissed like a dream.</p><p>She groaned and smacked a hand to her forehead. He didn\u2019t kiss like a dream. He did it all wrong anyway. She was quite certain Mother Serenity had never said anything about tongues when kissing. Mother Serenity had been quite descriptive in her talks with Mairin. She hadn\u2019t wanted her to go ignorant to her marriage bed, and above all things, Mairin would one day marry.</p><p>But tongues? Nay, Mother Serenity had nothing to say on the matter of tongues. Mairin would have remembered such a thing, surely.</p><p>Mairin had assumed that the first time the laird had kissed her it was an aberration. A mistake. After all, her mouth had been open. It stood to chance his tongue might slip inside if he, too, had his mouth open.</p><p>She frowned at the thought. Could Mother Serenity have been mistaken? Surely not. She was knowledgeable about all things. Mairin trusted her implicitly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But the second time? It was no coincidence, because this time he\u2019d commanded her to open her mouth, and like a simpleton, she\u2019d gaped her mouth open and let him slide height over hers.</p><p>Just the memory had her shivering. It was ...</p><p>It was undignified. That\u2019s what it was. And she\u2019d tell him so if he ever tried to do it again.</p><p>Feeling marginally better now that she had that matter squared away, she turned her thoughts to the pressing issue of marriage. Hers.</p> <p>It was true that the laird filled a lot of the criteria that she and Mother Serenity had come up with. He was undoubtedly strong. He seemed awfully possessive of those he considered under his protection. It was true he had a large army. One had only to look at the numbers in the courtyard and how hard they trained.</p><p>The marriage would be equally, if not more, beneficial to him. Aye, she\u2019d have his protection, and he had the might to defend a holding such as Neamh \u00c1lainn, but he gained wealth and land that was rivaled only by that of the king.</p><p>Did she trust him to hold such power?</p><p>She hadn\u2019t meant to impugn his honor. She\u2019d been angry, but she didn\u2019t really believe that he was a dishonorable man. If she did, she\u2019d be trying a lot harder to escape. Nay, she was giving serious consideration to his proposal. Or her proposal. Or whoever had issued it.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t come into contact with many men in her lifetime. Only at an early age before she\u2019d been taken to the abbey in the middle of the night and sequestered there for many years. But she remembered the fear and the absolute knowledge that her life would be immeasurably changed if she fell into the wrong hands.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t feel that fear with Ewan McCabe. Oh, she feared him, but she didn\u2019t fear mistreatment from him. He\u2019d had ample opportunity\u2014and desire\u2014to strangle her, and yet he\u2019d held his temper each time. Even when he wasn\u2019t convinced of her role in his son\u2019s abduction and rescue, he hadn\u2019t made a single move to harm her.</p><p>She was fast coming to the conclusion that he was all bluster.</p><p>The thought made her smile. The McCabe men did like to frown. But Alaric had stood with her even after muttering blasphemies against her and all women. Caelen ... well, so far they had a mutual agreement to avoid each other. Now he frightened her. He didn\u2019t much like her, and he didn\u2019t care if she realized that or not.</p><p>Was she insane for considering marriage to the laird?</p><p>She stood by the window and watched as shadows darkened the rolling hills that surrounded the keep. In the distance, dogs barked as they brought in the sheep. The purple hue of dusk had settled over the land. Low to the ground, light fog rose, covering the hills like a mother tucking in her child for the night.</p><p>This would be her life. Her husband. Her keep. Her clan. No longer would she fear that at any moment she\u2019d be found and forced to marry a brute of a man who cared naught for anything but the riches she\u2019d bring with the birth of an heir.</p> <p>She would have a life, one se\u2019d nearly given up hope of ever having, and she\u2019d have a family. Crispen. The laird. His brothers. His clan.</p><p>Oh, but the longing was fierce inside her.</p><p>She turned her eyes heavenward and whispered a fervent prayer. \u201cPlease, God. Let this be the right decision.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>The lass was submerged in a full tub of water, head thrown back, eyes closed, and an expression of sheer bliss curved the contours of her face.</p><p>Ewan watched from the door, silent so he didn\u2019t disturb her. He should make his presence known. But he didn\u2019t. He was enjoying the unimpeded view far too much.</p><p>Her hair was pinned atop her head, but loose tendrils drifted down the slim column of her neck, clinging damply to her skin. His gaze drifted along the lines of those strands. He was particularly fascinated by the ones that rested on the curves of her breasts.</p><p>Bonny breasts she had. As bonny as the rest of her. She was all soft curves and lines, pleasing to the eye. She shifted, and for a moment he thought he was caught, but she never opened her eyes. She arched just enough that the pink tips of her nipples lifted through the water.</p> <p>His mouth went dry. His cock went rigid and strained against his trews. He curled and uncurled his fingers, unsettled by the fierce reaction she stirred within him.</p><p>He was hard and aching. Want was fierce within him. There was nothing to prevent him from charging across the room, yanking her from the tub and laying her on the bed. She was his to take. From the moment she\u2019d set foot on his lands, she was his. Whether she married him or not.</p><p>Still, the perverse part of his nature wanted her to come to him. He wanted her to accept her fate and bind herself to him of her own accord. Aye, the taking was far more satisfying when the lass was willing. Not that he couldn\u2019t have her willing in a matter of seconds ...</p><p>A frightened gasp echoed across the room. He frowned as he stared into her open eyes. He didn\u2019t want the lass afraid of him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t stay afraid for long.</p><p>Sparking with outrage, she bolted to her feet. Water sloshed over the side of the wooden tub and sluiced down her body, accentuating each of those delectable curves he had just been admiring.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you!\u201d</p><p>She stood, trembling in the water, not a stitch of clothing to obstruct a complete view of her body. Ah, she was a delectable sight, spitting fury, her breasts thrust proudly out. Dark curls nestled at the apex of her legs, guarding the sweet mysteries that lay beneath.</p><p>And then, as if realizing she\u2019d given him a lot more to look at by bolting to her feet, she let out a squeak and promptly dropped back into the tub. Both arms covered her chest and she hunched forward, hiding as much of herself as possible.</p><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d she roared.</p><p>He blinked in surprise and then grinned his appreciation of her bellow. She might be a slip of a thing, and she looked deceptively harmless, but she was a force to be reckoned with. Just ask his men, who were all understandably wary around her now.</p><p>She ordered Gannon, Diormid, and Cormac around relentlessly. At the end of the day he was treated to a list of complaints about their duties to guard\u2014and placate\u2014their mistress. Cormac had the idea that she should take over the training of their troops. Ewan thought she had a vicious streak and that she was merely retaliating over the fact that they\u2019d been given the task of looking after her.</p><p>She was not above ordering around those who stumbled into her path either. And if questioned, she merely gave everyone that sweet, innocent smile and told them that according to their laird, she would soon be the mistress of the keep. Accordingly, it was their duty to take their instructions from her.</p><p>The problem was most of those instructions bordered on the absurd. She\u2019d run everyone ragged for the last two days, and Ewan was here to tell her to cease. Father McElroy was due at any moment. One, she would give him her answer, and two, she would stop making his men look like haggard women by the end of the day.</p><p>It was shameful for warriors to whine as much as his men.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already seen everything there is to see,\u201d Ewan drawled.</p><p>A blush worked over her cheeks and she glared her disapproval at him.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come in without knocking. \u2019Tisn\u2019t proper.\u201d</p><p>He lifted an eyebrow and continued to stare at her though he knew it discomfited her. The same demon that provoked her to drive his men to madness prompted him to give her a little of that back.</p><p>\u201cYou were sound asleep in the tub, lass. You weren\u2019t going to hear an army if it passed through.\u201d</p><p>She snorted and shook her head in denial. \u201cI never sleep in the tub. Why, I could drown. That would be stupid, and I am never stupid, Laird.\u201d</p><p>He grinned again but didn\u2019t argue the fact that she had been soundly asleep when he\u2019d entered the chamber. He cleared his throat and went on to the matter at hand.</p><p>\u201cWe need to speak, lass. \u2019Tis high time you give me an answer. The priest should be here at any moment. You\u2019ve done enough mischief. \u2019Tis a serious matter we\u2019ve to decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll not speak to you until I\u2019m out of the tub and dressed,\u201d she said with a sniff.</p><p>\u201cI could help you with the matter,\u201d he said, without so much as flinching.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very considerate ...\u201d She ght off as she became aware of what he\u2019d offered. Her eyes narrowed and she hugged her arms tighter around her legs. \u201cI won\u2019t budge until you leave this room.\u201d</p><p>He sighed more to stifle the laughter that threatened than to show exasperation. \u201cYou have but a moment before I return. I suggest you make haste. You\u2019ve kept me waiting long enough.\u201d</p><p>He could swear she growled as he turned to walk out the door. He grinned again. She was proving to be a worthy bride and mistress to the McCabe clan. He might have expected a woman in her circumstances to be a frightened mouse, but she was as fierce as one of his warriors. He was looking forward to peeling back the many diverse layers she\u2019d presented and getting to the woman underneath. The very beautiful, soft lass that he\u2019d already seen glistening and wet.</p><p>Lord, but she was beautiful. And damn if he wasn\u2019t eager to get her in front of the priest.</p><p>Mairin lunged from the tub and wrapped one of the furs tightly around her. Casting furtive glances over her shoulder, she stood in front of the fire as she hastened to dry herself enough that she could put her gown back on. It would be just like the laird to walk back in before she finished dressing.</p><p>Her hair still quite wet, she pulled her clothing on and then sat in front of the fire to dry and comb her hair. She shivered when the window fur fluttered against a particularly stiff burst of wind and the cooler air blew over her damp hair.</p><p>When the knock sounded, though she\u2019d expected the laird, she jumped and turned to see the door open to admit him. His eyes raked over her like hot coals, and suddenly she didn\u2019t feel a chill at all. In fact, it was decidedly warmer in her chamber now.</p><p>She stared silently, mouth dry, and, for the first time, without words. There was something different about him, and she wasn\u2019t sure what, or that she wanted to know. He studied her\u2014nay he wasn\u2019t studying her. He was devouring her with his eyes. Like he was a hungry wolf closing in on a kill.</p><p>She swallowed at the image that thought invoked, and she covered her neck with her hand as if to protect her from his teeth.</p><p>He didn\u2019t miss the gesture and amusement gleamed brightly in his eyes. \u201cWhy are you afraid of me now, lass? You\u2019ve shown no fear of me from the beginning. I can\u2019t imagine that I\u2019ve done anything now to change that.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis over,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>He cocked his head to the side and then he moved closer to her, settling his large frame on the small bench in front of the fire.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s over, lass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI\u2019ve run out of time. I was a fool for not being better prepared. I waited too long, \u2019tis God\u2019s truth. I should have selected a husband long before now, but it was so peaceful at the abbey. I was lured into a false sense of security. Mother Serenity and I always spoke of the future, but with each passing day, the future loomed ever nearer.\u201d</p><p>eight=\"0em\" width=\"1em\" align=\"justify\"&gt;He shook his head and she glanced down at him, puzzled by his refusal.</p><p>\u201cYou did just right, Mairin. You waited.\u201d</p><p>Confused, she wrinkled her nose and asked, \u201cWhat did I wait for, Laird?\u201d</p><p>He smiled then, and she saw the arrogance etched in every facet of his face. \u201cYou waited for me.\u201d</p><p>Oh, but the man knew how to ruin her mood. \u2019Twas the truth, she thought he did it apurpose. She sighed, for it did her little good to continue to deny his suit. She knew and he knew that she\u2019d marry him. There was no other choice. But he wanted the words, so she\u2019d give him the words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll marry you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes gleamed in triumph. She thought he\u2019d tease her some more, perhaps tell her it was high time she\u2019d come to her senses. But he did none of those things. He kissed her.</p><p>One moment he was a respectable distance away. The next he was so close that she was enveloped by his scent.</p><p>He took her chin and tipped it up so he could fit his mouth to hers. Warm\u2014nay, hot\u2014and getting hotter with each passing second, his lips moved over hers like velvet.</p><p>It was an impressive feat that he could kiss her and all her senses fled. For a man who was constantly reminding her to come to hers, he seemed to take great delight in making them flee again.</p><p>His tongue rasped across her lips, and when she kept them tightly closed, he turned light and coaxing. He teased the seam of her mouth, licking and then nibbling. This time he didn\u2019t order her to open her mouth, and despite her determination not to do so, she found herself sighing in utter bliss.</p><p>As soon as her lips parted, his tongue slipped inside, probing and stroking with delicate precision. Each caress incited a deep response, one that she was at a loss to explain. How could kissing make her breasts go tight and other parts of her body tingle and swell until she felt near pain?</p><p>He evoked a restless, cagey feeling that made her want to squirm right out of her skin. And when he raised his hands to slide them up her arms, she shivered, trembling all the way down to her toes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he pulled away, she was dazed and she stared at him in absolute confusion.</p><p>\u201cAh, lass, what you do to me,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She blinked rapidly as she attempted to gather herself. This was a time when she needed to be solemn and sage. Offer something about how their marriage would be strong and based on mutual respect.</p><p>But none of those things would form in her mind. Quite simply, his kisses reduced her to a blithering idiot.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t kiss the correct way,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>Mortified that this was all she could manage to say, she closed her eyes and prepared herself for his censure.</p><p>When she reopened them, all she saw was deep amusement. The man looked fair to laughing. Her eyes narrowed. It was obvious he needed instruction on the matter.</p><p>\u201cAnd what, pray tell, is the correct way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must keep your mouth closed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>She nodded to reinforce her statement. \u201cAye, there are no tongues involved in kissing. \u2019Tis undignified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndignified?\u201d</p><p>Again she nodded. This was going better than she imagined. He was taking her instructions quite well.</p><p>\u201cMother Serenity told me that kisses are for the cheek or the mouth, but only in very intimate situations. And they shouldn\u2019t last overlong. Just enough to convey the proper emotion. She never mentioned anything about a tongue. It can\u2019t be proper for you to kiss me and stick your tongue inside my mouth.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched in a suspicious manner. He even put a hand to his mouth and rubbed firmly for several moments before he lowered it and said, \u201cAnd your Mother Serenity is an authority on kissing, is she?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded vigorously. \u201cOh aye. She told me everything I needed to know for the eventuality of my marriage. She took her duty very seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should instruct me personally on this kissing matter,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could show me the way of it.\u201d</p><p>She frowned but then remembered this was the man she was taking as her husband. In that case, she supposed it was entirely proper, and even expected, that she should offer instruction in the matter of loving. It was very decent of him to be so understanding and to offer to correct the matter immediately. Why, they were going to get along quite well.</p><p>Feeling much better about her impending nuptials, she leaned forward and pursed her lips, prepared to show him the way of it.</p><p>As soon as her lips touched his, he grasped her shoulders and hauled her even closer.</p><p>She felt swallowed up. Consumed. Like he was absorbing her very essence.</p><p>And despite her stern lecture and patient instruction, he used his tongue.</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p> <p>\u201cWake up, my lady! \u2019Tis your wedding day.\u201d</p><p>Mairin pried open her eyes and groaned at the sight of the women crowding into her small chamber. She was exhausted. Her late-night escape attempts and the time spent pacing her chamber had caught up to her. After last night\u2019s conversation with the laird, she\u2019d fallen into a deep sleep.</p><p>One of the women threw aside the furs covering the window, and sunlight speared through Mairin\u2019s eyeballs with razor-sharp clarity.</p><p>Her moan was louder this time and it set off a titter of laughter through the room.</p><p>\u201cOur mistress doesn\u2019t sound excited to be marrying our laird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristina, is that you?\u201d Mairin grunted out.</p><p>\u201cAye, lady. \u2019Tis I. We\u2019re having hot water brought up for a bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bathed last evening,\u201d Mairin said. Perhaps it would gain her an extra hour of sleep.</p><p>\u201cOh, but a bath on your wedding morning is a must. We\u2019ll wash your hair and work sweet-smelling oils into your skin. Maddie makes them herself and they smell divine. The laird will be most appreciative.\u201d</p><p>The laird wasn\u2019t uppermost on her mind this morning. Sleep was.</p><p>Another giggle raced around the room, and Mairin realized that once again, she\u2019d given voice to her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ve brought you a gown to be married in,\u201d another of the women said.</p><p>Mairin looked over, trying to remember the name of the young woman who was beaming excitedly at her. Mary? Margaret?</p><p>\u201cFiona, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Mairin sighed. \u201cSorry. There are so many of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took no offense,\u201d Fiona said cheerfully. \u201cNow would you like to see the gown we\u2019ve fashioned for you?\u201d</p><p>Mairin shoved herself up to her elbow and stared through bleary eyes at the assembled women. \u201cGown? You sewed a gown? But I agreed to marry the laird only last evening.\u201d</p><p>Maddie didn\u2019t look the least bit apologetic. She smiled broadly at Mairin as they held up the gown for her to see. \u201cOh, we knew it was only a matter of time before he persuaded you, lass. Aren\u2019t you glad we began sewing? It took two solid days of round-the-clock sewing, but I think you\u2019ll be happy with the result.\u201d</p><p>Mairin stared at the beautiful creation in front of her. Tears crowded to the surface, and she blinked to keep them at bay. \u201c \u2019Tis beautiful.\u201d And it was. It was rich green brocade and velvet with gold-trimmed sleeves and hem. Around the bodice were intricately embroidered designs with gold threads that shone in the sunlight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything to rival it,\u201d she said.</p><p>The three women beamed back at her. Then Maddie went over to the bed and yanked the covers back. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to keep the laird waiting. The priest arrived at dawn this morning, and the laird is quite impatient to have the ceremony done.\u201d</p><p>For the next hour, the women washed, scrubbed, and rubbed Mairin from head to toe. By the time she was done with the bath and laid out on the bed for them to work in the scented oils, Mairin was perilously close to falling into unconsciousness.</p><p>They\u2019d washed and dried her hair and then brushed it until it crackled and shined. It fanned over her back, satiny fine. Mairin had to admit, the women knew how to make a woman feel her best on her wedding day.</p><p>\u201cAll done,\u201d Christina announced. \u201c \u2019Tis time for the dress and then you\u2019re off to your wedding.\u201d</p><p>Just then a knock sounded on the door and Gannon\u2019s voice boomed through the heavy wood.</p><p>\u201cThe laird wants to know how much longer.\u201d</p><p>Maddie rolled her eyes and then went to yank open the door, though she kept her body between Gannon and the inside of the room so he wouldn\u2019t look on Mairin\u2019s nakedness.</p><p>\u201cYou tell the laird we\u2019ll have her down as soon as we can. These things can\u2019t be rushed! Would you have the lass not looking her best on her wedding day?\u201d</p><p>Gannon muttered an apology and then backed away, promising he\u2019d relay the news to the laird.</p><p>\u201cNow then,\u201d Maddie said as she returned to Mairin. \u201cLet\u2019s get this gown on you and then downstairs to the laird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been at it for hours,\u201d Ewan muttered. \u201cWhat could possibly take so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re women,\u201d Alaric said, as if that explained everything.</p><p>Caelen nodded and turned up his mug to drain the last of his ale.</p><p>Ewan sat in his high-backed chair and shook his head. His wedding day. There was a marked difference in this day and the day he\u2019d wed his first wife.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought of Celia except in passing for quite some time now. Some days he had difficulty conjuring the image of his young wife to mind. The years had passed, and with each year, she\u2019d faded more from his memory.</p><p>He\u2019d been a much younger man when he\u2019d wed Celia. She, too, had been young. Vibrant. He remembered that much. She always had a ready smile. He\u2019d considered her a friend. They\u2019d been childhood playmates before training had become his life. Years later, their fathers had seen fit to ally themselves and marriage between the clans made sense.</p><p>She\u2019d borne him a child in their second year of marriage. By the time the third year rolled around, she was dead, his keep was in ruins, and his clan nearly decimated.</p><p>Aye, their wedding day had been a joyous occasion. They\u2019d feasted and celebrated for three days. Her face had been alight with joy, and she\u2019d ed the entire time.</p><p>Would Mairin smile? Or would she come to their marriage with those same wounded eyes she\u2019d had when she arrived?</p><p>\u201cWhere is she, Papa?\u201d Crispen whispered beside him. \u201cDo you think she changed her mind?\u201d</p><p>Ewan turned to smile at his son. He stroked his hand over the lad\u2019s hair in a reassuring manner. \u201cShe\u2019s just getting dressed, son. She\u2019ll be here. She gave her word, and as you know, she puts great store in keeping her word. Women like to look their best on their wedding day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s beautiful already,\u201d Crispen protested.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Ewan said. And it was. The lass wasn\u2019t just beautiful, she was enchanting. \u201cBut they like to look extra special for just such occasions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she have flowers? She should have flowers.\u201d</p><p>Ewan almost laughed at the look of consternation on Crispen\u2019s face. His son was more nervous than he. Ewan wasn\u2019t nervous. Nay, he was just impatient and ready to have it done with.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have flowers?\u201d Crispen asked.</p><p>Ewan looked down at his son. Crispen looked so appalled that Ewan frowned.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give flowers any thoughts. But perhaps you\u2019re right. Why don\u2019t you go take up the matter with Cormac.\u201d</p><p>Across the room, Cormac had evidently been listening in on the conversation. He looked as appalled as Crispen had, and he hastily took a step back. But Crispen was too fast and was immediately in front of the man, demanding that they go collect flowers for Mairin.</p><p>He shot Ewan a disgruntled look as he allowed himself to be tugged from the great hall.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is taking them so long?\u201d Caelen demanded. He shifted restlessly in his chair and spread out his long legs as he slouched lower. \u201cThis is a waste of a good training day.\u201d</p><p>Ewan chuckled. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t consider my wedding day to be a waste of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Alaric said. \u201cWhile the rest of us are out sweating, you\u2019ll be enjoying a warm, sweet lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be sweating,\u201d Caelen said slyly. \u201cJust not in the way the rest of us are.\u201d</p><p>Ewan held up his hand to staunch the bawdy talk before it caught on with the rest of the men. The last thing he needed was his prospective bride to walk in and be embarrassed to her toes.</p><p>Just then Maddie burst in, her cheeks rosy and her chest heaving as she tried to catch her breath.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s coming, laird!\u201d</p><p>Ewan glanced over at the priest, who was enjoying a mug of ale, and motioned him up. As Mairin rounded the corner, the entire hall stood in acknowledgment of her presence.</p><p>Ewan was momentarily struck dumb. The lass wasn\u2019t just beautiful. She was utterly magnificent. Gone was the shy, somewhat awkward young woman and in her place was a lady with all the bearing of a descendent of royalty. She looked just like the princess she was.</p><p>She swept into the room, head held high, a look of serene calm on her face. Her hair was partially pulled into a knot just above her nape and the rest hung loose to her waist.</p><p>There was such a regal air about her presence, that Ewan suddenly felt unworthy.</p><p>Crispen burst into the room holding a wad of flowers so tightly that the stems were already limp and the flowers wilting as he flopped them about. He ran to Mairin and thrust them into her hands, petals scattering to the floor.</p><p>Her expression completely changed. Gone was the super-composed, cool woman. Her eyes warmed and she smiled tenderly down at his son. She leaned down to brush a kiss across his brow.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Crispen. They\u2019re absolutely beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Something twisted in the region of Ewan\u2019s heart.</p><p>He stepped forward until he was just behind Crispen. He reached down to frame his hands over his son\u2019s shoulders as he stared into Mairin\u2019s blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe priest is waiting, lass,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>She nodded then glanced down at Crispen. \u201cWill you come with us, Crispen? After all, you\u2019re very much a part of this ceremony.\u201d</p><p>Crispen puffed out his chest until Ewan thought he might burst. Then he slipped his hand into Mairin\u2019s. Ewan reached for the other, and she handed her flowers off to Maddie before sliding her fingers through his.</p><p>It felt right. Here was his family. His son and the woman who would be mother to him. He tugged her toward the waiting priest, as his two brothers came forward to flank Ewan and Mairin.</p><p>There in the protective hold of his family, he and Mairin exchanged their vows. She never wavered. Never gave any hint that she was anything but willing. She stared the priest in the eyes and then turned to look into Ewan\u2019s, as she recited her promise to honor and obey.</p><p>When the priest declared them married, Ewan leaned in to seal their troth with a kiss. She hesitated a mere moment and then whispered, \u201cYou will not use your tongue!\u201d</p><p>His laughter rang out over the hall. His clan looked eagerly for the source of his laughter, but he had eyes only for his new bride. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He found her lips, so sweet and warm, and took his time as he ravaged her mouth. And, oh aye, he used his tongue.</p><p>When he broke away, she glared ferociously up at him. He grinned and reached for her hand, pulling her against him as they turned to face his clan. Then he held her hand high in the air and presented her as the new mistress of the keep.</p><p>The roar of his clan echoed so loudly in the hall that Mairin winced. But she stood proudly beside Ewan, a delighted smile curving her lips.</p><p>One by one, his men came to kneel and offer their pledge to their new mistress. At first, Mairin looked baffled by the show of loyalty. She twitched as if she would have liked to disappear through the flooring.</p> <p>Ewan smiled as he watched her come to terms with her new position. She\u2019d led a sequestered life. Now, for the first time, she was stepping into her destiny.</p><p>When the last soldier bowed before Mairin, Ewan took her elbow to guide her toward the table where Gertie and the kitchen maids were busy setting out the trenchers for the wedding feast. In the corner, a small group of talented musicians gathered to play a set of lively tunes. After the feast there would be dancing and merriment until the bedding ceremony at sundown.</p><p>Ewan shared his place at the head of the table with Mairin. He wanted her seated beside him in a position of honor.</p><p>He called for a chair to be placed adjacent to his, and when the trenchers were laid and the first course served, he offered her the choicest bites from his serving.</p><p>Seemingly delighted by his regard, she allowed him to offer her tender bites of meat from his dagger. She smiled up at him so dazzlingly that for a moment he forgot to breathe. Shaken by the effect she had on him, he nearly knocked over the mug containing ale.</p> <p>Alaric and Caelen sat on either side of Ewan and Mairin. After the last of the people sitting at the main table had been served, Alaric rose from his seat and asked for silence. Then he held up his goblet and glanced down at Ewan and Mairin.</p><p>\u201cTo the laird and his lady!\u201d he called. \u201cMay their marriage be blessed with health and many sons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr daughters,\u201d Mairin muttered so low that Ewan almost didn\u2019t catch it.</p><p>His mouth twitched as he listened to the rest of his clan roar agreement. He raised his goblet and inclined his head in Alaric\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cAnd may our daughters all be as beautiful as their mother.\u201d</p><p>Mairin gasped softly and turned shining eyes on Ewan. Her smile lit up the entire room. To his utter shock, she suddenly bolted up, grabbed his face between her hands, and gave him a lusty kiss that curled his toes.</p> <p>The room erupted in a chorus of cheers. Even Caelen looked amused. When Mairin pulled away, Ewan was hard-pressed to remember his own name.</p><p>She scooted closer to him, pressing her soft curves to his side. His body reacted immediately. He was instantly hard, and his current position prevented him from shifting to alleviate the growing discomfort. If he adjusted, he would unseat Mairin, and he didn\u2019t want her to move away from him.</p><p>So he sat and grew more uncomfortable bupted inment.</p><p>Midway through the feast, the flute player began a particularly merry tune. It was lively and fast and dozens of feet began a rhythmic tapping on the floor. Mairin clapped her hands together and let out a sound of pure delight.</p><p>\u201cDo you dance, lass?\u201d Ewan asked.</p><p>She gave a wistful shake. \u201cNay, there was never dancing in the abbey. I\u2019m probably clumsy at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exceedingly graceful myself,\u201d Ewan said. \u201cWe\u2019ll muddle through it together.\u201d</p><p>She gifted him with another smile and impulsively squeezed his hand. He made a sudden vow that no matter how foolish he looked, he would dance with her as long as she wished it.</p> <p>\u201cLaird, Laird!\u201d</p><p>One of his watchmen ran into the hall, sword drawn. He searched Ewan out and immediately set out for the end of the table. Ewan rose, his hand automatically going to Mairin\u2019s shoulder in a protective gesture.</p><p>The soldier was out of breath when he came to a halting stop a mere foot from where Ewan stood. Alaric and Caelen shot up from their seats and waited for the news.</p><p>\u201cAn army approaches, Laird. I received word but a moment ago. They carry Duncan Cameron\u2019s banner. They come from the south and were two hours from our border at last report.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>Ewan cursed long and hard. Alaric\u2019s and Caelen\u2019s expressions grew stormy, but something else glimmered in their eyes. Anticipation.</p><p>Ewan found Mairin\u2019s hand again and gripped it so tight that she winced from the pain of it.</p><p>\u201cGather the troops. Assemble in the courtyard. Wait for me,\u201d Ewan commanded.</p><p>He started to drag Mairin from the table when Alaric called out. \u201cWhere in the hell are you going, Ewan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a marriage to consummate.\u201d</p><p>Openmouthed, Mairin found herself hauled toward the stairs. Ewan bounded up the steps, and she was forced to run to keep pace, or be dragged behind him.</p><p>He shoved her into his chamber and slammed the door behind him. She watched in befuddlement as he began stripping out of his clothing.</p><p>\u201cTake off your dress, lass,\u201d he said, as he tossed aside his tunic.</p><p>Completely bewildered, Mairin sagged onto the edge of the bed. He wanted her to undress? He was busy pulling his boots off, but it was her duty to undress him. He didn\u2019t have the right of it at all.</p><p>Thinking to instruct him on his error, she rose and hurried over to stay his progress. For a moment, he halted and stared at her as if she were daft.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis my duty to undress you, Laird. \u2019Tis the wife\u2019s duty,\u201d she corrected. \u201cWe\u2019re married now. I should undress you in our chambers.\u201d</p><p>Ewan\u2019s gaze softened and he reached out to cup her cheek. \u201cForgive me, lass. This time will be different. Duncan Cameron\u2019s army approaches. I don\u2019t have the time to woo you with sweet words and a soft touch.\u201d His forehead creased and he grimaced. \u201cIt will have to be a quick bedding.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him in confusion. Before she could question him further, he began tugging at the laces on her dress. When he didn\u2019t immediately have the bodice undone, he pulled impatiently.</p><p>\u201cLaird, what are you doing?\u201d she stammered out.</p><p>She gasped in surprise when the material ripped and fell over her shoulders. She tried to lift the dress back up, but Ewan pushed downward, leaving her in only her undergarments.</p><p>\u201cLaird,\u201d she began, but Ewan hushed her by taking her shoulders and pressing his lips to hers. As he maneuvered her to the bed, he managed to divest her of the rest of her clothing.</p><p>His trews hit the floor, and she felt something hot and hard brush against her belly. When she looked down and saw what it was, her mouth gaped open and she stared in horror at the jutting appendage.</p><p>He captured her chin and directed her gaze upward again. As his mouth covered hers, he lowered her to the bed until she lay on her back and he hovered just above her, his arm pushed into the bedding to prevent his full weight from bearing down on her.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs, Mairin,\u201d he rasped against her lips.</p><p>Confounded by the entire experience, she relaxed her thighs and then squeaked in dismay when Ewan\u2019s hand slipped between her legs and stroked his thumb through the delicate folds.</p><p>His mouth slipped down the side of her neck. Chill bumps raced over her shoulders and to her breasts as his lips fastened against the flesh just below her ear. It was oddly exciting and it stirred breathless feelings of ... she wasn\u2019t sure how to describe any of it. But she liked it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, lass.\u201d His voice was heavy with regret. \u201cI\u2019m so damned sorry.\u201d</p><p>She frowned as she gripped his shoulders. His body moved over hers, covering her with his heat and hardness. What was he sorry for? It didn\u2019t seem appropriate to offer apology in the middle of loving.</p><p>She felt him, hard as steel, as he probed between her thighs. It took a moment for her to realize what he was probing with. Her eyes flew open and her fingers dug into his skin.</p><p>\u201cEwan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He thrust forward, and the hazy euphoria she\u2019d experienced just moments before disappeared as pain tore her in half when he ripped through her body.</p><p>She cried out and pounded his shoulders with clenched fists. Tears slipped down her cheeks and he swept them away with his mouth as he rained kisses over her face.</p><p>\u201cShhh, lass,\u201d he crooned.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said again. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Mairin. But I can\u2019t stop. We must finish this.\u201d</p><p>He moved tentatively, and she hit him again. He\u2019d torn her in two. There was no other explanation for it.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t torn you apart,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cBe still a moment. The pain will go away.\u201d</p><p>He withdrew, and she flinched as her body tugged tightly at him. Then he pushed forward again, and she whimpered at the fullness.</p><p>A shout in the hallway made her go rigid. Ewan cursed and then began moving again. She lay there in shock, unable to process or put a name to the uncomfortable sensation that welled within.</p><p>Once, twice, and once again he pushed into her, and then he tensed against her and held himself so still that she could hear the violent thud of his heartbeat.</p><p>Just as suddenly, he rolled away, and she felt sticky wetness between her legs. Not having any idea what it was she was supposed to do next, she lay there trembling as her husband hurried to dress.</p><p>After he pulled on his boots, he returned to the bed and slipped his arms underneath her. Maybe now he would offer the tender words a husband was supposed to say after loving. But he simply picked her up and cradled her in his arms for a moment. Then he carried her to the bench in front of the fire and set her down.</p><p>She blinked and watched as he stripped the linen from the bed and examined the bloodstain in the middle. Curling it into his hand, he glanced over at her, his eyes brimming with apology.</p><p>\u201cI must go, lass. I\u2019ll send one of the women to tend you.\u201d</p><p>He left the chamber, shutting the door behind him, and Mairin stared after him in complete disbelief over what had just transpired.</p><p>A moment later, Maddie bustled in, sympathy burning bright in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThere, there, lass,\u201d Maddie said, as she gathered Mairin in her arms. \u201cYou look too pale, and your eyes are much too wide. I\u2019ll have hot water brought up to you. \u2019Twill soothe your aches and pains.\u201d</p><p>Mairin was too mortified to ask Maddie any of the questions swirling around her mind. She sat there, numb to her toes, while the battle cry rose from the courtyard and then the sound of hundreds of horses thundering across the land drowned out everything else.</p><p>Then her gaze flickered across the discarded dres on the floor. He\u2019d torn her dress. Her wedding dress. After every other bewildering thing that had occurred this day, the dress shouldn\u2019t have upset her so. But tears welled in her eyes, and before she could call them back, warm trails trickled down her cheeks.</p><p>Maddie left her to replace the linens on the bed. She bustled around the chamber, though it was clear she had no task to do.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered to Maddie. \u201cI just want to be alone.\u201d</p><p>Maddie eyed her dubiously, but when Mairin reinforced her request, Maddie reluctantly turned away and left the chamber. Mairin stayed on the bench for a long moment, her knees huddled to her chest as she stared into the dwindling fire. Then she got up to wash the stickiness from her body. When she was done, she crawled onto the bed and huddled underneath the clean linens, too tired and distraught to worry over Duncan Cameron\u2019s army.</p><p>Ewan led his men over the hilltops and down the steep southern boundary of their lands, his two brothers flanking him. Another rider had ridden furiously to give Ewan an update. Cameron\u2019s men were approaching without delay.</p><p>There would be no time to stage a surprise attack, and in truth, Ewan had no desire for one. He rode with the might of his entire army, save only a contingent that remained behind to guard the keep. There was no doubt they\u2019d be outnumbered, but the McCabe soldiers made up in might what they lacked in numbers.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just over the next hilltop, Laird,\u201d Gannon said as he drew up his horse in front of Ewan.</p><p>Ewan smiled. Revenge was at hand.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s greet Cameron on the next rise,\u201d Ewan said to his brothers.</p><p>Alaric and Caelen raised their swords into the air. Around them, the shouts of their men echoed sharply across the land. Ewan spurred his horse and they raced down the hill and began the climb to the next. When they topped the rise, Ewan called a halt as they stared down at the assembled might of the Cameron army.</p><p>Ewan scanned the Cameron soldiers until finally his gaze lighted on his prey. Duncan Cameron sat high in his saddle, dressed in full battle regalia.</p><p>\u201cCameron is mine,\u201d he shouted to his men. Then he glanced sideways at his brothers. \u201c \u2019Tis time to deliver a message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill them all?\u201d Alaric asked mildly.</p><p>Ewan\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cEvery last one.\u201d</p><p>Caelen rotated his sword in his hand. \u201cThen let it be done.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ewan gave the battle cry and urged his horse down the hill. Around him, his men took up the cry and soon the valley echoed with the thunder of horses. The McCabes descended like avenging hellfire, their savage cries enough to frighten the souls of the dead.</p><p>After a faltering hesitation, when it wasn\u2019t clear whether they meant to attack or run, Cameron\u2019s men surged forward. divmet in a clash of swords at the bottom of the hill. Ewan slashed through the first two men he encountered with a deft swing of his sword. He could see the surprise\u2014and the fear\u2014in the eyes of Cameron\u2019s men. They hadn\u2019t expected to encounter a fighting force such as Ewan\u2019s, and Ewan derived unholy satisfaction from that fact.</p><p>He glanced quickly to check on his men. He needn\u2019t have worried. Caelen and Alaric were cutting a swath through Cameron\u2019s men while the rest of his soldiers dispatched their foes with expert speed and agility.</p><p>Ewan set his sights on Cameron, who still hadn\u2019t dismounted his horse. He stood back, watching his men and barking orders. Ewan single-mindedly cut a path through Cameron\u2019s men until only two soldiers stood between him and Cameron.</p> <p>He dispatched the first with a slice through the man\u2019s chest. Blood gleamed crimson on his sword as he swung it around to meet the last obstacle to his goal. The soldier glanced warily at Ewan and then back at Cameron. He raised his sword as if to meet Ewan\u2019s advance, but at the last moment he turned and fled.</p><p>Ewan\u2019s lips curled into a satisfied smile at the sudden fear in Cameron\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cGet off your horse, Cameron. I\u2019d hate to spill the blood of a steed as fine as he.\u201d</p><p>Cameron raised his sword, gathered the reins in his other hand, and kicked his horse forward. He charged at Ewan, letting out a bloodcurdling cry.</p><p>Ewan deflected the blow and twisted his sword, lifting Cameron\u2019s right out of his hands. It went sailing through the air and landed with a sickening thud into one of the fallen bodies a short distance away.</p> <p>Ewan spun to meet the next charge, but Cameron never slowed. He spurred his horse to faster speeds and raced across the terrain. Away from his men and from the battle.</p><p>As Ewan turned to battle another foe, he snapped his teeth together in fury. Coward. Bloody coward. He\u2019d deserted his men and left them all to die while saving his own arse.</p><p>Ewan gave the order for his men to finish it, and he began working his way back toward his brothers. The Cameron soldiers were woefully outmatched.</p><p>The remaining commander of Cameron\u2019s ill-fated army evidently came to the same conclusion. He yelled retreat, and his men didn\u2019t just retreat. They fled.</p><p>The commander, unlike Cameron, wasn\u2019t a coward. He didn\u2019t flee. He urged his men to beat a hasty retreat and he fought valiantly at their rear, offering his protection\u2014as pathetic as it was\u2014so they could escape to safety.</p><p>Ewan signaled his men to give chase, and he turned his sights on the commander.</p> <p>When Ewan bore down on him, he saw the resignation on the older man\u2019s face. Ewan raised his sword and stalked forward. The commander took one step back, then brought his sword up, prepared to battle to the death.</p><p>Ewan swung his sword in a great arch and the blades met with a rounding clang. The older man was weakening. He already had a wound and he was losing blood. On Ewan\u2019s second strike, he knocked the sword from his opponent\u2019s hand and it hit the ground with a clatter.</p><p>Death stared back at Ewan from the depths of the man\u2019s eyes. The commander knew it and accepted it as only a warrior could. He sank to his knees and bowed his head in front of Ewan, in acknowledgment of defeat.</p><p>Ewan stared down at him, his throat working against the anger that swirled so fierce within him. Had this been what his father had done just before Cameron cut him down? Had his father fought to the bitter end? Or had he known, as this man knew, that defeat was inevitable?</p><p>For a long moment, Ewan held his sword above his head, and then he slowly lowered it and looked around at the dying battle. Cameron\u2019s men were scattered across the landscape. Some dead. Some dying. Some fleeing on foot, while others ran their horses into the ground to escape Ewan\u2019s soldiers.</p><p>He whistled for his horse, and the commander looked up, surprise glittering in the eyes that had just been shadowed by imminent death.</p><p>When Ewan\u2019s horse obediently stopped a mere foot away, Ewan reached back for the sheet bearing Mairin\u2019s virgin blood. He spread it out like a banner, the ends blowing in the wind. Then he wadded it into his hand and thrust it into the commander\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYou will take this back to Cameron,\u201d Ewan said through gritted teeth. \u201cAnd you will bear my message.\u201d</p> <p>The commander slowly took the linen and then nodded his acceptance of Ewan\u2019s dictate.</p><p>\u201cYou will tell Duncan Cameron that Mairin Stuart is now Mairin McCabe. She is my wife. The marriage has been consummated. Tell him that Neamh \u00c1lainn will never be his.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>By the time Ewan and his men rode back into the courtyard, it was well past midnight. They were dirty, bloody, tired, but jubilant over such an easy victory.</p><p>A celebration would ensue, but Ewan didn\u2019t feel like celebrating. Duncan Cameron had escaped Ewan\u2019s retribution and it burned like sour ale in his belly. He wanted the bastard on the end of his sword, now not only because of what he\u2019d done eight years before, but because of what he\u2019d done to Mairin.</p><p>He gave orders to his men to increase the watch. There was much to be done in light of his marriage to Mairin. The keep\u2019s defenses would have to be strengthened, and new alliances, such as one with the McDonalds, were more important than ever.</p><p>Even with all of that weighing down on him, his primary thought lay with Mairin. He regretted the haste in which he\u2019d bedded her. He didn\u2019t like guilt. Guilt was for men who made mistakes. Ewan didn\u2019t like the idea of making mistakes or admitting his failures. Aye, but he\u2019d failed the lass and he was at a loss as to how to make it to her.</p><p>He took the time to bathe in the loch with the other men. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that a sweet lass lay in his bed, he\u2019d have crawled beneath the covers in his boots and not worried over the mess until morning.</p><p>After washing the dirt and blood from his body, he quickly dried and mounted the steps to his chamber. Eagerness drove him. Not only did he want to show the lass a little tenderness, but he burned for her. Before, he\u2019d only tasted of her sweetness. Now he wanted to feast on it.</p><p>He quietly opened his chamber door and stepped inside. The room was cloaked in darkness. Only the coals from the fire gave light as he crossed to the bed. She was nestled in the middle of the bed, her hair spread out like a veil of silk. He slid one knee onto the bed and leaned over her, prepared to wake her, when he saw the lump on the other side of her.</p><p>Frowning, he peeled back the cover to see Crispen nestled in her arms, his head laying on her bosom. A smile eased his frown when he saw how she had both arms wrapped protectively around him. The lass had taken her role as Crispen\u2019s new mother very seriously. They were tucked in as tight as two kittens on a cold night.</p><p>With a sigh, he eased down beside her, resigning himself to the fact that he wouldn\u2019t awaken his wife with kisses or touches this night.</p><p>He moved in close until her back was cradled against his chest. Then he curled one arm around both her and Crispen, as he buried his face in Mairin\u2019s sweet-smelling hair.</p><p>It was the fastest he\u2019d ever fallen asleep in his life.</p><p>He was careful not to wake Mairin or Crispen when he rose just a few hours later. He dressed in the darkness and got his boot caught on something as he tried to walk toward the door. He reached down and picked up the offending material and realized it was Mairin\u2019s dress that she\u2019d worn when she wed him.</p><p>Remembering that he\u2019d torn it in his haste to bed her, he stared down at it for a long moment. The image of Mairin\u2019s wide, shocked eyes and the hurt reflected in them made him frown.</p><p>It was just a dress.</p><p>Curling it in his hand, he took it with him as he made his way below stairs. Even at the early hour, the keep was already stirring with activity. Caelen and Alaric were just finishing eating and looked up when Ewan entered the hall.</p><p>\u201cMarriage has turned you into a slugabed,\u201d Caelen drawled. \u201cWe\u2019ve both been up for an hour.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring his brother\u2019s jibe, Ewan took his seat at the head of the table. One of the serving women hurried out with a trencher of food and set it in front of Ewan.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you holding, Ewan?\u201d Alaric asked.</p><p>Ewan glanced down to see he was still carrying Mairin\u2019s dress tightly clenched in his hand. Instead of answering Alaric, he called the serving girl back.</p><p>\u201cIs Maddie about yet?\u201d&gt;</p><p>\u201cAye, Laird. Would you like me to fetch her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt once.\u201d</p><p>She dipped a curtsy and hurried out to do his bidding. Mere moments later, Maddie hurried in.</p><p>\u201cYou called for me, Laird?\u201d</p><p>Ewan nodded. \u201cAye.\u201d He thrust the dress toward the woman, and with a surprised look, she took it. \u201cCan you repair it?\u201d</p><p>Maddie turned the material over in her hands, examining the place where the material had rent.</p><p>\u201cAye, Laird. \u2019Twill only take a needle and thread. I could have it done in no time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee that you do. I\u2019d like for your mistress to have it whole again.\u201d</p><p>Maddie smiled, and her eyes sparkled with a knowing look that annoyed him. He scowled at her and motioned her away. Still grinning, she tucked the dress under her arm and left the hall.</p><p>\u201cYou tore her wedding dress?\u201d Caelen smirked.</p><p>\u201cYou certainly have a way with the wenches,\u201d Alaric said, shaking his head. \u201cYou haul her up the stairs for perhaps what was the fastest consummation on record, and you tear her wedding dress in the process.\u201d</p><p>Ewan\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cShe\u2019s not a wench. She\u2019s your sister now and you should speak of her with respect as your mistress and wife to your laird.\u201d</p><p>Alaric held up his hands in surrender and leaned back in his chair. \u201cNo offense was intended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouchy, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Caelen said.</p><p>Ewan\u2019s glare silenced his youngest brother. \u201cWe have much to do today. Alaric, I need you to be my emissary to McDonald.\u201d</p><p>Both Alaric and Caelen shot forward in their seats, incredulity etched on their faces.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Ewan, the bastard tried to abduct your son,\u201d Alaric growled.</p><p>\u201cHe denies knowledge of his soldier\u2019s actions and vows that his soldier acted on his own accord. The soldier is dead now,\u201d Ewan said flatly. \u201cHe won\u2019t be a threat to my son ever again. McDonald wants an alliance. \u2019Tis to his advantage to call us friend. I\u2019ve denied him until now. But his lands would join ours to Neamh \u00c1lainn. I want you to make it happen, Alaric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo be it,\u201d Alaric said. \u201cI\u2019ll leave within the hour.\u201d</p><p>Alaric strode from the hall to prepare for his journey. Ewan quickly finished his meal and then he and Caelen quit the hall and went to where his men were training.</p><p>They stood in the courtyard, watching as the other soldiers sparred and went through ttraining exercises.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis imperative that Mairin be under constant guard,\u201d Ewan said in a low voice to Caelen. \u201cDuncan Cameron won\u2019t give up just because I\u2019ve wed her. There is much to be done, and Mairin must remain inside the keep under careful watch.\u201d</p><p>Caelen shot Ewan a wary glance. \u201cDon\u2019t think to saddle me with such a chore. She\u2019s your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the future of our clan,\u201d Ewan said in a dangerously soft voice. \u201cYou would do well to bear that in mind when you tell me what you will and won\u2019t do. I expect your loyalty to me to extend to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut a nursemaid, Ewan?\u201d Caelen asked in a pained voice.</p><p>\u201cAll you have to do is keep her safe. How hard can that be?\u201d Ewan asked. He motioned to his senior commanders when they finished the current round of sparring.</p><p>He instructed Gannon, Cormac, and Diormid on his expectations that Mairin be watched over at all times.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, Laird. She won\u2019t like it much,\u201d Gannon said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not concerned with what she won\u2019t like,\u201d Ewan countered. \u201cMy concern is keeping her safe and with me.\u201d</p><p>The men nodded their agreement.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to alarm her. I don\u2019t want her to feel unsafe on my land. I want her guarded well but I want it to appear that \u2019tis just the way of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can count on us to keep Lady McCabe safe, Laird,\u201d Cormac vowed.</p><p>Satisfied that his men understood the importance of keeping close watch on Mairin, Ewan summoned his messenger and penned a missive to the king informing him of his marriage to Mairin and requesting the release of her dowry.</p><p>For the first time in many years, hope beat a steady rhythm in his chest. Not for vengeance. Nay, he\u2019d always known that the day would come when he would repay the wrongs done to his clan. With Mairin\u2019s dowry his clan would prosper once again. Food would be plentiful. Supplies would be on hand. They would cease eking out their existence under spartan conditions. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Despite Ewan\u2019s intention to spare a moment to speak with Mairin\u2014he wasn\u2019t entirely sure about what\u2014the day passed in a blur of activity. He\u2019d thought to gauge her mood and offer reassurance that Duncan Cameron\u2019s men had been dispatched. Aye, she\u2019d feel better and more secure, and she damn sure wouldn\u2019t doubt his ability to protect her or his keep any longer.</p><p>An incident with his men prevented Ewan from dining with Mairin, and by the time he trudged up the stairs to his chamber, he was tired, but at least he was clean after a dip in the loch.</p><p>He nudged the door open to see that she was already abed, her soft, even breathing signaling her slumber. He started forward, intent on waking her, when h saw that once again, Crispen was snuggled against her. He sighed. Tomorrow he would make it a point to tell her that Crispen was to sleep in his own chambers across the hall.</p><p>He never got the chance to make his point. From the moment Mairin awoke, he never seemed to gain the opportunity to speak with her. Toward afternoon, he grew impatient and issued a direct summons for her to appear before him.</p> <p>When it went unanswered, he sent Cormac to fetch her, since Diormid was guarding her. Cormac returned with the news that Mairin was visiting the cottages of the other women and would speak to her laird later.</p><p>Ewan scowled, and Cormac seemed uncomfortable telling his laird that his bride had refused him.</p><p>Clearly they were going to have to discuss matters far more important than where his son slept. Namely, the idea that she had the right to refuse a direct order from Ewan.</p><p>He made it a point to eat dinner with Mairin that evening. She looked tired and nervous. Her gaze kept darting toward him when she thought he wasn\u2019t looking, as though she feared him lunging across the table and hauling her to his chamber.</p><p>He sighed. He supposed it wasn\u2019t an unreasonable fear given what had occurred on their wedding day. Some of his irritation fell away. The lass was skittish. It was up to him to allay her fears and soothe her worries.</p> <p>Protection was something he could readily offer. His loyalty to the woman he called wife would be unwavering. She\u2019d never want for anything he could provide as long as he lived. Those were things that the warrior in him readily embraced. But things like tenderness and understanding? Sweet words meant to soothe away worries? The mere idea appalled him beyond measure.</p><p>His thoughts must have been expressed on his face because Mairin sent him a startled look and then she immediately rose and excused herself from the table. Without waiting for his permission to leave, she murmured something to Crispen. The lad stuffed his mouth full of food and hastily shoved away from the table. He took her hand and they left the hall in the direction of the stairs.</p><p>Ewan\u2019s eyes narrowed as he realized just what it was she was doing. She was purposely taking Crispen into their bed in an effort to avoid Ewan. If he weren\u2019t so annoyed, he might have been impressed by her craftiness.</p><p>He himself pushed away from the table and rose with a nod to Caelen. He\u2019d rather go off to war than go up those stairs and face a situation with his new wife that he had no inkling of how to resolve.</p><p>A good start would be to issue a stern lecture on obeying his orders. After that, he would simply command her to cease being so skittish around him.</p><p>Feeling confident about his plan of action, he went up to his chamber and opened the door. Mairin whipped around, surprise written in her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cIs there something you need, Laird?\u201d</p><p>He lifted an eyebrow. \u201cCan I not retire to my own chamber?\u201d</p><p>She flushed and gathered ng pen to her skirts. \u201cAye, of course. You don\u2019t usually come to bed so early. That is, I hadn\u2019t expected you to ...\u201d</p><p>She trailed off, her blush deepening. She pressed her lips firmly together as if refusing to say another word.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t resist teasing her. \u201cI hadn\u2019t realized you were so familiar with my sleep habits, lass.\u201d</p><p>Her blush disappeared and she glared her displeasure.</p><p>Determined to set her straight on several issues, he crooked his finger at Crispen, and when he grudgingly separated himself from Mairin and approached his father, Ewan put his hands on Crispen\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cTonight you\u2019ll sleep in your own chamber.\u201d</p> <p>When Mairin would have protested, he silenced her with a stern look. Crispen also wanted to argue, but he was too disciplined for that. Most of the time.</p><p>\u201cAye, Papa. May I kiss Mama good night?\u201d</p><p>Ewan smiled. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Crispen hurried back over to Mairin and allowed her to sweep him into a hug. She kissed the top of his head and then squeezed him tight. Crispen returned and stood solemnly in front of Ewan.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Papa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, son.\u201d</p><p>Ewan waited until his son had left the room before turning back to Mairin. Her chin went up and defiance sparked in her eyes. She was preparing for battle. The thought amused him but he smothered the smile that threatened. It was God\u2019s truth, he\u2019d smiled more since her arrival than he had in his life.</p><p>\u201cWhen I issue you a summons, I expect you to heed it,\u201d he said. \u201cI expect\u2014nay, I demand\u2014obedience. I won\u2019t accept defiance from you.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth took on a pinched look. At first he thought he\u2019d frightened her again, but on second look, he saw she was furious.</p><p>\u201cEven when your demands are ridiculous?\u201d she asked with a sniff.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow at that. \u201cMy asking you to present yourself to me is ridiculous? I had matters to discuss with you. My time is valuable.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth and then promptly shut it again. But she muttered something under her breath that he didn\u2019t catch.</p><p>\u201cNow that we have that matter resolved, while I appreciate your devotion to my son, he has his own chamber that he shares with other children of the keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should sleep with his mother and father,\u201d she blurted.</p><p>\u201cAye, there will be times when that is indeed the case,\u201d Ewan agreed. \u201cBut right after our marriage is not one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fail to see what being newly married has to do with it,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>He sighed and tried to rein in his impatience. The lass was going to be the death of him.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis hard to bed my wife if my son is sharing the bed with us,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>She looked away and twisted her hands in front of her. \u201cIf \u2019tis all the same to you, I\u2019d rather not have you ... bed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you plan to become pregnant, lass?\u201d</p><p>Her nose wrinkled and she cast him a cautious but hopeful look. \u201cPerhaps your seed has already taken root. We should wait to see if that is the case. \u2019Tis truth you\u2019ve no skill at loving, and \u2019tis obvious I\u2019ve none as well.\u201d</p><p>Ewan\u2019s mouth gaped open. He was sure he hadn\u2019t heard correctly. No skill? His mouth closed then fell open and then he snapped it shut with the force of his incredulity.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201c \u2019Tis a well-known fact that a man is either skilled in matters of loving or matters of war. \u2019Tis obvious that fighting is your skill.\u201d</p><p>Ewan winced. The little wench was shredding his manhood. His cock positively shriveled under her criticism. Anger warred with exasperation until he saw the tremble of her lower lip and the trepidation in her eyes.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cAh, lass, \u2019tis true I bedded you with all the skill of a stable boy with his first woman.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flushed a delicate pink, and he kicked himself for his coarseness. He dug his fingers into his hair.</p><p>\u201cYou were a virgin. \u2019Tis unlikely anything I could have done would have made it good, but there is a lot I could have done to make it more pleasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have liked pleasant,\u201d she said wistfully.</p><p>He cursed. How badly had he hurt her? He knew he hadn\u2019t given her the pleasure or patience she deserved. At the time, all he\u2019d known was that he had to consummate the marriage with all haste. There hadn\u2019t been time to seduce a shy virgin. Only now his shy virgin had turned into a stubborn, unwilling wife.</p><p>\u201cMairin, the marriage wasn\u2019t valid until I bedded you. I couldn\u2019t risk having something happen before I had the chance to bed you. If you\u2019d been captured, Cameron could have taken you and petitioned to have our marriage set aside. He would have bedded you and got you with child to strengthen his claim.\u201d</p><p>Her lip trembled and she cast her eyes downward to where her fingers twisted nervously at her skirts.</p><p>He took advantage of her momentary distraction and closed in. He reached down and took her hands in his. She was small and soft. Delicate. The idea that he\u2019d been too rough, that he\u2019d hurt her, unsettled him.</p><p>He should suffer no guilt for taking his wife. Her duty was to provide him pleasure, however he saw fit to take it. But the memory of her tear-filled eyes was a fist to his gut.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be like that from now on.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyes to his and her brow wrinkled in confusion. \u201cIt won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, it won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He tempered his irritation and reminded himself that she needed a gentle hand right now.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m quite skilled in loving,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I plan to show you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth rounded, and she tried to take a step back. He held her hands tightly in his and pulled her back until she bumped into his chest.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, I intend to show you how very skilled I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and stared into his eyes, her own, wide and confused. \u201cWhen do you plan to do this, Laird?\u201d</p><p>He bent and swept his mouth over hers. \u201cRight now.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>Mairin put her hands on Ewan\u2019s chest to steady herself, else she would have fallen under his relentless assault on her senses. She sighed and leaned farther into his kiss, not even protesting when his tongue slid sensuously over her bottom lip as he coaxed her to open.</p><p>The man might not be skilled in loving, but she could drown in his kisses. Maybe he\u2019d be amenable to continue kissing and forego the rest.</p><p>\u201cKiss me back,\u201d he murmured. \u201cOpen your mouth. Let me taste you.\u201d</p><p>His words slid like velvet over her skin. She shivered as her breasts plumped and swelled. An ache began deep in her body, in parts that didn\u2019t bear mentioning. How was he able to incite such a response when all he was doing was kissing her?</p><p>His palms glided up her waist and then up over her shoulders and up her neck until he framed her face. The heat from his touch branded her. It felt as though she\u2019d have permanent marks on her cheeks from his fingers, and yet he was exquisitely gentle, the tips glancing over her skin like tiny winged creatures.</p><p>Unable to deny the probing of his tongue, she relaxed her mouth and allowed him to slide inside. Warm and rough. So very sinful. It was a decadent senson, one she was certain she should deny herself, but she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>The temptation to taste him back was strong. So strong that it beat an incessant rhythm at her temples, in her mind, at her very core. Shyly she brushed her tongue over his lips. He groaned and she immediately pulled back, afraid she\u2019d done something wrong.</p><p>He hauled her right back and captured her mouth once again in a ravenous fashion that left her breathless.</p><p>\u201cDo it again,\u201d he whispered. \u201cTaste me.\u201d</p><p>From the sound of it, he hadn\u2019t disliked her touching him with her tongue. Tentatively she licked over his lip again. He relaxed his mouth against hers, opening so she had access.</p><p>Feeling braver, she boldly pushed forward, hot and wet. She shivered from the sheer carnality of something so simple as a kiss. She felt naked and vulnerable, as if she was spread out and underneath him as he slaked his lust over and over. Only this time she burned for him. She wanted him over her, his body covering hers. She felt twitchy and anxious, like her skin was too tight.</p><p>\u201cThis time I\u2019ll undress you as I should,\u201d he whispered, as he walked her back toward the bed.</p><p>Her mind was dim and she was slow sorting through her muddled thoughts. She frowned, knowing he didn\u2019t have the right of it again. Was she forever going to have to instruct him?</p><p>\u201cI should undress you. \u2019Tis my duty,\u201d she said.</p><p>He grinned. \u201c \u2019Tis only your duty when I say it is. Tonight I fully intend to undress you and enjoy every moment. You deserve a slow wooing, lass. This will be your wedding night all over again. If I could go back and do it all differently, I would. But I\u2019ll give you the next best thing. I\u2019ll give you tonight.\u201d</p><p>The promise in his voice shook her to her toes. She blinked as he lowered her dress over one shoulder and then followed a line down her neck and over the curve of her arm with his lips.</p><p>Each inch of her skin he uncovered, he kissed, sliding downward until her dress fell away, leaving her nearly bare under his gaze. Each layer pooled at her feet, until she was naked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he husked, his warm breath whispering over the chill bumps that dotted her flesh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He cupped one breast, palming it so the pale globe plumped upward. Her nipple contracted and beaded so tight that it sent tiny shards of lightning through her belly.</p><p>Then he bent and flicked his tongue over the erect nub, and her knees promptly buckled. She landed on the bed with a soft bounce, and he chuckled lightly as he followed her down.</p><p>With a gentle nudge, he had her on her back and he loomed over her, so big and strong. He stared so unabashedly at her nakedness that she reached for the covers, something, anything, to make her not feel so vulnerable.</p><p>He stayed her hand with his, his gaze tender as he met hers. 0em\"y, don\u2019t cover yourself, lass. You\u2019re an exquisite sight. Unrivaled by any woman I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d He trailed a finger over the curve of her waist to her hip and then back up again until he rubbed over her taut nipples. \u201cYou\u2019re skin is as soft as the finest silk. And your breasts ... they remind me of ripe melons just waiting to be tasted.\u201d</p><p>She tried to suck in air but her lungs burned from the effort. Each breath felt tight. She panted shallowly, feeling more light-headed by the minute.</p><p>He backed away from the bed, and for a moment, she panicked. Where was he going? But he began shedding his clothing in a much more impatient manner than he\u2019d divested her of hers. He kicked off his boots and then ripped off his tunic and trews, tossing them across the room.</p><p>Looking at him was inevitable. She couldn\u2019t have glanced away if she wanted. There was something intensely mesmerizing about the rugged, work-honed contours of his body. Scars, some old, some much newer, traced paths over his flesh. There wasn\u2019t a single bit of spare flesh to be seen. Muscles tightened his chest and even his abdomen, where so many men went soft with age. Not her warrior. This was a man honed in the fires of battle.</p><p>With a nervous swallow, she dropped her gaze to the juncture of his legs, curious to see the part of him that had caused her such pain before. Her eyes widened at the sight of him jutting so hard and ... big. She began backing up toward the bed before she even realized what she was doing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be frightened,\u201d he murmured, as he lowered himself over her. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you this time, Mairin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI won\u2019t. You\u2019re going to like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, lass, you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He kissed her lips, warm and so tender. It was a ridiculous notion, but he made her feel so very protected and cherished. She now had two very conflicting views on loving because this ... this was very nice.</p><p>He continued to kiss her, sliding his mouth down the line of her jaw and then lower to her neck and the tender flesh just below her ear. He paused a moment and sucked wetly before grazing his teeth over her pulse point.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>She felt him smile against her neck, but he never removed his mouth. Instead he trailed lower to her chest until he was precariously close to her breasts. Remembering her reaction when he put his tongue on her nipple, she found herself arching into him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t tease, and for that she was thankful. She was strung so tight that she feared what was going to happen to her. His lips closed around one nipple and he sucked hard. Her back bowed and her hands flew to grip his hair. Oh saints, but this was a wondrous sensation.</p><p>He suckled, in turns hard, and then gentle and rhythmic. His tongue circled sensitive flesh, and his teeth nipped ever so lightly, coaxing the bud to an even harder point.</p><p>\u201cSweet. So sweet,\u201d he said, as he moved his mouth to her other breast.</p><p>She sighed, though the sound came out more as a garbled utterance than a breathy exclamation. The chill of the chamber no longer bothered her. She felt rather like she\u2019d been lying in a meadow on a warm summer day, allowing the sun\u2019s rays to melt her to her bones.</p><p>Aye, boneless was an apt description.</p> <p>As he suckled at her breast, his fingers glided down her belly, caressing for a moment before he carefully worked his way down to the juncture of her thighs. The moment his finger slid through her folds, she tensed.</p><p>\u201cShhh, lass. Relax. I\u2019m only going to bring you pleasure.\u201d</p><p>His finger found a particularly sensitive spot and he began to rub lightly and then rotate in a circular motion. She gasped and then squeezed her eyes shut as she was bombarded by the most intense pleasure. Just as he\u2019d promised.</p><p>There was a curious tightening as her body drew up. Her muscles clenched. Precarious. That\u2019s how she felt. Like she was about to fall off a very high peak.</p><p>\u201cEwan!\u201d</p><p>His name fell from her lips, and in the recesses of her blurry mind, she realized this was the first time she\u2019d used it.</p><p>He released her nipple and her hand tightened in his hair. The she realized she was still clutching his head with a death grip. She let go and let her hands fall to the bed. But she needed to grab something.</p><p>He pressed his tongue to her midline and slowly worked a damp trail to her belly. Her stomach heaved as her breaths came faster. He traced a lazy trail around her navel and then to her utter shock, he went lower, moving his body down the bed as he worked ever closer to the place where his fingers had caressed.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t. Surely such a thing wasn\u2019t at all decent.</p><p>Oh, but he did....</p><p>His mouth found her heat in a lusty, carnal kiss that made every muscle in her body twitch and convulse as if she\u2019d been struck by lightning.</p><p>She should tell him he shouldn\u2019t. She should tell him he couldn\u2019t. She should offer instruction on the proper way to do things, but dear heaven, she couldn\u2019t think anything at all beyond don\u2019t stop.</p><p>Please don\u2019t stop.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, lass,\u201d he murmured against her most intimate flesh.</p><p>Her legs had gone stiff and unyielding around him, and he gently forced them back apart.</p><p>\u201cRelax.\u201d</p><p>She tried. Oh, but she tried, but his mouth was making her daft. And then his tongue found her, so hot and erotic. A wash of indescribable pleasure soared through her belly as he lapped at her entrance. Her vision blurred and she twisted her fingers into the covers until they were bloodless and all sensation fled.</p><p>She had no control of her body any longer. She arched mindlessly, and her legs shook, the tremors working to her thighs until she was a mass of quaking flesh.</p><p>\u201cAh, you\u2019re ready for me, lass.\u201d</p><p>His voice deepened to a hoarse, almost desperate tone. She chanced a look down to see him staring at her, his eyes bright and savage looking.</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cAye, you are.\u201d</p><p>He moved up her body with speed that surprised her. He cupped her bottom with one hand and settled his body between her legs. She could feel him, hot and unbelievably hard, nestled against her opening.</p><p>Then he leaned down and fused his mouth to hers. This time she didn\u2019t hesitate, nor did she think to instruct him on the proper way of kissing. She opened her mouth and devoured him before he ever had the opportunity to demand she did so.</p><p>\u201cHold on to me,\u201d he rasped out between hot, open-mouthed kisses.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his broad shoulders and dug her fingers into his back. She kissed him. She tasted him. She absorbed him, breathing him in with each gasp for air.</p><p>Before she even realized he had moved, he had lifted his hips and slid inside her the barest of inches. She stretched to accommodate him and then wondered how she\u2019d been able to do so.</p><p>He kissed her again and then rested his forehead to hers, their eyes so close, all she could see was the thin ring of green that surrounded the dark pupils.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he said again. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She raised her lips to meet his. This time their mouths met in a delicate dance, the tenderest of touches. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>And she did know. Somehow, she knew that this was different. There was no rush. No unpleasant shock to her senses. Her body melded to his, surrendering to his power and his need. To her need.</p><p>His hips moved forward with infinitesimal slowness. She opened around him as he slid deeper. The fullness overwhelmed her, but it wasn\u2019t pain or surprise that rocked her body.</p><p>\u201cAlmost there,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Her eyes widened as he went even farther and then he stopped, lodged so deeply within her that she couldn\u2019t breathe. He surrounded her, gathering her in his arms, holding her close as he began moving, a slow, seductive rhythm that had her mad with want.</p><p>The muscles in his back rippled and bulged. Her fingers danced across his flesh in a fr, seducc pattern as she sought purchase. Something to anchor herself with when she was adrift in a storm.</p><p>His movements increased, faster and more forceful. Their sighs caught and mingled in the air heavy with the scent of their loving.</p><p>\u201cWrap your legs around me,\u201d he directed. \u201cHold me tight, lass.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her entire body around him until she was sure they were so inexorably entwined that they\u2019d never come apart.</p><p>The burning sensation increased until she stirred restlessly, frantic for ... release. Breathing hurt, so she didn\u2019t, and her chest protested, but she held on, reaching for something she had no sense of.</p><p>And then she came apart, unraveling like the threads in an unfinished tapestry. She screamed, or tried to, but Ewan\u2019s mouth closed over hers, and he swallowed her frantic cry.</p><p>She had no control of her body. She couldn\u2019t think. Could only feel, helpless to do anything but lie in Ewan\u2019s arms as he murmured soft words against her ears.</p><p>Utterly bewildered by what had occurred, she fixed unfocused eyes on her husband as an expression of agony creased his face. He gave one more mighty thrust, seating himself deeply within her body. Then he slumped over her, pressing her into the mattress as he gave her his seed.</p><p>She nestled her face into the hollow of his throat, so sated and completely boneless that she considered staying in bed for the next year. Ewan rested over her for a long moment before finally easing his weight from her and rolling to the side.</p><p>He gathered her into his arms and stroked her hair. Then he pressed a kiss to her temple and let his cheek rest against the side of her head.</p><p>Her befuddled mind couldn\u2019t make sense of what had just happened. Only one thing struck strongly in her mind.</p><p>\u201cEwan?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>It took him a moment to respond. \u201cAye, lass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wrong.\u201d</p><p>He stirred, rubbing his face against her cheek. \u201cWhat were you wrong about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very skilled at loving.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and then hugged her tighter to him. Yawning broadly, she snuggled deeper into his arms and closed her eyes.</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>When Mairin awoke, she was momentarily disoriented. She blinked away the fuzziness. Her head still felt muggy but her body, while only a little stiff and sore from her bruises, was surprisingly warm and sated. Limp, like she\u2019d enjoyed a prolonged soak in a steaming tub of water.</p><p>Light perced through the window that no longer had the fur covering it, and the sun\u2019s height told her she\u2019d slept far later than she\u2019d intended.</p><p>Gertie wouldn\u2019t be pleased, and Mairin would have to wait for the noon meal. For that matter, it might be noon already.</p><p>The night came back to her in a rush. Heat centered low in her abdomen and scorched higher until her cheeks were flaming. She sat up, then realized she was completely nude. She grabbed the bed coverings and clutched them to her chin, then dropped them in disgust.</p><p>She was alone in the bedchamber. No one was going to see her. Still, she scrambled from the bed and hastily donned her clothing.</p><p>Her hair was in disarray and a quick feel of her cheeks told of the flush that was still there. She probably looked like a hot coal.</p><p>She\u2019d actually told the laird that he wasn\u2019t skilled at loving. Aye, he\u2019d showed her differently. He\u2019d done things that she hadn\u2019t imagined two people ever doing. His mouth ... and his tongue.</p><p>She flushed all over again and closed her eyes in mortification. How could she ever face him again?</p><p>Mairin adored Mother Serenity. She trusted her above all others. The abbess had been good to Mairin. And patient. Aye, she\u2019d had the patience of Job when it came to instructing Mairin and answering all the questions Mairin had plied her with. But it was becoming increasingly clear that perhaps the abbess had left out a lot about loving. And kissing.</p><p>Mairin frowned as she pondered just how different the teachings of the older woman had been from the startling reality of bedding. If the abbess had been wrong about kissing ... and loving ... what else could she be wrong about? Mairin felt suddenly ignorant and woefully uninformed.</p><p>Never one to stew in her own ignorance, she decided that she would just have to seek out instruction on the matter. Christina ... well, she was too young. And unmarried. Gertie frightened Mairin with her sharp retorts. Besides, she\u2019d probably just laugh at Mairin and shoo her out of the kitchens. Which left Maddie. She was older and certainly more worldly. Plus, she had a husband, so surely she could offer insight into loving and who had the wrong of it.</p><p>Feeling better about her plan, she brushed the tangles out of her hair and braided it so she didn\u2019t look like she\u2019d just spent the night indulging in loving. Then she headed out of her chamber and descended the stairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To her chagrin, Cormac was waiting in the hall. As soon as she entered, he rose and fell in step beside her. She shot him a disgruntled look, but he merely smiled and offered her greeting.</p><p>Deciding not to offer him any encouragement, she instead pretended he wasn\u2019t there and went toward the kitchens to brave Gertie\u2019s wrath. When she got to the doorway, the ruckus within made her pause.</p><p>There was an awful clanging and banging of pots and Gertie\u2019s voice rose above the din as she screeched her displeasure at one of the kitchen maids.</p><p>Maybe it wasn\u2019t the time to try to cajole a late breakfast from the cranky cook.</p> <p>\u201cUh, Cormac?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it close to time for the noon meal? I confess I slept over late this morning. I didn\u2019t at all sleep well last night,\u201d she rushed to say. She didn\u2019t want to give Cormac the idea that her lateness was due to anything else.</p><p>He smothered a smile with the back of his hand and then summoned a more serious expression. She glared at him for his thoughts were plainly written in his smug look.</p><p>\u201cHe probably boasted to everyone,\u201d she muttered.</p> <p>\u201cYour pardon, my lady?\u201d Cormac said as he leaned forward.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis approaching the noon meal. Perhaps another hour at most. If you like, I\u2019ll ask Gertie for a plate if you\u2019re hungry now.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach growled at the suggestion of food, but a wary glance at the kitchen when another crash sounded decided the matter for her.</p><p>\u201cNay, I can wait. I have other things to do.\u201d</p><p>She set off at a determined pace, hoping Cormac would take the hint and leave off. But he dogged her steps, keeping pace with her as she descended the steps of the keep.</p> <p>She was greeted by a blast of sunshine that warmed her despite the chill. She hadn\u2019t remembered the shawl that Maddie had left for her, and she was loath to go back up the stairs to fetch it. Unless ...</p><p>She turned and gifted Cormac with a sweet smile. \u201cI left my shawl in the laird\u2019s chamber and there is still a chill to the air. Would you mind ever so much fetching it for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, my lady. It wouldn\u2019t do for you to take a chill. The laird would be most unhappy. Wait right here and I\u2019ll have it for you in just a moment.\u201d</p><p>She stood demurely until the moment he disappeared back into the keep and then she set off at a brisk walk, careful to avoid the courtyard. On the way, she stopped two women and asked if they knew where she could find Maddie. After being told that Maddie was in her cottage after her morning duties, Mairin hurried toward the row of neat cottages that lined the left side of the keep.</p><p>When she reached Maddie\u2019s door, she took a deep breath and knocked. A moment later, Maddie opened the door and seemed surprised to see Mairin standing there.</p><p>\u201cMy lady! Is there something I can help you with?\u201d</p><p>Mairin glanced over her shoulder to make sure Cormac wasn\u2019t breathing down her neck.</p><p>\u201cThere is. That is, I hoped there is something you could instruct me on,\u201d Mairin said a low voice. \u201cIn private.\u201d</p> <p>Maddie stepped back and motioned Mairin inside. \u201cOf course. Do come in. Would you like refreshment? I was warming some rabbit stew over the fire. My husband does like a nice hot bowl of stew for his luncheon, but he won\u2019t be here to eat for a little while yet.\u201d</p><p>Remembering her missed breakfast and her rumbling belly, Mairin sniffed appreciatively of the air and the wonderful smell emanating from Maddie\u2019s kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIf \u2019tis not too much trouble. I did oversleep this morning,\u201d Mairin said mournfully. Maddie smiled and gestured for Mairin to follow her into the small area that housed the hearth for cooking. \u201cI heard Gertie was in quite a temper this morning.\u201d</p><p>Mairin nodded. \u201c \u2019Tis the truth I feared for my life if I ventured in after missing the morning meal.\u201d</p><p>Maddie pulled out a chair and ushered Mairin into it and then set about dishing up some of the stew into a bowl. She handed it to Mairin and then took her own seat across the table.</p><p>\u201cNow, my lady, what is it you would like me to instruct you on?\u201d</p><p>Before Mairin could open her mouth, a knock sounded at the front door. Maddie frowned but got up to see about the summons. A moment later she returned with Christina and Bertha, whose eyes rounded when they saw Mairin sitting at Maddie\u2019s table.</p><p>\u201cOh, my lady,\u201d Christina exclaimed. \u201cWe were just coming to see if Maddie knew of your whereabouts. Cormac has the entire keep in an uproar trying to find you.\u201d</p><p>Mairin let out a sigh. \u201cI persuaded him to fetch my shawl so I could seek Maddie\u2019s advice about something. \u2019Tis a private matter, you see, and not appropriate for Cormac\u2019s ears.\u201d</p><p>Bertha grinned broadly. \u201cThen we needn\u2019t tell him where you are.\u201d</p><p>Mairin nodded her appreciation and fully expected the two women to depart, but both sat down at Maddie\u2019s table, and Bertha leaned forward in interest.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you wish instruction on, my lady? We\u2019re all willing to help. You\u2019re our mistress now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur lady said it was a private matter,\u201d Maddie scolded.</p><p>Mairin nodded. \u201cAye. A delicate matter, indeed.\u201d</p><p>Warmth traveled into her cheeks and she was sure her face was afire.</p><p>\u201cAh, a woman\u2019s matter,\u201d Bertha said knowingly. \u201cYou can tell us, lass. We\u2019re very discreet.\u201d</p><p>Maddie nodded her agreement while Christina looked on in puzzlement.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Mairin began reluctantly. \u201cPerhaps it would be better to gain more than one perspective on the matter. \u2019Tis the truth I\u2019m a bit confused at the coflicting information. You see, Mother Serenity instructed me on the ways of loving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear Lord,\u201d Bertha muttered. \u201cLass, tell me you didn\u2019t receive all your instructions from an aging abbess.\u201d</p><p>Startled, Mairin stared back at the other woman. \u201cWhy aye, Mother Serenity is knowledgeable in all things. She wouldn\u2019t lie to me. I think perhaps I may have confused some of her instructions. There were so many, you see.\u201d</p><p>Maddie shook her head and made a tsking sound through her teeth.</p><p>\u201cTell us what you want to know, child. I can assure you that your Mother Serenity, while well intentioned, couldn\u2019t possibly have told you the whole of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she instructed me on kissing, and the laird\u2014\u201d She broke off, mortified at the idea of saying aloud what was in her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d This time Christina piped in and leaned forward, her eyes round with curiosity.</p><p>\u201cWell, he used his tongue. Mother Serenity never said anything about the use of one\u2019s tongue in kissing. She was quite explicit in the matter.\u201d</p><p>Maddie and Bertha chuckled and exchanged knowing glances.</p><p>\u201cTell me, lass, did you enjoy the laird\u2019s kisses?\u201d Maddie asked.</p><p>Mairin nodded. \u201c \u2019Tis the truth I did, and I have to admit, I used my own. It was quite ... breathless. I don\u2019t understand it at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKissing with tongues?\u201d Christina\u2019s eyes went wide.</p><p>Maddie frowned at Christina and then made a shooing motion with her hands. \u201cLass, you\u2019re far too young for this conversation. Why don\u2019t you go stand outside and keep watch for Cormac.\u201d</p><p>Mairin noted Christina\u2019s crestfallen look but she didn\u2019t argue. Christina stood and left the room. Only when the sound of the front door closing reached them did Bertha and Maddie return their attention to Mairin.</p><p>\u201cIs that all you were wanting to know?\u201d Maddie asked.</p><p>Mairin shifted in her seat and wondered if she shouldn\u2019t abandon the entire notion and return to the keep so Cormac could lecture her for her desertion.</p><p>\u201cThere now, lass,\u201d Bertha said in a kindly voice. \u201cAsk us what you want. We won\u2019t be telling tales on you.\u201d</p><p>Mairin cleared her throat. \u201cWell, I might have told the laird that he was unskilled at loving.\u201d</p><p>Both women looked so appalled that Mairin regretted blurting out that tidbit. Then they burst into laughter. They laughed so long and hard that they wiped tears streaming down their cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAnd how did the laird take tis?\u201d Maddie gasped out between wheezes.</p><p>\u201cNot very well,\u201d Mairin grumbled. \u201cI did later tell him I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>Bertha grinned. \u201cAh, you were, were you?\u201d</p><p>Maddie nodded approvingly. \u201cProved you wrong, did he? You can\u2019t hold your wedding day against him, lass. It was your first time. Not much he could have done would have helped in that regard. Better to get it done with and over, I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe what?\u201d Bertha asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was indecent,\u201d Mairin muttered.</p><p>Maddie stifled her laughter with a hand, but her eyes danced merrily. \u201cBut you liked it, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Mairin admitted. \u201cHe did things....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he used his mouth.\u201d Mairen leaned forward and whispered, \u201cDown there. And on my ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour breasts?\u201d Bertha asked.</p><p>Mairin closed her eyes in mortification and nodded.</p><p>Both women chuckled and leaned back in their chairs.</p><p>\u201cSounds like the laddie has the right of it then,\u201d Maddie said, approval firm in her voice. \u201cYou\u2019re a lucky lass to have a skilled man in your bed. Not every woman does.\u201d</p><p>Mairin frowned. \u201cThey don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Bertha shook her head. \u201cNow don\u2019t be telling anyone I told you so, but my Michael, well, it took him a few years before he developed any skill. If it weren\u2019t for a few discussions with some ladies older than I, I\u2019m not sure we would have ever gotten it right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, \u2019twas the same with my Ranold,\u201d Maddie said. \u201cHe was always in such a hurry. It wasn\u2019t until I threatened to withhold my charms that he made an effort to work on his skills.\u201d</p><p>Mairin\u2019s head was spinning at the women\u2019s chatter. Such intimate matters didn\u2019t seem to bother the other two women whatsoever. Mairin on the other hand was ready for the earth to swallow her up.</p><p>Maddie reached across the table and put her hand over Mairin\u2019s. She squeezed and offered Mairin a smile. \u201cLet me give you some advice, lass. If you don\u2019t mind an old woman offering it.\u201d</p><p>Mairin slowly nodded.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis not enough for your man to be skilled in matters of loving. You need to have some skills yourself.\u201d</p><p>Bertha nodded vehemently. \u201cAye, \u0201tis the truth. If you keep your man satisfied in the bed chamber, he won\u2019t have any cause to stray.\u201d</p><p>Stray? Mairin looked at them in horror. \u201cAre you suggesting that the laird wouldn\u2019t be faithful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, of course we wouldn\u2019t disparage the laird. But \u2019tis a fact, \u2019tis better to be safe than sorry. You want your laird to be well satisfied. Men are far more amenable when they\u2019re sated from loving.\u201d</p><p>Maddie slapped Bertha on the shoulder and laughed. \u201cAye, now that\u2019s the truth. The best time to ask a boon is just after a rousing bout of loving.\u201d</p><p>Amenable was good. Mairin liked the idea of that. And now that the disturbing thought of Ewan\u2019s fidelity had entered her head, she couldn\u2019t shake it. Surely he wouldn\u2019t?</p><p>\u201cWhat things should I know?\u201d Mairin asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, you said he used his mouth. You know, down there,\u201d Bertha said with a twinkle in her eyes. \u201cYou can do the same to him, lass. \u2019Tis guaranteed to drive him wild.\u201d</p><p>Mairin was sure her absolute ignorance was reflected in her expression. And her horror. She started to say something, but the image of what Bertha was describing hit her square between the eyes and she couldn\u2019t shake it.</p><p>\u201cHow ...?\u201d She couldn\u2019t even finish the question. What was she supposed to ask?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve shocked the lass,\u201d Maddie said reproachfully.</p><p>Bertha shrugged. \u201cNo point in dillydallying around the point. The lass has to learn from someone. Her Mother Serenity certainly didn\u2019t do her any favors.\u201d</p><p>Maddie put her hand back over Mairin\u2019s. \u201cWhat Bertha means is that a man likes being kissed ... down there. On his cock.\u201d</p><p>Bertha snorted. \u201cTell her right, Maddie. A man likes to be suckled.\u201d</p><p>Mairin was sure the blood leeched right out of her cheeks. Kissed? Suckled?</p><p>\u201cYou liked it well enough, didn\u2019t you, lass?\u201d Bertha asked. \u201cA man is no different. He likes to be touched and caressed with a lass\u2019s hands, mouth, and tongue.\u201d</p><p>It was true enough that Mairin did enjoy Ewan\u2019s touches. And his kisses. He was skilled with his tongue. Aye, she liked his tongue, even if he did indecent things with it.</p><p>\u201cPutting my ... my ... mouth on his ...\u201d She couldn\u2019t bring herself to say the word. \u201c \u2019Tisn\u2019t decent, surely!\u201d</p><p>Bertha rolled her eyes and Maddie laughed.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s little decency to good loving,\u201d Maddie said sagely. \u201cIf \u2019tis decent, it isn\u2019t much fn.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bertha nodded, her lips compressed as her head bobbed up and down. \u201cNothing wrong with a nice, dirty romp.\u201d</p><p>Mairin could scarcely believe what she was hearing. She was going to have to think on this matter. Before she could thank Maddie and Bertha and be on her way, a pounding on the door startled the women.</p><p>Maddie rose and went to the door, Mairin and Bertha right behind her. Mairin had a very good idea who was at the door, but when Maddie opened it, it was worse than Mairin had feared.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Cormac waiting to lecture her. Ewan stood with Caelen, arms crossed over his chest, a scowl darkening his features. Christina stood to the side, her eyes apologetic.</p> <p>\u201cCare to explain yourself?\u201d Ewan demanded.</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>Instead of answering her husband, Mairin turned to Maddie and Bertha and offered a polite curtsy. \u201cThank you both for your counsel.\u201d</p><p>When she turned around again, Ewan was still glaring holes in her while Caelen looked annoyed that he\u2019d been summoned on the errand to locate Mairin. She tried to walk past Ewan as she exited Maddie\u2019s cottage, but he didn\u2019t budge. She shoved but he was an immovable object.</p><p>Finally she stepped back. \u201cYou wished to speak with me, Laird?\u201d</p> <p>Ewan emitted a loud sigh and then took her arm in his not-so-gentle grasp. Mairin offered a wave to the women as Ewan hauled her along beside him. She stumbled and had to run to keep up, else she\u2019d find herself dragged across the ground by her fuming husband.</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder to see Caelen following close behind. She shot him a disgruntled look in the hopes he\u2019d disappear, but he didn\u2019t look impressed with her silent demand for privacy.</p><p>Finally Ewan halted some distance from the cottages. He loomed over her like some avenging warrior out for blood. Though she tried to face him bravely, some part of her shrunk to a ridiculous size. He was angry. Nay, angry didn\u2019t aptly describe his mood. He was furious.</p><p>It took him a few moments and repeated attempts before he was able to get his reprimand out. His mouth opened and snapped shut several times and he looked away as if collecting his temper.</p><p>She waited demurely, her hands folded together, and she stared up at him with wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even look at me with those doe eyes,\u201d Ewan growled. \u201cYou disobeyed me. Again. I\u2019ve half a mind to lock you in our chamber. Forever.\u201d</p> <p>When she didn\u2019t respond to that threat, Ewan blew out his breath.</p><p>\u201cWell? What explanation would you like to offer for sending Cormac on an erran and then promptly leaving his escort?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed to speak with Maddie,\u201d Mairin said.</p><p>Ewan stared at her for a long moment. \u201cThat\u2019s it? You disregarded not only my order but acted in complete disregard for your safety because you needed to speak to Maddie?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Twas a delicate matter,\u201d Mairin defended.</p><p>Ewan closed his eyes and his lips moved in silence. Was he counting? It made no sense to practice mathematics at such a time.</p><p>\u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t have had Cormac walk you to Maddie\u2019s cottage?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him in horror. \u201cNay! Of course not. It wasn\u2019t a matter for a man to hear. \u2019Twas a private issue and one I had no wish to discuss in front of others.\u201d</p> <p>Ewan\u2019s eyes rolled heavenward. \u201cHe could have waited outside the cottage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might have overheard through the window,\u201d Mairin countered.</p><p>\u201cMy time is too valuable to spend scouring the keep every time you decide you need to have a private word with one of the women,\u201d Ewan declared. \u201cFrom now on, you\u2019ll either have the escort of one of my brothers or my commanders. If you persist in your actions, you\u2019ll be confined to your chamber. Is that understood?\u201d</p><p>Caelen didn\u2019t look any more pleased with Ewan\u2019s dictate than she was. It was apparent he was appalled by the duty Ewan had charged him with.</p><p>\u201cI said, is that understood?\u201d</p><p>Mairin reluctantly nodded.</p><p>Ewan turned and pointed at Caelen. \u201cYou stay with Mairin. I have immediate matters to attend to.\u201d</p><p>The annoyed look on Caelen\u2019s face didn\u2019t sit well with Mairin, so she stuck out her tongue at him as Ewan strode away in the direction of the courtyard.</p><p>Caelen crossed his arms over his chest and glared at Mairin. \u201cPerhaps it would be best if you return to the hall for the noon meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but I\u2019m not hungry anymore,\u201d Mairin said cheerfully. \u201cMaddie was kind enough to provide me with a bowl of delicious rabbit stew.\u201d</p><p>Caelen scowled. \u201cThen perhaps you should go up to your chamber and take a nap. A long nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMairin! Mairin!\u201d</p><p>Mairin turned in the direction of Crispen\u2019s voice to see him running toward her with three other children trailing him.</p><p>\u201cMairin, come play with us,\u201d Crispen said, tugging at her hand. \u201cWe\u2019re having races and we need you to judge.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and allowith.</p><p>Caelen sighed loudly and lengthened his stride to keep up with them, but Mairin didn\u2019t pay him any attention. If he must watch over her at every turn, she would do her best to pretend he wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>She laughed softly at the idea of pretending a man of Caelen\u2019s size could possibly be overlooked. He was as fierce and as muscled as any of Ewan\u2019s warriors, and he loomed over her like a giant tree.</p><p>Nay, she wouldn\u2019t be successful in pretending he wasn\u2019t following her, but she could ignore him at least.</p><p>A peek at his harried expression made unwanted guilt surge inside her chest. She frowned. She didn\u2019t want to feel guilty. Not for wanting a bit of freedom now that she was away from the abbey.</p><p>But still, the guilt grew until she was wringing her hands in front of her as she followed Crispen and the other children to an area adjacent to the keep.</p><p>She stopped abruptly and whirled around, causing Caelen to nearly run into her. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to cooperate and allow you to escort me about the keep.\u201d</p><p>Caelen merely raised an eyebrow in disbelief. \u201cYou expect me to believe you\u2019re going to meekly submit to Ewan\u2019s wishes?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head mournfully. \u201cI\u2019ve been unfair. I offer my apologies. It isn\u2019t your fault your laird is unreasonable. Nay, the fault lies with him. You\u2019re only doing your duty. I should endeavor to make it easier and not harder for you. I\u2019m well aware of the burden he has given you.\u201d</p><p>If she expected him to refute the idea that she was a burden, she was sorely disappointed. He merely gazed at her with a bored expression.</p><p>\u201cAt any rate, I give my word that I won\u2019t resort to trickery again,\u201d she said solemnly.</p><p>She turned back to the children who were arguing over who got to race first. She waded into the fray, laughing and fending off overeager hands.</p><p>An hour later, she was exhausted. Who knew children could drain the life right out of a body? Mairin stopped in her pursuit of Crispen and bent over as she gasped for air in a decidedly unladylike fashion.</p><p>The screaming children surrounded her and she turned to find Caelen surveying the goings-on with something that looked very much like a grimace.</p><p>\u201cI should make you chase them,\u201d she called. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be guarding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuarding, not herding children,\u201d came Caelen\u2019s terse reply.</p><p>\u201cI think we should attack him,\u201d Mairin muttered.</p><p>\u201cOh, let\u2019s do!\u201d Crispen whispered.</p><p>\u201cAye, aye!\u201d the children surrounding them chanted.</p><p>Mairin smiled as the evil thought coalesced. The image of the warrior on the ground begging for mercy would be a sight to behold.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she whispered back. \u201cBut we must be stealthy about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike warriors!\u201d Robbie exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cAye, like warriors. Like your fathers,\u201d she added.</p><p>The boys puffed out their chests, but the few girls who had assembled looked disgruntled.</p><p>\u201cWhat about us, Mairin?\u201d Gretchen, a girl of eight years, asked. \u201cGirls can be warriors, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, they can\u2019t!\u201d Crispen said in an appalled voice. \u201cFighting is for men. Girls are to be protected. My papa said so.\u201d</p><p>The looks in the girls\u2019 eyes were murderous, so to prevent a civil war among the children, Mairin gathered them all close. \u201cAye, girls can be warriors, too, Gretchen. Here\u2019s what we must do.\u201d</p><p>The huddled together and she whispered her instructions.</p><p>The boys weren\u2019t happy with their role in the attack. The girls were delighted with theirs. After a quick recounting of their instructions, the girls broke away and skipped toward the keep. As soon as they were past Caelen, they halted and turned back to sneak up on him from behind. Caelen was too distracted by the crowd of rowdy boys approaching him from the front.</p><p>He looked suspiciously at Crispen and then over his head to Mairin. She smiled innocently and waited.</p><p>Caelen never knew what hit him. Screaming like banshees, the girls hit him from behind. They leapt on Caelen\u2019s back and swarmed over him like a horde of locusts.</p><p>Shouting his surprise, Caelen went down amid a tangle of arms and legs and squeals of delight. The boys, not to be outdone, added their own war cries and leapt onto the pile.</p><p>After his initial surprise and much hollering and shouting, Caelen took his attack with grace. He laughed and wrestled with the children but was finally forced to cry mercy when the girls pinned him to the ground and demanded he surrender.</p><p>Caelen threw his arms up and laughingly offered his surrender. Mairin was astounded by the change in the warrior. She wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d ever seen him smile, much less laugh with obvious enjoyment as he tussled with the children. She stared at the goings-on with an open mouth, shaking her head at how good Caelen was with the children. She\u2019d imagined that she\u2019d have to step in rather quickly to defend them against his anger.</p><p>The girls were quick to cry victory while the boys protested that they had been the ones to gain Caelen\u2019s acquiescence.</p><p>\u201cCaelen, Crispen said girls can\u2019t be warriors, that \u2019tis the boys\u2019 duty to be warriors and protect the girls,\u201d Gretcen said in disgust. \u201cBut Mairin said that girls can be warriors, too. Who has the right of it?\u201d</p><p>Caelen chuckled. \u201cCrispen is right in that \u2019tis a warrior\u2019s duty to protect his lady and those weaker. However, your mistress makes a very good case for a woman warrior. She may have us all begging for mercy before the month is out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you speak the truth, brother.\u201d</p><p>Mairin whirled around to see Ewan and his commanders standing a short distance away, looking in amusement at Caelen\u2019s sound defeat at the children\u2019s hands.</p><p>She swallowed nervously, sure she was about to be handed another stern lecture about her duties, but Ewan walked forward to pick up one of the children and give him a sound dusting off.</p><p>Gretchen beamed at Mairin as she sat on Caelen\u2019s broad chest. \u201cI want to be a warrior like our laird. Why, I beat up Robbie just last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid not!\u201d Robbie roared.</p><p>\u201cDid so.\u201d</p><p>To Mairin\u2019s horror, Robbie flew at Gretchen, toppling her from Caelen\u2019s chest. She needn\u2019t have worried, however. The lass obviously hadn\u2019t boasted in vain. She flipped Robbie over and was soon straddling him and holding his arms to the ground.</p><p>Mairin sighed and went to prevent an all-out war between the girls and the boys. Ewan got there at the same time she did and reached for Robbie as she bent over to pluck Gretchen off the struggling boy.</p><p>Pain seared through her side, and then to her shock, an arrow hit the ground right beside the children and embedded deeply into the soil. Why, it had passed just between her and Ewan!</p><p>She stared aghast, appalled at how close it had come to hitting one of the children. She whirled around to locate the offending archer but found herself toppled to the ground as Caelen dove over her.</p><p>\u201cLeave off!\u201d she exclaimed, as she beat at Caelen\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat on earth are you doing? See to the children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet!\u201d he barked. \u201cEwan is seeing to the children\u2019s safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is inexcusable!\u201d Mairin exclaimed. \u201cHow could they be so careless? The children could have been killed!\u201d</p><p>Caelen covered her mouth and slowly moved his body from hers. He looked around and Mairin could see only Ewan with his arms full of children, as he, too, surveyed the area with sharp eyes. Gannon and Cormac each had a position over the remaining children and they lay still, awaiting their laird\u2019s command.</p><p>Ewan cursed, and Mairin frowned at him for uttering blasphemies in front of the children. It was another thing she\u2019d take up with him at first opportunity.</p><p>Ewan raised his head and bellowed an order. Soon the area swarmed with his men. The children were hustled back toward the kp under heavy guard, as Ewan stood and looked down at Mairin.</p><p>Caelen picked himself up from the ground and he and Ewan reached a hand down to slip under her arms. She was hoisted to her feet and she slapped at her skirts, shaking the dust off in a cloud. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before one of them could do so, she reached down and yanked the arrow from the ground. Then she slapped it against Ewan\u2019s chest, her fright giving way to fury.</p><p>\u201cHow could your men be so careless? They could have killed one of the children!\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>Ewan was every bit as furious over the incident as his wife, but he wasn\u2019t about to allow her to chastise him in front of his men.</p> <p>\u201cYou will be silent.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and she took a step back. Good, she was finally realizing her place. But then her eyes narrowed and she scowled ferociously at him.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be silent,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cYou must have a safe place for the children to play and run free. It won\u2019t do for them to be this close to the courtyard if your men can\u2019t control their aim.\u201d</p><p>He took the arrow from her and examined the markings on it. Then he looked up at her again. \u201cUntil I know who is responsible, you will cease insulting my men, and me, by thinking we would allow such a thing to happen. You may return to the keep to see to the children. Cormac will escort you.\u201d</p><p>Hurt flashed in her eyes, but she whirled around and hurried away, her skirts swinging in her haste.</p> <p>He turned to Gannon, furious over the mishap. \u201cYou will find the man who shot this arrow and you\u2019ll bring him to me. Not only could he have killed a child, he could have killed my wife.\u201d</p><p>His fingers curled into a fist at the memory of how close the arrow had come to Mairin and himself. Though the arrow hadn\u2019t struck high enough to have done serious damage to himself, to a lass Mairin\u2019s size, it would have been deadly.</p><p>His gaze dropped to the ground where Mairin had stood just moments ago. He frowned and dropped to his knee, touching the soil with his fingers. His throat closed in and his heart began to pound. Blood darkened the dirt right next to her footprints. As he followed Mairin\u2019s path away, he saw more drops.</p><p>\u201cSweet Jesu,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Ewan?\u201d Caelen asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cBlood.\u201d</p> <p>He shot to his feet and stared after his wife\u2019s retreating back. \u201cMairin!\u201d</p><p>Mairin was nearly to the steps leading into the keep when Ewan\u2019s roar stopped her ad in her tracks. She winced and turned around. The only problem was the world didn\u2019t stop turning when she did.</p><p>She swayed precariously and blinked to try to bring everything back to rights. Odd, but her knees shook and felt suspiciously jamlike. Before she knew it, she found herself kneeling on the ground, looking at her husband bearing down on her like an avenging angel.</p><p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI\u2019ve really angered him now.\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t look angry. He looked ... worried. He rushed to her and sank to his knees in front of her. Gannon stood just behind the laird, and he, too, looked very concerned. Even Caelen wore something other than his usual look of boredom. His brows were knit together, and he stared at her as if expecting her to react.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we kneeling on the ground, Laird?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI need to take you up to our chamber, lass,\u201d he said in a tone he might use with a child.</p><p>Her brow crinkled about the time pain stabbed through her side as if someone had prodded her with a hot iron. She clutched at her side and bobbled, but the laird caught her by the shoulders with gentle hands.</p> <p>\u201cBut why? Surely you can\u2019t ...\u201d She leaned forward and whispered urgently, \u201c \u2019Tis not the time for loving, Ewan. \u2019Tis broad daylight. Why, it isn\u2019t much past the noon hour.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her and then leaned forward and plucked her right off the ground. She landed with a thud against him, which sent another shard of pain through her side. She gasped and the world went a little watery as tears welled in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, lass,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cI did not mean to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps it wasn\u2019t a bad idea that he was taking her up to their chamber because it was God\u2019s truth she was suddenly so tired that it was quite a task to keep her eyes open.</p><p>\u201cIf you would stop your shouting, I could go to sleep,\u201d she said crossly.</p><p>\u201cNay, lass, don\u2019t go to sleep. Not yet. I need you to stay awake until I can assess your injuries.\u201d</p><p>He then shouted again, this time for someone to fetch the healer. Healer? She didn\u2019t need a healer. What she needed was a nice long nap. And she told the laird so.</p><p>He ignored her and carried her into their chamber, where he laid her on the bed. She was prepared to close her eyes when he began tugging at her clothing.</p><p>Her eyes flew open and she smacked his hands. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Ewan looked grim as he stared down at her. \u201cYou\u2019ve been hurt. Now let me take your clothing off so I can see where.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cHurt?\u201d Well, actually, there was a bad pain in her side.</p><p>\u201cThe arrow must have hit you,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was blood on the ground where you stood. Do you hurt anywhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy side. It does ache something fierce, now that you mention it.\u201d</p><p>When he moved his fingers up her side, she let out a whimper. He grimaced. \u201cBear with me. I\u2019m sorry, but I have to see what we\u2019re dealing with here.\u201d</p><p>He took a knife from his belt and sliced a large opening in the side of her dress.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re forever ruining my clothing,\u201d she said mournfully. \u201cBefore long, I\u2019ll have nothing to wear but my nightdress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a new dress fashioned for you,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>That cheered her considerably as he made quick work of her clothing with his knife.</p><p>He rolled her to the side that wasn\u2019t hurting and she felt him tense against her.</p><p>\u201cAh, lass, you\u2019ve gone and gotten yourself shot by an arrow.\u201d</p><p>She went rigid. And then she sputtered. \u201cGotten myself shot? More like one of your men shot me. I\u2019d like to know who it is. I\u2019ve a mind to take one of Gertie\u2019s pots to his backside.\u201d</p><p>Ewan chuckled. \u201c \u2019Tis not so bad, but you\u2019re still bleeding. You\u2019ll need stitching.\u201d</p><p>She went completely still. \u201cEwan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, lass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let them take a needle to me. Please. You said it wasn\u2019t so bad. Can\u2019t you clean it and bandage it?\u201d</p><p>She hated the pleading in her voice. She sounded weak and silly, but the idea of a needle being plunged into her flesh was worse than an arrow slicing through her skin.</p><p>Ewan pressed his mouth to her shoulder and kept it there for a long moment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, lass, but it has to be done. The cut is too deep and too open for bandaging. The wound needs to be cleaned and closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you ... Will you stay with me?\u201d</p><p>He stroked his hand down her arm and then back up and over her shoulder to her cheek. He pushed her hair away from her face and then his hand cupped her nape.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here, Mairin.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean the healer isn\u2019t here?\u201d Ewan asked in disbelief.</p><p>Cormac had no lovfor telling his laird that the healer couldn\u2019t be fetched. The dread was there to read on his face.</p><p>\u201cFind our healer and bring her here,\u201d Ewan said through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cI cannot, Laird,\u201d Cormac said with a heavy sigh. \u201cThe MacLaurens lost their healer and Lorna went to help deliver the laird\u2019s babe. You gave her permission yourself.\u201d</p><p>Ewan blew out his breath in frustration. Of course he had. Lorna was a skilled midwife and MacLauren had sent a frantic appeal to Ewan for help when his laboring wife had failed to bring forth a babe in a timely manner. At the time, he\u2019d considered that if any of the McCabes needed the services of a healer, he himself would tend to the need.</p><p>Only now his wife needed stitching and it was God\u2019s truth he had no liking for the chore.</p><p>\u201cBring me ale, as strong as you can find,\u201d he murmured to Cormac. \u201cYou might need to ask Gertie where she stocks the blend we keep on hand for injuries and sedation. I need water, needle and thread, and something to bind her wound with. Be quick about it.\u201d</p><p>When Cormac left, Ewan turned back to Mairin, who lay on the bed, her eyes closed. She was unnaturally pale and it lent an even more delicate look to her features.</p><p>He shook his head at the direction of his thoughts. The wound wasn\u2019t serious. Certainly nothing she\u2019d die of. Provided he could prevent her from taking a fever.</p><p>Gannon and Diormid stood close to the bed, hovering anxiously. While Ewan waited for Cormac to bring the supplies, he turned to his men and spoke in low tones.</p><p>\u201cI want every person in the keep questioned. Someone must have seen something. I refuse to believe this was an accident. My men are far too careful. Find out who was practicing with bows and arrows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think someone tried to harm the lass?\u201d Gannon asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019d like to find out,\u201d Ewan said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure no one meant to kill me,\u201d Mairin said in a bleary voice. \u201c \u2019Twas an accident, that\u2019s all. You may tell your men I forgive them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do, Ewan?\u201d Caelen asked, his features drawn into a tight line.</p><p>\u201cRemain with me. I\u2019ll need help holding her.\u201d</p><p>Cormac rushed in, his arms full and his fingers clamped tight around a flask of ale. Ewan took the items from Cormac and set them next to the bed.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want anyone touching Mairin, but he also recognized the impossibility of him being able to do everything. If he was going to do the stitching\u2014and if the healer wasn\u2019t able to, no one else was going to do it but him\u2014then he\u2019d need one of the others to hold her steady and make sure he didn\u2019t do more damage than good.</p><p>He looked up at Cormac. \u201cGo make sure the children are all right. Make sure that Crispen is attended to. He\u2019ll worry when he hears what happened to Mairin. Have Maddie and the other women keep him below stairs until I am done.\u201d</p><p>Cormac bowed and hurried from the chamber, leaving Ewan and Caelen with Mairin.</p><p>Taking the flask in hand, Ewan sat on the bed close to Mairin\u2019s head and trailed a finger over her cheek.</p><p>\u201cLass, I need you to open your eyes and drink this.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids fluttered and her unfocused eyes found his. He helped her lean up enough so that she could put her lips to the opening. As soon as the liquid hit her mouth, she flinched away, her face drawn into an expression of intense dislike.</p><p>\u201cAre you poisoning me?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He held back the chuckle and put the flask close to her mouth again. \u201c \u2019Tis ale. You\u2019ll need it to help relax you. It will also help the pain.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lips and turned worried eyes back to him.</p><p>\u201cPain?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cAye, lass. Pain. I wish it weren\u2019t so, but the stitching up will cause you pain. If you drink this down, you won\u2019t feel as much. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou likely won\u2019t feel anything at all after a good taste of that stuff,\u201d Caelen muttered.</p><p>She wrinkled up her nose and sighed fatalistically as she allowed Ewan to put the ale to her mouth again. To her credit, she drank it down with only minimal gagging and choking. When he lowered the flask, her skin had a greenish hue that made him worry the ale would come back up with the least provocation.</p><p>\u201cDeep breaths,\u201d he said. \u201cIn through your nose. Let it settle.\u201d</p><p>She flopped back onto the pillow and promptly let out a very unladylike belch followed by a series of hiccups.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear that,\u201d she said.</p><p>Caelen arched an eyebrow and shot Ewan a look of amusement. \u201cHear what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Caelen,\u201d she said dramatically. \u201cYou aren\u2019t near as fierce as you look, though if you\u2019d smile on occasion, you\u2019d be quite handsome.\u201d</p><p>Caelen scowled at that.</p><p>Ewan waited several minutes and then leaned over to stare down at Mairin. \u201cHow do you feel, lass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful. Ewan, why are there two of you? I can assure you that one is entirely enough.\u201d</p><p>Ewan smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I? What am I ready for?\u201d</p><p>Ewan dipped one of the cloths into a basin of warm water that Cormac had prepared. After wringing it out, he carefully wiped the now drying blood from Mairin\u2019s side. It was only a graze, and in fact, it looked as though the arrow went right between her arm and her side as there was a bloody crease on the inside of her arm as well.</p><p>The arrow cut through more of her side, and it was that flesh that needed stitching.</p><p>He motioned for Caelen to take position on Mairin\u2019s other side. Caelen walked around the bed and carefully pulled her arm away so that her side was bared to Ewan.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to hold her,\u201d Ewan said patiently. \u201cI don\u2019t want her moving when I put the needle to her flesh.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, Caelen anchored her more firmly against his body and held her wrist so that she couldn\u2019t flail her arm.</p><p>Mairin roused and stared dumbly up at Caelen. \u201cCaelen, your laird will not be pleased to find you in his bed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Caelen rolled his eyes. \u201cI think he\u2019ll understand this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t,\u201d she said crossly. \u201cIt isn\u2019t decent. No one should see me in bed except the laird. Do you know what I told him?\u201d</p><p>Ewan raised one eyebrow. \u201cPerhaps \u2019tis best if you keep such matters to yourself, lass.\u201d</p><p>She ignored him and rambled on. \u201cI told him that he was unskilled at loving. I don\u2019t think he was pleased with that statement.\u201d</p> <p>Despite Ewan\u2019s glare, Caelen burst into laughter.</p><p>\u201cOh, it isn\u2019t polite to laugh at your laird,\u201d Mairin said in a solemn voice. \u201cBesides, \u2019tis not true. I was quite wrong.\u201d</p><p>Ewan moved a hand to cover her mouth so she wouldn\u2019t blurt out anything else in her drunken state. \u201cI think you\u2019ve said enough.\u201d</p><p>He ignored Caelen\u2019s amused look and signaled that he was ready to begin.</p><p>Caelen grimaced, and something remarkably like sympathy flashed in his eyes when Mairin jumped at the first prick of the needle.</p> <p>A whimper escaped from Mairin when he set the second stitch.</p><p>\u201cHurry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI will, lass, I will.\u201d</p><p>In battle his hand never shook. It remained steady around the sword. It had never failed him. Not once. Yet here, doing such a simple task as setting needle to skin, he had to call on every bit of his control to keep his fingers precise.</p><p>By the time he tightened the final stitch, Mairin shook uncontrollably beneath his hand. Caelen\u2019s fingers were white from the pressure he exerted on her shoulder, and y\"&gt;Ewas sure she\u2019d wear bruises.</p><p>\u201cLet her go,\u201d Ewan said in a quiet voice. \u201cI\u2019m finished.\u201d</p> <p>Caelen released her shoulder and Ewan waved him from the chamber. After Caelen closed the door behind him, Ewan reached down to touch Mairin\u2019s cheek only to find it wet with tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, lass. I\u2019m sorry it was necessary to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She opened her tightly closed eyes, and tears shimmered in the blue depths. \u201cIt didn\u2019t hurt overly much.\u201d</p><p>She was lying but he felt a surge of pride at her bravado.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get some rest now? I\u2019ll have Maddie bring you a tisane for the pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Ewan,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He leaned down and brushed a kiss across her brow. He waited until she\u2019d closed her eyes before he backed away and retreated from the chamber.</p><p>Outside the door, his demeanor swiftly changed from caretaker to warrior.</p> <p>He went in search of Maddie first and gave her instructions not to leave Mairin\u2019s bedside. Then he found Cormac, Diormid, and Gannon in the courtyard questioning his men.</p><p>\u201cHave you found anything yet?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWe still have the majority of the men to question, Laird. It\u2019ll take some time,\u201d Gannon said. \u201cThere were many men practicing archery, but no one can account for the errant shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is unacceptable. Someone struck Lady McCabe whether by accident or intent. I want that man.\u201d He turned to Diormid. \u201cWere you not supervising the archery? Can you not account for your men?\u201d</p><p>Diormid bowed his head. \u201cAye, Laird, I take full responsibility. Every one under me will be questioned at length. I will find the man responsible.\u201d</p><p>Ewan shook his head grimly. \u201cI will not have the children of this keep unprotected. \u2019Tis as Mairin says. They should have a safe place to play and be children without their mothers worrying that they\u2019ll be killed by a stray arrow. From now on, the children will play behind the keep on the hillside, far away from where the men train.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere they play now is plenty distant from the courtyard,\u201d Cormac said with a fierce frown. \u201cWhat happened today should not have occurred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, but it did,\u201d Ewan bit back. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to ever happen again. You will gather the men after the questioning. I want to address them.\u201d</p><p>It was well past midnight before Ewan trudged wearily up to his chamber. They\u2019d questioned every single clansman, even the children, and no one could recall seeing anything untoward. The men practicing archery swore that none of them was responsible, and yet the arrow had been a McCabe arrow. There was no doubt about that. Afterward, he\u2019d given his men a dressing down about being more careful in their training. If they couldn\u2019t keep the people of their own clan safe from themselves, how were they to protect them from outside threats?</p><p>Ewan let himself into his room, and Maddie stirred from her position by the fire.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Ewan asked in hushed tones.</p><p>Maddie rose and crept silently to stand in front of Ewan. \u201cShe\u2019s resting better now. She was in pain before, but after I gave her the tisane, she calmed and was able to rest better. I changed her dressing an hour past. The bleeding has stopped. You did a fine job stitching her, Laird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny sign of fever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. She\u2019s cool to the touch, just restless. I think she\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Maddie. You can retire to your cottage now. I appreciate you sitting with Mairin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was glad to do it, Laird. If you have need of anything else, send for me at once.\u201d</p><p>She bobbed a curtsy and then walked by him and out the door.</p><p>Ewan undressed and slipped into bed beside Mairin, careful not to jar her. As soon as his body touched hers, she stirred and snuggled into his arms like a warm kitten on a cold night. She uttered a deep sigh against his neck and proceeded to wrap her legs around his while throwing one arm over his body.</p><p>He smiled. She was a possessive thing in bed. She considered his body her territory and she had no compunction about laying claim whenever he got near. Not that he minded. In truth, there was something about having a warm, sweet lass wrapped around him that appealed to him more than he\u2019d ever thought possible.</p><p>He touched one strand of hair, allowing it to curl around the tip of his finger. He wasn\u2019t a man ruled by fear, but when he\u2019d realized that Mairin had been shot, he\u2019d experienced a wash of terror unlike anything he\u2019d ever known. The idea that he could have lost her didn\u2019t sit well with him.</p><p>He could make a lot of excuses, including the biggest, that if she died, Neamh \u00c1lainn would never be his. His clan would never be rebuilt. Revenge would never be his. All of those things were true. But the simplest truth was that he hadn\u2019t wanted to lose her. None of the other things had even crossed his mind when he\u2019d frantically examined her injuries.</p><p>Aye, the lass was getting under his skin. He\u2019d been right about her from the moment he\u2019d first laid eyes on her. She was definitely trouble.</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>When Mairin awoke, the pain in her head overshadowed the pain in her side. She licked over her cracked lips but it wasn\u2019t enough to rid herselfe horrible taste in her mouth.</p><p>What on earth had the laird done to her? All she remembered was him ordering her to drink some foul liquid and having to choke it down. Even the memory made her stomach lurch precariously.</p><p>She rolled, testing the tenderness in her side, but ran into a warm, snuggly body. She smiled and curled her arm around Crispen and hugged him tight.</p><p>He opened his eyes and snuggled closer to her bosom. \u201cAre you all right, Mama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, dearling, I\u2019m perfectly well. I hardly feel a pinch. \u2019Twas just a little cut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was scared.\u201d</p><p>His voice wavered and her heart squeezed at the uncertainty in his voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you were afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it hurt? Maddie told me that Papa had to stitch you up. I would think that would hurt a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, it did, but not overmuch. Your father had a good, steady hand and he was quick about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa is the best,\u201d Crispen said, with all the confidence a young boy has in his father. \u201cI knew he\u2019d take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Mairin smiled and kissed the top of his head. \u201cI have need to get out of this bed. I\u2019ve lain here so long that my muscles are all stiff and sore. Would you like to help me?\u201d</p><p>Crispen scrambled from the bed and then made a big show of aiding Mairin to her feet.</p><p>\u201cYou should go to your chamber and dress for the day. I\u2019ll meet you below stairs. Perhaps Gertie will have food for the both of us.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a huge grin and then scampered off, slamming the door behind him.</p><p>Mairin stretched as soon as he was gone, and winced. It truly wasn\u2019t bad. She hadn\u2019t told a lie. Just a twinge or two when she moved wrong. It certainly wasn\u2019t enough to keep her abed.</p><p>She turned to retrieve a gown from her wardrobe, when a flash of color caught her eye. Her gaze was drawn to the small table sitting near the window. On top of it lay a neatly folded pile of fabric.</p><p>It was her wedding dress. Forgetting all about her injury, she hurried over and delved her fingers into the sumptuous fabric. Then she yanked it upward and allowed the dress to unfold. Why, it was as good as new. There was no evidence of the rend.</p><p>She hugged the material to her chin and closed her eyes in delight. It was silly to be so emotional over a dress, but a woman only got married once, didn\u2019t she? She frowned. Well, most of the time. She wouldn\u2019t think on such matters as the laird dying and leaving her a widow.</p><p>She stroked the dress one last time, enjoying the softness as it glided over her fingers. Then she carefully put it away so it would keep until the next time she had an occasion to wear it.</p><p>em\"&gt;Eager to leave her chamber, she went about pulling her gown on, her gestures awkward as she tried to arrange the dress with as little movement on her left side as possible.</p><p>As best she could, she brushed out her hair and left it down, since braiding it was going to be an impossibility one-handed. When she was satisfied that she didn\u2019t look quite so haggard, she left the chamber, hoping she wasn\u2019t too late for the morning meal.</p><p>And it was high time she saw to her duties as mistress of the keep. Surely that would keep her out of trouble with Ewan.</p><p>The days since her wedding had passed in a blur, and other than making the acquaintance of other women in the clan, Mairin hadn\u2019t done much of anything besides trying to avoid her faithful watchdogs.</p><p>Well, enough of all that. It was time to take things in hand. After taking an arrow in the side, she wasn\u2019t enthused about venturing out of the keep anyway.</p><p>When she entered the hall, she was greeted with looks of horror from her clansmen. Gannon and Cormac were involved in a heated debate, but when they saw her, they broke off and stared as if she\u2019d grown two heads. Maddie, who was passing through as Mairin made her entrance, immediately threw up her hands and rushed over to where Mairin stood.</p><p>\u201cMy lady, you should still be abed,\u201d Gannon exclaimed as he and Cormac also hurried over.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Maddie agreed. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be up. I was about to bring up a tray for you to eat in bed.\u201d</p><p>Mairin raised her hands to silence them. \u201cI appreciate your concern. Truly, I do. But I\u2019m perfectly fine. Staying abed serves no purpose except to drive me daft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe laird won\u2019t like this,\u201d Cormac muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat has the laird to do with it?\u201d Mairin demanded. \u201cHe should be relieved to know I\u2019m back on my feet and ready to take on my duties as mistress of this keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should rest, lass,\u201d Maddie said soothingly, as she turned Mairin back in the direction of the stairs. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to aggravate your injury.\u201d</p><p>Mairin shook off Maddie\u2019s hand and turned back to the hall, only to run into Gannon.</p><p>\u201cNow, my lady, you should be abed,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she insisted. \u201cWhy, I don\u2019t feel a bit of pain. Well, maybe a twinge or two,\u201d she added when Cormac shot her a disbelieving look. \u201cBut \u2019tis no reason to stay in bed on such a fine day. I\u2019ll even allow you to accompany me,\u201d she said to both Gannon and Cormac.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll allow?\u201d Gannon asked with a scowl.</p><p>She nodded and smiled serenely. \u201cAye, I will. I\u2019ll be no trouble. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll believe that when I see it,\u201d Cormac muttered.</p><p>\u201cMaddie, I\u2019ve need of your assistance if you\u2019re willing to give it.\u201d</p><p>Maddie looked confused. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll help you, my lady, but I still think you should go above stairs and lie down. Perhaps you can tell me what it is you need assistance with, while you eat your meal in bed.\u201d</p><p>Mairin faced them all down and let her displeasure show. \u201cThere is absolutely no reason for me to go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is every reason, wife.\u201d</p><p>Cormac\u2019s and Gannon\u2019s shoulders sagged in relief while Maddie let out a sigh. Mairin turned to see her husband standing behind her, a look of mild annoyance on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhy is it I can\u2019t expect even the least bit of cooperation from you?\u201d</p><p>Mairin\u2019s mouth fell open. \u201cThat\u2019s ... That\u2019s ... well, that\u2019s quite a rude thing to say, Laird. You\u2019re implying I\u2019m difficult. I\u2019m not difficult.\u201d She whirled back around to face the others. \u201cAm I?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cormac looked like he\u2019d swallowed a bug while Gannon found something on the wall to study.

She laughed outright.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you in bed, Mairin?\u201d Ewan asked.</p><p>She turned back around to face him. \u201cI\u2019m quite well. I\u2019m feeling much more myself today. Well, except for the headache. What was it you made me drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething to make you more amenable. I\u2019m tempted to have Gertie prepare you another flask.\u201d</p> <p>She had no response to that.</p><p>\u201cCome above stairs with me so I can redress your wound,\u201d Ewan said, as he directed her toward the stairs. \u201cBut ... but I was about to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ewan propelled her up the steps. \u201cWhatever it was you were about to do can wait until I\u2019ve seen to your injury. If I\u2019m satisfied that you\u2019re truly well enough to be up and around, I\u2019ll reconsider your confinement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy confinement? That\u2019s the most ridiculous\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ewan stopped and before she could finish her tirade, he planted his mouth over hers in a scorching, toe-curling kiss. It wasn\u2019t a tender gesture. It was demanding ... and passionate, and Lord, she didn\u2019t want him to stop.</p> <p>When he pulled away she had a hard time regaining her senses. They were ... outside their chamber? She blinked as she tried to remember what brought them here.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that you were saying, lass?\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed. She opened her mouth then shut it again. \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and opened the door, pulling her inside the room. He started tugging at her dress and she batted his hands away.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t have you tearing another dress,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Ewan sighed. \u201cI had Maddie repair your gown. It was an accident.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou had my dress sewn?\u201d</p><p>His lips formed a thin line and he looked away, ignoring her question.</p><p>\u201cLaird, you saw to the repair of my dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201c \u2019Tis a woman\u2019s matter. Men don\u2019t concern themselves with women\u2019s fripperies.\u201d</p><p>Mairin smiled and then threw herself against Ewan\u2019s chest before he could ward her off with his hand. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, as she wrapped her arms around his waist.</p><p>Ewan let out a deep breath and pulled her away from his body, his gaze reproachful. \u201cLass, when are you going to demonstrate some restraint? You\u2019re going to upset your wound again, throwing yourself around like that.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at his stern face and then leaned up and palmed his face between her hands. Then she pulled him down into a breathless kiss that had her panting and gasping for air within seconds.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure who was more affected. She or he. His eyes glowed, and his nostrils flared as she rocked back onto her feet.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m really quite well, Ewan,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMother Serenity used to avow that God\u2019s hand was ever guiding me because no matter how hard I fell or how badly I hurt myself, I always bounced back with amazing speed. My side pains me, aye, but not overly much. \u2019Tis more of a nuisance than a true pain. There\u2019s no reason for me to stay in bed the entire day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemove your dress, Mairin. I\u2019d like to see for myself how you\u2019re healing.\u201d</p><p>With a disgruntled sigh, she loosened the strings of her bodice and carefully peeled away the material. From the corner of her eye, she saw Ewan\u2019s expression grow tight as he stared at her bare shoulders.</p><p>Fascinated by his intense regard, she took a little more time than necessary to ease the dress down her body. Her hair fell down her back and forward over her breasts. Just the nipples peeked through the strands, and Ewan\u2019s gaze was fixed on them.</p><p>\u201cShall I lie down?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>Ewan cleared his throat. \u201cAye. That\u2019s fine. Make yourself comfortable. This won\u2019t take but a minute.\u201d</p><p>She eased down on the bed but watched Ewan from underneath her lashes. While he was thon changing the dressing on her wound, his heated gaze dragged over the rest of her body, so tangible that it was like the brush of his hand over her skin.</p><p>She stirred restlessly as he finished tying the strip of cloth around her side. The action thrust her breasts forward, brushing against his arm. Her nipples immediately puckered, the rasp of hair over the sensitive tips sending a warm flood of pleasure deep into her body.</p><p>\u201cLass, \u2019tis not the time for loving,\u201d he whispered. \u201cBut you tempt me. Aye, you tempt me like no other.\u201d</p><p>She circled his neck with her arms and they stared at each other for a long, silent moment. His eyes were beautiful and they reminded her of the highland hills in the spring. So green and alive with life.</p><p>He lowered his mouth to hers, gently at first, just a simple pressing of mouths together. A gentle smooching sound, flesh meeting flesh. He kissed the corner of her mouth then returned to the middle and then over to catch the other corner.</p><p>\u201cYou taste of sunshine.\u201d</p><p>Her chest tightened, and pleasure at the sweet words filled her to bursting.</p><p>She could feel him between her legs, hard and pulsing. He strained at his trews, pushing impatiently. She wanted him. Aye, she wanted him badly.</p><p>\u201cEwan,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAre you sure \u2019tis not the time for loving?\u201d</p><p>He groaned low in his throat. \u201cAye, you\u2019re a temptress all right.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her body to fit it to his, unsure of what she was doing, but it felt right. She was hot and flushed and she needed something she was sure only he could give her.</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, I\u2019ll kiss you, lass. I\u2019ll kiss you until you beg me to stop.\u201d</p><p>His lips closed around one taut nipple and pulled as he sucked it farther into his mouth. His hands stroked her body and she arched like a contented cat seeking more of its master\u2019s touch.</p><p>\u201cEasy, lass,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>Hurt herself? She was going to hurt him if he didn\u2019t continue kissing her.</p><p>He slipped his hands between her thighs and thumbed through the tight curls guarding her sensitive flesh. He brushed over the quivering point even as his fingers sought her moist opening. Despite his warning, she arched helplessly, unable to control her frantic response.</p><p>Fire stoked deep within her body and fanned rapidly through her groin, tightening each time his fingers stroked inside. This wasn\u2019t how it was done, was it?</p><p>She didn\u2019t care. Whatever he was doing felt so wondrous that she wanted to beg him never to stop. And she did. Over and over, the words spilling out between fractured sobs.</p><p>t=\"0em\"&gt;</p><p>He sucked at each breast, alternating as he drove her mindless with his fingers. She was hot and slick around him and she was fast building to an explosive end.</p><p>She whimpered and gripped his shoulders as she raised her hips, wanting more. He added a second finger to her sheath at the precise moment his thumb exerted more pressure.</p><p>She would have screamed\u2014she did scream\u2014but he raised his mouth from her breast to capture her mouth just as she did and swallowed the savage cry as she came apart in his arms.</p><p>Forgotten was her wound, the bandage, any pain or discomfort. There was only wave after wave of intense pleasure until she sagged onto the bed, too limp and weak to do anything more than gasp for air.</p><p>He rolled to the side and carefully pulled her into his arms. His lips brushed over her hair and he stroked the tresses with one hand. He caressed and petted every inch of her skin until a wonderful haze surrounded her and enfolded her in its warm glow.</p><p>\u201cSleep, lass,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou need your rest.\u201d</p><p>Too fuzzy and sated to argue, she closed her eyes before she even realized she\u2019d done so. Her last coherent thought was that he was far superior to ale as a sleeping drought.</p><p>CHAPTER 21</p><p>Mairin let out a lusty yawn and stretched her arms over her head. She was so limber from her bout of loving with Ewan that her side didn\u2019t even pain her.</p><p>Then she realized that despite her determination to be out and about, she\u2019d spent half the day in her chamber. With a frown, she rose, grumbling under her breath about husbands and trickery.</p><p>He\u2019d done it apurpose, she was convinced of it. He\u2019d taken her to their chamber on the pretext of tending her wound and then distracted her with loving. And to think she\u2019d ever thought he wasn\u2019t skilled in such matters.</p><p>He was too skilled by far.</p><p>This time when she left her chamber, Gannon met her directly outside her door. She looked at him in astonishment as he picked himself up off the floor.</p><p>\u201cHave you been outside my door all afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, my lady. \u2019Tis my duty to see to your safety. You have a habit of disappearing, so Cormac and I drew straws to see who would safeguard the chamber door.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, not liking the idea that she was such a distasteful duty that they were forced to draw straws over the unpleasant task.</p><p>She headed toward the stairs, determined to see Maddie without any interference from her husband or her watch guards.</p><p>Cormac was in the hall sharing a tankard of ale with a few of the older men of the clan.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Crispen about?\u201d she called to Cormac.</p><p>\u201cNay, my lady. Last I knew of him, he was out playing with the other children. Would you like me to fetch him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh nay, let him play. I have no need of him at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Cormac rose and started in Mairin and Gannon\u2019s direction, but she held up her hand. \u201cI am only going to see Maddie. Gannon can escort me. Can\u2019t you, Gannon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, my lady. If \u2019tis all you\u2019re planning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. \u2019Tis getting on into the afternoon. \u2019Twill be dark soon enough.\u201d</p><p>Gannon relaxed. He nodded in Cormac\u2019s direction and then gestured for Mairin to precede him from the hall.</p><p>Mairin set out at a brisk pace, determined for anyone who saw her to think she was fully recovered from her accident. By the time she reached Maddie\u2019s cottage, she was winded and she leaned against the door for support as she sucked in air.</p><p>After recovering her breath, she knocked politely on the door and waited. She frowned when no response was forthcoming.</p><p>\u201cMaddie isn\u2019t in her cottage, my lady,\u201d one of the women sang out from one cottage down. \u201cShe\u2019s helping Gertie in the kitchens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Mairin called.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to go to the kitchens?\u201d Gannon asked politely.</p><p>The thought of encountering Gertie was enough to persuade Mairin she could wait to speak to Maddie. It wasn\u2019t as if she could do much of anything today anyway.</p><p>She turned in the direction of the keep and came to a stop and stared at the ruckus right in the middle of the path that split the cottages. Two older men were carrying on quite a spirited conversation, complete with shaking fists and fiercely worded threats.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth are they arguing about, Gannon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh \u2019tis nothing you need to worry over, my lady,\u201d Gannon said. \u201c \u2019Tis only Arthur and Magnus.\u201d</p><p>He tried to steer her down the path, but she remained rooted to her spot as the men\u2019s voices grew louder.</p><p>\u201cQuit yer shouting you old goats!\u201d</p><p>Mairin blinked in surprise at the woman leaning out her window hollering at the two men. Arthur and Magnus paid her no mind and continued their argument. It quickly became clear to Mairin that the dispute centered around the mare that stood between the two men, looking quite unimpressed with the goings-on.</p><p>\u201cWho does the mare belong to?\u201d Mairin whispered. \u201cAnd why do they argue so fiercely over it?\u021d</p><p>Gannon sighed. \u201c \u2019Tis an old argument, my lady. And they do enjoy a good argument. If it wasn\u2019t the mare, it would be something else.\u201d</p><p>One of the men turned and started to stomp down the path, shouting all the way that he was going straight to the laird.</p><p>Thinking quickly, Mairin stepped in his way and he pulled up just short of running right over her.</p><p>\u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, lass! Now step aside, if you please. I have business with the laird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be respectful and mind your tongue, Arthur,\u201d Gannon growled. \u201c \u2019Tis your mistress you address.\u201d</p><p>Arthur narrowed his eyes and then cocked his head to the side. \u201cAye, so it is. Shouldn\u2019t you be abed after your mishap?\u201d</p><p>Mairin heaved a sigh. The news was all over the keep, no doubt. She had no desire to appear weak when she assumed her duties as mistress. She was already mentally calculating all that needed to be done. With or without Maddie\u2019s aid, it was time she stepped into the running of the keep.</p><p>\u201cStep aside,\u201d Magnus declared. \u201cYou have the manners of a jackass, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at Mairin then and offered a sweeping bow. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been properly introduced. My name\u2019s Magnus McCabe.\u201d</p><p>Mairin returned his smile and was sure to include Arthur, lest he use that as an excuse to start another argument.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t help but overhear you arguing over the mare,\u201d she began hesitantly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Arthur snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s because Magnus has a mouth the size of a mountain.\u201d</p><p>Mairin held up a hand. \u201cRather than trouble your laird over such an inconsequential matter, perhaps I can be of help.\u201d</p><p>Magnus rubbed his hands together and cast a triumphant glance in Athur\u2019s direction. \u201cThere, you see? The lass will determine who has the right of it.\u201d</p><p>Arthur rolled his eyes and didn\u2019t look impressed with Mairin\u2019s offer.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no right or wrong of it,\u201d Arthur said matter-of-factly. \u201cThe mare is mine. Always has been. Gannon knows.\u201d</p><p>Gannon closed his eyes and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Mairin said. Then she looked at Magnus. \u201cYou dispute Arthur\u2019s claim to the mare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said emphatically. \u201cTwo months past, he became enraged because the mare bit him on the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no need to say where she bit me,\u201d Arthur hastily broke in. \u201c \u2019Tis sufficient to say she bit me. Th in Athur&amp;2019;s all that\u2019s important.\u201d</p> <p>Magnus leaned in and whispered. \u201cShe bit him on the arse, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went wide. Gannon issued a sharp reprimand to Magnus for speaking to his mistress in such an indelicate fashion, but Magnus didn\u2019t look the least repentant.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, once the mare bit Arthur, he became so enraged that he turned her loose, slapped her on the flanks, and told the ungrateful ...\u201d He stopped and cleared his throat. \u201cWell, he told her not to bother ever returning. It was cold out and raining, you see. I took the mare in, dried her, and gave her some oats. So you see, the mare belongs to me. Arthur relinquished all claim to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady, the laird has already heard their complaint,\u201d Gannon whispered to her.</p><p>\u201cAnd what did the laird decide?\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>\u201cHe told them to work it out between themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Mairin made a sound of exasperation. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t particularly helpful.\u201d</p><p>This would be as good a starting point as any to assert her authority and show her clan that she was a worthy mate to their laird. Ewan was a busy man, and matters such as this should be settled without pulling him into a petty argument.</p><p>She turned back to the men, who\u2019d begun bickering again. She held up her hands for silence, and when that didn\u2019t work, she put her fingers between her lips and issued a sharp whistle.</p><p>Both men flinched and turned to stare at her in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cA lady doesn\u2019t whistle,\u201d Arthur reprimanded.</p><p>\u201cAye, he\u2019s right, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so now the two of you are prepared to agree on something,\u201d Mairin muttered. \u201cIt was the only way to quiet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted something?\u201d Magnus asked.</p> <p>She folded her hands neatly in front of her, satisfied that she had the perfect plan to solve the argument.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have Gannon cut the mare in half and give you each an equal portion. \u2019Tis the only fair way to go about it.\u201d</p><p>Arthur and Magnus stared at her then looked at each other. Gannon closed his eyes again and didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s daft,\u201d Arthur said.</p><p>Magnus nodded. \u201cThe poor laird. He must have been tricked. He\u2019s married a daft lass.\u201d</p><p>Mairin put her hands on her hips. \u201cI am not daft!\u201d</p><p>Arthur shook his head, a light of sympathy in his eyes. \u201cMaybe daft is too strong a word. Addled. Aye, maybe ee addled. Did you suffer an injury to your head recently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, I did not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a child then?\u201d Magnus asked.</p><p>\u201cI am in perfect command of my faculties,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cThen why in God\u2019s name did you suggest we cut the mare in two?\u201d Arthur demanded. \u201cThat\u2019s the most daft thing I\u2019ve ever heard of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt worked for King Solomon,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cKing Solomon ordered a horse cut in half?\u201d Magnus asked in a confused voice.</p><p>\u201cWho is King Solomon? He\u2019s not our king. I bet he\u2019s English. \u2019Twould be a very English thing to do,\u201d Arthur said.</p><p>Magnus nodded in agreement. \u201cAye, all English are daft.\u201d Then he turned to Mairin. \u201cBe you English, lass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay! Why on earth would you ask something like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she has some English blood,\u201d Arthur said. \u201c \u2019Twould explain things.\u201d</p><p>She gripped her head and felt the sudden, violent urge to pull out her hair by the roots.</p><p>\u201cKing Solomon suggested a baby be cut in half when two women both claimed to be its mother.\u201d</p><p>Even Gannon looked appalled. Magnus and Arthur gaped at her and then shook their heads.</p><p>\u201cAnd the English claim we\u2019re barbarians,\u201d Arthur grumbled.</p><p>\u201cKing Solomon wasn\u2019t English,\u201d she said patiently. \u201cAnd the point was that the real mother would be so horrified over the thought of her baby being killed that she would give the baby to the other mother to spare the child\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>She looked pointedly at them, hoping they\u2019d understand the moral, but they still stared at her as if she\u2019d spewed a litany of blasphemies.</p><p>\u201cOh, never mind,\u201d she snapped. She stalked forward, grabbed the reins from an astonished Magnus, and pulled the hapless mare along as she headed back toward the keep.</p><p>\u201cMy lady, what are you doing?\u201d Gannon hissed, as he jogged to keep up with her.</p><p>\u201cHey, she\u2019s stealing our horse!\u201d Magnus cried.</p><p>\u201cOur horse? \u2019Tis my horse, you dolt.\u201d</p><p>She ignored the two men as they began bickering all over again.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis clear that neither one of them deserves the poor horse,\u201d Mairin said. \u201cI\u2019ll take her to Ewan. He\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d</p><p>Gannon\u2019s expression told her he had no love of taking the horse to his laird. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Gannon. I\u2019ll tell him you tried to stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will?\u201d</p><p>The hopeful tone in his voice amused her.</p><p>She stopped in the middle of the courtyard, suddenly aware that there were no men training and no sign of Ewan.</p><p>\u201cWell, where is he?\u201d she asked in exasperation. \u201cOh, never mind,\u201d she said when Gannon failed to immediately respond. \u201cI\u2019ll take the horse to your stable master. You do have a stable master, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, my lady, we most certainly do, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint me in the direction of the stables then,\u201d she said before he could continue. \u201cI really should have familiarized myself with everything on the McCabe lands by now. I\u2019ve been around the keep and to the women\u2019s cottages but beyond that I\u2019m frightfully ignorant. Tomorrow we\u2019ll rectify that.\u201d</p><p>Gannon blinked. \u201cWe will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, we will. Now, the stables?\u201d</p><p>Gannon sighed and pointed across the courtyard to a pathway leading beyond the stone skirt that sheltered the courtyard. Mairin set off again, leading the mare past the wall.</p><p>She followed the worn path until she reached the far side of the keep where she saw an old structure that she assumed must be the stables. There was new wood framing the doorway, but there were also places that looked scorched by an old fire. The roof had been patched and looked to be sturdy enough to hold out the rain and snow.</p><p>She was annoyed to see Magnus and Arthur standing in front of the archway that led into the area where the laird\u2019s horses were cared for. They watched her warily as she approached, and she scowled to show them the full force of her displeasure.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting the horse back,\u201d she bellowed. \u201cI\u2019m giving the horse to the stable master so she\u2019ll be cared for appropriately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am the stable master, you daft lass,\u201d Arthur bellowed back.</p><p>\u201cYou will address your mistress with respect,\u201d Gannon roared.</p><p>Mairin gaped at Arthur and then turned to Gannon. \u201cStable master? This ... This ... cretin is the stable master?\u201d</p><p>Gannon sighed. \u201cI tried to tell you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Mairin sputtered. \u201cHe has as much business running a stable as I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do a fine job,\u201d Arthur snapped. \u201cAnd I\u2019d do it a lot better if I wasn\u2019t having to chase down people who steal my horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re relieved of duty, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t relieve me of duty!\u201d Arthur screeched. \u201cOnly the laird can do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the mistress of this keep and I say you\u2019ve been relieved,\u201d Mairin said belligerently. She turned to Gannon. \u201cTell him.\u201d</p><p>Gannon looked a little uncertain, but he stood behind his mistress. She nodded approvingly as Gannon informed the older man that he\u2019d indeed been relieved of duty.</p><p>Arthur stomped away muttering all manner of blasphemies while Magnus looked on with a smug smile.</p><p>\u201cIs it any wonder the horse bit him on the arse?\u201d Mairin muttered as Arthur disappeared.</p><p>She handed the reins to Gannon. \u201cWill you put her into a stall and make sure she\u2019s fed?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring Gannon\u2019s disgruntled look, she turned to head back in the direction of the keep. She was quite pleased with herself. She\u2019d not only managed to escape the confines of the keep without running into her husband, but she\u2019d also handled a difficult situation. Her first duty as mistress of the keep. She smiled and hurried up the steps and entered the great hall.</p><p>She waved at Cormac on her way through. \u201cI\u2019m just going up to change for the evening meal. Gannon will be along shortly. He\u2019s taking care of a horse for me.\u201d</p><p>Cormac rose, his brow creased in confusion. \u201cA horse?\u201d</p><p>Mairin fairly skipped up the stairs. The day hadn\u2019t been a complete waste. In fact, it had been quite lovely. And she was making strides in her bid to take an active part in the keep\u2019s activities. Why, she\u2019d made a decision and hadn\u2019t even bothered Ewan over such a trivial matter. It was the least she could do. He had many important duties and the more she could smooth things for him, the more he\u2019d be able to concentrate on those duties.</p><p>She splashed water on her face and brushed the dust from her dress. Aye, it had been a good day, and her wound wasn\u2019t even paining her.</p><p>\u201cMairin!\u201d</p><p>She flinched as the laird\u2019s roar carried all the way up the stairs and through her chamber door. He bellowed loud enough to shake the rafters.</p><p>With a shake of her head, she picked up her brush and made quick work of the tangles in her hair. If maneuvering her left arm didn\u2019t prick at her side, she\u2019d take the time to braid her hair. Maybe by morning.</p><p>\u201cMairin, present yourself at once!\u201d</p><p>She dropped her brush and scowled. Lord, but the man was impatient. After one more pat of her dress she headed down the stairs. When she rounded the corner into the hall, she saw Ewan standing in the middle of the room, arms crossed over his chest, a deep scowl etched around his mouth.</p><p>To the side stood Arthur and Magnus along with Gannon and Caelen. A few of Ewan\u2019s men tarried around the tables, having taken a keen interest in the fuss.</p><p>She came to a stop in front of Ewan and smiled demurely up at him. \u201cYou summoned me, Laird?\u201d</p><p>Ewan\u2019s scowl deepened. Then he ran a hand through his hair and looked heavenward. \u201cIn the course of the last hour, you\u2019ve stolen a man\u2019s horse and somehow managed to leave me without a stable master. Would you care to explain yourself, lass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI settled a dispute,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when I discovered that this odious man who clearly abuses his horses was responsible for your horses, Laird, I remedied the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had no authority to do either,\u201d Ewan said tightly. \u201cYour duties are quite simple. Obey me and don\u2019t interfere with the running of this keep.\u201d</p><p>Hurt squeezed her chest. Humiliation tightened her cheeks as she looked from man to man. She saw sympathy in Gannon\u2019s expression, but in Caelen\u2019s she saw agreement.</p><p>Not trusting that she wouldn\u2019t further humiliate herself, she turned away and walked rigidly back out of the hall.</p><p>\u201cMairin!\u201d Ewan roared.</p><p>She ignored him and increased her pace. She bypassed the stairs and slipped out of one of the doorways leading to the outside.</p><p>Odious, impossible, infuritating. All of them. They accused her of being daft, but this was the daftest clan she\u2019d ever come across.</p><p>Tears burned her eyes, and she angrily dashed them away. Dusk had fallen over the keep, blanketing it in hues of lavender and gray. The chill nipped at her but she paid no heed, as she hurried across the empty courtyard.</p><p>One of the guards on the wall called a warning to her but she waved him off and told him she had no intention of going far. She just needed to be away. Away from Ewan\u2019s roaring and the censure in his eyes.</p><p>She kept in line with the wall of the keep, making sure to remain inside the stone skirt. There had to be a place somewhere that afforded privacy while still offering safety.</p><p>Her solution came in the form of the old bathhouses in the rear of the keep. There was even a bench in the shell of the stone walls. She ducked under a sagging doorway and settled herself on the bench that lined the only wall still standing in its entirety. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally, a place away from the rest of the clan where she could have a private weep and lament her husband\u2019s disgraceful behavior.</p><p>CHAPTER 22</p><p>It was important that Ewan not go chasing after his wife, especially in front of his men. It was obvious the lass had no idea what she\u2019d gottenself into. He\u2019d give her time to cool down and then he would instruct her on the way of things.</p><p>He turned back to the men who stood behind him. Gertie was already putting the evening meal on the table, and judging by the smell, it had been a good hunting day for the men assigned to bring fresh meat into the keep.</p> <p>\u201cDo I have my position back, Laird?\u201d Arthur asked.</p><p>Ewan nodded wearily. \u201cAye, Arthur. You\u2019ve a fine hand with the horses. However, I\u2019ve had enough of your incessant bickering with Magnus, and \u2019tis obvious that it upsets your mistress.\u201d</p><p>Arthur didn\u2019t look happy but he nodded and hurried away to take his seat. Magnus looked as though he wanted to make a jibe at Arthur but Ewan\u2019s fierce scowl stopped him. He, too, took his seat\u2014at a table over from where Arthur had sat.</p><p>Ewan took his seat and was followed by his men. When Maddie made her way by to fill his trencher, he stopped her.</p><p>\u201cWhen you are finished serving the men, take a tray up to your mistress. She\u2019s in her chamber, and I don\u2019t want her to miss the evening meal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, Laird, I\u2019ll see to it immediately.\u201d</p><p>Satisified that his wife wouldn\u2019t go hungry and that, for the moment, all arguing was done, he dove into his portion, savoring the taste of the fresh venison.</p><p>By letting Mairin get over her upset, chances were that by the time he retired to their chamber, the initial storm would be over. He congratulated himself for his brilliant analysis and had a second helping of the stew.</p><p>A half hour later, however, when Maddie hurried into the hall to tell him that his wife was not in their chamber, he realized that his mistake was believing anything would be simple when it came to his impulsive wife.</p><p>She made him feel incompetent, and that his efforts to keep her safe were haphazard at best. None of that was true, but it raised his ire because he hadn\u2019t felt a moment of self-doubt since he was a lad. He could train and lead an entire army. He could win a battle when he was outnumbered five to one. But he couldn\u2019t keep a slip of a lass under control. It defied all reason and was making him daft in the process.</p><p>He pushed away from the table and stalked in the direction that Mairin had left. It was obvious she hadn\u2019t gone up the stairs, so he continued past to the doorway leading outside the keep.</p> <p>\u201cHave you seen your mistress?\u201d he called to Rodrick who was up on the wall.</p><p>\u201cAye, Laird. She came by half hour past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where is she now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the bathhouses. Gregory and Alain are watching over her. She\u2019s having a good cry, but otherwise, she is well.\u201d</p><p>Ewan winced and heaved a sigh. He much preferred her spitting like an angry kitten \"0em\"&gt;female tears and even less experience in dealing with them.</p><p>He went in the direction of the bathhouses. Gregory and Alain were standing outside one of the walls and they looked vastly relieved when Ewan strode up.</p><p>\u201cThank goodness you\u2019re here, Laird. You must make her stop. She\u2019s going to take ill with so much crying,\u201d Alain said.</p><p>Gregory frowned. \u201cIt isn\u2019t right for a lass to cry so much. Whatever it is you have to promise her, please do so. She\u2019s going to drown herself!\u201d</p> <p>Ewan held up a hand. \u201cThank you for your protection. You can go now. I\u2019ll see to your mistress.\u201d</p><p>They did a sorry job of hiding their obvious relief. As they left, Ewan heard the light sniffles that came from the inside of the bathhouses. Damn, but he hated the idea of her crying.</p><p>He stepped inside the dark interior and glanced around, blinking to adjust to the darkness. He followed the sounds of the sniffling until he found her sitting on a bench along the far wall. She was partially silhouetted by a sliver of moonlight that crept in through the narrow window carved into the stone, and he could see that her head was bowed, her shoulders slumped forward.</p><p>\u201cGo away.\u201d Her muffled voice filtered through the crumbling bathhouse.</p><p>\u201cAh, lass,\u201d he said as he sat beside her on the bench. \u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crying,\u201d she said in a voice that clearly indicated she was.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis a sin to lie,\u201d he offered, knowing it would get her back up.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis a sin to do nothing but yell at your wife, too,\u201d she said mournfully. \u201cYou promised to cherish me, aye, you did, but \u2019tis God\u2019s truth I don\u2019t feel very cherished.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cMairin, you sorely try my patience. I imagine you\u2019ll continue to exasperate me for years to come. I can tell you this won\u2019t be the only time I yell at you. If I told you differently I\u2019d be lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou embarrassed me in front of your men,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cIn front of that cretin stable master. He\u2019s a toad and shouldn\u2019t be allowed near a horse.\u201d</p><p>Ewan touched her cheek and brushed a long strand behind her ear so he could better see her face. He winced when he felt the dampness of her skin.</p><p>\u201cListen to me, sweeting. Arthur and Magnus have been arguing in one form or fashion since before I was born. The day they stop arguing will be the day we lay them in the ground. They came to me about the horse, but I refused to render a judgment because it kept them focused on the horse. If I gave it to one or the other, then they\u2019d find something else to argue over, and at least the horse is harmless enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took it away from the both of them,\u201d she said. \u201cShe may be old but she deserves better than to be argued over by two daft old men.\u201d</p><p>Ewan chuckled. \u201cAye, they told me you stole their horse and that you relieved Arthur of his duties.\u201d</p><p>Mairin twisted in her seat and latched on to Ewan\u2019s hand with her own. \u201cHow can that deplorable man be your stable master? Why, Ewan, he put his own horse into the cold without food or shelter. You would trust such a man with your own steed? A horse you would go into battle with?\u201d</p><p>Ewan smiled at her vehemence. She was a fierce little thing. She\u2019d already come to view his keep as her home and she was taking over with quite the militant attitude.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your determination to ensure we have the best possible care for my horses. But the truth is, Arthur is a magician with horses. Aye, he\u2019s hostile and argumentative and he\u2019s not very respectful, but he\u2019s old and he\u2019s been the stable master since my father was laird. He didn\u2019t mistreat his mare, lass. I would have taken a whip to him myself if that was the case. \u2019Twas the story he told to save face after the horse took a bite out of his backside. He\u2019s a complete lamb when it comes to the horses. They\u2019re his babies, although he\u2019d die before admitting so. He cares more for them than for any other living thing.\u201d</p><p>Mairin\u2019s shoulders slumped and she looked down at her feet. \u201cI made a fool of myself, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, lass.\u201d</p><p>She twisted her fingers in her lap. \u201cI just wanted to fit in here. Be a part of a clan. I wanted to have duties. I wanted my clan to respect me, come to me with their troubles. I used to dream of having a home and a family. Not a day went by at the abbey that I didn\u2019t imagine what it would be like to live free of fear and to be able to go my own way.\u201d</p><p>She chanced a look up at him, and he could see the vulnerability shining in her eyes. \u201cThat was all just a dream, wasn\u2019t it, Ewan?\u201d</p><p>His heart turned over in his chest. It was true he hadn\u2019t given much thought to her circumstances and how they\u2019d affected her. For all of her adult life, she\u2019d been sequestered at an abbey with only nuns for company and guidance. She\u2019d grown to expect that her life would be hard and uncertain when all she wanted was freedom and someone to cherish her.</p><p>So much of her actions and disregard for his authority made sense now. It wasn\u2019t as though she set out to blatantly ignore his commands. She was merely feeling her way around and reveling in the first taste of home and family she\u2019d ever experienced. She was spreading her wings and flexing her muscles for the first time ever.</p><p>He gathered her in his arms and squeezed affectionately. \u201cNay, lass, it wasn\u2019t a dream. \u2019Tis no less than you should expect from your new home and clan. You\u2019re still finding your way. You\u2019ll make mistakes and so will I. This is new for both of us. I propose a bargain. You be patient with me and I promise to try not to yell so much.\u201d</p><p>She went quiet for a moment and then she turned her chin up until she looked at him again. \u201cThat seems fair. I apologize for interfering in things that were not my concern. You were right. \u2019Tisn\u2019t my place.\u201d</p><p>The hurt and defeat in her voice stirred something deep within him. \u201cLass, look at me,\u201d he said gently, as he tipped her chin upward with his fingers. \u201cThis is your home and your clan. You are mistress here and as such your authority is second only to mine. I plan for you to have many years to look forward to making this your home and a place you\u2019re comfortable with. There\u2019s no need to have everything done in a day.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cold, lass. Come back inside the keep so I can warm you properly.\u201d</p><p>As he\u2019d hoped, his words made her stir restlessly against him. To give her added incentive, he fused his lips to hers, his heat melting her cold mouth. Ice against fire. In moments, she was returning his kiss with lusty, hot, open-mouthed kisses of her own. Lord, but the lass was a quick study in the art of kissing and using tongues.</p><p>He\u2019d spend a lifetime of being indecent in her eyes if she\u2019d only continue kissing him thusly.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he said haggardly. \u201cBefore I take you right here and now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lesson in sinning, Laird,\u201d she said in her prim, disapproving voice.</p><p>He grinned and chucked her cheek in an affectionate manner. \u201cAye, that may be true, lass, but you\u2019re no saint yourself.\u201d</p><p>Mairin watched her husband as she ate the food that Maddie delivered after Mairin and Ewan retired to their chamber. He looked deceptively lazy, sprawled on the bed, hands behind his head and legs crossed at the ankle.</p><p>He\u2019d stripped to just his trews, and she found it hard to concentrate on her food when he was lying there looking so blasted appealing.</p><p>As she downed the last of her food, her conversation with Maddie came to mind. She ducked her head, sure that Ewan would see the blush rising on her face, and she had no desire to tell him her thoughts. Not when they were so deliciously indecent.</p><p>But now that the thought had stuck in her mind, she studied him from the corner of her eye and wondered if she had the nerve to do as Maddie had described. It stood to reason that if he could make her so mindless with his mouth, the reverse would also be true.</p><p>\u201cAre you finished yet, wife?\u201d Ewan drawled.</p><p>She glanced down at the empty trencher and slowly set it aside. Aye, this was indeed the perfect time to try her wiles. She nearly giggled at the idea of her having wiles. Mother Serenity would be most stern over such a thought.</p><p>Not wanting to seem too obvious, she took her time preparing for bed. She undressed with a great deal more care than she usually exerted, her every movement slow and sensual. Twice she peeked to the side to see Ewan watche was lher, his eyes dark and hooded.</p><p>When she was completely nude, she sashayed to the basin of water and made a great production of washing. She turned to the side to give Ewan a good view of her profile, and she heard him suck in his breath when her nipples puckered in the wake of the damp cloth.</p><p>Having worked up the sufficient courage and having had enough time to formulate her plan, she tossed aside the cloth and moved toward the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still clothed, husband,\u201d she murmured as she stood over him.</p><p>Though he still wore his trews, they did nothing to disguise the bulge between his legs. He was hard and getting harder with every passing second.</p><p>\u201cAye, lass, but I can remedy that.\u201d</p><p>He started to push upward, but she reached down and pressed a hand to his chest.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis my duty to undress you.\u201d</p><p>He settled back onto the bed as her fingers went to the laces of his trews. As soon as she loosened them sufficiently, his erection jutted upward. She wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d ever get used to his size. And she couldn\u2019t even fathom how she\u2019d get it in her mouth, but Maddie seemed sure that it was done by plenty of women.</p><p>When she had trouble tugging the material over his hips, he lifted them and his hands covered hers as he helped push it down his legs.</p><p>When he would have sat up, she once again pushed him down, only this time she followed him down, until her lips were a mere breath from his.</p><p>She kissed him, enjoying the feel of his mouth beneath hers. Her hands wandered over his chest, and she marveled at how hard and solid he was. The roughness of his scars contrasted with the bristle of the hair underneath her palms. His nipples puckered and hardened under her touch and she went back, rubbing over them again, fascinated by the reaction that was similar to her own. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you about, lass?\u201d he murmured against her mouth.</p><p>She smiled and nuzzled his jaw and kissed her way down to his neck just like he\u2019d done to her. Judging by the sudden tension in his body, he liked it every bit as much as she had.</p><p>\u201cI have a theory,\u201d she whispered as she hovered just over one flat nipple. Then she flicked her tongue out and licked the point until it hardened and jutted outward.</p><p>Ewan groaned. \u201cWhat is your theory, lass?\u201d</p> <p>Placing both hands on his chest, she trailed her tongue down his midline until it dipped into his navel. He flinched and arched upward, his erection prodding at her side.</p><p>\u201cMy theory is that men might enjoy being kissed ... down there ... as much as women enjoy a man\u2019s mouth ... down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh hell,\u201d Ewan gasped out.</p><p>She curled her hand around his thick manhood and tucked the head between her lips.</p><p>He sounded like a man taking in his last breaths of life. His body was so tense and bowed that he resembled a wooden beam. His hands flew to the bed and gripped the linens. Oh aye, he liked it.</p> <p>Emboldened by his obvious enjoyment, she took him deeper, running her hand up and down the shaft as she sucked him farther into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cMairin,\u201d he gasped. \u201cOh sweet heaven, lass. Have mercy.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and lowered her fingers to stroke his swollen sac. He arched his hips, thrusting even as she took him as deep as she could. He was impossibly hard, so turgid that she wondered how he didn\u2019t split his skin.</p><p>He throbbed in her hand, hard, yet velvety soft, like a steel sword encased in silk.</p><p>\u201cLass, I can\u2019t take much more. You need to stop before I spill in your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Still gripping him in her hand, she raised her head so she could look into his eyes. Her hair fell forward and he reached up to smooth it from her face, his palm cradling her cheek as he did so.</p> <p>\u201cWould you like to spill in my mouth?\u201d she asked shyly.</p><p>\u201cAh, Mairin, that\u2019s like asking a dying man if he wants to live.\u201d</p><p>She cupped his face between her hands and lowered her mouth to kiss him. Long and sweet, she licked over his lips and dove inside, brushing her tongue over his, tasting him and teasing.</p><p>\u201cI like the idea of tasting you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He cupped her breasts, and as she pulled away, he raised the mounds and lifted his head so that he could feast on her nipples. She leaned heavily on him, her knees weak and shaking under the onslaught. If she gave him half a chance, he\u2019d turn the tables on her seduction.</p><p>She pulled away but softened her withdrawal with another kiss, and then she kissed another path down his chest, to his firm belly and then beyond to the nest of hair where his erection jutted hard and bold.</p><p>She licked first, tracing the bulging vein on the underside of the thick shaft. When she reached the head, there was already a droplet of liquid seeping from the slit. She lapped gently, sipping at the slightly salty taste of him.</p><p>Ewan\u2019s breath escaped in one long hiss, and when she lowered her mouth down his length, he seemed to lose all of his carefully cultivated control.</p> <p>He writhed on the bed, his movements desperate and unmeasured. She held him tight, using her tongue to drive him wild. His hand closed around hers and he pulled upward, his grip tightening as he worked her hand up and down. Realizing what it was he wanted her to do, she began to move her hand in rhythm with her mouth.</p><p>\u201cAh, lass, like that. Just like that,\u201d he moaned.</p><p>His hand tangled in her hair and then gripped the base of her neck, holding her as his hips hammered upward. She took him to the back of her throat and then hot liquid exploded onto her tongue, filling her mouth in a seemingly unending stream.</p><p>It was the most erotic thing she could have ever imagined, and never could she have thought that something so course and basic could have excited her beyond measure, but loving her husband in this fashion drove her as wild as it did him.</p><p>She felt powerful and equal, like she could give him every bit as much as he gave her.</p><p>He collapsed on the bed and slipped from her mouth. She swallowed the last of his passion and wiped at her lips with the back of her hand. His breaths came ragged and harsh and his gaze slid hotly over her as his chest heaved up and down.</p><p>\u201cCome here, lass,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>He pulled her down on top of him so that their bodies fused, warm and sweaty. He wrapped his arms around her and held her tight as he pressed a kiss to her hair.</p><p>Remembering Maddie\u2019s assertion that men were much more amenable after loving, Mairin lifted her head until her hair drapped over his chest.</p><p>\u201cEwan?\u201d</p><p>His hands smoothed over her shoulders and down to cup her buttocks. He squeezed and kneaded gently as he stared up into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAye, lass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like your promise,\u201d she said.</p><p>He cocked his head to the side. \u201cWhat are you wanting me to promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize we\u2019re newly married and I don\u2019t fully know the way of things, but I\u2019ve discovered I\u2019m a very possessive woman. I want your promise that you\u2019ll be faithful. I know \u2019tis common for some men to keep a leman\u2014\u201d</p><p>She was interrupted by Ewan\u2019s scowl. Then he sighed.</p><p>\u201cLass, you\u2019ve just thoroughly worn me out. Do you mind telling me how on earth I\u2019d have the energy to bed another woman?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. That wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d wanted to hear.</p><p>He sighed again. \u201cMairin, I took vows. I didn\u2019t take them lightly. As long as you prove a good and faithful wife, there\u2019s no reason for me to seek out another woman. I wouldn\u2019t dishonor you or myself that way. Your loyalty is to me, aye, but my loyalty is to you and any children you bear me. I take my responsibilities very seriously.\u201d</p><p>Tears crowded her eyes and she leaned down until their foreheads touched. \u201cI\u2019ll be faithful to you as well, Ewan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou damned well better,\u201d he growled. \u201cI\u2019ll kill any man who touches you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid9;ve disc like me kissing you ... down there ...?\u201d</p><p>He grinned and raised his lips to smooch hers. \u201cI liked it very much. I may require you to kiss me there every single night before we retire.\u201d</p><p>She frowned and punched him in the gut. He laughed and sucked inward in mock agony. He grabbed her wrists and rolled, careful not to jar her side. When they were on their sides, locked together, their faces so close she could feel his breath, he touched her cheek and rubbed with the back of his knuckle.</p><p>\u201cAnd now, lass, I\u2019m thinking I have some kissing of my own to do. Complete with tongue.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in her breath until she saw spots dancing in her vision. \u201cTongue? Have I told you lately how indecent your tongue is, Laird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t get any more indecent than yours just got,\u201d he said.</p><p>Then he proceeded to show her that indeed, he was far, far more indecent than she could ever dream of being.</p><p>CHAPTER 23</p><p>Ewan woke to a heavy pounding on his chamber door. Before he could rouse himself enough to answer the summons, the door burst open. Ewan was out of bed in the next instant, his hand on the floor and around the hilt of his sword.</p><p>\u201cJesu, Ewan, \u2019tis just me,\u201d Caelen said. \u201cYou were sleeping the sleep of the dead.\u201d</p><p>Ewan sat back on the bed and first pulled the furs up to shield Mairin\u2019s nudity and then to shield his own. \u201cGet the hell out of here,\u201d he said irritably.</p><p>\u201cIf my presence offends your maidenly modesty, I\u2019ll turn my back until you dress,\u201d Caelen said.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis not mine I\u2019m worried over,\u201d Ewan snarled.</p><p>\u201cWell, hell, Ewan, I can\u2019t see the lass, nor am I looking. \u2019Tis important or I wouldn\u2019t have breached your chamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEwan?\u201d</p><p>Mairin\u2019s sleepy voice rose from the covers, and her head poked out. Her hair was all rumpled, her eyes droopy, and yet somehow she still managed to look adorable. Even though Caelen claimed not to be looking, Ewan caught his brother glancing Mairin\u2019s way.</p><p>Ewan leaned over and brushed the hair from her face and then kissed her on the forehead. \u201cListen to me, sweeting. I want you to go back to sleep. You need your rest.\u201d</p><p>She murmured something he couldn\u2019t hear and snuggled back underneath the blankets. He touched her cheek one last time and then rolled out of bed to pull his clothing on.</p><p>He ordered Caelen into the hall until he was finished put on his boots and picked up his sword. With one final look in Mairin\u2019s direction, he strode into the hall where Caelen fell into step with him.</p><p>\u201cSweeting? You need your sleep?\u201d Caelen mimicked. \u201cI think you\u2019re missing your scrotum, brother.\u201d</p><p>Ewan balled his fist and slammed it into Caelen\u2019s jaw. Caelen went reeling and had to catch himself on the wall to keep from falling down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWell damn, Ewan. I have to say marriage doesn\u2019t agree with you,\u201d Caelen said, as he rubbed his jaw.</p><p>\u201cI think it agrees with me just fine.\u201d</p><p>As they entered the hall, Ewan saw Alaric stride in, his clothing dusty and lines of fatigue creasing his face.</p><p>\u201cYou dragged me from a warm bed for Alaric\u2019s arrival?\u201d Ewan asked.</p><p>\u201cHe said \u2019twas important. He sent a messenger ahead to summon you to meet him,\u201d Caelen defended.</p><p>\u201cEwan,\u201d Alaric called as he strode forward.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so urgent that you sent a messenger ahead of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMcDonald is on his way here.\u201d</p><p>Ewan frowned. \u201cHere? Why? What happened, Alaric?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou married. That\u2019s what happened. Laird McDonald had every intention of marrying off his daughter to you. He\u2019s not pleased to discover that\u2019s no longer an option. He\u2019s insisted on meeting with you, no matter that you are newly married, as I tried to explain. He informed me that if you wanted this alliance, you would meet with him.\u201d</p><p>Ewan cursed. \u201cWe\u2019re in no position to host anyone. We can barely feed our own clan and now we have to host McDonald and his men? We need weeks to prepare for an event such as this, not mere days.\u201d</p><p>Alaric grimaced and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ewan asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cNot days. Day.\u201d</p><p>More curses blistered Ewan\u2019s lips. \u201cDay? When is he arriving?\u201d</p><p>Alaric sighed and wiped his forehead wearily. \u201cWhy do you think I ran my horse into the ground to get here? McDonald will arrive on the morrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEwan?\u201d</p><p>Ewan whirled to see Mairin standing a short distance away, her gaze questioning.</p><p>\u201cMay I have permission to speak?\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow, surprised she\u2019d even ask. But he also saw how nervous she appeared as she stared at his two brothers.</p><p>He held out his ha, and she hurried over to take it. \u201cYou have need of something, Mairin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI overheard, I mean about Laird McDonald coming. Is there trouble?\u201d</p><p>Worry shadowed her blue eyes as she stared up at him.</p><p>\u201cNay, sweeting, no trouble. Laird McDonald and I are in talks. \u2019Tis nothing for you to worry over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be here tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>She frowned and then squared her shoulders. \u201cThere\u2019s much to be done, Ewan. Are you going to be difficult about my injury and make me stay abed, or are you going to allow me to do my duty so that I\u2019m not shamed beyond measure when we have important guests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShamed?\u201d</p><p>She huffed in exasperation. \u201cThe keep is in no condition for visitors. There\u2019s cleaning to do, food to cook, instructions to give. Why, if someone arrived today, they\u2019d think me the most incompetent of any laird\u2019s wife. Not only would I be shamed, but you would be shamed as well.\u201d</p><p>She sounded so appalled over the idea that she would bring shame to him that his gaze softened. He squeezed her hand, which he still held between his own.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you promise to ease off if you start feeling any pain, I have no issue with you working to ready the keep. However, I expect any of the harder tasks to be taken by the other women. I don\u2019t want you doing anything to tear your stitches.\u201d</p><p>Her smile lit up the entire room. Her eyes danced and she squeezed his fingers. She looked exuberant, like she wanted to fling her arms around him, but she collected herself and let go of his hand.</p><p>\u201cMy thanks, Laird. I won\u2019t let you down.\u201d</p><p>She bobbed a quick curtsy and hurried off. \u201cWelcome home, Alaric,\u201d she called back. Then she stopped and turned, a frown marring her lips. She hastened back over to Alaric and took his hand. \u201cYour pardon. I didn\u2019t even think to ask you if you\u2019d had refreshment after your journey. Are you well? We are glad to have you home.\u201d</p><p>Alaric looked befuddled as Mairin gripped his hand and shook it up and down as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to have hot water brought up to your chamber so you can take a bath?\u201d</p><p>Alaric looked appalled by the suggestion, and Ewan stifled his laughter.</p><p>\u201cUh, nay, the loch will suffice.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mairin frowned again. \u201cOh, but the loch is so cold. Wouldn\u2019t you prefer hot water?\u201d</p><p>Caelen snickered. \u201cGo ahead, Alaric. Have a nice long soak in the tubhe &gt;</p><p>Alaric sent Caelen a quelling stare. Then he smiled gently at Mairin, which was good, because Ewan didn\u2019t want to have to admonish his brother for hurting his wife\u2019s feelings.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis very good of you to think of me, but there\u2019s no need to have water brought up. I much prefer a swim in the loch over trying to stuff myself into a tub of water.\u201d</p> <p>Mairin smiled brilliantly up at him. \u201cVery well then. If I have your leave, Laird, I\u2019ll be on my way. There is much to be done this day.\u201d</p><p>Ewan motioned for her to go and she rushed away, her feet barely hitting the floor in her haste.</p><p>Alaric turned to Ewan with a frown. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this about resting and opening her stitches? What the hell did you do to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d Ewan said. \u201cLet\u2019s eat. I\u2019ll tell you all that has transpired since you left, and you can fill me in on what happened with McDonald.\u201d</p><p>Mairin swept through the keep with a purpose, noting what needed to be done and what could be done in twenty-four hours\u2019 time. Half an hour later, she summoned Maddie and Bertha and informed them that she\u2019d need their help if they had any prayer of pulling off a miracle.</p> <p>Maddie and Bertha assembled the women of the keep and Mairin addressed them from the top of the steps that led outside to the courtyard.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow we have important guests,\u201d she explained to the assembled crowd. \u201cAnd none of us wants to let our laird down.\u201d</p><p>There were murmurs of nay and the women shook their heads.</p><p>Mairin divided them into groups and divvied up chores. She even got the children involved. Soon the keep was alive with activity as women rushed to and fro.</p><p>Next, Mairin spoke to the men who were assigned to repairs that day. She instructed them to clean the stables and ready stalls for McDonald\u2019s horses.</p><p>Finally she went in search of Gertie to tackle the matter of food.</p> <p>The cook wasn\u2019t pleased to discover she had to prepare a veritable feast for unexpected guests. She blustered and protested, but Mairin stared her down and told her there was little to be gained by complaining. They couldn\u2019t very well starve their guests.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no miracle worker, my lady,\u201d Gertie grumbled. \u201cThere isn\u2019t enough food to feed our clan, much less a horde of McDonalds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are our options?\u201d Mairin asked tiredly. \u201cWhat do we have and how can we make it stretch?\u201d</p><p>Gertie motioned for Mairin to follow her into the larder. The shelves were frighteningly bare. They were nearly out of staples and the only meat was from the last hunt.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re existing hunt to hunt. If the men fail t bring back food, we go without. We have none stored up. If we don\u2019t replenish our stocks in the coming months, the winter is going to be a hard one indeed.\u201d</p><p>Mairin frowned unhappily. Hopefully her dowry would be delivered long before then and the clan wouldn\u2019t ever have to go hungry again. It hurt her to imagine the children going without.</p><p>She rubbed her forehead and temples as the ache intensified. \u201cWhat if we send the men out to hunt? If they bring back something this evening, would you have time to prepare for an evening meal on the morrow?\u201d</p><p>Gertie rubbed her chin and thoughtfully perused the storeroom. \u201cIf they could bring me back a mess of rabbits, I could make a stew and use the few bits of venison we have left over. \u2019Twould have a good flavor even if there wasn\u2019t a whole lot of meat. I can use what flour we have left to make bread, and I can have oatcakes for dipping as well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt sounds wonderful, Gertie. I\u2019ll go see the laird at once about sending a few of his men out hunting. With any luck, they\u2019ll bring home enough to make a huge pot that will last us through the McDonalds\u2019 visit.\u201d</p><p>Gertie nodded. \u201cYou do that, lass. I\u2019ll start on the bread in the meantime.\u201d</p><p>Mairin left and went in search of Ewan. She found him in the courtyard overseeing a group of younger men as they went through a series of exercises. Remembering what had happened last time, she waited patiently on the perimeter until Ewan saw her.</p><p>She gave a small wave and motioned him over. He spoke a few words to his men and then came over to where she was.</p><p>\u201cEwan, we have need of rabbits. As many as can be gotten. Is there any way you could spare some men for hunting?\u201d</p><p>Ewan glanced across the courtyard to where his brothers were engaged in a heated sparring session. Curses rang out from both Caelen and Alaric as they tried valiantly to best the other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go myself,\u201d Ewan said. \u201cI\u2019ll take Caelen and Alaric. We\u2019ll bring back the rabbits you need.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThank you. Gertie will be relieved. She was in a panic over how to feed the McDonalds.\u201d</p><p>Ewan\u2019s eyes went dark and his lip curled. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure the clan is provided for. I always have.\u201d</p><p>Mairin laid a hand on his arm. \u201cI know you will, Ewan. When my dowry arrives, we won\u2019t have to worry about what to eat anymore.\u201d</p><p>He touched her face, palming her cheek for a long moment before letting his fingers trail down to her jaw. \u201cYou\u2019re a miracle to this clan, lass. We\u2019ll be hale and hearty again thanks to you.\u201d</p><p>She flushed to the roots of her hair, warmed by the tenderness in his touch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be going now. Expect us back before sundown.\u201d</p><p>She watched as he strode across the courtyard and called for Alaric and Caelen. Then she turned and hurried back to the steps of the keep. There was still much to be done in preparation for the McDonalds. She\u2019d be lucky if she slept any this night.</p><p>CHAPTER 24</p><p>Mairin surveyed the hall with weary appreciation. It was nearly dawn and the women had worked through the night. Those with children, Mairin had sent home the night before, but a small group had stayed on with Mairin to see to the final preparations.</p><p>The result was astonishing. Not that Mairin would ever want to do such a thing again in less than a day, but she was well satisfied with the results.</p><p>The inside of the keep sparkled. The floors and walls had been washed. The candles in the ceiling fixtures had been replaced with new ones, and light danced shadows along the ceilings.</p><p>Sweet-smelling flowers ridded the musty odor of sweat and dirt, and Mairin had taken furs from the bed chambers to line the floor in front of the great stone fireplaces.</p><p>The smell of simmering stew had tortured Mairin for the last hours, as Gertie had prepared the rabbits that Ewan and his brothers brought back from the hunt. She was drooling over the idea of a hot piece of crusty bread straight from the oven.</p><p>Ewan had tried to get Mairin to take to their bed hours before, but she\u2019d been adamant that the tasks be done since they didn\u2019t know exactly when Laird McDonald would arrive.</p><p>\u201cIt looks wonderful, my lady,\u201d Maddie said proudly.</p><p>Mairin looked over to where Bertha and Maddie stood and she smiled. \u201cAye, it does. It looks nothing like before. Even with the repairs that must be done and the damage from the fire, no one can find fault with our work.\u201d</p><p>Bertha wiped a stray hair from her forehead. \u201cThe laird will be proud to welcome guests here. You\u2019ve performed a miracle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you both for giving up your night to help me,\u201d Mairin said. \u201cYou and Maddie tell the other women to take to their beds and not to worry about rising before noon. The other serving women can take over your duties while you rest.\u201d</p><p>Both women nodded gratefully and hurried off, leaving Mairin alone in the hall.</p><p>Mairin surveyed her handiwork one more time before she turned and trudged toward the stairs. She\u2019d not exactly kept her word to Ewan. Her side pained her considerably, and she hoped she hadn\u2019t torn any of the stitches, but the truth of the matter was, the work needed to be done, and it wasn\u2019t fair to expect the women of the keep to work long hours if she herself wasn\u2019t willing.</p><p>She felt great satisfaction in the role she\u2019d taken on. The women had worked long and hard but with a cheerful spirit. They had gone to great lengths to please Mairin, and een adaman turn pleased her.</p><p>For the first time, this felt like home. Her home. And she felt truly a part of the McCabe clan.</p><p>She eased into her chamber, but she needn\u2019t have bothered. Ewan was awake and dressed and was just finishing putting on his boots.</p><p>He frowned when he caught sight of her and immediately stood, his hand going out to steady her when she swayed.</p><p>\u201cYou put in far too many hours,\u201d he admonished. \u201cAre you in pain? Did you tear your stitches?\u201d</p><p>She leaned her forehead on his chest, content to remain there for a moment as she collected herself. He swept his hands up her arms to her shoulders and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going straight to bed, lass. I won\u2019t have any argument. And you aren\u2019t to rise until the McDonalds arrive. Are we understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d she mumbled. She wouldn\u2019t even have to pretend to obey that order.</p><p>\u201cCome, let me see your wound.\u201d</p><p>He guided her toward the bed and, with gentle hands, divested her of her clothing.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis a sin how expertly you rid a woman of her clothing,\u201d Mairin grumbled.</p><p>He smiled as he turned her to her side. He thumbed over the stitched area and frowned when she flinched.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis red and swollen. You\u2019re not taking proper care, Mairin. If you aren\u2019t careful, you\u2019re going to end up in bed with a fever.\u201d</p><p>She yawned broadly and fought to keep her eyes open. \u201cThere\u2019s too much to do to be abed with fever.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her forehead, leaving his lips there a moment. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel warm to the touch. Yet. Sleep. I\u2019ll have one of the women send up hot water for your bath when I receive word the McDonalds have reached our border.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice,\u201d she murmured sleepily, but she had already lost her hold on wakefulness and she surrendered to the darkness.</p><p>Mairin came awake to a knock at her chamber door. She blinked to brush the heavy veil of sleep aside, but it felt as though someone had poured sand in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLady McCabe, we have your water for your bath,\u201d came the call from the door. \u201cThe McDonalds will arrive within the hour.\u201d</p><p>That woke her up.</p><p>She shoved aside the bedcovers and hurried to answer the summons. The women carried in pails of water and soon Mairin was immersed in the comfort of hot water. As much as she would have loved to have soaked until the water chilled, she hurried through the washing of her hair.</p><p>Two of the maids remained to help dry and brush out her hair. Mairin was fidgety and agitated throughout the process. She was nervous. This was her first real test as the new lady of the keep.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want Ewan or the McDonalds to find her lacking.</p><p>She dressed in her wedding finery and descended the stairs an hour later. The hall was bustling with activity, and Ewan stood talking with his brothers near the high table.</p><p>When she entered, Ewan looked up and saw her. The approval in his eyes made her spirits soar. He gestured for her to come to him and she hurried over to stand next to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just in time to greet our guests with me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey arrive in a few minutes\u2019 time.\u201d</p><p>Ewan led her from the hall, his brothers following behind. When they reached the courtyard, the McDonald soldiers were filing over the bridge and through the courtyard arch.</p><p>She was of course biased, but the McCabes presented a much more impressive sight.</p><p>Ewan stood on the steps with Mairin by his side, as the man in front dismounted and gave Ewan a nod.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis good to see you again, Ewan. \u2019Tis been far too long. When last I was here, your father greeted me. I sorely regret his passing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs do we all,\u201d Ewan said. \u201cMay I present my lady wife, Mairin McCabe?\u201d</p><p>Ewan escorted her down and she curtsied in front of the other laird.</p><p>Laird McDonald took her hand and bowed, pressing a kiss to her knuckles. \u201c \u2019Tis a great pleasure to meet you, Lady McCabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe honor is mine, Laird,\u201d she said. \u201cI offer you and your men refreshment, if you would come into the hall. The meal is set and ready to serve at your leisure.\u201d</p><p>The laird smiled broadly and then gestured behind him. \u201cMay I present my daughter, Rionna McDonald?\u201d</p><p>The young woman was reluctant in both manner and expression as she edged forward. So this was the woman whom Laird McDonald wanted Ewan to marry. It was all Mairin could do to keep the frown from her face. The lass was quite beautiful. Indeed her hair shone in the sun like spun gold and her complexion wasn\u2019t marred by a single blemish. Her eyes were a peculiar amber color that caught the highlights in her hair and seemed similarly gold in the sunshine.</p><p>Mairin cast a quick glance at Ewan to judge his reaction. The last thing she wanted was for him to feel regret that he\u2019d missed an opportunity to wed this woman.</p><p>Ewan\u2019s eyes glimmered with amusement. He probably saw right into Mairin\u2019s head and plucked out her thoughts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mairin turned and smiled to the other woman. \u201cDo come in, Rionna. I\u2019m sure you must be fatigued from your travel. You can sit by me at the table and we can become acquainted.\u201d</p><p>Rionna offered a faltering smile of her own and allowed Mairin to take her arm to lead her inside.</p><p>The meal was a lively affair. Laird McDonald was a loud, boisterous man, and he ate with an enthusiasm that appalled Mairin. Why, if she had to feed this man on a regular basis, the McCabe hunters would be hunting night and day with no rest in between.</p><p>Gertie frowned her disapproval as she refilled the laird\u2019s trencher for the third time. Mairin caught her eye and shook her head. It wouldn\u2019t do to insult the laird.</p> <p>The talk centered around mundane topics. Hunting. Raiding. Concerns over protection of their borders. After a while, Mairin tuned out, struggling to suppress the yawn that threatened to overtake her.</p><p>She tried in vain to engage Rionna in conversation, but the lass focused on her food and kept her head down during the entire meal.</p><p>When finally the men were finished eating, Ewan caught Mairin\u2019s eye, and she rose to excuse herself from the table. The time had come for the men to discuss whatever they discussed in meetings like this, and they no doubt had no desire for women to be present.</p><p>She thought to invite Rionna outside to take a stroll about the keep and perhaps indulge in play with the children, but as soon as Mairin excused herself from the table, Rionna hastened away.</p><p>With a shrug, Mairin went in search of Crispen.</p> <p>When the women departed the hall, Laird McDonald nodded toward Ewan. \u201cYour wife does you proud. The meal was magnificent and the welcome was warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife is a credit to our clan,\u201d Ewan agreed.</p><p>\u201cI was dismayed to hear of your marriage,\u201d the laird continued. \u201cI had hopes of a match between you and Rionna. It would seal an alliance and bind our clans.\u201d</p><p>Ewan lifted his brow but didn\u2019t say anything. He eyed McDonald to see where he was going with the current conversation.</p><p>McDonald looked over at Alaric and Caelen before returning his gaze to Ewan.</p><p>\u201cI would speak plainly with you, Ewan.\u201d</p> <p>Ewan motioned for his men to leave the table. Alaric and Caelen remained behind along with Ewan, Laird McDonald, and a few of his men who stood to the side.</p><p>\u201cI want this alliance,\u201d McDonald said.</p><p>Ewan pressed his lips together in thought. \u201cTell me, Gregor, why do you seek this alliance? Goodwill is not something I associate with our relationship since my father\u2019s death. And yet, you were loyal to him and he to you.\u201d</p><p>McDonald sighed and leaned back in his seat, his hands covering his protruding middle. \u201c \u2019Tis necessary now. Duncan Cameron threatens my holding. We\u2019ve become embroiled in a few skirmishes over the last months. I think he\u2019s testing the might of my army, and I\u2019ll be honest, we\u2019ve not faired well in the battles m\" wid19;ve fought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Ewan muttered. \u201cYour lands adjoin Neamh \u00c1lainn. The bastard is planning for the day he thinks to take over Mairin\u2019s lands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, and I can\u2019t hold him off by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you proposing? \u2019Tis obvious I can\u2019t marry your daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d McDonald said, drawing out his words. Then he looked over at Alaric. \u201cBut he can.\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER 25</p><p>Alaric nearly choked on his ale. Caelen looked relieved that McDonald\u2019s remark hadn\u2019t been intended for him, but he glanced sideways at his brother with sympathy written all over his face.</p><p>Ewan shot Alaric a warning look and turned his attention back to McDonald.</p><p>\u201cWhy is it so important that we seal this alliance with marriage? Surely there are important enough factors at work that we would ally ourselves for the common good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRionna is my heir. My only heir. I have no sons to take over when I die. The man she marries must be willing to assume the duties of laird as well as be strong enough to protect the holding from threats like Duncan Cameron. If our clans are allied not only through agreement but marriage, your loyalty to your brother won\u2019t allow you to ever break with our agreement.\u201d</p><p>Ewan stiffened and glared at the older man, outraged by the insult. \u201cAre you saying my word isn\u2019t good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, I\u2019m saying I would feel more secure in the alliance if there were more at stake than mutual protection. I don\u2019t want my lands in the hands of a man like Duncan Cameron. He\u2019s a greedy, power-hungry bastard who\u2019d betray his own mother to further his cause.</p><p>\u201cThere are rumors, Ewan, more now than ever, that Duncan plots against the king. And I\u2019ve heard that he might throw in his lot with Malcolm to support another uprising against the throne.\u201d</p><p>Ewan drummed his fingers on the table and looked again at Alaric, who wore what could only be described as a pained look of resignation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to speak to my brothers. I won\u2019t make any decision that affects Alaric without hearing his thoughts on the matter.\u201d</p><p>McDonald nodded. \u201cOf course. I would expect no less. Separately, we are strong clans. But together we would be a force to be reckoned with. Think you the McLauren clan would join in our cause?\u201d</p><p>The McLauren clan, though small, did have well-trained soldiers. Together with the McCabes and the McDonalds, they would form a formidable alliance that would only be strengthened when the McCabes controlled Neamh \u00c1lainn.</p><p>\u201cAye, they will,\u201d Ewan replied. \u201cWith the three of us united, it might sway Douglas to our side. He controls the lands north and west of Neamh \u00c1lainn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we plant the idea of Duncan Cameron sniffing around Neamh \u00c1lainn, he\u2019ll come around fast enough,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cHe alone can\u2019t stand up to a force like Cameron, but with us, Cameron doesn\u2019t stand a chance against our might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuncan Cameron doesn\u2019t stand a chance against me,\u201d Ewan said softly.</p><p>McDonald\u2019s eyebrow lifted in surprise. \u201cThat\u2019s a heavy boast, Ewan. You don\u2019t have his numbers.\u201d</p><p>Ewan smiled. \u201cMy men are better trained. They\u2019re stronger. They\u2019re more disciplined. I don\u2019t look to this alliance to defeat Cameron. I\u2019ll defeat him with or without allies. I look to alliances to cement the future.\u201d</p><p>At McDonald\u2019s disbelieving look, Ewan leaned back in his seat. \u201cWould you care for a demonstration, Gregor? Perhaps you\u2019d like to view firsthand those you ally yourself with.\u201d</p><p>McDonald\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat sort of demonstration?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour best men against my best men.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile spread across the older man\u2019s face. \u201cI like a good contest, I do. You\u2019re on. What shall we wager?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFood,\u201d Ewan said. \u201cThree months\u2019 store of meat and spices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod\u2019s teeth, you drive a hard bargain. I can\u2019t afford to part with that kind of bounty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re concerned about losing, we can of course call off the contest.\u201d</p><p>Knowing an opponent\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel was all-important, and for Gregor McDonald, his weakness was a challenge. Suggesting he was afraid of losing a wager was like summoning hounds to a carcass.</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d McDonald pronounced. He rubbed his hands in glee and his eyes gleamed triumphantly.</p><p>Ewan rose from his seat. \u201cNo time like the present.\u201d</p><p>McDonald leaped from his chair and gestured for one of his commanders. Then he peered suspiciously back at Ewan.</p><p>\u201cYou and your brothers aren\u2019t allowed to participate. Only your men. Soldier against soldier.\u201d</p><p>Ewan smiled lazily. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you prefer. I would not have a man under my command if he weren\u2019t as worthy as I am with a sword.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall enjoy raiding your stores when my men prove their mettle,\u201d McDonald crowed.</p><p>Ewan kept his smile and motioned for McDonald to precede himify the hall.</p><p>When McDonald hurried out to his men, Alaric hung back. \u201cEwan, are you giving consideration to this marriage business?\u201d</p><p>Ewan eyed his younger brother. \u201cAre you telling me you\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>Alaric frowned. \u201cNay, it isn\u2019t at all what I\u2019m saying. But hell, Ewan, I\u2019ve no desire to be saddled with a bride.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis a good opportunity for you, Alaric. You would be laird of your own clan. You\u2019d have lands and sons to hand that legacy down to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d Alaric said quietly. \u201cThis is my clan. Not the McDonalds.\u201d</p><p>Ewan put his hand on Alaric\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll always be your clan. But think. My brother will be my closest neighbor. We\u2019ll be allies. If you stay here, you can never be laird. Your heir will never be laird. You should grab on to this with both hands.\u201d</p><p>Alaric sighed. \u201cBut marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a bonnie lass,\u201d Ewan pointed out.</p><p>\u201cPretty enough, I suppose,\u201d Alaric grunted. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see much of her face during the meal because she had it pointed down the entire time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be plenty of time to see her face. Besides, \u2019tis not the face you need to concern yourself with. \u2019Tis the rest.\u201d</p><p>Alaric laughed and then looked quickly around. \u201cBetter not let your bride hear you say that. You might be sleeping with your men tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready, Ewan?\u201d McDonald boomed across the courtyard.</p><p>Ewan held up his hand. \u201cAye, I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth are they doing?\u201d Mairin asked as she heard the roar from the courtyard.</p><p>Crispen grabbed her hand and tugged her toward the hill. \u201cLet\u2019s go up the hill so we can see!\u201d</p><p>The other children followed suit and soon they stood atop the hill. Mairin shielded her face from the sun so she could see the goings-on below.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fighting!\u201d Crispen exclaimed.</p><p>Mairin\u2019s eyes widened at the sight of so many warriors gathered in a tight circle. In the middle stood two soldiers, one a McCabe and one a McDonald.</p><p>\u201cWhy, that\u2019s Gannon,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy is Gannon fighting the McDonald soldier?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis the way of things,\u201d Crispen boasted. \u201cMen fight. Women tend the hearth.\u201d</p><p>Gretchen punched Crispen in the arm and gave him a fierce glare. Robbie in turn shoved Gretchen.</p><p>Mairin frowned and stared down at him. \u201cYour father told you that, no doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Caelen did.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. Why didn\u2019t that surprise her?</p><p>\u201cBut why are they fighting?\u201d she persisted.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis a wager, my lady!\u201d</p><p>Mairin turned to see Maddie heading up the hill, several of the McCabe women on her heels. They carried a basket between them.</p><p>\u201cWhat wager?\u201d she asked, as the women approached.</p><p>Maddie plunked the basket down and the rich smell of bread wafted through the air. Despite the splendid meal in which she had partaken, Mairin put a hand to her rumbling stomach.</p><p>The children leaned forward eagerly, their expressions hopeful as they circled Maddie.</p><p>\u201cOur laird and Laird McDonald have a wager as to whose men can best the other,\u201d Maddie said, as she began passing out bread to the women now sitting on the ground. Then she passed a hunk to each of the children. She motioned to Mairin. \u201cJoin us, my lady. We thought to have a picnic and cheer the McCabe warriors on.\u201d</p><p>Mairin settled onto the ground, spreading her skirts about her legs. Crispen plopped down next to her and began devouring his treat. Mairin took a piece of the bread and tore a piece off. As she placed the bit to her lips, she frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s the wager?\u201d</p><p>Maddie smiled. \u201cOur laird is cunning! He wagered three months\u2019 stock of food. If the McCabes win, we\u2019ll collect meat and spices from the McDonald stores.\u201d</p><p>Mairin\u2019s mouth gaped open. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have three months\u2019 stock of food!\u201d</p><p>Bertha nodded sagely. \u201cExactly. He wagered the thing we need the most. \u2019Twas brilliant and well thought out of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if we lose? We can\u2019t possibly afford to part with such riches. We don\u2019t even have it to lose.\u201d</p><p>One of the older women tsked under her breath. \u201cOur warriors won\u2019t lose. \u2019Tis disloyal to think they would.\u201d</p><p>Mairin scowled. \u201cI\u2019m not being disloyal. I just thought it was odd the laird would wager what we don\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince we won\u2019t lose, it really isn\u2019t an issue,\u201d Maddie said, patting Mairin\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cOh, look, Gannon\u2019s won his bout and now \u2019tis Cormac\u2019s turn!\u201d Christina exclaimed. \u201cHe\u2019s ever so handsome, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>The women around Christina smiled indulgently. Maddie leaned forward and whispered conspiratori&gt;The \u201cOur Christina has eyes for Cormac.\u201d</p><p>Mairin observed the way Christina\u2019s cheeks went pink as soon as Cormac strode into the circle. His shirt was off and the muscles bulged and rippled in his arms. He did make a fine sight. Not as fine a sight as Ewan, but still not bad at all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Christina gasped when Cormac took a particularly hard blow and fell back. She covered her mouth with her hand and stared as the warrior picked himself up and lunged forward again. The sounds of clanging metal pierced the air as Cormac fought with renewed vengeance.</p><p>It was over seconds later, when Cormac\u2019s opponent\u2019s sword went flying through the air. Cormac raised his sword over his head and then slashed downward until the point rested under the other man\u2019s chin.</p><p>The man held up his hands in surrender and Cormac extended a hand to help him to his feet.</p><p>\u201cOur men are making short work of the McDonald warriors,\u201d Bertha said smugly.</p> <p>Indeed the McCabe soldiers quickly dispatched the next two. The match was over, given that four of the McDonald warriors had already fallen, but the fifth stalked into the ring fully adorned with protective armor and helmet.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a small one!\u201d Maddie exclaimed. \u201cWhy, he can\u2019t be more than a lad.\u201d</p><p>Evidently, Diormid, who\u2019d been chosen to go last, agreed, because he stood to the side, a perplexed look on his face. When the smaller warrior raised his sword, Diormid shook his head and strode forward.</p><p>Though he was a great deal smaller than Diormid, he proved to be extremely nimble and agile. He deftly avoided blows that would likely have knocked him from his feet.</p><p>The McDonald warriors, inspired by the best performance thus far, surged forward, shouting encouragement to the lad. He was quick to parry and he had Diormid fighting to remain on his feet.</p> <p>Mairin found herself holding her breath, impressed by the smaller man\u2019s courage. She leaned forward as Diormid dodged a barrage of thrusts and she held her breath when the lad jumped to avoid Diormid\u2019s sweeping kick.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis so exciting,\u201d Gretchen whispered beside her.</p><p>Mairin smiled at the little girl who was so enraptured by the spectacle in front of them.</p><p>\u201cAye, it is. It looks like Diormid has his hands full with the lad.\u201d</p><p>The fight wore on and it was apparent that Diormid was frustrated by his inability to make the much smaller man yield. Diormid\u2019s movements became more desperate and wild. It was clear he wanted to end the fight and just as clear the lad was having none of it.</p><p>Then an amazing thing happened. Diormid lunged and the lad\u2019s leg shot out, tripping Diormid. In an instant, the lad leaped on top of Diormid with a yell worthy of the most seasoned warrior. Sword held high, he slashed downward until the point rested against the vulnerable flesh of Diormid\u2019s neck.</p> <p>Diormid glared up at the youth but finally dropped his sword in concession.</p><p>\u201cThe lad has bested our Diormid,\u201d Maddie whispered.</p><p>Slowly the lad rose and extended his hand down to Diormid. He pulled himself up, nearly knocking the lad off his feet as he struggled with the weight of the much larger warrior.</p><p>The McDonald man staggered back then sheathed his sword. Then he yanked his helmet from his head and a mass of golden hair spilled from the confines.</p><p>Rionna McDonald stood in front of the assembled men, her hair flashing in the sun. The women next to Mairin gasped in astonishment.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis a lass!\u201d Gretchen exclaimed in delight. She rounded on Robbie, her eyes gleaming with unholy light. \u201cSee? I told you that women could be warriors!\u201d</p><p>Crispen and Robbie were both staring at Rionna with a mixture of awe and grudging admiration.</p><p>Rionna\u2019s father was apoplectic. He shoved through the crowd of men, his face mottled in rage. He waved his arms and shouted at Rionna, and Mairin strained to hear his words.</p> <p>Rionna bowed her head, but not before Mairin saw the flash of anger cross her face. Rionna\u2019s free hand curled into a fist at her side and she took a step back from her ranting father.</p><p>Mairin was on her feet, her heart going out to the woman despite the fact that she\u2019d donned man\u2019s garb and humiliated a McCabe warrior. Indeed, Diormid was furious, his face as dark as a storm cloud.</p><p>Still, Mairin found herself hurrying toward the courtyard, intent on rescuing the lass from a horde of angry men. Murmuring pardons, she elbowed through the men, ignoring their irritated murmurs when she shoved them aside.</p><p>Getting through the last line was difficult because the warriors were all shoulder to shoulder. She poked and prodded without success and finally she kicked one in the back of the knee, causing it to buckle.</p><p>He turned with a snarl until he saw who was behind him. His expression turned to one of shock and he hastily stepped aside to let Mairin through.</p><p>Relieved that she\u2019d made it into the ring, she realized she didn\u2019t have a plan beyond getting there. Ewan didn\u2019t take her presence well and he stared holes in her from across the ring of warriors.</p><p>Mairin tucked Rionna\u2019s hand into hers, ignoring Rionna\u2019s look of surprise.</p><p>\u201cCurtsy,\u201d Mairin whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurtsy then back away with me. And smile. Really big smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBegging your pardons, Lairds. We\u2019ll be going now. The children of the keep need our attention, and we must see to the evening meal,\u201d Mairin said. She offered them a dazzling smil and dipped into a curtsy.</p><p>Rionna flashed a smile, and Mairin marveled at how stunning the lass was. Her mouth spread into a wide smile, showing perfectly straight, white teeth and a dimple in the smooth skin of her cheek. Rionna also dipped low in a curtsy and then allowed Mairin to drag her toward the perimeter.</p><p>The men tripped over themselves to move as Mairin gifted them with another sweet smile. She dragged Rionna off, fully expecting Ewan\u2019s roar at any moment. When she managed to exit the courtyard, she breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Rionna asked.</p><p>\u201cThere is a little girl who would dearly love to meet you,\u201d Mairin said cheerfully. \u201cShe was most impressed with your performance.\u201d</p><p>Rionna shot her a puzzled look but allowed Mairin to take her all the way up the hill where the others sat watching with avid interest.</p><p>Gretchen could contain herself no longer. As soon as Mairin and Rionna drew near, Gretchen jumped to her feet and fairly danced over to Rionna.</p><p>She curtsied but bubbled over with excitement and proceeded to bombard Rionna with a dozen questions in succession.</p><p>Seeing Rionna\u2019s complete befuddlement, Mairin took pity on her and laid a hand on Gretchen\u2019s shoulder to staunch the flood of chatter.</p><p>\u201cGretchen wants to be a warrior,\u201d Mairin explained. \u201cIt was explained to her that women couldn\u2019t be warriors, and now she\u2019s decided that \u2019tis obviously an untruth since you defeated Diormid in swordplay.\u201d</p><p>Rionna smiled, this time a genuine smile, and knelt in front of Gretchen. \u201cI must share a secret with you, Gretchen. \u2019Tis not a popular opinion, but I firmly believe that a woman can be whatever she wants to be if she sets her mind to it.\u201d</p><p>Gretchen was aglow with delight. Then she became somber as she looked beyond Rionna to the courtyard. \u201cYour papa wasn\u2019t happy that you fought Diormid.\u201d</p><p>Rionna\u2019s eyes darkened from the light gold to an amber hue. \u201cMy father despairs of ever making a lady of me. He\u2019s not impressed with my skills as a warrior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impressed,\u201d Gretchen said shyly.</p><p>Rionna smiled again and took Gretchen by the hand. \u201cWould you like to touch the hilt of my sword?\u201d</p><p>Gretchen\u2019s eyes rounded and her mouth dropped open. \u201cCould I?\u201d</p><p>Rionna guided her hand down until it hovered over the jewel-encrusted hilt of the sword. \u201c \u2019Tis smaller than a normal sword. \u2019Tis lighter, too. Makes it easier for me to wield it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s amazing,\u201d Gretchen breathed.</p><p>\u201cI want to see!\u201d Robbie said belligerently.</p><p>He and Crispen both shoved forward, their eyes bright with wonder.</p><p>\u201cCan we touch?\u201d Crispen whispered.</p><p>As reticent as Rionna had been over the meal, she was open and friendly with the children. Mairin decided she must just be extremely shy.</p><p>As the children gathered around Rionna, chattering and exclaiming over her sword, Mairin chanced a glance back at the courtyard to see Ewan standing in the distance, hands knotted at his waist as he stared at her.</p><p>She offered a small wave and turned away before he got any ideas about summoning her.</p><p>When the children drifted away from Rionna, Mairin eyed the other woman. \u201cWould you like to have a bath drawn before the evening meal?\u201d</p><p>Rionna shrugged. \u201cI usually swim in the loch, but I suppose it would horrify my father if I were to do so here.\u201d</p><p>Mairin\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cAre you mad? The water is frigid!\u201d</p><p>Rionna smiled. \u201c \u2019Tis good training for the mind.\u201d</p><p>Mairin shook her head. \u201cI have no understanding for someone who would forego the joys of a tub full of hot water for a hellish swim in an icy loch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince swimming in the loch isn\u2019t a possibility, I\u2019ll gladly take you up on your kind offer of a hot bath,\u201d Rionna said with a grin. Then she cocked her head to the side and looked at Mairin with an odd expression on her face. \u201cI like you, Lady McCabe. I don\u2019t appall you as I do others. And the way you waded through the men to rescue me was very well done.\u201d</p><p>Mairin flushed. \u201cOh, do call me Mairin. If we\u2019re to be friends, \u2019tis only appropriate that you should address me thusly.\u201d</p><p>Maddie cleared her throat behind Mairin, and Mairin turned, horrified that she\u2019d forgotten her manners.</p><p>\u201cRionna, I want you to meet the women of my clan.\u201d</p><p>Each woman stepped forward in turn and Mairin went down the line, introducing those whose names she remembered. Maddie supplied the names that Mairin hadn\u2019t learned as of yet.</p><p>When they were done, Maddie directed the women back to the keep so they could heat water for Rionna\u2019s bath.</p><p>After showing Rionna to the chamber she would occupy, Mairin went below stairs to check on the plans for the evening meal.</p><p>She was nearly to the kitchens when Ewan entered the hall. Laird McDonald accompanied him and Mairin quickened her step.</p><p>\u201cWhere is my daughter?\u201d Laird McDonald demanded.</p><p>Mairin paused and turned to face the surly laird. \u201cShe\u2019s above stairs seeing to her bath and dressing for the evening meal.\u201d</p><p>Apparently mollified by the idea that his daughter wasn\u2019t out battling more warriors, the laird nodded before turning back to Ewan. Mairin waited a moment, fully expecting Ewan to reprimand her for her interference, but he looked past Laird McDonald and winked.</p><p>It was done so fast that she was sure she\u2019d seen wrong. The idea of the laird doing something like winking was too much to contemplate. Sure she\u2019d imagined it, she headed for the kitchens once more.</p><p>CHAPTER 26</p><p>Mairin was long asleep when Ewan came to their chamber that night. He stood by the bed and watched as she slept, so burrowed under the furs that only her nose peeked out.</p><p>Talks with McDonald had rapidly deteriorated as more ale had been consumed. Instead of talking marriage and alliances, the men had sat around the table in the hall drinking and engaging in bawdy tellings of tavern wenches and old battle scars.</p><p>Ewan had excused himself, more interested in slipping into a warm bed with his wife than engaging in ribald boasting. It should bother him that even asleep the lass had such a hold over him that all he had to do was imagine her above stairs in his bed and he grew restless and ready to depart the men. But he found that it didn\u2019t bother him at all.</p><p>While the rest were in the hall fondly recounting nights spent in the arms of a woman, he\u2019d be above stairs holding his in his arms.</p><p>He undressed and carefully pulled back the bed covers. She immediately stirred, frowned, and then yanked the furs to bring them back up. He chuckled and slid into bed beside her.</p><p>The shock of her warm body against his brought him instantly and fully to awareness. She stirred again, murmured something in her sleep, and proceeded to burrow underneath him.</p><p>Her nightdress fell down one arm, baring the curve of her neck and the smooth skin of her shoulder. Unable to resist, he pressed his mouth to her flesh and nibbled a path to the column of her neck.</p><p>He loved her taste, loved the way her scent filled his nose as his tongue laved over her softness. She emitted a sigh that tickled over his ear.</p><p>\u201cEwan?\u201d she asked sleepily.</p><p>\u201cWho else were you expecting, lass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. It seems every time I wake, there are people in our chamber.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and nipped at her earlobe.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t angry with me?\u201d</p><p>He drew back and stared down at her. \u201cWhat have you done now?\u201d</p><p>She huffed, and her lips twisted into a disgruntled line. \u201cI\u2019ve done nothing. I was referring to earlier today. When I took Rionna off me. I know I shouldn\u2019t have interfered but\u2014\u201d</p><p>He put a finger over her lips. \u201cNay, you shouldn\u2019t have. But I\u2019m fast discovering that you do many things you shouldn\u2019t. It was a good thing that you removed Rionna when you did. Her father was angry, and you diffused the situation. My only complaint is that you placed yourself in a potentially explosive situation, not to mention you waded through a bunch of men who were caught up in the excitement of a battle.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She slid her hands down his middle, lower, until she found his hardness. Her fingers circled his shaft and he groaned as he swelled within her grip.</p><p>\u201cBut you aren\u2019t angry,\u201d she said in a whisper-soft voice.</p><p>His eyes narrowed even as he pushed farther into her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t think I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re about, lass.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened innocently as she stroked him from his cods to the very tip of his cock. He leaned down to kiss her, breathing in her very essence. He inhaled, holding and savoring the air that had been hers and then he returned it and it danced around their lips and tongues.</p> <p>\u201cThis won\u2019t get you out of trouble every time,\u201d he warned.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll settle for most of the time.\u201d</p><p>He was about to lose himself in her hand. Her soft exploration was driving him to the brink of insanity. He had to have her. Now.</p><p>He reached down and clutched the hem of her night dress.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tear\u2014\u201d</p> <p>The sound of material ripping muffled her warning. He shoved the material up over her hips and rolled until he was positioned between her splayed thighs.</p><p>He found her heat, felt her silky warmth spread over the head of his shaft and with one push he was inside her. She gasped and arched into him, her belly trembling beneath his.</p><p>She was so tight around him, a fist gripping and squeezing, holding him so intimately that he began to unravel.</p><p>\u201cAh, lass, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>Her hands trailed over his shoulders, her nails scraping at his flesh. He closed his eyes, knowing this wouldn\u2019t last long at all.</p> <p>\u201cI seem to lose all control when I\u2019m with you. This will be fast. I cannot hold back.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis all right,\u201d she whispered. \u201cFor I find I cannot hold back either.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hips and wrapped her legs around his waist. It was too much for him to bear.</p><p>He thrust hard and already he felt himself letting go. Again he thrust, plunging mindlessly into her willing body. His seed purted forth and he kept driving, over and over, until her passage, so slick with his passion, released him.</p><p>Unwilling to deprive himself of her sweetness just yet, he tucked his shaft back to her opening and eased inward, riding the aftershocks as she trembled and spasmed around him.</p><p>He leaned forward, resting his weight on her while he remained inside her warm sheath. She was breathing hard, her puffs of air blowing over his neck and chest. Her body was tangled around his, arms and legs clutching him and holding him close as if she\u2019d never let go.</p><p>He liked that. Aye, he liked it a lot.</p><p>Finally he rolled to the side but kept her limbs entwined with his. He wanted her a part of him. He liked the sight of her much smaller body secured by his. She was his.</p> <p>She gave a lusty yawn and nuzzled into his chest. He knew she was asleep in a matter of moments, but he remained awake, liking the feel of so much feminine sweetness in his arms.</p><p>When he finally slept, he was careful to keep her as closely linked to him as possible.</p><p>The next day, Mairin busied herself with the women to prepare the noon meal while Ewan was occupied with Laird McDonald. The two men had gone hunting that morning, and much to Rionna\u2019s displeasure, she\u2019d been left out of the hunting party.</p><p>She sat in the hall dressed in man\u2019s garb, a loose-fitting tunic swallowing the upper half of her body, looking bored and faintly terrified by all the bustling going on around her.</p><p>Rionna was a bit of a mystery to Mairin. She wanted to ask the lass about her apparent fascination with the duties of a man, but she was afraid of insulting the woman. Mairin had heard from Maddie that Laird McDonald sought to marry his daughter to Alaric to seal the alliance with the McCabe clan, and that in fact, the lairds were in talks of just such an arrangement.</p><p>Mairin pitied Rionna because she gained the distinct impression that Rionna had no desire to marry, and Mairin could only imagine Alaric\u2019s reaction to the proposed arrangement.</p><p>What did the lass hope to accomplish by engaging in such shocking activities that obviously brought her father\u2019s ire down on her?</p><p>And Alaric, surely he wouldn\u2019t be accepting of his wife\u2019s wish to engage in swordplay. Ewan would be appalled, and Alaric was no different in his thinking. All the McCabe brothers had firm ideas of a woman\u2019s role, and it was definitely not the path that Rionna had chosen.</p><p>Rionna needed someone more ... understanding, though Mairin couldn\u2019t imagine any warrior allowing his wife the freedoms that Rionna apparently enjoyed.</p><p>Mairin shook her head and allowed Rionna to remain sprawled in one of the chairs to watch the goings-on around her.</p><p>\u201cIs everything prepared?\u201d Mairin asked Gertie as she entered the sweltering heat of the small cooking area.</p><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019ve just taken the bread from down on hefire and the stew is simmering. As soon as the men return, I\u2019ll begin putting out the food.\u201d</p><p>Mairin thanked Gertie and then retraced her steps into the hall. A noise at the entrance told her that her husband had returned and she went to greet him.</p><p>She stood back, waiting for him to enter fully. He came in, Laird McDonald just behind him, with Caelen and Alaric bringing up the rear.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home, husband. If you and the laird would take your seats at the table, the meal will be served.\u201d</p><p>Ewan nodded his acknowledgment and she retreated to tell Gertie to begin the serving.</p><p>More of Ewan\u2019s men filtered in, mixing with Laird McDonald\u2019s soldiers. The three tables in the hall quickly filled up while the men who hadn\u2019t gained seats waited at the entrance to the kitchen for their portion.</p><p>Unsure of any marriage arrangement since Ewan hadn\u2019t seen fit to share Laird McDonald\u2019s proposal with Mairin, she opted to seat Rionna beside her, with Laird McDonald across the table on Ewan\u2019s other side. Alaric and Caelen would occupy the two seats next to Laird McDonald.</p><p>The meal was a loud, boisterous event as the morning\u2019s hunt was recounted for all to hear. Food and serving dishes went everywhere and Mairin found herself confused at one point as to which goblet was hers. She reached for the goblet between Ewan and herself and took a sip to chase down her food.</p><p>She wrinkled her nose at the bitter taste and hoped that the entire batch of ale hadn\u2019t gone bad. She set it aside so Ewan wouldn\u2019t drink it and motioned for Gertie to bring the laird another cup in case it was indeed his.</p><p>Laird McDonald kept Ewan engaged in talks of border protection, increased patrols, and the plan to strengthen their alliances by talking with Douglas.</p><p>Mairin paid only partial attention to the chatter as she watched Rionna pick idly at her portion. She was wondering what topic she could engage the other woman in when a cramp rippled across her belly.</p><p>She frowned and put a hand to her abdomen. Had the food been bad? But surely it was too soon to feel the effects, and the meat was fresh, brought in just two days ago. She watched the others but saw no sign of discomfort. In fact, everyone dug into their food with seeming satisfaction for the taste.</p><p>She reached for the goblet that had replaced the bitter ale when another cramp viciously seized her stomach. She gasped for breath but the pain was so intense that she doubled over.</p><p>Another pain knifed through her, gripping her middle in an unrelenting knot. Her vision blurred and she felt a sudden urge to vomit.</p><p>She shot to her feet and in her haste, knocked over Ewan\u2019s goblet. The liquid spilled over the table and into Ewan\u2019s lap.</p><p>Ewan jerked his head from his conversation with McDonald, a frown marring his lips. She swayed and then doubled over, a cry escaping as fire twisted her innards.</p><p>Rionna jumped up and bent anxiously over Mairin, her face creased with concern. Around her, murmurs arose as everyone focused on their mistress and her obvious distress.</p><p>\u201cMairin!\u201d</p><p>Ewan was on his feet, his hands reaching to steady her. She would have fallen had he not hauled her up against him. She went limp, her legs no longer able to sustain her weight.</p><p>\u201cMairin, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ewan demanded.</p><p>\u201cSick,\u201d she gasped. \u201cOh God, Ewan, I think I\u2019m dying. The pain.\u201d</p><p>She sagged again and Ewan went down with her, easing her weight to the floor. Above her, Alaric\u2019s worried face appeared.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on, Ewan?\u201d Alaric demanded. He shoved Rionna back and maintained a protective perimeter around Mairin.</p><p>And then she turned her head and retched all over the floor. The sound was awful even to her own ears, but it felt ten times worse.</p><p>It was as if she\u2019d swallowed a million pieces of glass and they were shredding her insides.</p><p>She curled into a ball on the floor in so much pain that in a moment of weakness, she prayed for death.</p><p>\u201cNay!\u201d Ewan roared. \u201cYou won\u2019t die. I won\u2019t allow it. Do you hear me, Mairin? I won\u2019t allow it. You will obey me, goddamn it! For once you will obey!\u201d</p><p>She whimpered as Ewan hauled her from the floor. She winced as his shouts rung in her ears. He yelled orders and the hall was alive with the sound of scrambling feet and answering exclamations.</p><p>She was jostled about in Ewan\u2019s arms as he charged up the stairs. He burst into their chamber, all the while shouting demands to the rest of his clan.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t gentle as he laid her on the bed. Her stomach heaved again as the smell of her own vomit seared her nostrils. Her dress. It was ruined. Now she couldn\u2019t even be buried in it.</p><p>Ewan clasped her face in his hands and leaned down until their noses were nearly touching.</p><p>\u201cNo one is burying you, lass. Do you hear? You will live or, so help me, I\u2019ll follow you to hell and drag you back kicking and screaming the entire way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hurt,\u201d she whimpered.</p><p>His touch gentled as he smoothed the hair from her face. \u201cI know, lass. I know you hurt. I\u2019d bear it for you if I could. Promise me you\u2019ll fight. Promise me!\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what she was supposed to fight, and the pain screaming through her insides made her want to curl into a ball and close her eyes, but when she tried, Ewan shook her until her teeth rattled in her head.</p><p>\u201cEwan, what\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d she whispered, as another wave of pain overwhelmd her.</p><p>His face was grim and going more blurry by the minute. \u201cYou\u2019ve been poisoned.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 27</p><p>It had been many years since Ewan had prayed. Not since the birth of his son, when he\u2019d prayed over his wife\u2019s bedside as she struggled to bring forth the life within her.</p><p>But he found himself offering fervent prayer now as he stood over Mairin\u2019s bedside. Maddie flew in behind him with Bertha on her heels.</p><p>\u201cYou must make her vomit, Laird,\u201d Bertha said. \u201cThere\u2019s no time to waste. We don\u2019t know how much of the poison she took in and she must rid her stomach of all its contents.\u201d</p><p>Ewan bent and grasped Mairin by the shoulders, rolling her to the edge of the bed so her head hung over the side. He took her face gently between his hands and pried her mouth with his thumb.</p><p>She twisted and fought against him but he tightened his grip, refusing to give way.</p><p>\u201cListen to me, Mairin,\u201d he said urgently. \u201cWe must rid your stomach of its contents. I must make you vomit. I\u2019m sorry, but I have no choice.\u201d</p><p>As soon as her lips parted, he thrust his fingers to the back of her throat and she gagged and convulsed. With only one arm to hold her, it was difficult.</p><p>\u201cHelp me hold her,\u201d he barked to Maddie. \u201cIf you can\u2019t do it, call one of my brothers.\u201d</p><p>Bertha and Maddie both leaped forward, pressing their full weight against Mairin\u2019s body.</p><p>Mairin gagged again and she vomited onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cAgain, Laird,\u201d Bertha urged. \u201cI know \u2019tis difficult to see her in such pain, but if she\u2019s to survive, it must be done.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d do anything to keep her from dying, even if it meant causing her agony. He held her head and forced her to retch. Again and again she heaved until nothing more would push itself out. Her entire body was so rigid, it was a wonder she hadn\u2019t broken any bones yet.</p><p>Still he pressed on, determined to keep her alive. Finally Bertha touched his arm. \u201c \u2019Tis done. You can release her now.\u201d</p><p>Maddie got up and wet a rag with water from the washbasin and thrust it at Ewan. He wiped Mairin\u2019s mouth and then her flushed, sweaty forehead.</p><p>Carefully he eased her back onto the bed and then stripped the clothing from her body. He tossed the garments aside and instructed the women to clean the chamber to rid it of the noxious smell.</p><p>He sat by Mairin\u2019s side as he pulled the covers to shield her nakedness. He watched anxiously, feeling so helpless that it kindled a rage so deep that he burned with it.</p><p>He could hear the commotion outside his chamber door, knew his brothers were there, and others, but he wouldn\u2019t take his eyes from Mairin.</p><p>The women rapidly cleaned the mess from the chamber and removed the offending clothing. Moments later, Maddie returned, shutting the door firmly behind her.</p><p>\u201cLaird, let me take over her care,\u201d she said in a soft voice. \u201cShe\u2019s emptied her stomach. There\u2019s naught to do but wait now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ewan shook his head. \u201cI won\u2019t leave her.\u201d</p><p>He ran a finger through her limp hair and touched her cheek, alarmed by how cool her skin felt to his touch. Her breathing was shallow, so light that many times he\u2019d leaned his head down, afraid that no air escaped her nose any longer.</p><p>She\u2019d slipped into unconsciousness. She hadn\u2019t moved, hadn\u2019t stirred or cried out from the vicious pain assaulting her. He didn\u2019t know what was worse. Hearing her helpless cries or seeing her as still as death.</p><p>They both frightened the hell out of him.</p> <p>Maddie stood by the bed for a long moment, and then with a sigh, she turned and left the chamber.</p><p>Before Ewan could recline on the bed beside Mairin, his brothers burst into the chamber.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Alaric demanded.</p><p>Caelen didn\u2019t speak, but the storm was there in his eyes as he stared down at Mairin.</p><p>Ewan touched Mairin\u2019s cheek again and ran his fingers underneath her nose until he felt the light exchange of air on his skin. There was so much turmoil churning in his gut. Rage. Fear. Helplessness.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he finally said. The admission twisted the knife in his belly until he had the same urge to vomit as Mairin.</p><p>\u201cWho did this?\u201d Caelen hissed. \u201cWho could have poisoned her?\u201d</p><p>Ewan glanced down at Mairin as anger knotted his chest. His nostrils flared and he curled his fingers into tight fists. \u201cMcDonald,\u201d he said through clenched teeth. \u201cGoddamn McDonald.\u201d</p><p>Alaric reared back in surprise. \u201cMcDonald?\u201d</p><p>Ewan stared hard at his two brothers. \u201cI want you to stay with her. The both of you. Summon me if there is any change in her condition. Right now I trust no one but you until I discover who is trying to kill my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEwan, where are you going?\u201d Caelen demanded, as Ewan stalked from the room.</p> <p>Ewan turned around as he reached the doorway. \u201cTo have a word with McDonald.\u201d</p><p>He stormed down the stairs, his sword drawn as he entered the hall where the majority of his soldiers were now assembled. They came to attention when they saw Ewan\u2019s sword at the ready.</p><p>McDonald stood to the side, surrounded by his guards. Rionna was next to him and the two were conversing in urgent tones. Tension knotted the air in the hall, so thick that Ewan\u2019s skin prickled with it.</p><p>Rionna looked up in alarm when she saw Ewan approach. She drew her sword and stepped in front of her father, but Ewan shoved her aside and she went reeling.</p><p>The hall erupted in chaos.</p><p>The McDonald men lunged for Ewan, and Ewan\u2019s men reacted fiercely in protection of their laird.</p><p>\u201cProtect the woman,\u201d Ewan barked to Gannon.</p><p>Ewan was on McDonald before he could draw his sword. Ewan grabbed the older man by the tunic and slammed him against the wall.</p> <p>McDonald\u2019s face purpled with rage and his cheeks puffed out as Ewan drew the collar of his tunic tighter around his neck. \u201cEwan, what is the meaning of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust how badly did you want me to marry your daughter?\u201d Ewan asked in a dangerously low voice.</p><p>McDonald blinked in confusion before realization set in. Spittle peppered his lips as he huffed and made sounds of outrage. \u201cAre you accusing me of poisoning Lady McCabe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>McDonald\u2019s eyes narrowed in fury. He shoved at Ewan\u2019s hands in an attempt to dislodge Ewan\u2019s hold, but Ewan only slammed him into the wall again.</p><p>\u201cThis is war,\u201d McDonald spat. \u201cI won\u2019t let this insult go unanswered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want war, I\u2019ll be more than happy to accommodate you,\u201d Ewan hissed. \u201cAnd when I\u2019ve wiped the earth with your blood, your lands and all you hold dear will be mine. You want to speak of insults, Laird? You come into my home, partake of my hospitality, and you try to kill my lady wife?\u201d</p><p>McDonald paled and stared hard into Ewan\u2019s eyes. \u201cI did not do this thing, Ewan. You have to believe me. Aye, I wanted Rionna to marry you, but a marriage with your brother will do just as well. I did not poison her.\u201d</p><p>Ewan\u2019s jaw twitched and his nostrils flared. Sweat broke out on McDonald\u2019s forehead and he looked nervously left and right, but his men had easily been staved off by Ewan\u2019s soldiers.</p><p>Rionna stood several feet away, her arms held by Gannon. She was spitting mad, and it took Gannon\u2019s all to restrain her.</p><p>There was no guilt in McDonald\u2019s eyes. Did he tell the truth? The timing of McDonald\u2019s arrival and Mairin\u2019s poisoning was too coincidental. Or was it only made to appear that way?</p><p>Ewan relaxed his hold and eased McDonald away from the wall. \u201cYou\u2019ll excuse my rudeness but I want you and your men off my lands at once. My wife lies deathly ill and I know not if she\u2019ll survive. Know this, McDonald. If she dies and if I discover you did this thing, there is no rock in all of Scotland that you can hide under, no corner you can seek refuge in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW\u2014What of our alliance?\u201d McDonald babbled.</p><p>\u201cAll that concerns me right now is my wife. Go home, McDonald. Go home and pray that she lives. We\u2019ll speak of our proposed alliance another day.\u201d</p><p>He all but threw McDonald toward the door leading from the hall.</p><p>\u201cEwan! The lass is sick again. She\u2019s retching something fierce. Nothing Caelen and I do seems to help.\u201d</p><p>Ewan whipped around to see Alaric standing at the entrance to the hall, his expression haggard.</p><p>\u201cSee to their departure,\u201d Ewan snapped at Gannon. \u201cEscort them to our border and make sure they don\u2019t linger.\u201d</p><p>Then Ewan broke into a run, shoving past Alaric as he thundered up the stairs.</p><p>He burst into the chamber to see Caelen holding Mairin over the side of the bed as she gagged and heaved. Caelen looked desperate, and yet he held Mairin protectively against him, anchoring her as her entire body shook with the force of her retching.</p><p>Caelen looked up as Ewan charged toward the bed. \u201cEwan, thank God you\u2019re here. I can\u2019t make her stop and \u2019tis killing her!\u201d</p><p>Ewan took Mairin\u2019s limp body and cradled her in his arms. \u201cShh, sweeting. Breathe with me. Through your nose. You must stop the retching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSick,\u201d she whimpered. \u201cPlease, Ewan, let me die. It hurts so much.\u201d</p><p>His heart turned over and he hugged her tighter against him. \u201cJust breathe,\u201d he whispered. \u201cBreathe for me, Mairin. The hurt will go away. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>She clutched his tunic so tight that the material drew uncomfortably across his arms. Her body tensed, but this time she managed to hold back the urge to vomit.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, lass. Hold on to me. I won\u2019t let you go. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>She buried her face against his neck and went limp. He lowered her to the bed then looked up at Caelen who stood by the bed, his face drawn in helpless fury.</p><p>\u201cWet a cloth so I can wipe her face.\u201d</p><p>Caelen hastened to the washbasin. He wrung out the cloth and shoved it in Ewan\u2019s direction. Ewan wiped Mairin\u2019s brow and then ran the damp material over her mouth. She sighed but didn\u2019t open her eyes as he cleaned the rest of her face.</p><p>She seemed to be over the spasms that wracked her stomach. She cuddled into his side and wrapped one arm around his middle. And then with a sigh, she slipped bak into a deep sleep.</p><p>Ewan cupped the back of her head and pressed his lips to her forehead. The fact that she\u2019d awakened was a good sign, but he hated to see her in such pain. Her body was trying to rid itself of the poison, and she was valiantly fighting the effects.</p><p>\u201cLive,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI won\u2019t let you die.\u201d</p><p>Alaric, who\u2019d followed Ewan back to the chamber, and Caelen looked discomfited by their brother\u2019s uncharacteristic display of emotion. In that moment, Ewan didn\u2019t care who saw him at his weakest.</p><p>\u201cYou care for her,\u201d Alaric said gruffly.</p><p>Ewan felt something inside him loosen and unfold. Aye, he loved her, and he couldn\u2019t bear the thought of losing her. By God, she was going to wake up, sass him, and then he\u2019d seduce her into giving him the words he most wanted to hear.</p><p>Aye, she\u2019d live, and then the difficult little lass was going to love him every bit as much as he loved her.</p><p>He looked to his brothers, who watched him with odd fascination. \u201cI have need of your help. Someone tried to kill her. As much as it pains me, it has to be someone from our clan. We have a traitor in our midst and he must be flushed out or Mairin will never be safe. I can\u2019t lose her. Our clan can\u2019t lose her. She represents our salvation\u2014and mine. If you won\u2019t do it for her, your sister, then do it for me, your brother.\u201d</p><p>Alaric went down to his knees by the bed and reached out and placed his fingers into Mairin\u2019s limp hand. Caelen squared his shoulders and then he, too, got on his knees at Alaric\u2019s side. He touched Mairin\u2019s shoulder and his gaze softened as he stared down at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always had our allegiance, Ewan,\u201d Alaric said in a grave voice. \u201cOur loyalty belongs to you. Now I pledge my allegiance and my loyalty to Mairin as well. I\u2019ll protect her as your wife and my sister. I\u2019ll place her safety above my own.\u201d</p><p>Alaric\u2019s solemn declaration sent a fierce surge of pride through Ewan.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good lass,\u201d Caelen said gruffly. \u201cShe\u2019s a good mother to Crispen and a loyal wife. She\u2019s a credit to you, Ewan. I would protect her with my life and seek justice for the wrongs committed against her. She\u2019ll always have a place of honor in my eyes.\u201d</p><p>Ewan smiled, knowing how difficult it must have been for Caelen to recite such a pledge. \u201cThank you. This means much to me. We must make sure she is safe from this day forward. She won\u2019t be easy to contain when she is back on her feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound sure of her recovery,\u201d Caelen said.</p><p>Ewan looked down again as hope burned in his gut like brimstone.</p><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019m sure. The lass is too contrary to give in to death.\u201d</p><p>Ewan met with his brothers late into the night. They sat in the hall with only a single candle to illuminate the dark room.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve questioned everyone who served, everyone in the kitchen, everyone who came into contact with the food, and everyone who was gathered in the hall,\u201d Caelen reported.</p><p>\u201cGertie is distraught,\u201d Alaric said grimly. \u201cShe\u2019s sick that Mairin was poisoned. I don\u2019t believe for a moment that Gertie was behind it even if she would have had the easiest opportunity of anyone. She\u2019s been with our clan since before we were born. She was loyal to our father and has been steadfast since his death.\u201d</p><p>Ewan didn\u2019t believe it either, but he\u2019d be a fool to discount the possibility. He couldn\u2019t imagine anyone in his clan trying to kill Mairin. Why would they? She represented hope. She was their salvation and there wasn\u2019t anyone who didn\u2019t know that.</p><p>But someone had.</p><p>Gannon and Cormac entered the hall, their expressions grim. Fatigue lined their faces and they made a direct line toward Ewan.</p><p>\u201cLaird, we have a report.\u201d</p><p>Ewan gestured for them to sit.</p><p>Cormac took a seat but Gannon opted to stand, his agitation evident in the way he clenched and unclenched his fists.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve determined the source of the poison,\u201d Gannon said.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Ewan bit out.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t in the food. We tested pieces from all the remaining plates, including Lady McCabe\u2019s. The poison was in a goblet. It was nearly full, so she didn\u2019t drink much of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Ewan breathed. There was hope yet.</p><p>\u201cLaird,\u201d Cormac said painfully. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe the goblet was Lady McCabe\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Ewan thumped his fists on the table and leaned forward. \u201cWhose was it then?\u201d</p><p>Gannon blew out his breath. \u201cWe believe it was yours, Laird.\u201d</p><p>At that, Caelen and Alaric nearly unsettled their chairs. \u201cWhat the hell do you mean?\u201d Caelen demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe spoke extensively with all the serving women. There were three goblets. One that Lady McCabe upended when she rose from the table. That was her goblet, but it wasn\u2019t placed correctly and we don\u2019t think she ever drank from it. She took your goblet and drank a small portion. It must have tasted badly to her because she pushed it to the side and summoned one of the serving women to bring you another goblet. Soon after, she grew ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why ...?\u201d Ewan\u2019s voice trailed off, and he looked up at his most trusted men and his brothers. \u201cThe arrow. The arrow wasn\u2019t intended for Mairin at all. It was meant for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesu,\u201d Alaric said in agitation. \u201cSomeone is trying to kill you, Ewan. Not Mairin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes more sense,\u201d Caelen said grimly. \u201cNo one gains if Mairin dies. That\u2019s not the case if Ewan dies and leaves Mairin without a husband and without child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron is behind this and somehow, someway he\u2019s infiltrated our clan. Someone here is doing his bidding. Twice he\u2019s tried to kill me and twice Mairin has nearly died as a result.\u201d Ewan\u2019s fist met the table with a sickening crack as he snarled out the realization. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAye, but who?\u201d Alaric asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we must find out,\u201d Ewan said. \u201cAnd until we do, Mairin must be watched closely at all times. I won\u2019t have her injured by another attempt on my life.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 28</p><p>Harsh shouting interrupted Mairin\u2019s nice, hazy dream. She couldn\u2019t be sure it was a dream, but it was all nice and floaty and she wasn\u2019t feeling any pain. She much preferred the nice, quiet float over the alternative.</p> <p>Then she found herself being shaken until her brain seemed to rattle inside her head. The pain was back and she heard Ewan\u2019s voice.</p><p>Oh, but the man did love to roar. He seemed to enjoy a good lecture, particularly when it was aimed at her.</p><p>\u201cYou are the most disobedient lass I\u2019ve ever had the misfortune to meet,\u201d Ewan snarled. \u201cI order you not to die and you\u2019re determined that you\u2019ll do just that. You\u2019re not the lioness who championed my son. She would never give up as you\u2019re giving up.\u201d</p><p>Mairin frowned at his insult. It was just like him to act so shamefully when she was sick and dying. He acted as though she\u2019d done it apurpose.</p><p>She heard him chuckle.</p> <p>\u201cNay, lass, you might well be sick, but you\u2019re not dying. You\u2019re going to obey me this time or, as God as my witness, I\u2019m going to turn you over my knee.\u201d</p><p>She glared, or at least she thought she did. The room still seemed incredibly dark to her, and her eyelids felt like someone had laid stones over them. Sudden panic hit her. Maybe they were preparing her for burial. Didn\u2019t they put stones over the eyes of the dead to keep them closed? Or was that coins? Either way, she didn\u2019t want to die.</p><p>\u201cShh, lass,\u201d Ewan soothed. \u201cOpen your eyes. You can do it for me. No one is burying you, I swear it. Open your eyes and look at me. Let me see those beautiful blue eyes.\u201d</p><p>It took all her might but she managed to crack her eyelids. She winced as sunlight speared through her head, and she promptly snapped her eyes shut again height=\"0em\"&gt;</p><p>\u201cCover the window,\u201d Ewan barked.</p><p>Mairin frowned. Who was he talking to? It was getting to be a regular occurrence for them to have visitors to their chamber.</p> <p>She heard a chuckle and she opened her eyes only to see a fuzzy shape that resembled Ewan. She blinked rapidly and then looked beyond him to see Alaric and Caelen in front of the now covered window.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis good you returned home when you did, Alaric. Ewan would need you for the funeral.\u201d</p><p>Alaric frowned. \u201cWhose funeral, lass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d she said.</p><p>She tried to lift her head but soon discovered that she was as weak as a newborn kitten.</p><p>Caelen laughed and Mairin turned to offer him a frown of displeasure.</p><p>She sniffed. \u201c \u2019Tis not a laughing matter. Ewan would be most displeased if I died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is precisely why you aren\u2019t going to do anything of the sort,\u201d Ewan drawled.</p> <p>She turned her head to look at Ewan again and was startled to see him look so ... haggard. His hair was unkempt, his eyes were red, and he had what looked to be several days\u2019 worth of beard growth on his jaw.</p><p>\u201cI am ever obedient, husband. If you command me not to die, then I will of course not deny your wish.\u201d</p><p>Ewan grinned and as he looked down at her she saw such relief in his eyes that her breath caught in her throat.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis a sin to lie, wife, but \u2019tis God\u2019s truth that I don\u2019t think He or I will mind this one untruth.\u201d</p><p>She hmmphed. \u201cI try to be obedient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, lass, I did command you not to die, and it was very accommodating of you to obey me this once. I\u2019m so pleased that I might consider not shouting at you the next time you see fit not to obey me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe both of you are daft,\u201d Caelen grumbled.</p><p>Alaric moved closer to the bed and reached to squeeze her hand. \u201cWelcome back to the land of the living, little sister. You gave us all quite a scare.\u201d</p><p>She laid her other hand over her stomach. \u201cI feel no pain. \u2019Tis quite odd, really, but I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>Ewan laughed and then leaned down and pressed his lips against her forehead for the longest time. He trembled against her skin and smoothed his hand over her hair as he slowly drew away.</p><p>\u201cYou should be near to starving, lass. You\u2019ve been abed three days and you emptied the contents of your stomach on day one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree days?\u201d She was appalled. Utterly appalled.</p><p>\u201cAye, lass, three days.\u201d His tone grew more serious and the lines reappeared in his face. He looked ... tired.</p><p>She reached up to trace the lines at his brow and then let her fingers fall to his cheek. \u201cYou look tired, husband. I\u2019m thinking you need a bath and a shave and then a long rest.\u201d</p><p>He cupped his hand over hers, trapping it against his cheek. Then he turned his mouth inward and kissed her palm.</p><p>\u201cNow that you\u2019re awake, I will indeed sleep. But don\u2019t be thinking that just because you\u2019ve awakened that you\u2019ll be scurrying all over the keep. You\u2019ll stay abed until I say you can get up and not a moment before.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a look of disgust but held her tongue. It wouldn\u2019t do to start an argument with him the moment she awoke. After all, she could be accommodating on occasion.</p><p>Ewan laughed. \u201cAye, lass, it would appear that on occasion you can be very accommodating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really must learn to control my tongue better,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI can\u2019t go about blurting out my every thought. Mother Serenity said I\u2019d rue the day I ever began such a terrible habit. I\u2019m thinking she has the right of it.\u201d</p><p>Ewan leaned down and kissed her again. \u201cI\u2019m thinking your tongue is perfect.\u201d</p><p>Both Caelen and Alaric laughed and Mairin was scandalized. \u201cEwan!\u201d</p><p>Mortification tightened her cheeks and she yanked the blankets up to cover her head. Ewan joined in their laughter while she huddled there wishing the floor would open up and take them all.</p><p>Ewan eventually shooed everyone from their chamber and then ordered food brought up to them both. He sampled every bite of food himself before he passed it along to her.</p><p>In truth, it scared her spitless. She didn\u2019t want him to die for her and she told him so.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look impressed with her concern. \u201c \u2019Tis my duty to watch over you, lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a fine job you\u2019ll do if you die in the process,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>After they ate, she lay back on the pillow and closed her eyes. She really was quite weak, and it was the truth that the food didn\u2019t settle all that well in her stomach. After three days of not eating, she supposed it was only natural.</p><p>She started when she heard the door open, and a parade of serving women came into the chamber bearing pails of hot water.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might like a hot bath,\u201d Ewan said.</p><p>In that moment she wanted to throw herself around him and hug him until he had no breath. And she would if she didn\u2019t find that evenoving her arms was incredibly taxing. So she lay there like a pile of useless flesh and watched with mounting excitement as steam rose from the almost-full tub.</p><p>When the last of the water was poured from the pails, Ewan bent over the bed and began to unlace the ties on her sleeping gown. She didn\u2019t have enough energy to protest, not that it would have done her a bit of good anyway. Soon enough he had the gown off her body and he gently gathered her in his arms and carried her over to the tub.</p><p>He eased her down into the hot water, and she moaned in delight as the heat lapped over her body.</p><p>Instead of leaving her as she\u2019d anticipated, he knelt beside the tub. He reached for the pitcher on the floor and filled it with water before pouring it down her back to wet her hair.</p><p>When his fingers dug into the strands to wash her hair, she closed her eyes at the simple pleasure of having him take care of her needs. She was weaker than she could have ever imagined she would have been after her ordeal, and she was grateful for his regard.</p><p>She moaned softly as he turned his attention to the washing of her body. He took his time, rubbing her shoulders and her arms. His hands plunged into the water and he cupped her breasts, rubbing his thumbs over the hard tips.</p><p>He didn\u2019t tarry overlong but continued his relentless quest to wash every inch of her body. By the time he reached her feet, she was shivering with raw pleasure. He picked up one foot and water sluiced up her leg. Then he began a meticulous massage of each part of her foot, going from bottom to top. When he reached her toes, she tried to jerk her foot away and shrieked at the tickling sensation.</p><p>He laughed but grabbed hold of her ankle so she didn\u2019t slip away.</p><p>\u201cI had no idea you were so ticklish, lass.\u201d</p><p>He held her foot in both hands and ran his hands over her ankle and then, to her shock, he kissed the arch of her foot. He caressed a path up her leg, over her knee, and down to the juncture of her thighs.</p><p>His hands were like silk on her flesh. The combination of the soothing water and his heated caresses were a balm to her tattered senses.</p><p>He was thorough in his wash. No part of her went untouched. By the time he was done, she was limp, her vision hazy, and she was so lethargic that she couldn\u2019t have risen from the tub if she\u2019d wanted to.</p><p>Ewan picked her up and held her over the tub while the water rushed from her body. He set her by the fire and promptly wrapped a large blanket around her, tucking the ends between her breasts.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as your hair is dry, I\u2019ll tuck you back into bed,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to get cold.\u201d</p><p>Just when she couldn\u2019t imagine being more shocked by his gentle regard, he began to dry her hair with one of the drying cloths. His hands worked through the strands and when he\u2019d blotted the excess moisture from the heavy mass, he began to work a comb through the knots.</p><p>They sain front of the fire, her nestled between his thighs, facing the blaze. He was exceedingly patient, pausing when he reached a particularly difficult snarl.</p><p>The warmth from the hearth wrapped around them until her skin glowed pink. Heat seeped into her bones and she found herself nodding off as he combed her hair.</p><p>When he was done, he set the comb aside and wrapped his arms tightly around her. He pressed his cheek against the side of her head and rocked slightly as she stared into the glowing embers.</p><p>\u201cYou scared me, lass.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and melted deeper into his embrace. \u201cI scared myself, Laird. \u2019Tis the truth I had no liking of the thought of leaving you and Crispen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrispen slept in your bed each night you were ill. He on one side, I on the other. He was just as determined as I that you not die.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201c \u2019Tis nice to have family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, lass, it is. I think you and Crispen and I make a fine family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget Caelen and Alaric,\u201d she said with a frown. \u201cAnd Gannon, Cormac, and Diormid, of course. They do annoy me, but they have good intentions and they are ever so patient. Oh! And Maddie and Bertha and Christina.\u201d</p><p>Ewan chuckled against her ear. \u201cOur clan, lass. Our clan is our family.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she liked the idea of that. Family. She gave a contented sigh and leaned her head back on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cEwan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for not letting me die. \u2019Tis the truth I was close to giving up, but your bellowing made it quite impossible to give in. You do like to bellow. It probably made you happy to have an excuse to carry on so.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her to him and she felt the tremble of his body that signaled silent laughter.</p><p>\u201cWhen you are well, we\u2019re going to have a long talk.\u201d</p><p>She tried to sit up but he held her tight. \u201cTalk about what, Laird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWords, lass. Words I intend that you\u2019ll offer me.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 29</p><p>He\u2019d given her an entire fortnight in which he bullied her into resting, showered her with affection\u2014privately, of course\u2014and the loving ... Ah, the lass had quickly recovered and Ewan had spent each night driving her, and himself, mad with pleasure.</p><p>Yet she\u2019d never spoken of loving him. She was free with her comliments, he had to give her that much. She told him in the sweetest tones that he was handsome, bold, arrogant ... though he wasn\u2019t certain that she meant all of these as compliments.</p><p>She was certainly impressed with his skills at loving, and she\u2019d developed some of her own that he still hadn\u2019t fully recovered from.</p><p>She had to love him. He couldn\u2019t countenance that she felt only passing affection for him. She sure as hell wasn\u2019t obedient, nor was she particularly respectful. But he saw the way she looked at him when she thought he wasn\u2019t watching. He saw how she fell apart in his arms night after night in the darkness of their chamber.</p><p>Aye, she loved him. There was no other explanation. He just had to get her to see it.</p><p>The poisoning had made Mairin more wary, and as much as Ewan liked that she took his requests seriously, he did miss their fiery exchanges\u2014usually spawned when she disregarded an order. He didn\u2019t like that Mairin\u2019s spontaneous charm had been curtailed by her near death. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Only Ewan, his brothers, and Gannon, Cormac, and Diormid knew the truth. That Mairin hadn\u2019t been the intended victim. There were many reasons for Ewan to keep the information to himself.</p><p>One, his clan had become fiercely protective of Mairin since the incident. They all looked after her with a keen eye, and she was never alone. That suited Ewan\u2019s purposes perfectly, because whether someone was trying to kill Mairin or not, she still faced the threat that was Duncan Cameron.</p><p>Two, he had no desire for Mairin to worry, and if she found out that Ewan was the intended victim, not once but twice, there was no telling what the lass might do. Ewan had discovered in a short time that she was fierce in her protection of those she considered hers.</p><p>And the lass did consider Ewan hers, much to Ewan\u2019s smug satisfaction. She may not have given him the words he wanted to hear, but there was no denying her possessiveness when it came to him. He remembered well the look she\u2019d given him when Rionna McDonald had been introduced.</p> <p>He looked forward to the day when they would be free of threats. The shadow hanging over the keep had affected not just Mairin, but everyone. Mairin ... well, Ewan hadn\u2019t had a single report of her causing a ruckus since she\u2019d gotten up from her sickbed.</p><p>He should have known that wouldn\u2019t last ...</p><p>\u201cLaird, you must come quickly!\u201d Owain said as he ran up to Ewan.</p><p>The younger man panted as he came to a stop. It looked as if he\u2019d run the entire way from where he came.</p><p>Ewan turned from the sheepherder, who was giving him a detailed accounting of McCabe stocks, and frowned.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is amiss, Owain?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis Lady McCabe. The entire hall is in an uproar. She\u2019s ordered a group of your men to take over the women\u2019s duties!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ewan demanded. Then he put his fingers to the bridge of his nose and took in a deep breath. \u201cTell me exactly what goes on, Owain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeath angered her but I don\u2019t know what transpired, Laird. She\u2019s ordered him and the group of men with him to do the washing! And the cooking! God help us all. And cleaning the kitchens and the floors ...\u201d</p><p>Owain broke off, winded, and then plowed forward again. \u201cThey\u2019re all ready to revolt because your brothers can\u2019t control the lass.\u201d</p><p>Ewan frowned and swore under his breath. Heath was a hotheaded young soldier who\u2019d only recently come to the McCabes. He was a bastard son of Laird McKinley\u2014one of many\u2014who\u2019d been unacknowledged by his father before the laird\u2019s death. The result was that he had no home. Ewan had gathered such men over the years, adding to his numbers when so many of his own clan had been eliminated by Duncan Cameron\u2019s attack.</p> <p>Ewan had already had problems with Heath and a group of younger, cocky, arrogant soldiers who had allied themselves with Heath shortly after his arrival.</p><p>They\u2019d been disciplined before, and Ewan had already decided that it would be his last effort to turn them into McCabe warriors.</p><p>If Heath was involved, it couldn\u2019t be good. Match him to Ewan\u2019s equally hotheaded wife and an explosion was sure to follow.</p><p>\u201cWhere are my brothers?\u201d Ewan demanded.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re with Lady McCabe in the hall. \u2019Tis a very tense situation, Laird. There was a moment that I feared for the safety of Lady McCabe.\u201d</p><p>That was all Ewan needed to hear. He ran for the hall, and as he rounded the corner into the courtyard, he saw all of his men, who had been out training, standing still, their heads cocked as they listened to the din coming from inside the keep.</p><p>Ewan shoved past them, vaulted up the steps, and barged into the hall.</p><p>The scene before him was chaos. A group of younger soldiers was across the room, surrounded by Ewan\u2019s brothers and Mairin and Gertie.</p> <p>Cormac and Diormid were being roundly scolded by Gertie. Gertie was so riled that she shook a spoon at the two men and managed to hit them with it about every third stroke. Alaric and Caelen both wore expressions of fury as they sought to place Mairin behind them. But she was having none of it.</p><p>What caught Ewan\u2019s attention, however, was Mairin, who stood in the middle of the fray, her face so red from anger that she looked fair to exploding. She was on tiptoe, shouting insults at Heath from around Gannon, who was also valiantly trying to keep her at a distance.</p><p>Heath\u2019s face was purple with rage. The lass had no idea the danger she\u2019d put herself in. But Ewan knew. He\u2019d witnessed the younger man\u2019s brash temper more than once. Ewan had already started across the room when he saw Heath raise his hand.</p><p>Ewan let out a roar, drew his sword, and launched himself over the remaining space. Mairin ducked, but Heath\u2019s fist still grazed her jaw as she turned away. She went flying back just as Ewan slammed into Heath.</p><p>If Caelen and Alaric hadn\u2019t pinned both Ewan\u2019s arms back, he would have killed the younger man on the spot. As it was, Heath lay sprawled on the floor, blood dripping from his mouth.</p><p>Ewan twisted in their grip but they wouldn\u2019t let him go. \u201cLeave off!\u201d he roared.</p><p>They wrestled him back several paces before he finally managed to break their hold. He yanked his arm away and went to where Mairin was picking herself up off the floor.</p><p>He caught her elbow and helped her to her feet. Then he cupped her chin and turned it up so he could see her jaw.</p><p>\u201cHe barely touched me,\u201d Mairin whispered. \u201cTruly, Ewan, it doesn\u2019t pain me at all.\u201d</p><p>Fury sizzled over his skin. \u201cHe had no right to touch you at all! He\u2019ll die for this offense.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his hand from her face and then turned to fix the rest of the room with his glare. \u201cCan someone tell me what in God\u2019s name is going on?\u201d</p><p>Everyone started talking at once. Ewan closed his eyes and then roared for silence. He turned to Mairin. \u201cYou tell me what happened here.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at her hands but not before he saw the betraying quiver of her lip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, Laird,\u201d Diormid said loudly as he stepped forward. \u201cShe ordered Heath, Robert, Corbin, Ian, and Matthew to take on the tasks of the women.\u201d The disbelief and outrage Diormid felt on behalf of his men was evident. \u201cShe instructed them all to do the cooking and the cleaning and the scrubbing of the floors!\u201d</p><p>Ewan watched as Mairin\u2019s expression went flat. Her lips drew into a thin line, and then she simply turned away and would have walked out of the hall if Ewan hadn\u2019t quickly caught hold of her arm to prevent her departure.</p><p>\u201cLass?\u201d he asked pointedly.</p><p>Her chin wobbled, and she blinked furiously. \u201cYou\u2019ll just yell, Laird, and I have no desire to be humiliated again in front of my clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d he said in a stern voice. He was determined that he not show weakness in front of his men. What he wanted to do was pull her into his arms and kiss those trembling lips. She was on the verge of tears, and he\u2019d do damn near anything to prevent her crying.</p><p>But what he had to do was be fair and disciplined. He had a duty to everyone involved to be fair and impartial, which meant that if his wife had hatched another of her hare-brained schemes, he was destined to make her cry.</p><p>Her chin went up, which relieved him. He far preferred her belligerence to her tears.</p><p>0em\"&gt;</p><p>She pointed at Heath. \u201cThat ... That idiot struck Christina.\u201d</p><p>Ewan stiffened and jerked around to see Heath helped to his feet by Diormid.</p><p>\u201cIs this true?\u201d Ewan asked in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cThe bitch was impertinent,\u201d Heath growled. \u201cShe deserved my reprimand.\u201d</p><p>Mairin gasped in outrage. She would have flown at Heath again but Ewan caught her by the waist and yanked her to his chest. Her feet kicked at his ankles but he wouldn\u2019t let her go. He turned to Alaric and thrust Mairin into his arms.</p><p>\u201cDo not let her go,\u201d Ewan ordered.</p><p>Alaric wrapped his arm around her waist and simply held her against his chest, her feet inches from the floor. Mairin looked outraged, but Ewan was more interested in Heath\u2019s explanation.</p><p>He turned back to Heath once more and pinned him with the full force of his stare. \u201cYou will tell me everything.\u201d</p><p>Mairin struggled in Alaric\u2019s arms but he held her fast. \u201cEwan, please,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cI would tell you all that happened.\u201d</p><p>She was beyond furious. She was so sickened by the men\u2019s treatment of the serving women that she was ready to take Ewan\u2019s sword and gut them all. If she could lift it, she\u2019d do just that.</p><p>She turned to Alaric when Ewan continued to ignore her. \u201cAlaric, may I borrow your sword?\u201d</p><p>Alaric raised a startled brow. \u201cLass, you couldn\u2019t lift my sword.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could help me. Please, Alaric, I\u2019ve a need to shed some blood.\u201d</p><p>To her surprise, he laughed outright, the sound loud in the quiet room.</p><p>Tears of frustration pricked her eyes. \u201cPlease, Alaric, \u2019tis not right what he did. And now he\u2019ll make excuses to Ewan for his disgraceful behavior, for all their behavior.\u201d</p><p>Alaric\u2019s gaze softened. \u201cEwan will take care of this, lass. He is a fair man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s a man,\u201d she persisted.</p><p>Alaric shot her a puzzled look. \u201cAye, I just said so.\u201d</p><p>Before Ewan could again demand an explanation from Heath, the hall erupted once more. Women poured into the room, their cries rivaling that of any warrior. To Mairin\u2019s astonishment, they held an assortment of makeshift weapons, from pitchforks and sticks to rocks and daggers.</p><p>Ewan\u2019s mouth gaped open just as Alaric finally let Mairin loose from his grasp. She landed with a thump on the floor and cast a disgruntled glare in Alaric\u2019s direction. But he, like every other man, turned to stare in astonishment as the women converged on them.</p><p>\u201cLass, are you all right?\u201d Bertha demanded from the front of the crowd of women.</p><p>Christina hurried over to Mairin, grabbed her hand, then gestured for Maddie before pulling Mairin to the assembled women.</p><p>Mairin squeezed Christina\u2019s hand as she stared at the darkening bruise on Christina\u2019s cheek. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d Mairin whispered.</p><p>Christina smiled. \u201cAye, thanks to you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaird, we be wanting a word from you,\u201d Bertha bellowed.</p><p>She waved her pitchfork for emphasis as Ewan continued to stare at the women in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Ewan demanded. \u201cHas the entire world gone mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour men behaved reprehensibly,\u201d Mairin said.</p><p>The women voiced their agreement by waving their weapons and stomping their feet. Ewan\u2019s men looked as if they didn\u2019t know whether to be afraid or angry.</p><p>Ewan folded his arms over his chest and looked sternly at her. \u201cWhat did they do, lass?\u201d</p><p>Mairin glanced at the other women, drawing courage from their support. Then she jutted out her chin and pinned the laird with her best impression of his scowl. It must have been a worthy impression because he lifted an eyebrow as he stared back at her.</p><p>\u201cThe women were all doing their duties, just as you expect the men to do. That idiot over there decided to test his charms on Christina and the lass refused him. He was so furious over the rejection that he began to criticize her work. You see, she was serving the soldiers their afternoon meal. Thus began an effort to belittle and demean the work of every woman in this keep. They made jests and grew louder and louder in their criticism. They bellowed at Maddie when the food wasn\u2019t served soon enough. They complained about Gertie\u2019s preparation when they felt the food was not savory enough or it was too cold.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a long breath before she spilled forth the rest of her ire.</p><p>\u201cAnd when Christina sought to diffuse the situation, Heath tripped her. She spilled ale everywhere and then he had the nerve to chasten her for ruining his clothing. When she protested, he slapped her.\u201d</p><p>Mairin\u2019s hands curled in fury as she stepped forward, her entire body shaking with rage. She pointed at the group comprised of Heath, Robert, Corbin, Ian, and Matthew. \u201cAnd not one, not one of them stepped in to help her. Not one! No one moved a finger to stop his abuse of Christina. They were too busy laughing and criticizing women\u2019s work.\u201d</p><p>She stopped in front of the laird and poked her finger into his chest. \u201cWell, I say if \u2019tis so easy and the men are so critical, they can take over the women\u2019s duties for the day and we\u2019ll see how well they perform the women\u2019s tasks.\u201d</p><p>She held her breath and waited for Ewan to denounce her.</p><p>\u201cI would speak, Laird!\u201d Bertha yelled out, her voice so loud that more than one woman winced.</p><p>\u201cYou may speak,\u201d Ewan said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll not go overlong with my comments, but hear this. As of this moment, the women are not lifting a finger in this keep. And we\u2019re keeping Lady McCabe!\u201d</p><p>Ewan lifted his brow again. \u201cYou\u2019re keeping her?\u201d</p><p>Bertha nodded. \u201cAye, she\u2019s going with us. We\u2019ll not have her chastised for her defense of us.\u201d</p><p>To Mairin\u2019s surprise, he smiled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a problem with that, Bertha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d Bertha demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m keeping her.\u201d</p><p>That statement caused a series of murmurs to race through the hall. Both the men and the women leaned forward, curious as to which way the laird would rule. It was clear he was displeased.</p> <p>\u201cI will not be swayed by blackmail and demands,\u201d he said.</p><p>When Bertha puffed out her chest and prepared to launch into another angry tirade, he held up a hand to silence her.</p><p>\u201cI will hear what both sides have to say before I render judgment. Once I do, the matter will be final. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you decide the right way,\u201d Mairin muttered.</p><p>Ewan shot her a quelling look.</p> <p>The laird turned and it was the truth that he didn\u2019t look pleased as he stared at Heath and the four younger men who stood defiantly by his side. Then he looked to Gannon, who was the most senior of all his men.</p><p>\u201cHave you an explanation for this?\u201d</p><p>Gannon sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Laird. I was not present. I was in the courtyard with some of the other soldiers. I had informed them they wouldn\u2019t eat until they performed their maneuvers correctly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He turned to Cormac, who stood to the side of Diormid and Heath. \u201cCormac? Have you anything to offer?\u201d</p><p>Cormac looked furious. He glanced between the men, who stared expectantly at him, and Ewan, who also awaited his word.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis as our mistress reported, Laird,\u201d he said through tight lips. \u201cI came into the hall just as Heath tripped Christina.\u201d Anger rippled across Cormac\u2019s face as he glanced over at Heath. \u201c \u2019Twas not Christina\u2019s fault. The men grew louder with their insults and when Christina offered disagreement, Heath struck her. \u0201 God\u2019s truth I would have killed him myself, but Lady McCabe intervened before I could act, and then my foremost concern was her safety.\u201d</p> <p>Ewan nodded his agreement over Cormac\u2019s assessment, then looked over to where Diormid stood beside Heath. \u201cAnd do you defend his actions?\u201d</p><p>Diormid looked torn in his loyalty to the young men directly under his command. \u201cNay, Laird. \u2019Twas not the tale as he told it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you weren\u2019t present for the happenings?\u201d Ewan asked.</p><p>Diormid shook his head. \u201cI entered the hall as Lady McCabe was issuing orders for the men to take over the women\u2019s duties for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you commend his actions? Do you stand by them?\u201d Ewan asked.</p><p>Diormid hesitated before finally saying, \u201cNay, Laird. I am shamed by them.\u201d</p><p>Then Ewan turned to Bertha. \u201cYou may take the women and retire to your cottages. Or however else you\u2019d like to spend your day of leisure. Robert, Corbin, Ian, and Matthew will see to your duties.\u201d</p><p>Mairin frowned at the omission of Heath, but the cheers from the women prevented her from voicing her displeasure.</p> <p>Equally explosive were the shouts of dismay from the four Ewan had sentenced to the women\u2019s work. They looked so appalled that it was all Mairin could do not to smile her satisfaction.</p><p>Bertha beamed at Mairin. \u201cCome, lass, you must celebrate with us.\u201d</p><p>Mairin turned to leave the hall with the women when Ewan cleared his throat. Slowly she turned around and peeked up at the laird. Surely he wasn\u2019t angry with her. Not after having heard the full story.</p><p>His expression was still stern as he crooked his finger at her. With a sigh, she left Bertha to go to her husband. The women remained in the hall, either curious over what the laird wanted or to defend Mairin from reprimand. Mairin wasn\u2019t sure, but she was grateful for their support.</p><p>When she was a respectable distance, she stopped and folded her hands in front of her. \u201cYou wanted me?\u201d</p><p>He crooked his finger again, and she huffed as she moved even closer. He stretched out his finger and touched her chin, prodding until she was looking directly up at him.</p><p>\u201cYou have instructions for me, Laird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, lass, I do.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head farther back and waited for his order.</p><p>His fingers trailed over her chin to her jaw where Heath\u2019s fist had grazed her. Then he delved into the hair over her ear, his hand cupping the back of her head in his possessive grasp.</p><p>\u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>font size=\"+1\"&gt;CHAPTER 30</p><p>Mairin was so relieved that she threw herself into Ewan\u2019s arms and fused her mouth hotly to his.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t trust me, lass.\u201d</p><p>His voice was reprimanding as he tasted her lips again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou did look as if you wanted to yell at me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaird, you cannot mean for us to do the women\u2019s chores!\u201d</p><p>Ewan turned sharply at Robert\u2019s protest.</p><p>\u201cIndeed, I do. If any man has a problem with my command, they are free to leave the keep.\u201d</p><p>Heath\u2019s lips turned up into a snarl and Mairin automatically moved farther into Ewan\u2019s hold. The man made her nauseous, and the hatred in his eyes frightened her.</p><p>\u201cWhat of Heath?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy was he pardoned from the women\u2019s work?\u201d</p><p>The scowl that blackened Ewan\u2019s face terrified her. \u201cStay with Alaric.\u201d</p><p>He actually deposited her between Alaric and Caelen before stalking over to where Heath stood. Their shoulders closed in front of her and she stood up on tiptoe, bobbing left and right in an effort to see over or through the two brothers.</p><p>When Ewan reached Heath, he didn\u2019t say a word. He drew back and rammed his fist into Heath\u2019s face. Heath fell like a rock. He groaned piteously when Ewan gathered his shirt in his hands and hauled him back up again.</p><p>\u201cThat was for Christina,\u201d Ewan snarled.</p><p>Then he rammed his knee right between Heath\u2019s legs. Alaric and Caelen both winced. Gannon turned white and Cormac flinched and looked away.</p><p>\u201cThat was for my wife.\u201d</p><p>He dropped Heath on the floor, where he promptly curled into a ball. Why, Mairin could swear the man was weeping.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be weeping, too, lass,\u201d Alaric murmured.</p><p>Ewan turned and addressed Gannon in chilling tones. \u201cHe dies. Take him away.\u201d</p><p>Heath blanched at the death sentence and began begging in hoarse tones. The assembled warriors winced and showed their disgust at the piteous way Heath behaved.</p><p>\u201cAye, Laird. Immediately.\u201d</p><p>Gannon bent and hauled Heath to his feet, and he and Cormac dragged him from the hall, Heath still hunched over in pain.</p><p>Ewan then turned his attention to the celebrating and ren. \u201cMy apologies, Christina, that you suffered such injustice. I do not condone, nor will I accept such behavior from my men. Enjoy your free day from your duties. I doubt my men will do the job you would do in their stead, but the work will be done.\u201d</p><p>Mairin\u2019s heart swelled with pride. She was so thrilled by the sincerity in Ewan\u2019s evenly voiced words that her eyes stung and watered. She gripped Caelen\u2019s and Alaric\u2019s arms until her knuckles turned white.</p><p>Caelen carefully pried her fingers from his elbow and then rolled his eyes when he noticed her tears. \u201cWhat on earth are you crying for, lass?\u201d</p><p>She sniffled and scrubbed her face against Alaric\u2019s shirt sleeve. \u201c \u2019Tis a wonderful thing he\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>Alaric pushed at her head and scowled until she stopped wiping her tears on him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good man,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOf course he is,\u201d Caelen said loyally.</p><p>Having settled the matter, Ewan walked over to where Mairin stood. Uncaring of how it looked or the fact that he hadn\u2019t invited her this time, she launched herself around Alaric and Caelen and catapulted into Ewan\u2019s arms. She peppered his face with a barrage of kisses and latched onto his neck and squeezed for all she was worth.</p><p>\u201cLet me breathe, lass,\u201d Ewan said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered into his ear. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>And suddenly he was squeezing her every bit as hard as she squeezed him. To her utter shock, he turned and hauled her out of the hall. He took the stairs two at a time and burst into their chamber just moments later.</p><p>After he kicked the door shut with his foot, he stared fiercely down at her, his grip so tight around her that she couldn\u2019t squeeze out a single breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he asked hoarsely.</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise at his vehemence.</p><p>\u201cJust a moment ago. In the hall. What did you say into my ear?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed nervously and fidgeted in his arms. Then she gathered her courage as tightly around her as he held her. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis about damn time,\u201d he growled.</p><p>She blinked in confusion. \u201c \u2019Tis about time for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe words. You finally said them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I only just realized,\u201d she said in bewilderment.</p><p>\u201cI knew it already,\u201d he said with smug satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cYou did not. I didn\u2019t even harw it, so how could you?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cSo tell me, lass, how did you plan to spend your afternoon of leisure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll go find Crispen and play with him and the other children.\u201d</p><p>Ewan shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNay?\u201d she questioned.</p><p>\u201cNay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve decided that an afternoon of leisure sounds extremely appealing.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in astonishment. \u201cYou have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. I wondered if perhaps you were willing to be leisurely with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis a sin to be slothful,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAye, but what I have in mind has nothing to do with being a sloth.\u201d</p><p>She blushed furiously at the suggestion in his voice. \u201cYou\u2019ve never taken the afternoon off from your duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy most important duty is to see to the needs of my wife.\u201d He cupped the area of her cheek where Heath had struck her, and his gaze darkened.</p><p>\u201cDo you really mean to kill him, Ewan?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Ewan scowled. \u201cHe struck you. You are wife to the laird, mistress of this keep. I tolerate no disrespect and I damn sure will kill any man who ever touches you.\u201d</p><p>Mairin twisted her hands, guilt surging through her. \u201cI provoked him shamelessly. I called him terrible names. I used words no lady should ever use. Mother Serenity would wash my mouth out with soap.\u201d</p><p>Ewan sighed. \u201cWhat would you have me do, Mairin? He\u2019s been a problem before today. He\u2019d already used up his allotment of chances. Even if he hadn\u2019t struck you, I would not tolerate him raising a hand to another woman in this clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you banish him? I would think that a man with no home and no means would suffer far more than if you offered him a quick and easy death. Maybe he\u2019ll starve to death or a pack of wolves will descend upon him.\u201d</p><p>Ewan reared back in surprise and then he laughed, the throaty sound sending prickles of delight down Mairin\u2019s spine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bloodthirsty lass.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAye, Alaric said as much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it important that I not do the killing, Mairin? \u2019Tis my right as laird and as your husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I feel at fault for provokrougm so. If he hadn\u2019t struck me, you wouldn\u2019t have ordered his death for striking Christina. Not that you wouldn\u2019t have punished him,\u201d she rushed to say.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019d rather he be ravaged by a pack of wolves.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cSo be it, lass. I\u2019ll have Gannon escort him off our lands with the order never to return.\u201d</p><p>She threw her arms around him and squeezed as hard as she could. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her away and then leaned down to kiss the tip of her nose. \u201cSay it again.\u201d</p><p>She twisted her lips and scowled up at him. \u201cYou\u2019re a demanding man, Laird.\u201d</p><p>His lips found hers and he drank deeply, rubbing his tongue over her mouth until she opened to let him in.</p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>With a low groan, he gathered her in his arms and walked her back until her legs hit the edge of the bed. He swept her down and then rolled until she was sprawled indelicately atop him. He pushed at her clothing, baring first her shoulders and then her arms. He gripped her upper arms and pulled her down so that he nuzzled her neck. Ah, but his lips were magic.</p><p>Determined that he wouldn\u2019t be the only one doing the torturing, she bent and ran her tongue over the thick cords in his neck. Smiling when he flinched and went rigid underneath her, she sank her teeth into his flesh, inhaling his male scent. She savored his taste, rolling her tongue over every line and dip.</p><p>\u201cMairin?\u201d</p><p>She leaned up so she could look down into Ewan\u2019s eyes. \u201cAye, husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a particular fondness for this dress?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWell nay, \u2019tis a work gown after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before she could think on his meaning, he ripped the material from her bodice all the way past her waist.

As soon as he was naked, he pulled the remaining tatters of her dress from her body and then rolled her back on top of him.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis an odd position, husband. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t have the way of it.\u201d</p><p>He traced a line from her temple over her cheek and to her lips. \u201cAye, lass, I have the right of it. Today the women are in charge and the men are doing the work. It only seems right that you should be on top. I am your humble servant.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. She thought on what he\u2019d said, pursed her lips, and then finally shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not at all sure such a thing is possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh aye, \u2019tis possible, lass. Not only is it possible, but \u2019tis a marvelous experience.\u201d</p><p>He gripped her hips, lifting to position her over his groin.</p><p>\u201cPut your hand down, lass. Guide me in.\u201d</p><p>She trembled with excitement and anticipation. Her legs quivered and jumped against his sides as she reached down and grasped his hardness.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, lass, just like that. Hold me just right there. Let me fit you to me.\u201d</p><p>He moved her, holding her still as the tip of his cock brushed through her damp heat. Then he found the entrance and slid in the tiniest bit. Her eyes flew open and she tensed as he began to breach her opening.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he soothed.</p><p>He guided her down and she removed her hand and placed both palms on his chest. She leaned forward as his fingers slid from her hips over her buttocks. He gripped her flesh and spread her wider as he slid deeper.</p><p>With one final push, her bottom met the tops of his thighs. It was an unsettling sensation, being speared, so full with no relief. Her body hummed with pleasure. Her nipples tightened into hard points, pouting and begging for his touch.</p><p>He obliged her, leaving her hips and feathering his fingers over her belly up until he cupped both breasts in his palms. Little sparks of fire sizzled through her body when he thumbed the taut buds. He teased and coaxed until they were painfully rigid.</p><p>\u201cRide me,\u201d he said huskily.</p><p>The image of doing such a thing exploded in her mind. A hot flush worked through her core until she squirmed and gripped him even tighter in her sheath.</p><p>Eager to do his bidding, she began to move, tentatively at first. She felt awkward and shy but the look in Ewan\u2019s eyes gave her all the confidence she needed to continue.</p><p>Back and forth she rocked, rising up and then easing down. They both made contented sounds that became more desperate and urgent as she picked up her pace.</p><p>Delighting in her newfound freedom, she proceeded to drive them both beyond the bounds of reason. She smiled seductively down at her husband when he pleaded with her to stop tormenting him.</p> <p>With her lips fused to his as tightly as their bodies were joined, they found their release. She swallowed his cry of triumph as he swallowed her cry of ecstasy. His fingers dug into her hips and he pulled her down, holding her there ase emptied himself into her body.</p><p>With a sigh, she collapsed on top of him and burrowed into his warmth. His heart pounded frantically against hers until she wasn\u2019t sure whose beat harder. He wrapped his arms around her and kissed the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Mairin.\u201d</p><p>For a moment she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d heard correctly. Aye, she loved him. More than she\u2019d imagined loving a man. But she hadn\u2019t dreamed that he\u2019d return her feelings. He was affectionate with her. Loving, even. But she hadn\u2019t ever expected that he\u2019d offer her his heart.</p><p>Tears filled her eyes as she rose up, her hair falling over his chest while she stared down at him in wonder.</p><p>\u201cSay it again,\u201d she said huskily.</p><p>He smiled at hearing his own words tossed back at him.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ewan,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, lass. I\u2019d do just about anything to keep you from crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis happy tears.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cYou\u2019ve made me so happy, Ewan. You\u2019ve given me a home and family. A clan to call my own. And you stood behind me today when I feared you\u2019d denounce me in front of everyone.\u201d</p><p>He frowned and shook his head. \u201cI always stand behind you, wife. I may not always agree with you, and there will be times that I may not make a decision you agree with, but I always stand behind you.\u201d</p><p>She hugged him again and pressed her face into his neck. \u201cOh, I do love you so, Ewan.\u201d</p><p>He rolled until they were on their sides facing each other. He touched her face, stroking the wispy tendrils of hair from her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve waited a long time for you to say those words, lass. And now that I have, I\u2019m never going to grow tired of them.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201c \u2019Tis a good thing, Laird, for I have this problem with saying the least thing that runs through my mind, and \u2019tis a fact I\u2019ll be thinking of how much I love you often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should show me,\u201d he said in a husky, aroused voice.</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cAgain?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and kissed her. \u201cAye, lass, again.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 31</p><p>Mairin slowly dragged herself out of bed and headed straight for the chamber pot where she vomited what little remained in her belly from the night before.</p><p>Ias a miserable occurrence and had happened like clockwork every morning for the last fortnight. Only it didn\u2019t end there. She vomited promptly after the morning meal, then again after the noon meal, and usually at least once before bed.</p><p>She\u2019d hidden her condition from Ewan for as long as possible, but with all the vomiting and the way she eyed food as if she were being poisoned again, it was inevitable that he found out.</p><p>She would tell him today of her suspicions. Not that they were actually suspicions because it seemed obvious to her that she was carrying his child, and God knew, Ewan had put enough effort into the task of impregnating her.</p><p>The entire clan would greet the news with joy. With her dowry to be delivered at any time, prosperity would finally visit their keep. A pregnancy and safe delivery of a child would seal the McCabe control of Neamh \u00c1lainn.</p><p>She fairly danced with excitement over the idea of telling Ewan the news.</p><p>After washing out her mouth and getting dressed, Mairin headed below stairs where she was met by Gannon. She raised her eyebrows in surprise when she saw him because since her poisoning, Ewan had made it a point to have either himself or one of his brothers guarding her every moment of every day. It was a fact she was resigned to and had accepted with good grace.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, my lady,\u201d Gannon said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Gannon. Tell me, what have you done to anger your laird?\u201d</p><p>Gannon blinked and eyed her with confusion. Then he laughed as he realized she was jesting with him over his duty.</p><p>\u201cNothing, my lady, \u2019tis the truth I volunteered for the chore of looking after you today. The laird and his brothers have gone out to greet the McDonalds.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows rose again. Any talk of the McDonalds had been dispensed with after her poisoning. Why, she\u2019d even forgotten the matter of an alliance herself. The McDonalds\u2019 departure was not on pleasant terms, so the idea that they had returned made her very curious.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cUnloading the stores of food from the wagon,\u201d Gannon said with a smile.</p><p>Mairin clasped her hands in delight. \u201cSo they made good on that ridiculous wager?\u201d</p><p>Gannon rolled his eyes. \u201cOf course. \u2019Tis a peace offering, too. The two clans must soothe over any bad feelings if we are to ally ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s wonderful. Surely this will carry us to the winter months.\u201d</p><p>Gannon nodded. \u201cAnd beyond, if the hunt continues to be successful.\u201d</p><p>And if her dowry would come, the clan would have warm clothing for the winter. The children would have shoes. They would eat instead of worrying about where their next meal would come from.</p><p>This was very welcome news.</p><p>\u201cWhere might I find Ewan?\u201d she asked Gannon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m to escort you to him when you rise.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWell then, I\u2019ve risen, so let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and guided her outside to where the McDonald wagons had been driven into the courtyard. Men were unloading the supplies and taking them to the larder.</p><p>Ewan was absorbed in conversation with McDonald, and Mairin frowned as she scanned the people littering the courtyard. Then her gaze fell on Rionna and she brightened.</p><p>She started to call out and wave when Ewan caught her eye and motioned her over.</p><p>He pulled her to his side when she approached. \u201cLaird McDonald wished to give you his regards. They aren\u2019t staying and have only arrived to deliver the supplies. Since we are in agreement over Alaric\u2019s marriage to Rionna, we\u2019ll meet later in the summer to celebrate the arrangement and announce their betrothal.\u201d</p><p>Mairin smiled at the laird, who took her hand and bowed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m relieved that you are back in full health, my lady. I look forward to the time that our clans are united not only by alliance but by marriage bond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs do I,\u201d she said. \u201cSafe journey to you and I look forward to seeing you when you return.\u201d</p><p>When one of the men walked by with the gutted carcass of a stag, Mairin\u2019s stomach revolted. Her cheeks puffed out as she sucked air through her nose to keep from vomiting there in front of Ewan and Laird McDonald. There\u2019d already been far too much drama the last time the laird visited, and she had no desire to start another fracas by losing the contents of her stomach all over his boots.</p><p>She hastily made the excuse that she needed to see Gertie so she could supervise the storing of the provisions and bolted before Ewan could remark.</p><p>Once inside the keep, she took in long, steadying breaths and then made her way to the kitchens. It wasn\u2019t a complete fabrication. She did want to know Gertie\u2019s plans for the sudden surplus of food, and she also thought it would be a nice surprise to plan a special meal for the occasion.</p><p>Predictably, Gertie was grumbling over a large cauldron of stew when Mairin entered the kitchen. Gertie stopped periodically to taste, then she\u2019d groan and add another vegetable.</p><p>Gertie looked up and frowned when she saw Mairin. \u201cYou\u2019re looking peaked, lass. I saved you a bowl from the morning meal. Are you still feeling poorly every time you eat?\u201d</p><p>Touched by her thoughtfulness, Mairin placed a hand on her stomach. \u201cAye, I\u2019m afraid so. \u2019Tis the truth, not much seems appetizing to me these days.\u201d</p><p>Gertie tsked and shook her head. \u201cWhen are you going to tell laird that you\u2019re carrying his child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon. I wanted to be sure.\u201d</p><p>Gertie rolled her eyes. \u201cLass, no one retches as much as you have for as long as you have if they\u2019re ill. By now they\u2019d either die or get better.\u201d</p><p>Mairin smiled and put a hand to her middle. \u201cAye, \u2019tis true, still I didn\u2019t want to chance telling the laird something that was false. So much rides on this little one\u2019s shoulders.\u201d</p><p>Gertie\u2019s expression softened. \u201cYou have a good heart, lass. Our clan has much to be thankful for since you came to us. It almost seems too good to be true.\u201d</p><p>Embarrassed by the other woman\u2019s praise, Mairin directed the conversation to the matter at hand.</p><p>\u201cI thought to plan a special meal since Laird McDonald made good on his wager. It seems all we\u2019ve eaten of late is rabbit stew. I\u2019m sure the men would love to have fresh venison and vegetables. Surely we could spare a little for celebration without depleting our stores to dangerous levels again.\u201d</p><p>Gertie smiled broadly and reached over to pat Mairin on the arm. \u201cI was thinking the same thing myself, lass. I already had in mind to make venison pies, with your permission, of course. With the salt that Laird McDonald provided, we no longer have to spare every grain for preserving. \u2019Twill make the meal taste delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful! I\u2019ll leave the planning in your capable hands. I\u2019ve promised Crispen that I\u2019d throw skipping stones over the loch with him this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wait but a moment, I\u2019ll give you some bread to take. It will settle your stomach and give you and Crispen a snack for the afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Gertie wrapped several small loaves into a cloth sack and handed it to Mairin. \u201cOff with you now, lass. Go and have a good time with Crispen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Mairin said as she turned to go.</p><p>Her heart light, and giddy over the idea of telling Ewan of her pregnancy, she went outside to find Crispen.</p><p>The sun\u2019s rays shone bright and she turned her face up, seeking more of their warmth. She paused for a moment to watch the McDonalds file across the bridge to the other side of the loch. Her gaze sought Ewan but he was already off on another duty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She headed around the corner of the keep, searching the shores of the loch for a sign of Crispen. He was standing on a rock outcropping a distance away, his small body outlined in the sun. He stood alone, throwing stones across the surface of the water. He\u2019d watch as the stone traveled, seemingly mesmerized by the way it progressed across the loch. His laughter rang out so pure and untarnished that Mairin\u2019s heart seized. Was there anything more beautiful than a child\u2019s joy?</p><p>She looked to the day when Crispen would lead his brother or sister to the loch to throw stones. The two would laugh and plaogether. Like a family.</p><p>Smiling, she started forward, looking on the ground for appropriate stones as she went. She gathered half a dozen before arriving to where Crispen stood.</p><p>\u201cMama!\u201d</p> <p>There was no description for the sheer joy that gripped her whenever he called her mother.</p><p>He ran into her arms and she hugged him close, spilling her rocks in the process.</p><p>Laughing, he bent down to help her retrieve them, exclaiming over the perfection of one or two stones as he examined them.</p><p>\u201cI want to throw this one,\u201d he said, holding up a particularly flat rock.</p><p>\u201cGo on then. I wager you can\u2019t make it skip more than eight times.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes lit up as she knew they would at the challenge she\u2019d set forth. \u201cI can do nine,\u201d he boasted.</p><p>\u201cOh ho! How you boast. Deeds are much stronger than words. Let me see your prowess firsthand.\u201d</p><p>His chin set and concentration knitting his eyebrows, he lined up his shot and then set the rock flying. It struck the water and skipped in rapid succession toward the other bank.</p><p>\u201cOne! Two! Three!\u201d He paused for breath but his gaze never left the progression of the rock. \u201cSix! Seven ... eight ... nine!\u201d He turned. \u201cMama, I did it! Nine times!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely a record,\u201d she said, acknowledging his feat.</p><p>\u201cYou try now,\u201d he urged.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I can\u2019t hope to best someone as skilled as you.\u201d</p><p>He stuck his chest out and he smiled smugly. Then he brightened and took her hand. \u201cI bet you do well ... for a woman.\u201d</p><p>In response she tussled his hair. \u201cYou must stop listening to the ideas of your Uncle Caelen, Crispen. It will not endear you to the ladies in the future.\u201d</p><p>He wrinkled his nose and stuck out his tongue, making a gagging noise. \u201cGirls are awful. Except you, Mama.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and hugged him to her again. \u201cI\u2019m ever so happy that I\u2019m not considered an awful girl.\u201d</p><p>He tucked a perfectly flat, smooth rock into her hand. \u201cTry it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. After all, the honor of all women rests in my hands.\u201d</p><p>Crispen giggled at her dramatics as she elaborately lined up her shot. After a few test swings of her arm, she let fly and watched as the rock sailed far, hitting the surface and kicking up water as it bounced.</p> <p>Beside her Crispen counted under his eath. \u201cEight! Mama, you did eight! That\u2019s brilliant!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, I did it!\u201d</p><p>They hugged and she whirled him around until they were both dizzy. They collapsed onto the ground in a fit of giggles, and Mairin tickled Crispen until he begged for mercy.</p><p>On the hillside that overlooked the loch, Ewan walked up behind Gannon and Cormac, who stood watch over Mairin and Crispen. He watched as they wrestled on the ground, hearing the joyous sound of their laughter ring out over the land. He smiled and pondered how fortunate he was. He had gained so much in such a short time. No matter that multiple threats shadowed their existence. He took moments like these and held them close.</p><p>Love was very precious indeed.</p><p>Ewan trudged wearily up the stairs and let himself quietly into his chamber. Some of the fatigue dissipated and the strain he\u2019d been under lifted away as he gazed upon his sleeping wife.</p><p>She was sprawled indelicately, facedown, her arms spread out over the bed. She slept just like she did everything else. Full out. No reservations.</p><p>He stripped out of his clothing and climbed into bed with her. She snuggled into his arms without ever opening her eyes. She was exhausted often these days, a fact that hadn\u2019t gone unnoticed by him. Neither had all the retching the poor lass had done over the last few weeks.</p><p>She had yet to tell him of her pregnancy, and he didn\u2019t know if it was because she didn\u2019t want to burden him with how ill she was feeling, or if she truly hadn\u2019t yet realized it herself.</p><p>He rubbed a hand down her side and over her hip before sliding it between their bodies to rest over her still slim abdomen where their child rested. A child that represented so much hope for the future of his clan.</p><p>He kissed Mairin\u2019s brow, smiling as he remembered her and Crispen skipping stones on the loch. She stirred against him and sleepily opened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you were coming to bed tonight, Laird.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201c \u2019Tis actually quite early. You just went to sleep much earlier than usual.\u201d</p><p>She yawned and burrowed closer, twining her legs with his. \u201cHas an agreement been made regarding Alaric\u2019s marriage?\u201d</p><p>Ewan stroked a hand through her hair. \u201cAye. Alaric has agreed to the match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll miss him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019ll miss having him here as my right hand. But this is a great opportunity for him to rule his own lands and clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Rionna? Is she satisfied with the match?\u201d</p><p>Ewan\u2019s brow crinkled. \u201cI don\u2019t concern myself with what McDonald\u2019s daughter is satisfied with. The marriage is set. She\u2019ll do her dutyed with;</p><p>Mairin rolled her eyes, but Ewan, unwilling to be at odds with her on a night he wanted only to hold her in his arms, kissed her long and deep. \u201cI prefer to discuss other matters, wife.\u201d</p><p>She pushed back just a little and viewed him with skepticism. \u201cWhat things, husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike when you\u2019re going to tell me that we\u2019re expecting a child.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went soft and glowed warmly in the light from the hearth. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019ve been sleeping far more than usual. You\u2019re usually unconscious by the time I come to bed at night. And you can\u2019t keep anything you eat down.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose in distaste. \u201cI hadn\u2019t intended for you to know of my retching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should know by now that you can\u2019t hide anything from me, lass. Everything you do is my concern and I\u2019d rather hear it from you when you aren\u2019t feeling well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling quite well now,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He raised one eyebrow before capturing her lips in a long kiss. \u201cJust how well?\u201d he murmured back.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I might need some loving to make me feel completely myself.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her cheek and tenderly rubbed his thumb over her mouth. \u201cBy all means, we can\u2019t have you feeling anything but yourself. The keep wouldn\u2019t know what to do if you weren\u2019t driving them daft at every moment.\u201d</p><p>She balled her fist and pounded him on the chest. He hugged her tightly to him and their laughter filtered through their closed door.</p><p>Down the hall, Alaric quietly closed his door so the sound wouldn\u2019t invade his sanctuary. He sat on the edge of the bed and stared out the window at the stars hanging low on the horizon.</p><p>He envied his brother. He took such delight in his marriage and his wife. Mairin was a woman like no other.</p><p>He\u2019d told the truth when he told his brother that he wasn\u2019t ready for marriage. Perhaps he\u2019d never be. Because he\u2019d decided as soon as he watched his brother fall hard for his new bride that he\u2019d never settle for less in his own relationship than the one Ewan and Mairin shared. Only now he wasn\u2019t offered a choice. His clan needed him. His brother needed him. And he\u2019d never refuse Ewan anything.</p><p>CHAPTER 32</p><p>Over the next weeks, the weather grew warmer and Mairin spent as much time outside the keep as she could. Though she wouldn\u2019t admit as much to Ewan, she kept a sharp eye to the horizon, watching for when her dowry would be brought by the king\u2019s escort.</p><p>Ewan\u2019s missive to the king had gone unanswered thus far, but Mairin held hope that any day they would hear the news that the dowry had been carried to McCabe land.</p><p>Her belly had pooched ever so slightly. It wasn\u2019t noticeable under the full skirts of her dress, but at night, naked, beneath Ewan, he delighted in the tiny swell that harbored his child.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t keep his hands or his mouth from the mound. He\u2019d palm and caress it and then kiss every inch of her flesh. His obvious joy over her pregnancy brought Mairin great satisfaction. Her clan\u2019s joy over the announcement warmed her to her toes.</p><p>When Ewan had stood during the evening meal and announced Mairin\u2019s pregnancy, the hall had erupted in cheers. The word raced throughout the keep and a celebration ensued, lasting well into the night.</p><p>Aye, life was good. Nothing could mar this day for Mairin. She patted her belly, breathed in the perfumed air, and set off for the courtyard, eager to get a glimpse of her husband training.</p><p>As she descended the hill, she looked up and caught her breath. Her heart pounded furiously as she watched the distant riders galloping toward the McCabe keep. Unfurled and flying, held by the front rider, was the king\u2019s banner bearing the royal crest.</p><p>Her haste was unseemly, but she didn\u2019t care. She picked up her skirts and ran for the courtyard. Ewan was already receiving word of the imminent arrival of the king\u2019s messenger. Word had raced like wildfire around the keep and her clansmen popped from every corner, crowding into the courtyard, the steps of the keep, and the hillside overlooking the courtyard.</p><p>The air of anticipation was thick and sparked like fire as the excited murmurs buzzed from person to person.</p><p>Mairin stood back, her bottom lip clenched so tightly between her teeth that she tasted blood. Ewan\u2019s brothers flanked Ewan as he waited the approaching riders.</p><p>The lead rider cantered across the bridge and pulled his horse up in front of Ewan. He slid off his mount and called a greeting.</p><p>\u201cI bear a message from His Majesty.\u201d</p><p>He handed a scroll to Ewan. Mairin surveyed the remaining riders. There were only a dozen armed soldiers, but there was no sign of trunks or anything that might signal the arrival of her dowry.</p><p>Ewan didn\u2019t immediately open the scroll. Instead he extended hospitality to the king\u2019s men. The rest dismounted and their horses were taken to the stables. The McCabe women brought refreshment to the men when they gathered in the hall to rest from their travel.</p><p>Ewan offered them lodging for the night, but they refused, their need to return to Carlisle castle pressing. Mairin died a thousand deaths as she hovered, waiting for Ewan to open the message. Only when the messenger was seated with drink and food did Ewan also sit and unroll the missive.</p><p>She whispered to Maddie to fetch quill and ink, knowing that Ewan would need to pen areply if one was necessary before the messenger took his leave.</p><p>As his eyes moved back and forth, his jaw clenched and his expression became murderous. Mairin\u2019s chest tightened in dread as she watched anger gather like a storm in his eyes.</p><p>Unable to restrain herself, she rushed forward and touched Ewan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cEwan? Is something amiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave me,\u201d he said harshly.</p><p>She instantly recoiled from the fury in his voice. Her hand dropped and she took a hasty step back. Ewan raised his gaze to the others assembled and barked an order to clear the hall.</p><p>Mairin turned and left, avoiding Maddie\u2019s look of sympathy when she passed her by.</p><p>Ewan read the missive again, unable to believe what was before his eyes. He scanned the signature at the bottom, noting that it was signed by the king\u2019s closest advisor, not the king himself. He wasn\u2019t sure what to make of that.</p><p>Regardless of whether it was signed by the king or his advisor, it bore the royal seal and was carried by a contingent of the king\u2019s royal guard. Ewan was compelled to obey, despite the fact that the accusations were laughable and an insult to his honor.</p><p>\u201cEwan, what has happened?\u201d Alaric demanded.</p><p>The king\u2019s messenger eyed Ewan warily as he shoved his goblet aside. \u201cWill you be penning a response, Laird?\u201d</p><p>Ewan\u2019s lip curled and he barely restrained his urge to wrap his hands around the man\u2019s neck. Only his knowledge that it was hardly fair to slay the messenger for the words of another kept him from venting his rage.</p><p>\u201cYou may bear my response back verbally. Tell our liege that I will come.\u201d</p><p>The messenger stood and, with a bow, signaled his men and beat a hasty retreat.</p><p>The hall was empty, save Ewan and his brothers. Ewan closed his eyes and brought his fist down on the table with a resounding crack.</p><p>\u201cEwan?\u201d Caelen\u2019s concern was sharp, as both he and Alaric leaned forward in their seats.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been summoned to court,\u201d Ewan began. He still couldn\u2019t believe the contents of the missive.</p><p>\u201cTo court? Why?\u201d Alaric demanded.</p><p>\u201cTo answer charges of abduction and rape. Duncan Cameron has taken his suit to the king and claimed that he married Mairin, consummated the marriage, and I abducted and abused her sorely. He put in a claim for Mairin\u2019s dowry that predated my own, and now he demands the return of his wife and the immediate release of her dowry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Both Caelen and Alaric roared their outrage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m to bringnsummated in to court, where the king will decide the matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Caelen asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure as hell not taking my wife anywhere Duncan Cameron is in residence. She\u2019ll remain here under strict guard while I travel to court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want us to do?\u201d Alaric asked tightly.</p><p>\u201cI need you to watch over Mairin. I trust you with her life. I\u2019ll take a contingent of my men with me but the bulk of my army will remain here. Mairin\u2019s safety is paramount. She\u2019s more vulnerable than ever now that she carries my child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Ewan, these charges are serious. If the king doesn\u2019t rule in your favor you\u2019ll face stiff sanctions. Possibly even a death sentence, since Mairin is the king\u2019s niece,\u201d Caelen said. \u201cYou need more support. If you leave the majority of your army here, it puts you at a disadvantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it would be best if you took Mairin with you,\u201d Alaric quietly suggested.</p> <p>\u201cAnd expose her to Cameron?\u201d Ewan snarled.</p><p>Caelen\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cWe would go with the might of the McCabe clan behind us. We may not be as large an army as Cameron\u2019s, but he\u2019s already suffered one crippling defeat against us, and he has to know, judging by the way he tucked tail and ran like the bastard coward he is, that he\u2019d commit suicide by challenging us to a fair fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis too convenient that you\u2019re summoned away, Ewan,\u201d Alaric added. \u201cIt divides our might. If you go with too little protection, you could be ambushed and killed on your way to court. If you take too much, it leaves the keep vulnerable and Mairin as well.\u201d</p><p>Ewan considered Alaric\u2019s words. As much as it pained him, after his initial vehemence over taking Mairin anywhere Duncan Cameron would be in attendance wore off, he knew that the best course was not to let Mairin out of his sight. If he went, so would she, and he\u2019d carry the might of the entire McCabe clan.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m too angry to think straight,\u201d Ewan said wearily. \u201cI will call on the McDonalds and the McLaurens to provide troops to protect the keep in our absence. Mairin needs to be close so I can see to her protection at all times. I don\u2019t like to think of her traveling now that she is with child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can take a slower pace and bring a litter so that she is comfortable,\u201d Caelen suggested.</p> <p>Ewan nodded, and then he remembered snarling at Mairin to leave him, when she\u2019d asked him what was amiss. He\u2019d been so furious that he\u2019d needed a moment to process the ludicrous charges that had been laid out against him.</p><p>\u201cJesu,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI must find Mairin and explain. I fair bit her head off before she left the hall, and now I must tell her that we have to travel to court to answer a summons from the king. Our future depends o the whim of our king. Her dowry. Neamh \u00c1lainn. My child. My wife. Everything could be taken away in a moment.\u201d</p><p>Alaric raised an eyebrow and exchanged glances with Caelen. \u201cAre you going to allow that?\u201d</p><p>Ewan pinned his brothers with the full intensity of the emotion brewing in his chest. \u201cNay. I\u2019ll send missives to the McLaurens, to the McDonalds, and to Laird Douglas to the north. I want them to be ready for war.\u201d</p><p>Mairin paced the floor of her chamber until she was ready to scream her frustration. What had the message from the king contained? Ewan had been furious. She\u2019d never seen him so angry, not even when Heath had struck her.</p><p>She was so sick with worry that for the first time in a fortnight, her stomach seized and nausea rose in her throat. She sank onto the stool in front of the fire and gripped the goblet of water that Maddie had brought up moments before. She sipped the liquid in an effort to settle her stomach, but the tension was knotted too thickly.</p><p>As soon as the water went down, her stomach lurched and she stumbled toward the chamber pot, retching the liquid right back up. She registered the door opening and closing, but she was too embroiled in her current misery.</p><p>\u201cAh, sweeting, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>Ewan\u2019s hands soothed up her back and her stomach convulsed painfully. He gathered her hair at her nape and put his palm over her belly in an effort to soothe her.</p><p>Sweat poured from her forehead and she sagged into Ewan\u2019s arms as she finally stopped the horrible gagging. He stroked her hair and held her tightly against him. He pressed a kiss to her temple, and she felt the roll of tension flash through his body.</p><p>She turned, so worried that for a moment she had to battle back the urge to heave again.</p><p>\u201cEwan, what is it?\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m so scared.\u201d</p><p>He palmed her face and stared down at her, his green eyes flashing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I yelled at you in the hall. I was greatly unsettled by the contents of the missive and I took out my anger\u2014and fright\u2014on you. It was unfair.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, unconcerned with his earlier outburst. It had been obvious that he had been upset over the news, whatever it was.</p><p>\u201cWhat was in the message?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>Ewan sighed and leaned forward until his forehead touched hers. \u201cFirst I want you to know that everything is going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>That statement only worried her all the more.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been summoned to court.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuncan Cameron launched a claim for your dowry before my request was received by the king.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. \u201cOn what grounds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more, Mairin,\u201d he said softly. \u201cHe claims you were married, that he bedded you, and that I stole you away and sorely abused you.\u201d</p><p>Mairin\u2019s eyes went wide with outrage. Her mouth opened and shut as she tried to gather an appropriate response.</p><p>\u201cWhen he learns you carry a child, he\u2019ll claim he fathered the babe.\u201d</p><p>Mairin clutched her belly, suddenly terrified as the implications hit her. Ewan had been summoned to answer to those charges. The king would decide the matter. What if he decided against Ewan?</p><p>The idea that she would be handed over to Duncan Cameron sent her straight back to the chamber pot. Ewan held her, murmuring words of love and reassurance as she was sick all over again.</p><p>When she was done, he scooped her in his arms and carried her to their bed. He gathered her close in his arms and cradled her against his chest as they lay on their sides.</p><p>She was terrified. Utterly terrified.</p><p>He tipped up her chin until their gazes were locked. \u201cI want you to listen to me, Mairin. No matter what happens, I will never hand you over to Duncan Cameron. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go against the king, Ewan,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThe hell I can\u2019t. No one takes my wife and child from me. I\u2019ll fight God himself, and be assured, Mairin, I won\u2019t lose.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around Ewan\u2019s waist and laid her head on his chest. \u201cLove me, Ewan. Hold me tight and love me.\u201d</p><p>He rolled until he was atop her, staring down into her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll always love you, Mairin. King and Duncan Cameron be damned. I\u2019ll never let you go.\u201d</p><p>He made sweet, fierce love to her, drawing out their pleasure until Mairin was senseless, until she knew nothing other than his love. Until she believed the words he\u2019d uttered so fiercely.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you go,\u201d he vowed as she fell apart in his arms. He found his own completion and cradled her to his chest, whispering his love for her and their child.</p><p>CHAPTER 33</p><p>\u201cI have bad news, Laird,\u201d Gannon said in a grim voice.</p><p>Not liking his commander\u2019s tone, Ewan looked up with a frown as Gannon strode toward him, still dusty from his travel.</p><p>\u201cDid you bring Father McElroy?\u201d Ewan demanded. Time was of the essence. Ewan had sent Gannon to fetch the priest so that he could bear witness to the wedding ceremony performed for Ewan airin. They only awaited the priest\u2019s arrival before they departed for court.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d Gannon bit out.</p><p>\u201cDead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurdered.\u201d</p><p>Blasphemies spewed from Ewan\u2019s lips. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days past. He was traveling between McLauren land and McGregor land to the south when he was set upon by thieves. They left him to rot and he was discovered by McGregor soldiers the next day.\u201d</p><p>Ewan closed his eyes. Thieves? Not likely. Priests had nothing to steal. A thief wouldn\u2019t have bothered. It was more likely that Cameron had arranged for the priest\u2019s murder to prevent his testimony before the king.</p><p>The one card that Ewan held was the fact that Mairin was David\u2019s niece, and surely he would listen to her accounting of the events. Women weren\u2019t heard in such matters, but Ewan couldn\u2019t imagine the king ignoring the word of his own blood.</p><p>\u201cReady our horses and the men,\u201d Ewan ordered his brothers. \u201cI\u2019ll go tell Mairin we\u2019re to leave posthaste.\u201d</p><p>Two hours later, with the arrival of McDonald and McLauren men to fortify the McCabe keep, Ewan and his men set off. Mairin rode in front of Ewan. A litter was carried at the end in case she wearied of the horse, but until such time came, Ewan wanted her as close to him as possible.</p><p>The clansmen gathered to see them off, worry marring each of their faces. The farewell was somber and tense, and prayers were whispered for the safe return of their laird and his lady.</p><p>They didn\u2019t travel as hard as Ewan might have in other circumstances. They stopped for the night before dusk fell and set up the tents and built several fires around the perimeter.</p><p>Ewan posted guards in turns around the area, as well as outside his and Mairin\u2019s tent. Mairin didn\u2019t sleep well, nor did she eat well. She was nervous and on edge, and the closer they got to Carlisle Castle, the deeper the shadows were under her eyes.</p><p>Ewan\u2019s men were just as tense and silent, as if they were mentally preparing for war. Ewan couldn\u2019t dispute that they might very well be going to war. Not just against Cameron, but against the crown.</p><p>Such an action would brand them as outlaws for the rest of their days. Life hadn\u2019t been easy for the McCabes these last eight years, but it would only get worse once there was a price on their heads.</p><p>On the fifth day of their journey, Ewan sent Diormid ahead to announce their impending arrival and also to find out if Cameron had already arrived and what the mood was at court.</p><p>They paused in their travel and Ewan coaxed Mairin to eat while they awaited Diormid\u2019s return.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to worry,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She raised her head until her gaze met his and her blue eyes shone with love. \u201cI have faith in you, Ewan.\u201d</p><p>Ewan turned when he heard a rider approaching. He left Mairin to greet Diormid who\u2019d returned from the castle.</p><p>His face was set into a grim line. \u201cI have instructions from the king\u2019s man. You\u2019re to leave your men outside the walls of the castle. You and Mairin are to be escorted inside at which point Mairin will be placed under the protection of the king until the situation has been resolved. You will have your own quarters until you are called to give testimony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Cameron?\u201d Ewan demanded.</p><p>\u201cAlso housed in separate quarters. Mairin is to be held in the king\u2019s private wing under heavy guard.\u201d</p><p>Ewan didn\u2019t even consider that dictate. \u201cShe does not leave me. She will take up residence in my quarters.\u201d He turned to his brothers and his three trusted commanders. \u201cYou will also accompany me inside the palace walls. There will be times when I must leave Mairin to attend our king, and I don\u2019t want her without protection for the barest of moments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, Laird. We\u2019ll guard her with our lives,\u201d Gannon vowed.</p><p>\u201cSee that you do.\u201d</p><p>They rode the hour\u2019s journey to the castle and when they neared, they were met by a small contingent of the king\u2019s soldiers and escorted to the castle walls.</p><p>On the east side of the walls, Cameron\u2019s men had taken up residence, their tents bearing Cameron\u2019s insignia and the banners flying from atop the structures. Ewan gestured for his men to camp on the western side and instructed them to remain alert at all times.</p><p>When his men departed, only Ewan and Mairin, Caelen and Alaric, and Ewan\u2019s three commanders that he had charged with Mairin\u2019s safety were left.</p><p>They rode down the long bridge over the moat and through the stone, arched gateway leading into the courtyard. Court was well attended at present and many stopped to watch as Ewan and his men came to a stop.</p><p>As the king\u2019s man-at-arms surveyed those in attendance with Ewan, he greeted Ewan with a frown. Ewan lowered Mairin down to Alaric and then swung from his saddle and pulled Mairin to his side.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m to escort the Lady Mairin to her private quarters,\u201d the man-at-arms said as he approached.</p><p>Ewan drew his sword and pointed it at the man, who stopped in his tracks. \u201cMy wife stays with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe king has not issued his judgment on the matter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt matters not. My wife will not leave my sight. Are we understood?\u201d</p><p>The soldier frowned. \u201cThe king will hear of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect he ll . You may also tell him that my lady wife is with child, and that she has journeyed a long way for this farce of a hearing. I am not pleased to have taken her from our home in a time she should be cared for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will of course bear your message to His Majesty,\u201d the soldier returned stiffly.</p> <p>He turned and motioned for several women who stood on the perimeter awaiting orders.</p><p>\u201cSee that Laird McCabe and his men are shown to their quarters and have refreshment after their travel.\u201d</p><p>Ewan aided Mairin up the winding steps to the section that housed chambers reserved for guests. Alaric, Caelen, and Ewan\u2019s commanders were directed to an open common room with an array of cots for sleeping. Ewan and Mairin were directed into a larger chamber at the corridor\u2019s end.</p><p>Ewan pulled her into his arms and eased her down onto the bed. \u201cRest, sweeting. We must be at our best during our sojourn here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will we do, Ewan?\u201d she asked against his neck. \u201cI have no wish to mingle at court. I have no finery in which to attend the dinners. I cannot pretend indifference when the very idea of sharing a meal at the same table as Duncan Cameron makes me ill.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe must act as if we are in the right. If we hide, people will say we have something to hide. If we avoid Duncan Cameron, people will say I fear him.\u201d</p><p>He stroked Mairin\u2019s cheek and gazed down into her eyes. \u201cWe must be on our guard and allow no one to think even for a moment that the claims Cameron launched are anything but false. If I can gain an audience with the king soon, I have faith that this will all be cleared up and we can be on our way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said quietly. She snuggled tighter into his embrace and yawned broadly. He kissed her brow and urged her to sleep. The travel had taken its toll along with her stress and unease. She would need her strength for what was to come.</p><p>A knock sounded at the chamber door, rousing Ewan from sleep. Mairin was still soundly asleep, her face tucked into his neck. Gently he pried himself away from her and rose, pulling on his tunic.</p><p>When he opened the door, a servant bowed and extended a jeweled plate with a scroll on top. Ewan took the scroll and nodded at the servant.</p><p>He carried the missive inside the chamber and sat at the small desk where a half-gone candle flickered, casting shadows on the wall. He unrolled the scroll and read the summons. He was to attend the evening meal at the king\u2019s table in the great hall.</p> <p>He glanced over at Mairin, who had succumbed to her exhaustion. He didn\u2019t want her to endure the strain of a meal where Cameron would likely be in attendance, but it was also important to maintain the public appearance of having done no wrong. Mairin was his wife. His beloved wife. She carried his child. The king and his advisors needed to see firsthand the absurdity of the charges against Ewan.</p><p>With a sigh he went to wake her. He had no jewels to adorn her with, but d sat eauty shone all the more brightly, undistracted by the glitter of riches. Her dress was a simple confection that the ladies had hastily sewn when they\u2019d learned of the impending journey to court.</p><p>A castle maid fashioned Mairin\u2019s hair, braiding and then coiling the heavy braid atop her head. The maid would have left off, but Mairin caught her hand. \u201c \u2019Tis unseemly for a married woman to show her hair at court, and I am married to Laird McCabe. Please fashion the wimple around my hair.\u201d</p><p>Ewan felt a surge of pride at how steady and composed his wife sounded even though he knew how afraid she was. When the maid was finished, Mairin stood and turned to her husband.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to escort me to dinner, Laird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, wife.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand, tucked it under his arm, and covered it with his other hand as he guided her from the chamber. His brothers waited just down the hall with Gannon, Cormac, and Diormid flanking them. They made an impressive sight, moving down the halls of the castle toward the great hall. Indeed, when they entered the hall, conversation quieted as everyone turned to see Ewan\u2019s entrance.</p><p>As Ewan escorted his wife toward the high table on the dais, murmurs rose and raced from table to table. Mairin went rigid against him and her chin jutted upward. Her eyes narrowed and a deep calm worked over her features. As on her wedding day when she\u2019d entered the hall with all the airs of a princess, she now walked beside Ewan as he guided her toward their seats.</p> <p>Another buzz of murmurs rose, this time louder, and Ewan turned to see Duncan Cameron striding toward them, wild relief on his face. Ewan tucked Mairin behind him and Ewan\u2019s brothers stepped forward, but Cameron stopped and dropped to his knees at Mairin\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cMy lady wife, finally. After so many months, I despaired of ever seeing you again.\u201d</p><p>Mairin stepped back, distancing herself from Cameron and clutching Ewan\u2019s hand even tighter. Ewan saw the speculation\u2014and the sympathy\u2014that Mairin\u2019s rejection inspired in the crowded hall. Cameron was playing the victim to the hilt, and he\u2019d obviously gained the support of many by humbling himself at Mairin\u2019s feet.</p><p>Cameron rose, grief engraved in the lines of his face. The man was a consummate actor; he even managed a gray pallor as he retreated, seemingly in defeat, to take his seat on the other side of the table.</p><p>Ewan had no sooner seated Mairin and himself when the trumpet sounded, signaling the king\u2019s arrival. Everyone stood and turned their attention to the door, but it wasn\u2019t King David who entered. It was a bevy of his closest advisors, including the king\u2019s cousin, Archibald, who\u2019d issued the summons for Ewan to appear.</p><p>Archibald nodded pompously and took the seat usually reserved for the king. He first eyed Duncan Cameron and then turned his gaze on Ewan before letting it slide to Mairin on Ewan\u2019s right.</p><p>\u201cI trust your journey was not too taxing, Lady Mairin. We have only just heard of your beig with child.\u201d</p><p>She bowed demurely. \u201cI thank you for your regard, my lord. My husband has taken great care with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is the king?\u201d Ewan asked bluntly.</p><p>Archibald had no liking for the question. His eyes narrowed as he stared at Ewan. \u201cThe king has other matters to attend to this night.\u201d</p><p>He turned to survey the many people seated at the tables in the hall. \u201cLet us eat,\u201d he announced.</p><p>The servants lining the wall burst into activity, filling goblets with wine and setting out the trenchers of food. The aroma was tantalizing and the tables overflowing with bounty.</p><p>\u201cEat,\u201d Ewan whispered to Mairin. \u201cYou must keep your strength up.\u201d</p><p>Ewan and Duncan\u2019s presence at the same table made the tension so thick that the rest of the noblemen seated around them remained silent. Archibald suffered no ill effects and ate grandly, gesturing for seconds and then thirds of the roasted chicken.</p><p>Ewan was ready to be done with the meal so that he and Mairin could retire to their bedchamber, but Archibald kept up a steady stream of mundane and tiresome chatter that made Ewan\u2019s head ache.</p><p>He had no patience for games played by courtiers. Everyone knew why he and his men were there, and the air was charged with anticipation over the potential confrontation. The people assembled were all but licking their chops over such an event.</p><p>\u201cThe king is considering the matter put before him,\u201d Archibald finally said, as he leaned back in his chair. \u201cHe intends to summon the both of you to present your side on the morrow. He understands that this is a stressful time for Lady Mairin and it isn\u2019t healthy for a woman in her delicate condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name is Lady McCabe,\u201d Ewan bit out.</p><p>Archibald raised his eyebrow. \u201cAye, well that does seem to be the pressing question. His Majesty will decide the matter on the morrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, if you would excuse me, my lord, I would take my lady wife back to our chamber so that she may rest.\u201d</p><p>Archibald waved his hand. \u201cBy all means. I know this must be an ordeal for her.\u201d</p><p>Ewan rose and then helped Mairin to her feet. Again she donned a cool, regal air that radiated from her in waves. She passed each table, head held high, until many of the people who stared at her averted their gaze in discomfort.</p><p>\u201cYou did well,\u201d Ewan murmured. \u201cThis will be done with tomorrow and we can return home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you are right, Ewan,\u201d she said anxiously, as he closed the door to their chamber. \u201cDuncan Cameron makes me uneasy. It isn\u2019t like him to adopt such a meek demeanor and play the snubbed. I do not like the king\u2019s man,\u201d she said bluntly. \u201cI will be d to put the matter before my uncle, the king. I have heard he is a fair man and a religious man, as was my father. Surely he will render a just judgment in accordance with God\u2019s will.\u201d</p><p>Ewan had less faith in the piety of men and their willingness to act in accordance to God\u2019s laws, but he didn\u2019t say as much to Mairin. He wanted her to have faith that it would end quickly and in their favor. But already Ewan was silently preparing for the worst.</p><p>The next morning, Ewan was up before dawn. He paced the floor of the chamber, waiting and worrying. He\u2019d spoken to his brothers after Mairin had fallen asleep the night before and they had planned for every contingency.</p><p>A knock sounded at the door and Ewan went quickly to answer so Mairin wouldn\u2019t be awakened.</p><p>One of the king\u2019s guards stood outside the door. \u201cHis Majesty requests the presence of the Lady Mairin in his quarters. He will send a guard for her in an hour\u2019s time. You are to await his command to appear in the great hall.\u201d</p><p>Ewan frowned.</p><p>\u201cShe will be well cared for, Laird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will hold you personally accountable for her safety,\u201d Ewan said menacingly.</p><p>The guard nodded and then departed down the hall. \u201cEwan?\u201d</p><p>Ewan turned to see Mairin up on her elbow, her hair streaming over the shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat is happening?\u201d</p><p>Ewan crossed the room and sat on the edge of the bed. Unable to resist, he ran his hand along her side and then to the tiny swell of her belly.</p><p>\u201cHave you been able to tell if our child moves yet?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and cupped her hand over his. \u201c \u2019Tis just a flutter, almost like a tiny brush over my skin. But aye, I can feel him.\u201d</p><p>Ewan pushed up her nightdress until the smooth expanse of skin was bared to his sight. He leaned down and pressed his mouth to the curve of her belly. The swell was firm, the evidence of the child she sheltered within her body. Ewan was sure he\u2019d never seen a more beautiful sight. He was captivated and wholly entranced. He could spend hours enjoying the silky smooth pale skin and the beauty of the woman who carried his child.</p><p>Mairin\u2019s fingers tangled in Ewan\u2019s long hair as he kissed the shallow indention of her navel.</p><p>\u201cWhat did the messenger say?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>Ewan raised his head and stared into her eyes. \u201cHe summoned you to the king\u2019s chamber in an hour\u2019s time. He\u2019s sending a guard to escort you and then he will summon me to the great hall.\u201d</p><p>Nervousness fluttered in her eyes and her lips tightened into a thin line. She tensed beneath the hand he held cupped over her belly and he began stroking her to alleviate some ble to e tension.</p><p>\u201cI do not feel he will allow any harm to come to you, sweeting. You are his niece, his blood. For him not to ensure your safety reflects badly on him. His rule is too tenuous with the threat of Malcolm and Malcolm\u2019s followers for him to do anything to lose support.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward and cupped his face, her thumbs running over his cheekbones. \u201cYou always know just what to say. I love you for that, my mighty warrior.\u201d</p><p>He turned until his mouth slid over her palm and he pressed a kiss to the tender skin. \u201cAnd I love you. Remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummon the maid. I will need help if I am to be ready to see the king in an hour\u2019s time,\u201d she said with a grimace.</p><p>He rose and helped her from the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll summon her at once.\u201d</p><p>She stood at his side and turned her face up so that she looked deep into his eyes. \u201cPromise me that we will leave the moment this matter is settled. I\u2019ve a need to be home with my clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have my word.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 34</p><p>Mairin walked down the hall, surrounded by four guards. She was more nervous by the minute at the idea of coming face-to-face with her uncle. She was prepared to plead Ewan\u2019s case and tell him all that Duncan had done. After hearing all she had to say, the king couldn\u2019t possibly rule in Duncan\u2019s favor.</p><p>The guard knocked and the door was opened by Archibald, who motioned them inward. He smiled and took Mairin\u2019s hand and guided her to a comfortable chair in the lavishly decorated sitting room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid the king is not himself today,\u201d he said smoothly. \u201cHe\u2019s been forced to retire and conveys his deepest regrets that he is unable to speak with you privately as he\u2019d hoped. I will act on his behalf and render judgment on the matter before the crown.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alarm beat in Mairin\u2019s chest as she settled more comfortably in the chair. Her hands shook and she hid them in the folds of her skirts so as not to betray her unease.</p><p>\u201cI do hope His Majesty\u2019s ailment is not serious,\u201d she said politely. \u201cI had looked forward to making the acquaintance of my only blood relative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not entirely accurate,\u201d Archibald said. \u201cI am the king\u2019s cousin, so that makes us related by blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, of course,\u201d she murmured.</p> <p>\u201cI would ask that you wait here, cousin, until you are summoned to the great hall. I will, of course, provide refreshment. You\u2019ll want for nothing during your confinement.\u201d</p><p>cousin, and then his casual reference to confinement, made the hairs on Mairin\u2019s nape prickle. Still, he viewed her kindly and seemed genuinely concerned over her well-being, so she smiled and offered her thanks.</p><p>\u201cI would speak to you, if permissible, about the matter before you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>He patted her arm. \u201c \u2019Tis not necessary, dear lady. I am sure the experience has been trying enough and \u2019tis my duty to get to the bottom of it by hearing both men\u2019s accounts. I assure you, I will have the right of it.\u201d</p><p>She had to force herself not to argue. The last thing she wanted was to anger the man who held her life in his hands.</p> <p>\u201cNow, if you will excuse me, I must make my way to the great hall and summon the lairds to bear testimony. I will, of course, call for you when they are ready.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and clenched her hands together in her lap. As the king\u2019s cousin left the room, she offered a fervent prayer that justice would prevail this day and that Duncan Cameron would be consigned to hell where he belonged.</p><p>Ewan stood outside the great hall with his brothers and commanders and awaited his summons. Down aways stood Duncan Cameron with his men, and it took all Ewan had to not launch himself at the man and kill him on the spot.</p><p>Cameron was summoned first, and he walked by Ewan with a look of smug satisfaction. It wasn\u2019t just the snideness that bothered Ewan. It was the supreme confidence in both look and manner. Cameron was a man who feared not the outcome of today\u2019s hearing.</p><p>Caelen put his hand on Ewan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNo matter what happens, we\u2019re with you, Ewan.\u201d</p><p>Ewan nodded his appreciation, then he murmured in a low voice that only his brothers could hear. \u201cIf things go badly, I want you to leave the hearing, find Mairin, and take her from the castle. Her safety is the most important thing. Whatever you have to do to secure her, do it.\u201d</p> <p>Alaric nodded his understanding.</p><p>Next, Ewan was called to make his appearance and he walked into the hall, his brothers shoulder to shoulder behind him. He knew his warriors made an impressive sight. They were larger, more muscled, more fierce looking than any other warriors in attendance.</p><p>They stalked down the cleared path in the middle of the hall to the dais where Archibald sat in David\u2019s throne. The hall was packed full of people, all insatiably curious as to how the king would rule.</p><p>Excited murmurs greeted Ewan\u2019s entrance, and his brothers and commanders got many a scrutinizing look from the other soldiers present.</p><p>At the front of the assembled people, Ewan stood on the left side of the hall and Cameron stood on the right as they awaited David\u2019s arrival.</p><p>Instead of the king\u2019s arrival, soldiers filled the room, lining the pathway to the dais so that everyone was contained behind the line of warriors. More soldiers filled the front of theight=\"0eom, surrounding the dais and standing in a firm line in front of Archibald.</p><p>Ewan frowned. It was as if they expected a battle.</p><p>And then his wife entered the hall, flanked by David\u2019s soldiers. She slowly made her way up the aisle toward the dais where Archibald watched her approach. He gestured for her to take the position on his right and she gracefully sank into the seat. Her gaze instantly found Ewan\u2019s, and no one in the room could discount the instant flash of emotion that arced like a bolt of lightning between them.</p> <p>Archibald held his hands up and addressed the assembled crowd. \u201cHis Majesty, King David, is indisposed this day. He is ill and our prayers should be with our king in his time of need. He has asked that I preside over today\u2019s hearing and that my word be received as his.\u201d</p><p>Ewan turned sharply to his brothers to see the same incredulity etched on their faces as was on his. This was wrong. It was all wrong. Ewan curled his fingers into fists and glanced over at Duncan, who only had eyes for Mairin.</p><p>\u201cLaird Cameron, you\u2019ve leveled serious charges against Laird McCabe. Come forward. I would hear all from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>Duncan walked confidently toward the dais and bowed low before Lord Archibald.</p><p>\u201cMairin Stuart arrived at Cameron Keep from Kilkirken Abby, where we were married by the priest who has tended to the souls of my clan for two score years. I have a letter written from him to the king attesting to this fact.\u201d</p><p>Ewan\u2019s eyes narrowed in outrage that a man of God would be a willing party to this deception. Duncan handed over the scroll to Archibald, who unrolled and read it before setting it aside.</p><p>\u201cOur marriage was consummated.\u201d Duncan pulled from the pouch that hung at his side the sheet bearing Mairin\u2019s bloodstain. \u201cI offer this as proof.\u201d</p><p>Ewan\u2019s fists clenched in rage. Aye, the blood was Mairin\u2019s blood. It was the sheet that Ewan had ordered Cameron\u2019s man to bear back to his laird, the proof that Ewan and Mairin\u2019s marriage had been consummated. The sheet that Duncan now offered as proof of his bedding of Mairin.</p><p>Archibald turned to Mairin, whose face was as pale as death, her gaze fastened on the sheet. She looked up at Ewan in bewilderment, and Ewan closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cCan you attest to the fact that the blood on the sheet is yours, Lady Mairin? Do you recognize the linen?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks colored and she looked at Lord Archibald, clearly unsure as to how to proceed.</p><p>\u201cI would have your answer,\u201d Archibald prompted.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d she said, her voice cracking. \u201c \u2019Tis my blood, but \u2019tis not Duncan Cameron\u2019s sheet. \u2019Tis from the bed of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is all I require,\u201d Archibald said, slicing his hand in the air to silence Mairin.heet that 1C;I require an answer, nothing more. Be silent until I\u2019ve given you permission to speak again.\u201d</p><p>Fury settled in Ewan\u2019s chest, boiling, at the manner in which Archibald addressed Mairin. He showed her blatant disrespect as both the wife of a laird and cousin to the king.</p><p>She looked as though she\u2019d argue, but Ewan caught her gaze and quickly shook his head. He had no desire for her to be punished for speaking out in the king\u2019s court. The punishment for such was steep, and more so for a woman daring to speak out.</p><p>She bit her lip and looked away, but not before Ewan saw the rage in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened next?\u201d Archibald asked Cameron.</p><p>\u201cMere days after my marriage to Lady Mairin, she was abducted from my keep by men acting under Laird McCabe\u2019s orders. She was taken from me to where she has remained, on McCabe lands. The child she carries is mine. Laird McCabe has no claim. Our marriage is valid. He has kept her prisoner and forced her to his will. I ask for his majesty\u2019s intervention so that my lady wife and my child are returned to me and her dowry is released to me as requested in my missive to the king informing him of our marriage months past.\u201d</p><p>Mairin gasped at the accusations that spilled from Duncan\u2019s lips. Ewan started forward, but Caelen gripped his arm and held him back.</p><p>\u201cCousin, please,\u201d Mairin pleaded. \u201cLet me be heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence!\u201d Archibald roared. \u201cIf you cannot hold your tongue, woman, I will have you removed from this hall.\u201d</p><p>He turned back to Duncan. \u201cHave you witnesses who support your accounting of what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have the statement from the priest who wed us. That predates any claim Laird McCabe makes on Mairin, her dowry, or her lands.\u201d</p><p>Archibald nodded and then turned his cool stare to Ewan. \u201cWhat say you to these claims, Laird McCabe?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis complete and utter horseshit,\u201d Ewan said calmly.</p><p>Archibald\u2019s brows drew together and his cheeks reddened. \u201cYou will hold a civil tongue in your head, Laird. You would not speak thusly to the king, and you will not speak in my presence as such.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can only speak the truth, my lord. Laird Cameron speaks falsely. He stole Mairin Stuart from the abbey where she\u2019d taken refuge for the last ten years. When she refused to wed him, he beat her so badly that she could barely walk for days afterward, and she wore the bruises for an entire fortnight.\u201d</p><p>The hall broke into a series of murmurs. The buzz rose and grew louder until Archibald shouted for order.</p><p>\u201cWhat proof do you offer?\u201d Archibald asked.</p><p>\u201cI saw the bruises. I saw the fear in her eyes when she arrived on my lands, that I would trea her as she was treated by Cameron. My brother Alaric tended her for the three-day journey from where he found her after she escaped Cameron\u2019s clutches until they arrived on McCabe land. He, too, saw the bruises and witnessed the pain that the lass endured.</p><p>\u201cWe were married a few days after her arrival. She came to my bed pure and her virgin\u2019s blood was spilled on my sheet, the one that Cameron has offered to you this day. The child she carries is mine. She has known no other man.\u201d</p><p>Archibald leaned back in his seat, his fingers pressing together in a V as he surveyed the two men in front of him. \u201cYou give a very different accounting than Laird Cameron. Have you witnesses who can speak as to the veracity of your words?\u201d</p><p>Ewan\u2019s teeth snapped together in a snarl. \u201cI have given you the right of it. I need no witness to verify my claim. If you want to ask someone, ask my wife. She will tell you exactly what I have told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would speak, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Ewan turned, surprised to see Diormid step forward, his gaze focused on Lord Archibald.</p><p>\u201cAnd who are you?\u201d Archibald demanded.</p><p>\u201cI am Diormid. I have commanded under Laird McCabe five years past. I am among his most trusted men, and I myself was charged with the safety of Lady Mairin on many occasions after her arrival on McCabe land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, approach and give your accounting.\u201d</p><p>Ewan glanced back at Gannon, who shook his head at Ewan\u2019s silent question. Diormid stepping forward wasn\u2019t at Gannon\u2019s instigation. Ewan had instructed them to say or do nothing during the hearing.</p><p>\u201cI have no knowledge of what transpired before the lady Mairin arrived on McCabe land. I can only speak as to the events that transpired afterward. \u2019Tis the truth that she was sorely mistreated under Laird McCabe\u2019s hand. He guarded her jealously and, \u2019tis the truth, she was most unhappy during her time at McCabe Keep. I witnessed her tears on more than one occasion.\u201d</p><p>A gasp went up from the crowd. Ewan saw a haze of red that buzzed in his ears and clouded his eyes. Bloodlust hit him so hard. He\u2019d never wanted to kill another man as much as he wanted to kill Diormid at that moment.</p><p>Ewan\u2019s brothers were equally furious. Gannon and Cormac looked horrified by Diormid\u2019s calm recitation of blatant lies.</p><p>\u201cDuring the time she was on McCabe land, she was shot at by an archer and poisoned. She nearly died. It should also be noted that the priest who was called to marry the laird and Lady Mairin died under suspicious circumstances less than a fortnight ago.\u201d</p><p>Ewan could stand no more. His roar shook the entire room as he lunged for Diormid. Mairin screamed his name. His brothers dove after him. Chaos reigned as the king\u2019s soldiers leaped in to separate the two men. It took seven of the guards to pry Ewan away from Diormid.</p><p>\u201cHow could you betray us this way?\u201d Ewan demanded as he was hauled back from Diormid. \u201cHow could you stand before God and king and give false witness to events you know to be untrue? May God consign you to hell for this sin. You have betrayed me. You have betrayed Lady McCabe. You have betrayed your clan. And for what? A bit of coin from Duncan Cameron?\u201d</p><p>Diormid refused to meet Ewan\u2019s gaze. He wiped the blood from his mouth where Ewan had struck him and turned to face Archibald. \u201c \u2019Tis as I have said, as God is my witness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lie!\u201d Ewan roared.</p><p>Duncan Cameron moved to stand by Mairin\u2019s side. Her eyes were haunted and fixed on Diormid. Her hand covered her mouth that was agape with shock.</p><p>\u201cThis is disturbing,\u201d Archibald declared. \u201cYou will restrain yourself, Laird McCabe, or I\u2019ll have you taken to the dungeon.\u201d</p><p>When Duncan put his hand on Mairin\u2019s shoulder, Ewan erupted again. \u201cDon\u2019t you touch her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would protect my wife from Laird McCabe\u2019s outburst,\u201d Duncan said to Archibald. \u201cAllow me to take her away from this.\u201d</p><p>Archibald held up his hand. \u201cI believe I\u2019ve heard enough to render judgment in this matter. I rule in Laird Cameron\u2019s favor. He is free to take his wife and return to his lands. The dowry entrusted to the crown until Mairin Stuart weds will be released to Laird Cameron and taken to his lands under palace guard.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A cry rippled across the room as Mairin shot to her feet. \u201cNay!\u201d</p><p>Ewan was in a state of shock. A man he\u2019d trusted with his very life, with Mairin\u2019s life, had betrayed them all in the cruelest fashion possible. It was also apparent that Ewan had never had a chance from the start. Archibald was in league with Duncan Cameron. What wasn\u2019t clear was whether the king was also in league with Cameron, or whether Archibald boldly plotted against his cousin.</p><p>\u201cMy lord, please hear me,\u201d Mairin pleaded. \u201c \u2019Tis not true. None of it is true! My husband is Laird McCabe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence, woman!\u201d Duncan roared. He backhanded her in reprimand and she fell into the chair she\u2019d just risen from.</p> <p>\u201cShe is distraught and clearly not thinking straight, my lord. Please forgive her impertinence. I will deal with her later.\u201d</p><p>Ewan could not be contained. As soon as Cameron struck Mairin, Ewan went crazy. He exploded across the room, hitting Duncan in the chest. The two men went down as, once again, chaos reigned.</p><p>This time his brothers did nothing to stop him. They were fighting their own battle against the king\u2019s guard. A battle they couldn\u2019t hope to win. They were hugely outnumbered, more than a dozen to one. Without their swords, they were at an even greater disadvantage.</p><p>Ewan was hauled off Duncan and went to the floor under the weht of four soldiers. They pulled his arms back and pressed his face to the floor. Mairin flew to his side and knelt down, her hands reaching for him. Tears slid freely down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cImprison Laird McCabe!\u201d Archibald ordered. \u201cAnd his men. Laird Cameron, take your wife and be gone from this hall.\u201d</p> <p>Duncan bent over and grabbed Mairin by the hair as he hauled her upward. She fought like a wildcat and Ewan roared his fury as he broke free and tried to attack Duncan again.</p><p>The soldiers grabbed him, holding him back even as he bucked and strained against them.</p><p>Mairin was being pulled away, her eyes filled with tears, her arms outstretched to Ewan.</p><p>\u201cMairin!\u201d Ewan called hoarsely. \u201cListen to me. Survive. You survive! Endure. No matter what. Endure what you must but survive for me. Survive for our child. I will come for you. I swear it on my life. I will come for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said brokenly. \u201cI will always love you.\u201d</p><p>The hilt of a sword crashed down on his head. The pain blurred his vision and his head snapped to the side. As he slid toward the floor, blackness closing in around him, his last image was of Mairin being dragged, screaming, from the hall by Duncan Cameron.</p> <p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>CHAPTER 35</p><p>Mairin found herself thrust into Duncan Cameron\u2019s chamber ahead of him. He barked orders to those around him as she stumbled toward the bed. When he neared the bed where she was sprawled, she hastily backed away, prepared to fend him off in whatever way necessary.</p><p>He sat on the edge of the bed, his expression calm as he surveyed her. One of the servants pressed a goblet into his hand and then Duncan waved them away. One by one, his men exited the chamber until he was alone with Mairin.</p><p>She edged up onto her elbow and inched backward to put more space between them.</p><p>He gave an exaggerated sigh of resignation. \u201cI regret what transpired between us the first time we met. I realize my actions were reprehensible and my wooing skills are sorely lacking.\u201d</p><p>Wooing skills? Reprehensible? His words swam through her muddled mind. Was he insane?</p><p>\u201cYour actions now are reprehensible,\u201d she said hoarsely. \u201cYou lied. One of Ewan\u2019s own men lied and betrayed our clan. I can only assume at your instigation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt would benefit you to make the best of your situation,\u201d Duncan said, his voice carrying a hint of dark warning.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said, her voice breaking. She hated that she was reduced to begging before this man. But for Ewan, sh had no pride. There was nothing she wouldn\u2019t do. \u201cLet me return to Ewan. I am married to him truly.\u201d</p><p>Duncan shrugged. \u201cIt matters not whether you are married to him or me. That is of little consequence as long as I receive your dowry and control of Neamh \u00c1lainn.\u201d He transferred the goblet to the hand closest to Mairin and extended it in her direction. \u201cNow here, drink this, dearling. \u2019Twill solve our immediate problem. I regret that it will cause you pain, but hopefully it won\u2019t last overlong.\u201d</p><p>She stared at the cup hovering close to her lips. She sniffed and recoiled from the bitter smell.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? Why will it cause me pain?\u201d Did he think her daft?</p><p>He gave her a gentle smile that sent a cold shiver down her spine. \u201c \u2019Tis necessary to rid your body of the babe you carry. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll give you sufficient time to heal before I make demands. I don\u2019t want to wait overlong, though. \u2019Tis important that you carry my child as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>Terror hit her in the stomach. Nausea rose, billowed up into her chest until she gagged and had to turn away. She buried her face in the pillow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she muffled out. \u201c \u2019Twas not well done of me but I find myself ill at the oddest times ever since learning of the babe I carry.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis the way of things,\u201d Duncan offered generously. \u201cWhen you carry my child, you\u2019ll not lift a finger. You\u2019ll be waited on hand and foot.\u201d</p><p>Until you deliver. The words weren\u2019t spoken but they hovered heavy in the air. Aye, she had no doubt she\u2019d be treated like a queen until the day she bore the heir to Neamh \u00c1lainn.</p><p>He meant to kill her child. Ewan\u2019s child. And replace it with his own seed. The mere thought had her gagging again, and she inhaled sharply through her nose to prevent vomiting all over the bed.</p><p>\u201cHere, \u2019tis better to have it done with. Drink it down. I\u2019ll summon the palace healer to help you through the worst of it. \u2019Tis said it can be very painful.\u201d</p><p>He was so calm about it. How could he discuss murder with a tender smile? The man was a monster. A demon from hell.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you waste valuable time?\u201d she choked out. She tried frantically to come up with a plan, something, anything to sway him from murder.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat mean you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seek to rid my womb of the child I carry when I am already nearly half done with the carrying. Losing a babe at this advanced stage can render a woman barren. \u2019Tis no guarantee I\u2019ll become pregnant right away or at all. You\u2019ve already claimed to all that the babe I carry is yours. If it matters not who I\u2019m married to, why should it matter whose babe I carry? As long as I deliver a child, control of Neamh \u00c1lainn is yours. Why would you wait and risk my not becomg pregnant again?\u201d</p><p>His frown deepened, as if he hadn\u2019t considered such a possibility.</p><p>\u201cI want my child to live,\u201d she said softly. \u201cRegardless of who it calls father. I\u2019d do anything to protect him. In that regard you have the advantage, Laird.\u201d</p><p>Duncan stood and paced restlessly in front of the bed. He stopped every once in awhile and eyed her as if trying to determine the truth of her words.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis often said a mother\u2019s love knows no bounds. All right, Mairin Stuart. I agree to your terms. I\u2019ll spare your child\u2019s life, but from this day on you are mine. You\u2019ll not fight me when I seek to avail myself of your body. You will never utter a single word to contradict the account I have given Lord Archibald. Are we understood?\u201d</p><p>May God forgive me.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d she choked out.</p><p>\u201cThen be prepared to depart the castle. We leave in an hour\u2019s time to return to Cameron land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEwan! Ewan! Wake up for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>Ewan found himself shaken roughly as he gained awareness of his surroundings. He cracked an eye open and glanced around only to find himself cloaked in darkness.</p><p>\u201cCaelen?\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>The relief in Caelen\u2019s voice was staggering.</p><p>\u201cMairin.\u201d</p><p>The single word sent grief splintering through his head and chest. Bile rose in his throat at the knowledge that right now his wife was with her tormentor.</p><p>\u201cMairin,\u201d he said again. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>The silence was oppressive. He heard his brothers\u2019 breathing in the darkness, knew they dreaded the telling they must do.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ewan. Duncan departed hours past, bearing Mairin with him,\u201d Alaric said in a grim voice.</p><p>Ewan sat up, pain ripping through his head. His brothers caught his shoulders and guided him back down again when he nearly fell.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe king\u2019s dungeon,\u201d Caelen said, fury laced in each word. \u201cThe little bastard Archibald had us all tossed in here after his soldiers bashed you in the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCormac and Gannon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, Laird,\u201d Gannon returned.</p><p>Ice filled Ewan\u2019s veins as everything came back to him in a rush. \u201cDiormid. Where is he now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain, Laird, but he\u2019ll have gone from here. He knows any of us will kill him on sight. \u2019Tis possible he went with Cameron, since it looks that he was working with Cameron all along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe attempts on my life. The arrow. The poison. It must have been him. He had orders from Cameron to kill me. When that didn\u2019t work, he put his petition before the king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect he had the petition working even before Diormid\u2019s attempts on your life,\u201d Alaric said. \u201cHe had every angle covered from the start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe question is, if David is involved in this along with Archibald or if Archibald acts alone with Cameron,\u201d Caelen mused.</p><p>Ewan put his hands on the rough floor of the dungeon and pushed himself into a sitting position. \u201cArchibald said that David was indisposed and castle rumor confirmed that the king is very ill. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Archibald is behind that as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Ewan?\u201d Alaric asked. \u201cDoes your head pain you overmuch?\u201d</p><p>Ewan touched the side of his head, felt the warmth of blood, but it was thick and it no longer flowed freely. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. What\u2019s important is that Mairin not stay in Cameron\u2019s grasp a minute longer than she has to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve sent a message to our men,\u201d Caelen said. \u201c \u2019Tis my hope we hear from them soon.\u201d</p><p>Ewan stared around the darkened dungeon. \u201cHow did you send a message to our men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have threatened one of the guards who tossed us into the cell,\u201d Caelen admitted. \u201cI told him that unless he informed our men of our fate that I would spit him on my sword, castrate him, and feed his cods to the buzzards.\u201d</p><p>Alaric chuckled. \u201cThe man couldn\u2019t leave us fast enough to bear Caelen\u2019s message to our men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have we been down here?\u201d Ewan asked as he rubbed more of the blood from the side of his head.</p><p>Caelen sighed. \u201cSeveral hours. One of the guards who obviously feels \u2019tis best to remain on my good side informed me of Cameron\u2019s departure a few hours past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Ewan swore. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that bastard allowed Mairin to fall into Cameron\u2019s hands. This was all a setup from the beginning. Archibald never had any intention of presenting this matter before David, and he damn sure never had any intention of listening to Mairin or to me. Diormid\u2019s testimony just gave him the sway of public opinion so that when he rendered his judgment, there was no backlash from the other lairds who might have thought he intervened unfairly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Laird,\u201d Cormac said, devastation in every word. \u201cI should have seen it. I spent every day in Diormid\u2019s company. I fought with him. Ate with him. We trained together. We were as brothers. I would have never dreamed he would betray us.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis just as much my fault as anyone\u2019s,\u201d Ewan said bleakly. \u201cI trusted him with Mairin\u2019s safety many times.\u201d</p><p>Ewan rubbed his hand tiredly over his face and tried to put the memory of Cameron\u2019s hands on Mairin out of his mind. He couldn\u2019t imagine Cameron hurting Mairin because it would drive him insane. The only way to survive this was to turn it off. Turn off his emotions. Turn off the images flashing through his mind with torturous precision.</p><p>\u201cCameron will expect a full-scale attack on his holding,\u201d Caelen pointed out. \u201cHe\u2019ll know that Archibald cannot hold us in the king\u2019s dungeon forever, and he knows you\u2019ll come for Mairin. He\u2019ll know it and expect it, so he\u2019ll be prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t risk Mairin\u2019s safety by attacking his keep with the might of my entire army. If she was not in residence, I\u2019d give him the fight he expects and not give a damn that he expects it. I\u2019d swarm over his lands like the plague and decimate everything in our path. But I won\u2019t take the risk that Mairin would be caught up in the battle. And if Duncan knew all was lost, he\u2019d kill her out of spite.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAye,\u201d Alaric agreed. \u201cWhat then do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe steal into his keep and take Mairin back.\u201d</p><p>Caelen let out a deep breath, the sound loud in the quiet of the dungeon cell. \u201cYou make it sound like a simple raiding mission, Ewan. Cameron will expect such a trick as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll succeed. We have no other option.\u201d</p> <p>Caelen, Alaric, Gannon, and Cormac voiced their agreement. Silence fell once again as they waited.</p><p>An hour later, a sound outside the cell stirred them to action. Caelen leaped to his feet and charged toward the iron bars as a guard shuffled down the corridor, torch in hand.</p><p>\u201cYou must hurry,\u201d the guard whispered in an urgent voice. \u201cYour men have staged a distraction. Follow me. I\u2019ll show you to the northern gate.\u201d</p><p>Alaric helped Ewan to his feet and they hurried from the cell and up the stone staircase to the first level of the castle. The guard rushed down the long corridor, past the great hall, and beyond to the kitchens.</p><p>They exited the castle through the small door where rubbish was discarded and approached a small wooden gate carved into the imposing stone wall that jutted upward. The guard produced a key and hastily unlocked the large metal padlock.</p> <p>\u201cGo,\u201d he urged.</p><p>Ewan\u2019s men filed out of the doorway and Ewan paused at the end. \u201cYou have my thanks,\u201d he told the guard. \u201cYou need to watch over your king. Archibald plots against him. I\u2019ve heard rumor the king is unwell. Examine his food and drink.\u201d</p><p>The guard nodded. \u201cGo with God, Laird McCabe. I\u2019ll pray for the safe return of your lady wife.\u201d</p><p>Ewan ducked out of the doorway and followed his men into the night. They raced across the terrain, heading for the distant cover of the forest.</p><p>CHAPTER 36</p><p>Ewan trilled a soft birdcall, the sound echoing over the still night. In the distance, an answering call sounded and Ewan crept stealthily forward, his brothers on his heels.</p> <p>They\u2019d waited four days for the new moon, after taking three days to arrive on Cameron land and carefully survey the layout of the keep. Ewan couldn\u2019t wait a single moment longer. There had been no sign of Mairin in several long days as they watched and waited. Duncan was keeping her under tight wraps.</p><p>After singling out the chamber that Mairin was most likely housed in, Ewan and his men circled the keep. Along with his brothers, Ewan crept inside the stone skirt, past the sleeping guards to the tower that loomed overhead.</p><p>Now in the darkness, Ewan tossed the rope with the hook up the wall. It took five attempts before he hooked the sill. Tugging on the rope to make sure it would hold, he began a quick hand-over-hand scale up the wall to the window.</p><p>Mairin stood in her window and bowed her head, as the shame of her circumstances fell over her shoulders.</p><p>A devil\u2019s bargain. Her child\u2019s life for her own. Her child\u2019s life for her life with Ewan. She didn\u2019t regret the decision she\u2019d made, but she mourned all she had lost. All she\u2019d never have.</p><p>The strain of the last week was too much to bear. She was at her wit\u2019s end. She was afraid to eat lest Duncan change his mind and go back on his word. She feared at every turn that he\u2019d put a potion into her drink or food that would cause her to lose her child.</p><p>She lived in constant fear of having to give herself to the man who now called her wife. She swayed wearily and turned in the direction of the bed. She couldn\u2019t continue on in this manner. It wasn\u2019t good for her child, and yet she had no choice.</p><p>Tears glistened on her cheeks as she gave in to the overwhelming grief welling from the depths of her soul. How could she live when she\u2019d known a love so deep that she ached at the memory? How could she ever willingly lie with a man after knowing Ewan\u2019s touch?</p> <p>Finally, in her exhaustion, she crawled under the covers and buried her head in the pillow so no one would hear her sobs.</p><p>She had no idea of the passing of time. When she felt a hand slide over her arm and to her shoulder, she flinched away and turned over, prepared to defend herself from Duncan\u2019s attack.</p><p>\u201cShh, lass, \u2019tis me, Ewan,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She ared up at her husband in the darkness, unable to believe that he was here, in her chamber.</p><p>He touched her wet cheek and wiped away the trail of tears. His voice was tortured and the words seemed ripped from his very soul. \u201cAh, Mairin, what did he do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEwan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, lass, \u2019tis me.\u201d</p><p>She rose up and threw her arms around his neck, holding on for dear life. If she was dreaming, she never wanted to wake up. She wanted to exist in this dream world where Ewan\u2019s arms were securely around her and she could smell his strong masculine scent.</p><p>He crushed her to him, his hand stroking her head, shaking and making a mess of her already unruly hair.</p><p>\u201cEwan,\u201d she choked out. \u201cOh God, Ewan. Ewan.\u201d</p><p>His lips found hers and he kissed her desperately, as if it were the last kiss they\u2019d ever share. Their lips tangled and her tears slipped onto their tongues. She breathed him in, the last breath she wanted to take. She lived in this moment, reaching for everything she\u2019d lost, for everything she wanted most.</p><p>\u201cShh, don\u2019t cry, lass. You\u2019re breaking my heart. We don\u2019t have much time. I\u2019ve got to take you from this place.\u201d</p><p>His words penetrated the heavy grief surrounding her. She stared up at him, afraid to believe he was real, that he was there and not a figment of her dearest fantasies.</p><p>He picked her up from the bed and carried her toward the window. He leaned out and she clutched at his shoulders as she stared down at the dizzying distance between her sill and the ground.</p><p>\u201cListen to me, sweeting,\u201d he said in a gentle voice. He brushed his lips over her temple and held her tightly against his chest. \u201cWe\u2019re going down a rope from your window.\u201d</p><p>She raised her head in alarm. \u201cEwan, I can\u2019t! The babe. I\u2019m too big and clumsy.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her chin and stroked his fingers over her cheek as he stared down at her. \u201cI\u2019ll be with you every step of the way. I\u2019m going to lower you down first. Alaric and Caelen wait for us at the bottom. If you fall, they\u2019ll catch you. I need you to trust me.\u201d</p><p>She reached up to touch his face, her love and faith soaring in her soul. \u201cI\u2019d fly if you asked me to.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her hard and then lowered her to the floor. He wasted no time securing the rope around her foot so that it fit her like a stirrup. Then he strung the rope from her foot to her hands, looping it around her wrists and palms so she gripped it tight.</p><p>The other end he tied to his waist and he took position just inside the window.</p><p>\u201cStep onto the sill, sweeting. Very carefully put your feet against the wall of the castle and keep them there so you don\u2019t scrape against the st as I lower you. Try to remain upright.\u201d</p><p>\u2019Twas insanity, what he was asking her to do, and yet she climbed onto the ledge, holding on to his shoulders for dear life.</p><p>He grabbed the rope just inches from her hands and braced himself as she started to climb over. Inch by inch she lowered her foot until it scraped against the side of the stone wall.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, lass. Go slow and be careful. I\u2019ve got you. I won\u2019t let you go.\u201d</p><p>Sliding over the sill was the hardest thing she\u2019d ever done. And then she simply let go. She spiraled downward, hitting her feet against the wall as she struggled to gain her footing. She threw back her head and saw Ewan fighting with all his strength to slow her descent. The rope had to burn his hands and yet he hung on.</p><p>She jammed both feet against the wall and gripped the rope with all her might. Halfway down she finally managed to control her descent by walking down the wall with her feet. When finally she neared the bottom, Alaric and Caelen reached up and grabbed her waist. They lowered her to the ground and quickly untied the rope so Ewan could pull it back up.</p><p>\u201cHow will he get down?\u201d she whispered urgently.</p><p>They ignored her and stared upward, waiting for Ewan. Several long minutes later, she saw his dark figure coming down the rope, hand over hand, his feet against the wall as hers had been.</p><p>When he reached a safe distance, he dropped the rest of the way, landing with a soft thump beside her. She reached for his hands and, as she suspected, they were torn and raw. Her throat swelled and she kissed each palm, holding them reverently in her own hands.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Alaric hissed. \u201cGannon is waiting with the horses.\u201d</p><p>They ducked and ran toward the stone skirt in the distance. Alaric tossed up another rope and the hook hit the stone ledge at the top with a clink. Wasting no time, Alaric scrambled up the wall and lay along the top, his hand extended down for Mairin.</p><p>Ewan hoisted her high over his head and urged her to reach for Alaric\u2019s hand. Their fingers glanced off each other before Alaric finally captured her hand and slid his fingers down to grasp her wrist.</p><p>Ewan pushed upward and Alaric pulled her up with incredible strength.</p><p>\u201cGrab onto the ledge and pull yourself over,\u201d Alaric hissed.</p><p>As he swung her up, she lunged for the top of the wall and rolled up so she was head to head with Alaric.</p><p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d Alaric said. \u201cSit up and straddle the wall. As quietly as you can, scoot back until you give Caelen enough room to scramble over. He\u2019ll go down and then you\u2019ll drop down next. I\u2019ll stay up to help Ewan over. His hands are too damaged to climb up another rope.\u201d</p><p>With some hesitation, she swung one leg over so she straddled the wall and quickly pushed herself back until there was enough space for Caelen to climb the wall.</p><p>Moments later, he swung over the top and then dropped down on the other side.</p><p>\u201cTake my hand and I\u2019ll lower you over the side. Listen for Caelen and when he tells you, let go. He\u2019ll catch you,\u201d Alaric instructed her.</p><p>Swallowing back her fear, she grasped Alaric\u2019s hand and slid over the side. She dropped, her feet scraping the side of the wall to slow her momentum. Alaric caught her wrist and nearly pulled her arm from its socket.</p><p>\u201cLet go,\u201d Caelen called up. \u201cI\u2019ve got you, Mairin.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, kicked away from the wall, and let go of Alaric\u2019s hand. She needn\u2019t have worried. Caelen didn\u2019t even stagger under her weight as he caught her against his chest. Still she threw her arms around his neck, hugging him with fierce gratitude for not allowing her to fall.</p><p>He gently pried her arms away from his neck and set her down on her feet. Her knees buckled and she clutched at his hand so she wouldn\u2019t fall.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all right now,\u201d Caelen said in a low, reassuring voice. He caught her to his side to steady her as they waited for Ewan and Alaric to descend.</p><p>Ewan dropped down first and Mairin threw herself into his arms. She hugged him so fiercely that he likely couldn\u2019t draw breath, but she didn\u2019t care. She was in his arms. He was taking her from Duncan Cameron.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d Alaric urged when he dropped to the ground.</p><p>\u201cGannon is waiting with the horses.\u201d</p><p>They raced for the cover of the trees. Just inside the forest, Gannon stood with their horses and Ewan urged her toward his steed.</p><p>Alaric and Caelen swung into the saddles. Cormac was already astride his horse and Gannon mounted his. Ewan took to his saddle in one quick motion and then he simply reached down, plucked Mairin off the ground, and settled her in front of him.</p><p>She laid her head on Ewan\u2019s chest and slipped her arm around his waist. Tears fell freely now, but she did nothing to distract him from his concentration. If Cameron discovered her gone, he would pursue with the might of his entire army, and Ewan would be slowed by bearing her with him.</p><p>Only when they were miles away did she turn her face upward. \u201cEwan?\u201d</p><p>He dropped a kiss on the top of her head. \u201cNot now, sweeting. We\u2019ll talk when we reach McCabe land. We aren\u2019t stopping until we reach our border. Sleep now.\u201d</p><p>It was on the tip of her tongue to ask him how he thought she\u2019d sleep now, but before they\u2019d gone another mile, her exhaustion caught up with her. After so many nights of not sleeping for fear of what Duncan might do, she was now safe in her husband\u2019s arms. She laid her head back on his broad chest and allowed the steady motion of the horse to lull her into sleep.</p><p>Ewan rode with one hand holding the reins, the other wrapped solidly around his wife. He set a grueling pace that his men were only too happy to keep. They would not stop to sleep or eat until they reached their border.</p><p>CHAPTER 37</p><p>True to Ewan\u2019s word, he didn\u2019t stop for more than a few minutes until they were just outside the border of McCabe land. They pushed through the nights, the pace that Ewan set inhuman.</p><p>Mairin rode with Ewan, and when she wasn\u2019t sleeping, Ewan was feeding her from the burlap sack attached to his saddle. His men looked gray with exhaustion but no one offered a single complaint. The journey was eerily silent, with neither Caelen nor Alaric offering conversation. They were too focused on making sure they weren\u2019t pursued.</p><p>\u201cEwan, I have need to stop,\u201d she whispered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan you wait just a few more miles?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe\u2019ll be on McCabe land soon.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not. The child I carry makes it hard to hold it in.\u201d</p><p>His smile was fleeting as he called a halt. He eased her down from the saddle, and she nearly went down in a heap. Gannon was there to catch her and she nearly wept in gratitude when he offered her a reassuring smile.</p><p>To Gannon\u2019s utter shock, she threw her arms around him and hugged him fiercely. His hands went up and he stammered as he tried to ask her what she was about.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered. She pulled away and smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cFor what, my lady?\u201d he asked in confusion.</p><p>\u201cFor coming for me.\u201d</p><p>She turned then and went in search of a private area to relieve herself.</p><p>Ewan smiled and watched as his wife ducked behind a tree in the distance. She had stunned Gannon with her gratitude. If he had to guess, all his men would be the recipients of her affection before it was over with.</p> <p>A moment later, Mairin returned and Ewan absorbed the vision of her holding a protective hand over her small, round belly. It staggered him just how relieved he was to have her home, or nearly so. He\u2019d pushed his men hard, afraid that Duncan would pursue them and Mairin would be caught solidly in the middle as they would do battle. He wanted her safe. He wanted her far removed from the inevitable bloodshed between him and Cameron. The bastard\u2019s days were numbered, and no matter that Ewan defied the king himself, he\u2019d avenge his wife.</p><p>As he was reaching down to pull Mairin into the saddle, he realized that he no longer sought vengeance for the wrong done to his father and their clan. He sought vengeance for a beautiful lass who had more hurt in her blue eyes than he ever wanted to see in a lifetime.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re nearly home,\u201d he whispered in her ear.</p><p>She turned and looked up at him with sadness and pleading in her eyes. \u201cAs soon as we cross over to McCabe land, can you send your men ahead? I must talk with you, Ewan. \u2019Tis important that I do so before we arrive at the keep. Once we ride into the courtyard, we\u2019ll be pulled this way and that. We have to settle this. We must.\u201d</p><p>He touched her face and tried to smooth the lines of worry from her brow. What on earth worried her so? Dread gripped his heart at the depth of sadness in her gaze. He prayed for the strength to endure the telling of it all. \u201cAye, lass, we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, he reined in his horse and then motioned the others to go ahead.</p> <p>Caelen and Alaric approached on their horses and stopped beside Ewan and Mairin.</p><p>Alaric frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t like leaving you alone, Ewan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re far enough onto our land now. I have need for some time alone with my wife. We\u2019ll be along in a while. Go ahead and announce that I\u2019m bringing her safely home.\u201d</p><p>With reluctance, Alaric and Caelen rode ahead. Their pace picked up as they started down the mountain toward the last stretch home. Soon the others followed suit, spurring their mounts to a gallop and then a run.</p><p>Shouts filled the air. Whoops and cries of triumph filled Ewan\u2019s ears, and he couldn\u2019t help but smile. But when he looked down at Mairin, her eyes were troubled and filled with grief.</p><p>His heart turned over and he closed his eyes as he prepared to hear of all that Duncan had done to her. A part of him didn\u2019t want to know. He wanted to forget it\u2014wanted her to forget it\u2014so they could put it solidly in the past. But he also knew she\u2019d have need of telling it, so she could rid her system of the poison Cameron had inflicted.</p><p>He got down from his horse and then reached up to gently take her from the saddle. He carried her to a patch of thick grass that was warmed by the sun. He sat down on the ground and nestled her firmly into his arms.</p><p>He could scarcely credit that they were on his lands and she was back in his arms. The last week had been a test of his endurance. At his lowest point, he wondered if he\u2019d ever see her again. He never wanted his faith tested in such a manner again.</p> <p>\u201cI did a terrible thing,\u201d she choked out.</p><p>Ewan pulled back in surprise, his brow furrowed in confusion. \u201cWhat are you speaking of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agreed. God help me, I agreed to a devil\u2019s bargain in order to keep our child safe. I was disloyal to you, Ewan, for I vowed I\u2019d lie and support Duncan\u2019s claim in exchange for our child\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>Ewan swallowed back his own grief at the desperation in her voice. \u201cShh,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll never believe for a moment that you were sloyalyal to me.\u201d</p><p>Pain filled Mairin\u2019s eyes. \u201cHe wanted to make me miscarry our child. He was going to force me to drink a potion. I would have said and done anything to save our baby. I convinced him that if I miscarried, as far along as I was, that there was a chance I wouldn\u2019t bear another child. I convinced him that the logical thing to do was to carry on the avowal that it was his child, for as long as I delivered a child, he would control Neamh \u00c1lainn regardless whose babe it was. He agreed, but even then I was afraid to eat or sleep because I worried he\u2019d go back on his word and eliminate our baby.\u201d</p><p>Ewan gathered her in his arms and rocked her back and forth, his eyes closed at the terror she\u2019d lived in. No wonder she was so thin. She hadn\u2019t eaten for fear she\u2019d lose her child. His child.</p><p>\u201cYour brilliance amazes me, lass. To have thought of a solution so quickly. I\u2019m humbled by your courage and daring. No child could have a fiercer mother. Our son or daughter will be blessed beyond measure.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him, hope lighting her eyes for the first time. \u201cYou aren\u2019t angry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I be angry at a woman who\u2019d sacrifice everything to keep my child from harm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ewan,\u201d she whispered. And then her eyes clouded again and she looked down.</p><p>He nudged her chin upward with a tender gesture. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agreed to be his wife. I agreed to never deny him.\u201d She closed her eyes as tears slipped in silvery trails down her cheeks.</p><p>For a moment Ewan didn\u2019t breathe. He couldn\u2019t imagine such a sacrifice. His chest ached as he finally sucked air into his lungs. But if she could find the courage to tell him all, he would find the courage to hear it. \u201cTell me, sweeting. Did he ... Did he hurt you?\u201d</p><p>The words spilled painfully from his lips. His throat threatened to close at what he imagined she might have endured.</p><p>\u201cI ... I vomited on him the first time he tried. I blamed it on my pregnancy, but it was God\u2019s truth the idea of him bedding me made me ill. Afterward he seemed afraid I\u2019d repeat the insult so he stayed away from me.\u201d</p><p>Ewan\u2019s relief was so great that it made him light-headed. He gathered her in his arms and held on, just absorbing the feel of her in his grasp after so many weeks. And then he chuckled, the image of her retching all over Cameron amusing him to no end.</p><p>She looked up at him, her eyes shining so brightly that he lost himself in the deep pools. The light dimmed for a moment and she frowned.</p><p>\u201cEwan, what about the dowry? Is it lost to us forever?\u201d</p><p>Ewan sighed. \u201cIt was awarded to Cameron. I\u2019ve no doubt that he\u2019ll receive it whether you\u2019re in residence or not. Archibald, and possibly the king himself, is in league with Cameron.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes and she hung her head. \u201cEverything you married me for hasn\u2019t come to pass. Our clan needs food and clothing. Our soldiers need supplies. We have need of repairs. How are we going to survive, Ewan?\u201d</p><p>He caught her face between his hands and stared down into her eyes. \u201cYou are everything to me, Mairin. I can go without food. The keep can crumble. But I can\u2019t live without you. We\u2019ll make it. We\u2019ve always made it. Somehow we\u2019ll see it through. But I cannot live my life without you. If the dowry never comes to pass. If we never claim Neamh \u00c1lainn. As long as I have you, lass. As long as I have you.\u201d</p><p>She threw herself around him and hugged him until he couldn\u2019t breathe. Her body shook as tears slipped down his neck. He didn\u2019t chide her, though, because it was God\u2019s truth he wanted to cry himself.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Ewan. Thank God you came for me.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his forehead to hers as their lips danced ever closer to each other. \u201cI\u2019d battle the fires of hell to bring you home, lass. Now let\u2019s ride on. Our son misses his mother and our clan misses their mistress.\u201d</p><p>The entire clan was assembled in the courtyard when Ewan rode across the bridge, Mairin held solidly before him in the saddle.</p><p>Her head rested against his chest and her hair streamed down her back, the ends lifting in the slight breeze.</p><p>His clansmen all leaned forward, and their need to see that their mistress was well was visible on each of their faces.</p><p>Ewan came to a halt and pulled back the blanket that shielded Mairin from view. The courtyard erupted in a chorus of cheers.</p><p>Mairin straightened in his hold and smiled back at her clan. Tears shone in her eyes and she offered a reassuring wave.</p><p>\u201cMama! Mama!\u201d</p><p>Crispen bolted through the crowd and ran straight for Ewan\u2019s horse. Ewan smiled down at his son.</p><p>\u201cStay right there, lad. I\u2019ll hand your mother down.\u201d</p><p>Crispen\u2019s and Mairin\u2019s smiles lit up the entire courtyard. Something inside of Ewan shifted and clenched until his chest ached. With love.</p><p>Alaric and Caelen came forward and Ewan handed Mairin down to them while he dismounted. As he\u2019d expected, she threw her arms first around Alaric and squeezed until he laughingly begged for mercy. Then she let him go and turned to Caelen, who already had his hands up to ward her off. Paying him no mind, she launched herself at him and he had no choice but to catch her so she didn\u2019t fall. She hugged him fiercely, babbling her thanks all the while.</p><p>\u201cYou daft woman,\u201d Caelen muttered. \u201cDid you honestly think we\u2019d leave you to that pig?\u201d He tweaked her chin and she beamed up at him before hugging him all over again.</p><p>Caelen goaned and turned her around in her husband\u2019s direction. Ewan was only too happy to gather her in his arms and swing her around.</p><p>\u201cPut her down, Papa! I want to hug Mama.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, Ewan set her on her feet and Crispen promptly threw his arms around her waist. Tearfully, Mairin gathered him in her arms and proceeded to kiss every inch of his hair.</p><p>Alaric and Caelen looked on indulgently, but Ewan could see in their eyes the clear affection they had for his wife. She had conquered them all. Ewan. His brothers. His men. Their clan.</p><p>He held up his hand to silence the uproar around them.</p><p>\u201cToday is a truly glorious day,\u201d he said to the gathered clan. \u201cOur lady is returned to us at last. She made incredible sacrifices to keep our child safe and the McCabe legacy alive. She worried that the loss of her dowry would somehow dampen our enthusiasm for her return when indeed she is our greatest treasure.\u201d</p><p>He turned then to Mairin and slowly went down on one knee in front of her. \u201cYou are my greatest treasure,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Around him, his men also went down on one knee, their swords drawn and pointed in her direction. Alaric and Caelen both stepped forward. Ewan saw the question in her eyes. Then they both went on bended knee in front of her.</p><p>It was too much for his tenderhearted wife. She wept as noisily as a newborn babe. No one seemed to mind. Smiles shone on the faces of his exhausted men.</p><p>\u201cOh, Ewan,\u201d she cried, as she launched herself toward him.</p><p>He had no choice but to catch her, though they still landed on the ground in a tangle of arms and legs. She loomed over him and peppered his face and neck with kisses.</p><p>She was crying so hard that twice her lips slipped off his face and glanced off his ears.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she wept. \u201cNever did I dream that I\u2019d find a man like you.\u201d</p><p>Ewan caught her in his arms and gazed lovingly into her eyes.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis a known fact that you were God\u2019s gift to this clan, lass. And to me. Especially to me,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>A resounding cheer nearly deafened him. Mairin clapped her hands over her ears, but her smile was enough to light up the darkest winter night.</p><p>Not caring who saw him or what conclusion they drew, he rolled to his feet, swung her into his arms, and started for the steps of the keep.</p><p>\u201cEwan, what are you doing?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He silenced her with a kiss as he walked inside the hall. \u201cHush, wife. Don\u2019t question me. I have a pressing need to experience my wife\u2019s indecency.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 38</p><p>Mairin stared longingly over the rolling terrain, the earth bursting with green, and inhaled the sweetly perfumed air of summer. She itched to leave the keep, even if just to walk about the courtyard, but Ewan had expressly forbidden her to leave the safety of the walls, and he had enough worries without her adding to them.</p><p>The McCabe clan readied for war. It wasn\u2019t an outward cry but rather a quiet readying of the men and their weapons. They were resigned to their fate as enemies of the crown and of Duncan Cameron.</p><p>Mairin left the window and descended the stairs to the hall, where she found Gannon and Cormac eating the noon meal with their soldiers. She waved her hand for them to continue eating. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just going into the kitchens to see Gertie,\u201d she called as she walked by. \u201cI won\u2019t venture farther than that.\u201d</p><p>Gannon nodded but kept an eye on her progress. \u201cStay where I can see you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and stepped inside the door but remained where Gannon could see her from where he sat.</p><p>Only, Gertie wasn\u2019t tending the fire as was her habit. Mairin sniffed the air. No bread was baking either, which was unusual given that Gertie always had a loaf baking, day or night. Mairin often wondered when the woman took her rest.</p> <p>Perhaps she\u2019d stepped into the larder. Aye, that was likely, and if so, she\u2019d return in a moment\u2019s time. Gertie wouldn\u2019t leave an unattended fire for more than a few seconds.</p><p>But when Gertie didn\u2019t return, Mairin frowned. A noise that sounded like a moan coming from the larder spurred her into action. She rushed through the kitchen and stepped inside the small room, her gaze seeking Gertie.</p><p>There crumpled on the floor lay Gertie, blood trickling down her temple. Mairin rushed forward to kneel by the older woman. Then she turned, prepared to call for Gannon, when a hand clamped over her mouth and an arm jerked her from the floor against a hard body.</p><p>\u201cNot a sound, my lady.\u201d</p><p>She managed to free her mouth. \u201cDiormid?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSilence,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>Her shock wore off and gave way to burning rage. \u201cYou dare to show yourself on McCabe land? You\u2019ll not live to see another sunrise. My husband will kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are my passage to freedom,\u201d he gritted out next to her ear.</p><p>The unmistakable feel of a blade cutting into her dress over her belly sent a shiver up Mairin\u2019s spine. He held the knife so close she could barely move for fear of being cut.</p><p>Diormid\u2019s grip tightened on her and he laid the flat of the blade against her now bare belly. \u201cListen well. If you do anything foolish, I19;ll slice open your belly and spill the babe onto the ground. If I fail to bring you back to Cameron, I die. If I\u2019m caught on McCabe land, I die. I have nothing to lose, Lady McCabe, and I assure you, if you draw attention to us, I\u2019ll kill you and your babe before I die.\u201d</p><p>For some reason his words infuriated her rather than struck fear in her heart. She was tired of the endless fear they all lived in. She was tired of seeing the worry in Ewan\u2019s eyes. He didn\u2019t sleep well. He wasn\u2019t eating properly. All because he feared the implications of the choices he\u2019d made as laird.</p> <p>She fingered the dagger attached to her belt. Caelen had gifted it to her upon their return to McCabe keep. His thought was that there was no reason a lass shouldn\u2019t be able to defend herself if the situation arose.</p><p>She found in this moment she was in complete agreement.</p><p>Careful not to upset Diormid in any way, she nodded her agreement. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll do whatever you wish. I\u2019ve no desire for harm to come to my child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe go out the back, where the skirt crumbles. My horse waits in the trees. If anyone sees you, you are to call out that Gertie has need of the healer.\u201d</p><p>Mairin nodded. Diormid\u2019s hand closed around her nape while his other hand still gripped the knife against her belly. As soon as she felt the metal leave her flesh, she whirled, her dagger in hand.</p><p>In Diormid\u2019s surprise, his knife swung up, slicing her upper arm. But the pain barely registered, so intent was she on her task.</p><p>She rammed her knee right between his legs and at the same time sank her dagger deep in his belly. He staggered back and then went down hard, his hands going to his groin. He was crying far more piteously than Heath had done when Ewan gave him the same treatment.</p><p>Wanting to make sure he was incapacitated, she grabbed one of the heavy cooking pots from the floor and bashed him over the head. He went immediately still, sprawled on the floor, arms and legs thrown wide. Only the hilt of her dagger shone against his belly. No part of the blade was visible. It was buried too deeply in his flesh.</p> <p>Satisfied that he wasn\u2019t going anywhere for the moment, she turned and fled, yelling for Gannon as she went.</p><p>As she entered the kitchen, she ran full tilt into Gannon and bounced off. She would have fallen had he not grasped her arms to steady her. Then he saw her torn dress, and his expression grew stormy.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, my lady? What\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>Before she could respond, he shoved her behind him and drew his sword.</p><p>\u201cThere is something I must show you,\u201d she said urgently. \u201cWell, that is, I need you to stand guard while I fetch Ewan.\u201d</p><p>Without awaiting his response, she ran around him and tugged at his hand, pulling him into the storage room. She pointed at Diormid sprawled on the floor. \u201cI must fetch Ewan. Can you make certain he doesn\u2019t move until I get back?\u201d</p><p>Gannon\u2019s face clouded with fury as he looked on the man he\u2019d trusted and called brother-in-arms. Then he looked up at Mairin in astonishment. \u201cMy lady, what did you do to him?\u201d</p><p>At his question, the events of the last moments caught up to her hard and fast. Realization set in as to just how close she and her babe had come to harm. Her hands began shaking and her stomach rebelled. She turned and retched violently. She bent double and held her middle as she heaved onto the floor. Tears burned her eyes as she sucked in steadying breaths in an attempt to quiet her roiling stomach.</p><p>\u201cMy lady, are you hurt? What has happened?\u201d Gannon asked worriedly.</p><p>She straightened and put her hand on Gannon\u2019s arm to steady herself. \u201cDo I have your promise, Gannon? You\u2019ll make sure he doesn\u2019t move until I return with Ewan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already here, lass. The entire keep heard your bellow,\u201d Ewans\u2019 voice sounded behind her.</p><p>She whirled in its direction to see him and his brothers standing in the doorway and promptly regretted her action. Nausea billowed up her throat and she bent over once again.</p><p>It was Caelen who put an arm around her and held her as spasms overtook her. Ewan was too busy surveying the scene in front of him.</p><p>\u201cWhat in God\u2019s name happened?\u201d Ewan roared. \u201cHow did he get into our larder?\u201d He turned on Gannon. \u201cHave you an explanation for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, Laird, I do not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGertie,\u201d Mairin choked out. \u201cEwan, she\u2019s injured.\u201d</p><p>Ewan motioned for Gannon to see to Gertie, who still lay on the floor a short distance away. Gannon lifted Gertie in his arms and carried her from the larder. She was already coming around and protesting loudly that she could walk under her own power. Ewan turned to Mairin, who shook like a leaf against Caelen\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened, lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe cut my dress,\u201d she said, as she held up the tattered material of her skirts. \u201cHe threatened to cut the babe from my womb if I didn\u2019t cooperate.\u201d</p><p>Alaric stared at her in astonishment. \u201cIf he held a knife to your belly, how in God\u2019s name did he wind up unconscious on the floor with your dagger in his belly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took a page from Ewan\u2019s book,\u201d she said primly.</p><p>Ewan raised an eyebrow and exchanged glances with Caelen.</p><p>\u201cThis I\u2019ve got to hear,\u201d Caelen muttered.</p><p>\u201cI kneed him ... down there. And well, I plunged my dagger into his belly at the same time. When he fell, I wanted to make sure he didn\u2019t escape, so I bashed him over the head with a pot.\u201d</p><p>Alaric winced. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was going anywhere, lass.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201c \u2019Tis the truth I wanted to kill him. He threatened my child.\u201d</p><p>Caelen chuckled. \u201cI don\u2019t think Crispen or your other children will ever have to worry about coming to harm, Ewan. Your wife will single-handedly take on any threat to her young.\u201d</p><p>Ewan pulled Mairin against his side and kissed the top of her head. \u201cAre you all right, sweeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>He took his hand away from her arm and frowned when he saw blood on it. \u201cThen what is this?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She shrugged, remembering now that Diormid had cut her in the scuffle. \u201c \u2019Tis naught but a scratch, Laird. I will wash it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s to be done with Diormid, Laird?\u201d Cormac asked from the doorway.</p><p>Ewan\u2019s expression blackened, but then he glanced at Mairin, likely remembering her aversion to having Heath killed for his infraction.</p><p>\u201cI think he should be fed to a pack of wild wolves,\u201d Mairin muttered. \u201cPerhaps tied between two trees and left to bleed to attract predators.\u201d</p><p>Ewan and his brothers gaped at her in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cOr we could simply drag him behind a horse for a few miles?\u201d she asked hopefully.</p><p>Caelen died laughing. \u201cBloodthirsty lass. I love it! She\u2019s fierce, Ewan. I like your wife very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would,\u201d Ewan muttered.</p><p>Ewan looked at his wife in exasperation. \u201cI was going to suggest we kill him and get it over with since he\u2019s not going to survive your dagger to the belly anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis too quick a death,\u201d she said with a sniff. \u201cI think he should be made to suffer.\u201d</p><p>Ewan frowned and she relented with a sigh. \u201cOh, very well. Kill him quickly. But he\u2019s not to be buried on McCabe land. You can feed his corpse to the buzzards, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Ewan shook his head and laughed at her hopeful tone. He gathered her in his arms and squeezed her until she couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cAye, lass, we can feed his corpse to the predators. Will it make you feel better to imagine his eyeballs plucked from their sockets?\u201d</p><p>Her stomach recoiled at the image and she put a hand to her mouth to staunch the urge to retch again. Then she glared up at her husband. \u201cYou did that apurpose!\u201d</p><p>He grinthen turned to his brothers. \u201cSee to his body. I\u2019m taking my wife back to the hall.\u201d</p><p>Mairin let Ewan guide her away but then she stopped and called back. \u201cI\u2019ll be wanting my dagger returned, Caelen.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 39</p><p>\u201cLaird! Laird! The king approaches!\u201d</p><p>Ewan dropped Mairin\u2019s hand and hurried into the hall where Owain was shouting for him. The young man had obviously run the entire way, for he stood panting for breath as he frantically searched the hall for Ewan.</p><p>When he saw Ewan, he hurried over and once again repeated his announcement.</p><p>\u201cHold!\u201d Ewan bit out. \u201cTell me all. How far is the king? Does he ride with his army?\u201d</p><p>Before Owain could answer, another of Ewan\u2019s soldiers ran into the hall. \u201cLaird! McDonald rides through our gates!\u201d</p><p>Ewan stalked toward the courtyard, Mairin on his heels. He got to the steps as Laird McDonald slid from his horse. Beyond the gates of the keep, what looked to be McDonald\u2019s entire army spread out over the terrain.</p><p>\u201cEwan!\u201d McDonald called. \u201cMy men brought news that the king\u2019s army approaches.\u201d</p><p>Not a moment after Laird McDonald\u2019s pronouncement, the McDonald army parted to allow Laird McLauren to ride over the bridge and into the courtyard. In the distance, McLauren\u2019s army gathered at the rear of McDonald\u2019s men.</p><p>\u201cEwan,\u201d McLauren greeted as he approached the two lairds. \u201cI came as soon as I heard.\u201d</p><p>Ewan looked at the two men in surprise. The sight of so many soldiers on horseback was an impressive sight, spreading as far as the eye could see.</p><p>\u201cDo you realize that by your actions, you actively rebel against the crown? You\u2019ll be branded outlaws,\u201d Ewan said.</p><p>Laird McLauren scowled. \u201c \u2019Tis wrong what he did, Ewan. If he takes a man\u2019s wife, what\u2019s next? His lands? I stand beside you, as do my men.\u201d</p><p>Laird McDonald nodded his agreement.</p><p>Ewan grasped the forearm of Laird McLauren and then turned to do the same to McDonald. Then he threw his fist in the air and gave a war cry that was picked up by his men and spread to the McDonalds and the McLaurens. Soon the hills surrounding the keep echoed with the sound of impending battle.</p><p>He turned to Mairin and took her hands in his. \u201cI want you to take Crispen and remain behind the walls of the keep. Do not come out until I\u2019ve summoned you. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded her understanding, her eyes wide with fright.</p><p>He bent and kissed her. \u201cDo not be afraid, Mairin. We will prevail this day. Now go tend to that cut on your arm.\u201d</p><p>She touched his face. \u201cI know we will.\u201d</p><p>She turned and called for Crispen. Then she issued a sharp order for all the women of the keep to retreat behind the walls.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll greet our king at the border of my lands,\u201d Ewan declared. He ordered his men to mount their horses and they rode out, the McDonald and the McLauren men behind them.</p><p>Ewan was sick at heart but resolute in his position against the crown. The life he was forging for himself and Mairin and their children wasn\u2019t an easy one. Their name would forever be associated with dishonor. A hero to some, an outlaw to most.</p><p>If keeping the woman he loved by his side was a cause for dishonor, he was prepared to wear the mantle for the rest of his days.</p><p>When they arrived at their border, Ewan was surprised to see the king mounted atop his horse with only an escort of half a dozen men. He waited beyond the border, making no effort to cross over onto Ewan\u2019s lands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs this some trick?\u201d McLauren murmured beside Ewan. \u201cWhere are the rest of his men? \u2019Tis suicide to come without his army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemain here,\u201d Ewan said grimly. He motioned for his brothers and Gannon and Cormac, and rode forward until he was just before the king but still on McCabe land.</p><p>The king looked tired and as if he still suffered the effects of his illness. His face was drawn and pale and his shoulders sagged precariously.</p><p>\u201cYour Majesty,\u201d Ewan acknowledged. \u201cWhy have you come to my borders?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to correct a wrong. And to thank you.\u201d</p><p>Of all the things Ewan thought his king might say, that wasn\u2019t one of them. He cocked his head to the side but didn\u2019t say anything, instead waiting for the king to explain.</p><p>\u201cYou come with the might of not only your army, but that of the McDonald and the McLauren clans,\u201d the king said. \u201cTell me, Laird McCabe, would you have fought me this day had I come under the declaration of war?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Ewan said without hesitation.</p><p>Amusement gleamed in the king\u2019s eyes. \u201cBy doing so, you would brand yourself an outcast for the rest of your days?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly if I lost,\u201d Ewan drawled. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t plan to lose.\u201d</p><p>The king shifted on his saddle. \u201cI would meet my niece, Laird McCabe.\u201d</p><p>Ewan leveled a stare at King David, unflustered by the abrupt change in topic. \u201cI\u2019ll not allow Mairin outside my walls.\u201d</p><p>The king nodded approvingly. \u201cWhich is why I hope you invite me within. We have much to discuss, and as I stated, I have much to thank you for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be a trick,\u201d Alaric muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll enter alone,\u201d Ewan said. \u201cYour men remain outside the walls.\u201d</p> <p>The king arched one eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me to have that much trust in a man who\u2019s admitted he has no issue with killing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf all I wanted was to kill you, you\u2019d already be dead,\u201d Ewan said calmly.</p><p>David studied him for a moment longer and then slowly nodded. \u201cVery well then. I\u2019ll ride with you into the keep. My men will escort me as far as your gate.\u201d</p><p>Ewan turned and gave his men the signal to hold. Then he motioned for David to follow him. Ewan\u2019s brothers flanked the king as they rode back toward the keep.</p><p>True to his word, David signaled his men to halt when they reached the bridge across the loch. The McDonald and the McLauren men remained behind while Ewan\u2019s men tramped across the bridge behind their laird.</p><p>They dismounted and David slid from his horse and wavered unsteadily on his feet. Ewan frowned but did nothing to shame his king by offering aid in front of his men.</p><p>\u201cLaird, shall I send for Lady McCabe?\u201d Cormac whispered.</p><p>Ewan shook his head. \u201cNay, and in fact, I want you to go to your mistress and make sure she remains in her chamber until I summon her. Protect her well, Cormac, until I know all that transpires here.\u201d</p> <p>Cormac nodded and hurried away.</p><p>The men entered the hall and Ewan called for ale and light refreshment. They sat at the high table and David was quiet as he sipped his ale.</p><p>After a moment he looked at Ewan over the rim of his goblet and chewed his lips in a thoughtful measure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve need of men of your ilk, Ewan. You had every reason to despise me and yet you warned my guard of your suspicion that I was being weakened by men I trusted. \u2019Tis because of that warning that I am alive and in front of you today. Archibald indeed plotted against me with Cameron. Archibald slowly poisoned me over time so it would appear as if I sickened and died of natural causes.\u201d</p><p>The king sighed and set his goblet down. \u201cI would apologize for the wrongs done to you and especially to your lady wife. I would like to meet my niece with your blessing.\u201d</p><p>Ewan regarded his king for a long moment but saw only sincerity reflected in the older man\u2019s eyes. Then he turned to Caelen. \u201cGo and escort Mairin to the hall so that she may meet her uncle.\u201d</p><p>Mairin clutched at Caelen\u2019s arm as they started for the stairs. She\u2019d instructed Crispen to remain behind in her chamber with Maddie, but right now she\u2019d give anything to have someone else to hold on to.</p><p>Caelen paused at the top of the stairs and then he produced her dagger in the small leather sheathe he\u2019d fashioned to attach to her belt.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might like this back,\u201d he said in amusement.</p><p>She reached for the knife and attached it to her belt. \u201cThank you, Caelen. \u2019Twas very thoughtful of you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and squeezed her arm reassuringly. \u201cChin up. A fierce lass such as you bows to no one.\u201d</p><p>They traveled down the stairs and turned the corner into the hall. Across the room, Ewan and the king rose from their seats in acknowledgment of her presence.</p><p>Mairin\u2019s knees knocked together in abject terror. Not terror in that she was afraid the king might harm her. Nay, Ewan was standing right beside the king, and he\u2019d never allow such a thing to happen.</p><p>This was her family, though. Her flesh and blood. Her uncle. And he was the king of Scotland.</p><p>Caelen came to a stop just before the king and loosened his hold on Mairin\u2019s arm, stepping back to allow her the moment with her uncle.</p><p>Remembering that she should show respect for the king, no matter Caelen\u2019s thought that she should bow before no one, she hastily dipped into a sweeping curtsy and prayed she wouldn\u2019t fall at his feet.</p><p>She waited for his permission to rise, but to her surprise, he knelt down in front of her and took her hands in his. He pulled her to her feet, and she was further shocked to see a bright sheen of moisture in his eyes. Eyes that reminded her of her own.</p><p>He looked haggard. Pale and exhausted as if he\u2019d fought a long battle with sickness and had only just begun his recovery. Lines etched deeply into his forehead, and wrinkles marred the corners of his eyes.</p><p>He kept a firm grip on her hands as he held them in the space between his own. \u201cIf I ever had any doubt, I don\u2019t now,\u201d he said in a gruff voice. \u201cYou have the look of my mother, may God rest her soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d Mairin whispered.</p><p>\u201cAye, she was a beautiful woman, kind in spirit and devoted to those in need.\u201d</p><p>Mairin swallowed, overwhelmed by the enormity of this moment. After so long in hiding, of living in fear, she was openly acknowledged by her father\u2019s blood.</p><p>Ewan stepped to her side and wrapped his arm around her waist. The king reluctantly let go of her hands and directed his gaze at Ewan.</p><p>\u201cYou did a good thing, Ewan. The thought of the lass in Duncan Cameron\u2019s hands ...\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI will work to correct the wrongs done to you and your wife. I\u2019ll give public blessing to your marriage and I\u2019ll have her dowry transported immediately under heavy guard from Neamhirit anC1;lainn.\u201d</p><p>Mairin gasped. \u201cI thought my dowry lost to Duncan Cameron.\u201d</p><p>The king shook his head. \u201cArchibald awarded the dowry to Duncan, but he knew not where it was held. Only I have that knowledge as only I was entrusted with Alexander\u2019s legacy bequeathed to the firstborn of his daughter. It has been under lock and key at Neamh \u00c1lainn since Alexander made the bequest so many years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, this is wonderful, Ewan!\u201d she exclaimed as she nearly danced in Ewan\u2019s arms.</p><p>She turned back to her uncle, concerned by his pallor and apparent weakness. \u201cYou would do us great honor if you remained here until your health is restored.\u201d</p><p>The king\u2019s eyes widened in surprise and he looked up to Ewan for confirmation. Ewan shrugged. \u201cI have long determined the foolhardiness in denying my wife anything. Besides, she has the right of it. Until you are at full strength, the threat is still strong to you. You need time to ferret out those who worked with Archibald. We would be honored if you spent the time with us.\u201d</p><p>David smiled broadly. \u201cThen I would be glad to accept your hospitality.\u201d</p><p>In the end, David stayed on for a fortnight, until Mairin\u2019s dowry was delivered. Her husband and the king, after a wary start, actually got along quite famously. They hunted many of the evenings, going out with Ewan\u2019s brothers and returning to drink ale in the hall and argue over who brought in the biggest kill.</p><p>David\u2019s health rapidly improved with Gertie\u2019s cooking and Mairin\u2019s nagging for him to rest. When he rode out with the contingent of soldiers who delivered her dowry, Mairin was actually quite sad to see him go.</p><p>That night, in the privacy of their chamber, Ewan made sweet love to her, and afterward she giggled at the memory of telling her laird he was unskilled at loving.</p><p>\u201cWhat amuses you, wife? \u2019Tis a sin to laugh right after a man has indulged in loving.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and snuggled into his arms. As he always did, he cradled her to him, protectively surrounding her burgeoning belly.</p><p>\u201cI was remembering certain inaccurate assessments I made about your prowess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right you were wrong,\u201d he growled.</p><p>She laughed again and then sighed in contentment. \u201c \u2019Tis a wonderful day, Ewan. Our clan is saved. We can feed our clan, clothe our children, and supply our men with the weapons and armor they so desperately need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, sweeting, \u2019tis a wonderful day.\u201d Then he turned and kissed her until she couldn\u2019t draw breath. He gazed down at her with such tenderness in his eyes that her heart fluttered in her chest. \u201cAlmost as wonderful as the day you first stepped onto McCabe land.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
