Her arms were loaded with mail, groceries and decorations for her Christmas tree. It probably wasn\u2019t a good idea to rush, since the two occupants appeared to be at odds\u2014which could make for an awkward elevator ride\u2014but her arms ached and she didn\u2019t want to wait. Lack of patience had always been one of her weaknesses; equally lacking were several other notable virtues.</p> <p>The man kept the doors from closing. Carrie had noticed him earlier, and so had various other residents. There\u2019d been plenty of speculation about the two latest additions to the apartment complex.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said breathlessly. Her eyes met those of the teenager. The girl was around thirteen, Carrie guessed. They\u2019d moved in a couple of weeks earlier, and from the scuttlebutt Carrie had heard, they\u2019d only be staying until construction on their new home was complete.</p><p>The elevator doors glided shut, as slowly as ever, but then the people who lived in the brick three-story building off Seattle\u2019s Queen Anne Hill weren\u2019t the type to rush. Carrie was the exception.</p><p>\u201cWhat floor?\u201d the man asked.</p><p>Carrie shifted her burdens and managed to slip her mail inside her grocery bag. \u201cSecond. Thanks.\u201d</p> <p>The thirtysomething man sent her a benign smile as he pushed the button. He stared pointedly away from her and the teenager.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Mackenzie Lark,\u201d the girl said, smiling broadly. The surly tone was gone. \u201cThis is my dad, Philip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Carrie Weston.\u201d By balancing the groceries on one knee she was able to offer Mackenzie her hand. \u201cWelcome.\u201d</p><p>Philip shook her hand next, his grip firm and solid, his clasp brief. He glared at his daughter as though to say this wasn\u2019t the time for social pleasantries.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to meet you,\u201d Mackenzie continued, ignoring her father. \u201cYou look like the only normal person in the entire building.\u201d</p><p>Carrie smiled despite her effort not to. \u201cI take it you met Madame Frederick.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that a real crystal ball?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she claims.\u201d Carrie remembered the first time she\u2019d seen Madame Frederick, who\u2019d stepped into the hallway carrying her crystal ball, predicting everything from the weather to a Nordstrom shoe sale. Carrie hadn\u2019t known what to think. She\u2019d plastered herself against the wall and waited for Madame Frederick to pass. The crystal ball hadn\u2019t unnerved her as much as the green emeralds glued over each eyebrow. She wore a sort of caftan, with billowing yards of colorful material about her arms and hips; it hugged her legs from the knees down. Her long, silver-white hair was arranged in an updo like that of a prom queen straight out of the sixties.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s nice,\u201d Mackenzie remarked. \u201cEven if she\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you met Arnold yet?\u201d Carrie asked. He was another of the more eccentric occupants, and one of her favorites.</p><p>\u201cIs he the one with all the cats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArnold\u2019s the weight lifter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy who used to work for the circus?\u201d</p><p>Carrie nodded, and was about to say more when the elevator came to a bumpy halt and sighed loudly as the doors opened. \u201cIt was a pleasure to meet you both,\u201d she said on her way out the door.</p> <p>\u201cSame here,\u201d Philip muttered, and although he glanced in her direction, Carrie had the impression that he wasn\u2019t really seeing her. She had the distinct notion that if she\u2019d been standing there nude he wouldn\u2019t have noticed or, for that matter, cared.</p><p>The doors started to shut when Mackenzie yelled, \u201cCan I come over and talk to you sometime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d The elevator closed, but not before Carrie heard the girl\u2019s father voice his disapproval. She didn\u2019t know if the two of them were continuing their disagreement, or if this had to do with Mackenzie inviting herself over to visit.</p><p>Holding her bags, Carrie had some difficulty unlocking and opening her apartment door without dropping everything. She slammed it closed with one foot and dumped the Christmas ornaments on the sofa, then hauled everything else into her small kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d been wanting to meet him,\u201d she said aloud. \u201cNow you have.\u201d She hated to admit it, but Philip Lark had been a disappointment. He showed about as much interest in her as he would a loaf of bread in the bakery window. Well, what did she expect? The fact that she expected anything was because she\u2019d listened to Madame Frederick one too many times. The older woman claimed to see Carrie\u2019s future and predicted that, before the end of the year, she\u2019d meet the man of her dreams when he moved into this very building. Yeah, right. She refused to put any credence into that prophecy. Madame Frederick was a sweet, rather strange old lady with a romantic heart.</p><p>Carrie pulled out the mail, scanned the envelopes and, except for two Christmas cards and a bill, threw the rest in the garbage. She\u2019d just started to unpack her groceries when there was a knock at the door.</p><p>\u201cHello again,\u201d Mackenzie Lark said cheerfully when Carrie opened the door. The quickness of her return took Carrie by surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou said I could come see you,\u201d the teenager reminded her.</p><p>\u201cSure, come on in.\u201d Mackenzie walked into the apartment, glanced around admiringly and then collapsed onto the sofa.</p><p>\u201cAre you still fighting with your dad?\u201d Carrie asked. She\u2019d had some real go-rounds with her mother before Charlotte married Jason Manning ten years earlier. At the time, Carrie and her mother had been constantly at odds. Carrie knew she was to blame, in part, but she was also aware that her mother had been lonely and unhappy.</p><p>Hindsight told her that the root of their problem had been her parents\u2019 divorce. Carrie didn\u2019t remember a lot about her father\u2014her parents had separated when she was four or five. As she grew older, she came to resent that she didn\u2019t have a father, and for reasons that were never clear, she\u2019d blamed her mother.</p><p>\u201cDad doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d Mackenzie lowered her eyes, her mouth turned down.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Carrie asked gently.</p><p>The girl stood and walked over to the kitchen and watched Carrie put away groceries. She folded her arms on the counter and then rested her chin there. \u201cEverything. We can\u2019t talk without fighting. It\u2019s tough being a teenager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might find this difficult to believe, but it\u2019s just as difficult raising one,\u201d Carrie said.</p><p>Mackenzie sighed. \u201cIt didn\u2019t used to be like this with Dad and me. We got along really well. It wasn\u2019t easy when Mom left, but we managed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your parents are divorced?\u201d Although she didn\u2019t mean to pry, she was definitely curious.</p><p>Mackenzie wrinkled her nose. \u201cIt was awful when they split.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt always is. My parents divorced when I was just a kid. I barely remember my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see him very much afterward?\u201d</p><p>Carrie shook her head. It had bothered her when she was younger, but she\u2019d made her peace with it as an adult. She\u2019d felt hurt that her father didn\u2019t want to be part of her life, but ultimately she\u2019d decided that was his choice\u2014and his loss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m spending Christmas with my mom and her new husband.\u201d Mackenzie\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen her in almost a year. She\u2019s been busy,\u201d she said. \u201cMom works for one of the big banks in downtown Seattle and she\u2019s got this really important position and has to travel and it\u2019s hard for her to have me over. Dad\u2019s a systems analyst.\u201d</p><p>Carrie heard the pain in Mackenzie\u2019s voice. \u201cYou\u2019re fifteen?\u201d she asked, deliberately adding a couple of years to her estimate, remembering how important it was to look older when one was that age.</p><p>Mackenzie straightened. \u201cThirteen, actually.\u201d</p><p>Carrie opened a bag of fat-free, cheese-flavored rice cakes and dumped them onto a plate. Mackenzie helped herself to one and Carrie did, as well. They sat across from each other on opposite sides of the kitchen counter.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think?\u201d Mackenzie said, her dark eyes intense. \u201cMy dad needs a woman.\u201d</p><p>The rice cake stuck midway down Carrie\u2019s throat. \u201cA.....woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a wife. All he does is work, work, work. It\u2019s like he can forget about my mother if he stays at the office long enough.\u201d She grabbed another rice cake. \u201cMadame Frederick said so, too. And she says he\u2019s going to meet someone, but she couldn\u2019t be any more specific than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadame Frederick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe looked into her crystal ball for me and said she saw lots of changes in my future. I wasn\u2019t too happy\u2014except for the part about my dad. There\u2019ve been too many changes already with the move and all. I miss my friends and it\u2019s taking way longer to build the new house than it was supposed to. Originally we were going to be in for Christmas, but now I doubt it\u2019ll be ready before next Thanksgiving. Dad doesn\u2019t seem to mind, but it bugs me. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s going to a strange school and everything.\u201d She frowned, shaking her head. \u201cI want my life back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s understandable.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie seemed caught up in a fantasy world of her own. \u201cYou know, I think Madame Frederick might\u2019ve stumbled on something here.\u201d Her voice rose with enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cStumbled on something?\u201d Carrie repeated cautiously.</p><p>\u201cYou know, about a relationship for my dad. I wonder how I could arrange that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinding a new wife for my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMackenzie,\u201d Carrie said and laughed nervously. \u201cA daughter can\u2019t arrange that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d She seemed taken aback.</p><p>\u201cWell, because marriage is serious. It\u2019s love and commitment between two people. It\u2019s.....it\u2019s.....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe perfect solution,\u201d Mackenzie finished for her. \u201cDad and I\u2019ve always liked the same things. We\u2019ve always agreed on everything.....well, until recently. It makes sense that I should be the one to find him a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMackenzie.....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d she said, without a pause. \u201cThat my dad won\u2019t appreciate my efforts, and you\u2019re probably right. I\u2019ll have to be subtle.\u201d</p><p>Carrie laughed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this,\u201d she whispered. This girl was like a reincarnation of herself eleven years earlier.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mackenzie demanded, apparently offended.</p><p>\u201cTake my advice and stay out of your father\u2019s love life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove life?\u201d she echoed. \u201cThat\u2019s a joke. He hasn\u2019t got one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want your help,\u201d Carrie said firmly.</p><p>\u201cOf course he doesn\u2019t, but that\u2019s beside the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMackenzie, if you\u2019re not getting along with your dad now, I hate to think what\u2019ll happen when he discovers what you\u2019re up to. My mother was furious with me when I offered Jason money to take her out and\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou were willing to pay someone to date your mother?\u201d</p><p>Carrie didn\u2019t realize what she\u2019d said until it was too late. \u201cIt was a long time ago,\u201d she murmured, hoping to leave it at that. She should\u2019ve known better. Mackenzie\u2019s eyes grew huge.</p><p>\u201cYou actually paid someone to date your mother?\u201d she said again.</p><p>\u201cYes, but don\u2019t get any ideas. He refused.\u201d Carrie could see the wheels turning in the girl\u2019s head. \u201cIt was a bad idea, and like I said, my mother was really mad at me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid she ever remarry?\u201d</p><p>Carrie nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnyone you knew?\u201d</p><p>Again she nodded, unwilling to tell her it was the very man she\u2019d tried to bribe.</p><p>Mackenzie\u2019s gaze met hers and Carrie looked away. \u201cIt was him, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but I didn\u2019t have anything to do with that.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie laughed. \u201cYou offered him money to date your mother. He refused, but dated her anyway. That\u2019s great! How long before they got married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMackenzie, what happened with my mother and Jason is.....unusual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d she repeated stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cA few months.\u201d</p><p>She smiled knowingly. \u201cThey\u2019re happy, aren\u2019t they.\u201d It was more of a comment than a question.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Carrie only hoped she\u2019d find a man who\u2019d make her as truly contented as Jason Manning had made her mother. Despite ten years of marriage and two children, her mother and stepfather behaved like newlyweds. Carrie marveled at the strength of their love. It inspired her and yet in some ways hampered her. She wanted that kind of relationship for herself and wasn\u2019t willing to settle for anything less. Her friends claimed she was too picky, too demanding when it came to men, and she suspected they were right.</p><p>\u201cMy point exactly,\u201d Mackenzie declared triumphantly. \u201cYou knew your mom better than anyone. Who else was more qualified to choose a husband for her? It\u2019s the same with me. I know my dad and he\u2019s in a rut. Something\u2019s got to be done, and Madame Frederick hit the nail on the head. He needs a love interest.\u201d</p><p>Carrie\u2019s smile was forced. \u201cMadame Frederick is one of my favorite people, but I think it\u2019s best to take what she says with a grain of salt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, a little salt enhances the flavor, right?\u201d Mackenzie added. Excited now, she got to her feet. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you. Would you be willing to date my dad?\u201d</p><p>Two</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s pretty, isn\u2019t she, Dad?\u201d</p><p>Philip Lark glanced up. He sat at the kitchen table, filling out an expense report. His daughter sat across from him, smiling warmly. The way her eyes focused on him told him she was up to something.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d he asked, wondering if it was wise to inquire.</p><p>\u201cCarrie Weston.\u201d At his blank look, she elaborated. \u201cThe woman we met in the elevator. We talked this afternoon.\u201d Mackenzie rested her chin in her hands and continued to gaze at him adoringly.</p><p>Philip\u2019s eyes reverted to the row of figures on the single sheet. His daughter waited patiently until he was finished. Patience wasn\u2019t a trait he was accustomed to seeing in Mackenzie. She usually complained when he brought work home, acting as though it was a personal affront. He cleared his mind, attempting to remember her question. Oh, yes, she wanted to know what he thought of Carrie Weston. For the life of him, he couldn\u2019t remember what the woman looked like. His impression of her remained vague, but he hadn\u2019t found anything to object to.</p><p>\u201cYou like her, do you?\u201d he asked instead, although he wasn\u2019t convinced that pandering to Mackenzie\u2019s moods was a smart thing to do. She\u2019d been impossible lately. Moody and unreasonable. Okay, okay, he realized the move had been hard on her; it hadn\u2019t been all that easy on him, either. But they\u2019d be here for only six to eight weeks. He\u2019d assumed she was mature enough to handle the situation. Evidently, he\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>Mackenzie\u2019s moods weren\u2019t all he\u2019d miscalculated. Philip used to think they were close, but for the past few months she\u2019d been a constant source of frustration.</p><p>Overnight his sane, sensible daughter had turned into Sarah Bernhardt\u2014or, more appropriately, Sarah Heartburn! She hadn\u2019t whined this much since she was three. Frankly, Philip didn\u2019t understand it. Even her mother\u2019s defection hadn\u2019t caused this much drama.</p><p>\u201cCarrie\u2019s great, really great.\u201d</p><p>Philip was pleased Mackenzie had made a new friend, although he would have been more pleased if it was someone closer to her own age. Still, as he kept reminding her, the situation was temporary. Gene Tarkington, a friend of his who owned this apartment building, had offered the furnished two-bedroom rental to him for as long as it\u2019d take to complete construction on his Lake Washington house. The apartment wasn\u2019t the Ritz, but he hadn\u2019t been expecting any luxury digs. Nor, truth be told, had he expected the cavalcade of characters who populated the building, although the woman with the crystal ball looked fairly harmless. And the muscle-bound sixty-year-old who walked around shirtless, carrying hand weights, appeared innocuous, too. He wasn\u2019t as certain about some of the others, but then he didn\u2019t plan on sticking around long enough to form friendships with this group of oddballs.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Mackenzie began in a wistful voice, \u201chave you ever thought of remarrying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered emphatically, shocked by the question. He\u2019d made one mistake; he wasn\u2019t willing to risk another. Laura and the twelve years they were together had taught him everything he cared to know about marriage.</p><p>\u201cYou sound mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d he said, thrusting the expense report back inside his briefcase, \u201cjust determined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of Mom, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I want to remarry?\u201d he asked, hoping to put an end to this conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou might want a son someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I want a son when I have you?\u201d</p><p>She grinned broadly, obviously approving his response. \u201cMadame Frederick looked into her crystal ball and said she sees another woman in your life.\u201d</p><p>Philip laughed at the sheer ridiculousness of that. Remarry? Him? He\u2019d rather dine on crushed glass. Wade through an alligator-infested swamp. Or jump off the Space Needle. No, he wasn\u2019t interested in remarrying. Not him. Not in this lifetime.</p><p>\u201cCarrie\u2019s a lot like me.\u201d</p><p>So this was what the conversation was all about. Carrie and him. Well, he\u2019d put a stop to that right now. \u201cHey.\u201d He raised his hand, palm out. \u201cI guess I\u2019m a little slow on the uptake here, but the fog is beginning to lift. You\u2019re playing matchmaker with me and this\u2014\u201d person he couldn\u2019t recall a single thing about \u201c\u2014neighbor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoman, Dad. Carrie\u2019s young, attractive, smart and funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is?\u201d He hadn\u2019t noticed that earlier, but then how could he? They\u2019d met for about a minute in the elevator.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s perfect for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says?\u201d As soon as the words left his lips, Philip knew he\u2019d made a strategic error. He\u2019d all but invited an argument.</p><p>Mackenzie\u2019s smile blossomed like a rose in the sun. \u201cMadame Frederick, for one. Me for another. Just think about it, Dad. You\u2019re in the prime of your life and all you do is work. You should be enjoying the fruit of your labors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m building the house,\u201d he said, wondering where she\u2019d heard that expression.</p><p>\u201cSure, to impress Mom, just so she\u2019ll know what a mistake she made leaving you.\u201d</p><p>His daughter\u2019s words brought him up short. Philip sincerely hoped that wasn\u2019t true. He wanted a new home for plenty of reasons, none of which included his ex-wife. Or so he believed.</p><p>\u201cWhy would your mother care about a home I\u2019m building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a knowing look, one tempered with gentle understanding, which only irritated him further. \u201cLet\u2019s leave Laura out of this, all right?\u201d His feelings for Mackenzie\u2019s mother were long dead. He\u2019d tried to make the marriage work, as God was his witness. Even when he discovered she was having an affair\u2014the first time\u2014he\u2019d been willing to do whatever was necessary to get them back on track. It\u2019d worked for a few years, but for the most part he\u2019d been deluding himself.</p><p>The divorce had come well after there was any marriage left to save. He\u2019d berated himself for a long time before, and since. He had his daughter and his dignity, and was grateful for both. The last thing he intended to do at this point was risk that hard-won serenity.</p><p>\u201cI want you to ask Carrie out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He couldn\u2019t believe her nerve. \u201cMackenzie, for heaven\u2019s sake, would you stop? I\u2019m not dating Carrie Westchester or anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Carrie Weston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer, either.\u201d He stalked into the kitchen and poured himself a cup of coffee. He took one sip, cringed at the bitter taste and dumped the rest in the sink.</p><p>\u201cPlease? She\u2019s in Apartment 204.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Case closed! I don\u2019t want to hear another word about this, understand?\u201d He must have added just enough authority to his voice because she didn\u2019t pursue the subject again. Philip was grateful.</p><p>The next time he glanced at his daughter, he saw her sitting in the middle of the living room, her arms folded tightly around her. The sour look on her face could have curdled cream.</p><p>\u201cSay, why don\u2019t we go out and buy a Christmas tree?\u201d he suggested. Despite what Mackenzie might think, he didn\u2019t enjoy fighting with her.</p><p>She turned to stare at him disdainfully and consider his proposal. With what seemed to require an extraordinary amount of effort, she said, \u201cNo thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, if that\u2019s the way you want to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said a Christmas tree would be too much trouble this year.\u201d</p><p>It would be, but he was willing to overlook that if it\u2019d take his daughter\u2019s mind off her present topic of interest. \u201cWe could put up a small one.\u201d He figured a compromise would go a long distance toward keeping the peace.</p><p>\u201cShe likes you,\u201d Mackenzie said with a righteous nod.</p><p>Philip didn\u2019t need to ask who she was talking about. He pressed his lips together to keep from saying something he\u2019d later regret. Such as.....how did this Carrie person know enough about him to either like or dislike him?</p><p>\u201cShe told me what happened to her when she was about my age,\u201d Mackenzie continued undaunted. \u201cHer parents divorced when she was around five and her mother didn\u2019t date again or anything. She closed herself off from new relationships, just the way you\u2019re doing, so Carrie felt she had to take matters into her own hands. And who could blame her? Not me, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d She paused long enough to draw in a breath. \u201cBy the time Carrie was a teenager, her mother had shriveled into this miserable, unhappy shrew.\u201d She stared pointedly at him before saying, \u201cSort of like what\u2019s happening to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome on now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she went on, ignoring his outburst, \u201cCarrie felt she had to do something. She offered to pay this guy to date her mother. Out of her own meager savings from babysitting jobs and walking the neighbor\u2019s dog. She took everything she\u2019d managed to scrape together to pay this man. She told me she would\u2019ve done anything to give her love-starved mother a second chance at happiness.\u201d</p><p>Philip restrained himself from rolling his eyes at her melodramatic rendition. All she needed was a violin playing softly in the background. \u201cHow noble of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the end of the story,\u201d Mackenzie informed him.</p> <p>\u201cYou mean there\u2019s more?\u201d</p><p>She paid no attention to his sarcasm. \u201cWhen her mother found out what she\u2019d done, she was furious with Carrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can well imagine.\u201d Philip crossed his arms and leaned against the doorjamb. He glanced at his watch, indicating that there was only so much of this he was willing to listen to and he was already close to his limit.</p><p>\u201cBut she withstood her mother\u2019s outrage. Knowing she was right, Carrie gladly accepted the two-week restriction her mother placed on her.\u201d</p><p>The strains of the violin grew distinctly louder.</p> <p>\u201cCarrie didn\u2019t pick just any Tom, Dick or Harry for her mother, though. She carefully, thoughtfully surveyed the eligible men around her and chose this really cool guy named James.....or something like that. His name isn\u2019t important\u2014what is important is that Carrie knew her mother well enough to choose the perfect man for her. She chose the very best.\u201d</p><p>Now his daughter was beginning to sound like a greeting-card commercial. \u201cThis story does have a point, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Her eyes gleamed with triumph. \u201cNot more than three months later, four at the most, Carrie\u2019s mother married Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said his name was James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also said his name doesn\u2019t matter. The point is that he married her and they\u2019re both happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must have cost her a pretty penny, since Carrie had already paid him everything she\u2019d saved just for that first date.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe married her for free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see, she was on sale.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie frowned at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not funny. Carrie told me that meeting Jason was the best thing that ever happened to her mother. Once a year, on the anniversary of their first date, her mom sends her flowers out of gratitude that her daughter, the very one she\u2019d restricted for two whole weeks, had cared enough to find the man of her dreams.\u201d</p><p>As her voice rose victoriously, the violin faded and was replaced with a full choral arrangement of God Bless America. Philip could just about hear it. His daughter was Sarah Heartburn during her finest hour.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she said, \u201cwill you ask Carrie out? She\u2019s perfect for you, Dad. I know what you like and what you don\u2019t, and you\u2019re gonna like her. She\u2019s really nice and fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He yawned loudly, covering his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never said anything, but I\u2019d really love to be a big sister, the way Carrie is to her two half brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but no thanks.\u201d The kid was actually beginning to frighten him. Not only was she telling him he should date a woman he\u2019d barely met, now she was talking about them having children together.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it because I asked it of you. Do it for yourself. Do it before your heart turns into a hardened shell and you shrivel up into an old man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not dead yet. I\u2019ve got a good forty or fifty years left in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Mackenzie challenged. \u201cIf you\u2019re lucky.\u201d With her nose pointed at the ceiling she exited the room with all the flair and drama of an actress walking offstage after the final curtain call.</p><p>Grinning to himself, Philip opened his briefcase. He removed a file, then hesitated, frowning. It was one thing to have his daughter carry on like a Shakespearean actress and another for an adult woman to be feeding her this nonsense. While he couldn\u2019t remember much about Ms. Carrie Weston, he did recall that she\u2019d appeared interested in him, judging by the intent way she\u2019d studied him. Perhaps he\u2019d better set the record straight with her. If she intended to use his daughter to get to him, then she was about to learn a thing or two.</p><p>He slammed his briefcase shut and marched toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Mackenzie asked, returning\u2014of course\u2014at that very instant.</p><p>\u201cTo talk to your friend,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cYou mean Carrie?\u201d she asked excitedly. \u201cYou won\u2019t be sorry, Dad, I promise you. She\u2019s really nice and I know you\u2019ll like her. If you haven\u2019t decided where to take her to dinner, I\u2019d suggest Henry\u2019s, off Broadway. You took me there for my birthday, remember?\u201d</p><p>Philip didn\u2019t bother to inform his daughter that inviting Carrie to dinner wasn\u2019t exactly what he had in mind. He walked out the door and nearly collided with the old biddy clutching the crystal ball.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Mr. Lark,\u201d Madame Frederick greeted him with a tranquil smile. She glanced at him and then at the crystal ball and her smile grew wider.</p><p>\u201cKeep that thing away from me,\u201d he told her in clear tones. \u201cI don\u2019t want you doing any of that hocus-pocus around my daughter. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d she said with great dignity and moved past him. Philip glared at her, then sighed, exasperated. He headed for the stairs, running down to the second floor.</p><p>When he reached Carrie Weston\u2019s apartment, he was winded and short-tempered. She answered his knock almost immediately.</p><p>\u201cMr. Lark.\u201d Her eyes widened with the appropriate amount of surprise, as though she\u2019d spent the past five minutes standing in front of a mirror practicing.</p><p>\u201cIt seems you and I need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cRight now.\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>Carrie Weston was lovely, Philip realized. For reasons he didn\u2019t want to analyze, he hadn\u2019t noticed how strikingly attractive she was when they\u2019d met in the elevator. Her eyes were clear blue, almost aquamarine. Intense. Her expression warm and open.</p><p>It took him a moment to recall why he\u2019d rushed down here to talk to her. Maybe, just maybe, what Mackenzie had been saying\u2014that he was shriveling up emotionally\u2014contained a grain of truth. The thought sobered him.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you about Mackenzie,\u201d he stammered out.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a delightful young lady. I hope I didn\u2019t keep her too long.\u201d Carrie\u2019s words were apologetic as she reached into the hallway closet for her coat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about your discussion with her this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t chat just now. I feed Maria\u2019s cats on Wednesdays and I\u2019m already late.\u201d</p><p>It could be a convenient excuse to escape him, but he was determined to see this through. \u201cDo you mind if I tag along?\u201d</p><p>She looked mildly surprised, but agreed. \u201cSure, if you want.\u201d She picked up a ten-pound bag of cat food. Ten pounds? Philip knew the older woman kept a ridiculous number of animals. Gene had complained to him more than once, but the retired schoolteacher had lived in the building for fifteen years and paid her rent on time. Gene tolerated her tendency to adopt cats, but he didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to get your coat,\u201d she suggested as she locked her apartment.</p><p>\u201cMy coat?\u201d She seemed to imply that the old lady kept her apartment at subzero temperatures. \u201cAll right,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She waited as he hurried up the stairs. Mackenzie leaped to her feet the second he walked in the door. \u201cWhat\u2019d you say to her?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cNothing yet.\u201d He yanked his coat off the hanger. \u201cI\u2019m helping her feed some cats.\u201d</p><p>The worry left his daughter\u2019s eyes. \u201cReally? That\u2019s almost a date, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think.\u201d He jerked his arms into the jacket sleeves.</p><p>\u201cShe asked me if I wanted to bake Christmas cookies with her and her two brothers on Saturday. I can, can\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about that later.\u201d Carrie Weston was wheedling her way into his daughter\u2019s life. He didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>Mackenzie didn\u2019t look pleased but gave a quick nod. Her worried expression returned as he walked out the door.</p><p>Philip wasn\u2019t sure why he\u2019d decided to join Carrie. He needed to clarify the situation, but it wasn\u2019t necessary to follow her around with a bag of cat food to do so.</p><p>\u201cMaria has a special love for cats,\u201d Carrie explained as they entered the elevator and rode to the ground floor. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel it\u2019s a good idea for her to be going out alone at night to feed the strays.\u201d</p><p>So that was what this was all about\u2014feeding stray cats.</p><p>\u201cMaria calls them her homeless babies.\u201d</p><p>Philip sure hoped no one at the office heard about this. They stepped outside and his breath formed a small cloud. \u201cHow often does she do this?\u201d he asked, walking beside Carrie.</p><p>\u201cEvery day,\u201d she answered. Half a block later she turned into an almost-dark alley. Carrie had said she didn\u2019t think it was safe for Maria to venture out alone at night. Philip wasn\u2019t convinced it was any less risky for her. He glanced about and saw nothing but a row of green Dumpsters.</p><p>They were halfway down the dimly lit alley when he heard the welcoming meow of cats. Carrie removed a cardboard container from a Dumpster and left a large portion of food there. The cats eagerly raced toward it. One tabby wove his way around her feet, his tail slithering about Carrie\u2019s slender calf. Squatting down, she ran her gloved hand down the back side of a large male. \u201cThis is Brutus,\u201d she said, \u201cJim Dandy, Button Nose, Falcon and Queen Bee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou named them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me, Maria. They\u2019re her friends. Most have been on their own so long that they\u2019re unable to adapt to any other way of life. Maria\u2019s paid to have them neutered, and she nursed Brutus back to health after he lost an eye in a fight. He was nearly dead when she found him. He let her look after him, but domesticated living wasn\u2019t for Brutus. Actually, I think he\u2019s the one that got Maria started on the care and feeding of the strays. I help out once a week. Arnold and a couple of the others do, too. And we all contribute what we can to the costs of cat food and vet care.\u201d</p><p>All this talk about cats was fine, but Philip had other things on his mind. \u201cAs I explained earlier, I wanted to talk to you about Mackenzie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Carrie gave each of the cats a gentle touch, straightened and started out of the alley.</p><p>\u201cShe came back from her visit with you spouting some ridiculous idea about the two of us dating,\u201d Philip continued.</p><p>Carrie had the good grace to blush, he noted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m the one who inadvertently put that idea in her head. Mr. Lark, I can\u2019t tell you how embarrassed I am about this. It all started with an innocent conversation about parents. My parents got divorced, as well\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen you were four or five, as I recall,\u201d he said. He hated to admit it, but he enjoyed her uneasiness. Knowing Mackenzie, he was well aware of the finesse with which his daughter manipulated conversations. Poor Carrie hadn\u2019t had a chance. \u201cMackenzie also said you paid a man to date your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear.\u201d She closed her eyes. \u201cNo wonder you wanted to talk to me.\u201d She glanced guiltily in his direction. \u201cJason was far too honorable to accept my offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he did as you asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.....Listen, I do apologize. I\u2019d better have another talk with Mackenzie. I\u2019ll try to set the record straight. I was afraid she might do something like this. Actually, I should\u2019ve realized her intent and warned you. But I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d race right upstairs and repeat every word of our conversation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy daughter has a mind of her own. And she\u2019s taken quite a liking to you.\u201d For that, Philip was grateful. Mackenzie needed a positive female role model. Heaven knew her mother had shown little enough interest in her only child. Philip could do nothing to ease the pain of that, and it hurt him to hear Mackenzie make excuses for Laura\u2019s indifference.</p><p>As they chatted, Carrie led him into a nearby vacant lot. He learned quite a bit about her in those few minutes. She worked for Microsoft, had lots of family in the area and doted on her two half brothers.</p><p>The minute they stepped onto the lot, ten or so stray cats eased out of the shadows. They\u2019d obviously been waiting for Carrie. Talking softly, issuing reassurances and comfort, she distributed the food in a series of aluminum pie plates situated about the area.</p><p>\u201cI saw a lot of my teenage self in Mackenzie,\u201d she said when she rejoined him. She looked at him, but didn\u2019t hold his gaze long. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the fact that my parents were divorced\u2014broken homes were prevalent enough\u2014but I\u2019d been cheated out of more than the ideal family. In some ways I didn\u2019t have a mother, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to say I\u2019m not a good father?\u201d he asked tightly.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d she said automatically. \u201cI think I should keep my mouth shut. I do apologize for what happened with Mackenzie. Don\u2019t worry, Mr. Lark, I have no intention of using your daughter to orchestrate a date with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still want her to come over to bake cookies?\u201d he asked. He\u2019d be in trouble with Mackenzie if she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you and I are straight about where we stand with each other. I\u2019m not interested in a relationship with you. It\u2019s nothing personal. You\u2019re young and attractive and will make some man very happy one day\u2014it just won\u2019t be me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t.....You\u2019re not\u2014\u201d She stopped abruptly and glared up at him. \u201cRest assured, Mr. Lark, you have nothing to fear from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. As long as we understand each other.\u201d</p> <p>Carrie removed her gloves and viciously shoved them into her pockets. She hung her coat in the closet and sat down, crossing her arms and her legs. She uncrossed both just as quickly, stood and started pacing. She couldn\u2019t keep still.</p><p>Philip Lark actually believed she\u2019d tried to use his daughter to arrange a date with him! Talk about an egomaniac! This guy took the prize as the most conceited, egotistical, vain man she\u2019d ever had the displeasure of meeting. She wouldn\u2019t date him now if he were the last man on the face of the earth.</p><p>The phone rang and she frowned at it, then realized she was being ridiculous and picked up the receiver.</p><p>\u201cCarrie?\u201d Her name was whispered.</p><p>It was her stepfather, Jason Manning. \u201cYes?\u201d she answered. \u201cIs there a reason you\u2019re whispering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your mother to hear me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Despite her agitation with Philip Lark she grinned.</p><p>\u201cI ordered Charlotte a Christmas gift this afternoon,\u201d he boasted. From years past, Carrie knew buying gifts didn\u2019t come naturally to Jason, since he\u2019d been a confirmed bachelor until he met her mother. The first Christmas after they were married he\u2019d bought Charlotte a bowling ball, season tickets to the Seattle Seahawks and a vacuum cleaner. After that, Carrie had steered him toward more personal things.</p> <p>\u201cYou know how your mother likes to go to garage sales?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not likely to forget.\u201d Jason had given her mother a lot of grief over her penchant to shop at yard sales. He liked to joke that Charlotte had found priceless pieces of Tupperware in her search for treasure.</p><p>\u201cWell, a friend of mine started a limousine service and I hired him to escort your mother to yard sales on the Saturday of her choice. What do you think?\u201d His voice rose in excitement. \u201cShe\u2019ll love it, won\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will.\u201d Carrie couldn\u2019t keep from smiling. \u201cShe\u2019ll have the time of her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so,\u201d he said proudly. \u201cJeff\u2019s giving me a twenty-percent discount, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also think it\u2019s really sweet that you\u2019re taking Mom Christmas shopping in downtown Seattle on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, that\u2019s the price a man pays to please his wife.\u201d He didn\u2019t sound very enthusiastic.</p><p>\u201cDoug and Dillon are coming to stay with me. We\u2019re baking cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m voluntarily going Christmas shopping. There isn\u2019t another person in the world who could drag me into the city during the busiest shopping season of the year. Your mother\u2019s got to know I love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does know.\u201d Carrie had never doubted it, not from the first moment she\u2019d seen her mother and Jason together. Rarely had any two people been more right for each other. While Jason might not be the most romantic man alive\u2014she smiled whenever she recalled the look on her mother\u2019s face when she unwrapped that bowling ball\u2014he was a devoted husband and father.</p><p>Jason Manning loved and nurtured Carrie as if she\u2019d been his own child. A teenager couldn\u2019t have asked for a better stepdad. After some of the horror stories she\u2019d heard from other girls in her situation, she appreciated him even more.</p><p>She heard a persistent pounding. \u201cThere\u2019s someone at my door,\u201d she told Jason.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you go, then,\u201d he said. \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t say anything to your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lips are sealed.\u201d A limo to escort her to garage sales! Carrie smiled. She replaced the receiver and hurried across the living room to answer the door. It\u2019d been a long day and a busy evening; she was hungry, tired and in no mood for company.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Mackenzie said, her eyes wide. \u201cSo how\u2019d it go with my dad?\u201d</p><p>Carrie frowned.</p><p>\u201cThat bad, huh?\u201d The girl laughed lightly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll get better once he gets used to the idea of dating again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMackenzie, listen, you and I need to talk about this. Your father\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I can\u2019t talk now. Dad doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m gone, but I just wanted to say don\u2019t be discouraged. All he needs is time.\u201d She beamed her another wide smile. \u201cThis is going to be so great! Wait until Jane hears about how I found my dad a wife. Jane\u2019s my best friend. I\u2019ll see you Saturday.\u201d Having said that, she promptly disappeared.</p><p>Carrie closed the door and shut her eyes, feeling mildly guilty at what she\u2019d started.</p><p>There was an abrupt knock at the door.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d she demanded, her patience gone.</p><p>Madame Frederick smiled back at her. Arnold, muscles bulging in his upper arms, stood beside her. Both regarded her with open curiosity.</p><p>\u201cHas she met him yet?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cHas she met the man of her dreams\u2014and do you know who it is?\u201d</p><p>Madame Frederick\u2019s face glowed. \u201cYou can see for yourself.\u201d She lifted her crystal ball and ran her hand over the smooth glass surface. \u201cOne look should tell you.\u201d</p><p>But Carrie couldn\u2019t see anything at all.</p><p>Four</p><p>A thin layer of flour dusted her small kitchen. Carrie fanned her hand in front of her face in an effort to clear the air. The scent of baking gingerbread men drifted through the apartment, smelling of spices and fun.</p><p>Dillon stood on a chair, leaning over the electric mixer, watching intently as it stirred the cookie dough. Doug was at the counter, his sleeves up past his elbows, a rolling pin in his hand. Mackenzie used a spatula to scoop the freshly baked cookies from the baking sheet and placed them on the wire rack to cool.</p><p>\u201cDo you think anyone will taste the eggshell?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe recipe said two eggs,\u201d Dillon muttered defensively, \u201cand Carrie said the whole egg. How was I supposed to know she didn\u2019t mean the shell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just should,\u201d his older brother informed him with more than a hint of righteousness.</p><p>\u201cI already said we don\u2019t need to worry about it,\u201d Carrie inserted, hoping to soothe Dillon\u2019s dented ego. She\u2019d gotten most of the shell out and the remainder had been pulverized to the point that it was no longer distinguishable.</p><p>Mackenzie rolled her eyes expressively, but it was clear she was enjoying herself. More and more she reminded Carrie of herself eleven years earlier. She\u2019d taken to Doug and Dillon immediately and they were equally enthralled with her. Within an hour they were the best of friends.</p><p>\u201cI want to decorate the cookies, too,\u201d Dillon cried, when he saw that Carrie had finished making the frosting.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t lick the knife,\u201d his older brother remarked snidely. \u201cNot when we\u2019re giving the cookies to other people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be plenty of frosting for everyone,\u201d Carrie reassured them.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going to taste the first gingerbread man?\u201d</p><p>The three kids looked at one another. \u201cDillon should,\u201d Doug said.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Her youngest brother squared his shoulders bravely. \u201cI don\u2019t mind. Besides, Carrie said no one would be able to taste the eggshell, anyway.\u201d He climbed off the chair and reached for a cookie. \u201cMaybe you should put a little frosting on, just in case,\u201d he said to Carrie.</p><p>She slathered some across the cookie and handed it back to him. Dillon closed his eyes and opened his mouth while the others waited for the outcome. One bite quickly became another.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should eat two just to make sure,\u201d the six-year-old told her.</p><p>Carrie winked and handed her youngest brother a second cookie, also slathered with frosting.</p><p>\u201cI better try some, too,\u201d Doug said and grabbed one. He gobbled it up, head first, then nodded. \u201cNot bad,\u201d he mumbled, his mouth full of cookie. \u201cEven without the frosting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re saving some for us, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Dillon asked, reaching across the counter for the frosting knife.</p><p>\u201cOf course, but I promised a plate to Arnold, Maria and Madame Frederick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I frost now?\u201d Dillon asked, pulling the chair closer to the counter where Carrie stood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want to decorate, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Mackenzie chimed in.</p><p>An hour later, Carrie was exhausted. Doug and Dillon finished drying the last of the dishes and threw themselves in front of the television to watch their favorite DVD. Carrie sat on a bar stool, her energy gone, while Mackenzie painstakingly added tiny red cinnamon candies to the cookie faces.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s late,\u201d she said with a knowing sigh as she formed a pair of candy lips, \u201cbut then he\u2019s always longer than he says he\u2019s going to be. He has no life, you know.\u201d She glanced up from her task to be sure Carrie was paying attention.</p> <p>\u201cWe agreed,\u201d Carrie reminded the girl, wagging her index finger.</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d Carrie had insisted Mackenzie keep Philip Lark out of the conversation. It seemed drastic, but was necessary, otherwise Mackenzie would use every opportunity to talk about her poor, lonely father, so desperate for female companionship that he was practically shriveling up before her eyes. Carrie could repeat the entire speech, verbatim.</p><p>It had taken the better part of two days to convince the girl that Carrie wasn\u2019t romantically interested in Philip, no matter how perfectly matched they appeared to be in Mackenzie\u2019s estimation.</p><p>Carrie suspected that Mackenzie was hearing much the same thing from her father. Philip wasn\u2019t thrilled with the idea of his daughter playing matchmaker any more than she was. In the three days since their first meeting, they\u2019d made an effort to avoid seeing or talking to each other. The last thing Mackenzie needed was evidence that her plan was working.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a real shame,\u201d Mackenzie said, eyeing her carefully. \u201cMadame Frederick agrees with me and so do Arnold and Maria.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Carrie said, loudly enough to draw the boys\u2019 attention away from the TV screen.</p><p>When Mackenzie had finished decorating the last of the cookies, Carrie set them on three plastic plates, covered each with clear wrap and stuck a bright, frilly bow to the top.</p><p>\u201cI want to deliver Arnold\u2019s,\u201d Doug told her. The oldest of her brothers had developed an interest in the former weight lifter. Arnold fit the stereotype. From his shiny bald head to his handlebar mustache and bulging muscles, everything about him said circus performer. Sometimes, as a concession to holidays or other special occasions, he even wore red spandex shorts over his blue tights. Doug was entranced.</p><p>\u201cWill Maria let me pet her cats?\u201d Dillon wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cOf course she will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that leaves me with Madame Frederick,\u201d Mackenzie said, not sounding disappointed. She cast a look toward the kitchen and Carrie guessed she wanted to make sure there\u2019d be enough cookies left to take home to her father. Carrie had already made up a plate for the Larks, and told her so.</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Mackenzie said, her eyes glowing.</p><p>All three disappeared, eager to deliver their gifts, and Carrie collapsed on the sofa. She rested her head against the cushion and closed her eyes, enjoying the peace and quiet. It didn\u2019t last long.</p><p>Doug barreled back in moments later, followed by Mackenzie. Dillon trailed behind.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in here,\u201d Carrie heard her brother explain as he entered her apartment. Philip walked with him.</p><p>Carrie was immediately aware of how she must look. Flour had dusted more than the kitchen counters. She hadn\u2019t bothered with makeup that morning and had worn her grungiest jeans. She\u2019d hardly ever felt more self-conscious in front of a man. She probably resembled a snowman\u2014snow woman\u2014only not so well dressed.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d Mackenzie cried, delighted to see him.</p><p>Carrie stood and quickly removed the apron, certain the domestic look distracted from any slight air of sophistication she might still possess. Perhaps it was her imagination, but it seemed Philip\u2019s gaze zeroed in on her.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve knocked,\u201d he said, and motioned to Dillon, \u201cbut your friend here insisted I come right in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s fine.\u201d Each word seemed to stick to the roof of her mouth like paste. She clasped her hands together, remembering how uneasy her mother had been around Jason those first few times. Carrie had never understood that. Jason was the easiest person in the world to talk to.</p><p>Now she understood.</p><p>\u201cMackenzie behaved herself?\u201d Once again the question was directed to Carrie.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d Mackenzie burst out. \u201cWay to embarrass me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a big help,\u201d Carrie assured him.</p><p>\u201cMom didn\u2019t call, did she?\u201d Mackenzie advanced one step toward her father, her eyes hopeful.</p><p>Philip shook his head, and Carrie watched as disappointment settled over the girl. \u201cShe\u2019s really busy this time of year,\u201d Mackenzie explained to no one in particular. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised she didn\u2019t call, not with so much else on her mind.....and everything.\u201d</p><p>Carrie resisted the urge to place her arm around Mackenzie\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cHow about a movie?\u201d Philip suggested abruptly. \u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time we went together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Mackenzie jerked her head up.</p><p>\u201cSure. Any one you want.\u201d</p><p>She mentioned the current Disney picture. \u201cCan Doug and Dillon come, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Philip smiled affectionately at his daughter.</p><p>\u201cAnd Carrie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI.....couldn\u2019t,\u201d she interjected before Philip could respond.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Doug asked. \u201cYou said we\u2019re all done with the cookies. A movie would be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be welcome,\u201d Philip surprised her by adding. His eyes held hers and the offer appeared genuine. Apparently he felt that with three young chaperones, there wouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re positive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he is,\u201d Mackenzie said. \u201cMy father doesn\u2019t say things he doesn\u2019t mean, isn\u2019t that right, Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He sounded less confident this time.</p><p>Carrie was half tempted to let him take the kids on his own but changed her mind. Doug had a point; a movie would be a great way to relax after the hectic activity of the morning.</p><p>The five of them would be at the show together\u2014and what could be more innocent? But the moment they entered the theater and had purchased their popcorn, the three kids promptly found seats several rows away from Philip and Carrie.</p><p>\u201cBut I thought we\u2019d all sit together,\u201d Carrie said, loudly enough for Doug and Dillon to hear. Desperation echoed in her voice.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for little kids,\u201d six-year-old Dillon turned around to inform her.</p><p>With the theater filling up fast, the option of sitting together soon disappeared. Carrie settled uneasily next to Philip. Neither spoke. He didn\u2019t seem any happier about this than she was.</p><p>\u201cDo you want some popcorn?\u201d Philip offered, tilting the overflowing bucket in her direction.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d she whispered, and glanced at her watch, wondering how much longer it would be before the movie started. \u201cI certainly hope you don\u2019t think I arranged this,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cArranged what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe two of us sitting together.\u201d She\u2019d hate to have him accuse her of anything underhanded, which, given his apparent penchant for casting blame, he was likely to do. On the other hand, she was the one who\u2019d unwittingly put the matchmaking notion in Mackenzie\u2019s head. What a fool she\u2019d been not to realize the impressionable teenager would pick up on the ploy she\u2019d used on her own mother.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I blame you?\u201d he asked, sounding exasperated.</p><p>\u201cMight I remind you of our last conversation?\u201d she said stiffly. \u201cYou seemed to think there was some danger of me, uh, seducing you.\u201d</p><p>Philip laughed out loud and didn\u2019t look the least bit repentant. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t myself I was worried about,\u201d he explained. \u201cI was afraid of Mackenzie making both our lives miserable. If I seemed rude earlier, I apologize, but I was protecting us from the wiles of my headstrong daughter.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t how Carrie remembered it......</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to let my daughter do my courting for me,\u201d he said, as though that explained everything. \u201cNow relax and enjoy the movie.\u201d He tilted the popcorn her way again, and this time Carrie helped herself.</p><p>The theater lights dimmed as twenty minutes of previews began.</p><p>Somewhat to Carrie\u2019s surprise, she loved the movie, which was an animated feature. She was soon completely immersed in the plot. Philip laughed in all the places she did and whatever tension existed between them melted away with their shared enjoyment.</p><p>When the movie ended, Carrie was sorry there wasn\u2019t more. While it was true that she\u2019d enjoyed the story, she also found pleasure sitting with Philip. In fact, she liked him. She\u2019d almost prefer to find something objectionable about him\u2014a nervous habit, a personality trait she disliked, his attitude. Something. Anything that would distract from noticing how attractive he was.</p><p>He\u2019d made it as plain as possible that he wasn\u2019t interested in a relationship with her. With anyone, if that was any comfort. It wasn\u2019t. She wanted him to be cold and standoffish, brusque and businesslike. The side of him she\u2019d seen at the movie was laid-back and fun-loving. But she knew Philip hadn\u2019t developed a sudden desire to escort his daughter to the movies. He\u2019d offered because of Mackenzie\u2019s disappointment over her mother\u2019s lack of sensitivity. He loved his daughter and wanted to protect her from the pain only a selfish parent could inflict on a child.</p><p>\u201cThis was a nice thing you did,\u201d she said as they exited the theater. The kids raced on ahead of them toward the parking lot. \u201cIt helped take Mackenzie\u2019s mind off not hearing from her mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure it was a good idea,\u201d he muttered, dumping the empty popcorn container in the garbage can on their way out the door.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He turned and stared at her. \u201cBecause I find myself liking you.\u201d</p><p>Her reaction must have shone in her eyes, because his own narrowed fractionally. \u201cYou felt it, too, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She wanted to lie. But she couldn\u2019t. \u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not right for you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIn other words, I\u2019m wrong for you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her for a long time. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you, Carrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she answered brightly, \u201cI won\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Mackenzie proudly held up a crochet hook with a lopsided snowflake dangling from it. \u201cCarrie\u2019s whole tree is decorated with snowflakes she crocheted,\u201d she added. \u201cHer grandma Manning taught her to crochet when she was about my age.\u201d She wound the thread around her index finger and awkwardly manipulated the hook.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019ll be pleased, won\u2019t she.\u201d Mackenzie turned the question into a statement, so certain was she of his response.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be thrilled.\u201d Philip\u2019s jaw tightened at the mention of Laura. His ex-wife had contacted Mackenzie and arranged a time for their daughter to visit her. Ever since she\u2019d heard from her mother, Mackenzie had been walking five feet off the ground. Philip didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do if Laura didn\u2019t show. He wouldn\u2019t put it past her, but he prayed she wouldn\u2019t do anything so cruel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCarrie\u2019s been great,\u201d Mackenzie continued. \u201cShe taught me everything.\u201d She paused long enough to look up at him. \u201cI like her so much, Dad.\u201d</p><p>The hint was there and it wasn\u2019t subtle. The problem was that Philip had discovered that his feelings for Carrie were similar to those of his daughter. Although he avoided contact with Carrie, there was no escaping her. Mackenzie brought her name into every conversation, marching her virtues past him, one by one.</p><p>Carrie had become a real friend to Mackenzie. It used to be that his daughter moped about the apartment, complaining about missing her friends\u2014although she spent plenty of time on the phone and the Internet with them\u2014and generally making his life miserable. These days, if she wasn\u2019t with Carrie, she was helping Maria with her cats, having tea with Madame Frederick\u2014and having the leaves read\u2014or lifting weights with Arnold.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss the Christmas party,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cIt\u2019s in the community room on Christmas Eve.\u201d She glanced up to be certain he was listening. \u201cEveryone in the building\u2019s invited. Carrie\u2019s going, so is Madame Frederick and just everyone. It\u2019s going to be a blast.\u201d She sighed with heartfelt regret. \u201cBut being with Mom is more important than a party. She\u2019s really busy, you know,\u201d Mackenzie said, not for the first time.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she is,\u201d Philip muttered distractedly. He\u2019d forgotten about the Christmas party. He\u2019d received the notice a day or so earlier, and would\u2019ve tossed it if Mackenzie hadn\u2019t gone into ecstasies when she saw it. From her reaction, one would think it was an invitation to the Christmas ball to meet a bachelor prince. As for him, he had better things to do than spend the evening with a group of friendly oddballs\u2014and Carrie.</p><p>Philip reached for his car keys and his gym bag. \u201cI\u2019ll only be gone an hour,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019ll take me that long to finish this.\u201d She looked up. \u201cOh, I almost forgot,\u201d she said, putting everything aside and leaping out of the chair as if propelled upward by a loose spring. She ran into her bedroom and returned a moment later with a small white envelope. \u201cIt\u2019s for you,\u201d she said, watching him eagerly. \u201cOpen it now, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I wait until Christmas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She gestured for him to tear open the envelope.</p> <p>Inside was a card in the shape of a silver bell.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and read it,\u201d she urged, and would have done so herself if he hadn\u2019t acted promptly. The card was an invitation to lunch at the corner deli. \u201cI\u2019m buying,\u201d she insisted, \u201cto thank you for being a great dad. We\u2019ve had our differences this year and I want you to know that no matter what I say, I\u2019ll always love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel the same way, and I don\u2019t tell you that enough,\u201d he murmured, touched by her words. \u201cI\u2019ll be happy to pay for lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve saved my allowance and did a few odd jobs for Madame Frederick and Arnold. I can afford it, as long as you don\u2019t order the most expensive thing on the menu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll eat a big breakfast,\u201d he said and kissed her on the cheek before he walked out the door. He pushed the button for the elevator and caught himself grinning. He\u2019d been doing a lot more of that lately. In the beginning he thought moving into the apartment had been a mistake. No longer. The changes in Mackenzie since meeting Carrie had been dramatic.</p><p>The elevator arrived and he stepped inside, pushing the button for the lobby. It stopped on the next floor and Carrie entered, carrying a laundry basket. She hesitated when she saw he was the only other occupant.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t bite,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they all say,\u201d she teased back. She reached across him and pushed the button for the basement, then stepped back. The doors closed sluggishly. Finally the elevator started to move, its descent slow and methodical, then it lurched sharply, dropping several feet.</p><p>Carrie gasped and staggered against the wall.</p><p>Philip maintained his balance by bracing his shoulder against the side. Everything went dark.</p><p>\u201cPhilip?\u201d Carrie inquired a moment later.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d It was more than dark, it was pitch-black inside. Even straining his eyes, he couldn\u2019t see a thing. \u201cLooks like there\u2019s been a power outage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear.\u201d Her voice sounded small.</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid of the dark?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d she returned indignantly. \u201cWell, maybe just a little. Everyone is\u2014I mean, it wouldn\u2019t be unusual under these circumstances to experience some anxiety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he agreed politely, putting his gym bag down beside him.</p><p>\u201cHow long will it take for the power to come back on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He shrugged, although he realized she couldn\u2019t see him. \u201cGive me your hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cI thought it would comfort you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Here,\u201d she murmured, but of course he couldn\u2019t see it. He thrust his arm out and their hands collided. She gripped his like a lifeline tossed over the side of a boat. Her fingers were cold as ice.</p><p>\u201cHey, there\u2019s nothing to be afraid of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d she responded defensively.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t entirely sure who moved first, but before another moment passed, he had his arm around her and was holding her protectively against him. He\u2019d been thinking about this since the day they\u2019d attended the movie. He hadn\u2019t allowed himself to dwell on the image, but it felt right to have her this close. More right than it should.</p><p>Neither spoke. He wasn\u2019t sure why; then again, he knew. For his own part, he didn\u2019t want reality interrupting his fantasy. Under the cover of the dark he could safely lower his guard. Carrie, he suspected, didn\u2019t speak for fear she\u2019d reveal how truly frightened she was. Philip felt her tremble and welcomed the opportunity to bring her closer into his embrace.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>Without conscious thought, he wove his fingers into her hair. He loved the softness of it, the fresh, clean scent. He tried to concentrate on other things and found that he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should talk,\u201d she suggested. \u201cYou know, to help pass the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d He could feel her breath against the side of his neck. Wistful and provocative. In that instant Philip knew he was going to kiss her. He was motivated by two equally strong impulses\u2014need and curiosity. It\u2019d been a long time since he\u2019d held a woman. For longer than he wanted to remember, he\u2019d kept any hint of desire tightly in check. He\u2019d rather live a life of celibacy than risk another failed marriage.</p><p>He would\u2019ve ended their embrace then and there if Carrie had offered any resistance. She didn\u2019t. Her lips were moist and warm. Welcoming. He moaned softly and she did, too.</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted to talk,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d he promised and kissed her again.</p><p>At first their kisses were light, intriguing, seductive. This wouldn\u2019t be happening if they weren\u2019t trapped in a dark elevator, Philip assured himself. He felt he should explain that, but couldn\u2019t stop kissing her long enough to form the words.</p><p>\u201cPhilip.....\u201d</p><p>He responded by brushing his moist lips against hers. His gut wrenched with sheer excitement at what they were doing.</p><p>Carrie wrapped her arms around his neck, clinging tightly. He eased her against the wall, kissing her ravenously.</p><p>That was when the lights came back on.</p><p>They both froze. It was as if they stood on a stage behind a curtain that was about to be raised, revealing them to a waiting audience.</p><p>But the electricity flashed off as quickly as it had come on.</p><p>Philip plastered himself against the wall, his hands loose at his sides as he struggled to deal with what they\u2019d been doing. He wasn\u2019t a kid anymore, but he\u2019d behaved like one\u2014like a love-starved seventeen-year-old boy.</p><p>For the first time since his divorce, Philip felt the defenses around his heart begin to crack. The barriers had been fortified by his bitterness, by resentment, by fear. This\u2014falling in love with Carrie\u2014wasn\u2019t what he wanted. After the divorce, he\u2019d vowed not to get involved again. Carrie was young and sweet and deserved a man who came without emotional scars and a child in tow.</p><p>He was grateful that the electricity hadn\u2019t returned; he needed these few additional minutes to compose himself.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked, when he could speak without betraying what he felt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Her voice contradicted her words. She sounded anything but.</p><p>He thought of apologizing, but he couldn\u2019t make himself say the words, afraid she\u2019d guess the effect she\u2019d had on him.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame a guy for taking advantage of the dark, can you?\u201d he asked, callously and deliberately making light of the exchange.</p><p>The electricity returned at precisely that moment. He squinted against the bright light. Carrie stood with her back against the wall opposite him, her fingers fanned out against the panel, her eyes stricken. The laundry basket rested in the far corner where she\u2019d dropped it, clothing tumbled all around.</p><p>\u201cIs that all this was to you?\u201d she asked in a hurt whisper.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he responded with a careless shrug. \u201cIs it supposed to mean anything more?\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, the elevator stopped at the lobby floor and the doors opened. Philip was grateful for the chance to escape.</p><p>\u201cObviously not,\u201d she answered, but her eyes went blank and she stared past him. Then she leaned over and stabbed the basement button again. She crouched down to collect her laundry as he stepped out, clutching his gym bag.</p><p>He felt guilty and sad. He hadn\u2019t meant to hurt Carrie. She\u2019d touched Mackenzie\u2019s life and his with her generosity of spirit.</p><p>Philip cursed himself for the fool he was.</p><p>\u201cGo after her,\u201d a voice behind him advised.</p><p>Irritated, he turned to find Maria and Madame Frederick standing behind him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good woman,\u201d Maria said, holding a fat calico cat on her arm, stroking its fur. \u201cYou won\u2019t find another like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could do worse.\u201d Madame Frederick chuckled. \u201cThe fact is, you already have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you two kindly stay out of my affairs?\u201d</p><p>Both women looked taken aback by his gruff, cold response to their friendly advice.</p><p>\u201cHow rude!\u201d the retired schoolteacher exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cNever mind, dearie. Some men need more help than we can give them.\u201d Madame Frederick\u2019s words were pointed.</p><p>Disgusted with the two busybodies, and even more so with himself, Philip hurried out of the apartment building, determined that, from here on out, he was taking the stairs. Without exception.</p><p>Six</p><p>\u201cDid I ever tell you about Randolf?\u201d Madame Frederick asked as she poured Carrie a cup of tea the next Saturday morning. \u201cWe met when I was a girl. All right, I was twenty, but a naive twenty. I knew the moment our eyes met that I should fear for my virtue.\u201d She paused, her hand holding the lid of the teapot in place, her eyes caught in the loving memory of forty years past. Laughing softly, she continued. \u201cWe were married within a week of meeting. We both knew we were meant to be together. It was useless to fight fate.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe was your husband?\u201d Although Madame Frederick had obviously loved him deeply, she rarely talked about her marriage.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She sighed. \u201cThe man who stole my heart. We had thirty happy years together. We fought like cats and dogs and we loved each other. Oh, how we loved each other. One look from that man could curl my toes. He could say to me with one glance what would take three hundred pages in a book.\u201d</p><p>Carrie added sugar to her tea and stirred. Her hand trembled slightly as her mind drifted back to the kisses she\u2019d shared with Philip in the elevator. She\u2019d taken the stairs ever since. She\u2019d been kissed before, plenty of times, but it had never felt like it had with Philip. What unsettled her was how perfectly she understood what her neighbor was saying about Randolf.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t remarry after he died,\u201d Madame Frederick said as she slipped into the chair next to Carrie. \u201cMy heart wouldn\u2019t let me.\u201d She reached for her teacup. \u201cNot many women are as fortunate as I am to have found a love so great, and at such a tender age.\u201d</p> <p>Carrie sipped her tea and struggled to concentrate on Madame Frederick\u2019s words, although her thoughts were on Philip\u2014and his kisses. She wanted to push the memories out of her mind, but they refused to leave.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to give you your Christmas present early,\u201d Madame Frederick announced and set a small, wrapped package in her lap.</p><p>\u201cI have something for you, too, but I was going to wait until Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to open yours now.\u201d</p><p>The older woman watched as Carrie untied the gold ribbon and peeled away the paper. Inside the box was a small glass bowl filled with dried herbs and flowers. Despite the cellophane covering, she could smell the concoction. Potpourri? The scent reminded her a bit of sage.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fertility potion,\u201d Madame Frederick explained.</p><p>\u201cFertility!\u201d Carrie nearly dropped the delicate bowl.</p><p>\u201cBrew these leaves as a tea and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadame Frederick, I have no intention of getting pregnant anytime soon!\u201d</p><p>The woman smiled and said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the gesture, really I do.\u201d She didn\u2019t want her friend to think she wasn\u2019t grateful, but she had no plans to have a child within the foreseeable future. \u201cI\u2019m sure that at some point down the road I\u2019ll be brewing up this potion of yours.\u201d She took another drink of her tea and caught sight of the time. \u201cOh, dear,\u201d she said, rising quickly to her feet. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be somewhere in five minutes.\u201d Mackenzie had generously offered to buy her lunch as a Christmas gift. Philip\u2019s daughter had written the invitation on a lovely card shaped like a silver bell.</p> <p>\u201cThank you again, Madame Frederick,\u201d she said, downing the last of the tea. She carefully tucked the unwrapped Christmas gift in her purse and reached for her coat.</p><p>\u201cCome and visit me again soon,\u201d Madame Frederick said.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Carrie promised. She enjoyed her time with her neighbor, although she generally didn\u2019t understand how Madame chose their topics of conversation. Her reminiscences about her long-dead husband had seemed a bit odd, especially the comment about fearing for her virtue. It was almost as if Madame Frederick knew what she and Philip had been doing in the darkened elevator. Her cheeks went red as she remembered the way she\u2019d responded to him. There was no telling what might have happened had the lights not come on when they did.</p><p>Carrie hurried out of the apartment and down the wind-blown street to the deli on the corner. It was lovely of Mackenzie to ask her to lunch and to create such a special invitation.</p><p>The deli, a neighborhood favorite, was busy. Inside, she was greeted by a variety of mouthwatering smells. Patrons lined up next to a glass counter that displayed sliced meats, cheeses and tempting salads. The refrigerator case was decorated with a plastic swag of evergreen, dotted with tiny red berries.</p><p>\u201cOver here!\u201d Carrie heard Mackenzie\u2019s shout and glanced across the room to see the teenager on her feet, waving. The kid had been smart enough to claim a table, otherwise they might\u2019ve ended up having to wait.</p><p>Carrie gestured back and made her way between the tables and chairs to meet her. Not until she reached the back of the room did she realize that Mackenzie wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>Philip sat with his daughter. His eyes revealed his shock at seeing Carrie there, as well.</p> <p>\u201cOh, good, I was afraid you were going to be late,\u201d Mackenzie said, handing her a menu. \u201cTell me what you want, and I\u2019ll get in line and order it.\u201d</p><p>Briefly Carrie toyed with the idea of canceling, but that would\u2019ve disappointed Mackenzie, which she didn\u2019t want to do. Philip had apparently reached the same conclusion.</p><p>\u201cRemember I\u2019m on a limited budget,\u201d Mackenzie reminded them, speaking loudly to be heard over the hustle and bustle of the deli. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to order peanut butter and jelly, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a pastrami on whole wheat, hold the pickle, extra mustard.\u201d</p><p>Carrie set her menu aside. \u201cMake that two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like pastrami, too?\u201d Mackenzie asked, making it sound incredible that two people actually found the same kind of sandwich to their liking.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better go line up,\u201d Philip advised his daughter.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be back before you know it.\u201d She smiled before she left, expertly weaving between tables.</p><p>Carrie unwound the wool scarf from her neck and removed her jacket. She could be adult about this. While it was true that they hadn\u2019t expected to run into each other, she could cope.</p><p>The noise around them was almost deafening, but the silence between them seemed louder. When she couldn\u2019t stand it any longer, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s very sweet of Mackenzie to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be fooled,\u201d he returned gruffly. \u201cMackenzie knew exactly what she was doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what was that?\u201d Carrie hated to be defensive, but she didn\u2019t like his tone or his implication.</p><p>\u201cShe set this up so you and I would be forced to spend time together.\u201d</p><p>He made it sound like a fate worse than high taxes. \u201cCome on, Philip, I\u2019m not such a terrible person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, that\u2019s the problem.\u201d</p><p>His words lifted her spirits. She took a bread stick from the tall glass in the middle of the table and broke it in half. \u201cAre you suggesting I actually tempt you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far, so don\u2019t flatter yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d She knew a bluff when she heard one. \u201cIf anyone should be flattered it\u2019s you. First, I\u2019m at least eight years younger than you, with endless possibilities when it comes to finding myself a man. What makes you think I\u2019d be interested in an ill-tempered, unfriendly, almost middle-aged grump?\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo can play that game, Philip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI almost believed you, you know. You were taking advantage of the dark? Really, you might\u2019ve been a bit more original.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cBut no one\u2019s that good an actor. You\u2019re attracted to me, but you\u2019re scared to let go of the rein you\u2019ve got on your emotions. I\u2019m not sure what your problem is, but my guess is that it has to do with your divorce. So be it. If you\u2019re content to spend the rest of your days alone, far be it from me to stop you.\u201d She took a bite of the bread stick, chomping down hard.</p><p>Mackenzie had their order. She carried the tray above her head as she reversed her previous journey among the tables. Her eyes were bright with excitement when she rejoined them.</p><p>She handed one thick ceramic plate to Carrie. \u201cPastrami on whole wheat, no pickle and extra mustard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Carrie said, taking the plate from her. She was grateful Mackenzie had returned when she did, unsure she could continue her own bluff much longer. As it was, Philip had no opportunity to challenge her statement, which was exactly the way she wanted it.</p><p>Mackenzie distributed the rest of the sandwiches, set the tray aside and flopped down in the seat between Carrie and Philip. \u201cDon\u2019t you just love the holidays?\u201d she asked before biting into her sandwich.</p><p>Philip\u2019s eyes locked with Carrie\u2019s. \u201cSure do,\u201d he said, but Carrie saw that he was gritting his teeth.</p><p>From the way Philip tore into the sandwich, anyone would think he hadn\u2019t eaten in a week. It was as though they were taking part in a contest to see who\u2019d finish first.</p><p>Philip won. The minute he swallowed the last bite, he stood, thanked his daughter and excused himself.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going back to work,\u201d Mackenzie explained sadly as she watched her father leave. \u201cHe\u2019s always going back to the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInviting us both to lunch was very thoughtful of you,\u201d Carrie said, \u201cbut your father seems to think you asked us to suit your own purposes.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie lowered her gaze. \u201cAll right, I did, but is that such a bad thing? I like you better than anyone. It\u2019s clear that my dad\u2019s never going to get married again without my help. My parents have been divorced for three years now and he\u2019s never even gone out on a real date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMackenzie, your father needs time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime? He\u2019s had more than enough time! He can\u2019t keep going through life like this. He\u2019s put everything on hold while he tries to forget what my mother did. I want him to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMackenzie!\u201d Carrie exhaled sharply. She couldn\u2019t allow the girl to believe that dealing with human emotions was this simple. \u201cI can\u2019t marry your father just because you want me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do, very much, but there\u2019s so much more to marriage than me liking your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he cares about you. I know he does, only he\u2019s afraid to let it show.\u201d</p><p>Carrie had already guessed as much, but that could be because she wanted to believe it so badly.</p><p>\u201cMy mom is really pretty,\u201d Mackenzie said, and she lowered her gaze to her hands, which clutched a paper napkin. \u201cI think she might\u2019ve been disappointed that I look more like my dad\u2019s side of the family than hers. She\u2019s never said anything, but I had the feeling maybe she would\u2019ve stayed married to my dad if I\u2019d been prettier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that isn\u2019t true.\u201d Carrie\u2019s heart ached at the pain she heard in the girl\u2019s voice. \u201cI used to feel those kinds of things, too. My dad never wanted anything to do with me. He never wrote or sent me a birthday gift or remembered me at Christmas, and I was convinced it was something I must have done.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie raised her eyes. \u201cBut you were a little kid when your parents divorced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter. I felt that somehow I was the one to blame. But it didn\u2019t have anything to do with me. And your parents didn\u2019t divorce because you took after your father\u2019s side of the family. Your parents\u2019 problems had nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie didn\u2019t say anything for a long moment. \u201cThis is why I want you to marry my dad. You make me feel better. In the past couple weeks you\u2019ve been more of a mom to me than my real mother ever was.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carrie reached out and silently squeezed Mackenzie\u2019s hand.</p><p>The girl squeezed back. \u201cI didn\u2019t mention it last Saturday, but that was the first time I\u2019ve ever baked homemade cookies. Dad helped me bake a cake once, but it came in a box.\u201d</p><p>Carrie had suspected as much.</p><p>\u201cI like the way we can sit down and talk. You seem to understand what\u2019s in my heart,\u201d Mackenzie murmured. \u201cI\u2019m probably the only girl in my school who knows how to crochet, even though all I can do is those snowflakes. You taught me that. The house is going to be finished soon, and Dad and I are going to move away. I\u2019m afraid that if you don\u2019t marry my dad, I\u2019ll never see you again. Won\u2019t you please, please marry my dad?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, sweetheart,\u201d Carrie whispered and wrapped her arm around the girl\u2019s neck. She leaned forward, resting her forehead on Mackenzie\u2019s head. \u201cIt isn\u2019t as simple as that. Couldn\u2019t I just be your friend?\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie sniffled and nodded. \u201cWill you come visit me when we move?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Madame Frederick says my dad\u2019s going to meet someone and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Carrie groaned inwardly. \u201cMadame Frederick means well, and she\u2019s a dear, dear person, but I\u2019m going to tell you something that\u2019s just between you and me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Mackenzie stared at her intently.</p><p>\u201cMadame Frederick can\u2019t really see anything in that crystal ball of hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. She says what she thinks should happen or what she hopes will happen, and in doing so puts the idea in people\u2019s minds. If her predictions come true, it\u2019s because those people have steered the course of their lives in the direction she pointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she seems so sure of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer confidence is all part of the act.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn other words,\u201d Mackenzie said after a thoughtful moment, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t believe anything she tells me.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>If Carrie hadn\u2019t seen it with her own eyes\u2014and dozens of times at that\u2014she wouldn\u2019t have believed any two boys could be so much like their father. Doug and Dillon sat on the sofa next to Jason, watching the Seahawks football game. Three pairs of feet, each clothed in white socks, were braced on the coffee table, crossed at the ankles. Jason had the remote control at his side, a bowl of popcorn in his lap. Each one of his sons held a smaller bowl. So intent were they on the hotly contested play-off game that they gave Carrie little more than a hurried nod of acknowledgment.</p><p>The sight of Jason with his sons never ceased to amaze her. The boys were all Manning, too. Smaller versions of their father in both looks and temperament.</p><p>Carrie found her mother in the kitchen, whipping up a batch of fudge for the Manning family pre-Christmas get-together. \u201cCarrie, this is a pleasant surprise.\u201d Charlotte\u2019s face relaxed into a smile when she saw her daughter.</p><p>\u201cI came for some motherly advice,\u201d Carrie admitted, seeing no need to tiptoe around the reason for her impromptu visit. She\u2019d left Mackenzie less than an hour before and hadn\u2019t been able to stop thinking about their conversation, or about Philip\u2019s reaction to her being there. It was as though he couldn\u2019t escape fast enough.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Charlotte stirred the melted chocolate.</p><p>Carrie pulled a padded stool over to the countertop where her mother was working. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m falling in love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She\u2019d purposely chosen that word. That was exactly the way she felt about it.</p><p>\u201cThis wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with your friend Mackenzie, would it?\u201d</p><p>Carrie nodded, surprised her mother even knew about the thirteen-year-old girl. But the boys must have said something. \u201cDo you remember how it was when you first started dating Jason?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Her mother paused and a hint of a smile lifted the edges of her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m not likely to forget. I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted anything to do with the man, while you were busy inventing excuses to throw us together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really weren\u2019t interested in him at first?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte chuckled softly. \u201cThat\u2019s putting it mildly, but gradually he won me over. He was endlessly patient......\u201d</p><p>Carrie realized there was a lot more that her mother wasn\u2019t telling her. She\u2019d long suspected that in the early days, her mother\u2019s relationship with Jason had been anything but smooth.</p><p>Charlotte resumed stirring. \u201cAs I said, his patience won me over. His patience and his drop-dead kisses,\u201d she amended. \u201cIf ever a man had a talent for kissing, it\u2019s your stepfather.\u201d She grinned shyly and looked away.</p><p>\u201cPhilip has the same gift,\u201d Carrie whispered, feeling a bit shy about sharing this aspect of their relationship with her mother.</p><p>Charlotte didn\u2019t say anything for a long moment. \u201cSo you\u2019ve been seeing Mackenzie\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as much as I\u2019d like,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s been divorced for three years and according to Mackenzie he hasn\u2019t gone out on a single date.\u201d She assumed that well-meaning friends had tried to set him up. His own daughter had made the effort, too. With Carrie.</p><p>\u201cSo he comes with a load of emotional trauma. Has he ever talked about what went wrong in his marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Carrie hated to admit how little time they\u2019d spent together. Feeding Maria\u2019s homeless cats was as close as they\u2019d come to an actual date. She wasn\u2019t sure how to measure the time in the elevator. Although she\u2019d managed to make him think his callous attitude afterward hadn\u2019t fooled her, in truth she didn\u2019t know what his reaction had been.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid he\u2019s coming to mean more to you than is sensible, after so short an acquaintance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. But, Mom, he\u2019s constantly on my mind. I go to bed at night, close my eyes and he\u2019s there. I get up in the morning and take the bus to the office and all I can think about is him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s attracted to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so...... I don\u2019t know anymore. My guess is that he is, but he\u2019s fighting it. He doesn\u2019t want to care for me. He\u2019d rather I lived across the city\u2014or the country\u2014than in the same building with him. We try to avoid each other\u2014we probably wouldn\u2019t see each other at all if it wasn\u2019t for Mackenzie. The girl\u2019s made it her mission in life to make sure we do.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte dumped the warm fudge into a buttered cookie sheet. \u201cThis is beginning to sound familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte giggled. \u201cOh, Carrie, how soon you forget. You\u2019re the one who pushed, pulled and shoved me into a relationship with Jason. It would\u2019ve been horrible if he was a different kind of man. But he was patient and nonthreatening. Like Philip, I came into the relationship with more than my share of emotional trauma. But he was exactly the man I needed. You\u2019ve always been a sensitive, intuitive child. Out of all the men you might have picked for me, you chose the one man who possessed the qualities I needed most.\u201d She reached over and stroked the side of Carrie\u2019s face, her expression warm and tender. \u201cIn my heart of hearts, I\u2019m confident you\u2019ve done the same thing for yourself. Philip needs you just as much as I needed Jason. Be patient with him, Carrie. Your heart\u2014and your ego\u2014may take a few jabs before this is finished. Be prepared for that, but don\u2019t be afraid to love him. Mackenzie, too. I promise you, it\u2019ll be worth the wait.\u201d</p><p>How wise her mother was, Carrie mused as she left the family home. How wise and wonderful. Not for the first time, Carrie was grateful for a mother she could talk to, a mother she could confide in, a mother who didn\u2019t judge, but listened and advised.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Gene Tarkington asked, stepping into Philip\u2019s office. He leaned against the doorjamb, striking a relaxed pose. The entire floor was empty. Row upon row of desks stretched across the floor outside his office.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d come in and run these figures one last time,\u201d Philip murmured, staring at the computer screen. Although he considered Gene one of his best friends, he\u2019d prefer to be alone just then.</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy, it\u2019s almost Christmas. Haven\u2019t you got anything better to do than stop by the office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Philip challenged. He wasn\u2019t the only workaholic in this company.</p><p>\u201cI came to get some papers and saw the light on in your office. I thought you were having lunch with Mackenzie this afternoon. A little father-daughter t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate. That kid\u2019s a real sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had our lunch,\u201d Philip muttered, \u201cbut it turns out I wasn\u2019t the only one Mackenzie invited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean she brought along that neighbor friend of yours? The woman who works for Microsoft?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s her.\u201d Philip frowned anew, remembering how upset he\u2019d been when he discovered what Mackenzie had done. From the way she\u2019d acted, he should\u2019ve guessed she\u2019d try something like this. What distressed him even more was the way his heart had responded when Carrie walked into the deli. The joy and excitement he\u2019d felt.....</p><p>But he didn\u2019t want to feel these things for her. It\u2019d taken effort to steel himself against those very emotions. He\u2019d been burned once, badly enough to know better than to play with fire. Carrie Weston wasn\u2019t some little innocent, either. Every time he was with her, he felt as if he was holding a book of matches.</p><p>\u201cMackenzie\u2019s pretty levelheaded. What have you got against this neighbor woman? She\u2019s not ugly, is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He recalled what a shock it was when he realized how lovely Carrie was.</p><p>\u201cIf you want my opinion, I\u2019d say count your blessings. Generally, the divorced guys I know would welcome a woman their daughters like. Remember what happened to Cal? His daughter and second wife hate each other. Any time they\u2019re out together, Cal has to keep them from coming to blows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Cal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me that if your daughter\u2019s that keen on this neighbor, you should take the time to find out what she likes so much. I\u2019m no expert on women or romance, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thoughts exactly,\u201d Philip said pointedly. He\u2019d come to the office to escape Carrie, not to have her name thrown in his face. \u201cI appreciate what you\u2019re trying to do.\u201d</p><p>Gene rubbed the side of his face. \u201cI doubt that. But I hate to see you wasting time in this office when Christmas is only a few days away. If you want to hide, there are better places than here.\u201d</p><p>Although Gene\u2019s tone was friendly enough, the words made Philip\u2019s jaw tighten. It was all he could do to keep from blaming his friend for his troubles. Gene owned the apartment complex, and it was because of him that Philip and Mackenzie were living there.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got to get back to the car. Marilyn\u2019s waiting. You know how it is the last weekend before Christmas. The malls are a madhouse and naturally my wife thinks this is the perfect time to finish the shopping. She wouldn\u2019t dream of going alone. I told her there should be a Husband of the Year award in this for me,\u201d he said, and chuckled. \u201cBut she promised me another kind of reward.\u201d From the contented, anticipatory look on his friend\u2019s face, one would think Gene was headed for the final game of the World Series, not a shopping mall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSee you later,\u201d Philip said.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d Gene returned. \u201cJust promise me you won\u2019t stay here long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Gene left, and the office had never seemed emptier. The place seemed to echo with loneliness, a constant reminder that Philip was by himself. His friend was right; it was almost Christmas, yet he was at the office hiding. While Gene was out fighting the Christmas crowds with his wife, Philip had crept in here, the way he always did whenever life threatened to offer him something he couldn\u2019t handle. Even a gift.</p> <p>Because that was what Gene had more or less told him Carrie was. A woman Mackenzie not only liked, but championed. Like Gene, lots of guys would advise him to count his blessings. But instead of thanking his daughter for lunch, he\u2019d chastised her for using it as an opportunity to get him together with Carrie.</p><p>Carrie.</p><p>Every time he thought of her, a chill raced through his blood. No, that wasn\u2019t it. His blood didn\u2019t go cold, it heated up. Carrie was charming, generous, delightful, kind\u2014and more of a mother to his daughter than her own had ever been.</p><p>Philip rolled his chair away from his desk, stood and walked over to the large picture window. The view of downtown Seattle and Puget Sound was spectacular from his twentieth-story viewpoint. Breathtaking. The waterfront, the ferry dock, Pike Place Market, all alive with activity. Philip couldn\u2019t count the number of times he\u2019d stood exactly where he was now and looked out and seen nothing, felt nothing.</p><p>He went back to his desk and turned off his computer, feeling more confused than when he\u2019d arrived. It was a sad day, he thought wryly, when he was reduced to accepting his thirteen-year-old daughter\u2019s advice, but in this case, Mackenzie was right. She\u2019d told him to get a life. Instead, Philip had dug himself deeper into his rut, fearing that any life he got would include putting the past behind him. It wasn\u2019t that the past held any allure for him. The reverse, in fact. He\u2019d married too young, unwisely. He was terrified of repeating the same mistake. Terrified of what that would do to him\u2014and Mackenzie.</p> <p>Locking up, Philip went back to the apartment building. He parked in the garage across the street and was just walking toward the entrance when he saw Carrie. There was a natural buoyancy to her step, a joy that radiated from inside her. He sometimes wondered what she had to be so happy about. That no longer concerned him, because he wanted whatever it was.</p><p>\u201cCarrie!\u201d Unsure what he\u2019d say when he caught up with her, Philip hurried across the street.</p><p>Carrie paused midway up the steps and turned around. Some of the happiness left her eyes when she saw him. She waited until he\u2019d reached her before she spoke. \u201cI had no idea Mackenzie had invited us both to lunch,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d he said, regretting his angry mood earlier.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>Every time he saw her it was a shock to realize how beautiful she was. Her intense blue eyes cut straight through him. \u201cI was wondering.....I know it\u2019s last-minute and you\u2019ve probably got other plans, but.....\u201d He paused. \u201cWould you go Christmas shopping with me?\u201d He was afraid that if he invited her to dinner or a movie she\u2019d turn him down and he wouldn\u2019t blame her. \u201cFor Mackenzie,\u201d he said, adding incentive. \u201cI could do with a few suggestions.\u201d</p> <p>His invitation had apparently taken her by surprise because she frowned at him before asking, \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs now convenient?\u201d he asked hopefully. He was as crazy as his friend Gene to even consider going shopping today.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she repeated, then smiled, that soft, sweet smile of hers. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Okay. It was crazy how one small word could produce such exhilaration. If this were the theater, he\u2019d break into song about now. A Christmas carol maybe\u2014something like \u201cJoy to the World.\u201d</p><p>She walked down the three or four steps to join him on the sidewalk. That little bounce of hers was back. The bounce that said she was glad to be alive and glad to be with him.</p><p>He was the one who should be grateful, Philip thought. He tucked her arm in his and led her back to the parking garage.</p><p>Life was good. It had been a long time since he\u2019d believed that, but he did now.</p><p>Eight</p> <p>A few hours earlier, Carrie had been telling her mother that she barely knew Philip Lark and now she doubted there was any man she knew better. They sat in an Italian restaurant, Christmas packages around their feet, and talked until it seemed there was nothing more to say. Their dinner dishes had long since been removed and Philip poured the last of the red wine into her goblet.</p><p>The room swayed gently from side to side, but her lightheadedness wasn\u2019t due to the pinot noir. Philip was the reason. He\u2019d told her things she\u2019d felt it would take him months if not years to reveal. He\u2019d spoken of his marriage and his feelings about fatherhood. She listened, a lump in her throat, as he heaped the blame for the failure of his marriage on his own shoulders. She doubted very much that he was entirely responsible, but she admired his gallantry.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re friends with Laura?\u201d she asked at one point.</p><p>\u201cYes. Beyond anything else, she\u2019s Mackenzie\u2019s mother. I made mistakes in this marriage, but my daughter wasn\u2019t one of them. I\u2019ll always be grateful to my ex-wife for Mackenzie.\u201d</p><p>Tears formed in the corners of Carrie\u2019s eyes at the sincerity with which he spoke. How easy it would be for him to blame his ex-wife for all their problems. Carrie was sympathetic to his side, and knew from things Mackenzie had told her that Laura wasn\u2019t exactly a loving or attentive mother. Carrie suspected she hadn\u2019t been much of a wife, either.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing tomorrow?\u201d Philip asked unexpectedly.</p><p>\u201cSunday.\u201d Carrie propped her elbows on the white linen tablecloth. \u201cThe Mannings are getting together. Mom and I married into this large, wonderful family. Jason has four brothers and sisters. There are so many grandchildren these days it\u2019s difficult to keep track of who belongs to whom. Why don\u2019t you and Mackenzie come along and meet everyone?\u201d Carrie couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d impulsively tossed out the invitation. While she did want him to attend, there\u2019d certainly be speculation......</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive. Just.....Never mind,\u201d she said, stopping herself. Her gaze held his. \u201cIt would mean a great deal to me if you\u2019d come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we will.\u201d He reached for her hand with both of his.</p><p>Philip had given up the effort of remembering everyone\u2019s names. He\u2019d cataloged the first ten or so relatives Carrie had introduced him to, but the others became lost in the maze.</p><p>Mackenzie had disappeared almost the minute they arrived. Doug and Dillon had greeted him cheerfully and then quickly vanished with his daughter. Holding a cup of eggnog, Philip found himself a quiet corner.</p><p>From this vantage point, he watched Carrie interact with her family. His eyes followed her as she moved across the room, apparently to find her mother so she could introduce her parents to Philip. He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Carrie. Her face was flushed with happiness, her eyes glowing with excitement. She\u2019d married into this family, but it was clear they thought of her as one of their own.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I join you?\u201d a woman unexpectedly asked him.</p><p>\u201cPlease do.\u201d He stood to offer her his seat.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Sit down, please. I can only stay a moment. You\u2019re Philip, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Philip Lark.\u201d The dark-haired beauty had to be Carrie\u2019s mother. \u201cYou\u2019re Charlotte Manning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow perceptive of you. Yes.\u201d She held out her hand, which he shook.</p><p>He was astonished that he hadn\u2019t recognized the resemblance sooner. Charlotte and Carrie had the same intense blue eyes, the same joyous energy and a gentleness of spirit that was unmistakable.</p><p>They spoke for a few minutes about unimportant matters. Small talk. Although Philip had the impression he was being checked out, he also had the feeling that he\u2019d passed muster. He liked Charlotte, which made sense, since he definitely liked Carrie.</p><p>\u201cSo this is Carrie\u2019s young man.\u201d Charlotte\u2019s husband, Jason Manning, joined his wife and slipped his arm around her waist. \u201cWelcome. Where\u2019s Carrie? She\u2019s left you to fend for yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gather she went in search of you two.\u201d</p><p>The three of them spoke for a while before Jason glanced over his shoulder and called out, \u201cPaul, come and meet Carrie\u2019s friend.\u201d</p><p>Soon a large group had gathered around Philip, more faces than he could ever remember. He stood and shook hands with Carrie\u2019s two uncles. Once again he felt their scrutiny.</p><p>Soon a loud, \u201cHo, ho, ho,\u201d could be heard in the background. Jason\u2019s father had donned a Santa suit and now paraded into the room, a bag of gifts swung over his shoulder. The children let out cries of glee and crowded around Santa.</p><p>Philip was grateful that everyone had begun to watch the scene taking place with Santa Claus. He sat down in his chair again and relaxed, grateful not to be the center of attention. Soon Carrie was with him. She sat on the arm and cast him an apologetic look.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I got sidetracked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I saw.\u201d He patted her hand. \u201cI met your stepfather and two uncles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t they great?\u201d Her eyes gleamed with pride.</p><p>\u201cI need a degree in math to keep track of who\u2019s married to whom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll come. Be thankful not everyone\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean there are even more?\u201d</p><p>Carrie grinned and nodded. \u201cTaylor and Christy both live in Montana. Between them they have six children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy goodness.\u201d Adding ten more names to his list would have overwhelmed him. \u201cMackenzie certainly seems to fit right in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoug and Dillon think she\u2019s the best thing since cookie-dough ice cream. Knowing her gives them the edge over their cousins.\u201d</p><p>While the youngsters gathered around their grandfather in his red suit, Mackenzie made her way toward him and Carrie. Philip understood. At thirteen she was too old to mingle with the kids who believed in Santa Claus, and too young not to be caught up in the excitement, even though Santa wouldn\u2019t have a gift for her.</p><p>\u201cAre you having fun?\u201d Philip whispered when she sat down on the chair\u2019s other arm, across from Carrie.</p><p>\u201cThis is so great,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI didn\u2019t know families could get this big. Everyone\u2019s so friendly.\u201d</p><p>Santa dug deep into his bag, produced a package and called out the name. Doug leaped to his feet and raced forward as if he had only a limited amount of time to collect his prize.</p><p>Santa reached inside his bag again and removed another gift. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked, lowering his glasses to read the tag. \u201cThis is for someone named Mackenzie Lark. I do hope Mrs. Claus didn\u2019t mix up the gifts with those of another family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMackenzie\u2019s here!\u201d Dillon shouted. He stood and pointed toward Philip and Carrie.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Mackenzie slid off the chair. \u201cThere\u2019s a gift in there for me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf your name\u2019s Mackenzie, then I\u2019d say this present is for you.\u201d</p><p>His daughter didn\u2019t need a second invitation. She hurried over to Santa, as eager as Doug had been.</p><p>Philip\u2019s questioning gaze sought out Carrie\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m sure my mother\u2019s responsible for this,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI met her,\u201d he said. \u201cWe talked briefly.\u201d</p> <p>Carrie\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhat did she have to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was very pleasant. It was your stepfather who put the fear of God into me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason? Oh, dear. Listen, whatever he said, disregard it. He means well and I love him to death, but half the time he\u2019s thinking about sports statistics and he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s saying.\u201d</p><p>Philip smiled. He\u2019d never seen Carrie more unnerved. Even when they were trapped in the elevator, she\u2019d displayed more composure than this.</p><p>\u201cCarrie, good grief, what do you think he said?\u201d</p> <p>She clamped her mouth shut. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019m not sure, but it would be just like him to suggest you take the plunge and marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that, well.....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me he actually\u2014\u201d</p><p>Philip had to make an effort not to laugh out loud. \u201cHe didn\u2019t, so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie had claimed her gift and was walking back, clutching the package in both hands.</p><p>\u201cYou can open it,\u201d Carrie assured her.</p> <p>\u201cNow?\u201d She tore into the wrapping as though she couldn\u2019t wait a second longer. Inside was an elegant vanity mirror with a brush and comb set. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d she whispered, holding the brush and comb against her. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted one of these sets. It\u2019s so.....so feminine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d your family know?\u201d Philip asked. He\u2019d never have thought to buy something like this for his daughter.</p><p>\u201cI have one,\u201d Carrie whispered. \u201cShe\u2019s used it a number of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d More and more he felt inadequate when it came to understanding his daughter. She was in that awkward stage, and it was difficult to know exactly where her interests lay. Half the time she talked about wanting a horse and ballet lessons; the rest of the time she listened to music he\u2019d never heard before and gossiped about celebrities who seemed completely irrelevant to him. Part girl, part woman, Mackenzie traveled uneasily from one desire to the next. It wasn\u2019t just her interests that confused him, either. One minute she\u2019d be her lighthearted self and the next she\u2019d be in tears over something he considered trivial. He wished Laura had taken more interest in her. Often he felt at a loss in dealing with Mackenzie\u2019s frequent mood swings.</p><p>Philip had enjoyed himself, but he was exhausted and felt relieved when the party ended. He thanked the elder Mannings for having him and Mackenzie.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome anytime,\u201d Elizabeth Manning said, clasping his hand between both of her own. In what seemed an impulsive gesture, she leaned forward and kissed his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019d be a welcome addition to our family,\u201d she whispered in his ear. \u201cJust promise me one thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI want a nice, big wedding,\u201d she said, this time loudly enough for half the room to hear.</p> <p>Philip heard a murmur of approval behind him. \u201cAh.....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks again, Grandma,\u201d Carrie said, saving him from having to come up with a response.</p><p>Carrie hugged the older couple and led the way outside. Jason, Charlotte, Doug and Dillon followed them to the driveway for a second round of hugs and farewells. This had to be one of the most outwardly affectionate families Philip had ever met, but it didn\u2019t bother him. The opposite, in fact. He liked everything about them. These were good people, hardworking and family-oriented. He\u2019d never seen himself in that light, although it was what he wanted to be. However, neither he nor Laura had been raised that way.</p><p>They sang Christmas carols on the drive home. Carrie\u2019s voice blended smoothly with that of his daughter. His own was a bit rough from disuse and slightly off-key, but no one seemed to mind, least of all Mackenzie, whose happiness spilled over like fizz in a soda bottle. He parked in the garage and they walked across the street to the apartment building, still laughing and chattering excitedly.</p><p>\u201cI had a wonderful time,\u201d his daughter told Carrie, hugging her close as they waited for the elevator.</p><p>\u201cI did, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad your family get-together was tonight instead of tomorrow. I\u2019ll be with my mother, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cYou\u2019ll miss the party here, but I\u2019ll tell you all about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Madame Frederick will made a prediction for me, even if I\u2019m not there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she will,\u201d Carrie answered.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll have to make one for me in absentia, as well,\u201d Philip said.</p><p>You aren\u2019t coming? This news appeared to catch Carrie by surprise. She\u2019d asked him about the Christmas party earlier and he\u2019d managed to avoid answering one way or the other.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, pushing the button to close the elevator door.</p><p>\u201cBut I thought.....I hoped.....\u201d Her disappointment was evident.</p><p>Philip didn\u2019t want to say anything negative, but as far as he was concerned, the majority of people living in the building complex were oddballs and eccentrics. He didn\u2019t have anything against them, but he didn\u2019t want to socialize with them, either.</p><p>\u201cTalk him into it,\u201d Mackenzie said when the elevator stopped on Carrie\u2019s floor.</p><p>He wished now that he hadn\u2019t said anything. \u201cWould you like a cup of coffee?\u201d Carrie asked.</p><p>What he\u2019d like was time alone with Carrie.</p><p>\u201cSure he would,\u201d Mackenzie answered for him, and shoved him out of the elevator. The doors closed before he could respond.</p><p>\u201cI guess I would,\u201d he said, chuckling.</p><p>Carrie\u2019s eyes shyly met his. \u201cI was hoping you would.\u201d</p><p>She unlocked her door and walked inside, but he stopped her from turning on the light. With his hand at her shoulder, he guided her into his arms. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this all night,\u201d he whispered and claimed her lips.</p><p>He meant it to be a soft, gentle kiss. One that would tell her he\u2019d enjoyed her company, enjoyed their evening together. But the minute his mouth settled over hers he experienced a desire so strong it was all he could do to keep it in check. No woman had ever affected him like this. He wove his fingers into her hair and tilted her head to one side in order to deepen their kisses.</p><p>She groaned softly. Then again, it could be the sound of his own pleasure that rang in his ears. The hot, breathless kisses went on. And on.....</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you come to the party tomorrow night?\u201d she asked minutes later.</p><p>The building\u2019s Christmas party was the last thing on Philip\u2019s mind. He led her through the darkened living room, sat down and drew her into his lap. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about that later, all right?\u201d He didn\u2019t give her time to say anything, but directed her lips back to his.</p><p>\u201cWhy later?\u201d She nibbled the side of his neck, sending delicious shivers down his back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I trust Madame Frederick.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and he felt her breath against his skin. \u201cShe\u2019s completely harmless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they say.\u201d He placed his hands on either side of her face and brought her lips down to meet his again. The kiss was long and deep, and it left him breathless.</p><p>\u201cThe people in this building are a bunch of oddballs. Half of them are candidates for the loony bin,\u201d he said when he\u2019d recovered sufficiently to speak.</p><p>Carrie stiffened in his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about my friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo offense,\u201d he said. But surely she recognized the truth when she heard it.</p><p>Carrie squirmed out of his lap and stood in front of him. \u201cI live in this apartment complex. Is that how you think about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He sighed. \u201cIf it means so much to you, I\u2019ll attend this ridiculous party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to do me any favors.\u201d</p><p>From her tone of voice, Philip realized he\u2019d managed to offend her, which he regretted. Yesterday\u2019s conversation with Gene had made him understand that she was a blessing in his life. A gift.</p><p>A gift he wanted to accept.....</p><p>\u201cCarrie, I\u2019m sorry. I spoke out of turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you really think of us, Philip?\u201d she asked, her voice uncertain.</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond right away, afraid anything more he said would only make things worse.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s answer enough. I\u2019m tired...... I\u2019d like you to leave now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie, for heaven\u2019s sake, be reasonable.\u201d</p><p>She stalked over to the door and opened it, sending a harsh shaft of light across his face. Philip squinted and did as she asked. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about this later, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said in a sarcastic murmur.</p><p>Rather than wait for the elevator, Philip took the stairs to his apartment a floor above Carrie\u2019s. He\u2019d discuss this with Mackenzie, get her advice on how to handle it. Ironic that he was turning to his thirteen-year-old daughter for help with the very situation she\u2019d engineered......</p><p>The apartment was dark and silent when he entered. He switched on the light and walked down the hall to Mackenzie\u2019s bedroom. Her bed was slightly mussed as if she\u2019d sat on it.</p><p>\u201cMackenzie!\u201d he called.</p><p>No response.</p><p>He checked the other rooms and found a note from her on the kitchen table.Dad,Mom left me a message. She said she wouldn\u2019t be coming for me, after all, and that I couldn\u2019t spend the holidays with her. I guess I should\u2019ve known she\u2019d be too busy for me. She has time for everything else but me. I need some time alone to think.Mackenzie</p><p>Nine</p><p>Carrie didn\u2019t understand why Philip\u2019s comment about Madame Frederick and the others had distressed her so much. While it was true they were her friends, she couldn\u2019t deny that they were all a bit weird. But they were also affectionate, warmhearted people and it hurt to have Philip dismiss them with such carelessness. She was still figuring out her feelings when there was a knock at the door. Whoever it was seemed impatient, because there was another knock immediately afterward.</p><p>\u201cJust a moment,\u201d she called out.</p><p>To her surprise it was Philip. \u201cHave you seen Mackenzie?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNot since we returned from the party.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled and rubbed his hand along the back of his neck. \u201cHer mother left a message for her saying she won\u2019t be bringing Mackenzie to her place for Christmas after all,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Carrie saw a muscle beside his jaw jerk with the effort it took to control his anger.</p><p>\u201cShe was looking forward to spending Christmas with Laura,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt was all Mackenzie could talk about.\u201d</p><p>Carrie knew that. She\u2019d spent time with the girl, discussing her hairstyle and wardrobe for the impending visit. Mackenzie had wanted everything to be perfect for her mother. She\u2019d wanted to impress Laura with how grown-up she was, how stylish. She\u2019d wanted to make herself as attractive as possible, hoping her mother would notice and approve. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMackenzie wrote me a note that said she needed time alone.\u201d He checked his watch, something Carrie knew he\u2019d probably done every five minutes since discovering the note. \u201cThat was an hour ago. Where on earth would she go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Carrie whispered. Her heart constricted as she imagined the pain the girl must be suffering. These few days with Laura had meant so much to Mackenzie.</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe she\u2019d come to you.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve tried her cell, but it\u2019s off. I\u2019ve called her girlfriends, but none of them have heard from her. Now I don\u2019t know where to look. Think, Carrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe probably doesn\u2019t want to be around people just yet,\u201d she murmured, trying to clear her head of worry and fear in order to be of help.</p> <p>Philip nodded. \u201cDo you think she went for a walk? Alone in the dark?\u201d He cringed as he said the words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go out with you to look.\u201d</p><p>His eyes told her he was grateful. Carrie grabbed her coat and purse, and they both rushed out of the building.</p><p>Soon after she\u2019d graduated from high school, when Carrie was eighteen, she\u2019d decided to seek out her father. It had been a mistake. He\u2019d seemed to think she wanted something from him, and in retrospect, she knew she had. She\u2019d wanted him to love her, wanted him to tell her how proud he was of the woman she\u2019d become. It had taken her the better part of a year to realize that Tom Weston was selfish and immature and incapable of giving her anything. Even his approval.</p><p>In the five years she\u2019d known Jason Manning, at that point, he\u2019d been far more of a father than her biological one would ever know how to be. She hadn\u2019t had any contact with Tom Weston since. It had hurt that the man responsible for her birth wanted nothing to do with her, but after a few months she\u2019d accepted his decision. If anything, she appreciated his honesty, hurtful as it\u2019d been at the time.</p> <p>Not really knowing where they were going, they walked quickly from one spot to another, trying to guess where Mackenzie might have gone. Their fears mounted, but they both struggled to hide them. Instead, they offered each other reassurances neither believed.</p><p>\u201cI hate to think of her out in the cold, alone and in pain,\u201d Philip finally murmured, his hands in his coat pockets.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d The cold air stung her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI could hate Laura for doing this to her,\u201d Philip said defiantly, \u201cbut I refuse to waste the energy. She can treat me any way she pleases, but not Mackenzie.\u201d</p><p>Carrie knew it was pointless to remind him that he had no control over his ex-wife. Laura would behave as she chose.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should\u2019ve said something to Mackenzie,\u201d Philip was saying, \u201cwarned her not to count on anything her mother promised. I didn\u2019t because, well, because I didn\u2019t want Mackenzie to think I\u2019d try to influence how she thinks about her mother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI find that admirable. And wise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel either of those things just now.\u201d His voice revealed his anger and frustration.</p><p>\u201cMackenzie\u2019s smart enough to figure out what her mother\u2019s really like. She won\u2019t need you or me to tell her,\u201d Carrie said.</p><p>His eyes met hers under a streetlamp decorated with silver bells. \u201cI hope you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>They searched everywhere they could think of, without success. By the time they returned home, it was almost midnight. The building was dark and silent, alarming them even more.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think she\u2019d do anything stupid, do you?\u201d a worried Philip asked. \u201cLike run away and find her mother on her own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI.....don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>When they stepped into the lobby, Carrie noticed that the door leading to the basement party room was open. As she came closer, she could hear voices below.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s check it out,\u201d Philip suggested.</p><p>Carrie followed him down the stairs. As they descended, the sound of voices became more distinct. She recognized Madame Frederick, chatting away with Arnold. Carrie guessed they were putting the finishing touches on the decorations for the Christmas party, which was to take place the following night.</p><p>They found Mackenzie busy pinning green and red streamers in the center of the ceiling, fanning them out to the corners. The girl didn\u2019t so much as blink when she saw Carrie and Philip.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi, Dad. Hi, Carrie,\u201d she said, climbing down from her chair.</p><p>\u201cJust where have you been, young lady?\u201d Philip demanded gruffly.</p><p>Carrie placed her hand on his arm, pleading with him to display less anger and more compassion. She felt some of the tension leave his muscles and knew it took a great deal of determination not to cross the room and hug the teenager fiercely.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Dad. I forgot to tell you where I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been searching for hours! Then Carrie helped me look. We walked through the whole neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Mackenzie returned contritely. \u201cI sat in here by myself for a while, then these guys came down to decorate and\u2014\u201d she shrugged \u201c\u2014I decided to pitch in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Carrie asked. \u201cI mean, about not being able to spend the holiday with your mother?\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie hesitated and her lower lip trembled slightly. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed, but then as Madame Frederick said, \u2018Time wounds all heels.\u2019\u201d She laughed and wiped her forearm under her nose. \u201cMom\u2019s got to make her own decisions about what role I\u2019ll play in her life. All I can do is give her the freedom to choose. I\u2019ve got my dad and my friends.\u201d Her gaze moved about the room, pausing on each person.</p><p>Arnold was there with his spandex shorts and twinkling eyes. Madame Frederick with her crystal ball and her sometimes corny wisdom. Maria with her tenderhearted care for the neighborhood\u2019s cats. And, Carrie realized, she was there, too. They were Mackenzie\u2019s friends.</p><p>The girl wrapped her arms around her father\u2019s waist and hid her face in his chest. \u201cI\u2019ll be here for the party,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to come, Dad. I\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to come,\u201d he said, his eyes on Carrie. He held out his hand to her and their fingers locked together. \u201cIt takes moments like this for a man to recognize how fortunate he is to be blessed with good friends.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie smiled and glanced over her shoulder at Madame Frederick.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d the older woman said, smiling just as broadly. \u201cThe crystal ball sees all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t help me decide which mutual fund to invest in,\u201d Arnold reminded her. \u201cAnd it didn\u2019t help me pick the winning lottery numbers, either. You can take that crystal ball of yours and store it in a pile of cow manure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you it wouldn\u2019t help you for personal gain,\u201d Madame Frederick said with more than a hint of defensiveness.</p><p>\u201cWhat good is that silly thing if it doesn\u2019t make your friends rich?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt serves its purpose,\u201d Philip surprised everyone by responding. He slid his arm around his daughter\u2019s shoulders. \u201cNow, I\u2019d say we\u2019ve had enough excitement for one evening, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie nodded. \u201cNight, everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d Arnold called.</p><p>\u201cSleep well,\u201d Madame Frederick sang out.</p><p>\u201cGood night, sweetie. You stop by and visit me tomorrow, you hear?\u201d Maria said.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Mackenzie promised.</p><p>Carrie left with Philip and his daughter. \u201cI\u2019m baking cookies for the party in the morning,\u201d she said when the elevator reached her floor.</p><p>\u201cDo you need any help?\u201d Mackenzie asked eagerly. \u201cYou won\u2019t have to worry about eggshells getting in the dough this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love it if you came by.\u201d</p><p>Content that all was well, Carrie entered her apartment and got ready for bed. As she slipped on her nightgown, the phone rang. It was Philip.</p><p>\u201cI know I was with you less than ten minutes ago, but I wanted to thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what? I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d She\u2019d shared his helplessness in searching for Mackenzie, his frustration and anger.</p><p>\u201cYou helped me find my daughter\u2014in more ways than one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, your love for her did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wrong about your friends.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d wondered how long it would take him to admit that.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re as terrific as you are.\u201d He paused. \u201cNot spending time with her mother was a big blow to Mackenzie. She was devastated when Laura put her off once again. I don\u2019t know what Madame Frederick really said, but it was obviously what Mackenzie needed to hear. For all her strangeness, Madame has good instincts about people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fast learner.\u201d</p><p>Philip\u2019s amusement echoed over the phone line. \u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself. I was with the slow reading group in first grade. I\u2019m not exactly a speed demon when it comes to relationships, either. My marriage is a prime example.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come to the Christmas party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith bells on.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cThe thing is, I\u2019ll probably fit right in.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Six months later</p><p>\u201cThis is the most exciting day of my life!\u201d Mackenzie declared, waltzing around the small dressing room in her slender full-length pale green dress. A wreath of spring flowers adorned her head. \u201cYou\u2019re actually going to be my stepmother, just like Madame Frederick said.\u201d</p><p>Only Carrie and Mackenzie were still in the room, as Carrie made her final preparations.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an exciting day for me, too.\u201d Carrie pressed her hands against her stomach to calm her jittery nerves. The church was full of family and friends, waiting for her to make her appearance. Jason, dressed in a tuxedo, would soon escort her down the aisle. Her step-aunts, Christy and Taylor, were also in her wedding party, and so were her two closest friends from college. Gene was Philip\u2019s best man.</p><p>\u201cDad was so cute this morning,\u201d Mackenzie said, laughing. \u201cI thought he was going to throw up his breakfast. He\u2019s so much in love he can hardly eat.\u201d</p><p>Carrie closed her eyes. She hadn\u2019t even attempted breakfast, and applauded Philip for making the effort. As for being in love, she was crazy about him and Mackenzie. This day was a dream come true, worthy of the finest fairy tale.</p><p>\u201cMadame Frederick, Maria and Arnold are here, and lots of people from the office,\u201d Mackenzie said, peering out at the church. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that many people knew my dad.\u201d Gracefully she waltzed her way around Carrie. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be the most beautiful bride ever. That\u2019s what Dad said, and he\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s extra-special that you\u2019re letting me be in the wedding party. Not everyone would do that. My first wedding,\u201d she said, and her eyes held a dreamy, faraway look.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good friend, Mackenzie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably wouldn\u2019t be marrying my dad if it wasn\u2019t for me,\u201d Mackenzie reminded her in a low voice. \u201cBut then, Madame Frederick\u2019s the one who gave me the idea, so I guess I should give her the credit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRemember what I told you about Madame Frederick and her crystal ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.

Madame Frederick couldn\u2019t have known that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased you think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were to pick someone to be my mother, I\u2019d choose you.\u201d Her eyes grew dark. \u201cMy dad needs you almost as much as I do. You\u2019re perfect for both of us. I\u2019d rather spend time with you than anyone, except for Les Williams.\u201d She sighed deeply. \u201cBut then, Les doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m alive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you two ready?\u201d Jason called from outside the dressing room.</p><p>Carrie drew in a breath. \u201cReady as I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie handed her the bouquet and Carrie opened the door. Jason was working his black tie back and forth in an effort to loosen it. He stopped in midaction and his jaw sagged.</p><p>\u201cYou.....you look lovely.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t act so surprised,\u201d Carrie teased.</p><p>\u201cYou look so much like your mother on our wedding day, it\u2019s hard to believe. I can\u2019t get over it......\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie threw her a smile and hurried to join the wedding party for the procession down the aisle.</p><p>\u201cBe happy,\u201d Jason said, his voice suspiciously low. He tucked her hand in the crook of his arm.</p><p>When Carrie glanced his way, she noticed a sheen of tears in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll always be my daughter,\u201d he murmured, fidgeting with his tie again. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be prouder of you than I am right this minute.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Dad,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>They stood at the back of the church and waited for their cue, which came when Mendelssohn\u2019s \u201cWedding March\u201d began. Carrie took a step forward. Toward Philip. Toward love. Toward their life together.</p><p>THE PERFECT HOLIDAY</p><p>Sherryl Woods</p><p>Dear Friends,</p><p>Christmas is one of my very favorite times of the year. Any time I\u2019m asked to write a story about this season of joy and great hope, I\u2019m eager to do it. \u201cThe Perfect Holiday\u201d was written a few years ago, and I\u2019m absolutely delighted it\u2019s going to find a whole new audience in the company of two of my favorite authors, Debbie Macomber and Robyn Carr.</p><p>For many years now I\u2019ve spent my own holidays in Miami, which doesn\u2019t exactly fit the image of an ideal holiday setting. Yes, for you doubters, we do have Christmas here, but it\u2019s definitely not the white Christmas of my dreams. So where better to set a Christmas story than an inn in Vermont? Add in the workaholic owner of a toy factory who\u2019s never really learned how to play and a single mom struggling to get back on her feet. Then stir in a bit of matchmaking by a doting aunt\u2014from beyond the grave, no less\u2014and you have the makings of a very romantic holiday....the perfect holiday, in fact.</p><p>I hope you\u2019ll enjoy spending time with Savannah and Trace this holiday season, and that your own holidays will be touched by magic, as well.</p> <p>Merry Christmas to all!</p><p>One</p><p>\u201cMom, it\u2019s snowing,\u201d Hannah shouted from the living room.</p><p>Savannah heard the pounding of her daughter\u2019s footsteps on the wood floors, then the eight-year-old skidded to a stop in front of her, eyes shining.</p><p>\u201cCan I go outside? Please?\u201d Hannah begged. \u201cThis is so cool. I\u2019ve never seen snow before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Savannah told her, amused despite herself. \u201cWe don\u2019t get a lot of snow in Florida.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait till my friends back home hear we\u2019re going to have a white Christmas. It is so awesome. I am sooo glad we moved to Vermont.\u201d</p><p>Though she could understand her daughter\u2019s excited reaction to her first snowfall, from Savannah\u2019s perspective the snow was anything but a blessing. Since her arrival a couple of days ago, she\u2019d discovered that the furnace at Holiday Retreat wasn\u2019t reliable. The wind had a nasty way of sneaking in through all sorts of unexpected cracks in the insulation, and the roof\u2014well, the best she could say about that was that it hadn\u2019t fallen in on their heads.....yet. With the weight of a foot of damp snow on it, who knew what could happen?</p><p>It had been three weeks since the call had come from the attorney informing her that she was a beneficiary of her aunt Mae\u2019s estate. The bittersweet news had come the day before Thanksgiving, and for the first time since her divorce the year before, Savannah had thought she finally had something for which to be thankful besides her feisty, incredible daughter. Now that she\u2019d seen the inn, she was beginning to wonder if this wasn\u2019t just another of Fate\u2019s cruel jokes.</p><p>Holiday Retreat had been in the family for generations. Built in the early 1800s as a home for a wealthy ancestor, the huge, gracious house in the heart of Vermont ski country had become an inn when the family had fallen on hard times. Savannah could still remember coming here as a child and thinking it was like a Christmas fantasy, with the lights on the eaves and in the branches of the evergreens outside, a fire blazing in the living room and the aroma of banana-nut bread and cookies drifting from the kitchen. The tree, which they cut down themselves and decorated on Christmas Eve, always scraped the twelve-foot ceiling.</p><p>Aunt Mae\u2014Savannah\u2019s great-aunt actually\u2014had been in her prime then. A hearty fifty-something, she came from sturdy New England stock. She had bustled through the house making everyone in the family feel welcome, fixing elaborate meals effortlessly and singing carols boisterously, if a bit tunelessly. It was the one time of the year when there were no paying guests at the inn\u2014just aunts and uncles and cousins all gathered for holiday festivities. To an only child like Savannah, the atmosphere had seemed magical.</p><p>If the house had been in a state of disrepair then and if the furniture had been shabby, she hadn\u2019t noticed it. Now it promised to be one of the world\u2019s worst money pits.</p><p>\u201cMom, did you hear me?\u201d Hannah said again. \u201cI said it\u2019s snowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard,\u201d Savannah said glumly.</p><p>Hannah\u2019s blue eyes were alight with excitement. \u201cIsn\u2019t it great?\u201d</p><p>Savannah tried to work up some enthusiasm to match her daughter\u2019s, but all she could think about was the probability that too much snow would make the sagging roof plummet down on top of their heads as they slept. Still, she forced a smile.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like a white Christmas,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cCan we get a tree and make hot chocolate and sing carols like you used to do when you were a kid?\u201d Hannah pleaded. \u201cThen it won\u2019t matter if we don\u2019t have any presents.\u201d</p><p>Savannah cringed at the realistic assessment of their financial plight. The divorce had left her with next to nothing. Her ex-husband hadn\u2019t yet been persuaded to send even the paltry child support payments required by the court. As for alimony, she had a hunch hell would freeze over before she saw a penny of that. Since their divorce had hinged on her objections to his workaholic tendencies, Rob clearly saw no reason she should benefit from the income derived from those tendencies.</p><p>Last night, after Hannah had gone to bed, Savannah had sat for hours with her checkbook, a pile of final bills from Florida and a list of the repairs needed before the inn could be opened to paying guests in the new year. Her conclusion had left her feeling more despondent than ever. It was going to take more than a glistening snowfall and a few carols to brighten her spirits.</p><p>No matter how hard she tried telling herself that they were better off than they had been, she still wasn\u2019t totally convinced. Maybe if they\u2019d stayed in Florida, she would have found a better-paying job, something that wouldn\u2019t have left them scraping by after making house payments and buying groceries. At least they wouldn\u2019t have had to worry about the kind of exorbitant heating bill from last winter that she\u2019d found in a kitchen drawer here. Maybe selling the heavily mortgaged house that had been her home with Rob had been another error in judgment. It had given her barely enough cash to make the trip and to make a start on the repairs the inn needed.</p><p>\u201cMom, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Hannah asked. \u201cAre you afraid we made a mistake?\u201d</p><p>Seeing the concern that filled her daughter\u2019s eyes and the worried crease in her forehead, Savannah shook off her fears. Hannah deserved better than the hand she\u2019d been dealt up to now. For the first time since the divorce, she was acting like a kid again. Savannah refused to let her own worries steal that from her daughter.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cI think coming here was exactly the right thing to do. We\u2019re going to make it work. How many people get to live in a place that looks like a picture on a Christmas card?\u201d</p><p>She gave her daughter a fierce hug. \u201cHow about some hot chocolate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen can we go out in the snow?\u201d Hannah pleaded.</p><p>\u201cTell you what\u2014why don\u2019t you bundle up in your new winter jacket and go outside for a few minutes so you can see what it feels like? I\u2019ll call you when the hot chocolate\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>Hannah shook her head. \u201cNo, Mom, I want you to come, too. Please.\u201d</p><p>Savannah thought of all she had to do, then dismissed it. It was only a few days till Christmas. Most of the contractors she\u2019d spoken to said they couldn\u2019t come by till after the first of the year. Until she and Hannah made a trip into the small town at the foot of the mountain, she couldn\u2019t strip the old wallpaper or paint. Why not think of this as an unexpected gift of time?</p><p>\u201cOkay, kiddo, let\u2019s do it,\u201d she said, grabbing her coat off a hook by the door. \u201cOnly for a few minutes, though. We\u2019re going to need some heavy boots, wool scarves and thick gloves before we spend much time outside. We don\u2019t want to start the new year with frostbite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Hannah said, tugging her out the door, seemingly oblivious to the blast of icy air that greeted them and froze their breath.</p><p>There was an inch of damp, heavy snow on the ground and clinging to the towering evergreens already, and it was still falling steadily. With no chains or snow tires on the car, they\u2019d be lucky if they got out of the driveway for a couple of days, Savannah concluded, sinking back into gloominess.</p><p>Then she caught the awed expression on Hannah\u2019s face as she tilted her head up and caught snowflakes on her tongue. She remembered doing the exact same thing the first time she\u2019d visited Aunt Mae and seen snow. She\u2019d been even younger than Hannah, and for several years the Christmas trips to Vermont had been the highlight of her life. She couldn\u2019t recall why they\u2019d stopped coming as a family.</p><p>She\u2019d come on her own several times after she was grown, but those visits had dwindled off when she\u2019d met, then married, Rob. He was a Florida boy through and through and flatly refused to visit anyplace where the temperature dropped below the midfifties.</p><p>Now that Aunt Mae was gone, Savannah deeply regretted not having done more than write an occasional letter enclosing pictures of Hannah. Her aunt had never once judged her, though, and she\u2019d been totally supportive when Savannah had told her about the breakup of her marriage. She\u2019d sent one check explained away as a birthday gift and offered more, but Savannah had turned her down. She\u2019d lied and said they were getting along okay, but she knew now that her aunt had seen through her. She had done in death what Savannah hadn\u2019t permitted her to do while she was living. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If other members of her family resented the gesture, Savannah didn\u2019t know about it. She\u2019d lost touch with most of them years ago. She\u2019d been estranged from her parents ever since she\u2019d divorced a man of whom they enthusiastically approved. Aunt Mae had tried to broker a peace agreement between Savannah and her father, but he\u2019d remained stubbornly silent and unyielding. He\u2019d been convinced Savannah was a fool for divorcing a man who brought home a steady paycheck.</p><p>\u201cMom, I love it here!\u201d Hannah announced, throwing her arms around Savannah. She was shivering even in her heavy coat. \u201cI want to build a snowman. Can we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll need a little more snow than this,\u201d Savannah told her. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m freezing. How about that hot chocolate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to stay out here. I\u2019m not cold,\u201d Hannah insisted.</p> <p>\u201cThen why are your teeth chattering?\u201d Savannah teased. \u201cCome on, baby. Even if you won\u2019t admit to freezing, I will. There will be more snow once we\u2019ve warmed up. I\u2019ll teach you how to make snow angels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are snow angels?\u201d Hannah asked, her interest immediately piqued.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see. Aunt Mae taught me when I was a little girl. Now come inside and get warm.\u201d</p><p>Far more agreeable lately than she had been for months, Hannah finally acquiesced, following Savannah into the kitchen. Savannah studied her daughter\u2019s sparkling eyes, pink cheeks and tousled hair and knew she\u2019d done the right thing, no matter what struggles might lie ahead.</p><p>Despite the sad state of the inn, they were going to have the fresh beginning they both deserved, she decided with a surge of determination. And it was going to start with the very best Christmas Hannah had ever had, even if she was going to have to do it on a shoestring. Some of her very best holiday memories had cost nothing.</p> <p>As for the practicalities\u2014the repairs, the marketing plan she needed to devise\u2014they would just have to wait for the new year.</p><p>Mae Holiday had been one of the most eccentric people Trace Franklin had ever known. He had met her when he\u2019d been dragged to Vermont for an idyllic summer getaway by one of the women he\u2019d dated. That had been eight or nine years ago. Twice that number of women had passed through his life since then. Of them all, the one he hadn\u2019t dated\u2014Mae\u2014had been the most memorable.</p><p>She\u2019d been the grandmother he\u2019d never had, the mentor who tried her best to bring some balance into his life. Until the day she\u2019d died at seventy-eight, it had frustrated her no end that she hadn\u2019t managed to convince him that romance was just as important as money.</p><p>Trace knew better. His parents had been madly in love, but it hadn\u2019t brought either one of them a blasted thing except heartache. Love had kept his mother with a man who never had two nickels to rub together, a man whose big killing was always \u201cjust around the corner.\u201d</p><p>While John Franklin had spun his dreams, his wife had cleaned houses, worked in fast-food chains and, finally, when it was almost too late to matter, gotten a steady job selling toys to families that could afford to give their kids elaborate backyard swing sets and fancy computer games.</p><p>When Trace was fifteen, his mom had brought one of those games home to him, but by then he\u2019d been way past playing childish games. He\u2019d been working with single-minded focus on graduating from high school with honors and getting a scholarship to the best college in the state. He didn\u2019t want to play with toys. He wanted to own a whole blasted toy company.</p> <p>And now he did. The irony, which Mae had seen right away, was that he still didn\u2019t have time to play. He wasn\u2019t even sure he knew how.</p><p>He was driving along the snow-covered roads of Vermont right now because of Mae. On his last visit to see her at the end of October, she had made a final request. She had known she was dying, had known it for fully a year before the cancer had finally taken her, but she hadn\u2019t said a word to Trace until that last visit when she had detailed her losing battle, reciting the facts with a stoicism and acceptance that had awed him.</p><p>\u201cI want you to promise me something,\u201d she had said as they\u2019d sat in front of the fire on his last night there. Despite the heat of the blaze, she\u2019d been wrapped in blankets, and still she had shivered.</p><p>\u201cAnything,\u201d Trace had responded, and meant it. Not only was Mae one of the earliest investors and biggest stockholders in Franklin Toys, she was his friend.</p><p>\u201cI want you to spend Christmas here at Holiday Retreat.\u201d</p><p>It was only a couple of months away and it would require some juggling of his schedule, but there was no question that he would do it. \u201cOf course I will,\u201d he said at once. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a wonderful time.\u201d</p><p>She had squeezed his hand. \u201cI won\u2019t be here, Trace. You know that.\u201d</p><p>Even now, the memory of that moment brought the sharp sting of tears to his eyes. Her gaze had been unrelenting. From the beginning of her illness, she had refused to sugarcoat the truth to herself. Now that she was revealing it to others, she expected them to face it, as well. The cancer had spread too far and too fast before the doctors had had the first inkling there was anything wrong. She was dying and there was going to be no reprieve.</p> <p>Trace had returned her unflinching gaze, heartbroken yet unable to face her death with less bravery than she was showing. \u201cWhy, Mae? Why would you want me here after you\u2019re gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do it for me,\u201d she whispered, her voice fading. \u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d he\u2019d said just as her eyes drifted closed. He\u2019d been willing to do anything that would give her comfort. He owed her that much, and more.</p><p>Two weeks later Mae Holiday had died peacefully, a lifelong friend\u2014a man she had loved deeply but never married\u2014by her side. Now Trace was on his way to Vermont to pay his respects....and to keep his promise.</p><p>Two</p><p>There was smoke curling from the chimney at Holiday Retreat. Lights were blazing from the downstairs windows. Trace sat in his car and stared, trying to make sense of it. He\u2019d expected to spend the Christmas holiday alone here, mourning Mae in private, reliving the happy times they\u2019d spent together over the years they\u2019d known each other.</p><p>And, he conceded with a rueful grimace, catching up on the mounds of paperwork he\u2019d brought with him, along with his cell phone, laptop computer and fax machine.</p><p>What the dickens was going on? he wondered, thoroughly disgruntled by this turn of events. Mae had said nothing about anyone else being here. Nor had the attorney in the note that had accompanied a key to the inn. The note had merely advised that Mae had seen to having plenty of food and firewood on hand and that she hoped his visit would be a memorable one. If he had any problems, he was to contact Nate Daniels, the man Trace had heard of, but never met, the man who was the shadowy love of Mae\u2019s life.</p><p>Trace fingered the old-fashioned key in his pocket as he walked through the foot or so of recently accumulated snow. He was halfway to the door when he spotted indentations, a hectic swirl of footsteps and something else. He looked more closely and saw.....not one but two snow angels, the sort made by flopping down in new-fallen snow and moving outstretched arms to create wings.</p><p>At first the sight brought a smile, reminding him of innocent, long-ago days as a kid before the unpredictability of the family\u2019s day-to-day existence had registered with him. Winters back home had been relatively mild, so that rare snowfalls had been regarded with sheer delight. He hadn\u2019t owned a sled, but he\u2019d had his share of snowball fights and made more than a few snow angels.</p><p>Then the full implication of the snow angels sank in, and pleasant memories gave way to edginess. Judging from the smaller size of one snow angel, there was a kid on the premises and that generally meant noisy chaos, the last thing he\u2019d anticipated when he\u2019d made the commitment to Mae to spend the Christmas holidays here. For a man who made his living by providing expensive hobbies and toys to children, Trace was amazingly uneasy when confronted with an individual child. For him, toys were a multimillion-dollar business, not entertainment. Unless he could persuade himself to use whatever child was around to conduct market research, this whole situation had just gone from bad to worse.</p><p>He was about to turn tail and run, but then he heard Mae\u2019s voice in his head as she\u2019d extracted that promise from him. He\u2019d never gone back on his word to her, ever. He wasn\u2019t about to start now.</p><p>Filled with a sense of dread, he made his way to the front door. He stood on the slick porch debating whether to ring the bell, rather than walking in on whomever was here. Then again, he had just as much right to be here as the unknown occupant did. More, perhaps. That remained to be seen.</p><p>He stuck the key in the lock, turned it and pushed open the heavy door, noting as he did that it was in serious need of paint. It had once been bright red, as had all the shutters on the house. Now it was faded to a shade only slightly deeper than pink. Maybe he\u2019d take care of that while he was here. It would be a fitting homage to Mae to see the doors and shutters restored to their scarlet holiday brilliance.</p><p>He was about to close the door when a girl\u2014just about the size of the snow angel outside, he noted\u2014skidded to a stop in front of him on one of the scooters his company made. It had been the hottest gift of the holiday season two years ago. It was not meant to be used indoors, though he could understand the temptation given the wide expanse of hardwood floors. And it wasn\u2019t as if those floors were in particularly great shape. They could do with sanding and a fresh coat of wax. Something else he could do while he was here.....in Mae\u2019s memory.</p><p>First, though, he had to figure out who was this imp of a child regarding him with blatant curiosity, her golden hair scooped through the opening of a baseball cap, her T-shirt half in and half out of her jeans.</p><p>\u201cWho are you and what are you doing here?\u201d he demanded in the no-nonsense tone he used on executives who\u2019d failed to deliver on their division\u2019s projections.</p><p>The kid didn\u2019t even flinch. \u201cI\u2019m Hannah and I live here. Who are you? And how come you have a key to my house?\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s head began to throb. What the devil was Mae up to? \u201cAre your parents here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust my mom. My dad divorced us. He lives in Florida. My mom\u2019s baking Christmas cookies.\u201d She cast an appealing smile at him. \u201cDon\u2019t they smell great?\u201d</p><p>Trace automatically sniffed the air. They did smell fantastic, just the way Mae\u2019s always had. He\u2019d eaten fancier food than what was served at Holiday Retreat, but he\u2019d never had any that tasted better or was prepared with more love. He wondered if Hannah\u2019s mom shared Mae\u2019s talents in the kitchen, then sighed. That was hardly the point.</p><p>\u201cWant me to get my mom?\u201d Hannah inquired.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find her,\u201d Trace said, heading determinedly toward the kitchen. He\u2019d taken only a step before he turned back. \u201cBy the way, that scooter is not an indoor toy.\u201d</p><p>The kid\u2019s smile never faltered. \u201cMaybe not, but it works great in here.\u201d And off she went, completely unimpressed by his admonishment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trace sighed and went in search of her mother.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what he expected, but it certainly wasn\u2019t the frail wisp of a woman who was bent over in an incredibly provocative pose, her head stuck halfway into the huge, professional-quality stainless-steel oven that had been Mae\u2019s pride and joy.</p><p>This room was where Mae had splurged, spending her money to design a kitchen that was both welcoming and efficient. Everything in it, from the refrigerator to the granite countertops, was top-of-the-line. When she had shown it to Trace a few years ago, she\u2019d been as excited as a kid on Christmas morning. She told him it was how she\u2019d spent her first dividends from her stock in Franklin Toys.</p><p>And now there was an interloper in here, he thought, feeling oddly possessive on Mae\u2019s behalf. Unless this woman could prove her right to be on the premises, Trace would have her packed up and out of here before nightfall, even if he had to call on local law enforcement to toss her out on her attractive backside.</p> <p>Despite his impatience to accomplish that task, and rather than risk scaring her half to death while she was that close to incinerating herself, he waited, barely resisting the desire to haul her out of there immediately and demand an explanation for her presence.</p><p>Of course, he was also having some difficulty resisting the urge to smooth his hand over that narrow curve of her denim-clad bottom. That, he concluded, was a very dangerous temptation. He admonished himself to forget it the same way he\u2019d scolded Hannah only moments earlier. He hoped he paid more attention to the warning than she had, since there was likely a lot more at stake than scarred floorboards.</p><p>The woman finally retreated, holding a tray almost as big as she was. As she turned to set it on the granite countertop, she spotted him and let go of the tray with a yelp of surprise. Trace caught it in midair, then let out a curse of his own as the hot metal seared his fingers. He dropped the tray with a clatter. Cookies went flying. And the woman regarded him as if he were a living, breathing embodiment of Scrooge and he\u2019d deliberately set out to ruin her Christmas.</p><p>\u201cLook what you\u2019ve done,\u201d she said, scowling at him as she bent to pick up the broken remains of sugar cookies decorated with pretty red and green designs. She waved a hatless Santa with half a beard under Trace\u2019s nose. \u201cJust look at this.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t seem one bit concerned with the fact that he\u2019d burned himself trying to save her blasted cookies. He stepped past her and stuck his hands under cold running water. That finally got her attention.</p> <p>\u201cOh, fudge, you burned yourself, didn\u2019t you?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat was I thinking? I\u2019m sorry. Here, let me see.\u201d</p><p>She nudged up against him and grabbed his hand. Her touch was anything but soothing. In fact, now Trace was suddenly burning on the inside, too.</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d she ordered before he could unscramble his thoughts. \u201cThere\u2019s a first-aid kit around here somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCabinet next to the stove,\u201d Trace told her, blowing on his fingers.</p><p>She stopped and stared. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMae was always getting distracted and having little accidents in the kitchen. She said it paid to keep the bandages close at hand.\u201d</p> <p>Rather than fetching the first-aid supplies, the woman sank down onto a chair, her eyes promptly filling with unshed tears. \u201cShe did say that, didn\u2019t she?\u201d she whispered. \u201cI must have heard her say it a hundred times. And even before she remodeled in here, she kept aloe and antiseptic spray and bandages right by the stove.\u201d</p><p>Trace was startled by the depth of emotion in this stranger\u2019s voice. Her love for Mae was written all over her face. That much raw pain was more than he knew how to deal with; his own emotions were shaky enough. He stepped carefully around her and got his own ointment and bandages, using the time to collect himself and try to fill with renewed resolve the tiny chink she\u2019d created in his desire to be rid of her.</p><p>When he was finished repairing the damage to his hand, he finally risked another look at her. The color had returned to her cheeks, but there was no mistaking the signs of a woman on the edge. He\u2019d seen that same stressed expression often enough on his mother\u2019s face, the same tightness around the mouth, the wariness in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked at last.</p><p>She nodded, still blinking back tears. \u201cSometimes it just catches me off guard, the fact that she\u2019s gone. I hadn\u2019t seen her in several years, but I always had such wonderful memories of being here, especially around the holidays.\u201d</p><p>That must have been a long time ago, Trace thought with a surprising surge of anger on Mae\u2019s behalf. He\u2019d been here with Mae every year since that trip when they\u2019d first met. He\u2019d never been entirely sure how she\u2019d cajoled him into coming, but year after year he\u2019d found himself driving north from New York City, looking forward to spending time with the closest thing he had to family now that his folks were both dead.</p><p>Oddly, on none of those trips had he ever caught a glimpse of the man in Mae\u2019s life. Only at the end had she explained why, that Nate had his own family responsibilities, duties that he had never once shirked through all the years they had loved each other. It had been an unconventional love\u2014an impossible love\u2014she had explained to Trace. The man\u2019s wife had suffered a nervous breakdown years before, when his children were little more than toddlers. Nate could never bring himself to divorce her during all the long, lonely years when he\u2019d struggled as a single dad, watching his wife\u2019s mind deteriorate degree by degree. He had been the rock that held his family together.....and the other half of Mae\u2019s soul. If she regretted anything about their long, secret affair, she never once complained of it to Trace. And it had certainly never soured her on the possibilities of romance.</p><p>It was little wonder, though, that Mae had sought out Trace\u2019s company around the holidays, he had realized as she told him the story. The loneliness at a season meant for sharing with family and friends must have been unbearable. Trace wondered if this woman even knew about that part of Mae\u2019s life.</p> <p>\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been here for years, why are you here now?\u201d Trace asked, unable to hide the note of bitterness in his voice. \u201cDid you come to pick over her belongings?\u201d</p><p>She seemed startled by the hostility in the question\u2014or maybe by the fact that he thought he had the right to ask it. \u201cI\u2019m here because my aunt left Holiday Retreat to me,\u201d she said eventually. \u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business, but I\u2019m Savannah Holiday. Mae was my grandfather\u2019s sister. And you are? How did you get in here, anyway?\u201d She sighed. \u201cHannah, I suppose. I\u2019ve told her and told her about not opening the door to strangers.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t seem to occur to Savannah Holiday that it had taken her a long time to get around to asking about his identity. In New York, the police would probably have been called the second he appeared in the kitchen doorway and the answers to all those questions could have been sorted out later.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Trace Franklin,\u201d he said. \u201cA friend of Mae\u2019s.\u201d He retrieved the key from his pocket and plunked it on the table where it glinted in the sunlight. \u201cAnd I got in with this, though I did see your daughter as I came in.\u201d</p><p>She stared at the key. \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom your aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would she give you a key to Holiday Retreat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019d invited me here for the holidays.\u201d He was only now beginning to grasp just how diabolical that invitation had been. His finding the alluring Savannah Holiday and her daughter underfoot was clearly no accident, but Mae\u2019s last-ditch effort at matchmaking. He wondered if Savannah Holiday had figured out what her aunt was up to.</p><p>He regarded his unexpected housemate with a wry expression. \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>Compared to the man sitting across from her with his cool, flinty gaze and designer wardrobe, Savannah felt like a dowdy waif. She was pretty sure there was flour in her hair and, more than likely, red and green sprinkles on her nose. When it came to baking, she did it with more enthusiasm than tidiness or expertise. The results were equally unpredictable, though she\u2019d been particularly proud of the batch of golden cookies that were currently lying in crumbles around her feet.</p><p>She regarded this interloper with caution, in part at least because his presence rattled her. She\u2019d felt a little flicker of awareness the instant he\u2019d entered the kitchen. At first she\u2019d attributed it to surprise, but then she\u2019d realized it was a whole lot more like the sensation she\u2019d experienced the first time she\u2019d met Rob. It was the caught-off-guard, heart-stopping reaction of a woman to a virile, attractive male.....or a doe when confronted by a rifle-toting hunter. She was stunned to discover that she was even remotely susceptible to a man after the bitterness of her divorce, especially to a man wearing the clothes of a business executive to a country inn. It was something her uptight ex-husband would have done.</p><p>Because her reaction made her uneasy, she focused on the one topic guaranteed to take her mind off it. \u201cYou said Mae invited you here. You do know that my aunt died, right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His expression was almost as bleak as the one Savannah saw in the mirror every morning. \u201cBut you came anyway,\u201d she said, impressed despite the instinct that told her this man was anything but sentimental.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what she wanted,\u201d he said simply. \u201cI promised I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you always keep your promises?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t make that many, and the ones I do make mean something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your family? Won\u2019t they miss you over the holidays?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn recent years Mae was the closest thing I had to family. What about your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannah\u2019s here. For all intents and purposes, she\u2019s all I have. My husband and I divorced a year ago.\u201d She hesitated, then added, \u201cMy parents and I aren\u2019t on speaking terms at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>She was grateful that he didn\u2019t bombard her with a lot of questions about that. \u201cHow did you know Mae? Forgive me, but you don\u2019t look as if you spend a lot of time in the country.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that, and it transformed his face. The tight lines around his mouth eased. His dark eyes sparkled. \u201cWhat gave me away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe clothes, for starters. I\u2019m amazed you stayed upright walking from the car to the house in those shoes. I don\u2019t think snow is kind to Italian leather. And I can\u2019t imagine that you\u2019d be able to spend more than a few minutes outdoors before freezing in that shirt. Men around here tend toward flannel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I think the real secret is what they wear under it,\u201d he said, barely containing what promised to be a wicked grin.</p><p>Savannah\u2019s thoughts automatically veered off in a very dangerous direction. She had the oddest desire to strip off his clothes to see if there were practical long johns underneath. She\u2019d never thought that sort of men\u2019s underwear to be particularly sexy, but she imagined Trace Franklin could do amazing things for the look. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re blushing,\u201d he said, regarding her with amusement.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course I am! I hardly know you, and here we are discussing underwear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can be a fascinating topic, especially if we move from cotton to satin and lace.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cYou\u2019re deliberately trying to rattle me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d he asked, trying for a serious expression. The twinkle in his gray eyes betrayed him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine, especially when all I was trying to find out was what drew a city man like you to spend time in a country retreat.\u201d She studied him thoughtfully, then said, \u201cThere must have been a woman involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBingo. The woman who brought me here years ago was envisioning a quiet, romantic getaway with long hikes through the woods.\u201d He shrugged and gave her a beguilingly sheepish look. \u201cInstead I spent the weekend holed up in Mae\u2019s study with my computer and fax machine taking care of a business crisis.\u201d</p><p>Savannah immediately felt a surprising empathy for the woman. \u201cNow, that I can imagine. Your friend must have been disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDreadfully.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat sort of business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI own a company in New York,\u201d he said in such a dismissive way that it sparked her curiosity.</p><p>\u201cFranklin,\u201d Savannah recalled thoughtfully. \u201cNot Franklin Toys, by any chance?\u201d</p><p>He seemed startled that she\u2019d grasped it so quickly. \u201cThat\u2019s the one. How on earth did you figure that out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were some articles about that company on Mae\u2019s desk. Obviously she kept up with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine so,\u201d he said, his expression noncommittal.</p> <p>\u201cBecause she knew you from your visits here?\u201d Savannah persisted, sensing there was more.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThat was the start of her interest, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at his evasiveness. \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m leaving something out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInstinct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then, here\u2019s the whole story in a nutshell. I suppose I owe you that, since I\u2019ve shown up on your doorstep out of the blue,\u201d he said. \u201cYour aunt was the one who encouraged me to start the company. I\u2019d been with another toy manufacturer for a few years. I\u2019d learned all I could, and I had a lot of ideas for ways to do it better. Mae was an early investor in Franklin Toys. Over the years she and I made a lot of money together, but I owe every bit of that success to her initial encouragement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Savannah said slowly. \u201cSo that first trip here wasn\u2019t a waste of your time after all. Did your relationship with the woman last?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly for as long as it took me to get her back to her apartment in New York that Sunday night,\u201d he said with no hint of regret. \u201cMy friendship with Mae lasted much longer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you came back here often?\u201d she asked, feeling a vague sense of regret and guilt that he\u2019d spent these last years with her aunt, when she should have been the one spending time here.</p><p>\u201cAs frequently as I could,\u201d he said. \u201cYour aunt was a remarkable woman. I enjoyed my visits with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if she did live essentially in the middle of nowhere,\u201d Savannah said, needing to remind herself that this man bore way too many resemblances to her ex-husband.</p><p>\u201cFunny thing about that,\u201d he said, picking up one of the few sugar cookies they\u2019d managed to salvage and breaking off a bite. \u201cI got used to the peace and quiet. And the phone lines, fax and Internet connections work just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo even though you\u2019re here for the holidays, I suppose you brought all of your equipment along,\u201d she guessed.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Savannah shook her head. \u201cI hope you watch your cholesterol. Anybody who\u2019s as much of a workaholic as you appear to be is clearly a heart attack waiting to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try not to have one while I\u2019m here,\u201d he promised solemnly.</p><p>\u201cThank you for that. I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have the kind of insurance it would take to cover your medical expenses if you collapse and fall down the stairs.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, I suppose you can stay,\u201d she said grudgingly, thinking of the extra work involved in having a guest in a house that was all but falling down around them.</p><p>He regarded her with a wry expression. \u201cI had no intention of doing anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to pitch in and help,\u201d she said, deliberately ignoring his remark. \u201cI\u2019m afraid the inn isn\u2019t officially ready for guests again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a guest\u2014not the way you mean, anyway. And I came expecting to take care of myself. The attorney said the refrigerator would be stocked, and I brought along plenty of food from the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaviar, I imagine,\u201d she said, feeling strangely testy at the thought of sharing the house with a man whose tastes, like Rob\u2019s, probably ran to the expensive and exotic. \u201cMaybe some imported Stilton cheese? Smoked salmon? The finer things you absolutely couldn\u2019t live without?\u201d</p><p>His grin spread. \u201cJunk food, if you must know.\u201d</p><p>Once again, Savannah felt the full effects of that devastating smile. She hoped he wouldn\u2019t do it too often. It might make her forget that he was completely unsuitable for a woman who\u2019d already been burned by a man who put his work before his family.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly do you consider junk food?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cPotato chips. Popcorn.\u201d He leaned closer and lowered his voice to confide, \u201cI also have a cooler filled with chocolate mocha almond ice cream. I\u2019m addicted to the stuff.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. Chocolate mocha almond was an indulgence she rarely allowed herself. Aside from the calories, the brand she loved was outrageously expensive. She\u2019d developed a taste for it during her marriage, but had had to forgo it since the divorce. The store brands simply didn\u2019t live up to the gourmet ice cream. She had a hunch that cooler of Trace\u2019s was stocked with the best.</p><p>\u201cExactly how much ice cream did you bring?\u201d she asked, hoping it sounded like a purely casual inquiry.</p><p>\u201cEnough for you and Hannah.....if you\u2019re good,\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to chocolate mocha almond, I can eat a lot,\u201d she warned him.</p><p>He surveyed her slowly, appreciatively, then shook his head. \u201cNot as much as I can,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I brought enough for a week. I\u2019ll make you a deal. If you let me share in whatever you\u2019re fixing for Christmas dinner, I\u2019ll provide dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s three days away,\u201d Savannah protested.</p><p>He winked. \u201cI know. Patience is a virtue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother of Mae\u2019s favorite sayings,\u201d Savannah recalled as again a wave of nostalgia hit. \u201cAre you sure I can\u2019t talk you into sharing sooner?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the piles of cookies on the table and the obvious remnants of hot chocolate in two mugs. \u201cAre you absolutely certain you won\u2019t go into some sort of sugar-overload crisis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll bring it in,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d Savannah said eagerly, grabbing a jacket off a hook by the door and following him outside.</p><p>The instant she spotted his fancy new four-wheel-drive sports utility vehicle out front, she was momentarily distracted from thoughts of ice cream. It could turn out that Trace Franklin was the answer to her prayers.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d be willing to let me borrow your car?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFirst you want my ice cream, and now you\u2019re after my car,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cYou ask a lot for someone I\u2019ve barely met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to get to town to pick up paint and things to start on the work that\u2019s needed around here.\u201d She glanced toward her own car, a faded six-year-old sedan with questionable tires. \u201cI doubt my car will make it down the mountain, much less back up on these icy roads.\u201d</p><p>His expression grew thoughtful. \u201cOkay, here\u2019s my best offer. I\u2019ll trade you breakfast tomorrow for a trip into town.\u201d</p><p>Apparently the man\u2019s obsession with business never quit. \u201cYou really do like to negotiate, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cForce of habit. I like creating win-win situations. Is it a deal?\u201d</p><p>Savannah held out her hand. \u201cDeal.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cYou could have dinner with Hannah and me this evening, if you like. It won\u2019t be fancy. I\u2019m fixing spaghetti.\u201d</p><p>He seemed startled by the invitation. \u201cIt just so happens that I love spaghetti.\u201d His gaze narrowed suspiciously. \u201cWhat do you want in return for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIce cream for dessert?\u201d she asked hopefully.</p><p>Rather than answering, he reached into the car, then turned back with something in hand and tossed it to her. Savannah caught it instinctively. It was a pint of ice cream. And she\u2019d been right\u2014it was the best.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all yours,\u201d he said. \u201cConsider it a gesture of good faith.\u201d</p><p>He retrieved a huge cooler, which obviously contained the rest. Savannah eyed it enviously. \u201cIs that thing really filled with more of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPacked solid,\u201d he told her. He studied her warily. \u201cAm I going to have to put a lock on the freezer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never steal your ice cream,\u201d she said with a hint of indignation, then grinned. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t try to talk you out of it.\u201d</p><p>His gaze locked with hers and anticipation slid over her once again, making her senses come alive.</p><p>\u201cThis is really, really good ice cream,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cIt could take more than talk.\u201d</p><p>Savannah barely resisted the urge to fan herself. She was surprised steam wasn\u2019t rising around her. Oh, this man was dangerous, all right. She was obviously going to have to watch her step the whole time he was underfoot. Any man who prided himself on being a shark when it came to business was likely to be equally determined when it came to anything else he wanted.</p><p>Well, she\u2019d just have to make sure he didn\u2019t decide he wanted her. One glance comparing her flour-streaked jeans to his tailored wool slacks put that notion to rest. They weren\u2019t in the same league at all.</p><p>She lifted her gaze to his, caught the desire darkening those gray eyes. Uh-oh, she thought. Apparently clothes didn\u2019t matter to Trace, because the look in his eyes was anything but neutral.</p><p>More worrisome, though, than that discovery was the realization that she wasn\u2019t nearly as upset by it as she probably ought to be. In fact, a little zing of anticipation had her blood heating up quite nicely. She could probably strip off her sheepskin-lined jacket and be quite comfortable in the twenty-degree temperature out here.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll want to get all your stuff inside,\u201d she said, her tone suddenly brisk. \u201cWho knows how many deals you might have missed while we\u2019ve been talking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ones worth making can always wait,\u201d he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStill, I\u2019d hate to feel responsible for you missing out on something important. Besides, I promised Hannah that she and I would go cut down a Christmas tree this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>He regarded her as if she\u2019d just mentioned a plan to cut down the entire forest.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a perfectly good tree lot in town. I passed it on my way out here,\u201d he said. \u201cThose trees are already cut. Less work. Less waste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that an expression of environmental concern?\u201d she inquired. \u201cBecause the trees I\u2019m talking about are grown specifically for the holidays. It\u2019s how some people make their living.\u201d</p> <p>He looked skeptical. \u201cStill seems like a lot of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this is a tradition,\u201d she countered.</p><p>He looked as if she\u2019d used a foreign term.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you have any holiday traditions when you were growing up?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said at once. \u201cStaying out from underfoot while Mom and Dad argued over how much money was being wasted on presents.\u201d</p> <p>Savannah couldn\u2019t imagine a home in which the holidays had meant anything other than a joyful celebration. For all of the problems she and her parents were having now, they had given her years of memories of idyllic Christmases. Very little of that had had anything at all to do with the materialistic things. It had been about family togetherness, laughter.....traditions. For some reason, she suddenly wanted to share just a little of that with this man to whom tradition meant so little. She\u2019d never been able to get through to Rob, but maybe Trace Franklin wasn\u2019t a lost cause.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to help us?\u201d she asked impulsively.</p><p>He looked even more disconcerted by that invitation than he had been by her request that he join them for dinner. \u201cI had planned to get some work done this afternoon,\u201d he said predictably.</p><p>\u201cSurely the company founder can take a break for a couple of hours,\u201d she coaxed. \u201cMost people do relax around the holidays. I doubt anyone will be too upset if they don\u2019t get a fax today or even tomorrow. Some people might actually be hoping to leave work early to finish their holiday shopping.\u201d</p><p>A vaguely guilty expression passed across his face, as if he\u2019d already forgotten that Christmas was only a few days away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said eventually. \u201cThe work can wait. In fact, maybe I\u2019ll call my secretary and tell her to let everyone leave early.\u201d</p> <p>Savannah grinned at the unexpected evidence that Scrooge had a heart. \u201cThat\u2019s the spirit,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll get my coat and hurry Hannah along. You\u2019d better change into something warmer, too. My hunch is that this could take a long time. Hannah rushes through most things, but she\u2019s never made a quick decision about a Christmas tree in her life.\u201d</p><p>As Savannah left Trace to finish putting his groceries away, she was all too aware that his gaze followed her as she exited from the kitchen. And that she unconsciously put a little extra sway in her hips because of it.</p><p>Oh, so what? she thought as a guilty blush crept into her cheeks. If she could grant Hannah\u2019s not-so-secret Christmas fantasy of a pair of skis, then surely Fate wouldn\u2019t mind granting her the chance to flirt with a handsome man for a couple of days. After the holidays, what were the chances she\u2019d ever see Trace again? Slim to none, more than likely. He was the perfect guy on which to practice a little harmless flirting. She had to get back into the dating game one of these days. Here was her chance to relearn the rules with a man who absolutely, positively was not her type, and better yet, a man who wouldn\u2019t be around long enough to break her heart.</p><p>Then she recalled that desire she\u2019d read in Trace\u2019s eyes only moments before. Harmless was not the first word that came to mind. Okay, she concluded, wicked would be nice, too.</p><p>Four</p><p>Trace hauled all of his business equipment into Mae\u2019s den, but before he could plug any of it in he was so overcome with emotion that he sank into the chair behind her antique desk and drew in a deep breath. As he did, he was almost certain he could still smell the soft, old-fashioned floral scent she had worn.</p><p>The room looked as if she\u2019d just left it moments earlier. A jar of her favorite gourmet jelly beans sat on the desk. He noted with amusement that most of the grape-flavored ones were gone. They had been her favorites, though she had claimed that she continued to buy assorted flavors precisely so she wouldn\u2019t get in a rut. She\u2019d never realized that Trace had added a half-pound or so of the grape-flavored jelly beans each and every time he came to visit, secretly stirring them into the mix.</p><p>The inn\u2019s guest book was still beside the phone with reservations carefully noted. He turned to today\u2019s date and saw his own name written in her graceful, flowing script. He saw that Savannah\u2019s arrival had been noted for a date only a few days earlier in a script that seemed less steady.</p> <p>Had she made those final arrangements for her niece\u2019s inheritance when she\u2019d known the end was near? Had she cleverly schemed to bring him together with Savannah even as her health was failing? It would have been just like her to plot something for those she loved, something to make them less lonely once she was gone.</p><p>Ironically he didn\u2019t think Savannah had picked up on the scheme yet. He\u2019d been the subject of so much matchmaking in recent years that he\u2019d seen what Mae was up to the instant he\u2019d realized he wasn\u2019t going to be alone at Holiday Retreat over the holidays. It was no accident that he and Savannah were here at the same time. Mae had wanted some of the seasonal magic to rub off on her heart-weary niece and a man she thought was missing out on romance.</p><p>So, why hadn\u2019t he run? He could have apologized for the intrusion and headed back to New York and the safety of his workaholic routine. It wasn\u2019t entirely duty to Mae that had kept him here but\u2014mostly, he had to admit\u2014the sweetly vulnerable Savannah herself. Though she wasn\u2019t complaining, it was obvious that her life hadn\u2019t been easy lately. Still, she\u2019d maintained an air of determination and her sense of humor. She was too unsophisticated to be his type, but there was something about her\u2014a fragility encased in steel\u2014that drew him just the same. It reminded him of a young man who\u2019d fled Tennessee years ago with little more than a dream and the determination to make it come true. And in many ways it reminded him of his mother, who\u2019d had the strength to endure poverty and hardship. Only in recent years\u2014after spending most of his youth condemning her for the choices she had made\u2014had he come to realize just how strong she had been.</p><p>\u201cTrace, are you ready yet?\u201d Savannah asked quietly, startling him. \u201cMy goodness, you\u2019re not even changed. Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>He met her concerned gaze. \u201cSorry. I got distracted.\u201d</p><p>Savannah came closer and perched on the edge of the desk. She regarded him with sympathy. \u201cYou feel her presence in here, don\u2019t you? I feel it most in the kitchen. It\u2019s like she\u2019s watching over my shoulder.\u201d A grin tugged at the corners of her mouth. \u201cMaking sure I don\u2019t burn the place down, more than likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have left the inn to you if she didn\u2019t trust you to take care of it,\u201d he told her, knowing with everything in him that it was true. Mae had been sentimental, but she had also had a practical streak. Her New England heritage, no doubt. \u201cThis place meant everything to her. When Franklin Toys started doing really well, I suggested she retire. She had plenty of money to live comfortably for the rest of her life. Know what she told me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat retirement was for people waiting to die,\u201d Savannah said. \u201cShe told me the same thing. She loved having her company, as she referred to the guests who came here year after year. She said they kept her young. What she missed was having family underfoot for the holidays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Hannah and I are here this year,\u201d Trace said, unable to keep a note of sorrow from his voice.</p><p>\u201cToo late,\u201d Savannah said, a tear sliding down her cheek.</p><p>Trace thought of his suspicions about Mae\u2019s reason for bringing them together. Not that he intended to get too carried away trying to see that all of her wish came true, but celebrating this Christmas with her niece was the least he could do for the woman who\u2019d believed in him.</p><p>\u201cYou said yourself that you think she\u2019s watching over you,\u201d he reminded Savannah. \u201cWhat makes you think she\u2019s not here right this second, gloating over having gotten us up here to celebrate the holiday and her memory at the same time?\u201d</p><p>Savannah\u2019s expression brightened. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right! Let\u2019s not disappoint her. We\u2019ll make this the most memorable holiday ever. We\u2019ll do everything just the way she used to do it, from the greens in the front hall to the candles on the mantel and in the windows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he said enthusiastically. \u201cGive me a minute to call my office and change, and I\u2019ll meet you and Hannah out front. We\u2019ll find the best tree on the tree farm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to be huge,\u201d Savannah warned.</p><p>He hesitated, phone receiver in hand. \u201cHow huge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, really big.\u201d She held her arms wide. \u201cAnd very, very tall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow were you and Hannah going to get such a huge tree back here by yourselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was counting on help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you didn\u2019t know I was coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Mr. Johnson has a truck. He also has a fondness for Mae\u2019s sugar cookies.\u201d</p><p>Trace winced. \u201cThe ones on the kitchen floor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are the ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink he\u2019ll accept any other sort of bribe?\u201d he asked, knowing that he was going to hate the alternative if Mr. Johnson declined to haul that tree.</p><p>\u201cNope. I think this tree is riding in your pristine, shiny SUV, shedding needles all the way,\u201d she said happily.</p><p>Trace groaned. \u201cI was afraid of that.\u201d</p><p>She patted his hand, sending a jolt of awareness through him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get a blanket to lay in the back,\u201d she said soothingly. \u201cNow, hurry, or you\u2019ll have Hannah to deal with. Trust me, she\u2019s worse than a nagging splinter when she\u2019s anxious to get someplace. Right now she\u2019s making a family of snow angels on the front lawn, but her enthusiasm for that will wear off shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hurry,\u201d Trace promised, unable to tear his gaze away as she left the room. He sighed, then dialed his office.</p><p>Two minutes later, he\u2019d told his stunned secretary to shut the company down until after the new year, changed into warmer clothes and was heading out the front door, only to be greeted by squeals of delight as Hannah upended her mother into a snowbank. Savannah was sputtering and scraping snow out of her mouth. There was a dangerous glint in her eyes as she regarded her traitorous daughter.</p><p>Oblivious to her mother\u2019s reaction, Hannah spotted Trace. Emboldened by her success with her mother, she raced in his direction. Trace braced for the hit. \u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t,\u201d he said, scooping her up when she would have tried to knock him on his backside. He held out a hand and helped Savannah up, even as Hannah tried to squirm free of his grip. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked into Savannah\u2019s dancing eyes. \u201cWhat do you think? Should I drop her in that snowdrift over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Hannah squealed. \u201cPut me down. I\u2019ll be good. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Trace kept his gaze on Savannah\u2019s. \u201cYour call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannah does keep her promises,\u201d she began thoughtfully. \u201cThen again, that snow was really, really cold. She needs to know that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know it. I know it,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cReally, Mom. I swear.\u201d</p><p>Before he realized what she intended, Savannah scooped up a handful of snow and rubbed her daughter\u2019s face with it, dribbling a fair amount inside the collar of his coat while she was at it. Accident? he wondered. Probably not.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Hannah squealed, laughing.</p><p>Savannah clapped her gloved hands together to get rid of the excess snow and regarded Trace with a pleased expression. \u201cI think it\u2019s okay to put her down now.\u201d</p><p>He lowered Hannah to her feet and caught her grin. \u201cI hope you learned a lesson,\u201d he said, fighting to keep his own expression somber.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she retorted just as seriously. \u201cI learned that my mom is very, very sneaky.\u201d</p><p>Trace nodded, shivering as the snow melted against his suddenly overheated skin. \u201cI caught that, too. What do you think we should do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Savannah protested, backing up a step. \u201cDon\u2019t you two even think about ganging up on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever dream of it,\u201d Trace said, winking at Hannah.</p><p>She winked back, then giggled. \u201cNever,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>Savannah looked from one to the other. \u201cI\u2019m going to regret this eventually, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCould be,\u201d Trace said. He took a step closer, reached out and tucked a flyaway strand of hair back behind her ear. \u201cBut you\u2019ll never see it coming.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze locked with his, and suddenly the tables were turned. The desire to kiss her, to taste her, slammed through him with enough force to rock him on his heels. He hadn\u2019t seen that coming, either.</p><p>\u201cWe are never in a million years going to get this tree into the house,\u201d Trace said, eyeing the giant-size pine that Hannah had picked out. \u201cWhat about that one over there?\u201d He pointed to a nice, round, five-foot-tall tree. It was cute. It was manageable. Hannah was already shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d daughter and mother replied in an emphatic chorus.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it\u2019s also a tradition that the tree has to be too big to fit inside,\u201d he grumbled as he began to saw through the trunk. He\u2019d worked for a lawn service one summer and had some skill at sawing down trees and branches, but nothing this size. He should have brought along a chainsaw.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Savannah said, grinning and apparently thoroughly enjoying his struggle with the tree.</p><p>\u201cI think my mother had the right idea after all,\u201d he said. \u201cA ceramic tree that lit up when she plugged it in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yuck,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cThat\u2019s so sad.\u201d</p> <p>As he breathed in the scent of pine and fresh, crisp air, Trace was forced to agree with her. Despite his grumbling about the endless search for the perfect tree and his protests over the size of their choice, he hadn\u2019t felt this alive in years. Something that might have been the faint stirrings of holiday spirit spread through him. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d felt like this.</p><p>\u201cStand back, you two. When this thing falls, you don\u2019t want to be in the way,\u201d he warned as he heard the crack of the wood and felt the tree begin to wobble. One hard shove and it would hit the ground. Before he could touch it, the tree began to topple.....straight at him. It knocked him on his back in the deep snow. He found himself staring straight toward the sky through a tangle of fragrant branches.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d he heard Hannah whisper.</p><p>Her mother choked back a giggle and peered through the branches. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil happened?\u201d he asked, frowning up at her.</p><p>\u201cI gave the tree a teeny little push to help it along. I guess I pushed the wrong way. You aren\u2019t hurt, are you?\u201d The twinkle in her eyes suggested she wasn\u2019t all that worried.</p><p>Trace bit back his own laughter and scrambled out from beneath the tree. \u201cYou are in such trouble,\u201d he warned even as she began backing away, her nervous scramble hampered by the deep snow.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said, regarding him warily.</p><p>\u201cOh, but I would,\u201d he responded quietly. \u201cNobody pulls off a sneak attack on me twice in one afternoon and gets away with it.\u201d</p><p>She tried to escape, but she was no match for his long legs. He caught up with her in a few steps, scooped her up and dropped her into the cushion of snow.</p><p>Hannah\u2019s laughter mingled with theirs. He whirled on her. \u201cOkay, young lady, you\u2019re next. Don\u2019t you know better than to injure a man\u2019s pride?\u201d</p><p>Hannah was quicker to scamper away, but Trace still caught up with her, grabbed a handful of snow and rubbed her face with it. Just then he felt himself being pelted with snowballs from behind. In seconds all three of them were engaged in a full-fledged snowball fight.</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d Savannah said a few minutes later, collapsing into the snow. \u201cI haven\u2019t laughed that hard in ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, either,\u201d Trace said, his gaze clashing with hers. In fact, he could barely recall ever laughing that hard.</p><p>Or wanting a woman as much as he wanted the virtual stranger lying beside him in the icy snow right this minute. With all the heat crackling between them, he was surprised they hadn\u2019t melted the snow right out from under them.</p><p>He started to reach out to touch her cheek, but recalling Hannah\u2019s presence, he drew back. \u201cDo you know what I\u2019d like to do right now?\u201d he asked, his gaze locked with Savannah\u2019s.</p><p>She swallowed hard at the question and shook her head.</p><p>Trace realized that her thoughts had drifted down the same dangerous path as his own. \u201cNot that,\u201d he protested, deliberately teasing her.</p><p>Her cheeks, already pink from the chill in the air, turned an even brighter shade. Another woman might have called his bluff, but she merely kept her gaze on him, apparently waiting to see just how deep a hole he intended to dig for himself.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019d like to do,\u201d he said, \u201cis go back to the house, build a nice warm fire in the fireplace, and.....\u201d He deliberately let the suspense build. He saw the pulse beating a little more rapidly in her neck. He permitted himself a hint of a smile, then said softly, \u201cTake a nap.\u201d</p><p>She was still blinking in confusion when Hannah plopped down between them and said, \u201cGrown-ups don\u2019t take naps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure we do,\u201d Trace told her. His gaze went back to Savannah. \u201cIn fact, sometimes when adults take naps, we have the very best dreams ever.\u201d</p><p>Savannah shot him a knowing look, then rose gracefully to her feet. \u201cWell, by all means, let\u2019s get home so you can get some sleep,\u201d she said testily.</p><p>She muttered something more, something obviously meant for Trace\u2019s ears, not Hannah\u2019s. He caught her hand and held her back until they were well out of Hannah\u2019s hearing.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d he inquired.</p><p>She leveled a look straight at him. \u201cI said, I hope you have nightmares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo dream with you in it could ever be a nightmare,\u201d he said, locking gazes with her once more. \u201cThen again, you could take a nap with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your dreams,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>He winked at her. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>She stopped in her tracks and scowled up at him. \u201cIs this some sort of game with you?\u201d</p><p>There was a hint of anger behind the question that threw Trace completely. \u201cGame? I\u2019m not sure what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you found me at the inn, did you decide I was Aunt Mae\u2019s gift to you or something? Because I am here to tell you that hell will freeze over before I fall into bed with you just because it\u2019s convenient.\u201d</p><p>With that, she whirled away and stalked off as gracefully as the deep snow permitted, leaving him to deal with the tree. He considered running after her, trying to explain, but maybe it was better to give her time to cool down.</p><p>So he struggled with the monster tree, finally getting a firm grip on the trunk, then dragging it through the snow. The trek took forever. By the time he reached the car, Savannah and Hannah were nowhere to be seen. Since the inn was less than a mile down the road, they\u2019d probably decided to walk.</p><p>Trace wrestled with the tree and finally got it half in and half out of the SUV, cursing at the mess it was making of the car\u2019s interior. He tied it securely, then climbed into the vehicle and turned the heater up full blast.</p><p>He was still stinging from Savannah\u2019s tongue-lashing as he drove back to the inn. Granted, he\u2019d only been teasing her, but she didn\u2019t know him well enough to understand that. He\u2019d deserved every bit of scorn she\u2019d heaped on him.</p><p>As he pulled up in front of the house, he noted that the lights were blazing and that smoke was curling from the chimney. Dusk was falling rapidly, and along with it, the temperature was dropping.</p><p>He lugged the tree onto the porch, then left it there to be dealt with after he warmed up with a cup of coffee or maybe some of that hot chocolate Savannah and her daughter were so fond of.</p><p>Inside, he stomped the snow off his boots and tossed his jacket over a chair, then headed for the kitchen where he could hear the low murmur of voices. He found Savannah at the stove stirring a pot of spaghetti sauce. The weathered older man to whom she was talking caught sight of Trace and gave him a wink.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Trace. Savannah here\u2019s been giving me an earful about you,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2019Course, it\u2019s not exactly the same high praise I was used to hearing from Mae.\u201d</p><p>Trace saw Savannah\u2019s back stiffen, but she didn\u2019t turn around. Obviously, the walk had done nothing to cool her temper. She was still royally ticked at him. The apology he owed her would have to wait, though. The man regarding him with such amusement had to be Mae\u2019s longtime lover.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Nate Daniels,\u201d Trace guessed at once. \u201cI heard a lot about you over the years, as well, all of it good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because Mae never had a sharp word to say about anyone,\u201d Nate said. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s because she brought out the best in people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she did in me,\u201d Trace said solemnly, his gaze on Savannah.</p><p>Nate looked from him to Savannah, then stood up and began pulling on his jacket. \u201cThink I\u2019ll be going along now.\u201d</p><p>Savannah whirled around at that. \u201cI thought you might like to stay for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight,\u201d Nate said, shooting a commiserating look toward Trace. \u201cI\u2019ll be around next time you\u2019re interested in having company. Meantime, you two need anything, you give me a call. I\u2019ll be happy to do what I can. You both meant a lot to Mae. I know she\u2019d be happy that you\u2019re here together for the holidays.\u201d</p><p>Savannah regarded him with a disappointed expression. \u201cCome by anytime,\u201d she said, her voice husky, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. \u201cI want to hear everything you can tell me about my aunt.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nate clasped her hand in his. \u201cCome on now, girl. Don\u2019t you be crying for your aunt. She\u2019s at peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I just wish I\u2019d been here for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe understood why you couldn\u2019t be here,\u201d Nate assured her. \u201cAnd I was here. She wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for that,\u201d Savannah said.</p> <p>\u201cNo need to thank me. My place was by her side,\u201d he said simply. \u201cI only wish I\u2019d been able to give her more. Now let me get out from underfoot, so you folks can have your dinner.\u201d He regarded Trace with a stern expression. \u201cAnd a nice long talk.\u201d</p><p>Trace accepted the admonishment without comment. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you out,\u201d he offered.</p><p>Nate shook his head. \u201cNo need. I know the way. Seems to me like you have better things to do,\u201d he said, casting a pointed look at Savannah, who\u2019d deliberately turned her back again.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Trace agreed.</p><p>He waited until he heard the front door close before attempting his apology. \u201cSavannah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I offended you earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf?\u201d she asked with a hint of disdain. She faced him, eyes flashing heatedly. \u201cYou all but propositioned me in front of my daughter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made sure that Hannah was out of earshot before I said a word,\u201d he reminded her, but she didn\u2019t seem the least bit pacified. She turned away and began stirring the spaghetti sauce with a vengeance. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m just plain sorry. I never meant to give the impression that I seriously thought you and I ought to be back here tumbling around in bed together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d she asked skeptically. \u201cThen exactly what did you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just teasing. Your cheeks get all flushed and your eyes sparkle when you get indignant. That was the only reaction I was going for. I was out of line.\u201d</p> <p>She turned slowly and studied him. \u201cApology accepted. I probably overreacted, anyway. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve flirted with a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get the hang of it again.\u201d He reached for her hand and tugged lightly until she was standing directly in front of him. \u201cI only think it\u2019s fair to warn you, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarn me? About what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time I might not be teasing.\u201d</p><p>She gulped visibly, then nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it all right if I stay here, or would you rather I go?\u201d</p><p>She seemed startled\u2014perhaps even dismayed\u2014by his offer to leave. \u201cAunt Mae invited you here. I\u2019m certainly not going to kick you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what Mae wanted,\u201d Trace said. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p> <p>She drew in a deep, shuddering breath, then stiffened her shoulders as she looked straight into his eyes. \u201cI want you to stay.\u201d</p><p>The satisfaction that swept through Trace felt a lot like the exhilaration he felt when a difficult business negotiation ended well. \u201cThen that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do,\u201d he told her solemnly.</p><p>She muttered something that he couldn\u2019t quite make out.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>A flush crept up the back of her neck. \u201cI said, like I really had a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I want that tree to get put up tonight,\u201d she said, facing him with a renewed sparkle in her eyes.</p><p>Trace laughed despite himself. \u201cI do love a woman who\u2019s always working an angle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do,\u201d Savannah said. \u201cMakes you feel more at home, doesn\u2019t it? I\u2019ll bet you spend most of your time with female boardroom piranha types.\u201d</p><p>Trace chuckled at the all-too-accurate assessment. \u201cTrue enough,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut something tells me that\u2019s about to change.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>Savannah sent Trace in search of Hannah, while she got dinner on the table. She also needed the time to compose herself. She knew precisely why she had overreacted to Trace\u2019s teasing. It was because she had actually been tempted to take him up on his offer to slip away for a so-called nap. Even if they\u2019d actually done no more than crawl into bed together and snuggle, it would have satisfied the yearning that had been building in her ever since he\u2019d arrived earlier in the day.</p><p>Of course, she doubted a man like Trace would have settled for simply holding her in his arms. He would have wanted much more, and while she was tempted by that, she didn\u2019t want to wind up with her heart broken when he left in a few days. It was better that she\u2019d made her position perfectly clear. If she was lucky, there would be no more temptations.</p><p>Next time I might not be teasing.</p><p>Trace\u2019s words suddenly came back to haunt her. How convenient that she had forgotten the warning.</p><p>At the sound of his laughter as he and Hannah came toward the kitchen, Savannah\u2019s pulse raced a little faster. The same wicked yearning that had gripped her earlier teased her senses now. She sighed. Resisting him was going to be a whole lot harder than she\u2019d ever imagined. She\u2019d just have to keep reminding herself that he was cut from the same cloth as her workaholic ex-husband.</p><p>\u201cMom, can we put the Christmas tree up tonight?\u201d Hannah pleaded as they finished up bowls of ice cream after the best spaghetti Trace had eaten in years.</p><p>\u201cAccording to tradition, we never put it up till Christmas Eve,\u201d Savannah told her, but she sounded regretful, as if this were one tradition she could be persuaded to change.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s time to start your own tradition,\u201d Trace suggested, earning a high-five from Hannah. \u201cBesides, the sooner the tree is in its stand and has some water, the better it will be, right? It\u2019ll last much longer, and it will fill the house with the scent of pine. Why not start enjoying it now?\u201d</p><p>Hannah studied her mother, clearly trying to gauge her mood. \u201cPlease,\u201d she begged finally. \u201cI\u2019ll go up in the attic and bring down all the decorations you said are up there. Trace will put it up and string up the lights. You won\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept keep the carols going on the CD player and the hot chocolate flowing,\u201d Trace corrected. \u201cWhat do you say, Savannah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say that you two are a formidable team,\u201d she said, feigning an air of resignation that was belied by the spark of excitement in her eyes. \u201cGo on. Bring in the tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know where you want it?\u201d Trace asked. \u201cOnce it\u2019s up, I don\u2019t want to be hauling it all over the house.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cIt goes in front of the window in the living room. That\u2019s where it\u2019s always been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re happy with that?\u201d he persisted.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re starting new traditions and all, I just thought you might want to go for broke and pick a new location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the old one is just fine,\u201d she said. \u201cThat way, anyone driving up to the house will be able to see the lights on the tree.\u201d</p><p>Trace resigned himself to moving the sofa that normally sat in front of that window. \u201cWhere should I move the sofa?\u201d</p><p>Savannah regarded him blankly. \u201cThe sofa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one in front of that window.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes suddenly lit with understanding. \u201cSo that\u2019s why you were so eager to have me put the tree somewhere else. You\u2019re going to be stuck moving furniture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not complaining.\u201d He glanced at Hannah. \u201cDid you hear me complain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said at once.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put that sofa just about anywhere you want it except the attic,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>Savannah regarded him with a wry expression. \u201cI think on the wall facing the fireplace will do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it. Tree in front of the window. Sofa in front of the fireplace. And the easy chairs currently on that wall? Where should they go?\u201d</p><p>A chuckle erupted from deep inside her, lighting up her face. \u201cMaybe Hannah and I can rearrange the furniture while you get the tree in its stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Trace protested. \u201cI\u2019m providing the brawn here. Just give me instructions.\u201d</p><p>By the time Savannah finished with the instructions, he was pretty sure that not one single piece of furniture in the living room would be where it had started out. He figured he could live with that, as long as she didn\u2019t change her mind a million times.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d he questioned. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs sure as I can be before I see what it looks like,\u201d she said.</p><p>Trace sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll get started. You might want to hunt for some painkillers and a heating pad in the meantime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>He leveled a look at her. \u201cWho\u2019s joking?\u201d he asked as he headed for the living room to rearrange the furniture.</p><p>By the time everything was in its newly designated place, including the tree, the room did have a cozier, more festive air about it. A fire crackled in the fireplace, and the fresh scent of pine filled the air.</p><p>Hannah had brought down stacks of boxes of decorations from the attic. They were now scattered over every surface, as she took each one from its tissue and examined it with wide-eyed delight.</p><p>\u201cThese must be really, really old, huh?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cThey certainly look as if they\u2019re antiques,\u201d Trace said, noting the loving care with which she handled them. It must be nice to have family heirlooms to be brought out year after year, each with its own story. But now with Mae gone, who would share those stories with Hannah?</p><p>Savannah came in just then carrying a tray of steaming mugs filled with hot chocolate. Her eyes widened as she saw the decorations.</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI remember these. Mae used to tell us kids about them when she\u2019d take them out of the boxes. We were never allowed to touch them because they were so old and fragile, but we each had our favorites.\u201d</p><p>She immediately picked up a blown-glass rocking horse, its paint beginning to wear away. \u201cThis was mine. This and the angel that goes on the top of the tree. Is that still here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver here,\u201d Hannah said excitedly, picking it up gingerly. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Dressed in white satin with red velvet trim, the angel had flaxen hair and golden wings. The delicate porcelain face had been rendered with a serene look totally appropriate for gazing down on the holiday festivities year after year. Even Trace, with his jaded, unsentimental view of the season, could see the beauty of it.</p><p>\u201cWe always drew straws to see who would get to put it on the top after all the other decorations were on the tree,\u201d Savannah said as she held the angel. \u201cMy dad or one of my uncles would lift up whoever won so we could reach the very top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I put it on this year?\u201d Hannah asked. \u201cTrace could lift me high enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe this year your mom ought to do it,\u201d Trace suggested, seeing the nostalgia in Savannah\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Savannah said at once. \u201cIt was always one of the kids. Of course Hannah should do it\u2014that\u2019s the tradition.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019ll be morning before we get to it unless we get started,\u201d Trace said. \u201cThere are a lot of lights here, and there must be hundreds of decorations. You two sit back and relax while I get the lights on. You can tell me when they\u2019re in the right place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, my favorite job,\u201d Savannah teased, settling onto the sofa with Hannah beside her. \u201cSupervisor.\u201d</p><p>Trace had a devil of a time untangling all the lights, making sure they worked and then getting them on the tree. It was the first time such a task had fallen to him, and he was beginning to see why his father had always grumbled about it. Trace would have settled for three or four strands strategically placed, but Savannah was having none of that.</p><p>\u201cAt least four more strands,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI like a lot of lights.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not hearing any carols while I work,\u201d Trace chided. \u201cWhat happened to the music? Isn\u2019t that your job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops. I forgot. What will it be?\u201d She shuffled through a stack of CDs. \u201cBing Crosby? Nat King Cole? Kenny G? The Mormon Tabernacle Choir? Vince Gill? The Vienna Boys Choir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour aunt certainly had eclectic taste,\u201d Trace commented.</p><p>\u201cShe loved Christmas music. She used to buy at least one new album every year. Obviously she kept up that tradition. So, what\u2019s your pleasure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprise me,\u201d Trace said.</p> <p>Despite the suggestion, Savannah didn\u2019t surprise him at all when she chose the old standards of Nat King Cole. As the singer\u2019s voice filled the room, Trace recalled the way his father had scoffed at the sentimentality of the holiday music. Trace had inadvertently carried that same disdain with him into adulthood. Now, though, with Savannah and Hannah singing along with the music, he began to enjoy the songs.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Savannah encouraged. \u201cSing with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks, I\u2019d rather listen to you,\u201d he said as he wrapped the final strand of lights around the tree.</p><p>\u201cBut singing helps to get you into the holiday spirit. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re off-key,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, his voice a little tight. \u201cI don\u2019t know the words.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him with obvious astonishment. \u201cYou never learned the words to all the old standard Christmas carols?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t played much at our house. My father objected. He said it was just more crass commercialism. We were lucky he let us put up a tree. After a few years, he carried on so about that, that my mother settled for the little ceramic tree I told you about earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you must have heard the carols when you were at your friends\u2019 houses,\u201d she persisted. \u201cOr on the radio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t pay much attention,\u201d he said defensively.</p><p>\u201cHow awful,\u201d she said, studying him with sympathy.</p><p>\u201cSavannah, I got along okay without knowing the words to a bunch of songs that get played once a year.\u201d</p><p>She studied him seriously. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, despite the wariness creeping over him.</p><p>\u201cAs a man who doesn\u2019t seem to have many happy memories of the holidays, how did you end up running a toy company?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLong story,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still early. We have time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to bore Hannah with all this. Besides, we\u2019ve got a tree to decorate.\u201d He deliberately turned to Hannah. \u201cSweetie, are you ready to start hanging those decorations?\u201d he asked, shutting down the topic of his career.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Hannah said eagerly. \u201cMom, you\u2019ve got to help.\u201d</p><p>Savannah cast one last curious look at him, before smiling and picking up several decorations.</p><p>By the time they were finally finished and all the boxes were empty, there wasn\u2019t a bare spot on the tree\u2019s branches.</p><p>\u201cReady for the lights?\u201d Trace asked.</p><p>\u201cWait. Let me turn off the overhead lights,\u201d Savannah said. \u201cIt\u2019s better in the dark.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the main lights were off, Trace plugged in the tree\u2019s. The hundreds of lights shimmered, reflecting off the ornaments and filling the room with dazzling color. Even he was a bit in awe as he stared at it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Hannah whispered.</p><p>\u201cThe very best tree ever,\u201d Savannah agreed.</p><p>Suddenly she was slipping her hand into Trace\u2019s. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cJust following directions,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s more than that. I think we all need a touch of magic in our lives this year, and you\u2019ve made sure we have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I did\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cut off his protest. \u201cThank you,\u201d she repeated emphatically, gazing up at him.</p><p>Trace thought he\u2019d never seen anything so lovely in his life as he gazed into her sparkling eyes, which put the lights on the tree to shame. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said softly, resisting the need to kiss her only because Hannah was in the room.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll go to bed,\u201d Hannah announced with rare impeccable timing.</p><p>\u201cNight, baby,\u201d Savannah said, sounding just a little breathless.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Trace. Thanks for helping with the tree.\u201d Hannah stood on tiptoe to give him a peck on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cGood night, angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d she murmured sleepily as she headed for the stairs.</p><p>Trace looked into Savannah\u2019s eyes, aware suddenly that he was caught up in something he couldn\u2019t explain with his usual rational practicality. \u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m here, too.\u201d</p><p>The most amazing sense of contentment stole through Savannah as she settled onto the sofa with Trace beside her. He was careful not to sit too close, but she could still feel the heat radiating from him, and she was drawn to it more than ever.</p><p>It had been an incredible evening. Even listening to Trace and Hannah bickering over where to place the ornaments on the tree had been wonderful. Hannah wouldn\u2019t have risked such a debate with her father. Things were always done Rob\u2019s way. It was a lesson Hannah had learned early, to keep peace in the family.</p><p>It was more than that, though. Maybe it was the cozy fire. Maybe it was the hot chocolate and salvaged chunks of sugar cookies.</p><p>Or maybe it was simply that for the first time in years, there was no real dissension as the holidays got under way. It had always been a battle to get her husband home from the office in time to help with the preparations. And unlike the bantering between Hannah and Trace, there had been a superior edge to her ex\u2019s tone that had always sent Hannah to her room in tears.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d Savannah said, studying Trace intently.</p><p>He kept his guarded gaze directed toward the fire, but he nodded.</p><p>\u201cChristmas is still a couple of days away. Why did you come up here early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You promised my aunt. But she\u2019s been gone for several weeks now. You could have waited till the last second and still fulfilled your promise.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her, then looked back at the fire. \u201cYou\u2019ll think I\u2019m crazy.\u201d</p><p>Savannah laughed. \u201cI doubt that. Even in the brief time I\u2019ve known you, I can tell you definitely have all your wits about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then, here it is. I was planning to wait till Christmas Eve, rush up here, spend the night and rush right back to the city on Christmas Day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you changed your mind. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI woke up this morning with this weird feeling that I needed to be up here today.\u201d He met her gaze. \u201cNormally I would have dismissed it and kept to my original plan......\u201d His voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d Savannah prodded, intrigued by the distinctly uncomfortable expression on his face. For a man who exuded confidence, it was a rare display of vulnerability.</p><p>\u201cYou know that cooler of chocolate mocha almond ice cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. What does that have to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was delivered to my apartment this morning with a note that said I should get it up here before it melted.\u201d</p><p>Savannah stared at him. \u201cSomeone sent you that ice cream as a gift?\u201d</p><p>His gaze held hers. \u201cNot just someone. It was your aunt\u2019s handwriting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d Savannah whispered. \u201cHow could that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called the store and the delivery service. The arrangements had been made weeks ago.\u201d He shrugged ruefully. \u201cI guess Mae was afraid I might not keep my promise without a little nudge from beyond the grave. Needless to say, I packed my bags and hit the road.\u201d</p><p>She studied him closely. \u201cAre you teasing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no sense of humor. Ask the people who work for me. Heck, it\u2019s even in most of the articles about Franklin Toys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s absurd,\u201d Savannah said, dismissing the suggestion out of hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve been joking and laughing with Hannah and me since you got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, his expression serious. \u201cWhat do you make of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good for you,\u201d she said, her voice suddenly a little breathless. Could it really be that she had something to offer this man who had everything money could buy?</p><p>\u201cWhich, I suspect, is exactly what your aunt had in mind when she plotted this meeting.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly it all made sense to Savannah. The inheritance of Holiday Retreat at a time when she desperately needed a change in her life. The unexpected arrival of a handsome stranger on the inn\u2019s doorstep. Yes indeed, Aunt Mae had been scheming, all right. The realization horrified her.</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry,\u201d she told Trace with total sincerity. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t have dragged you up here with an ulterior motive. If you want to get back to the city and your friends for Christmas, I will certainly understand.\u201d</p><p>Her declaration seemed to amuse Trace for some reason. His eyes were glinting humorously when he reached out to caress her cheek. \u201cAre you kicking me out, Savannah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. I just wanted you to understand that you\u2019re free to go if there\u2019s someplace you\u2019d rather be, people you\u2019d rather be spending the holiday with.\u201d</p><p>As an answer he leaned forward and touched his lips to hers in the lightest, tenderest of kisses. There was a whisper of heat, the promise of fire.....and then he was on his feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning,\u201d he said as he headed for the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m staying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it was what Mae wanted?\u201d she asked, determined to clarify the reason.</p><p>\u201cNo, darlin\u2019. Because it\u2019s what I want.\u201d He winked at her. \u201cBesides, I promised to take you into town tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>With that he was gone, leaving Savannah staring after him. She touched a finger to her lips, where she could still feel his mouth against hers. \u201cAnd you always keep your promises,\u201d she whispered to herself. It was such a little thing, but it meant more than Trace could possibly imagine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She lifted her gaze to seek out a picture of Aunt Mae that sat on the mantel. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Just knowing that there was one man left who kept his promises restored her faith that the future would turn out all right.</p><p>Six</p><p>The scent of fresh-brewed coffee drifted upstairs, pulling Trace out of a perfectly fascinating dream. For once it had nothing to do with mergers and acquisitions, but with a woman\u2014Savannah, to be precise.</p> <p>How could a woman with so little guile, so little sophistication, get under his skin the way she had? That kiss the night before\u2014little more than a friendly peck by most standards\u2014had packed more punch than any kiss he\u2019d experienced in years. He\u2019d left the room, not because he believed in hasty, uncomplicated exits, but because he wanted so much more. If he\u2019d gone after what he\u2019d wanted, more than likely he would have scared her to death. Then she would have kicked him out and he would have spent another lonely holiday season back in New York.</p><p>\u201cI hope to hell you knew what you were doing, Mae,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>When the scent of sizzling bacon joined that of the coffee, Trace quickly showered and dressed in a pair of old jeans, a dress shirt and a heavy pullover sweater. That was about as casual as his attire ever got these days. He reminded himself if he was going to paint the front door and trim and sand the floors, he needed to buy something else to wear.</p><p>When he walked into the kitchen, Savannah regarded him with flushed cheeks and wisps of curls teasing her face. \u201cIs that your idea of work clothes?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr do you intend to supervise today, the way I did last night?\u201d</p><p>Trace noted that she, too, was wearing jeans, but her University of Florida sweatshirt had seen better days, as had her sneakers. She still looked fabulous. He still wanted her. A part of him had been hoping that last night\u2019s desire had been an aberration.</p> <p>\u201cDid I say I was working?\u201d he inquired as he poured himself a cup of coffee, breathed in its rich scent, then took his first sip. \u201cGood coffee, by the way.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cGlad you like it, since it\u2019s yours. I figured you wouldn\u2019t approve of the instant I had on hand.\u201d</p><p>Trace shuddered. \u201cGood guess.\u201d He met her gaze. \u201cExactly what sort of work are you planning to do today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to pick up paint for the guest rooms, a tarp for the roof and.....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa! Why a tarp for the roof?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s leaking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not get it fixed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would if I could get the contractor over here,\u201d she explained with exaggerated patience. \u201cHe said he can\u2019t come till after the first of the year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen call another contractor.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I thought of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll handle it,\u201d he said at once.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you\u2019ll \u2018handle it\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get someone over here to repair the roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if you are a business mogul, I doubt you\u2019ll be any more successful than I\u2019ve been,\u201d she said. \u201cBesides, there\u2019s at least a foot of snow up there. They won\u2019t even be able to look at it, much less start the repairs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, you have a point,\u201d he conceded. \u201cThough that would also seem to make the tarp a waste of time, too, unless you\u2019re planning to put it over the snow.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cOkay, then, no tarp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else do you want from the hardware store?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe paint and tools to scrape the wallpaper will do it. I don\u2019t want to spend any more till I know what the rest of the repairs are going to cost. And I have to set some money aside for new brochures and advertising. I need to start getting paying guests back in here as soon as possible. I\u2019ve already missed the start of the ski season.\u201d</p><p>Trace thought he heard a hint of desperation in her voice that she was trying hard to hide. \u201cSavannah, do you have the money to get this place up and running again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have enough,\u201d she said tightly.</p><p>\u201cWhat about a loan? I could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. I won\u2019t take money from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me talk to the bank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I am not going to start off my new life with a pile of debts. Things will get done when I can afford to do them.\u201d</p><p>Trace admired her pride and her independent streak, but as a practical matter he knew it was better for a business to present its best face from the outset so that word of mouth would spread. She might not take money from him, but she wasn\u2019t in a position to turn down a little practical assistance in the form of labor. She could hardly tell him not to pick up his own supplies. He\u2019d just have to be a little sneaky about it. That meant getting in and out of the hardware store without her catching sight of his purchases.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cHoliday Retreat is yours.\u201d</p><p>There was one more thing he could do, too. It would require a few phone calls, routing his attorney away from his new girlfriend for a couple of hours, but he could pull it off by Christmas.</p><p>\u201cIs Hannah coming into town with us?\u201d he asked as he ate the scrambled eggs Savannah put in front of him.</p><p>\u201cOf course. She\u2019s dying to take a look around. We stopped at the grocery store on our way up here, but that\u2019s all she\u2019s seen. I\u2019ll go get her. We can be ready to leave whenever you\u2019re finished with breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a piece of toast,\u201d she said.</p><p>Trace frowned at her. \u201cI have enough eggs here for three people.\u201d He stood up, grabbed a plate from the cupboard, then divided up his eggs, added two slices of bacon and set it on the table. \u201cSit. You need the protein.\u201d</p><p>Savannah opened her mouth to protest, but his scowl achieved what his directive had not. She sat down and picked up her fork.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I have to get used to serving the guests around here without sitting down to eat with each and every one of them,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a guest.\u201d</p><p>She nibbled thoughtfully on a piece of bacon. \u201cWhich means I probably shouldn\u2019t have cooked this for you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cRight. I told you I\u2019d look out for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember that tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>He regarded her slyly. \u201cOf course, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to get in a little practice in the kitchen. You wouldn\u2019t want the first real guests to starve, would you?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any chance of that. I may not have had a lot of practice at cooking for a crowd, but Aunt Mae has a whole box filled with recipes she perfected over the years. I can read directions with the best of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seem to recall some sort of baked French toast Mae used to make,\u201d Trace said, his gaze on Savannah. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose.....\u201d</p><p>To his surprise, Savannah\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cI remember that. She always made it Christmas morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s a tradition?\u201d Trace asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s a tradition. And yes, I\u2019ll make it. And yes, you can have breakfast with Hannah and me on Christmas morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore or after we open presents?\u201d Trace asked, only to see her shoulders stiffen slightly.</p><p>Hannah arrived in the kitchen just in time to hear the question. \u201cWe\u2019re not having presents this year, \u2019cause we\u2019re poor,\u201d she said with absolutely no hint of self-pity.</p><p>\u201cWe are not poor,\u201d Savannah said, obviously embarrassed by her daughter\u2019s comment. \u201cIt\u2019s just that the divorce and the renovations needed on this place have left us temporarily strapped for cash, so we\u2019re keeping Christmas simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Trace said slowly.</p><p>Simple might be good enough for Savannah, maybe even for Hannah, who seemed resigned to it, but not for him. For the first time in years, he had the desire to splurge on the holidays.</p><p>Oh, he always sent truckloads of toys to various homeless shelters in the city, but his personal gift list was small and mostly confined to business associates. He couldn\u2019t recall the last time he\u2019d had anyone in his life to whom he\u2019d wanted to offer even a small token of affection.</p><p>He made a mental note to make a few more calls the second he had some privacy.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you guys grab your coats while I clean up in here?\u201d he suggested. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the car in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Savannah regarded him curiously, almost as if she suspected something was up because he\u2019d let her description of their financial plight pass without comment.</p><p>\u201cGo on. Warm up the car,\u201d he encouraged, tossing her the keys. \u201cYou cooked. I\u2019ll clean up. That\u2019s my tradition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t have any traditions,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting a new one.\u201d</p><p>To his relief, she seemed to accept that.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be outside,\u201d she said. \u201cTry not to break any dishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he protested, \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>He loaded the dishwasher, turned it on, then grabbed his cell phone. It took less than ten minutes to set things in motion. That was one of the benefits of being rich. Trace rarely threw his weight or his money around. When he did, people were eager enough to do as he asked. He\u2019d always been satisfied in a distant sort of way when he thought of the delight his toys would bring to kids on Christmas morning, but he\u2019d never actually experienced that sense of awe and wonder that was pictured in his commercials. Maybe this year things would be different.</p><p>Satisfied that Christmas was under control, he grabbed his coat and joined Savannah and Hannah, who\u2019d already retreated to the slowly warming interior of the car. Hannah shivered dramatically when he opened the door.</p><p>\u201cI hate cold weather,\u201d she declared.</p><p>Trace regarded her in the rearview mirror. \u201cYou\u2019re living in the wrong place, then, kiddo. Weren\u2019t you the one who was out here half-buried in snowdrifts yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s colder today,\u201d she insisted. \u201cAnd now I\u2019ve seen snow. Yesterday I hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you want to move back to Florida?\u201d Savannah asked.</p><p>There was no mistaking the note of trepidation in her voice, Trace thought. He glanced over and saw the tight lines around her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Hannah said at once. \u201cEven if it is cold, I want to stay here.\u201d</p><p>Savannah\u2019s relief was almost palpable. \u201cWhy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause since we got here, you\u2019ve started laughing again,\u201d Hannah said quietly. \u201cYou never laughed in Florida.\u201d</p><p>Savannah turned her head away, but not before Trace saw a tear sliding down her cheek. He wanted to reach for her, to hold her.....to make her laugh.</p><p>Instead he glanced toward Hannah. \u201cHow about you and me making a pact?\u201d he said. \u201cThe one who makes your mom laugh the most today wins.\u201d</p><p>Hannah\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cOkay. What\u2019s the prize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Trace began thoughtfully. \u201cIf you win, I make us all hot-fudge sundaes for dessert tonight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood prize,\u201d Hannah said enthusiastically. \u201cWhat if you win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you make me the biggest, mushiest Christmas card ever, something I can hang on my office wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d Hannah said, slapping his hand in a high five.</p><p>He glanced toward Savannah and saw that her lips were twitching. It wasn\u2019t a real laugh, but it was at least the beginning of a smile. He pointed it out to Hannah.</p> <p>\u201cI get the first point,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a real laugh,\u201d Hannah scoffed. She leaned over, slipped her hand down her mother\u2019s back and tickled Savannah until she giggled aloud. \u201cThat\u2019s a real laugh,\u201d Hannah said triumphantly.</p><p>Savannah wriggled away, then scowled at both of them. \u201cWhat do I get if I maintain a totally stoic facade all day long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever happen,\u201d Trace said.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Hannah agreed.</p> <p>\u201cBet I can,\u201d Savannah retorted, her eyes twinkling.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that does make it more interesting,\u201d Trace agreed. \u201cIf you win\u2014and that\u2019s a really big if\u2014you get Hannah\u2019s mushy card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? What will you give me?\u201d</p><p>Trace met her gaze evenly and felt his heart take a leap into overdrive. \u201cSame as last night,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>He noted the flush that crept into her cheeks as she remembered that fleeting kiss they\u2019d shared.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to do better than that,\u201d she challenged.</p> <p>His gazed remained steady. \u201cOh, I promise you, darlin\u2019, it will take your breath away.\u201d</p><p>The blasted heater in the car must have shot the temperature into the nineties, Savannah thought, barely resisting the urge to fan herself as Trace\u2019s words hung in the air.</p><p>Unlike the day before, when his seductive teasing had merely irritated her, today she was immediately all hot and bothered and wishing for more.....maybe because she knew for a fact exactly what Trace\u2019s kiss could do to her. Worse, she wanted another of those kisses so badly, she was going to have to try really, really hard not to laugh for the remainder of the day. Given Hannah\u2019s determination to win that bet she\u2019d made with Trace, Savannah was going to have a real struggle on her hands.</p><p>She could do it, though. She just had to remember her resolve.....and keep a whole lot of distance between herself and those two coconspirators.</p><p>The second they reached the hardware store, Hannah begged to take a walk through town.</p><p>\u201cBack here in thirty minutes,\u201d Savannah instructed, relieved to be rid of one of them. She looked at Trace. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you back here in a half hour, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t need my help?\u201d he asked, regarding her with a knowing grin.</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m sure someone will help me carry whatever I buy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere\u2019s the spare key, then, in case you finish before I get back. You don\u2019t mind if I come in and pick up a few things myself, do you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of things?\u201d she asked suspiciously. Trace didn\u2019t strike her as the type who had a lot of fix-it projects back home. Then again, didn\u2019t most men get a little giddy around wrenches and screwdrivers and power tools? Maybe he just wanted to soak up the atmosphere.</p><p>\u201cThis and that,\u201d he said vaguely. \u201cI\u2019ll know when I see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. It\u2019s a big store. I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t be in my way,\u201d she said.</p><p>They parted at the front door. Savannah headed straight for the paint supplies. She\u2019d already thought about the colors she wanted for each of the guest rooms\u2014rich, deep tones, accented by white trim. In no time at all, she\u2019d picked out the appropriate paint chips and had the colors being mixed while she chose brushes, rollers, an edger for trimming and a paint pan.</p><p>Just as she headed through the store toward wallpaper-removal materials, she thought she spotted Trace coming around the end of the paint aisle, but then he vanished from sight. She didn\u2019t see him again until she was unloading her purchases into the back of his SUV.</p><p>\u201cFind everything you were looking for?\u201d he asked, tucking his own mysterious packages beside hers.</p><p>\u201cYes. What about you?\u201d she asked as he lifted something heavy into the car. \u201cWhat on earth is that? It looks as if it weighs a ton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a tool,\u201d he said, immediately turning his attention to the street. \u201cAny sign of Hannah yet? Maybe we should go meet her. We could grab some lunch while we\u2019re in town. There\u2019s a little restaurant on Main Street that Mae used to like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Burger Shack,\u201d Savannah said at once. \u201cIs it still in business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was last time I was here. I took Mae a burger, fries and a chocolate shake from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can almost taste their shakes,\u201d Savannah said. \u201cThey made \u2019em the old-fashioned way with milk and ice cream. They were so thick, a straw would stand straight up in them.\u201d</p><p>When she looked at Trace, his lips were curving into a grin.</p><p>\u201cSounds like that\u2019s a yes,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she said eagerly. \u201cAnd here comes Hannah.\u201d</p><p>She noticed that her daughter was carrying a shopping bag and that her eyes were sparkling with excitement. \u201cWhat did you buy?\u201d Savannah asked.</p><p>\u201cMom, I can\u2019t tell. It\u2019s almost Christmas, remember?\u201d</p><p>Savannah started to question where Hannah had gotten the money to buy a gift, then stopped herself. Rob had probably slipped her a little money before they\u2019d left Florida. Knowing him, that had been his gift to her, and she was turning right around and spending it on Savannah. On Trace, too, more than likely. Her daughter had the most generous heart of anyone Savannah knew, something she clearly hadn\u2019t inherited from her father.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s all you need to tell us,\u201d Trace said, making room in the back of the car for Hannah\u2019s purchases. \u201cYour mom and I were just talking about lunch. You interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019re talking about that burger place on Main Street. The smell coming out of there is awesome. And I saw lots of kids my age going in. It must be the cool place to go.\u201d</p><p>Trace grinned. \u201cThen it sounds like it\u2019s unanimous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess what?\u201d Hannah asked excitedly. She went on without waiting for a response. \u201cI met this girl at the store. Her name\u2019s Jolie. Isn\u2019t that a great name? And she\u2019s my age. We\u2019ll be in the same class at school. She says the teacher is really great. Her name\u2019s Mrs. Peterson. She\u2019s been here, like, forever, but everyone loves her because she\u2019s so nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Savannah said, since Hannah didn\u2019t seem to expect much of a response. She was already rushing on.</p><p>\u201cAnd guess what else?\u201d she said. \u201cJolie says there\u2019s going to be caroling in town tonight and that everyone will be there, so we should come, too.\u201d She regarded Savannah hopefully. \u201cCan we, please?\u201d</p><p>Savannah instinctively thought of how uncomfortable Trace had been when she\u2019d asked him to sing carols at the house the night before. She glanced at him.</p><p>\u201cI think it sounds like a wonderful idea,\u201d he said with apparent sincerity.</p><p>Hannah grinned at him. \u201cJolie says they give out song sheets, so you\u2019ll know all the words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I definitely say we do it,\u201d Trace said. \u201cSavannah?\u201d</p><p>Being out on a cold, snowy evening two days before Christmas singing carols with her daughter and Trace? Savannah couldn\u2019t imagine anything more romantic. That probably meant she ought to say no, but of course she wouldn\u2019t. Not if it meant disappointing Hannah.</p><p>Sure, as if that were the real reason, she mentally scolded herself. She was going to do it because there was no place on earth she\u2019d rather be tonight.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, noting the smile that spread across Hannah\u2019s face. It was almost as bright as the warmth stealing through her.</p><p>Seven</p><p>Savannah had the radio blasting as she got into a rhythm of applying paint to the walls of the first guest room. The beautiful deep shade of green brought the color of the evergreens in the surrounding forest inside. When the white trim was added, it would be reminiscent of the way the scenery looked right now with snow clinging to the trees\u2019 branches. She envisioned a thick, warm comforter in shades of green and burgundy on the queen-size bed, with aromatic candles to match on the dresser.</p><p>Glancing out the window, she caught a glimpse of Hannah building her first snowman and chattering happily, no doubt to Trace, though Savannah couldn\u2019t figure out exactly where he was. He\u2019d been up to something, though for the life of her she couldn\u2019t figure out what it was. The instant they\u2019d arrived home after lunch, he\u2019d disappeared into Mae\u2019s den. She hadn\u2019t seen him since.</p><p>Despite her declaration that she intended to handle the painting task on her own, a part of her had been counting on his defiance of that. She\u2019d expected him to show up by now, if only to critique her work, maybe try to coax a laugh out of her in his ongoing attempt to win that bet with Hannah. Instead, much as her ex-husband would have done, Trace had retreated to whatever work he considered more important.</p><p>Oh, well, this was her job, not his, she thought with a sigh. And a man she barely knew was hardly in a position to disappoint her.</p><p>Besides, the painting was going very well, she decided, as she stood back and surveyed the room. There was an elegance and warmth to the result. Once the finishing touches were in place\u2014probably after she could hit the January white sales at the Boston department stores\u2014it would be perfect.</p><p>Satisfied, she snapped the lid back on the can of paint and prepared to move on to another room, the one she thought of as the blue room, though at the moment it had faded wallpaper that needed to be stripped. It was already late afternoon, so she probably wouldn\u2019t get much of the stripping completed before they left for the caroling in town, but any progress on the messy task was better than none.</p><p>She was about to peel off her first chunk of paper when something that sounded a lot like a big-time power tool kicked on downstairs, followed by a muttered curse, then giggles and deep, booming laughter. Savannah went to the top of the stairs and looked down just in time to see Hannah and Trace cast a furtive look in her direction.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh, we\u2019re busted,\u201d Trace said.</p><p>\u201cIf she heard you cussing, she\u2019ll probably send us to our rooms,\u201d Hannah said, looking downcast.</p><p>Hands on hips, Savannah scowled at them. \u201cWhat are you two doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing bad, Mom. Honest.\u201d Hannah\u2019s expression was filled with sincerity.</p><p>\u201cTrace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right. It\u2019s just a little surprise,\u201d he said.</p><p>Savannah remained skeptical. \u201c, or a shock?\u201d</p><p>Hannah giggled. \u201cMom\u2019s not real good with surprises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because I\u2019ve had so many bad ones,\u201d Savannah said. \u201cBy the way, I\u2019m not hearing any reassuring explanations. Do I need to come down there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d they both said at once.</p><p>The quick chorus only roused her suspicions further. She started down the steps, only to have Trace take the bottom steps two at a time and meet her when she was less than halfway down. Putting both hands on her shoulders, he gazed into her eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Now there was a sixty-four-thousand-dollar question. \u201cI suppose,\u201d she said, hedging. Only Mae\u2019s faith in him was giving him her current benefit of the doubt.</p><p>\u201cWell, you can,\u201d he said, clearly disappointed by the less than wholehearted response. \u201cYou need to go back to whatever you were doing and let Hannah and me finish up what we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>She returned his gaze without blinking. \u201cI was thinking of quitting for the day, maybe coming downstairs for a snack.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring you a snack,\u201d he said at once. \u201cAnything you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn entire pint of your ice cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want,\u201d he said at once.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s it. Something bad is going on down there, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said, trying to brush past him.</p><p>\u201cMom, please,\u201d Hannah wailed. \u201cYou\u2019ll spoil everything. It\u2019s not bad. I promise.\u201d</p> <p>Savannah told herself that it was her daughter\u2019s plea, not the pleading expression in Trace\u2019s eyes that won her over. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep me up here forever, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust another couple of hours,\u201d he said, looking relieved. \u201cStill want that ice cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that was just a test.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI figured as much.\u201d</p><p>Savannah sighed. \u201cI\u2019m going back to strip wallpaper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you ought to take a break,\u201d he suggested. \u201cMaybe take a long, leisurely bubble bath or something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho has time for that?\u201d Savannah grumbled. \u201cThis place isn\u2019t going to get fixed up by itself.\u201d</p><p>He tucked a finger under her chin. \u201cWhen you start saying things like that, it\u2019s exactly the time when you need a break the most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis from a workaholic like you?\u201d she scoffed.</p><p>\u201cActually that\u2019s something your aunt used to say to me every time I protested that I couldn\u2019t get away from the office to come visit. It got me up here every time,\u201d he said, an unmistakable hint of nostalgia in his voice. \u201cAnd she was always right. I always felt better after a few days with her. I even got so I barely cracked open my briefcase the whole time I was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she talk you into taking a bubble bath, too?\u201d Savannah teased.</p><p>\u201cNope, but you probably could,\u201d he retorted, then added in an undertone, \u201cespecially if you were joining me.\u201d</p><p>Heat and desire shot through Savannah like a bolt of lightning. \u201cAny bubble bath I take, I\u2019ll be taking alone,\u201d she told him, keeping her own voice muted.</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d</p> <p>Before she made the fatal mistake of agreeing with him, she whirled around and went back upstairs. She started toward the room where she\u2019d been about to work, then changed her mind and headed another floor up to her bathroom, where she poured some lavender-scented bubble bath into the tub and turned on the water, knowing that the sound would be enough to keep Trace\u2019s imagination stirred up. He wasn\u2019t the only one under this roof who had a wicked streak, she thought with satisfaction as she sank into the warm water. Hers had just been on hold for a while.</p><p>Unfortunately the memory of his suggestion that he join her and the sensual feel of the water against her skin combined to make the bath far less relaxing than she\u2019d envisioned. In fact, she concluded as she stepped from the tub and wrapped herself in a thick terry-cloth towel, it really was too bad that she wouldn\u2019t find Trace waiting for her in her bed. Thank goodness they were going caroling in a couple of hours. It was definitely going to take a blast of icy air to cool off her wayward thoughts.</p><p>\u201cQuiet,\u201d Trace admonished Hannah when they heard Savannah moving around upstairs. Since they were due to leave for the caroling in less than a half hour, he figured they had five minutes, maybe less, before she started down from the private quarters on the third floor. He squeezed Hannah\u2019s hand. \u201cNot a word till she gets all the way down and sees what we\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d only made a dent in the work that was needed to put Holiday Retreat back into shape for guests, but the outside of the front door and the exterior trim were now a bright red, the brass fixtures glistened and the foyer and living room floors were polished to a mellow sheen. Hannah had even fashioned some greens and ribbon into a decoration that had been hung from the brass knocker. In his opinion, with just a little effort, they had made a vast difference in the appearance of the inn. It looked as it had on his first few visits, before Mae had let some of the maintenance slip.</p><p>Beside him, Hannah was practically bursting with excitement as they waited for her mother.</p><p>\u201cI should open the door,\u201d she whispered. \u201cOtherwise, how will she know about the paint and the decoration?\u201d</p><p>Trace grinned at her. \u201cGood point. Why don\u2019t you sneak out the back door, run around to the front and open it when I give the word that she\u2019s almost down the steps. I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s unlocked.\u201d</p><p>Hannah took off, thundering across the floor in her eagerness.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget your coat,\u201d Trace called after her just as he heard Savannah\u2019s footsteps descending from the third floor to the second.</p><p>Since he didn\u2019t want Savannah to miss Hannah\u2019s grand entrance, he stepped into view as she started down the last flight and blocked her way. She paused halfway down, regarding him warily.</p><p>\u201cI am not going back up,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cNever said you should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you standing in my way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I in your way?\u201d he asked, still not budging.</p><p>Savannah sighed heavily, just as Trace heard Hannah hit the porch running.</p><p>\u201cYou look lovely,\u201d he said in a voice meant to carry outside.</p><p>Her gazed narrowed. \u201cAnnouncing it to the world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s worth announcing.\u201d</p><p>At that instant he heard Hannah turn the doorknob. He stepped aside as the door burst open.</p><p>Clearly startled, Savannah looked straight at her daughter, then caught sight of the freshly painted door. Her eyes lit up.</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d she said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d She looked from Hannah to Trace. \u201cIs that what you two were up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly part of it, Mom,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cCome down the rest of the way and look around some more.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Savannah stepped off the bottom stair, she glanced around, her expression puzzled.</p><p>\u201cDown,\u201d Hannah said impatiently.</p><p>Savannah\u2019s gaze shifted to the floor with its brand-new shine. \u201cWhat on earth?\u201d There were tears in her eyes when she turned to Trace. \u201cYou did this? That\u2019s what I heard down here? I couldn\u2019t imagine the wood ever looking like this again. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Hannah beamed at her. \u201cI helped, Mom. Trace and I did it together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a start,\u201d Trace said. \u201cWe only had time to do the foyer and the living room. We\u2019ll do the dining room tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>The tears in Savannah\u2019s eyes spilled down her cheeks. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could start by not crying,\u201d Trace said mildly, stepping closer to brush the dampness from her cheeks. \u201cWe wanted to do something to help. Hannah made the decoration for the door. She\u2019s got a real knack for that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>Savannah\u2019s gaze shifted to the greens. \u201cTrace is right, sweetie. It\u2019s absolutely beautiful. Aunt Mae would be so pleased with all of this.\u201d</p><p>She turned to Trace. \u201cI know you did it for her, but thank you.\u201d</p><p>It had started as something he wanted to do for Mae, but that wasn\u2019t how it had ended up. Trace realized he had done it to put that sparkle into Savannah\u2019s eyes, the sparkle that shimmered even through her tears.</p><p>\u201cIt was the least I could do,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, do you want to admire our work some more, or shall we head into town for the caroling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Hannah said at once. \u201cMom can look at this forever when we come home.\u201d</p><p>Savannah laughed. \u201cSo much for savoring the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made you laugh,\u201d Hannah gloated. \u201cThat\u2019s a whole bunch of points for me and hardly any for Trace. Those sundaes are mine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well,\u201d Trace said with an exaggerated air of resignation. \u201cI suppose the art already on my office wall will have to do.\u201d</p><p>Savannah was quiet on the ride into town. Too quiet, in Trace\u2019s opinion. When they\u2019d finally found a parking place a few blocks from the town square and Savannah was exiting the car, he pulled her aside. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said brightly, though her smile was as phony as that too-chipper tone.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he persisted.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI was just thinking about all the Christmases I missed with Aunt Mae, years when I could have had this, instead of.....well, instead of what we had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go back and change things,\u201d Trace reminded her. \u201cYou can only learn from your mistakes and look ahead.\u201d</p><p>She regarded him intently. \u201cAre there things about your life that you\u2019d change, mistakes you regret?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated over the answer. \u201cI wish things had been easier for my mother,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cBut I was a boy. I had no control over that. She made her own choice to stay married to a dreamer who was very good at criticizing everything she did, but did nothing himself.\u201d</p><p>A half smile touched Savannah\u2019s lips. \u201cYou say that, but you sound as if you still believe that you should have fixed it somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I do believe that,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut by the time I had the money to make a difference in her life, it was too late. She\u2019d already died of pneumonia. She\u2019d let a flu go untreated too long because my father thought she was making too much out of a little cold. Once she got to the hospital, there was nothing they could do. That was the beginning of the end for my dad. He was devastated. I finally saw that in his own way, he had felt my mother was everything to him. He died less than six months later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Trace, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Savannah said.</p><p>He forced aside the guilt that the memory always brought. \u201cTime to take my own advice. I can\u2019t change the past. I have to let it go. We all do.\u201d He managed a smile. \u201cI think I hear a band warming up. It must be about time for the caroling to begin.\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, Hannah, who\u2019d been hurrying ahead of them, bolted back. \u201cHurry up, you guys. The carols are starting. And I see Jolie. Can I go say hi to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Savannah said. \u201cBut then you come back to join us. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Hannah said, racing away from them.</p><p>Left alone with Savannah, Trace reached for her hand and tucked it through his arm. \u201cThis is nice,\u201d he said, looking into her shining eyes. \u201cThe stars are out. The air is crisp. I can smell the bonfire up ahead. It definitely feels as if Christmas is in the air. And there\u2019s a beautiful woman on my arm.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In the glow of the gas lamps on the street, Trace could see Savannah blush. If a simple compliment rattled her so, it must have been years since she\u2019d heard any. Which made her ex-husband even more of a fool than Trace had imagined.</p><p>\u201cYou know, as much as I loved growing up in Florida,\u201d Savannah said, \u201cthis is the only place it\u2019s ever really felt like Christmas to me. Just look around. All the stores are decorated along Main Street. There\u2019s a tree in the center of the green that\u2019s all lit up, and snow underfoot. It\u2019s like a Currier and Ives Christmas card. What could be more perfect?\u201d</p><p>She looked up into Trace\u2019s eyes, and he felt his heart slam to a stop.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said softly.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only thing I can think of that\u2019s more perfect than all of this.\u201d</p><p>For the second time that evening, she was blinking back tears.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he protested. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make you cry again.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a watery smile. \u201cIt\u2019s just that no one\u2019s ever said anything so sweet to me before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you\u2019ve been spending time with the wrong people,\u201d he said emphatically.</p><p>Suddenly she stood on tiptoe, and before he realized what she intended, she was pressing a kiss to his cheek. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re spending Christmas with us.\u201d</p><p>Trace could have let it go at that. It was a tender gesture, not an invitation, but the night was cold and that kiss promised heat. He captured her chin and gazed into her eyes, then slowly lowered his head until his mouth covered hers.</p><p>She tasted of mint and felt like satin. Then the anticipated heat began to work its way through his system, hinting of a simmering passion just waiting to be unleashed. He unzipped her jacket and slid his arms inside, pulling her close until their body heat mingled. She melted against him. They were a perfect fit, her curves soft and yielding, his body hard and demanding.</p><p>Trace could have been content to stay right here, doing nothing more than learning the shape and texture and taste of Savannah\u2019s mouth for hours on end, but sanity finally prevailed. This was a small town. Savannah was a newcomer. The last thing she needed was him stirring up gossip. Whatever happened between them\u2014and there was little doubt that something would\u2014he didn\u2019t want there to be regrets. Not of any kind.</p><p>With a sigh, he slowly released her. His gaze clung to hers as he slid the zipper of her jacket up, then tucked her scarf more securely around her neck.</p> <p>\u201cTrace, what.....?\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew beginnings,\u201d he suggested. He drew in a deep breath of the cold air, then added, \u201cAnd speaking of that, I had an idea I thought I\u2019d run by you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s anything like that last one, the answer\u2019s yes,\u201d she replied, amusement threading through her voice.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t agree until you\u2019ve heard it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat about holding an open house at the inn tomorrow before midnight church services? The downstairs rooms can be ready by then, and it would get people talking about the place.\u201d</p><p>She was staring at him, her expression dazed. \u201cAre you crazy? I can\u2019t be ready for an open house tomorrow night! Even if we could finish up with the downstairs rooms, what about food? We\u2019d need wine and eggnog. All of the good dishes would have to be washed, the table decorated. I can think of a million reasons why it would never work.\u201d</p><p>He waited through the tirade, then asked, \u201cIs that it? Any other objections?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think those are quite enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, your turn to listen to me. I can have a caterer here first thing in the morning. He\u2019s already on standby. He\u2019ll bring all the food, the drinks, the table decorations, linens, crystal and china. All you need to do is say yes and stay out of his way.\u201d He pulled his cell phone out of his pocket. \u201cWhat\u2019s it going to be?\u201d</p> <p>She regarded him with obvious astonishment. \u201cYou\u2019ve already done all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI put it into motion, checked to make sure the caterer I use for our big marketing events was available. I haven\u2019t given the go-ahead. That\u2019s up to you. I thought it might be the perfect way for you and Hannah to get to know your neighbors, a way to let them know that the inn is back in business.\u201d</p><p>She looked torn. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful idea, but I can\u2019t let you do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause.....\u201d Her voice faltered. She frowned at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know why exactly. It\u2019s just too much. Besides, how would we let people know?\u201d</p><p>He sensed that she was weakening and pressed his advantage. \u201cI think we can count on Hannah and her friend to take care of that. Say the word, and we can send the two of them through this crowd. It\u2019ll be faster than an instant-message e-mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if no one comes?\u201d she asked worriedly. \u201cIt is Christmas Eve, after all. People have plans. Then you would\u2019ve gone to all that expense for nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about that. I\u2019m sure people are curious. Some are probably anxious to know if you intend to reopen the inn. It\u2019s been a historic landmark in the town for years. I think they\u2019ll be more than eager to take a little side trip on their way to church.\u201d He waited while the wheels turned in her head. He could practically see the pros and cons warring in her brain, as her expression shifted from dismay to hope and back again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely certain we can pull this off?\u201d she said at last. \u201cIt won\u2019t be the biggest mistake either of us has ever made?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarlin\u2019, when it comes to business, I try really hard never to make mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then,\u201d she said decisively. \u201cMake that call. Then let\u2019s find Hannah and Jolie and put them to work.\u201d</p><p>Trace confirmed the plans with the caterer, who was eager to do anything for the bonus Trace had promised him. After that, finding the girls wasn\u2019t all that difficult. They were right in front, singing at the top of their lungs. Trace pulled Hannah aside and told her the plan.</p><p>\u201cThat is so awesome!\u201d she said. \u201cJolie will help.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her friend over, introduced her to Trace and Savannah, then told her the plan.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Jolie said at once. \u201cI\u2019ll tell my mom and dad to spread the word, too. They know everybody. And this will be way better than sitting around at home while my relatives say the same old things they say every year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them I\u2019ll appreciate whatever they can do to let people know,\u201d Savannah told her.</p><p>The two girls were about to race off when Jolie turned back. \u201cI was supposed to ask you if it would be okay for Hannah to spend the night at my house tonight. A couple of my other friends are coming over, and my mom said it would be okay. She\u2019s right over there, if you want to meet her.\u201d</p><p>Trace saw the indecision on Savannah\u2019s face, but he also saw the anticipation on Hannah\u2019s. \u201cLet\u2019s go over and say hello,\u201d he suggested. \u201cYou can discuss it with Jolie\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes later, Savannah had given her approval for Hannah to spend the night at Jolie\u2019s. Donna Jones had been reassuring about the slumber party and enthusiastic about the open house at Holiday Retreat.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I know all my friends are dying to meet you. Mae Holiday was loved and respected, and everyone wants to let you know that. You\u2019ll have a huge crowd. An open house on Christmas Eve is a lovely thing to do for the community.\u201d</p><p>Savannah looked relieved by her genuine excitement. \u201cI\u2019ll see you then. What time should I pick Hannah up tomorrow morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that,\u201d Donna said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have enough to do. I\u2019ll bring her by around noon, unless you\u2019d like her there earlier to help out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoon will be perfect,\u201d Savannah said, just as the band began to play \u201cSilent Night.\u201d She slipped her hand into Trace\u2019s and began to sing.</p><p>A sensation that felt a whole lot like contentment stole through Trace. Not that he was familiar with the concept. For all of his success, for all of the people who filled his life day in and day out, he\u2019d never experienced a moment quite like this. Maybe there was something magical about the holidays after all.</p><p>Or maybe Mae had been even wiser than he\u2019d realized. Maybe she\u2019d known exactly how to grant wishes before they\u2019d even been made.</p><p>Eight</p><p>The bright red front door closed softly behind Savannah, and she suddenly realized that she was all alone in the house with Trace. Her heart thundered in her chest as she met his gaze and saw the familiar heat slowly begin to stir.</p><p>As he had earlier, he reached for the toggle on her jacket zipper and slowly slid it down, his intense gaze never once straying from her face. His knuckles skimmed along the front of her sweater, barely touching it, yet provocative enough to have her breasts swelling, the peaks instantly sensitive.</p><p>\u201cTell me to stop now, if that\u2019s what you want,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI.....\u201d Her voice quavered. She swallowed hard and kept her gaze level. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d he murmured, his mouth covering hers.</p><p>Savannah hadn\u2019t expected the whirlwind of sensations that tore through her at his touch. Trace had kissed her before, each time more amazing than the last, but this was different somehow. Probably because of where it was destined to lead.</p><p>It had been so long since any man had wanted her, since she\u2019d been open to feeling this reckless surge of desire. From the moment of her divorce, she had resolved never to let another man take away even one tiny bit of her control over her life or her body. In little more than a couple of days, Trace had made that resolve crumble. She\u2019d wanted him almost from the moment he\u2019d stepped into the kitchen on that first day.</p><p>The reaction then had been purely physical. Now it was so much more. She knew the kind of man he was, had seen for herself that the workaholic traits she despised covered a vulnerability spawned years ago. She knew he was kind and generous. Best of all, he\u2019d had Aunt Mae\u2019s apparently unwavering faith. That stamp of approval alone would have been enough to convince Savannah that Trace was someone to be respected and admired.....maybe even loved.</p><p>In one corner of her brain, she wanted to apply reason to all of the feelings he stirred in her, wanted to dissect them with logic, but the rest of her mind was clamoring for something else entirely. Majority wins, she thought, barely containing a giddy desire to laugh with sheer exhilaration.</p><p>And then Trace\u2019s tongue was teasing her lips, tasting her, and the last rational thought in her head fled. From that instant on, it was all about sensation, about dark, swirling heat and a racing heartbeat, about the brush of his hand over flesh, about the clean male scent of him and the way his eyes seemed to devour her as he gauged the effect of each lingering, provocative caress.</p><p>She felt a connection with this near-stranger that she hadn\u2019t felt in years with her ex-husband. It was as if Trace could read her mind, as if he knew exactly which part of her was screaming for his touch. Savannah knew he believed that Mae had brought them together with something exactly like this in mind. And maybe that was how it had happened. It hardly mattered, because it felt right. It felt as if she was exactly where she belonged with exactly the right man. Fate or Aunt Mae\u2014it hardly mattered which\u2014had brought them to this moment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was breathing hard and barely able to stand when he finally paused to take a breath. \u201cCome upstairs with me,\u201d she said, then hesitated, suddenly uncertain. \u201cThat is what you want, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarlin\u2019, I\u2019ve never wanted any woman more than I want you right this second,\u201d he said with flattering sincerity. \u201cAre you sure, though? I don\u2019t ever want you to regret this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made mistakes and I have my share of regrets, but this won\u2019t be one of them,\u201d she said with total conviction.</p><p>She held out her hand and Trace took it. Together they walked up the stairs, past the floor of guest rooms and on to the private quarters on the third floor. In recent years Mae had kept a small room for herself on the ground floor, but Savannah had opted for the privacy upstairs for herself and Hannah. She led Trace to her room, which had a panoramic view of the mountains lit by moonlight glistening on the snow.</p> <p>She walked to the window and stood looking out. \u201cEvery time I look at this view, I feel this amazing sense of peace come over me. It\u2019s so incredibly beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She felt Trace come up behind her, his arms circling her waist.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re more beautiful,\u201d he said softly, his breath whispering against her cheek.</p><p>His hands slid up to her breasts, cupping them. As if the exquisite sensation weren\u2019t enough, the reflection in the window of his hands exploring her so intimately doubled the sweet tug deep inside her.</p><p>She was already shivering when his fingers slid beneath her sweater to caress bare skin. Eyes closed, she leaned back against his chest as he made her body come alive. Her breasts were heavy and aching before he undid the zipper on her jeans and repeated the delicious torment between her legs. She shuddered at the deliberate touches, each more intimate than the last, each coming closer to sending her over the edge.</p> <p>She could feel the press of his arousal against her backside, could feel the heat radiating from him in waves. When she risked another look into the glass, she saw the tension in his shoulders, the hooded look in his eyes as he pleasured her. She\u2019d never known a man could give so much without demanding anything in return.</p><p>The complete lack of selfishness inflamed her even beyond the effect of Trace\u2019s touch. Savannah turned in his arms, then slipped from his embrace. Her gaze locked with his, she stripped her sweater over her head, then let her already-unhooked bra fall to the floor. She knew the precise instant when he saw the reflection of her actions in the window, when that image merged with the one before him and deepened his desire.</p><p>She shimmied out of her jeans and panties, then reached for the hem of his sweater. She slid her hands over his chest, which felt like a furnace in the chilly room.</p><p>\u201cOne of us has way too many clothes on,\u201d he said in a husky growl as he tried to push her hands aside to relieve her of the task of ridding him of his sweater.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t. I get to do this my way,\u201d she challenged.</p><p>A smile curved his lips. \u201cBy all means,\u201d he said. \u201cJust hurry it up, will you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome things should never be rushed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd some things can\u2019t be stopped,\u201d he said, drawing her to him, bending down to circle each throbbing nipple with his tongue in a way that had her gasping.</p><p>The gesture pretty much destroyed her intent to torment him. Instead, she began to rush the task that only moments before she\u2019d planned to draw out until he felt the same urgency she felt. Within seconds, they were both naked and moving toward the bed, knees weakened by exploring hands, desire ratcheted up to a height Savannah had never before experienced.</p><p>When Trace finally entered her, she was already crying out with the first explosive climax. He stilled while the pulsing sensations slowly died away. Then he began to move deep inside her, stirring her all over again, turning restless need into a demanding urgency that stretched every muscle taut with anticipation, until at last, with one sure, deep stroke, he took them both tumbling into a whirlpool of shuddering sensation.</p><p>Finally, still cradled in his arms, she fell into the first dreamless sleep she\u2019d had in months.</p><p>Trace\u2019s heartbeat was easing, his pulse slowly quieting as he gazed down at Savannah. Such a sweet, innocent face to pack so much heat. If he hadn\u2019t been enthralled before, the last few hours would have been a revelation. She had a wicked, wanton streak that could lure a man into the fires of hell. Who would have thought it?</p><p>The strength and resilience he\u2019d seen in her from the beginning took on new meaning when it came to making love. She\u2019d all but exhausted him, yet he couldn\u2019t seem to stop looking at her\u2014touching her\u2014long enough to fall into desperately needed sleep.</p><p>Her porcelain-fine skin was still flushed, her hair tousled. Her chest rose and fell with each breath she took, drawing attention to breasts so perfect they took his breath away. Amazingly he wanted her again. In fact, he suspected that after tonight there would never come a day when he didn\u2019t want her.</p> <p>Forever? The word he\u2019d always avoided like the plague popped into his head and wouldn\u2019t go away. Forever meant commitment. It meant compromising, joining his life with someone else\u2019s, putting her needs above his own. Was he capable of such a thing? Or was he his father\u2019s son in that regard? His father had certainly never considered for a second what his irresponsible choices meant for the rest of the family. Trace had always made sure that there would be no one in his life to be affected by the choices he made.</p><p>Oh, really? This time when he heard the voice in his head, it was Mae\u2019s. More than once she\u2019d scolded him for such self-deprecating comments. She\u2019d pointed out that he had hundreds of employees who counted on him for their livelihoods, that he\u2019d never once let them down, that he\u2019d never let her down.</p><p>He let his gaze linger on Savannah. Was it possible that he could give her everything she needed? Everything she deserved?</p><p>And what about Hannah? Being a stepparent wasn\u2019t easy. Oh, they got along well enough now, but what if the rules changed? What if he were here all the time? Would she balk at any attempt by him to take the place of her father.....in her life or in her mother\u2019s?</p><p>He chided himself for getting way ahead of himself. Just because he and Savannah were compatible in bed, just because they\u2019d spent a couple of incredible days that felt magical, didn\u2019t mean there was a future for the two of them. She might not even want that. Hell, he might not want it. If ever there was a time for clear, rational thought, for not looking beyond the moment, this was it.</p><p>Just then, Savannah sighed deeply and snuggled more tightly against him. Heat shot through him. Heat and need. The need went beyond sex, he realized. He needed what she represented\u2014steadiness, love, family\u2014things he\u2019d never imagined himself wanting.</p><p>It was his turn to sigh then, his turn to tuck his arms more tightly around her. Maybe morning was soon enough for answers. Maybe tonight was simply meant for feeling fresh, new, enticing emotions.</p><p>He breathed in her scent\u2014flowers with a hint of musk\u2014then pressed a kiss to her shoulder. In minutes, he was asleep.</p><p>Savannah lay perfectly still, her eyes closed against the brilliance of the sun and against whatever she might discover in Trace\u2019s expression. It had been so many years since she\u2019d experienced a \u201cmorning after\u201d that she had no idea what to expect. Awkwardness topped the list of possibilities, though.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re playing possum,\u201d Trace teased, his voice low and husky and warm as it whispered against her cheek.</p><p>\u201cAm not,\u201d she denied, feeling a smile tug the corners of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Sleeping Beauty, wake up. We have a million things to do today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose any of them include staying right here in bed?\u201d she asked wistfully.</p><p>\u201cAfraid not.\u201d</p><p>To her relief, he sounded as disappointed about that as she felt. \u201cAnd once Hannah\u2019s back under this roof, I suppose any more nights like this are out of the question, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour call, but I\u2019d say that\u2019s the sensible way to go.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes then and met his gaze. Fighting against the uncertainty spilling over her, she asked, \u201cThen this was a one-night thing?\u201d</p><p>His gaze never wavered. \u201cNot if I can help it,\u201d he said emphatically. \u201cI think that\u2019s something we need to discuss in detail, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Actions seemed vastly preferable to words in Savannah\u2019s current frame of mind, but he was right. Talking was definitely indicated, someplace and at a time when temptation wasn\u2019t inches away.</p><p>\u201cI suppose there\u2019s enough time for me to do this,\u201d he murmured after a quick glance at the clock on the bedside table. \u201cAnd this.\u201d</p><p>Kiss followed kiss until Savannah was writhing and crying out for him to slide inside her. The sweet urgency, the rush for one more taste, one more touch, made their joining even better than any they\u2019d shared during the night before.</p><p>\u201cNow we really do have to get up,\u201d Trace said with obvious regret. \u201cThe caterer will be here in an hour, and I\u2019ve got to polish the dining room floor and be out from underfoot when he gets here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fix breakfast,\u201d Savannah said. \u201cAnd clean up the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s heated gaze roamed over her. \u201cOr we could take a leisurely shower together, and to heck with breakfast and polishing the floor.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cI think breakfast is highly overrated anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a sentiment you should be sharing with prospective guests,\u201d Trace advised as he scooped her up and carried her to the shower.</p><p>They were still damp and barely dressed when the doorbell rang.</p><p>\u201cNick of time,\u201d he said with a wink. \u201cI\u2019ll get it. You might want to see if you can tone down that blush before you meet Henri. He\u2019s French and considers himself an expert on the nuances of romance. One glimpse of you, and he\u2019ll be offering more unsolicited advice than you ever dreamed of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeaven help me,\u201d Savannah said wholeheartedly. \u201cI\u2019ll be down in a minute.....or an hour. However long it takes.\u201d</p><p>When Trace had gone, she sat down at her dressing table and studied her face in the mirror. He was right. She was flushed in a way that was entirely too revealing. Even so, she couldn\u2019t seem to stop the grin that spread across her face.</p><p>\u201cGet a grip,\u201d she told herself firmly. \u201cTonight\u2019s too important for you to be frittering away time up here.\u201d</p><p>But no matter how important tonight was, she had a very strong hunch it wouldn\u2019t hold a candle to last night, especially if Trace refused to share her bed again.</p><p>By eight-thirty, Savannah knew that the open house was going to be a roaring success. Neighbors were crowded into every room, sharing holiday toasts, commenting on the delicious food as Henri basked in their compliments. Again and again, they had paused to welcome her and Hannah and tell them how delighted they were that Holiday Retreat would be reopened.</p><p>\u201cMy parents honeymooned here,\u201d Donna Jones confided when she caught up with Savannah during a quiet moment in the dining room. \u201cMy mother claims I was conceived here, since I was born almost nine months to the day after their wedding night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Savannah grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll bet I know which room,\u201d she said. \u201cAunt Mae always referred to it as her honeymoon suite because it\u2019s the largest room here. Want to take a peek? The decorating isn\u2019t finished, but I painted it yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019d love to,\u201d Donna said, following her upstairs.</p><p>At the door of the freshly painted green room with its white antique iron bed, she turned to Savannah with a gleam in her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be beautiful.\u201d She moved to the window that faced the mountains. \u201cAnd the view is fabulous. I wonder if I could convince my husband to sneak off here for a weekend sometime.\u201d</p><p>Savannah heard the wistfulness in her voice and considered it thoughtfully. \u201cYou know, it might not be a bad idea to offer an introductory weekend getaway special for locals. People get so used to living in a place like this, they forget that the tourists who come here see it entirely differently.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd it seems silly to spend money to stay just a few miles from home,\u201d Donna said enthusiastically. \u201cBut if it were a special promotion, I\u2019ll bet you\u2019d be jammed with reservations. There\u2019s no better way to build word of mouth. People would start sending all their out-of-town guests here. It could fill in the slack once ski season dies down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do it,\u201d Savannah said, delighted by the whole idea. \u201cAnd for giving me the idea, your stay will be free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Donna protested. \u201cThat\u2019s no way to start a business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it is. You\u2019ll tell everyone you know how fabulous it is, so when I offer the promotion, it will be sold out in minutes.\u201d</p><p>As they walked back downstairs, Donna regarded Savannah with open curiosity. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the story with you and Trace Franklin? I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m being nosy, but everybody in town remembers his coming to visit Mae. A handsome, single man who owns his own company is bound to stir up comment. Have you known him long?\u201d</p> <p>Savannah felt a now-familiar flush creep into her cheeks. \u201cOnly a few days,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cMy, my,\u201d Donna teased, \u201cyou work fast! I know a lot of women who tried to get to know him on his prior visits, and he never gave any of them a second glance. Last night he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off you, and, if anything, he\u2019s watching you even more intently tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say you\u2019re just friends, I\u2019ll lose all respect for you,\u201d Donna teased. \u201cAny woman who doesn\u2019t grab a man like that ought to have her head examined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking about me, by any chance?\u201d Trace inquired, stepping up beside Savannah and slipping an arm around her waist.</p><p>Savannah felt her face heat another ten degrees. \u201cWe were talking about\u2014\u201d she frantically searched her brain for a suitably attractive, sexy bachelor \u201cKevin Costner.\u201d</p> <p>Trace regarded her with amusement. \u201cOh? Is he in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but we do like to dream,\u201d she said, as Donna coughed to cover her laughter.</p><p>Trace leaned down to whisper in her ear. \u201cLiar,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll go chat with my husband and tell him about your offer,\u201d Donna said. She grinned at Trace. \u201cNice to see you again. Merry Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>When Donna had gone in search of her husband, Savannah lifted her gaze to meet Trace\u2019s. \u201cI think the party\u2019s a success. Thank you for talking me into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been fun,\u201d he said, as if that surprised him just a little. \u201cMae\u2019s introduced me around before, but this is the first chance I\u2019ve had to really talk to some of the locals. They\u2019re good people, and they really are delighted that you\u2019re reopening the inn. Not only has this place been a boon to the economy, its history and charm provide something that the chain hotels can\u2019t. I didn\u2019t realize that in its heyday, Holiday Retreat employed several full-time people on staff and that the dining room was open to the public for dinner. Is that part of your plan, as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually,\u201d Savannah said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to take things slowly, so that I don\u2019t get overextended financially. Once all the rooms are ready for paying guests, then I can start thinking about whether to offer more than breakfast. I can cope with making eggs or French toast\u2014I\u2019m not so sure I could handle gourmet dinners. And I know I can\u2019t afford any help yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour spaghetti was pretty good,\u201d he said.</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cSomehow I doubt that\u2019s up to the standard the guests would expect. Remind me and I\u2019ll show you some of the old menus. Mae stopped doing the dinners about ten years ago, when it got to be too much for her, but she saved all the records. Since she left the file right where she knew I\u2019d find it first thing, I\u2019m sure she was hoping that I\u2019d open the dining room again in the evenings.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the party passed in a blur. Soon guests were putting on coats, thanking Savannah for having them over and leaving for the Christmas Eve services planned by the local churches. When the last guest had departed, Hannah found Savannah and Trace standing on the front porch.</p><p>\u201cMom, this was the best. I must have met everybody in my class at school. I can\u2019t wait to start after New Year\u2019s. And there\u2019s going to be an ice-skating party in a couple of days and I\u2019m invited. Isn\u2019t that totally awesome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally,\u201d Savannah agreed.</p><p>Trace grinned. \u201cThen you\u2019re back to being happy about living in Vermont?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cCan we go to church now?\u201d</p><p>Trace glanced at Savannah. \u201cWhat about it? Are you too tired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired, but exhilarated. Besides, going to Christmas Eve services was always part of the tradition. I\u2019ll grab my coat.\u201d</p><p>Trace drove into town, which was teeming with many of the same families who had just left Holiday Retreat. They were all walking toward the various churches within blocks of the town square. Bells were ringing in the clear, crisp air.</p><p>As they entered the same little white chapel Savannah had attended with her family so many years ago, the scent of burning candles, the banks of red poinsettias by the altar, the swell of organ music, all combined to carry her back to another time. A wave of nostalgia washed over her.</p><p>How had she let moments like this slip away? As a child, she\u2019d had no choice, but she could have insisted on coming back as an adult, even if she\u2019d had to leave Rob behind to sulk in Florida. His mood had always been sullen around the holidays anyway. What would it have mattered if it got a little worse because she was sharing an experience like this with their daughter?</p><p>Ah, well, those days were behind her. She glanced at Hannah and saw the wonder in her eyes as the choir began to sing \u201cO, Holy Night.\u201d Trace slipped his hand around hers as the familiar notes soared through the tiny, crowded church.</p><p>Savannah\u2019s eyes filled with tears at the beauty of the moment. Trace regarded her with such a concerned expression that she forced a watery smile. \u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, angel.\u201d</p><p>Hannah heard the murmured exchange and beamed at both of them. \u201cMerry Christmas, Mom. Merry Christmas, Trace. I don\u2019t care if we don\u2019t have presents. This is the best holiday ever.\u201d</p><p>Gazing into Trace\u2019s eyes, Savannah couldn\u2019t help but agree with her daughter. It was definitely the best one ever.</p><p>Nine</p><p>Savannah was hearing bells. Convinced it was a dream, she rolled over and burrowed farther under the covers.</p><p>\u201cMom! Mom! You\u2019ve got to see this! Hurry!\u201d Hannah shouted, shaking Savannah.</p><p>Groaning, Savannah cracked one eye to stare at her daughter. \u201cThis had better be good.\u201d She and Trace had sat up talking until well past midnight, and if she wasn\u2019t mistaken, the clock on her bedside table said it was barely seven. Even if it was Christmas morning, she had counted on at least another hour\u2019s sleep, especially since Hannah wasn\u2019t expecting Santa\u2019s arrival.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just good,\u201d Hannah said, clearly undaunted by her testy tone, \u201cit\u2019s fantastic. Come on, Mom. Hurry. I\u2019m going to wake up Trace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Savannah shouted, but it was too late. Hannah was already racing down the stairs screaming for Trace. Savannah heard his groggy reply, which amazingly was far less irritated than her own had been. In fact, he sounded downright cheerful.</p><p>Even with all that commotion right downstairs, Savannah could still hear those bells, louder and more distinct now. She tugged on her robe and went to the window, then stood there, mouth gaping at the sight that greeted her.</p><p>There was a huge, horse-drawn sleigh coming through the snow toward the house, the bells on its reins jingling merrily. The back was piled high with sacks and wrapped packages. And the driver was.....She blinked in disbelief and looked again. Nope, no mistake. The driver was Santa himself.</p><p>Savannah whirled around and headed for the stairs, pausing only long enough to run a brush through her hair and take a swipe at scrubbing her face and teeth. She met Trace at the second-floor landing. Hannah was already downstairs with the front door thrown open to allow in a blast of icy air.</p><p>Savannah studied Trace\u2019s expression, looking for evidence of guilt. \u201cWhat do you know about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? I have no idea what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSanta? The sleigh piled with gifts? It has your name written all over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll find that\u2019s true,\u201d he said, giving her a quick kiss. \u201cStop fussing and go down there. Santa\u2019s a busy fellow. I doubt he has all day to hang around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrace!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he said, waiting until she led the way before following along behind.</p><p>They arrived downstairs just as Santa trudged up the steps toting two huge sacks. Still filled with suspicion, Savannah stopped him in his tracks. \u201cAre you sure you have the right place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoliday Retreat?\u201d he said, edging past her. \u201cYou\u2019re Savannah Holiday, right? And that young lady out there by the sleigh is Hannah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen this is definitely the place. Even after such a long and busy night, I try not to make mistakes. Sorry about not squeezing down the chimney the traditional way, but if I go home with this suit all covered with cinders, Mrs. Claus will have my hide.\u201d</p><p>Savannah barely managed to suppress a chuckle. \u201cI had no idea Mrs. Claus was so tough on you.\u201d</p><p>The jolly old man with a weathered face and white beard, who looked suspiciously like Nate Daniels, rolled his eyes. \u201cYou have no idea. Now, where would you like these gifts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder the tree, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that would be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInside, in the living room on the right.\u201d</p><p>Santa carried two loads of packages inside, declined Savannah\u2019s offer of hot chocolate, then left with a cheery wave and a hearty \u201cho-ho-ho\u201d that echoed across the still air. Hannah stared after him, still wide-eyed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMom, do you think that was really Santa?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Savannah exchanged a look with Trace, trying to gauge from his reaction whether her guess about Nate Daniels was correct. Before she could respond, Trace spoke up.</p><p>\u201cLooked exactly like Santa to me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you said you weren\u2019t going to have presents this Christmas, so who else but Santa would bring them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have some theories about that,\u201d Savannah muttered under her breath, but she kept her opinion to herself. She might have a few words for Trace later in private, but she was not going to strip that excitement from her daughter\u2019s eyes. \u201cHow about breakfast before we open gifts?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Hannah protested. \u201cI want to see what\u2019s in the boxes, especially that great big one. Santa could hardly get it up the steps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that Christmas is about more than presents,\u201d Savannah felt duty-bound to remind her.</p><p>\u201cI know, Mom, but these are here and some of them are for me. I checked the tags.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly some? Who are the others for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, silly. And Trace.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe?\u201d Trace said, looking more shocked than he had at any time since this incredible morning had begun.</p><p>Savannah studied him intently. His surprise seemed genuine. Was it possible he wasn\u2019t behind this? Or at least not all of it? Curious to find out for sure, she acquiesced to Hannah\u2019s pleas and followed her into the living room.</p><p>\u201cBig box first,\u201d Hannah said, rushing over to it. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour call,\u201d Savannah agreed.</p><p>The big box turned out to contain skis and ski boots. Hannah immediately had to try them on. \u201cThese are so totally awesome,\u201d she said, then wailed, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know how to ski.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Santa thought of that,\u201d Trace suggested, his expression innocent.</p> <p>Hannah\u2019s expression brightened at once. She began ripping open her remaining presents in a frenzy, oohing and aahing over each toy, over a new ski jacket and finally over the certificate for ski lessons that came in a deceptively large box.</p><p>Though a part of Savannah wanted to protest the degree of excess, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to spoil the moment.</p><p>\u201cYour turn now, Mom,\u201d Hannah said, bringing her a comparatively small box that seemed to weigh a ton.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth?\u201d Savannah said when she tried to lift it. She began carefully removing the wrapping paper until Hannah impatiently ripped the rest away, then tugged at the tape on the box. Inside, nestled in packing chips and tissue paper, was a tool kit, painted a ladylike pink but filled with every conceivable practical tool she could ever possibly need.</p><p>Her gaze shot to Trace. How had he guessed that she would prefer a gift like this to something totally impractical?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d she said, her gaze locked with his.</p><p>\u201cSanta must know you pretty well,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cMom, there\u2019s a huge box here for you, too,\u201d Hannah said, shoving it across the floor.</p> <p>This time she discovered a floor polisher, precisely the kind she would need if she was to keep the inn\u2019s floors gleaming. For most women, an appliance on Christmas morning would have been cause for weeping, but Savannah\u2019s heart swelled with gratitude.</p><p>\u201cWait, Mom. There\u2019s something little tucked inside with a note,\u201d Hannah said, her expression puzzled as she handed it to Savannah.</p><p>At the sight of the jewelry-size package, Savannah\u2019s breath caught in her throat. Her gaze shot to Trace, but he looked as puzzled as Hannah had. Then she caught sight of the handwriting on the envelope. It was Aunt Mae\u2019s.</p><p>Tears stung Savannah\u2019s eyes as she opened the note.My darling girl,I hope you are happily settled in by now and that you will love your new home as much as I have over the years. I\u2019ve done what I could to be sure you find joy here.Here\u2019s something else I hope will bring you happiness. It belonged to your great-great-grandmother.With all my love to you and Hannah. I wish I could be there with you this morning, but please know that wherever I am, I will always be looking out for you.Mae</p><p>Savannah sighed and blinked back tears. Finding Mae\u2019s present tucked amid all the others made her question everything. She\u2019d been so sure that Trace had sent them, but now? Recalling Santa\u2019s resemblance to Nate made her wonder if Mae hadn\u2019t been behind this whole magical morning.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to open it?\u201d Hannah asked, leaning against her and regarding the box with evident fascination.</p><p>Savannah slipped off the wrapping paper, then lifted the lid of the velvet box. Inside, on a delicate gold chain, was an antique gold cross. The workmanship was exquisite. The gold seemed to glow with a soft light of its own. She could remember Mae wearing this cross every day of her life. She had always said it symbolized faith itself\u2014so fragile yet enduring.</p><p>She opened the delicate clasp, slipped on the necklace, then fastened it. The gold felt warm against her skin, as if it still held some of Aunt Mae\u2019s body heat. Once more, her eyes turned misty. She felt Trace take her hand and give it a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Hannah said. \u201cThere\u2019s another box. It\u2019s for you, Trace.\u201d</p><p>Once more, he looked completely disconcerted. Hannah gave him the present. He handled it gingerly, studying the large, flat box with suspicion.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it say on the tag?\u201d Savannah asked, curious herself.</p><p>\u201cJust Trace,\u201d he said. \u201cNo other name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be from Santa, then,\u201d she teased.</p><p>He slipped open the paper, then pulled out the box and lifted the lid. The grin that broke over his face was like that of a boy who\u2019d just unexpectedly received his heart\u2019s desire.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Savannah asked, trying to peer over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest, mushiest card I could make,\u201d Hannah said, grinning. \u201cAnd Mrs. Jones took me to get it framed so Trace could hang it on his office wall.\u201d</p><p>Trace stared at her, looking completely mystified. \u201cBut I lost the bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Hannah said delightedly. \u201cBut I could tell you really, really wanted the card, so I made it anyway.\u201d She threw her arms around his neck. \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d</p><p>To Savannah\u2019s shock, there was a distinct sheen of tears in Trace\u2019s eyes as he hugged her daughter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the very best present I ever received,\u201d he told her with such sincerity that Hannah\u2019s whole face lit up.</p><p>If this didn\u2019t stop, Savannah was going to spend Christmas morning bawling like a baby. She was about to head for the kitchen to start on breakfast, when Trace grabbed her hand and halted her.</p><p>\u201cWait. I think there\u2019s one more present for you, Savannah,\u201d he said, pointing Hannah toward a flat box beside the chair where he\u2019d been sitting earlier. \u201cBring that one to your mom.\u201d</p><p>The box weighed next to nothing, but when Savannah tore off the paper and looked inside, her mouth dropped open. \u201cStock certificates?\u201d she asked, turning to Trace. \u201cIn Franklin Toys? I can\u2019t possibly accept such a gift from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not from me,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cNot directly, anyway. These were Mae\u2019s shares of the company. She gave me power of attorney to vote them for her during the last weeks of her illness, but she told me I\u2019d know what to do with the shares after her death.\u201d He looked straight into Savannah\u2019s eyes. \u201cI think she would want you to have them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she left me the inn,\u201d Savannah protested. \u201cAnd Franklin Toys is your company.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll remember that when you vote, but in many ways the company was as much Mae\u2019s as it was mine. She\u2019d want you to have the financial independence those shares can give you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t know anything about running a corporation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can learn,\u201d he said. \u201cOr you can sell the shares back to me, if you\u2019d prefer to have the cash. The choice is yours.\u201d</p><p>Savannah sat back, still filled with a sense of overwhelming shock and gratitude. And yet.....She studied Trace carefully. \u201cIs this really what you want to do? She gave you her power of attorney, not me. I think she wanted you to control these shares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted me to do the right thing with them,\u201d he corrected. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s turning them over to you. They\u2019re yours, Savannah. My attorney took care of the transfer yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Once again, Savannah looked at the certificates. She had no idea what each share was worth in today\u2019s market, but it had to be a considerable amount. The thought that she would never again have to worry about money was staggering.</p><p>This truly was a season of miracles.</p><p>Christmas morning had been incredible. It was everything Trace had imagined, from the awe and wonder on Hannah\u2019s face to the amazement on Savannah\u2019s when she\u2019d realized that her financial future was secure. Trace had given the two of them everything he knew how to give. He\u2019d been deeply touched by their gratitude.</p><p>Somehow, though, it wasn\u2019t enough. He wanted more, but he had no idea how to ask for it, or even if he had the right to, especially after knowing the two of them for such a short time.</p><p>Struggling with too many questions and too few answers, he wandered into the kitchen where Savannah was just putting the turkey into the oven.</p><p>She turned at his approach, studied him for a minute, then gave him a hesitant smile. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Why wouldn\u2019t it be?\u201d he asked, feeling defensive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. You seem as if you\u2019re suddenly a million miles away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot on my mind. In fact, if you don\u2019t need my help right now, I was thinking of taking a walk to try to clear my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said at once. \u201cIt\u2019ll be hours before the turkey\u2019s done, and everything else is set to go in the oven once the turkey comes out.\u201d She continued to regard him worriedly. \u201cWant some company?\u201d</p><p>Trace shook his head. \u201cNot this time. I won\u2019t be gone long,\u201d he said, turning away before the quick flash of hurt in her eyes made him change his mind. How could he possibly think about what to do about Savannah if she was right by his side tempting him?</p><p>He heard her soft sigh as he strode off, but he refused to look back.</p><p>Outside, the snow was a glistening blanket of white. The temperature was warmer than it had been, though still below freezing if the bite of wind on his face was anything to go by. He almost regretted the decision to take a lonely walk when he could have been inside in front of a warm fire with Savannah beside him.</p><p>He headed for the road, then turned toward town. He\u2019d only gone a hundred yards or so when Nate Daniels appeared at the end of his driveway. He was bundled up warmly, an unlit pipe clamped between his teeth. He paused to light the tobacco, then regarded Trace with a steady, thoughtful look.</p><p>\u201cMind some company?\u201d he asked, already falling into step beside him.</p><p>\u201cDid Savannah call you?\u201d Trace asked.</p><p>\u201cNope. Why would she do that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think she was worried when I took off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe called earlier to wish me a merry Christmas, but that was hours ago,\u201d Nate said. He regarded Traced curiously. \u201cFunny thing, she seemed to have the idea that I was over there this morning playing Santa. Where would she get a notion like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSanta did bear a striking resemblance to you,\u201d Trace said.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her, though, did you? You let her go on thinking that Mae was behind all the gifts and that she was the one who conspired with me to bring them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, she suspects I had something to do with it, but there were enough surprises to throw her off.\u201d He glanced at Nate. \u201cSo, if Savannah didn\u2019t call, what brings you out into the bitter cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth is, I was all settled down with a new book my son gave me for Christmas when I felt this sudden urge to go for a stroll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? A sudden urge?\u201d Trace said skeptically.</p><p>Nate nodded. \u201cFinding you out here, I\u2019m guessing Mae put the thought in my mind.\u201d</p><p>Trace kept his opinion about that to himself. Maybe Mae did have her ways even from beyond the grave.</p> <p>\u201cSomething on your mind?\u201d Nate inquired after they\u2019d walked awhile in companionable silence.</p><p>Okay, Trace thought, here was his chance to ask someone older and wiser whether there was such a thing as love at first sight, whether a marriage based on such a thing could possibly last.</p><p>\u201cDo you think there\u2019s such a thing as destiny?\u201d Trace asked.</p><p>Nate\u2019s lips didn\u2019t even twitch at the question. \u201c\u2019Course I do. Only a fool doesn\u2019t believe there\u2019s a reason we\u2019re all put on this earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that applies to love, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine you\u2019re asking about you and Savannah,\u201d Nate said. \u201cNow, granted I\u2019ve only seen the two of you together once or twice, but looked to me as if there was something special between you. It\u2019s not important what I think, though. What do you think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I even believe in love,\u201d Trace said dejectedly.</p><p>\u201cWell now, there\u2019s a topic with which I\u2019m familiar,\u201d Nate said. \u201cYou know about Mae and me, I imagine.\u201d</p><p>Trace nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou probably don\u2019t know so much about me and Janie, my wife. Janie and I met when we were kids barely out of diapers,\u201d he said, a nostalgic expression on his face. \u201cBy first grade I\u2019d already declared that I wanted to marry her, though at that age I didn\u2019t really understand exactly what that meant. Not once in all our years of growing up did I change my mind. Janie was the girl for me. We married as soon as I graduated from college, settled down right here and began raising a family.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Trace. \u201cNow that should have been a storybook ending, two people in love their whole lives, married and blessed with kids. But Janie\u2019s nerves started giving her problems. The kids upset her. Anytime I was away from the house for more than a few hours, she\u2019d get so distraught, I\u2019d find her in tears when I came home. The doctors checked for a chemical imbalance. They tried her on medicine after medicine, but slowly but surely she slipped away from me.\u201d</p><p>Tears glistened in his eyes. \u201cThe day I had to take her to Country Haven was the worst day of my life. I told her she\u2019d be home again, but I think we both knew that day wouldn\u2019t come. She\u2019s happy at Country Haven. She feels safe there. But there\u2019s not a day that goes by that I don\u2019t miss the carefree girl I fell in love with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds as though you still love her deeply,\u201d Trace said.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Nate said simply.</p> <p>\u201cThen what about Mae?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter Janie went into the treatment facility, Mae helped out with the kids from time to time. They adored her. They stopped by the inn every day after school, and she always had cookies and milk waiting for them. Soon enough, I took to stopping by, too. Mae was a godsend for all of us during that first year.\u201d</p><p>He met Trace\u2019s gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s important that you know that nothing improper went on between us. I considered myself a married man and I loved my wife. But I loved Mae, too. Since you\u2019re not even sure if love exists, I don\u2019t know if you can understand that it\u2019s possible for a man to love two women, but I did. If I had thought for a single second that my friendship with Mae would hurt Janie, I would have ended it. But the truth was, there were times when Janie didn\u2019t even seem to know who I was, didn\u2019t seem to care that I was there to visit. That never kept me from going, but it did make me see that I didn\u2019t need to lock my heart away in that place with her. I gave Mae every bit of love I felt free to give her. I also gave her the freedom to choose whether to love me. I admired her too much to do anything less.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cGiven the way of the world now, a lot of men would have divorced a wife like Janie and moved on. That wasn\u2019t my way. I\u2019d made a commitment, and I honored it in the only way I knew how. And whether you believe it or not, I honored my commitment to Mae the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you were in such a difficult position,\u201d Trace said. \u201cIt must have been heartbreaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving Mae in my life was one of the best things that ever happened to me. I can\u2019t possibly regret that it couldn\u2019t have been more, except for her sake. She deserved better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you made her very happy,\u201d Trace told him.</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d Nate said, then paused and looked directly into Trace\u2019s eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason I\u2019m telling you this. I always believed that one day Mae and I would be able to be together openly, that we\u2019d marry and spend our remaining years together. Maybe even do a little traveling. We never had that chance.\u201d</p><p>Trace understood what he was saying. \u201cThis is your way of reminding me that life is short and unpredictable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. If you love Savannah, don\u2019t waste time counting the days until it seems appropriate to tell her. Don\u2019t fritter away precious hours planning for the future. Start living every moment. I\u2019ve lived a good long life, but I\u2019m here to tell you that it\u2019s still a whole lot shorter than I\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d circled around and were back at Nate\u2019s driveway. \u201cThink about what I said,\u201d he told Trace.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Trace promised. \u201cWould you like to join us for Christmas dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would, but I\u2019ll be going out to see Janie in a while. She seems to like it when I come by to read to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for sharing your story with me,\u201d Trace said, genuinely touched that Nate had told him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me. Take my advice.\u201d He grinned. \u201cOtherwise, I have a feeling Mae will find some way to give me grief for failing her. That woman always did know how to nag.\u201d</p><p>Nate was still chuckling as he walked slowly toward his house. Trace watched to make sure he didn\u2019t slip on the icy patches, then walked back to Holiday Retreat, his heart somehow lighter and more certain.</p><p>Ten</p><p>For the life of her, Savannah couldn\u2019t read Trace\u2019s expression when he got back from his walk. She thought he looked more at peace with himself, but had no idea what that meant.</p><p>She was also still puzzling over his magnanimous decision to give her Aunt Mae\u2019s stock. Had that been his way of making her financially independent to ease his own conscience and rid himself of some crazy sense of obligation to look after her? Was that going to make it easier for him to pack his bags in a day or two and walk away? When he left, would he go with no intention of ever looking back on her or Holiday Retreat as anything more than a pleasant memory? If that happened, it would break Hannah\u2019s heart.</p><p>It would break Savannah\u2019s heart, too.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the turkey coming?\u201d Trace inquired, peering over her shoulder to look into the oven. \u201cIt certainly smells fantastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother hour or so,\u201d she told him, wishing he would stay right behind her, his body close to hers.</p><p>She stood up and turned slowly to face him, relieved that he didn\u2019t back away. She reached up and cupped his cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re cold. How about some hot chocolate? Or some tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said, slipping his arms around her waist. \u201cI\u2019d rather have a kiss. I\u2019m sure it would do a much better job of warming me up.\u201d</p><p>Savannah tilted her face up for his kiss. His mouth covered hers and brought her blood to a slow simmer. She couldn\u2019t be sure if it was working on Trace, but her body temperature had certainly shot up by several degrees. She sighed when he released her.</p><p>\u201cWarmer now?\u201d she inquired with forced cheer.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d he said, his eyes blazing with desire. \u201cToo bad we can\u2019t send Hannah for a ski lesson right this second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure we can\u2019t?\u201d Savannah inquired hopefully.</p><p>\u201cNope. They\u2019re all booked up at the lodge.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, biting back a chuckle. \u201cYou actually checked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I always like to know my options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have any?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, once we\u2019ve eaten, I have it on good authority that the turkey will put us straight to sleep. Maybe when we wake up, we\u2019ll have forgotten all about sneaking upstairs to be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d Trace said, his expression wry. \u201cBesides, I promised Hannah we\u2019d all go for a walk after dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth would you do that? You just got back from a walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich taught me the distracting power of exercise,\u201d he said. \u201cBesides, maybe we can have another snowball fight, and I can tackle you in the snow.\u201d</p><p>Savannah laughed. \u201cNow there\u2019s something to look forward to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, a frustrated man is willing to take any contact he can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting. I would think the chill of the snow would be counterproductive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d have to spend a month outdoors in the Arctic before it would cool the effect you have on me,\u201d he said with flattering sincerity. He tipped her chin up to look directly into her eyes. \u201cBy the way, let\u2019s make a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA date?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou know, a man and a woman, getting together. A date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut on the town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr alone in front of a cozy fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said with a surge of anticipation. \u201cWhen do you want to have this date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow night?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>The level of relief Savannah felt when she realized he intended to stay another day was scary. She had a feeling she wanted way too much from this man. Asking for a date\u2014even making love\u2014was hardly a declaration of undying devotion. She really needed to keep things in perspective and not get ahead of herself.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow would be fine. Maybe I\u2019ll see if Hannah can spend the night with Jolie again.\u201d</p><p>Trace grinned. \u201cBest idea I\u2019ve heard all day.\u201d</p><p>Savannah\u2019s heart beat a little faster at the promise beneath his words. The memory of the last night they had spent alone in this house brought a flush to her cheeks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen I will definitely make it happen,\u201d she vowed. Because she was desperate for another one of those sweet kisses despite the risk of Hannah walking in on them, she backed away from Trace and moved to the stove, opening lids and checking on things that were simmering just fine only moments ago.</p><p>\u201cTrace,\u201d she said without turning around, \u201cif I ask you something, will you tell me the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can,\u201d he said at once.</p><p>\u201cYou did make all the arrangements for Santa and the presents, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you really want to know?\u201d he asked, sounding vaguely frustrated. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you prefer to think it was part of the Christmas magic?\u201d</p><p>She turned to face him. \u201cSure,\u201d she said honestly. \u201cBut I also believe in giving credit where credit\u2019s due. I\u2019m not an eight-year-old who still believes in Santa, at least when it suits her. I know the kind of effort and money it takes to make a morning like the one we had happen. The person responsible should be thanked.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, looking as if her persistence made him uncomfortable. \u201cLook, it was nothing, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was more than that and you know it. You made Hannah\u2019s Christmas, and mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d he said. \u201cCan we drop it now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you hate admitting that you did something nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t do that much. I just made a few calls, ordered a few little things. Nate was more than willing to play Santa, especially since he had that gift from Mae for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich was wonderful of him to do, but you bought me a floor polisher and a professional-quality tool kit, for heaven\u2019s sakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of people would say that gift explains why I\u2019m still single,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I say it explains why I find you so completely and utterly irresistible,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIrresistible, huh?\u201d A grin tugged at the corners of his mouth. \u201cCome over here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t. We agreed that any more fooling around with Hannah underfoot would be a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid we agree to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did,\u201d she said emphatically.</p><p>\u201cDoes one kiss qualify as fooling around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not with a lot of people, but in my experience with you, it has a tendency to make me want a whole lot more.\u201d</p><p>His grin spread. \u201cGood to know. I\u2019ll have to remember that tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>Savannah met his gaze, her own expression deliberately solemn. \u201cI certainly hope you do.\u201d</p><p>Trace woke up in a dark mood on the morning after Christmas. Rather than inflict his foul temper on Savannah or Hannah, he made a cup of coffee, then shut himself away in Mae\u2019s den and turned on his computer.</p> <p>Even though he\u2019d given his staff the week between Christmas and New Year\u2019s off, he checked his e-mails, hoping for some lingering piece of business to distract him. Aside from some unsolicited junk mail, there was nothing. Apparently other people were still in holiday mode. He sighed and shut the thing off, then sat back, brooding.</p><p>He\u2019d spent the whole night wondering if he hadn\u2019t made the biggest blunder of his life the day before by giving Savannah that stock. It wasn\u2019t that he thought it was the wrong thing to do or that Mae would have disapproved. In fact, he was certain she\u2019d known all along what he would do with her shares. No, his concern was over whether he\u2019d given Savannah the kind of financial independence that would make her flat-out reject the proposal he planned to make tonight.</p><p>He was still brooding over that when the door to the den cracked open and Savannah peeked in.</p><p>\u201cOkay to interrupt?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, forcing the surly tone out of his voice. \u201cCome on in.\u201d</p><p>To his shock, when she walked through the door, she was wearing some sort of feminine, slinky nightgown that promptly shot his heartbeat into overdrive.</p><p>\u201cOn second thought,\u201d he muttered, his throat suddenly dry, \u201cmaybe you should change first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d She glanced down. \u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he said huskily. \u201cI like it. Maybe just a little too much.\u201d</p><p>Apparently she didn\u2019t get the hint, because she kept right on toward him. The next thing he knew, she was in his lap and his body was so hard and aching, it was all he could do to squeeze out a few words.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d he inquired, staying very still, hoping that his too-obvious response to that wicked gown of hers would magically vanish. \u201cWhere\u2019s Hannah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone,\u201d she said, brushing her mouth across his.</p><p>\u201cGone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the day,\u201d she added, peppering kisses down his neck.</p><p>\u201cThe entire day?\u201d he asked, suddenly feeling more hopeful and a whole lot less restrained.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t be home till five at the very earliest,\u201d Savannah confirmed. \u201cI have Donna\u2019s firm commitment on that. She couldn\u2019t keep her tonight, so we compromised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he murmured, sliding his hand over the slick fabric barely covering her breast. The nipple peaked at his touch.</p><p>\u201cSorry my present\u2019s a day late,\u201d she said as she proceeded to unbutton his shirt and slide it away.</p><p>Trace gasped as her mouth touched his chest. \u201cOh, darlin\u2019, something tells me it will be worth the wait.\u201d</p><p>Savannah had never felt so thoroughly cherished as she did lying on the sofa in Trace\u2019s arms, a blanket covering them, as a fire blazed across the room. In a few short days, she had discovered what it meant to be truly loved, even if Trace himself hadn\u2019t yet put a label on his feelings. She wondered if he ever would.</p><p>She turned slightly and found him studying her with a steady gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing, you know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m just a single mom doing the best I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s what I find so amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cYou remind me of my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what every woman wants to hear when she\u2019s naked in a man\u2019s arms,\u201d Savannah said lightly.</p><p>He gave her a chiding look. \u201cJust hear me out. You\u2019re strong and resilient. You\u2019ve had some tough times, but you haven\u2019t let them turn you bitter. You\u2019ve just gotten on with the business of living and making a home for Hannah. When I was a kid, I don\u2019t think I gave my mother half enough credit for that. I spent too much time being angry because she didn\u2019t tell my dad to take a hike. I realize now that she didn\u2019t see him the same way I did. She loved him, flaws and all. It was as simple as that, so she did what she could to make the best of his irresponsible ways.\u201d</p><p>Trace caressed Savannah\u2019s cheek, brushing an errant curl away from her face. \u201cSo, here\u2019s the bottom line. I meant to do this with a bit more fanfare, but since our date has turned out to be a little unorthodox, this part might as well be, too.\u201d</p><p>He sounded so serious that Savannah went still. \u201cWhat\u2019s the bottom line?\u201d she asked worriedly.</p><p>\u201cWill you marry me? I know we\u2019ve just met and that you\u2019re still recovering from a divorce, but I\u2019ve fallen in love with you. I talked it over with Nate\u2014\u201d</p><p>Savannah stared, sorting through the rush of words and seizing on those that made the least sense. \u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow don\u2019t go ballistic on me,\u201d Trace said, then rushed on. \u201cI ran into him yesterday. He saw that I had a lot on my mind, because I had all these feelings and I thought they were probably crazy, but he put it all in perspective for me. He said life is way too short to waste time looking for rational explanations for everything. I\u2019m not all that experienced with falling in love, but apparently it doesn\u2019t follow some sort of precise timetable.\u201d</p><p>Savannah\u2019s lips twitched at his vaguely disgruntled tone. \u201cNo,\u201d she agreed. \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen again, I\u2019m used to making quick decisions. And I do think it\u2019s exactly what Mae had in mind when she insisted I come here for Christmas.\u201d He met her gaze. \u201cAnd just so you know, with these quick decisions of mine, I rarely make mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Savannah said quietly. \u201cWell, it\u2019s certainly true that Aunt Mae was an incredibly wise woman. She hasn\u2019t steered me wrong so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, either,\u201d Trace said, regarding her warily. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBottom line? I\u2019ve fallen in love with you. Something tells me that if I don\u2019t reach out for what I want with you now, it will be the biggest mistake of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen reach,\u201d she said softly, her gaze locked with his.</p><p>Trace held out his hand. Savannah put hers in it, and for the first time in her life, Savannah felt as if she were truly part of a whole, something real and solid, with a future that was destined to last forever.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something about this place,\u201d she said with a sense of wonder. \u201cIt must be Aunt Mae.\u201d She lowered her mouth to Trace\u2019s. \u201cShe always did get me the best gifts of all.\u201d</p><p>UNDER THE CHRISTMAS TREE</p><p>Robyn Carr</p><p>Dear Reader,</p><p>Years ago I decided to hook a rug. Not a bath mat, but a rug about the size of Michigan. Before I got half of Detroit done, I was bored to death. Next I bought an unassembled dollhouse\u2014three stories, twelve rooms and pieces the size of toothpicks. Not such a good idea. Then came my quilting phase, which was limited to collecting boxes and boxes of colorful fabric. I took a whole day off from writing to \u201cpiece.\u201d When I showed my one-foot square to my neighbor she said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014you\u2019ll get the hang of it.\u201d</p><p>Then one day when my mind went out to play, which lucky for me is my work, it wandered up a mountain road, through some enormous trees, along a wide river in which the fish jumped, and I decided to stay awhile. I began to mentally live in a little town called Virgin River. I got to know the people and began to tell their stories. In no time at all I realized I was hooking together an ongoing story\u2014building and piecing together the fabric of their lives.</p><p>Welcome back to Virgin River for another Christmas. And this time what is found \u201cUnder the Christmas Tree\u201d not only brings the town together, but works some special magic on a couple of occasional patrons to Jack\u2019s Bar. Virgin River has a way of weaving its spell around the hearts of unsuspecting singles who pass through.</p><p>Happy holidays to all of you, and most especially to Debbie and Sherry!</p><p>One</p><p>During the Christmas holidays a side trip through Virgin River was a must; the town had recently begun erecting a thirty-foot tree in the center of town, decorated in red, white, blue and gold and topped with a great big powerful star. It dominated the little town, and people came from miles around to see it. The patriotic theme of the decorations set it apart from all other trees. Local bar owner Jack Sheridan joked that he expected to see the three wise men any minute, that star was so bright. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Annie McKenzie didn\u2019t pass through Virgin River very often. It was out of her way when driving from Fortuna, where she lived, to her parents\u2019 farm near Alder Point. It was a cute little town and she liked it there, especially the bar and grill owned by Jack Sheridan. People there met you once, maybe twice, and from that point on, treated you like an old friend.</p><p>She was on her way to her folks\u2019 place when, at the last moment, she decided to detour through Virgin River. Since it was the week after Thanksgiving, she hoped they\u2019d started on the tree. It was a calm and sunny Monday afternoon and very cold, but her heart warmed when she pulled into town and saw that the tree was up and decorated. Jack was up on an A-frame ladder straightening out some trimmings, and standing at the foot of the ladder, looking up, was Christopher, the six-year-old son of Jack\u2019s cook, Preacher.</p><p>Annie got out of her truck and walked over. \u201cHey, Jack,\u201d she yelled up. \u201cLooking good!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie! Haven\u2019t seen you in a while. How are your folks?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re great. And your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He looked around. \u201cUh-oh. David?\u201d he called. Then he looked at Christopher as he climbed down the ladder. \u201cChris, you were going to help keep an eye on him. Where did he go? David?\u201d he called again.</p><p>Then Chris called, \u201cDavid! David!\u201d</p><p>They both walked around the tree, checked the bar porch and the backyard, calling his name. Annie stood there, not sure whether to help or just stay out of their way, when the lowest boughs of the great tree moved and a little tyke about three years old crawled out.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d Annie asked. He was holding something furry in his mittened hands and she got down on her knees. \u201cWhatcha got there, buddy?\u201d she asked. And then she yelled, \u201cFound him, Jack!\u201d</p> <p>The child was holding a baby animal of some kind, and it looked awfully young and listless. Its fur was black and white, its eyes were closed, and it hung limply in little David\u2019s hands. She just hoped the boy hadn\u2019t squeezed the life out of it; boys were not known for gentleness. \u201cLet me have a look, honey,\u201d she said, taking the creature out of his hands. She held it up and its little head lolled. Unmistakably a puppy. A brand-new puppy.</p><p>Jack came running around the tree. \u201cWhere was he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder the tree. And he came out with this,\u201d she said, showing him the animal very briefly before stuffing it under her sweater between her T-shirt and her wool sweater, up against the warmth of her body. Then she pulled her down vest around herself to hold him in place. \u201cPoor little thing might be frozen, or almost frozen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, David, where\u2019d you find him?\u201d</p><p>David just pointed at Annie. \u201cMy boppie!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s right,\u201d Annie said. \u201cIt\u2019s a boppie.....er, puppy. But it\u2019s not very old. Not old enough to have gotten out of a house or a yard. This little guy should\u2019ve been in a box with his mom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDavid, hold Chris\u2019s hand,\u201d Jack ordered.</p><p>And David said something in his language that could be translated into I want my puppy! But Jack was on his belly on the cold ground, crawling under the tree. And from under there Annie heard a muffled \u201cAw, crap!\u201d And then he backed out, pulling a box full of black-and-white puppies.</p><p>Annie and Jack just stared at each other for a moment. Then Annie said, \u201cBetter get \u2019em inside by the fire. Puppies this young can die in the cold real fast. This could turn out badly.\u201d</p><p>Jack hefted the box. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s gonna turn out badly! I\u2019m gonna find out who would do something so awful and take him apart!\u201d Then he turned to the boys and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go, guys.\u201d He carried the box to the bar porch and Annie rushed past him to hold the door open. \u201cI mean, there are animal shelters, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><p>The fire was ablaze in the hearth and there were a couple of guys dressed like hunters at the bar, sharing a pitcher of beer and playing cribbage. She patted the place by the hearth and Jack put down the box. Annie immediately began checking out the puppies. \u201cI\u2019m gonna need a little help here, Jack. Can you warm up some towels in the clothes dryer? I could use a couple more warm hands. There\u2019s not enough wriggling around in this box to give me peace of mind.\u201d Then suddenly, she herself began wriggling. She smiled a big smile. \u201cMine\u2019s coming around,\u201d she said, patting the lump under her sweater.</p><p>Annie kneeled before the box, and David and Chris squeezed in right beside her. She took the wriggling puppy out from under her sweater, put him in the box and picked up another one. At least there was a blanket under them and they had their shared warmth, she thought. She put another one under her sweater.</p><p>\u201cWhatcha got there?\u201d someone asked.</p><p>She looked over her shoulder. The hunters from the bar had wandered over to the hearth, peering into the box. \u201cSomeone left a box of newborn puppies under the Christmas tree. They\u2019re half-frozen.\u201d She picked up two more, made sure they were moving and handed them over. \u201cHere, put these two inside your shirt, warm \u2019em up, see if they come around.\u201d She picked up two more, checked them and handed them to the other man. The men did exactly as she told them, and she stuffed one more under her sweater.</p> <p>Then she picked up a puppy that went limp in her palm. \u201cUh-oh,\u201d she muttered. She jostled him a little, but he didn\u2019t move. She covered his tiny mouth and nose with her mouth and pushed a gentle breath into him. She massaged his little chest gently. Rubbed his extremities, breathed into him again and he curled up in her palm. \u201cBetter,\u201d she murmured, stuffing him under her shirt.</p><p>\u201cDid you just resuscitate that puppy?\u201d one of the hunters asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said. \u201cI did that to an orphaned kitten once and it worked, so what the heck, huh? Man, there are eight of these little guys,\u201d she said. \u201cBig litter. At least they have fur, but they are so young. Couple of weeks, I bet. And puppies are so vulnerable to the cold. They have to be kept warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoppie!\u201d David cried, trying to get his little hands into the box.</p><p>\u201cYup, you found a box full of boppies, David,\u201d Annie said. She picked up the last puppy\u2014the first one she\u2019d warmed\u2014and held it up to the hunters. \u201cCan anyone fit one more in a warm place?\u201d</p><p>One of the men took the puppy and put it under his arm. \u201cYou a vet or something?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019m a farm girl. I grew up not too far from here. Every once in a while we\u2019d have a litter or a foal or a calf the mother couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t take care of. Rare, but it happens. Usually you better not get between a mother and her babies, but sometimes.....Well, the first thing is body temperature, and at least these guys have some good fur. The next thing is food.\u201d She stuck her hand into the box and felt the blanket they\u2019d been snuggled on. \u201cHmm, it\u2019s dry. No urine or scat\u2014which is not so good. Besides being really cold, they\u2019re probably starving by now. Maybe getting dehydrated. Puppies nurse a lot and they were obviously taken from the mother\u2019s whelp box.\u201d</p><p>Jack reappeared, Preacher close on his heels. Preacher was tall enough that he was looking over Jack\u2019s shoulder into the empty box. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Preacher asked.</p><p>\u201cDad! David found a box full of puppies under the tree! They\u2019re freezing cold! They could be dying!\u201d Christopher informed him desperately.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re warming \u2019em up,\u201d Annie said, indicating her and the hunters\u2019 lumpy shirts. \u201cAbout half of them are wriggling and we\u2019ll know about the other half in a little bit. Meanwhile, we need to get some fluids and nourishment into them. They shouldn\u2019t be off the tit this young. Infant formula and cereal would be ideal, but we can make due with some warm milk and watered-down oatmeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFormula?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cI bet I can manage that. You remember my wife, Mel. She\u2019s the midwife. She\u2019ll have some infant formula on hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfect. And if she has a little rice cereal or baby oatmeal, better still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we need bottles?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Annie said. \u201cA couple of shallow bowls will work. They\u2019re young, but I bet they\u2019re awful hungry. They\u2019ll catch on real quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d one of the hunters said. \u201cGot me a wiggler!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too!\u201d the other one said.</p><p>\u201cKeep \u2019em next to your body for a while,\u201d Annie ordered. \u201cAt least until we get those warm towels in the box.\u201d</p><p>Because of a box full of cold, hungry, barely moving puppies, Annie had all but forgotten the reason she\u2019d ended up in Virgin River. It was three weeks till Christmas and her three older brothers, their wives and their kids would descend on her parents\u2019 farm for the holiday. Today was one of her two days off a week from the beauty shop. Yesterday, Sunday, she\u2019d baked with her mom all day and today she\u2019d gotten up early to make a couple of big casseroles her mom could freeze for the holiday company. Today, she\u2019d planned to cook with her mom, maybe take one of her two horses out for a ride and say hello to Erasmus, her blue-ribbon bull. Erasmus was very old now and every hello could be the last. Then she\u2019d planned to stay for dinner with her folks, something she did at least once a week. Being the youngest and only unmarried one of the McKenzie kids and also the only one who lived nearby, the task of looking in on Mom and Dad fell to her.</p><p>But here she was, hearthside, managing a box of newborn puppies. Jack rustled up the formula and cereal and a couple of warm towels from the dryer. Preacher provided the shallow bowls and mixed up the formula. She and Chris fed a couple of puppies at a time, coaxing them to lap up the food. She requisitioned an eyedropper from the medical clinic across the street for the pups who didn\u2019t catch on to lapping up dinner.</p><p>Jack put in a call to a fellow he knew who was a veterinarian, and it turned out Annie knew him, too. Old Doc Jensen had put in regular appearances out at the farm since before she was born. Back in her dad\u2019s younger days, he\u2019d kept a thriving but small dairy farm. Lots of cows, a few horses, dogs and cats, goats and one ornery old bull. Jensen was a large-animal vet, but he\u2019d be able to at least check out these puppies.</p><p>Annie asked Jack to also give her mom a call and explain what was holding her up. Her mom would laugh, knowing her daughter so well. Nothing would pry Annie away from a box of needy newborn puppies.</p><p>As the dinner hour approached, she couldn\u2019t help but notice that the puppies were drawing a crowd. People stopped by where she sat at the hearth, asked for the story, reached into the box to ruffle the soft fur or even pick up a puppy. Annie wasn\u2019t sure so much handling was a good idea, but as long as she could keep the little kids, particularly David, from mishandling them, she felt she\u2019d at least won the battle if not the war.</p><p>\u201cThis bar has needed mascots for a long time,\u201d someone said.</p><p>\u201cEight of \u2019em. Donner, Prancer, Comet, Vixen, and.....whoever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one is Comet?\u201d Chris asked. \u201cDad? Can I have Comet?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. We operate an eating-and-drinking establishment,\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>\u201cAwww, Dad! Dad, come on. Please, Dad. I\u2019ll do everything. I\u2019ll sleep with him. I\u2019ll make sure he\u2019s nice. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristopher.....\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Please? I never asked for anything before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou ask for everything, as a matter of fact,\u201d Preacher corrected him. \u201cAnd get most of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy shouldn\u2019t grow up without a dog,\u201d someone said.</p><p>\u201cTeaches responsibility and discipline,\u201d was another comment.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like he\u2019d be in the kitchen all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI run a ranch. Little hair in the potatoes never put me off.\u201d Laughter sounded all around.</p> <p>Four of the eight pups were doing real well; they were wriggling around with renewed strength and had lapped up some of the formula thickened with cereal. Two were trying to recover from what was certainly hunger and hypothermia; Annie managed to get a little food into them with an eyedropper. Two others were breathing, their hearts beating, but not only were they small, they were weak and listless. She dripped a little food into their tiny mouths and then tucked them under her shirt to keep them warm, hoping they might mistake her for their mother for now, all the time wondering if old Doc Jensen would ever show.</p><p>When yet another gust of wind blew in the opened front door, Annie momentarily forgot all about the puppies. Some of the best male eye candy she\u2019d chanced upon in a long while had just walked into Jack\u2019s bar. He looked vaguely familiar, too. She wondered if maybe she\u2019d seen him in a movie or on TV or something. He walked right up to the bar, and Jack greeted him enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cHey, Nate! How\u2019s it going? You get those plane tickets yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took care of that a long time ago.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to this forever. Before too long I\u2019m going to be lying on a Nassau beach in the middle of a hundred string bikinis. I dream about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of those Club Med things?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d He laughed again. \u201cA few people from school. I haven\u2019t seen most of them in years. We hardly keep in touch, but one of them put this holiday together and, since I was available, it sounded like an excellent idea. The guy who made the arrangements got one of those all-inclusive hotel deals\u2014food, drinks, everything included except activities like deep-sea fishing or scuba diving\u2014for when I\u2019m not just lying on the sand, looking around at beautiful women in tiny bathing suits.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood for you,\u201d Jack said. \u201cBeer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind if I do,\u201d Nate replied. And then, like the answer to a prayer she didn\u2019t even know she\u2019d uttered, he carried his beer right over to where she sat with the box of puppies. \u201cHello,\u201d he said.</p><p>She swallowed, looking up. It was hard to tell how tall he was from her sitting position, but certainly over six feet. Annie noticed things like that because she was tall. His hair was dark brown; his eyes were an even darker brown and surrounded with loads of thick black lashes. Her mother called eyes like that \u201cbedroom eyes.\u201d He lifted his brows as he looked down at her. Then he smiled and revealed a dimple in one cheek.</p><p>\u201cI said hello,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>She coughed herself out of her stupor. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>He frowned slightly. \u201cHey, I think you cut my hair once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossible. That\u2019s what I do for a living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you did,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat was the problem with the haircut?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t know that there was a problem,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you come back?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cOkay, we argued about the stuff you wanted to put in it. I didn\u2019t want it, you told me I did. You won and I went out of there looking all spiky. When I touched my head, it was like I had meringue in my hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProduct,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe call it product. It\u2019s in style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? I\u2019m not, I guess,\u201d he said, sitting down on the raised hearth on the other side of the box. He reached in and picked up a puppy. \u201cI don\u2019t like product in my hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hands clean?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He gave her a startled look. Then his eyes slowly wandered from her face to her chest and he smiled slightly. \u201cUm, I think you\u2019re moving,\u201d he said. \u201cOr maybe you\u2019re just very excited to meet me.\u201d And then he grinned playfully.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re funny,\u201d Annie replied, reaching under her sweater to pull out a tiny squirming animal. \u201cYou make up that line all by your little self?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head and took the puppy out of her hands. \u201cI\u2019d say at least part border collie. Looks like mostly border collie, but they can take on other characteristics as they get older. Cute,\u201d he observed. \u201cPlenty of pastoral breeds around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose two are the weakest of the bunch, so please be careful. I\u2019m waiting for the vet.\u201d</p><p>He balanced two little puppies in one big hand and pulled a pair of glasses out of the pocket of his suede jacket. \u201cI\u2019m the vet.\u201d He slipped on his glasses and, holding both pups upside down, looked at their eyes, mouth, ears and pushed on their bellies with a finger.</p><p>She was speechless for a minute. \u201cYou\u2019re not old Doc Jensen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathaniel Junior,\u201d he said. \u201cNate. You know my father?\u201d he asked, still concentrating on the puppies. He put them in the box and picked up two more, repeating the process.</p><p>\u201cHe.....ah.....My folks have a farm down by Alder Point. Hey! I grew up there! Not all that far from Doc\u2019s clinic and stable. Shouldn\u2019t I know you?\u201d</p><p>He looked over the tops of his glasses. \u201cI don\u2019t know. How old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there you go. I\u2019m thirty-two. Got a few years on you. Where\u2019d you go to school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFortuna. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cValley.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI guess you can call me old Doc Jensen now.\u201d And there was that grin again. No way he could have grown up within fifty miles of her farm without her knowing him. He was too delicious-looking.</p><p>\u201cI have older brothers,\u201d she said. \u201cBeau, Brad and Jim McKenzie. All older than you.\u201d</p><p>At first he was startled at this news, then he broke into a wide smile. Then he laughed. \u201cAre you that skinny, fuzzy-haired, freckle-faced, tin-mouthed pain in the neck who always followed Beau and Brad around?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed and she glared at him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cThat must have been someone else. Your hair isn\u2019t pumpkin orange. And you\u2019re not all that.....\u201d He paused for a second, then said, \u201cGot your braces off, I see.\u201d By her frown, he realized he hadn\u2019t scored with that comment.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your father? I want a second opinion!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re not so skinny anymore, either.\u201d He smiled, proud of himself.</p><p>\u201cVery, very old joke, sparky,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re out of luck, cupcake. My mom and dad finally realized a dream come true and moved to Arizona where they could have horses and be warm and pay lower taxes. One of my older sisters lives there with her family. I\u2019ve got another sister in Southern California and another one in Nevada. I\u2019m the new old Doc Jensen.\u201d</p><p>Now it was coming back to her\u2014Doc Jensen had kids, all older than she was. Too much older for her to have known them in school. But she did vaguely remember the son who came with him to the farm on rare occasions. One corner of her mouth quirked up in a half grin. \u201cAre you that little, pimply, tin-mouthed runt with the squeaky voice who came out to the farm with your dad sometimes?\u201d</p><p>He frowned and made a sound. \u201cI was a late bloomer,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>Nate was now checking out his third set of puppies.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I remember you better?\u201d she mused aloud.</p><p>\u201cI went to Catholic school down in Oakland my junior and senior year. I wasn\u2019t going to get into a good college without some serious academic help, and those Jesuits live to get their hands on a challenge like me. They turned me around. And I grew five inches my first year of college.\u201d He put down the puppies he\u2019d been holding and picked up the first one. He became serious. She noticed a definite kindness, a softness, in his expression. \u201cAnnie, isn\u2019t it? Or do you go by Anne now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie. McKenzie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Annie, this little guy is real weak. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll make it.\u201d</p><p>A very sad look came into her eyes as she took the puppy from him and tucked him under her sweater again.</p><p>Nodding at her, Nate said, \u201cAs much incentive as that is to live, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll do. How long were these guys outside before someone found them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows. Probably since before sunrise. Jack was in and out all day, fussing with the tree, and he never saw anyone. His little boy crawled under the tree and came out holding a puppy. That\u2019s how we found them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s the plan now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cWant me to drop them off at a shelter for you? Then you don\u2019t have to witness the bad news if one or two don\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s probably a bad idea. Some of the shelters over on the Coast are excellent, but you know what it\u2019s like this time of year. All those people adopting cute puppies for Christmas presents and then returning them in January. And returning them is the good scenario. All too often they\u2019re neglected or abused. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to take care of them until reliable homes can be found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho, Annie?\u201d he asked. \u201cWho\u2019s going to take care of them?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI have a small house in Fortuna and I work all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the farm?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She was shaking her head before he finished. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. My dad\u2019s arthritis is bad enough that he slowly sold off the stock and my mom runs around like a crazy woman taking care of all the things that wear him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad\u2019s Hank McKenzie, right? He gets around pretty good for someone with bad arthritis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s proud. He doesn\u2019t let on. But it would fall to my mom and I can\u2019t ask her to take on eight puppies. And the whole family is coming home to the farm for Christmas. All thirteen of \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Annie, I can\u2019t think of many options here,\u201d he said. \u201cI know a few vets in the towns around here and I don\u2019t know one that would take this on. They\u2019d put \u2019em in a no-kill shelter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you help? You and your wife?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cNo wife, Annie McKenzie. I have a real nice vet tech who\u2019s going to keep an eye on the stable while I\u2019m out of town over Christmas, but that\u2019s the only help I have out there, and she doesn\u2019t have time to add eight puppies to her roster.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJack!\u201d Annie called. She stood up. \u201cCan you come here?\u201d</p><p>Jack ambled over, wiping his hands on a towel.</p><p>\u201cWe have a situation, Jack,\u201d Annie said. \u201cDr. Jensen can\u2019t take the puppies and get them through this rough patch. He offered to drop them off at a shelter, but really, that\u2019s not a great idea.\u201d A couple of people had wandered over to listen in to the conversation, eavesdropping and making no bones about it. \u201cI\u2019ve volunteered at some of those shelters and they\u2019re awesome, but they\u2019re really, really busy at Christmastime. A lot of animals get adopted for presents, especially the really young, cute ones like these. You have no idea how many people think they want a fluffy pet for little Susie or Billie\u2014until the first time the dog thinks the carpet is grass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Jack said, confused. A couple more people had wandered over from the bar to listen in to the conference.</p> <p>Annie took a breath. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough animals get returned. The worst case is they\u2019re not taken care of properly, get neglected or abused or get sick and aren\u2019t taken to the vet because the vet costs money. Sometimes people are embarrassed to return them and admit it was a mistake. Then they just take them to animal control, where they\u2019re on death row for three days before.....\u201d She stopped. \u201cIt can be a bad situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what are you gonna do?\u201d Jack said. \u201cBetter odds than freezing to death under a Christmas tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could take care of them here, Jack,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d he mimicked, lifting a brow. \u201cI see you about four times a year, Annie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive up after work every day. They\u2019re kind of labor-intensive right now, but I\u2019ll tell you exactly what to do and you can get\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhoa, Annie, whoa. I can\u2019t keep dogs in the bar!\u201d</p><p>An old woman put a hand on Jack\u2019s arm. \u201cWe already named \u2019em, Jack,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter Santa\u2019s reindeer. At least the ones we could remember. Little Christopher already asked Preacher if he could have Comet. \u2019Course no one knows who Comet is yet, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no mother to clean up after them,\u201d Nate pointed out. \u201cThat means puppy excrement. Times eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, that\u2019s just great,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t panic,\u201d Annie said. \u201cHere\u2019s what you do. Get a nice, big wooden box or big plastic laundry basket. You could even put a wooden border around a plastic pad from an old playpen, then toss an old blanket or a couple of towels over it. Pull the blanket back to feed \u2019em the formula and cereal every few hours. Or feed a couple or three at a time outside the box so you can wipe up the floor. Trade the dirty towels for clean ones, wash one set while you use the other, and vice versa. Oh, and at least two of these little guys need a lot of encouragement to eat\u2014the eyedropper gets \u2019em going. I could take the littlest, weakest ones to a vet but, Jack, they\u2019re better off with their litter mates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, f\u2019chrissake, Annie,\u201d Jack moaned.</p> <p>\u201cYou can just grab someone at the bar and ask them to take a couple of minutes to coax some food into a sick puppy,\u201d she said hopefully.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d the old woman said as she pushed her glasses up on her nose. \u201cI\u2019ll commit to a puppy or two a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie, I can\u2019t wash towels with puppy shit on \u2019em in the same washer we use for napkins for the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we did at the farm. My mom sterilized a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cBet you washed shitty baby clothes in the same.....Never mind. If you just get the towels, bag \u2019em up in a big plastic bag, I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll come out after work and spell you a little, take home your dirty laundry, bring back fresh every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Annie,\u201d he said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Annie returned. \u201cPeople will love it, keeping an eye on \u2019em, watching \u2019em plump up. By Christmas, all of them will be spoken for, and by people who know what to do with animals. These little guys will probably turn into some outstanding herders around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathaniel, did you put her up to this?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>Nate put up his hands and shook his head. He didn\u2019t say so, but she did have a point. Adopted by a town, these puppies would get looked after.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t say yes or no without Preacher,\u201d Jack said, going off to the kitchen.</p><p>Annie smiled crookedly as she listened to the people who had followed Jack to the hearth, muttering to each other that, sure, this plan could work. They wouldn\u2019t mind holding a puppy every now and then, maybe donating a blanket, getting a puppy to eat, wiping up the floor here and there.</p><p>When Preacher trailed Jack back to the box of puppies, his six-year-old son was close on his heels. Jack tried to speak very softly about what all this would entail, but Christopher didn\u2019t miss a syllable. He tugged at Preacher\u2019s sleeve and in a very small voice he said, \u201cPlease, Dad, please. I\u2019ll help every day. I\u2019ll feed and hold and clean up and I won\u2019t miss anything.\u201d</p><p>Preacher pulled his heavy black brows together in a fierce scowl. Then, letting out an exasperated sigh, he crouched to get to eye level with the boy. \u201cChris, there can never be a dog in the kitchen. You hear me, son? And we have to start looking for homes right away, because some may be ready to leave the litter sooner than others. This has to be real temporary. We prepare food here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Chris said. \u201cExcept Comet. Comet\u2019s going to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still thinking about that. And I\u2019ll have to look up on the computer how you take care of a bunch of orphaned pups like these guys,\u201d Preacher added.</p><p>Annie let a small laugh escape as she plucked the smallest, weakest puppy from under her sweater and put him back in the box. \u201cWell, my work here is done,\u201d she said with humor in her voice. \u201cI\u2019ll try to cut my day as short as I can at the shop, Jack. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie, they\u2019re not your responsibility,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou\u2019ve already been a huge help. I don\u2019t really expect you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to turn my back on them now,\u201d she said. \u201cYou might panic and take them to the pound.\u201d She grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Two</p><p>The puppies were found on Monday and Nate managed to stay away from the bar on Tuesday, but by Wednesday he was back there right about dinnertime. He told himself he had a vested interest\u2014they might be about a hundredth the size of his usual patients, but he had more or less treated them. At least he\u2019d looked at them and judged the care Annie recommended to be acceptable. In which case he didn\u2019t really need to check on them. But Jack\u2019s was a decent place to get a beer at the end of the day, and that fire was nice and cozy after a long day of tromping around farms and ranches, rendering treatment for horses, cows, goats, sheep, bulls and whatever other livestock was ailing.</p><p>But then there was Annie.</p><p>She was no longer a skinny, flat-chested, fuzzy-haired metal-mouth. Something he\u2019d been reminding himself of for more than twenty-four hours. The jury was still out on whether she was a pain in the butt. He suspected she was.</p><p>She was tall for a woman\u2014at least five-ten in her stocking feet\u2014with very long legs. That carrot top was no longer bright orange\u2014maybe the miracle of Miss Clairol had done the trick. In any case, her hair was a dark auburn she wore in a simple but elegant cut that framed her face. It was sleek and silky and swayed when her head moved. Her eyes were almost exotic\u2014dark brown irises framed by black lashes and slanting shapely brows. And there was a smattering of youthful freckles sprinkled over her nose and cheeks, just enough to make her cute. But that mouth, that full, pink, soft mouth\u2014that was gonna kill him. He hadn\u2019t seen a mouth like that on a woman in a long time. It was spectacular.</p><p>She was a little bossy, but he liked that in a woman. He wondered if he should seek therapy for that. But no\u2014he thrived on the challenge of it. Growing up with three older sisters, he\u2019d been fighting for his life against determined females his entire life. Meek and docile women had never appealed to him and he blamed Patricia, Susan and Christina for that.</p><p>The very first thing Nate noticed when he walked into the bar on Wednesday was that Annie was not there. He smiled with superiority. Hah! He should have known. She talked Jack and Preacher into keeping eight tiny puppies\u2014a labor-intensive job\u2014promising to help, and was a no-show. He went over to the box and counted them. Seven. Then he went up to the bar.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jack,\u201d he said. \u201cLose one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Jack said, giving the counter a wipe. \u201cOh, no.\u201d He laughed and shook his head. \u201cAnnie took one back to Preacher\u2019s laundry room for a little fluff and buff. He mussed his diaper, if you get my drift. It\u2019s the littlest, weakest one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Nate responded, almost embarrassed by his assumption. \u201cHe hanging in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. And wouldn\u2019t you know\u2014Christopher has decided that that one is his. Comet. Annie tried to talk him into falling in love with a stronger, heartier pup, but the boy\u2019s drawn to the one most likely not to make it.\u201d</p><p>Nate just laughed. \u201cIt was that way for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI was older, though. We had the most beautiful Australian Kelpie\u2014chocolate brown, silky coat, sweet face, ran herd on everything. My dad had her bred and promised me a pup. Out of her litter of six, I picked the runt and practically had to hand-feed him for weeks. The other pups kept pushing him off the tit. I was fifteen and, probably not coincidentally, also small for my age. I named him Dingo. He was big and tough by the time I was through with him, and he lived a long life for a hardworking Kelpie. We lost him just a few years ago. He lived to be fifteen. \u2019Course, he spent his last four years lying by the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think a boy would pick the strongest in the pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d Nate snorted. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel that strong, so we empathize. Can I trouble you for a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Nate\u2014I wasn\u2019t thinking. Fact is, I\u2019ve been sitting on our nest on and off all day. I have a whole new appreciation for what you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave they been a lot of trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not really, just time-consuming,\u201d Jack said. \u201cThey eat every three hours or so, then their bedding has to be changed, then they nap, then they eat. And so on. Kind of like regular babies. Except there are eight of them and half of them need encouragement to eat. Plus, every so often, you have to check that they\u2019re not too warm or too cold. I don\u2019t want to freeze \u2019em or cook \u2019em. And the bar\u2019s getting lots more company during the day\u2014visitors to the litter. Since they\u2019re here, they decide to eat and drink\u2014more serving, cooking and cleanup than usual. Other than that, piece of cake. And if I ever find the SOB that left \u2019em under the tree, I\u2019m going to string him up by his\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, hey, Doc Jensen,\u201d a female voice sang out.</p><p>Nate turned to see Annie come out the back of the bar, Christopher trailing so closely that if she stopped suddenly, he\u2019d have crashed into her. She carried a furry ball of black and white that fit perfectly into her palm. Looking at her, he realized he hadn\u2019t remembered her quite accurately. Or rather, quite enough. Tall, curvaceous, high cheekbones, soft dark auburn hair swinging along her jaw, long delicate fingers.....She was beautiful. And her figure in a pair of snug jeans and turquoise hoodie with a deep V-neck just knocked him out. Where the heck had this girl been hiding?</p><p>And why was he, a man who could appreciate cleavage and tiny bikinis, suddenly seeing the merits in jeans, boots and hoodies?</p><p>Then he remembered she\u2019d been hiding in a little hair salon in Fortuna, under a pink smock.</p> <p>He picked up his beer and wandered over to the hearth. Christopher and Annie sat on opposite sides of the box, which left no place for him, so he stood there in the middle.</p><p>Annie passed Chris the puppy. \u201cHold him for just a minute, then snuggle him back in with his brothers and sisters,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s good for him to be part of his family. They give him more comfort than we can right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little maintenance?\u201d Nate asked.</p><p>Annie looked up at him and smiled. \u201cThis is the part that gets to be a bother\u2014without a mother dog to change their diapers and keep them clean, by the end of the day they\u2019re looking a little worse for wear. Some of them actually needed washing up. My dad always used to say a little poop never hurt a puppy, but you let that go long enough and it will. Gets them all ugly and matted and sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bathed him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFour of them, without dunking them,\u201d she said. \u201cCan\u2019t let them get cold. Preacher\u2019s wife loaned her blow-dryer to the cause. Okay, Chris, he\u2019s been away from home long enough now.\u201d She reached into the box and pushed some puppies aside to make room, and Chris gently put his puppy into the pile. \u201cThey\u2019ll be ready to eat again in about an hour. Why don\u2019t you get back to your homework, or dinner, or chores, or whatever your folks have in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Annie,\u201d he said.</p><p>And Nate fought a smile as Chris vacated his place on the hearth. But before he sat down he asked Annie, \u201cCan I buy you a beer? Or something else?\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head and smiled at him. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind a beer, thanks.\u201d He was back with a cold one for her in just moments and sat down opposite her. \u201cI think they\u2019re doing okay here,\u201d she said to him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a hardhearted guy, but he only pretended interest in the pups, picking one up and then another, looking at their little faces. He\u2019d rather be looking at her, but didn\u2019t want to seem obvious. \u201cWere you here yesterday?\u201d he asked, studying a puppy, rather than her.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d she said, sipping her beer. \u201cAh, that\u2019s very nice. Thanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou planning to come every day?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIf I can swing it,\u201d she said. \u201cI kind of made a deal\u2014if they wouldn\u2019t hand them over to some shelter, I\u2019d do my part. These little guys are just too cute and vulnerable. They could turn into impetuous Christmas presents, no matter how carefully the shelter volunteers screen the potential owners. And look at their markings\u2014I\u2019d say Australian-shepherd-and-border-collie mix. Outstanding herders. They should find good homes around here, and they\u2019ll be glad to work for a living.\u201d</p><p>Nate lifted his eyebrows. \u201cGood guess,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get off work before five?\u201d he found himself asking.</p><p>\u201cNot usually. I have a small shop in Fortuna\u2014six chairs. It\u2019s a franchise\u2014my franchise. So I\u2019m responsible, plus I have a large client list and it\u2019s Christmastime. But I\u2019m moving appointments around the best I can\u2014a few of my clients will take another stylist in a pinch. And I\u2019ve been training an assistant manager, so she\u2019s getting thrown into the deep end of the pool because of these puppies. And I\u2019m doing my puppy laundry and paperwork at midnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of paperwork?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThe kind you have with a small business\u2014receipts, receivables, bills, payroll. Jack and Preacher are managing real well during the day when it\u2019s sort of quiet around here, but when it gets busy at the dinner hour, they need a hand. And you heard Jack\u2014he\u2019s not washing puppy sheets with his napkins.\u201d She smiled and sipped her beer. \u201cWe should all take comfort in that, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d He smiled. \u201cHow\u2019d you end up with a beauty shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s not interesting. I\u2019d rather hear about what you do. I grew up around animals and being a vet is my fantasy life. You\u2019re living my dream.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you pursue it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, for starters, I had exactly two years of college and my GPA was above average, but we both know it takes way more than that to get into veterinary college. Isn\u2019t it harder to get into veterinary college than medical school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I hear,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, after two years of college.....?\u201d</p><p>She laughed and sipped her beer. \u201cOne of my part-time jobs was grooming dogs. I loved it. Loved it. The only thing I didn\u2019t love was going home a grimy, filthy mess and not exactly getting rich. But I saw the potential and needed to make a living. I couldn\u2019t focus on a course of study in college, so I went to beauty school, worked a few years, hit my folks up for a loan to buy a little shop, and there you have it. I do hair on two-legged clients now. And it\u2019s working just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your love of animals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stop by this little bar every evening and babysit a bunch of orphaned puppies for a few hours,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI still have a couple of horses at the farm. My dad got rid of the livestock years ago except for Erasmus, a very old, very lazy, very ill-tempered bull who my dad says will outlive us all. They\u2019re down to two dogs, my mom keeps some chickens and their summer garden is just amazing. But it was once a thriving dairy farm, plus he grew alfalfa and silage for feed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t it still a thriving farm?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo one to run it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brothers don\u2019t want the farm life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d she said. \u201cOne\u2019s a high-school teacher and coach, one\u2019s a physical therapist in sports medicine and one\u2019s a CPA. All married with kids and working wives. All moved to bigger towns. And the closest one lives a few hours away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you. You sound like you love the farm. You love animals. You still have a couple of horses at your parents\u2019 farm......\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019d be real happy to take on the farm, but that\u2019s not a good idea. Not the best place for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? If you like it.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head and smirked. \u201cSingle, twenty-eight-year-old woman, living with Mom and Dad on the farm, building up the herd and plowing the fields. Picture it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s always help,\u201d he said. \u201cHired hands for the rough stuff.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cRough stuff doesn\u2019t scare me, but I can\u2019t think of a better way to guarantee I\u2019ll turn into an old maid. My social life is dull enough, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are ways around that,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cTrips. Vacations. Visitors. That sort of thing. Something to break up the isolation a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2014that\u2019s what I heard. Before I knew who you were, I heard Jack ask you if you had your plane tickets yet and you said something about Nassau, a Club Med vacation and lots of string bikinis. Right?\u201d</p><p>For some reason he couldn\u2019t explain, that embarrassed him slightly. \u201cNo, no. I don\u2019t know anything about that Club Med stuff. A buddy of mine, Jerry from vet school, set up a get-together over Christmas with our old study group. We\u2019ve only been in touch by e-mail and haven\u2019t been together since graduation. The Nassau part is fact, the string-bikinis part is fantasy. I\u2019m planning to do some scuba diving, snorkeling, some fishing. I haven\u2019t been away in a while.\u201d He laughed. \u201cFrankly, I haven\u2019t been warm in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get together with your family over the holidays?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, they were gracious enough to invite me to join them all on a cruise. All of them,\u201d he stressed. \u201cMy folks, three sisters and brothers-in-law, four nephews and two nieces. It\u2019s going to be hell to give up all that shuffleboard, but I\u2019ll manage somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they ever come back here?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou know\u2014to the old homestead? Where you all grew up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrequently. They move in, take over, and I move out to the stable and take up residence in the vet tech\u2019s quarters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and the tech must be on very good terms.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cShe\u2019s married and lives in Clear River, but we keep quarters for her for those times we have cases that are going to need attention through the night. She was my dad\u2019s assistant before he retired. She\u2019s like a member of the family.\u201d Then he studied her face. Was that relief? \u201cThe family was all home for Thanksgiving,\u201d he went on to explain. \u201cIt was great to see them all, and boy was I glad when they left. It\u2019s madness. I have really good brothers-in-law, though. At least my sisters did that much for me.\u201d</p><p>She sipped her beer. \u201cYou must be looking forward to your vacation. When do you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe twenty-third. Till the second of January. I plan to come home tanned and rested.\u201d And with any luck, he thought, sexually relaxed. Then he instantly felt his face grow hot and thought, Why the hell did I think that? He wasn\u2019t typically casual about sex. He was actually very serious about it.</p><p>Annie peered at him strangely. \u201cDr. Jensen, are you blushing?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so formal, Annie. Nate is fine. Is it a little warm by this fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t noticed, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I hadn\u2019t even thought about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s grab that table, right there close by, before anyone else gets it. I\u2019m going to tell Jack we want dinner. How about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cThat sounds fine. By the time we\u2019re finished, Chris will be back, ready to feed his puppy.\u201d</p><p>Through the rest of that first week the puppies seemed to do just fine. Thrived in fact. So did Annie, and she hoped it didn\u2019t show all over her face. There was no particular reason for Nate to show up day after day; the pups weren\u2019t sick, didn\u2019t need medical care and he hadn\u2019t made the commitment to help that she had. Yet he returned on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. She\u2019d love to believe he was there to see her, but it seemed such a farfetched idea. So highly unlikely that she could interest a man like him through this odd doggie-day-care-in-a-bar that she wouldn\u2019t allow herself to even think about it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he was there by six every day, right about the time she finished her puppy chores. He always bought her a beer, then Jack provided dinner, which they ate together at a table near the hearth. They talked and laughed while catching up on their families and all the locals they knew, getting to know each other in general. Although she knew this friendship would probably fade and disappear by the time the puppies were adopted, and even though traipsing out to that bar every day was wearing her out, she was enjoying his company more than she could admit even to herself.</p><p>\u201cDid you always plan to come back here? To take over your father\u2019s practice?\u201d Annie asked him one evening.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he said. \u201cWasn\u2019t part of my plan at all. First of all, I prefer Thoroughbreds to cows. I wanted to treat them, breed them, show them, race them. I did a couple of years\u2019 residency in equine orthopedics, worked in a big practice in Kentucky, then in a real lucrative practice outside Los Angeles. Then my dad wanted to retire. He\u2019d put in his time\u2014he\u2019s seventy-five now. Years back, he and my mom bought a horse property in a nice section of southern Arizona, but they wanted to keep the house and stable, not to mention the vet practice, in the family. You have any idea how hard it is to build a practice with these tough old farmers and ranchers?\u201d He chuckled. \u201cThe name Nathaniel Jensen goes a long way around here, even though I am the upstart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo here you are.....back at the family practice?\u201d she asked. But she was thinking that he\u2019d been rubbing elbows with big-money horse people. Society people, whom she\u2019d seen at a distance at certain competitions and fairs, but knew none of. She\u2019d been riding since she could walk, took lessons and competed in dressage, and so was more than a little familiar with the kind of wealth associated with breeding, racing and showing Thoroughbreds. The well-to-do could send their daughters to Europe for lessons, fly their horses to Churchill Downs in private planes and invest millions in their horse farms. Humboldt County farm girls couldn\u2019t compete with that. She swallowed, feeling not a little out of her league.</p> <p>\u201cI said I\u2019d give it a chance. My plan was to put in a year or two, save some money, maybe break in a new guy with an interest in the stable and practice. But I haven\u2019t gotten around to that and it\u2019s been two years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re still planning to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to tell you what\u2019s great about this place.\u201d He smiled. \u201cAnd I think I don\u2019t have to tell you what\u2019s missing. It\u2019s kind of a quiet life for a bachelor. Remember that dull social life you mentioned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I forget?\u201d she threw back at him.</p><p>\u201cYou seeing someone?\u201d he asked suddenly, surprising her.</p> <p>\u201cHmm? No. No, not at the moment. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Date much?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Startled, she just shook her head. \u201cNot much. Now and then.\u201d She thought for a moment and then said, \u201cAh. The vacation. Getting away to see if you can jump-start your social life a little bit?\u201d</p><p>He just smiled. \u201cCouldn\u2019t hurt. And it\u2019ll be nice to catch up with friends. We were real tight in vet school. We got each other through a lot of exams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many of you are going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFive men, including me, two of them married and bringing wives. Two women vets.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWomen vets? Married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne\u2019s still single and one\u2019s divorced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha,\u201d she said. \u201cI bet one\u2019s an old girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCome on\u2014didn\u2019t you ever date one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I dated both of them. Briefly. We worked out better as study partners than.....well, than anything else.\u201d He took a drink. \u201cReally, I want to fish.\u201d</p><p>She took a last bite of her dinner. \u201cFishing is real good around here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI fish the rivers here. A little deep-sea fishing sounded like a good idea. Some sun would be acceptable. I have golf clubs,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cI used to play a lot of golf in L.A. Yeah,\u201d he mused, \u201ca little sunshine won\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p> <p>After a moment she reminded him with a smile, \u201cAnd soon you\u2019ll be lying on a beach in the middle of a hundred string bikinis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cMaybe I should do more fishing around here if I want to catch the big one.\u201d</p><p>By the time Sunday rolled around, Annie was back at the farm. She went early in the day so she could drop by the bar later that afternoon. Today, so close to Christmas, she was baking with her mother all day\u2014breads, pastries, cookies to be frozen for the barrage of company\u2014but she would have her dinner at the bar. Because of the puppies, of course.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very quiet, Annie,\u201d her mother said. \u201cI think you\u2019re letting this adventure with the puppies wear you out. You\u2019ve always had such a tender heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am tired,\u201d she admitted, rolling out cookie dough. \u201cI\u2019m getting up extra early, starting at the shop earlier so I can leave earlier, staying up late to finish work. And you know I won\u2019t leave my house alone\u2014I\u2019m decorating for Christmas. I\u2019ve been doing a little here and there, before and after work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t be out here two days a week,\u201d Rose McKenzie said. \u201cReally, I appreciate the help, but I\u2019m not too old to do the holiday baking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI count on our baking as gifts,\u201d Annie said. \u201cSo I\u2019m glad to help.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize we had a new and improved Doc Jensen,\u201d she went on, changing the subject. \u201cI thought it was still old Doc Jensen who came for the horses and Erasmus when you needed a vet. But when he stopped to look at the puppies, he explained he was Nathaniel Junior. You never mentioned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure we did, honey. His coming home was good gossip there for a while. He had some woman living with him, but she took off like a scalded cat. I don\u2019t think we talked about anything else for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman? When was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple years ago. Some fancy young Hollywood girl,\u201d Rose said with an indulgent laugh. \u201cWe ran into them a few times\u2014at the fair, the farmers\u2019 market, here and there.\u201d Her mother was kneading dough as she chattered. \u201cYou know, you don\u2019t run into people that often around here. They could\u2019ve been here a year before anyone met her, but Nathaniel had her out and about. Probably trying to help her get acquainted. But it didn\u2019t work too well, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I would have remembered, Mom. I don\u2019t think you ever mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>Rose looked skyward briefly, trying to remember. \u201cThat might\u2019ve been about the time you were preoccupied with other things. Like buying the Clip and Curl shop. And then there was Ed, and that ordeal with Ed. You might\u2019ve had other things on your mind.\u201d</p><p>Ed. Yes, Ed. She hadn\u2019t exactly been engaged, thank God, but they\u2019d been an item for about a year and she\u2019d expected to be engaged. They had talked about marriage. She laughed humorlessly. \u201cThat could have distracted me a little,\u201d Annie agreed.</p><p>\u201cThe bum,\u201d Rose McKenzie muttered, punching dough more aggressively than necessary. \u201cHe\u2019s a pig and a fool and a liar and a.....a bum!\u201d</p><p>Loving it, Annie laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s really not a bum. He works hard and earns a good living, which it turned out he needed for all the women he had on a string. But I concede to pig, liar and fool, and I\u2019m certainly not missing him. The louse,\u201d she added. \u201cI can\u2019t remember now\u2014why was it we didn\u2019t let the boys shoot him in the head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember exactly, either,\u201d Rose said. \u201cI knew all along he wasn\u2019t right for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t,\u201d Annie argued. \u201cYou had me trying on your wedding dress about once a month, asking me constantly if we\u2019d talked about a date. You expected him to give me a ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just thought if.....\u201d</p><p>Ed was in farm-equipment sales and had a very broad territory in northern California, a job that had him on the road most of the week. Then she learned that for the entire time they\u2019d dated, Ed was involved with another woman in Arcata. About six months ago he\u2019d decided it was time to make a choice, and he chose the other woman.</p><p>Ouch.</p><p>Annie\u2019s pride was hurt, but worse than hurt pride was her embarrassment. How had this been going on without her getting so much as a whiff of it? When she hadn\u2019t seen him, she had talked to him every single day. He never betrayed the slightest hint that she was not the only female in his life. And it made her furious to think he\u2019d been with another woman while he was with her. She even drove to Arcata to sneak a look at her, but she couldn\u2019t figure out, based on looks, just what it was that won her the great prize that was Ed.</p><p>Before she could ponder that for long, that Arcata woman found her, looked her up, informed her they weren\u2019t the only two. Ed, as it happened, was quite the dabbler. He had at least one other steady girlfriend to spend the nights with.</p><p>Her tears had turned to fumes. She threw out everything that reminded her of him. She bought all new bedding and towels. Went to the doctor and got a clean bill of health. But at the end of the day when she grieved, it wasn\u2019t so much for Ed as for the idea of Ed; she had invested a year in a man she thought would give her the stability of marriage and family, a settled life. The dependence of love. Security. When she thought about Ed, she wanted to dismember him. She wanted her brothers to go after him and beat him senseless. But not only would she never take him back, she\u2019d cross the street to avoid him. So maybe Rose was right\u2014maybe they both really knew all along he just wasn\u2019t the one.</p><p>But neither was anyone else. She hadn\u2019t been out on five dates since the breakup a little more than six months ago, and the number of boyfriends she\u2019d had before Ed had come along were too few to count. She went out with her girlfriends regularly, but the best part of her life was spending a couple of days on the farm, riding, cooking or baking or putting up preserves with her mom.</p><p>The farmhouse had a wide porch that stretched the length of the house, and from that porch you could watch the seasons come and go. The brightness of spring, the lushness of summer, the burnt color of fall, the white of winter. She watched the year pass from that porch, as she had since she was a little girl. But lately it seemed as though the years were passing way too quickly and she wondered if she\u2019d ever find the right partner to sit there with rather than alone.</p><p>A Hollywood woman? A fancy Hollywood woman? That would explain things like Caribbean vacations. Nate was drawn to flashy, sexy women. Or maybe the kind of women found in the private boxes at races or horse shows; Annie had seen enough of those televised events to know the type\u2014model gorgeous, decked out in designer clothes, hand-stitched boots, lots of fringe and bling. Or the type seen at the fund-raisers and society events attended by the wives, daughters and sisters of Thoroughbred breeders, the kind of women whose horses were entered in the Preakness. Or perhaps he preferred medically educated women, like another vet who could appreciate his professional interests\u2014the kind of women who also rubbed elbows with the well-to-do because of their profession. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But probably ordinary, sensible-shoes farm girls didn\u2019t do anything special for a man like Nate.</p><p>Annie\u2019s thoughts were broken when her father walked into the kitchen and refilled his coffee cup. He put a hand on the small of his back and stretched, leaning back, rolling his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cAre you limping, Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d he said. \u201cGot a little hitch in my giddy-up is all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs soon as I\u2019m through with this puppy project, I\u2019ll make it a point to get out here more often to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctor says the best thing is for him to keep moving,\u201d Rose said. \u201cYou do enough to help already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember that fancy Hollywood woman?\u201d Hank asked, going back to the conversation he had overheard. Without waiting for an answer, he added, \u201cBreeze woulda blown her away. Skinny thing. Could see her bones. Not at all right for Nathaniel.\u201d He took a sip of coffee and lifted his bushy brows, looking at her over the rim of his mug. \u201cYou\u2019da been more his speed, I think. Yeah, better Nathaniel than that son of a so-and-so you got yourself mixed up with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know Nate Jensen was here until a few days ago, remember?\u201d Annie pointed out. \u201cAnd before that, I was with the so-and-so, and Nate was taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019da had to kill that skinny thing, but she looked near death, anyhow.\u201d Then he grinned at her and left the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cWill Nathaniel have his family for Christmas?\u201d Rose asked.</p><p>\u201cActually, he said his parents, sisters and their families are going on a cruise. I gathered, from the way he said it, he\u2019d throw himself off the boat if he were along. He said something sarcastic, like it would be hell to give up all that shuffleboard, but he\u2019d manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you must invite him to join us for the holiday dinners, Annie. As I recall, he was friendly with one of your brothers when they were kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, he\u2019s not hanging around. He\u2019s going on some highfalutin Caribbean vacation, meeting up with some old classmates from veterinary college, hoping to get lost in a sea of very tiny bikinis on the beach. Apparently his taste in women hasn\u2019t changed much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Rose asked. \u201cNow to me, that sounds dull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you\u2019re a single guy in your thirties, Mom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. Well, then take him some of these cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he couldn\u2019t care less about home-baked cookies.\u201d Not if what he prefers is some fancy, skinny, rich girl, she thought.</p><p>\u201cNonsense. I don\u2019t know the man who doesn\u2019t like home-baked cookies. Reminds them of their mothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the image I\u2019d most like to aspire to,\u201d Annie said.</p><p>Three</p><p>Rose McKenzie insisted that Annie take a plate of Christmas cookies to Dr. Jensen, but it made Annie feel silly, farm girlish, so she left them in the car when she went into Jack\u2019s bar later that afternoon.</p><p>She gasped in pleasure when she walked in\u2014the place had been decorated for Christmas. A tree stood in the corner opposite the hearth, garlands were strung along the bar and walls, small evergreen centerpieces sat on the tables, and the buck over the door wore a wreath on his antlers. It was festive and homey, and the fresh pine scent mingled with wood smoke and good cooking from the kitchen to complete the holiday mood.</p><p>It took her less than two seconds to see that Nate wasn\u2019t there, which made her doubly glad she hadn\u2019t trotted in her plate of baked goods. Maybe this was the day he wasn\u2019t going to show. It wasn\u2019t as though he had any obligation here. In fact, besides giving the puppies a cursory look and asking Annie if there was anything wrong with any of them, he didn\u2019t do anything at all.</p> <p>She gave Jack a wave and went directly to the puppies, which, in the past week, had gotten surprisingly big. Boy, if those weren\u2019t all border collies, she was no judge of canines. Out of the eight, two were solid black with maybe a little silver or gray or perhaps a mere touch of white\u2014the only indication another breed might\u2019ve been involved. But they had grown so much! And they were doing so beautifully\u2014plump and fluffy and adorable. Just like everyone else who passed by that box, she couldn\u2019t resist immediately picking a puppy up and cuddling it against her chin.</p><p>Jack came over to the hearth and she grinned at him. \u201cThe bar looks wonderful, Jack. All ready for Santa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, the women got it ready for their hen party. Cookie exchange tomorrow at noon\u2014you should come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNuts, I\u2019ll be at work. But tell them the decorations are beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cAnnie, we\u2019ve got a situation. We\u2019re going to have to come up with another plan here.\u201d</p><p>Instinctively she picked up Comet to judge his size and strength; he wriggled nicely. \u201cWhy\u2019s that, Jack?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He was shaking his head. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work much longer. I can go another day, two at the most, while you figure something out, but the puppies have to find a new home. They\u2019re getting bigger, more energetic, and giving off the kind of odor reminiscent of a box full of puppy shit. This is an eating-and-drinking establishment, Annie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre people complaining?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cJust the opposite,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cWe\u2019re drawing a nice crowd on account of the big tree and the cute little puppies. But you know puppies, Annie. They\u2019re wetting on a lot of laps while they\u2019re being held and snuggled. This is going to go from cute and fun to a big problem real soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, helpless. \u201cOh.\u201d Well, it wasn\u2019t as though she had trouble understanding. It was different when the litter was in your downstairs bathroom or under the laundry sink in a home, or when there was a mother dog around tending the nursery. You just didn\u2019t realize how hard that mother dog worked unless you had to care for the puppies yourself. Even when there were eight of them, as long as they were nursing, good old Mom licked them from head to toe, keeping them clean and dry. The second you started giving them solid food, Mom stopped cleaning up after them and it took no time at all for them to get a little stinky and messy. But under normal circumstances, that came at about six weeks, right about the time they were ready to leave the nursery anyway.</p><p>In this case, there\u2019d been no mom, and the formula and cereal that went in one end came out the other. Their bedding couldn\u2019t be changed fast enough or their cute little bottoms washed often enough to avoid a smell.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d she asked herself.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got homes for some of them figured out,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure any of them are ready to be out of the box yet, but we\u2019ve got a few adoptions worked out. There\u2019s Christopher, of course. He\u2019s not letting Comet get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComet\u2019s not ready to be the responsibility of a six-year-old. He needs a couple more weeks. And good as Chris is with him, he\u2019ll have to be supervised,\u201d Annie said.</p><p>\u201cI know. And I\u2019m sunk,\u201d Jack said. \u201cDavid keeps babbling about his \u2018boppie.\u2019 I\u2019ve been thinking about getting a dog, anyway, something to clean up the spills around my place. But.....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, Jack, you can\u2019t turn a puppy this size over to a three-year-old boy any more than you can put him in charge of eggs and ripe tomatoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, when it\u2019s time, we\u2019ll be careful. And Buck Anderson, sheep rancher, says it\u2019s about time to get a couple of new herders ready. He\u2019s got a little child of his own and seven grandchildren. He can speak for two\u2014his sons can help get \u2019em grown before they turn them over to the other dogs and the sheep. He\u2019d like them to be Christmas dogs, though. Now, I know you don\u2019t trust people looking for puppies as Christmas gifts, but you can count on Buck. He knows the score.\u201d Jack took a breath. \u201cI don\u2019t like their chances if they won\u2019t herd sheep, however.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s four taken care of,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cCouple of other people have been thinking about it, but that\u2019s the progress so far. Did you realize everyone in town has named them after the reindeer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, cute, huh? Jack, I don\u2019t have a place for them. I guess I could take them to my house and run home between haircuts to make sure they\u2019re fed and watered, but to tell the truth, I don\u2019t have that kind of time. At Christmastime, everyone wants to be beautiful. And I try to spend as much time at the farm as I can\u2014the whole family\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we need to rethink that shelter idea. Couldn\u2019t they just look after them for a couple of weeks? Then we\u2019ll take at least a few off their hands......\u201d</p><p>Just then Nathaniel blew in with a gust of wind. He pulled off his gloves and slapped them in his palm. He looked around the recently decorated bar and whistled approvingly. \u201cHey,\u201d he said to Annie and Jack. \u201cHow\u2019s everything?\u201d Silence answered him. \u201cSomething wrong?\u201d</p><p>Annie stepped toward him. \u201cJack can\u2019t keep the puppies here anymore, Nate. They\u2019re starting to smell like dogs. It is a restaurant, after all.\u201d</p><p>Nate laughed. \u201cI think you\u2019ve hung in there pretty well, Jack. Lasted longer than I predicted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Nate. If Annie hadn\u2019t been so convincing, these guys would have gone to a shelter right off the bat. Or someplace way worse. At least we\u2019ve figured out homes for a few\u2014when they\u2019re old enough and strong enough to leave the litter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I understand,\u201d Nate said good-naturedly. \u201cWell, if Annie promises not to bail on me, I\u2019ll take \u2019em home. I\u2019m pretty busy most days, but I have a vet tech at the clinic to help. And they don\u2019t need quite as much hands-on care as they did a week ago\u2014at least they can all lap up their meals without an eyedropper now. I can put \u2019em in the laundry room and close the door so they don\u2019t keep me up all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill they be warm enough?\u201d Annie asked. \u201cAre they strong enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be fine, Annie. Jack\u2014what\u2019s for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChili. Corn bread. Really? You\u2019ll take them out of here?\u201d</p><p>Nate laughed. \u201cCan we mooch one more meal before we cart them away? I\u2019m a bachelor\u2014there\u2019s hardly ever any food in the house.\u201d He draped an arm around Annie\u2019s shoulders. \u201cThis one is spoiled now\u2014she\u2019s used to getting fed for her efforts. And two beers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jack said, lifting a curious eyebrow. \u201cComing right up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter we eat, you can follow me home,\u201d he said to Annie, as if the matter was settled.</p><p>Annie knew approximately where the Jensen clinic, stable and house were, but she couldn\u2019t remember ever going there. You might take your poodle or spaniel to the small-animal vet, but the large-animal vet came to you, unless you had a big animal in need of surgery or with some condition that required long-term and frequent care. His stable also provided occasional short-term boarding for horses. And he had breeding facilities, but that also was most often done at the farm or ranch by the farmers and ranchers. Some owners of very valuable horses preferred to leave their prefoaling mares with the vet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nate transported the puppy box in the covered bed of his truck. They were bundled up with extra blankets and wouldn\u2019t get too cold on the short ride. Annie followed in her own truck. They made a left off the main road at the sign that said Jensen Stables, Dr. Nathaniel Jensen, DVM. The road was paved, which was high cotton in this part of the world. It was tree-lined and the snow-covered brush was cut back from the edge. The road had to be at least half a mile long. Then it opened into a well-lit compound. The stable was on the left of a large open area, with a corral surrounding it on the side and back. The clinic itself was attached to the stable. There were Christmas lights twinkling in one of the windows. On the right was a sprawling, modern one-story house with a brick sidewalk that led up to double front doors of dark wood set with beveled-glass windows. Not a single Christmas light or ornament on the house at all. Annie wondered if the vet tech had decorated the clinic.</p><p>Between the house and stable were two horse trailers. One could hold six horses, the other two, and both were so fancy they probably came with a bar and cabin attendants.</p><p>The garage door at one end of the house opened automatically, and Nate pulled in. Annie parked outside and walked through the garage. She carried the formula and baby cereal while he carried the box, managing to open the door into the house and flick on lights with his elbow as he walked through the kitchen and then disappeared. The kitchen was the kind Annie\u2019s mother would have died for\u2014large new appliances, six-burner stove, double oven, work island with a sink. It was gorgeous. It looked newly remodeled.</p><p>Annie moved more slowly, peering past a long breakfast bar into a spacious family room with big, comfy-looking furniture and a beautiful fireplace. On each side of the fireplace were floor-to-ceiling bookcases filled with leather-bound volumes.</p> <p>\u201cAnnie? Where are you?\u201d</p><p>She stopped gawking and followed the voice. She passed a very long, old oak table in a large breakfast nook inside bay windows that looked out on the back of the property. A sharp left and down a short hall took her past a bathroom, a bedroom and into a laundry room. In addition to cabinets, there was a stainless-steel washer and dryer, along with a deep sink. This was not an old farmhouse, that was for sure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll use linens from the clinic to line their box,\u201d Nate said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be fine in here. Listen, I know you signed on for this duty, but I don\u2019t want you to feel like you have to rearrange your schedule to get out here the first minute you can escape work every day. Virginia, my tech, can help during the day and I get called out sometimes, but this time of year, no one\u2019s breeding or birthing, so it\u2019s not usually too hectic. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cI won\u2019t come. I\u2019ll leave a number. If you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, could you still come sometimes?\u201d he asked with a laugh. \u201cIf you give me a hand feeding and cleaning up, I\u2019ll thaw a hunk of meat to throw in the broiler or something. Nothing like Preacher\u2019s, but edible. Just let me know when you can be here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have your tech......\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to ask Virginia to stay after five unless we have special patients\u2014she wants to get home, have dinner with her husband. I\u2019ll fix you up with a key, in case I\u2019m tied up on a case and you beat me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Tell me exactly what you want,\u201d she said.</p><p>He put his hands on his hips. \u201cI want to know what\u2019s wrong. Why are you frowning like that? You\u2019ve been frowning since I walked into Jack\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Mentally, she tried to smooth out her eyebrows, but she could still feel the wrinkle. She\u2019d been trying to picture him with a trophy girl on his arm, that was what. Or with an equestrienne from a high-muck-a-muck ranch who raced or showed horses all over the world. Or maybe a mature and attractive woman his age who was as smart and successful as he was. And he was so damn handsome it wasn\u2019t hard to imagine all this. But she said, \u201cYou\u2019re downright chipper. This is exactly what you didn\u2019t want, but you\u2019re almost thrilled about having the puppies here. What\u2019s up with that?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNah. I knew it was going to come to this. I\u2019m glad Jack and Preacher handled them for that first week for two reasons\u2014they had to be fed, dried and checked frequently, and I enjoyed stopping by the bar on the way home every day. Don\u2019t know when I\u2019ve eaten so well,\u201d he added, rubbing a flat belly. \u201cNow that it\u2019s apparent they\u2019re all going to make it, they only have to be checked and fed every few hours, something Virginia and I can handle during the day. I agree with you about the shelter. They\u2019d probably be just fine\u2014those folks are devoted, and they interview and screen efficiently before they let a tiny, orphaned animal out of there. But why take chances? If we have to use the shelter, we\u2019ll just do so after Christmas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? You knew all along you\u2019d get stuck with them?\u201d</p><p>He just laughed. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll show you the house I grew up in, we\u2019ll put on some coffee, feed the pups and put \u2019em down for the night. How about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to show me the house. I\u2019m not going to be poking around in here.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her hand. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about you poking around. Come on,\u201d he said again, pulling her back through the kitchen. He took her through a spacious great room, where he said, \u201cMany fights between my sisters happened here. When I grew up, there was old, floral, ratty furniture in here, but once everyone got educated and off Mom and Dad\u2019s payroll, new things began to appear around the house. Things got updated and remodeled.\u201d He pulled her down the hall, showed her where the master bedroom and three others were located. \u201cI got the bed-and-bath on the other side of the kitchen. Kept me away from the girls.\u201d Then he took a right turn off the great room. \u201cFormal living room, used only on family holidays like Christmas, and dining room, used for overflow at big family dinners.\u201d And then they were back in the huge kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s enormous,\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cIt\u2019s very beautiful. What must it have been like to grow up in a house so large?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI probably took it for granted, like any kid would,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s still my parents\u2019 house, though I doubt they\u2019ll ever move back here. Come on, I\u2019ll put on coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to entertain me, Nate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m entertaining myself. I don\u2019t have much company out here.\u201d</p> <p>The moment they had the coffee poured Annie remembered. \u201cDamn,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t move. I have something for you.\u201d She dashed out the garage door to her car, retrieved the cookies and brought them in. In typical country fashion, they were arranged on a clear, plastic plate with plastic wrap covering them. \u201cFor you,\u201d she said. \u201cThey should be warm, but now they\u2019re nearly frozen. My mother insisted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe baked them for me?\u201d he asked, surprised, as he peeled off the wrap and helped himself.</p><p>\u201cWell, kind of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe baked together today. All day. We do that for the holidays. Stuff for the freezer, gifts for neighbors and for my girls at the shop. We bake on my days off for weeks right up to Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bake?\u201d he asked, looking mesmerized, maybe shocked.</p><p>She smirked. \u201cAll farm girls bake. I also know how to quilt, garden, put up preserves and chop the head off a chicken. I couldn\u2019t butcher a cow by myself, but I know how it\u2019s done and I\u2019ve helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>She was not flattered by his response. She\u2019d hardly led a glamorous life and she\u2019d much rather have told him she\u2019d gone to boarding school in Switzerland and dressage training in England. \u201cI bet I remind you of your mother, huh?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNot exactly. Do you fish? Hunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been fishing and hunting, but I prefer the farm. Well, I shot a mountain lion once, but that was a long time ago and I wasn\u2019t hunting. The little bastard was after my mother\u2019s chickens, and the boys had already moved away, so I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old were you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014thirteen or fourteen. But I\u2019m not crazy about hunting. I like to ride. I miss the cows. I loved the calving. Ice cream made from fresh cream. Warm eggs, right out from under the chicken. I have more 4-H ribbons than anyone in my family. Erasmus, that mean old bull? He\u2019s mine. Blue ribbon\u2014state fair. I was fifteen when he came along\u2014he\u2019s an old guy now, and the father of hundreds. I have a green thumb like my mother\u2014I can stick anything in the ground and it grows. I once grew a rock bush.\u201d He threw her a shocked expression and she rolled her eyes. He recovered. \u201cJust one of those plain old farm girls. Size-ten boot and taller than all the boys till I was a senior in high school. My dad calls me solid. Steady. Not the kind of girl men are drawn to. I attract.....puppies. That\u2019s what.\u201d</p><p>He smiled hugely, showing her his bright white teeth and that maddening dimple. \u201cIs that a fact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your type, certainly. I\u2019ve never had a string bikini. I wouldn\u2019t know what to do with one. Floss your teeth? Is that what you do?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThere are sexier things than string bikinis,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe minute I heard you describe being lost in the middle of a hundred string bikinis, I got a picture in my mind that I haven\u2019t been able to get rid of. It\u2019s like having a bad song stuck in your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus, don\u2019t you just have a giant bug up your ass,\u201d he said, amused.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what you mean,\u201d she said, though she knew exactly. She was a terrible liar. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know you weren\u2019t your father, you know. I had no idea you were the vet until you showed up at Jack\u2019s. And today while we were baking, my folks told me that when you came up here to take over the practice, they\u2019d talked about nothing else for months. I guess you brought your girlfriend with you. A beautiful, fancy, Hollywood woman.\u201d</p><p>Shock widened his mouth and eyes. \u201cGet outta here,\u201d he said. Then he erupted into laughter. \u201cIs that what they\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><p>A little embarrassed, she shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know that anyone\u2019s saying anything anymore, and I don\u2019t know who besides my folks saw it that way.\u201d</p><p>He laughed for a long time, finally getting himself under control. \u201cOkay, look. She was my fianc\u00e9e, okay? But it was my mistake, bringing her up here, because she was far too young. I must have been out of my mind. She wasn\u2019t ready to get married. Thank God. And she wasn\u2019t a Hollywood woman, although she really wanted to be. Maybe she is by now, for all I know. Susanna was from Van Nuys. The only thing she knew about horses was that they have four legs and big teeth. She was twenty-four to my twenty-nine, had never lived in a small town and really didn\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd thin,\u201d Annie added. \u201cVery thin.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He put his hands in his pockets, rocked back on his heels, lifted expressive dark brows and with a grin he said, \u201cWell, not all over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s disgusting,\u201d she returned, disapproval sounding loud.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not nice to talk meanly about past girlfriends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet she looked great in a string bikini,\u201d Annie said with a snort.</p> <p>\u201cJust unbelievable,\u201d he said, clearly taunting her. \u201cNow, why would you be so jealous? You don\u2019t even know poor, thin Susanna. For all you know, she\u2019s a sweet, caring, genuine person and I was horrible to her.\u201d And he said all this with a sly smile.</p><p>\u201cI am certainly not jealous! Curious, but not jealous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreen as a bullfrog,\u201d he accused.</p><p>\u201cOh, bloody hell. Listen, I\u2019m shot. Long day. Gotta go.\u201d She grabbed her purse and jacket and whirled out of the kitchen. And got lost. She found herself in the wide hall that led to the bedrooms. She found her way back to the great room, then to the kitchen. \u201cWhere the hell is the door?\u201d</p><p>He swept an arm wide toward the door that led to the garage, still wearing that superior smile. What an egomaniac, she thought, heading for the door.</p> <p>When she got to her car, she thought, well, that was perfectly awful. What\u2019s more, he saw right through her. She was attracted to him, and because she knew there had probably been many beautiful women in his past, she\u2019d let it goad her into some grotesque and envious remarks about the only one she knew of, Susanna. The child-woman who obviously had a little butt and nice rack. Why in the world would she do that? What did she care?</p><p>It probably had something to do with touring a four-thousand-square-foot custom home, beautifully furnished, across the compound from a spacious stable with a couple of horse trailers her dad would have killed for. Well, what was one to expect from a veterinary practice that served so many, over such a wide area? And not a new practice, either, but a mature one\u2014probably forty years old. Established. Lucrative.</p><p>She\u2019d grown up in a three-bedroom, hundred-year-old farmhouse. Her three brothers shared a bedroom and never let her forget it for a second. They all shared one very small bathroom. But she loved the way she\u2019d grown up and had never been jealous a day in her life\u2014why would she be now? Could it be that in addition to all that, she\u2019d never gone to special, private schools, never worn custom-tailored riding gear, never could afford the best riding lessons or most prestigious competitions? Also, she had wide hips, big feet and a less-than-memorable bustline. \u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake, Annie,\u201d she said to herself. \u201cSince when have you even thought about those things!\u201d</p><p>How long had she been sitting here in her car? Long enough to get cold, that was how long. Well, it was time to suck it up. She\u2019d go back in there and just tell him she was cranky, that being one of those \u201csturdy\u201d farm girls who owns exactly one pair of high heels she can barely walk in, it just rubbed her the wrong way hearing about the kind of woman who could get the attention of one of the county\u2019s few bachelors. Not that she wanted his attention, but just the same.....She\u2019d apologize and promise never to act that way again. She wasn\u2019t usually emotional. Or irrational.</p><p>She walked back into the still-open garage, up to the back door and gave a short tap. It flew open. He reached out and grabbed her wrist, pulled her roughly into the house, put his arms around her, pressed her up against the kitchen wall just inside the door, and kissed her! His mouth came down on hers so fiercely, with such dominance and confidence, her eyes flew open in shock. Then he began to move over her mouth while he held her against the wall with his wide, hard chest, his big hands running up and down her rib cage, over her hips.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t move. She couldn\u2019t raise her arms or let her eyes drift closed or even kiss back. She held her breath. What the hell.....?</p> <p>He finally lifted his lips off hers and said, \u201cYou like me. I knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like you that much. Never do that again,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou want me,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to let you have me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re conceited. I do not want you.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, and again her eyes flew open. This time she worked her arms free and pushed against his chest.</p><p>\u201cWell, hell, just kiss me back and see if I start to grow on you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo. Because you think this is funny. I came back in here to apologize for being crabby. I don\u2019t care about that skinny woman. Girl. I\u2019m just a little tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize, Annie. I think it\u2019s kind of cute. But you don\u2019t have to be jealous of Susanna. She\u2019s long gone and I hardly even missed her. We weren\u2019t right for each other. At all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what my dad said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHank said that?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say? Exactly?\u201d Nate wanted to know.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t. But she did. \u201cHe said I\u2019d be more your type, but I\u2019d have had to kill the skinny blonde first. He said she looked near death, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Nate thought that was hilarious. He laughed for a long time, but he didn\u2019t let go of her. \u201cGood thing she left, then. She couldn\u2019t hold her own in any kind of fight. She cried if she broke a nail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet she was just one of many.\u201d</p><p>He withdrew a little, but the amusement stayed in his eyes. \u201cYou think I\u2019m a player.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you not be? It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t know about those rich horse people. And you\u2019re the doctor! Of course you\u2019ve had a million girlfriends.\u201d</p><p>The smile finally vanished. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not that guy, Annie. Just \u2019cause I\u2019ve been around those folks doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m that kind of guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there are the girl vets you\u2019re going to the islands with,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cTina and Cindy,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cShew. I hate to brag, but I\u2019m thirty-two, Annie, and there have been a couple of women in my past. But I bet there are a couple of guys in yours, too. Tina and Cindy are just friends of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. I\u2019m sure. Old friends and a hundred string bikinis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome back in and finish your coffee,\u201d he said with a tolerant chuckle.</p><p>\u201cI have to go. I have to get home to Ahab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Nate asked.</p><p>\u201cMy cat. Ahab. Tripod. He has a lot of names. He\u2019s three-legged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Nate asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I adopted him from the shelter when it was clear no one else would ever take him. He\u2019s got a bad attitude, but he loves me. He\u2019s very independent, but he does like to eat. I have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you coming back tomorrow after work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be a gentleman?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He lifted one of those handsome brows. \u201cYou want me to?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cAbsolutely. Or I\u2019m leaving the puppies all to you without helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust come tomorrow after work. Swing by home and feed your cat first so you don\u2019t have to be in a hurry to leave.\u201d He gave her a very polite kiss on the cheek that just oozed with suggestiveness. \u201cI\u2019ll see you then.\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>Christmastime in a beauty shop was always frantic and the Clip and Curl was no exception. There were less than two weeks till Christmas and Annie\u2019s clientele, the clientele of the whole shop, wanted to look their best for parties, open houses, family visits, neighborhood gatherings. Appointments were one after the other. There was a lot of gossip, a lot of excited chatter. Annie was pretty quiet the next day, but there was plenty of talk in the place to cover the void.</p><p>Pam, who was older than Annie by a few years and had been married for ten, was training to be the assistant manager. While Annie was applying foil to strips of hair for highlighting, Pam approached with the appointment book in her hands. \u201cWe have three choices. We can turn away some of our best regular customers, stay open till nine a couple of nights or open up the next two Mondays to fit them in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t people schedule ahead of time?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>\u201cAs you taught me, they expect to be accommodated and we can either do that or lose them to another shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStaying late is hard for me and you have a family. I don\u2019t want to stick you with that duty,\u201d Annie said. Then after thinking about it, she said, \u201cMaybe I should work nights. That would settle that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSettle what?\u201d Pam asked, holding the large appointment book in her crossed arms, against her chest.</p><p>\u201cOh, that guy. The vet. You know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy at the bar, Jack, he said they couldn\u2019t keep the litter of puppies there anymore. The dogs are doing very well, growing, which means they\u2019ll soon be up to their eyeballs in puppy poop. Not a real appetizing prospect for a restaurant. So Jack said that\u2019s it, they have to go. Dr. Jensen took them to his house, which is part of the whole stable-and-vet-clinic operation. And since I made a commitment to help.....he\u2019s counting on me coming over after work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo his house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He said if I\u2019d help, he\u2019d thaw something for us to eat. We\u2019ve been having a beer and dinner at that bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, it\u2019s up to you, Annie. It\u2019s your shop. My husband\u2019s on board to get the kids from school and take care of their dinner and homework. You know I need whatever hours.....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you make the decision,\u201d Annie said.</p><p>Pam lowered the appointment book and held it against her thigh. \u201cAnnie, I don\u2019t need you to stay if the shop is open till nine or open Mondays for a couple of weeks. Two of the girls are willing to work a little extra to help pay for Christmas. But you have to feel comfortable about leaving me in charge. And I don\u2019t want to push you to do that before you\u2019re ready. You\u2019ve run a pretty tight, one-woman show here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I?\u201d</p><p>Pam nodded. \u201cBut I don\u2019t blame you, Annie. This is your shop, your investment, your responsibility. Whenever you think I\u2019m ready, I\u2019m glad to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThing is, he kissed me.\u201d</p><p>It became very quiet in the shop. Pam\u2019s mouth dropped open.</p><p>\u201cNuts,\u201d Annie said. There were no ears gifted with supersonic hearing like those found in a beauty shop, despite the noise of dryers and running water. She looked around the small shop. It was tiny\u2014three chairs on each side of the room. Two dryers and two deep sinks in back. Behind that was their break room and Annie\u2019s little office.</p><p>In the salon now were women in various stages of beautifying, rods, rollers, foils or backcombed tresses blooming from their heads. Beauticians with blow-dryers, curling irons, combs and brushes in their hands, poised over those heads. All silent. All waiting. \u201cTalk among yourselves,\u201d Annie instructed.</p><p>\u201cLotsa luck,\u201d Pam said. \u201cIs this guy, this vet, in any way appealing?\u201d</p><p>Annie\u2019s cheeks got a little rosy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs he cute?\u201d Pam asked.</p><p>Annie leaned toward Pam and whispered, \u201cYou\u2019d wet yourself.\u201d</p><p>And Pam\u2019s cheeks got a little pink. \u201cWhew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, tell us about him,\u201d someone said.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, what kind of guy is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould you call the police or wear something with a real low neckline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is he? How many times has he been married? Because that\u2019s key. Believe me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I can\u2019t talk about this,\u201d Annie said. \u201cI\u2019ve known the man barely a week! And only because of these puppies! Honestly, if it weren\u2019t for these puppies, we wouldn\u2019t even know about each other. He\u2019s a large-animal vet. He was just doing the bartender, Jack, a favor by looking at the orphaned litter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, Annie, don\u2019t you have large animals? Who\u2019s your vet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, he is, but I didn\u2019t know that. I mean, my folks keep an eye on the horses and Erasmus. My bull,\u201d she clarified for those confused stares in the room. \u201cWhen they said they called Doc Jensen to the farm, I thanked them and paid the bill. I mean, it hardly ever happens that the horses or the bull needs something. I thought he was the same Doc Jensen who\u2019d been looking after our animals since I was in diapers. But it turned out to be his son. Doc Jensen Junior.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cHe\u2019s thirty-two. And never been married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d someone said. Another woman whistled.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s had girlfriends,\u201d Annie said. \u201cNot from around here. But when he came up here to take over his dad\u2019s practice a couple of years ago, he brought a young buxom blond fianc\u00e9e with him and it didn\u2019t work out, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLow neckline,\u201d someone advised.</p><p>\u201cTight jeans. Snug, anyway. I mean this in the nicest way, but if you could think about a little extra makeup, like eyeliner and lip liner,\u201d someone said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need that,\u201d Pam said quietly.</p> <p>\u201cI was thinking that maybe being unavailable would be a good\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d three women said at once.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d Pam asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just too damn sure of himself,\u201d Annie answered.</p><p>\u201cWell, how about this,\u201d Pam said. \u201cMaybe you could try being sure of yourself?\u201d</p><p>Annie thought about that for a second. \u201cSee, that\u2019s the hard part.\u201d</p><p>Usually Annie was very confident. She knew she was intelligent; she was a small-business owner and it was going well. She was independent and doubted that would ever change, even once she partnered up. And as for her modest upbringing, she had not yet met the person she\u2019d trade places with. Life on the farm was rich in many ways. She might\u2019ve had a moment of shallow jealousy over the skinny, fancy, city girl who could attract not only Nathaniel\u2019s attention, but acquire a big engagement rock, as well, but all that had passed pretty quickly.</p><p>There was one area in her life where her confidence was a little shaky, however. She\u2019d barely recovered from Ed. She\u2019d put a lot of faith and trust in a man who\u2019d clearly been using her. If this new guy, the big-shot vet, was really interested in her, he\u2019d have some proving to do. She wasn\u2019t going to be played for a fool. And she certainly wasn\u2019t going to be the only available two-legged female he\u2019d run across lately.</p> <p>Later that day after work, she fed Ahab, dug around in her refrigerator and fluffed up a nice green salad, fixed a plate of frosted brownies and headed for Nate\u2019s place.</p><p>When she pulled up to his house, a woman was just leaving the clinic, locking the door behind her. She was a tiny thing with salt-and-pepper hair cut supershort, and when she might have headed for the only car parked outside the clinic, she stopped and waited for Annie with a smile on her lips.</p><p>Annie approached her. \u201cYou must be Virginia,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you would be Annie McKenzie,\u201d the older woman said. \u201cNice to meet you. I met your parents some years ago, but I think all you kids were either at school or had maybe already left home. Nate\u2019s not home yet, but you have a key, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said. \u201cThanks for helping with those puppies. These are for you,\u201d she added on a whim, passing Virginia the plate of brownies.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have, but I\u2019m glad you did. Annie, tell Nathaniel to give you both the clinic and my home phone numbers and to leave your phone number for me. If we run into a situation when he\u2019s stuck out at a farm or ranch, we can work together to cover for him. I live in Clear River and he tells me you\u2019re in Fortuna. It\u2019s about the same distance for both of us to get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. And I\u2019ll tell him to call me first. I don\u2019t have a husband to irritate by running off somewhere to take care of puppies.\u201d</p><p>Virginia tilted her head, regarding her. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t talk about women, you know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYour husband?\u201d Annie answered, confused.</p><p>Virginia laughed. \u201cNathaniel. Can\u2019t get a word out of him about his love life. And I\u2019ve known him since he was this high,\u201d she said, her hand measuring about midthigh.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not much of a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s talked about you for a week now. Annie this, and Annie that.\u201d</p><p>Annie\u2019s eyes grew round and maybe a little panicked. \u201cThis and that what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI think he finds you delightful. Maybe amazing. You knew exactly what to do with the puppies because, raised by Hank and Rose, you were trained to know. And you\u2019re tall. For years he\u2019s been asking me if I\u2019ve always been this short. I think he likes tall women. When you were little, he said, you had a big batch of curly, carrot-orange hair, but you obviously outgrew it. You shot a mountain lion, butchered a cow, raised a blue-ribbon bull. Oh, and you\u2019re beautiful. But a little crabby, which he finds humorous.\u201d Virginia shook her head. \u201cNathaniel likes to try to find his way around a difficult woman,\u201d she said with a grin. \u201cBeing the youngest of four with three bossy older sisters, he can\u2019t help it, so don\u2019t let down your guard.\u201d</p><p>Annie laughed. No problem there\u2014her guard was up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice that you two have renewed your friendship,\u201d Virginia added.</p><p>\u201cBut, Virginia, we were never friends,\u201d Annie said. \u201cWe barely recall each other from childhood. He knew my older brothers, but not that well. We all went to different schools and might\u2019ve run into each other at fairs, 4-H stuff, that sort of thing. Really\u2014a long time ago. A couple of decades ago.\u201d</p><p>But the woman only flashed her friendly grin. \u201cIsn\u2019t it great when you renew an acquaintance with someone you have that kind of history with?\u201d</p><p>That kind of history? Annie wondered. That wasn\u2019t much history. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know each other as adults. Not at all.\u201d</p><p>Virginia laughed. \u201cBet that\u2019ll be the fun part. Now you call me if you need me,\u201d she said, moving toward her car. \u201cAnd thanks for the brownies! My husband will be as thrilled as I am!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Annie said. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Virginia paused at her car door. \u201cAnnie, if you need anything other than puppy care, don\u2019t hesitate to call on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long after Annie had spoken to Virginia and let herself into Nate\u2019s house that he came home. She heard his truck enter the garage, and when he walked in the door to the kitchen, his face lit up. \u201cHey,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d beat you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust got here,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd something smells good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just hope it also tastes good. I admit, Virginia gave me a hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shame in that, Nate.\u201d Then she smiled at him. Standing in the kitchen like that, waiting as he walked in the door after work, felt very nice. And then she told herself not to fantasize. Just one day at a time.</p><p>They fed the puppies and while a roast simmered in the Crock-Pot, complete with potatoes, carrots, onions and whole mushrooms, they let the puppies loose in the family room. They sat on the floor with them, a roll of paper towels handy, and laughed themselves stupid trying to keep track of the little animals, which escaped under the sofa, down the hall, behind furniture. They kept grabbing the puppies, counting, losing count, temporarily misplacing one. Nate estimated they were just over four weeks old because they were starting to bark, and every time one did, he or she fell over. It was better than television for entertainment.</p><p>After the puppies were put away again, dinner eaten, dishes cleaned up, Annie made noises about leaving, and Nate talked her into sitting down in the family room. \u201cIt\u2019s early,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s just turn on the TV for a while.\u201d</p><p>She plopped onto the couch. \u201cOh God,\u201d she said weakly. \u201cDon\u2019t let me get comfortable. I really have to go home. You have no idea how early I start my day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo you have eight whiny, hungry puppies in your laundry room? I start pretty early myself. Besides, I want you comfortable. This is such a great make-out couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shrugged like it was a stupid question. \u201cI\u2019ve made out on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019d be a gentleman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie, you just have to try me out\u2014I\u2019m going to be very gentlemanly about it. Come on, don\u2019t make me beg.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at him. \u201cBeg,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take.\u201d</p><p>He got an evil look in his eye and said, \u201cCome here.\u201d He snaked his fingers under her belt and tugged, pulling her down into the soft sofa cushions. \u201cLet\u2019s put a little flush on your cheeks.\u201d</p><p>The next night Annie took eight lengths of ribbon in eight different colors to Nate\u2019s house. They tied the ribbons around the puppies\u2019 necks, so they could be identifiable. They weighed them, made a chart, had dinner\u2014and Nathaniel was more than happy to put a flush on her cheeks again.</p><p>Night after night, she fed Ahab right after work so she\u2019d be free to\u2014ahem\u2014help with the puppies. And talk and play and kiss. The kissing quickly became her favorite part. Greedy for that, she trusted Pam to hold the shop open two nights a week and a half day on Monday. In exchange for that, Annie insisted Pam take a little comp time to get her own Christmas baking and shopping done; she came in late a few days to compensate.</p><p>There was more contributing to that flush of happiness on Annie\u2019s cheeks than just the kissing. Minor though it might seem, getting to know him when he had his shirt pulled out of his jeans and his boots off seemed so much more than casual. Of course her boots were off, also, and while they necked, their feet intertwined and they wiggled their toes. They wiggled against each other, too. It was delicious.</p><p>When they were feeding or cleaning up after puppies, preparing a meal together, they were also getting to know each other. Annie had never really thought about it before, but that was what courtship was all about\u2014figuring out if you had enough in common after the spark of desire to sustain a real relationship. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nathaniel had wanted to work with Thoroughbreds since he was a kid. He owned a couple of retired racehorses, good for riding. \u201cOne good stud can set you up for a great side business,\u201d he said. The initial investment, however, could be major. \u201cIn the next year or two, I\u2019m going to invest. See what I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not show horses?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, too, but I like the races.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love horses,\u201d she said. \u201cYou knew that. But did you know this? I\u2019ve competed in dressage events all over the state. When I was younger, of course. Eventually it became too expensive for me. The best training was never in my neighborhood and the biggest competitions, including for the Olympics, were out of my reach. But if I could ever do anything, I would teach beginner dressage. Maybe even intermediate.\u201d</p> <p>She told him she had thought about inviting him out to the farm to meet her parents and horses, but realized he already knew them. He knew them before he knew her, in fact. So she invited him to see her little Fortuna house and she made him dinner there. \u201cI don\u2019t have a great make-out couch, however,\u201d she warned him.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI needed that couch to get you going, but now that you\u2019re all warmed up, we can do it anywhere. The floor, the chair, against the wall, the car.....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so right about you. You\u2019re just arrogant.\u201d</p><p>He was also sentimental. Nathaniel was charmed by her two-bedroom house with a detached garage. The decorating was not prissy like a little dollhouse, but dominated by strong colors and leather furniture. The best part was, she had it completely decorated for Christmas, a garland over the hearth, lights up on the outside eaves. She had drizzled glitter on her huge poinsettia, had a Christmas cactus as big as a hydrangea bush, lots of what his mother had always called gewgaws. Ribbons, candles, potpourris, a Santa collection and, of course, a tree. A real tree, decorated to match the house\u2014in burgundy, green, cream and gold. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not even spending Christmas at home,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut I live here,\u201d she reminded him.</p> <p>\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make sense for me to put up decorations,\u201d he said. \u201cMother left a ton of them in the garage cabinets, but I\u2019m leaving before Christmas. And I didn\u2019t think anyone would be around to see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do it for myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m having holidays, too. I\u2019ll spend nights here since it gets so crowded at the farm. In years past, I\u2019ve been known to loan the house to one of the brothers and sisters-in-law and kids and just take the couch. Brad brings an RV, which the teenage boys pretty much commandeer. During summer visits, the kids stake out the barn and front porch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like fun. I think I would have liked that, growing up,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they all get here, will you let me meet them? Or re-meet them? I haven\u2019t seen the boys since junior high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, but you have to be prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to treat you like you\u2019re my boyfriend.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled and pulled her against him. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019d have a problem with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re in that place,\u201d she informed him. \u201cI think we just eat, talk, take care of puppies and kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie,\u201d he said as if disappointed. \u201cWhat do you think a boyfriend is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, I never really.....\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow is Sunday, your day at the farm with your folks,\u201d he said. \u201cGet done with whatever it is you do by early afternoon. Come for a ride with me. Let me show you my spread\u2014it\u2019s so peaceful in the snow. Bring a change of clothes so you can freshen up before we have dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>Annie had seen herself as plain and sturdy, until she\u2019d been under the lips and hands of Nathaniel Jensen, because he was so much more than she\u2019d ever reckoned with. Handsome, smart, funny, compassionate, independent, strong, sexy\u2014the list was endless. And he made her feel like so much more than a solid, dependable farm girl. When he kissed her, dared to touch her a bit more intimately than she invited, pulled his hands back when she said not yet, she felt sexy and pretty and adored. This was a man she looked forward to exploring, and she was taking him in slowly, with such pleasure.</p><p>So she told Rose she had a date to go riding with the vet and was, of course, excitedly excused from Sunday baking and dinner at the farm. \u201cPlease don\u2019t get all worked up,\u201d Annie told her mother. \u201cThis isn\u2019t anything special. We\u2019ve become friends on account of those puppies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d Rose said. \u201cStill, could you wear a little color to bring out your hair and eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, take it easy,\u201d Annie stressed. \u201cAnd don\u2019t mention it to anyone. I don\u2019t want to be the talk of the county the way that skinny Hollywood woman was.\u201d</p><p>But Annie wasn\u2019t taking it lightly\u2014she was almost sizzling with pleasure. And she tried dressing up a little more. For riding, she wore her best jeans, newest boots and oldest denim jacket over a red turtleneck sweater. She added a black scarf. She brought along attractive slacks and high-heeled boots with a silk blouse and her best suede blazer to wear for dinner afterward. They talked about horses while they rode two of Nate\u2019s favorite mounts, a couple of valuable, albeit retired, Thoroughbreds, disciplined and with just the right amount of spirit. The conversation about breeding, training, racing and showing horses was so stimulating she could almost forget for a while that she was trying not to fall in love with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not around horse people enough anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I was riding in competition as a girl, that was enough to keep me occupied twenty-four hours a day. No wonder I didn\u2019t have fun in college\u2014I wasn\u2019t riding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good on a horse,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should ride every day. So should I\u2014it\u2019s the best part of what I do.\u201d</p><p>They rode into the foothills behind Nate\u2019s stables along a trail that, although covered by a layer of snow, had been well used. The trees rose high above them and the sun was lowering in the afternoon sky. They talked about growing up as the youngest in their families, and the only one of their gender. While Annie\u2019s brothers treated her like a football, Nathaniel\u2019s older sisters played with him as if he were a baby doll they could dress up at will. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing I\u2019m not weirder than I am,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next oldest is Patricia, who\u2019s thirty-seven. Then Susan, and the oldest is Christina\u2014one every two years. My parents had decided to quit while they were ahead and then, bingo.\u201d He grinned. \u201cMe. I upset the balance in a big way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think a similar thing happened at the farm,\u201d she said. \u201cThe boys are thirty-three, thirty-four and thirty-seven. Then I came along and upset the bedroom situation. My parents decided I had to have my own, which left one for the boys. And then I raised a bull\u2014did I mention he won a blue ribbon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral times, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe actually needed him. We had a couple of old bulls who just couldn\u2019t step up to the plate anymore, y\u2019know? But Erasmus was Ready Freddy. I\u2019m real proud of that old bull.\u201d She smiled. \u201cMy brothers had their shot at raising animals and they did all right, but Erasmus was the blue-ribbon baby. I blew my brothers out of the 4-H water with that guy.\u201d She sighed wistfully. \u201cI think having a daughter was harder on my dad and brothers than being the only girl was on me. And being the only girl wasn\u2019t easy. They were ruthless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet protective?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an uncomfortable place sometimes, to be tossed around like a beanbag and hovered over like a china doll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they make it hard on your boyfriends?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThere weren\u2019t very many boyfriends,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d he replied with a grin. \u201cYou\u2019re lying to make me feel better.\u201d</p><p>So she told him about Ed. She hadn\u2019t planned to, but this was a perfect segue to explaining that she might have an issue or two with trust. Not only had the man in the only really serious relationship of her adult life cheated on her, horribly, but she had never had a clue. That bothered her. After it was over, it was so obvious, but while it was going on, she was oblivious. Not good.</p><p>They were headed back toward the stables when she told him. She expected him to be sympathetic and sweet. Instead, he was fascinated. \u201cAre you serious? He had about three women going at once? Scattered around? Telling each one he was in love with only her? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d she said, annoyed.</p><p>\u201cHow in the world did he manage that?\u201d Nate asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, a lot of phone calls while he was working. He talked to each one of us every day, sometimes several times a day. But with very few exceptions, we were assigned certain nights. We thought those were the days he didn\u2019t have to leave town. I should have known where I stood in the line. I was getting Mondays and Tuesdays. The woman he decided was the real one in his life was getting the weekends\u2014Saturdays and Sundays. She dumped him, of course, when she discovered Ms. Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. Three days a week must be the trump, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly cow,\u201d Nate said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even need a house or apartment! He had all his nights covered!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m not impressed by his ability to pull it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re not,\u201d Nate said. \u201cBut if you just think about it, he had quite a scam going. Did he take you lots of places? Buy you nice things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t do either,\u201d she explained. \u201cFirst of all, he couldn\u2019t risk being seen out and about with a woman, since one of the other women or their friends might run into him. So he said he was so tired, and after a week of being on the road and eating in restaurants, he enjoyed staying home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere you could cook for him,\u201d Nate stated.</p><p>She pursed her lips, narrowed her eyes and nodded. \u201cHe did buy me a hot-water heater when mine went out,\u201d she admitted. \u201cHe might\u2019ve needed that hot shower,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cThe man\u2019s a genius,\u201d Nate said. Then upon studying her face, he said, \u201cOh he\u2019s a bastard, but you have to give him some credit for all the planning and subterfuge that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI give him no credit,\u201d she said harshly.</p><p>He grabbed her hand then, pulled her closer and said, \u201cOf course not. No credit. He should be killed. But I\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t choose you. What if he\u2019d chosen you? Can you imagine? We\u2019d never meet and fall in love!\u201d</p><p>She was so stunned that she pulled back on the reins and stopped her horse. \u201cAre we in love?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m just getting started here\u2014there\u2019s lots of potential. And he doesn\u2019t deserve you. I, however, deserve you. And will take you anywhere you want. And I\u2019m going to hold your hand the whole time. I\u2019ll feed you cookies and kiss your neck in public.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPeople will think I\u2019m your girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I want people to think. I\u2019m going to start right away. We\u2019re going to go out. We\u2019ll drive into town to look at Christmas decorations, go to Virgin River to check out the tree and have some of Preacher\u2019s dinner, and then I\u2019m going to take you to a nice restaurant on the weekend. And anything else you feel like doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI want everyone to know you\u2019re with me. I want everyone to know you\u2019re not Sundays and Mondays\u2014you\u2019re every day.\u201d</p> <p>Again she pulled back on the reins and stopped her horse. \u201cWhat\u2019s sexier than a string bikini, Nathaniel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d He reined in beside her. His voice grew quiet and serious. He rubbed a knuckle down her cheek, over her jaw, gazing into her dark eyes. \u201cDenim turns me on. Long legs in jeans and boots astride a big horse, making him dance to subtle commands. A rough workshirt under a down vest, feeding a newborn foal with a bottle because the mare isn\u2019t responding.\u201d He threaded his fingers into her hair and said, \u201cSilk, instead of cotton candy. A fire on a cold, snowy night. A woman in my arms, soft and content, happy with the same things that make me happy. Help making homemade pizza\u2014that turns me on. A woman who knows how to deliver a calf when there\u2019s trouble\u2014that blows my horn. A woman who can muck out a stall and then fall into the fresh hay and let me fall right on top of her. I\u2019d like to try that real soon.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes clouded a bit. \u201cAre you just leading me on? Because when Ed pulled his trick, my brothers wanted to kill him, but I wouldn\u2019t let them. You? If you\u2019re lying, I\u2019m going to let them. You\u2019ll suffer before you die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying, Annie. And you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, okay, then answer this\u2014if you like me, why haven\u2019t you liked someone before me? Because these hills are full of girls just like me\u2014sturdy farm girls who have pulled their share of foals from the dams, fed them and kept them warm and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, there aren\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking. Just like you, I haven\u2019t had a whole lot of dates because there really wasn\u2019t anyone like you. You\u2019re one of a kind, Annie McKenzie. I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t seem to know that. But now that I\u2019ve found you, we need to date.....and a whole lot more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe warned,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not casual about this stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d he said.</p><p>After they put up the horses\u2019 tack and brushed them down, when it was time to change for dinner, he suggested they share a shower.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, Nate. Not yet,\u201d she said. \u201cDoes my door lock?\u201d And he laughed at her.</p><p>On the way to Arcata they enjoyed the multicolored Christmas lights all along the coastal towns and up into the mountains. The Arcata square was decorated with lights, lit-up trees and a life-size nativity scene. Many of the shop windows were also decorated and filled with Christmas ornaments, gaily dressed mannequins and animated toys. Just as he\u2019d promised, he held her hand everywhere they went. He had chosen an Italian restaurant on the square, and as it happened, it was one of her favorites. It boasted homemade pasta, robust red wine and excellent tiramisu.</p> <p>\u201cWhen are your brothers and their families arriving?\u201d he asked over dinner.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d she said. \u201cBy the way, you\u2019re invited to dinner. Please be cool around my brothers and don\u2019t give anything away. They haven\u2019t grown up at all since you knew them, despite the fact they have sons of their own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be cool, all right,\u201d he promised. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry.\u201d And then he grinned.</p><p>Five</p><p>It was a successful date, proved by the way they were in each other\u2019s arms, kissing deeply, before they were even in his house. It was still early enough to get in a good, long session of kissing on that soft, deep, inviting couch, and they fell on it together, taking turns helping each other out of boots and jackets without hardly breaking the kiss. Within moments they were in their favorite position on that great sofa, lined up against each other, exploring the inner softness of their mouths. Her body grew predictably supple and soft while his grew more urgent and hard.</p><p>Nathaniel whispered, \u201cAnnie. Come to my bed.\u201d</p><p>And she said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d he answered weakly. \u201cAnnie, you don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do mean it. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you kiss me like you\u2019re ready. Why not?\u201d</p><p>She pushed herself up on the couch just slightly so she could look at his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ve only known each other three weeks, for starters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve kind of known you my whole life, even if I haven\u2019t known you since you got your braces off. But I\u2019ve known you intensely for three weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe knew each other superficially for one week and intensely for the next two weeks. I might require a little more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I just broke up with Ed. Six months ago. It isn\u2019t that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s forever,\u201d he said. \u201cI should have made you forget he ever existed by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think in another couple of weeks, I will have forgotten. And I\u2019d kind of like to know how you feel after you\u2019ve had your chance to lie on the beach surrounded by beautiful bodies in very small bathing suits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that. Listen, that\u2019s not even part of the equation,\u201d he said. \u201cReally. That trip has nothing to do with how I feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to do with how I feel,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnnie, if I hadn\u2019t made arrangements for this vacation long before I met you, I sure wouldn\u2019t plan it now. And it was a lot more than wanting to be lost in bikinis, believe me. It was a very convenient, very convincing plan, so I wouldn\u2019t find myself held hostage on a cruise ship with all my sisters and their kids. I explained\u2014my brothers-in-law are great, but when their wives are around....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have to act like husbands and fathers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs opposed to regular guys,\u201d he clarified with a nod. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on a couple of fishing trips together and I\u2019m telling you, these guys are the best. They are my brothers. But when my sisters and the kids are around.....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHusbands and fathers,\u201d she said helpfully again.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m bored out of my mind. The only reprieve I get is a brandy and cigar with my dad and a conversation about veterinary medicine. Come on, don\u2019t you feel sorry for me? It\u2019s murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re not looking forward to seeing all your old buds?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat? Sure, that\u2019ll be great. We used to study together several nights a week. And then after graduation, we went off in all directions. This was a great idea Jerry had, but I can think of things I\u2019d rather do.\u201d He lifted one eyebrow and grinned lasciviously.</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cStill, I\u2019m not ready. Not till after your Club Med vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Club Med, I told you. Are you waiting for me to say I love you, because if you\u2019re waiting for that, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She put a finger to his lips and shushed him. \u201cDon\u2019t go out on a limb here, Nathaniel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call the travel agent in the morning and get you a ticket,\u201d he said. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, actually pleased by the offer. \u201cMy goodness, you\u2019ll go to a lot of trouble and expense for sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you,\u201d he clarified. \u201cNot just for sex, for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am kind of impressed, but no thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrdinarily, if it were another time of year, I would, but not this time. Plus, I don\u2019t get to be with the whole family that often. The boys have it worked out that they do either Thanksgiving or Christmas with our side, the other holiday with their wives\u2019 side. So it\u2019s been a couple of years since we\u2019ve all done Christmas together and I love that. My mom and I knock ourselves out to make it great.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her deeply. He pressed her down into the sofa with his body and held her hands at her sides, entwining his fingers with hers. \u201cHow about if I decide not to go on that vacation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019ve paid for? To see your old best friends from school? Don\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I won\u2019t go,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou have to go. This is important, Nathaniel. You should get away, broaden your horizons. You\u2019ve probably forgotten how much you miss your friends, how much you\u2019d like to see a hundred tiny bikinis on perfect women. You have to go. I\u2019m kind of interested in what you\u2019ll be like when you come back.\u201d</p><p>He thought about this for a few seconds. \u201cOkay, then,\u201d he whispered. \u201cA compromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to the stupid beach without you, my virtuous girlfriend, you\u2019ll have Christmas with your family, and tonight you come to my bed.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo. Not till you\u2019ve passed your time with the bikinis. And the women vets you used to date. Are they pretty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTina and Cindy? Oh, yeah, very pretty, but like I said, we were better as study partners. Honey, I\u2019ve completely lost interest in bikinis. Unless you want to put one on for me just for fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that that will ever happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie, I\u2019m not interested in bikinis. Not now. I\u2019m only interested in you. Hey! This doesn\u2019t have anything to do with skinny Susanna, does it? Because I\u2019m not all weirded out by Ed, who\u2019s really much stranger than Susanna.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThe only thing about Susanna that I still have to get over is that she was beautiful, feminine, small\u2014except for her apparently exceptional boobs\u2014and fancy, while I\u2019m flat-footed and can cut the head off a chicken. But I\u2019m working on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t real,\u201d he said. \u201cShe bought herself a pair for her twenty-first birthday. I\u2019d much rather touch smaller real ones.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him, a short one on the lips. \u201cWell, Nathaniel, if this works out, I like your chances.\u201d Then she grinned at him.</p><p>He was quiet for a moment and his eyes were serious, burning into hers. \u201cYou know, if I hadn\u2019t already paid for the whole damn thing, I\u2019d cancel that trip. It\u2019s not what I want right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I want you to go, and you\u2019ll have a good time. I\u2019m not really worried about the bikinis. Not that much.\u201d</p><p>He pressed himself against her, proof that he was still all turned on. \u201cIt turns out three weeks is enough time for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d rather just not go.\u201d</p><p>She put a hand against his cheek and smiled at him. \u201cEven a grand gesture like that wouldn\u2019t get you lucky tonight.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be away from you for ten days. I barely found you. What if stupid Ed comes around and somehow proves to you that he\u2019s worth another chance?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t happen,\u201d she said. \u201cI hardly remember what he looks like.

I\u2019ve been thinking about that a lot because it\u2019s been a real issue with me, that somehow I didn\u2019t know. I think Ed wasn\u2019t that important to me, or I would have been upset we had so little time together, and I wasn\u2019t. Wouldn\u2019t I have known something was off if he\u2019d meant more to me? I don\u2019t think I cared as much as I wanted to. Lord, I think I would have married him even knowing he\u2019d only spend two nights a week with me.\u201d She took a breath. \u201cMaybe I would\u2019ve married him because he\u2019d only spend two nights a week with me.\u201d She ran her fingernails through the hair at Nate\u2019s temple. \u201cBut much as I fight it, Nathaniel, it\u2019s different with you.\u201d Then she smiled.</p><p>\u201cIn only three weeks?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>She was shaking her head. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take three whole weeks.\u201d</p><p>He took a breath, then groaned deeply just before he covered her mouth in a deep, hot, wet kiss that went on and on and on. When he finally lifted his lips from hers, he said, \u201cOkay. We\u2019ll do this your way. We\u2019ll wait until you\u2019re ready. And when it\u2019s over and we\u2019re together forever, don\u2019t think you can boss me around like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a deal,\u201d she said, laughing.</p> <p>Nathaniel called Annie twice before noon on Monday. First he wanted to know if there was anything he could bring to the farm. \u201cI think we\u2019re throwing a couple of big pans of lasagna in the oven for dinner, and Mom is busy making bread. How about bringing some good red wine?\u201d</p><p>The next time he called, he said, \u201cI know you work on Tuesday. I\u2019m leaving Tuesday afternoon. So tonight, if I pass the brother test, will you come home with me for just a little while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor just a little while. And don\u2019t try that \u2018I\u2019m going into battle and you have to show your love before I leave\u2019 trick. Okay?\u201d</p><p>And he laughed.</p><p>That was the best part about Annie\u2014her sense of humor. No, he thought\u2014it was her beauty. Her dark red hair, her creamy, freckled complexion, her deep brown eyes. But then a smile came to his lips as he recalled how good she was on a horse. An accomplished equestrienne. And while she would not find the term sturdy at all complimentary, he admired that about her. Fortitude had always appealed to him. Sometimes when he was holding her, he felt like he was clinging to her as if she anchored him to the ground. She had no idea how unattractive flighty, timid, weak women were to him. Did such women make some men feel strong and capable? Because for Nathaniel, to be chosen by a woman of strength and confidence met needs he didn\u2019t even know he had.</p><p>He had calls to make, ranches to visit, patients to see, inoculations to administer, a couple of cows who had a fungus to look in on, breeding animals who would deliver early in the year to check. He phoned the vet from Eureka who would cover for him while he was away, paid a visit to a local winery to select a few bottles of good red and finally made his way to the McKenzie farm.</p> <p>When he pulled in, the place almost resembled a fair in progress. Not one but two RVs were parked near the back of the house, which probably eliminated the need to borrow Annie\u2019s house for the family. There were also trucks and snowmobiles on trailers. A bunch of cross-country skis leaned up against the back porch. The McKenzies were here to play. Kids ran around while several sat on the top rail of the corral. Inside the corral, Annie had a couple of young children mounted on her horses. She held the reins and led them around the corral while they held the saddle pommels. Four men\u2014her brothers and father\u2014leaned on the rail, watching.</p><p>Nate wandered up to the fence and leaned his forearms on the top rail with the rest of them. \u201cSo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m here for the inspection.\u201d</p><p>The man next to him turned and his mouth split into a huge grin. \u201cHey, man,\u201d Beau McKenzie said. \u201cI heard a rumor you were dating my sister. Good to see you, buddy.\u201d He stuck out his hand. \u201cThis true? You and Annie? Because I can tell you things that will give you ultimate control over her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathaniel Jensen,\u201d the next man said. Brad McKenzie stuck out his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen you in twenty years! You finally made it over five foot six, good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and beat the acne.\u201d Nate laughed. \u201cHow you doing, pal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJim, any chance you remember this clown?\u201d Beau asked his oldest brother.</p><p>\u201cI just remember this squirt from football,\u201d Jim McKenzie said, sticking out a hand. \u201cCouldn\u2019t tackle worth shit, but you sure could run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to run,\u201d Nate said. \u201cIf anyone had caught me, I\u2019d be dead. I was the smallest kid on the team.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou take steroids or something? You caught up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I just got old like the rest of you,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks for letting me invade the family party. Annie\u2019s been looking forward to it so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is true, then?\u201d Beau asked, Brad and Jim and even Hank looking on with rather intense gazes.</p><p>What had she said? That he\u2019d have to be cool? Maybe she expected him to joke around the way they did? One side of his mouth tilted up in a sly smile. He supposed it wasn\u2019t cool, but could they beat him up for being honest? \u201cShe knocks me out,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere have you been hiding her? I didn\u2019t even know she was here! I bumped into her in a bar!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s our Annie,\u201d Beau said. \u201cOut tying one on.\u201d</p><p>Nate laughed again. \u201cActually, she rescued eight orphaned puppies. Mostly border collie, we think. Cute as the devil. How many you want?\u201d</p><p>Beau put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cPass on the puppies, my friend. But we got beer, Nathaniel. And seriously, we can give you stuff on her that will give you years worth of control. Power. Mastery. Don\u2019t we, guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do,\u201d said Brad.</p><p>\u201cIndeedy,\u201d said Jim.</p><p>It was an amazing day for Nathaniel, though not exactly a brand-new experience. The venue was a little smaller and more crowded than his family gatherings, but the family interaction was pretty much the same as in his family. The men got a little too loud, the kids ran wild and had to be rounded up several times, the women had a little tiff about kitchen things like whether the bread should have garlic butter or not and whether the salad should be dressed or not. There was a lot of furniture moving to accommodate a dinner for seventeen. They needed the dining-room table extended, and two card tables. The youngest child present at dinner was three and the oldest fourteen, and they sat at the kid table, as it was known in both the Jensen and McKenzie households. Nathaniel felt at once a special guest and right at home.</p><p>The McKenzie boys had married well; their wives were attractive, fun, energetic, and there was a lot of family rapport\u2014which always helped. The kids were mostly well behaved, just a couple of small problems that the mothers foisted off on the fathers. Mrs. McKenzie fussed over Nate in a welcoming fashion, maybe a hopeful fashion, showing her approval. Mr. McKenzie, whom Nate had only known as Hank for the couple of years he\u2019d been practicing here, handed Nate his jacket and took him out to the front porch during the after-dinner cleanup. Hank gave him a cigar. None of the brothers joined them, so Nate knew this was the father-and-man-in-his-daughter\u2019s-life talk.</p><p>Hank lit Nate\u2019s cigar. \u201cI don\u2019t have a whole lot to say about this. Always got along with you just fine, so I don\u2019t have any basic complaint,\u201d Hank said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Nate said, puffing. Coughing. He smoked about a cigar a year and never remembered to take it easy.</p><p>\u201cJust a couple of things I want to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Annie,\u201d her father said. \u201cShe\u2019s good people.\u201d He puffed. \u201cNow that might not seem like much of a recommendation, but in my book, it\u2019s the best there is. She\u2019s just plain good. She\u2019d never in a million years hurt a soul. But don\u2019t get lazy on her, because she\u2019s nice but she\u2019s tough. She can hold her own if there\u2019s some injustice, and she\u2019s not afraid of a fight. And smart? She could\u2019ve run this dairy farm single-handed, she\u2019s that smart. That strong-willed. I offered it to her, too. Boys didn\u2019t want it, so I said, \u2018Annie, you could do it just fine, even if I dropped dead tomorrow,\u2019 and she said, \u2018Dad, if I stick myself out here with the cows, I\u2019ll never leave and never do anything else and I think maybe there\u2019s got to be more to my life. At least more people in my life.\u2019 That\u2019s what she said. So that\u2019s how it was. She bought that beauty shop and I sold off the Holsteins. You better be nice to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about hurting her, Nathaniel. I can handle about anything but seeing my girl, who I admire and respect, hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d Nate said.</p><p>\u201cBecause if you do.....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll shoot me?\u201d Nate asked.</p><p>\u201cAw, hell, why would I do that? I\u2019m not a violent man. I\u2019ll just spread the word that as a vet, you\u2019re not worth a crap.\u201d</p><p>Nate couldn\u2019t help it, he burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cThe boys, though,\u201d Hank went on, \u201cthey\u2019re a tad violent. When it comes to Annie. So be nice.\u201d</p><p>Nate hadn\u2019t had a lot of dates in the past couple of years, but in the past ten he\u2019d had quite a few. When he was tending Thoroughbreds in Kentucky and then in Los Angeles County, plenty of women were attracted to him. Socialites, daughters of rich breeders, women he\u2019d met at parties, on ranches, at races. He\u2019d never been talked to by a father, however. Not even Susanna\u2019s, not even when he\u2019d given her a rock and carted her up to Humboldt County with the misguided notion of marrying her.</p><p>As father talks went, Hank\u2019s hadn\u2019t been stunning. But Nate liked it. It made him feel like a man with a job to do.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably way too early to talk about intentions,\u201d Hank said.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir, it\u2019s not,\u201d Nate replied. \u201cI like Annie even more than you do. It\u2019s my intention to treat her very well while we\u2019re dating, and I think it might be a good match for both of us. I also think we might have a future, me and Annie. But you know what? She\u2019s a smart, stubborn girl\u2014it\u2019s going to be up to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I reckon,\u201d Hank said.</p><p>\u201cSo. Could you at least wish me luck?\u201d Nathaniel asked.</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d Hank said, sticking out his hand. \u201cBest of luck there, Nathaniel. Try not to screw this up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet, sir. Nice cigar, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, not bad, huh? Have no idea where I got \u2019em. One of the boys, probably.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nate wasn\u2019t sure, but he didn\u2019t think his own father had ever had one of these talks with his brothers-in-law or he would\u2019ve heard about it. But right there, right then, he decided that if he ever had a daughter, he was going to do that. It was a good idea\u2014take the young man aside, expound on the girl\u2019s wonderful qualities, threaten his life a little. It had merit.</p><p>A few minutes later Beau joined them, clipping off the tip of a cigar. Then Brad, then Jim. Nate leaned close to Beau\u2019s ear. \u201cHow\u2019d you know he was done with me?\u201d Nate asked.</p><p>\u201cIf he wasn\u2019t done, you weren\u2019t going to work out,\u201d Beau said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cJust out of curiosity,\u201d Nate asked, \u201chas he had many of these talks?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you\u2019re the first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about that loser, Ed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Ed. I don\u2019t think Annie brought him around all that much. From what we heard, he was very busy. I met him once, I think, and not on a holiday. He did sell a couple of things to my dad, though. Farm things. Before he and Annie hooked up. Dad? We didn\u2019t like Ed much, did we?\u201d</p><p>Hank just snorted and said something derisive under his breath.</p><p>\u201cJust out of curiosity, why didn\u2019t you like him?\u201d Nate asked.</p> <p>\u201cHe swindled me on a hay baler,\u201d Hank said. \u201cSaid he had the best price in the county. Took me about a month to find all kinds of better deals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it didn\u2019t have anything to do with how he treated her?\u201d Nate asked.</p><p>\u201cSon, you really think if a man will swindle you on a hay baler, you can trust him with your kin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t ever thought about it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine another way to think about it,\u201d Hank said.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Nate said, feeling more than a little privileged. Yeah, he thought. I\u2019m picking out my daughter\u2019s guy and giving him a talking-to.</p> <p>When the cigars were finished, the men wandered back inside where the women were sitting in the kitchen with coffee. Nate paused in the doorway and signaled Annie. \u201cGot a second?\u201d he asked her. When she stood before him, he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to get a head start. Spend as much time as you want with the family. I\u2019ll go home and make sure the puppies are fed and watered and their bedding is dry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can come now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, stay. I\u2019ll get the puppy chores done and when you get there, I\u2019ll have more time with you. By the way, are we all set on their care while I\u2019m gone? We talked about it a little......\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to worry, Nate. Virginia and I worked out the details. We\u2019re going to share the load and they\u2019ll be looked after. And if it\u2019s okay with you, I\u2019ll make sure the adopted ones are delivered on Christmas Eve. I think Pam from the shop is going to take one, which brings us down to three left to place. I\u2019ll make sure they\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell anyone you take a pup to that if they bring \u2019em by in a couple of weeks, I\u2019ll check them over and give them shots, free of charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice, Nathaniel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll see you in a little while,\u201d he said, giving her a platonic peck on the cheek. \u201cThank you, Mrs. McKenzie,\u201d he said to Rose. \u201cNice meeting you all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a great trip, Nate,\u201d someone said.</p> <p>\u201cGood meeting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTravel safe.\u201d</p><p>He shook the men\u2019s hands and was on his way.</p><p>Two thoughts occupied him as he drove home. He couldn\u2019t wait to get his arms around Annie. And he didn\u2019t want to be away from her for ten days. He didn\u2019t think a beach full of naked women could make him more inclined to leave right now. But he had packed his bags earlier, not leaving it to the last minute, and he would get this over with. Then, as far as he was concerned, it was full steam ahead with her. And she\u2019d better not give him the slip, either. He was thirty-two and had had plenty of girlfriends, but he couldn\u2019t remember ever wanting a woman like he wanted this one. Heck, he wanted her whole family. He wanted to bring her into his. He wanted them to merge and grow.</p><p>He\u2019d even been engaged without wanting all that. It was eerie.</p><p>He was barely home, the puppies slopping up their dinner, when the pager on his belt vibrated. He recognized the phone number of a horse breeder whose animals he took care of. His favorite patients, Thoroughbreds. This family was not nearby\u2014they were over the county line in Mendocino.</p><p>He answered the call. One of their valuable broodmares was miscarrying, and she was all freaked out, kicking at the stable walls.</p><p>He disconnected the line, but he held the phone. He took a deep, disappointed breath before he dialed the McKenzie farm and asked for Annie.</p><p>\u201cNate? What\u2019s up?\u201d she asked when she came on the line.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how much I hate to do this. I have to go out on an emergency. There\u2019s a mare miscarrying, and the stable is in the next county. It could be complicated. It could be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the time, Nate. See about the horse,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHoney, you shouldn\u2019t wait here for me. I might be tied up until very late. There\u2019s a chance I\u2019ll be out all night with just enough time to come home, clean up, get ready to leave. But, Annie, I won\u2019t leave without seeing you\u2014worst case, I\u2019ll stop by your shop on my way out of town tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that, Nate. If you find yourself pressed for time, just give me a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do have to,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI can\u2019t leave without holding you, without kissing you goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so sweet. But if it doesn\u2019t work out that way, I understand. Drive carefully. I hope everything is all right with the mare.\u201d</p><p>Despite Nate\u2019s warning that he might not make it home until very late, she went to his house anyway. She could hear in his voice his desire to spend a little time with her, and what did she have to keep her away? If he wasn\u2019t back by early morning, she\u2019d feed the puppies and go home to shower and get ready for work.</p><p>She was inexplicably drawn to the master bedroom, though she had no real reason to go there. It was the sight of a couple of suitcases open on the floor, filled with clothing, that saddened her so deeply she felt a small ache in her heart. Oh, she was going to miss him so much! Disappointment filled her\u2014she had looked forward to an hour or two of cuddling before she had to give him up for his ten-day adventure. Now it was probably not to be.</p><p>Suck it up, Annie, she said to herself. And with that, she shucked her jacket and went to make sure the puppies were taken care of. \u201cWell, my little loves,\u201d she said to the box of squirming, jumping, yelping, vibrating puppies. \u201cEw,\u201d she said, taking a sniff. \u201cTime for a refresh, I see.\u201d And she set about the task of giving her little charges clean fur and dry bedding. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re ready for new homes. You have to be about six weeks by now. Close enough, as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d</p><p>Her puppy chores didn\u2019t take long. She wandered into the family room and sat on that comfy sofa. That lonely sofa. She hated to leave prematurely; she wanted to give him time to get home, to catch up with her. As she looked around the family room, it seemed so barren. At least compared to the farmhouse, which was full to the brim with food, decorations, people, laughter and happiness.</p><p>She turned on the fire to make it more welcoming for him, and then on a whim she went to the garage and looked through the storage cabinets that lined the walls of the three-port garage. She smiled to herself. Nathaniel\u2019s mother had certainly made it easy. One entire cabinet held boxes that were neatly labeled. She skipped the one that said \u201cornaments\u201d but opened another. And another. And another.</p><p>She really only meant to bring a touch of Christmas into the house for Nate, even if it was only for one night, or just an early morning. First was a centerpiece for that long, oak kitchen table, then a couple of fat, glittery candles on a bed of artificial holly, which she put on the coffee table. She thought if she were decorating this house for real, there would be lots of fresh stuff and the smell of pine. And the aroma of hot chocolate and cookies.</p><p>She put her jacket on to go back into the garage and soon she had a garland for the mantel, stockings and brass stocking holders, and three-foot-tall nutcracker characters for a grouping in the corner. She found a large basket of red ceramic apples mixed with huge pinecones, a poinsettia with little twinkling lights. That gave her another idea, and she found some tiny tree lights in a box, which she brought in and used to adorn the house plants\u2014a couple of tall ficus trees and a couple of lush philodendron and ivy. She tied thick, red velvet bows to the backs of the kitchen chairs.</p><p>A box labeled \u201cChristmas dishes\u201d was just too much to resist. Inside were some festive plates and cups. So she turned on the oven and poked around in the pantry, laughing to herself. Hadn\u2019t she said she wouldn\u2019t poke around? Well, Nathaniel obviously didn\u2019t do a lot of baking, and who knew how long that canister of flour had been there? And the brown sugar was like a brick. But he did have butter, sugar and M&amp;M\u2019s. It took only thirty minutes to produce a plate of pseudo chocolate-chip cookies. She found chocolate-milk mix and fixed up a couple of cups with spoons in them, ready for filling. It was probably in her DNA\u2014she covered the festive plate of cookies with plastic wrap.</p><p>\u201cChristmas for a day,\u201d she said to herself, pleased.</p><p>She made sure all the boxes were stowed in the garage. Then she looked at the clock. Almost eleven, and she had to get up early for work. But it didn\u2019t take her a second to make her decision\u2014a girl doesn\u2019t find a quality boyfriend every day. She turned down some lights in the house, took off her boots, reclined on the sofa in front of the fire with the throw over her legs and promptly fell asleep.</p><p>Six</p><p>Nate was was physically tired and emotionally drained. By the time he reached the Bledsoe stables, the mare had miscarried a five-month foal and she was skittish. Frantic might be a better word. Indication was that the horse was sick, the cause of the miscarriage, though Nate had checked her over before she was bred and she\u2019d been in good shape. Because he wasn\u2019t going to be around to follow up, he had called Dr. Conner, the Eureka vet. He tranquilized the mare to calm her, administered antibiotics, made sure the placenta was whole, and then transported the products of conception to Eureka so that Dr. Conner could follow up with a postmortem to try to determine the cause. Conner would probably choose to do an endometrial biopsy. Other horses in the stable would have to be examined immediately; Bledsoe had six breeding at the moment.</p><p>But that was not the hardest part. Not only was the mare valuable and the stud a champion, the owners\u2019 teenage daughter had raised this horse from a filly and it was her first foal. The girl was as distraught as the horse, and terrified her mare was going to die.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to die, but the jury was still out on whether she was a good broodmare. Some mystery problem or illness had taken its toll and caused her to drop the foal and suffer a considerable amount of bleeding. Time and follow-up would tell the story. But when Nate left the family, quite late at night, it looked as though the teenage girl was going to sleep in the stable with her horse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now that was something he could see Annie doing.</p><p>And to speak of the devil herself, when he pulled up to his house, it was dimly lit from inside and her truck was parked out front. The clock on the car console said two-fifteen. Lord, what was she doing? Half of him was so grateful he could burst, the other half wanted to spank her for staying up so late\u2014he knew she had a long day in the shop ahead of her so that she could be closed the afternoon of the twenty-fourth and all day the twenty-fifth.</p><p>Annie, he had learned, was not afraid of hard work.</p><p>He entered the dimly lit house quietly. His first reaction was surprise, but pleasure quickly followed. On the breakfast bar a thick red candle flickered beside a plate of cookies and a couple of cups. There was chocolate powder in the cups, ready for hot milk to be added. Bows on the chairs, garlands strung around, table decorations, twinkling lights everywhere, and his girl, asleep in front of a fire. He chuckled to himself. Well, hadn\u2019t she been busy.</p> <p>It was like really coming home. Holidays meant a lot to her. Her sense of love and family spilled over to everyone around her, and he felt so.....embraced inside, like it was his first Christmas. He smiled to himself. In an important way, it was.</p><p>He took off his boots, belt and jacket in the kitchen. He blew out candles, turned off all but the twinkling tree lights and fireplace, and knelt down by the sofa, softly kissing her beautiful lips.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she murmured, half waking. \u201cYou\u2019re home. I must\u2019ve fallen asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were probably exhausted, digging through the storage,\u201d he said with humor in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put it all away before you get back,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI should go, now you\u2019re home......\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d he asked. He slipped one arm under her knees, the other behind her back and stood with her in his arms. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get some sleep. It\u2019s almost morning, anyway. And this couch isn\u2019t going to do it. I want to hold you. I want to fall asleep with you in my arms. Now close your eyes and your mouth.\u201d</p><p>She hummed and snuggled closer to him. \u201cEverything all right? With the mare?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll get sorted out. I\u2019ll tell you about it in the morning.\u201d He carried her to his bedroom and laid her gently on the bed. \u201cDo you need the alarm?\u201d he asked her. \u201cI can set it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I haven\u2019t slept past seven in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said. He pulled back the comforter and crawled in, jeans and all, and she did the same. \u201cCome close,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I want in life is to feel you against me. Mmm, just like that. Aaah, Annie, my Annie.....\u201d</p><p>Suddenly he knew that even as exhausted as he was, he wasn\u2019t going to sleep. He had a stunning thought\u2014this is what it feels like when you actually fall in love. He\u2019d thought that whole falling-in-love thing was some girl story that guys didn\u2019t experience. He was familiar with being attracted. Oh-ho, was he familiar with that! And of course he had known desire in all sizes, from warm to boiling. Wanting a woman, yes, that was a fairly regular occurrence. But this was all those things mixed together and yet something completely different at the same time.</p> <p>He wanted to be only with Annie; if he were allowed one friend for the rest of his life, he would choose her. He wanted to come home to the kind of warmth she could bring to a room. He wanted to crawl in beside her and feel the comfort of her body, which fit so perfectly against his. He didn\u2019t want to be away from her; he wanted her for life.</p><p>He began unbuttoning her blouse. In spite of the fact that she seemed to be asleep, he was undressing her, knowing he shouldn\u2019t. But then he felt her fingers working away at his shirt buttons and he sprang to life, hard and ready. His hands went to the snap on her jeans while hers worked at his. Like choreography, they were slipping each other\u2019s jeans down and off and he pulled her hard against him, his shorts to her dainties. \u201cGod,\u201d he said. \u201cGod, God, God.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away just enough to shrug out of her shirt and remove her socks. She left the panties for Nate to handle, which he did immediately. \u201cLet me have these,\u201d he said, clutching them in his fist. \u201cLet me keep these for the rest of my life. Can I?\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him and tugged down his boxers. \u201cSure,\u201d she whispered against his lips. \u201cAnd you can keep your underwear.\u201d</p><p>He moaned as if in pain, his hand finding a breast. \u201cWhy are you wearing a bra?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ve been undressing me for five seconds and haven\u2019t gotten to that yet?\u201d she returned. She unsnapped the clasp and it fell apart, just in time for his lips on her breast. He rolled on top of her, probing. \u201cCondom,\u201d she whispered. \u201cCondom, Nate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said. \u201cGot it.\u201d And he leaped out of bed, raced unceremoniously to the master bath, running back to the king-size bed with a packet in his hand, ripping it open as he went. He flopped on the bed and pulled her close. Then he froze. All motion stopped. Their thighs were pressed together, their lips straining toward each other, their hands pulling their bodies closer, and he said, \u201cAnnie? Are you ready for this?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything and he couldn\u2019t see her face in the darkness of the room. She took his hand and captured the foil packet. She pulled his hand down between her legs where his fingers could answer his question.</p> <p>He moved his hand up her inner thigh, opened her legs a bit, caressed her wonderfully wet folds. \u201cAaah,\u201d he said once more against her lips.</p><p>\u201cReady,\u201d she whispered. \u201cReady.\u201d And then she applied the protection.</p><p>\u201cYou know what, Annie?\u201d he said. \u201cComing home to you, making love to you, it feels like the one thing I\u2019ve always been ready for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s not waste any more time,\u201d she said.</p><p>He fell asleep while still inside her, holding her close. Sometime in the night, they roused just enough to make love again. When he awoke in the morning, he was alone. There was a little puppy, whimpering, faint and distant.</p><p>He found her note in the kitchen:Nate\u2014you were so tired, you slept through puppy breakfast, which was noisy. I decided you should sleep. I want you to have the most wonderful time of your life on your trip. I\u2019ll take care of everything while you\u2019re gone and I\u2019ll put away the decorations. And thank you for last night. It was perfect. Love, Annie</p><p>He picked up the note and read it again and again. \u201cIt\u2019s awful hard to leave you, Annie,\u201d he whispered. \u201cEspecially at Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel booked his flights to coordinate with the rest of the group\u2014they were all meeting for breakfast in Miami. From there they would fly together to Nassau. He had to take a commuter from Santa Rosa to San Francisco. That meant a two-hour drive south to pick up the first leg of his trip. From San Francisco he would take a nonstop red-eye to Miami. He would be there in early morning. He\u2019d have breakfast in the airport with his old gang. It brought to mind the breakfasts they\u2019d had together after all-night study sessions, right before a big exam. Then they\u2019d get to the Bahamas early in the day to begin their ten-day vacation.</p><p>He didn\u2019t mind driving, which was a good thing, since his practice had him running around the mountains and valleys of three counties looking after livestock. The drive from Humboldt County to Santa Rosa was beautiful and calm. But rather than enjoy the rolling hills and snow-covered pines and mountains, all he thought about was Annie.</p><p>Before he left Humboldt County, he had called her at her shop. \u201cI\u2019ll be leaving in a couple of hours. Sure you want to let me go without you?\u201d he had asked.</p><p>\u201cThis is your trip, Nate. Not mine,\u201d she said. \u201cYou planned it, you\u2019ve looked forward to it, you paid for it\u2014now go and enjoy it. I have family things to do. And puppy things. When you get back all the decorations will be put away, the puppies will be distributed to their new homes and you\u2019ll be tanned and rested. And it will be a whole new year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear cell reception is terrible there, but I\u2019ll try to call you while I\u2019m gone,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to see if you have any regrets about turning down an all-expense-paid vacation. And there\u2019s a note for you on the kitchen counter\u2014my hotel info. Call me if you need anything. Anything at all.\u201d</p><p>When he said that, he had been thinking, Me. Call if you need me. Call me if you miss me.</p><p>But Annie had laughed cheerfully. \u201cNow, Nate, what are you going to do if I need something? Catch a flight home? You\u2019ll be on the other side of the country! And you\u2019ll be with your friends\u2014a reunion, Nate. Now stop worrying about stuff you can\u2019t do anything about. Just have fun. Besides, I can manage just about anything.\u201d</p><p>A few weeks earlier Nathaniel had been looking forward to this vacation with such enthusiasm. He\u2019d built a few fantasies about girls in bikinis and low-cut sundresses. He saw himself inviting a beautiful woman out to dinner; maybe he\u2019d be taking some lovely young thing sailing. He envisioned staying up late with his buddies, laughing, drinking and smoking cigars. He figured he\u2019d be needed to rub suntan lotion on a bare female back.</p><p>None of those mental images were working for him now. Now all he could think about was how long the next ten days were likely to be. He hoped he\u2019d at least catch an impressive fish or two. That\u2019s what he\u2019d like to take home to her\u2014a big, mounted sailfish. Maybe they\u2019d hang it over the bed and remember their first Christmas. And their last one apart.</p><p>Annie had laughed brightly while on the phone with Nate, but melancholy stole her laughter away the moment she hung up. She supposed it was a combination of being a little bit tired and sad that he\u2019d be away. She\u2019d been up late decorating his house and baking him those awful-tasting cookies; he just didn\u2019t have the right ingredients on hand, and what he had was far from fresh. Of course she hadn\u2019t slept much in his bed; he\u2019d kept her busy. And so satisfied. He was such a wonderful lover, but instead of leaving her sated, it left her wanting more of him.</p><p>And then she had to get up very early\u2014she had to go home, shower and dress for work and arrange the Christmas gift baskets for the girls in the shop.</p><p>She wondered if he had felt her lips press softly against his before she\u2019d left him. Had he heard her say, \u201cGoodbye, Nate. Be safe. Hurry home\u201d? He hadn\u2019t stirred at all.</p><p>She had been happy to hold him close, warm him and put him to sleep. She wouldn\u2019t mind doing that every day for the rest of her life.</p><p>She knew her mood had plummeted and she didn\u2019t want anyone in the shop noticing, so she grabbed up the appointment book and walked to her small office at the back of the little shop. But sure enough, Pam followed her. Pam stood in the doorway, looking at her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Annie. He\u2019ll be thrilled to get home to you,\u201d Pam said.</p><p>\u201cSure. Of course. I didn\u2019t say anything otherwise, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to,\u201d Pam said. \u201cYou laughed and joked with him on the phone, but the second you hung up, you got real sober. Serious. Maybe a little worried.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you think it was a mistake to let him go?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>\u201cThe time will fly by,\u201d Pam said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you like this. You love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love him,\u201d she admitted. Because he was sensitive but also very confident and strong, she thought. He was a sucker for a bunch of puppies even though they were such a pain to take care of. He didn\u2019t even have to think twice about whether to be out till two in the morning because someone had a problem with an animal. The way Annie had been raised, she\u2019d come to accept that people who cared for animals had a special kind of soul, a precious gift. You weren\u2019t likely to get much back from animals except a lick on the hand or maybe a good performance in a competition. And in her family\u2019s case\u2014the animals provided milk and meat, their roof, their very beds and clothes, their land and legacy. She had been raised with deep respect for animals and the physicians who cared for them. Those gifted doctors were men and women who knew the meaning of unconditional love.</p><p>\u201cI love him because he\u2019s tender and strong and smart,\u201d Annie said. She smiled sentimentally. \u201cAnd he\u2019s so cute he makes my knees wobble. But, Pam, I didn\u2019t tell him. I tried to show him, but I didn\u2019t tell him.\u201d</p> <p>Pam chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019ll have your chance very soon.\u201d Pam stepped really close to Annie and made her voice a whisper. \u201cSweetheart, you\u2019re beautiful and smart. And I bet you make his knees wobble, too.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at her friend. \u201cThank you, Pam. That\u2019s sweet. The sweetest part is it wasn\u2019t just a compliment\u2014I know you meant it. Did I tell you he asked me to go with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no. You might\u2019ve failed to mention that. And you weren\u2019t tempted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I was tempted. But it\u2019s his trip and I have family things going on. But after this, if he feels for me what I feel for him, it\u2019s the last time I\u2019m letting him get that far away from me without him knowing how I feel.\u201d</p><p>Pam gave her a fake punch in the arm. \u201cGood plan. I\u2019ve worked with you for five years, Annie, since before you bought the franchise on this little shop. Have you ever been in love before?\u201d</p> <p>Annie let go a huff of laughter. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous\u2014I\u2019m twenty-eight. I\u2019ve been in love plenty of times, starting with Dickie Saunders in the second grade.\u201d</p><p>But never like this, she thought. Nothing even close to this. She wanted to massage his temples when he was stressed or worried, wanted to curl into him and bring him comfort, wanted to trust him with every emotion she had. She\u2019d go into battle for him if he needed that from her, or better still, laugh with him until they both cried. It would feel so good to stand at his side and help him with his work. Or argue with him for a while before making up\u2014she would have to promise never to have PMS again and he would have to pledge not to be such a know-it-all. Green as a bullfrog, he\u2019d called her. She\u2019d never had a man in her life who could see right through her so fast, who could read her mind, feel her feelings.</p><p>Realizing she\u2019d been off in kind of a daze, she refocused and looked at her friend. She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Pam said with a smile.</p><p>Nathaniel was pressed up against the cold window of a packed 747 all the way from San Francisco to Miami. Over five hours of nighttime flying. Three or four times he got up and walked around the dimmed cabin. Normally he could sleep on long flights, but not on this one. When he arrived at his destination at 7:00 a.m. on the morning of Christmas Eve, he had almost an hour before meeting his friends for breakfast in a preselected restaurant in the international terminal.</p><p>By the time he got to the restaurant, Jerry, Ron, Cindy and Tina were there, surrounded by enough luggage to sink a cruise ship. Missing were Bob and Tom and their wives. Jerry spotted Nate first and called, \u201cHey, look who just dragged himself off the red-eye. You look like hell, man,\u201d he said, grinning, sticking out a hand. \u201cGet this man a Bloody Mary!\u201d</p> <p>Nate shook hands, hugged, accepted the drink, complete with lemon wedge and celery stalk, and raised his glass. \u201cGreat to see you guys,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep meeting like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeats not meeting at all.\u201d Jerry looked at his watch. \u201cWe have an hour and a half.\u201d He looked around and frowned. \u201cNathaniel, did you manage to get your luggage checked through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I left it with a skycap.\u201d</p><p>There was some head shaking. \u201cAlways has been one jump ahead of us,\u201d Tina said.</p><p>\u201cThing is\u2014I can\u2019t make it. Sorry, guys.\u201d</p><p>Confused stares answered him. \u201cUm, don\u2019t look now, buddy\u2014but you\u2019re in Miami. Almost at Bahama Mama heaven.\u201d</p><p>Nate chuckled and took a sip of his Bloody Mary. \u201cThis was a good idea,\u201d he said of the drink. \u201cI left my luggage at the airline counter with the skycap. They\u2019re working on a flight for me, but it looks bleak. Who would travel on Christmas Eve on purpose? Why are they booked solid? I\u2019d never travel on Christmas Eve if I didn\u2019t have to, but I told them I\u2019d take anything. I might end up eating my turkey dinner right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell.....?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a woman,\u201d Nate said. He was shaking his head and laughing at himself. \u201cI gotta get back to a woman.\u201d</p><p>Jerry clamped a hand on his shoulder. \u201cOkay, let me guess, you got drunk on the plane.....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just bring her?\u201d Cindy asked.</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t come,\u201d Nate said. \u201cShe had all kinds of family stuff going on and she couldn\u2019t miss it. She\u2019s real close to her family\u2014great family, too. So I said I\u2019d stay home, but she said no to that. She said I should have my vacation. She insisted. And I let her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, bud, keep your head here. Give her a call, tell her you\u2019re miserable without her and you\u2019ll be home soon. Hell, get a flight out in two or three days if you still feel the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d Nate said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be sitting in a bar with you losers if they find a flight for me.\u201d He took another swallow of his drink. He stared at it. \u201cReally, this was a good idea. So was the trip. Anyone game to try this next year? I shouldn\u2019t have any complications next year\u2014that I can think of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathaniel, if she\u2019s the right one, she\u2019s not going anyplace,\u201d Jerry attempted.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s the best part. She\u2019s not going anyplace. But you have no idea how much Christmas means to Annie. She\u2019s like the Christmas fairy.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cListen, I don\u2019t expect you to get this, but as much as I was looking forward to spending a few days with you guys, it hit me on the plane\u2014I\u2019m going to feel alone without her. I\u2019m going to be with the best friends I\u2019ve ever had, and I\u2019m not going to have much fun, because she\u2019s not with me.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI know where I\u2019m supposed to be right now, and I better get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathaniel, this will pass,\u201d Ron said. \u201cHow long have you known this woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, jeez\u2014about three weeks. About three of the best weeks of my life. When you find the right one, you don\u2019t fly away and leave her wondering how you feel. See, Jerry, in case you ever find some brain-damaged female willing to throw her lot in with you, you\u2019ll want to remember this\u2014you better not let her out of your sight and you better not leave her without telling her you love her. Got that?\u201d</p><p>Jerry looked confused. \u201cIsn\u2019t that why they invented florists? Don\u2019t you just dial up a big, expensive batch of flowers and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathaniel, that is so sweet,\u201d Tina said. \u201cI had no idea you were so sweet. Didn\u2019t we date once? Were you ever that sweet to me?\u201d</p><p>With a laugh, Nate put down his drink, grabbed her, hugged her and gave her a kiss on the cheek. He gave his old pal Cindy a hug. He punched Jerry in the arm and gave Ron\u2019s hand a quick shake. \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch. Have a good time on the beach. Thanks for the drink. Tell Bob and Tom I\u2019m sorry I missed them. Merry Christmas.\u201d And he turned and strode away.</p><p>After closing the shop on the twenty-third, Annie had gotten right out to Nate\u2019s house to take care of the puppies. She\u2019d gone back after dinner at the farm to make sure they were fixed for the night and then she\u2019d stayed a while, enjoying her stab at Christmas decorations. Virginia had been good enough to check on the puppies on the morning of the twenty-fourth, as she had to look after the horses anyway.</p><p>Annie had purchased five decorated hat boxes at the craft store, and on Christmas Eve she took one little pup\u2014a female, Vixen\u2014to work with her for Pam. Pam\u2019s mom would keep the puppy safe and warm until Christmas morning. They closed the shop at noon and Annie headed back to Nate\u2019s before going to the farm.</p><p>There was a long-standing tradition on Christmas Eve at the farm\u2014Hank covered a hay wagon with fresh hay, hooked up Annie\u2019s horses and took the kids for a hayride while the women finished dinner. The winter sun was setting early, so they would have their hayride before dinner. The snow had begun to fall, so the wagon would have to stick to the farm roads. Seven kids, their dads and grandpa set out, singing and laughing.</p><p>And in the kitchen, the traditional prime rib was being prepared. In years past, it was their own beef, but now they had to buy it. From the kitchen window, Annie watched the hay wagon pull away from the house. Telling herself not to be moody, she briefly fantasized about sending Nate out with the kids and her dad and brothers. Well, there were years ahead for that.</p><p>Rose came up behind her and slipped her arms around Annie\u2019s waist. \u201cYou can go with them if you want to,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThere is more than enough help in the kitchen. Too much, if you ask me!\u201d</p><p>Annie laughed at her mom. \u201cI\u2019m staying in,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter dinner I have puppies to deliver on behalf of Santa. We\u2019re down to three boys. I think after Christmas, when things are quieter at work, I\u2019ll advertise. And I\u2019ll call the shelters to see if anyone they consider good potential parents are looking for a puppy.\u201d</p><p>Rose used a finger to run Annie\u2019s hair behind her ear. \u201cAre you a little down this year?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to miss him, especially over the holidays,\u201d Rose said. \u201cI like Nathaniel. He seems like a good boy.\u201d</p><p>Boy, Annie thought, amused. She couldn\u2019t tell her mother that he was all man. More man than she\u2019d experienced in her adult life. And she hoped he pestered her as much when he came home as before he left. \u201cLet\u2019s get everything on the table, Mom. They\u2019ll be back and freezing before we know it.\u201d</p><p>Of course the kids didn\u2019t want the hayride to end until they were blue with cold. Hank pulled right up to the back of the house to let the kids off so their mothers could fuss over them, warming them. Then with the help of his sons they unhooked the horses, took them to the barn and brushed and fed them. By the time everyone was inside, the house was bursting with noise and the smells of food, along with the scent of hay and horses. Stories from the ride, punctuated by laughter, filled the house while the meat was carved and dish after dish of delicious food was carried to the tables, then passed around. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The hayride wasn\u2019t meant for pure enjoyment; it was calculated to wear out the kids who might otherwise stay up half the night. After the main course and dessert, the women headed to the kitchen for cleanup and coffee, while Grandpa, Annie\u2019s brothers and the kids got out a variety of board games. That was when Annie took her leave. She had to go back to Nate\u2019s house, gather up her Christmas puppies and make some deliveries.</p><p>Bundled up and on the way to her truck, she wandered around the house to the back. The moon was so high and bright it lit up the farm. The weathered barn in rusty red stood quiet. She remembered when it was teeming with life\u2014cows, horses, goats, chickens, not to mention people. Every single one of the McKenzie kids had had big parties at the farm. Her dad would dig a hole and fill it with hot coals to cook corn; hot dogs would be turned on the grill, and Rose would put out a huge bowl of potato salad and deviled eggs to die for. The kids who came to the farm from town would run wild through the pastures, barn and woods. They\u2019d swing from the rafters of the barn on a rope and fall into a pile of hay, ride the horses, chase the goats. She could remember it like it was yesterday as she looked over the rolling hills and pastureland.</p><p>Someday, she thought, my own children and their friends will play here.</p><p>She climbed up on the hay wagon and lay down in the sweet hay, looking up at the sky. It was clear, black, speckled with stars. At the moment the house was throbbing with noise, but ordinarily it was so quiet in the country you could hear a leaf rustle a hundred yards away.</p> <p>The sound of a car approaching caused her to sit up, and she recognized the Dicksons\u2019 truck, their nearest neighbors. Another country custom\u2014people dropped in on each other, bringing homemade treats and staying for at least a cup of coffee. Of course the McKenzies didn\u2019t go visiting when the family was home\u2014there were too many of them. A second truck trundled along behind the Dicksons\u2019\u2014looked like the whole fam-damn-ly was coming over. She plopped back down on the hay, hoping to be invisible. Once they all got inside, she\u2019d take off. She wasn\u2019t feeling sociable.</p><p>There was only one person she wanted to be with right now. She hugged herself and tried to pretend his arms were\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnnie? You out here?\u201d Beau called from the back porch.</p><p>Don\u2019t answer, she told herself.</p><p>\u201cAnnie!\u201d</p> <p>But her truck was parked out front. \u201cI\u2019m looking at the stars, but I\u2019m leaving in a second. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to know where you are!\u201d he yelled back.</p><p>\u201cWell, go away and leave me alone! You\u2019re scaring the stars!\u201d And then more quietly she muttered, \u201cPest.\u201d</p><p>Seconds later she felt the wagon move, heard it squeak and a large body flopped down next to her in the hay.</p><p>\u201cAw, Beau, you jerk!\u201d she nearly yelled. She sat straight up, plucked straw out of her hair with a gloved hand and looked at the body next to her. Not Beau. Nathaniel lay facedown in the hay beside her. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked in confusion.</p><p>He turned his head to one side. \u201cI came back to sweep you off your feet, but I\u2019ve been either flying or driving or hanging around airports so long that I\u2019m too tired to roll over, much less sweep you anywhere. And I didn\u2019t get much sleep the night before I left, either.\u201d He grinned. \u201cThank you very much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t go?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI went. I made it all the way to Miami.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd came back?\u201d</p><p>He yawned hugely. \u201cI realized halfway there that I couldn\u2019t go to the Bahamas without you, but they wouldn\u2019t turn the plane around.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a second. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat have you done to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this is my fault? That you\u2019re a lunatic?\u201d</p><p>He yawned again. \u201cI was normal until three weeks ago,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how many people fly on Christmas Eve. I couldn\u2019t get a nonstop. I was up and down all day. I had to go from Miami to Lansing to Seattle to San Francisco. The last leg\u2014I had to ride in the bathroom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou did not,\u201d she said with a laugh. She lay down in the hay beside him.</p><p>\u201cThen I had to rent a car and drive to Santa Rosa to get my truck. Then drive home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Beau called from the back porch. \u201cYou guys want the horses hitched up?\u201d</p><p>Annie sat up again. \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d she yelled back. \u201cCan you please go away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys making out in the hay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away!\u201d they both yelled.</p><p>\u201cJeez.\u201d The back door slammed.</p><p>Annie lay back down. \u201cNow, what do you have in mind?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI had a plan,\u201d he said. \u201cI was going to tell you I love you, then seduce you, put a really nice flush on your cheeks, but I\u2019m not sure I have the strength. I do love you, however. And a little sleep tonight might give me a second wind, so brace yourself.\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cI have puppies to deliver,\u201d she informed him.</p><p>\u201cAw, you haven\u2019t done that already? I was so hoping we could just go home and go to bed......\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I take you home to your house, then you can sleep and I\u2019ll deliver the puppies. I don\u2019t think you should be driving if you can\u2019t roll over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said, facedown in the hay. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. Any second now I\u2019ll perk right up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love me?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat makes you think so?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t roll over, but he looped an arm over her waist and pulled her closer. \u201cYou are so under my skin, Annie McKenzie, I\u2019ll never be a free man again. Pretty soon now you\u2019ll probably want to say you love me, too. Hurry up, will you? I\u2019d like to be conscious for it.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him.</p><p>\u201cSay it, damn it,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you came back in the same day. Why didn\u2019t you just call? Or come back and tell me you had a miserable time? You could have had your vacation and then told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, Annie\u2014I realized if I stayed away from you, I\u2019d be lonely. No matter how many people were around, I\u2019d feel alone if I wasn\u2019t with you.\u201d He pulled her closer. \u201cI wanted you to know how important it was to me, to be with you. I wanted you to know you were worth a lot of trouble. You aren\u2019t something I can put off till later. You\u2019re not the kind of woman I can send flowers to with a note to say how I feel\u2014you have to be in my arms. I\u2019m not looking for the easy way with you, Annie. I want the forever way. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to ever change. Now can we please deliver the puppies and get some sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, running her fingers through the short hair over his ear. \u201cMerry Christmas, Nathaniel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, baby. I brought you something. A diamond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou brought me a diamond?\u201d she asked, stunned.</p><p>He dug in his pocket and pulled out a plastic diamond about the size of a lime, attached to a key chain. \u201cOur first Christmas Eve together, and I shopped for your present in an airport gift shop. By the way, when I get the real diamond, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be this big.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and kissed him. \u201cYou will never know how much I like this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna show me?\u201d he asked, hugging her tight.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she promised. \u201cFor the next fifty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorks for me, Annie. I love you like mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make my knees wobble,\u201d she said. \u201cLet me take you home so you can start wobbling them some more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d He kissed her with surprising passion for a man dead on his feet. \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
