Movie stars are believed to spring fully formed into apartment-acquiring adulthood. Older girls are the worst offenders when it comes to these expectations of independence, and the one leaning against me now is no different.</p> <p>Her question is whispered in response to me shushing her as I\u2019m trying to fit the key in the lock and get the two of us into the house and into my room without any interference. Now she\u2019s giggling, both hands over her mouth, muffling the sound\u2014though maybe I can\u2019t hear her because my ears are still ringing from the concert in which she was on stage with an electric bass in her skilled hands while I watched from the VIP section.</p><p>I squint at her, because I\u2019m swaying and she\u2019s swaying and our movements are not synchronized. \u201cI said I was turning eighteen tonight, not thirty. Where do you expect me to live?\u201d There\u2019s no rancor behind the slurred words, and luckily she seems to deduce as much from my tone.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, Jesus. I forgot what a baby you are.\u201d</p><p>I arch a brow at her as the key slips into the dead bolt with a metallic scrape. \u201cNope. Tonight, I\u2019m a man. Remember?\u201d I won\u2019t bother to tell her that other girls her age didn\u2019t wait until I was a legal adult; I prefer to let her assume she has something to teach me. Who knows, maybe she does. I turn the key until the lock clacks, depress the lever and push a shoulder against the door. We\u2019re in. Putting a finger to my puckered lips, I repeat, \u201cShhh,\u201d while I wrestle the key from the door.</p><p>This time, she nods, swaying closer with a wicked smile, inclining against me while I grab the door frame for support. Her makeup is smeared and she smells like stale cigarettes and beer\u2014but so do I. \u201cI remember.\u201d Her voice is raspy, like the teeth of the key against the lock.</p> <p>Alcohol-induced dreams are always weird and crude\u2014and I mean that in the best possible way. Then comes the unfortunate act of waking up. By that point, the buzz is long gone, inhibitions are flooding back, and the only thing hammered is the inside of my skull. Add an outside stimulus like, say, a ringing cell set on level wake-the-fuck-up, and I\u2019m propelled to the opposite of a pleasant stage of inebriation. Suddenly a brain-rototilling free-for-all is taking place in an enclosed space, right behind my eyeballs. Welcome to hangoverland.</p><p>I click talk to make the screaming stop (I like this song? Really?), but don\u2019t bother trying to answer, because my mouth is a desert and speech is improbable. There\u2019s a water bottle on the bedside table, but when I stretch to grab it, I drop the phone, which emits the barely audible voice of my manager, George. \u201cHello? Reid? Hell-o-o?\u201d</p><p>Shit. Swiping the phone from the floor, I nearly fall off the bed. \u201c\u2019Lo?\u201d My voice sounds and tastes like it\u2019s flowing through gravel.</p><p>\u201cRough night?\u201d George is sarcastic, but not callously so. He\u2019s my manager, not my parent. I assume he\u2019s grateful to the universe, fate, God, whatever/whoever\u2019s in charge for that. I\u2019m a better client than I am a son. Just ask my dad.</p><p>I lift my head a fraction, to see if that hot little bass guitarist from the band John and I saw last night is still here. I vaguely remember her stumbling around my room with me, giggling like she was thirteen instead of the twenty-whatever she said she was. She\u2019s nowhere, but a barely legible note is under my water bottle, the ring around the bottom splotching the ink. I take a generous gulp from the bottle and check it out: Reid\u2014awesome night. More please? I put my number in your phone\u2014Cassandra</p><p>Cassandra. Did she ever say her name last night? I can\u2019t remember.</p> <p>\u201cReid?\u201d George\u2019s voice. Crap.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I lurch to a seated position on the side of the bed, my head in one hand and the phone in the other, trying to decide if I need to throw up or not. Verdict: possibly.</p><p>\u201cRichter just called\u2014you got the part in School Pride. He said he\u2019s looking forward to working with you.\u201d Adam Richter is one of Hollywood\u2019s leading directors. The man is a legend with an eye for teen dramas. \u201cYou\u2019re scheduled to do a two-minute spot on ET tomorrow, by the way, so rest up. Also, Richter wants you in on auditions for the Lizbeth role. Those will start in a couple of weeks. We\u2019ll discuss all of this on Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d God, my head feels like it\u2019s going to fall off. \u201cWhat\u2019s the location?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve decided to film in Austin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTexas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast time I checked, yes, that\u2019s where Austin is located.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeehaw.\u201d</p> <p>School Pride, ET, auditions, Austin. Christ, my head is splitting. Why don\u2019t I ever remember that mornings like this are the predictable conclusion of nights like last night?</p><p>Emma</p><p>My father ladles Alfredo sauce over bowls of linguini while I set the table for three. \u201cDan called this afternoon,\u201d he says. Dan is my agent, and this is my cue to brace for a new audition. What this time\u2014a tampon commercial? Another side role in a Lifetime movie? \u201cHe got you an audition for the lead role in a wide-release film. How would you like to play\u2014\u201d his hands move into frame-the-shot mode \u201c\u2014Elizabeth Bennet?\u201d</p><p>I frown. \u201cAnother remake? But they just did a Pride and Prejudice adaptation a few years ago.\u201d Then there\u2019s my rusty (and honestly, sort of abysmal) British accent.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing\u2014this isn\u2019t nineteenth century England. It\u2019s a modern version, set in a suburban American high school.\u201d He waits for my enthusiasm, but all I can think is: Yay! A cute role in a corrupted version of one of my favorite novels ever.</p><p>Before I can stop myself, I go one better than a simple lack of enthusiasm. \u201cPride and Prejudice. Set in a high school. Seriously?\u201d</p><p>He sighs and tosses the script packet on the kitchen table, and we don\u2019t discuss it further. This is our standard resolution to this sort of conflict: we both pretend I\u2019m all good with what he wants. In this particular instance, I\u2019ll take the packet to my room and start memorizing lines, and he\u2019ll tell Dan how psyched I am about the audition.</p><p>Landing this role would be career-altering, no doubt about it. All the bit parts, the commercials for department stores and bacon and grape juice have led up to this moment... where I try to win another (more prominent than anything before) girl-next-door role. Truth is, I\u2019m not just tired of one-dimensional roles. I\u2019m sick of doing films, period.</p><p>When I was thirteen, I was one of the fairies in a local stage production of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. I loved the live performance, the thrill of the audience reaction. I\u2019ve pleaded to do more live theatre in the four years since, but it\u2019s never going to happen, because Dan and my manager-father consider my role in Midsummer a one-time community service project. They want Emma Pierce to be a household name, so there\u2019s no time for silly local theatre roles.</p><p>As a compromise, I\u2019ve tried suggesting quirky, edgy independent film scripts. Every time, they shoot me down. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is what we want for your career,\u201d one of them says, and I fold up and cave, because when it comes to running my own life, I\u2019m a yellow-bellied coward.</p><p>Just this morning, I felt like a regular girl\u2014scanning my computer and phone for overnight messages, planning a trip to the mall with Emily. A day of typical spring break activities with my best friend was exactly what I needed to make me feel normal. We rolled down the windows, sang along to our favorite songs, talked about boys we know, and speculated about the ones we haven\u2019t met.</p><p>I\u2019m not a regular girl, though. I\u2019m a working actress. I don\u2019t attend school; I have tutors. I don\u2019t hang in the commons at lunch with my friends; I grab something from the caterer on set if I\u2019m filming, or make myself something in the kitchen at home if not. I read scripts and review lines while exercising, do homework on set.</p><p>In the past year, my relationship with my father has grown more strained than ever, but it hasn\u2019t been great for years. I inherited little from him apart from his gray-green eyes and a passion for running. In every other respect, we\u2019re polar opposites. He doesn\u2019t get me. I don\u2019t get him. End of story.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>REID</p><p>\u201cYour father says he\u2019ll be home tonight. Please, Reid?\u201d</p><p>Shit. \u201cYeah, sure, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Dinner with Mark and Lucy\u2014always entertaining. I avoid it when possible, but Mom\u2019s got me cornered before I leave for my meeting with Larry, my PR guy. She\u2019s so persistently anxious that it\u2019s hard for me to say no to her. Dad doesn\u2019t seem to have the same struggle. She\u2019s got this idealistic vision of the three of us as a happy little family: if we sit down together at the dinner table, domestic bliss will magically occur. Why this doesn\u2019t strike her as wishful thinking given the fact that it\u2019s never worked before, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll be gone soon anyway. I refuse to contemplate how far she\u2019ll sink then.</p><p>I haven\u2019t decided when I\u2019ll actually move out. My room has a separate entrance and is more like an apartment attached to my parents\u2019 house than a room within it. My grandmother lived with us until she died a few years ago, and this was her suite. Not long after she was gone, I talked Mom into letting me switch rooms. Dad was pissed because I was like fifteen and could then come and go without their knowledge, but it was a done deal by the time he noticed, and I just entrenched and ignored him until he quit blustering.</p><p>\u201cCongrats on getting School Pride, man.\u201d Larry\u2019s toadying, as usual. We\u2019re at a sushi place on Ventura, and he\u2019s annoying the crap out of me. He can\u2019t even use chopsticks correctly\u2014it\u2019s like his hands are retarded. That may sound like a pretentious prick thing to say, but he chose the place. Plus, my gut says he\u2019s bitter about what I make compared to him. There\u2019s a lot of envy in this business. The more successful you are, the larger the target.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I pop a piece of salmon sashimi into my mouth.</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cOkay, so, well...\u201d Shit, man, spit it out already. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking that you should, uh, align yourself with some charitable efforts, now that you\u2019re an adult.\u201d He has this look like I\u2019m going to have a problem with that, which makes me wonder if I should have a problem with it.</p><p>I eye him, still chewing. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>I swear to God he squirms in his seat like a kid on the verge of peeing his pants. \u201cWell, lots of options. Telethons, or, uh, a day or two of something like Habitat for Humanity, or you could endorse adult literacy or childhood vaccinations with a television spot.\u201d</p><p>I forgot about Larry\u2019s tendency to well and uh when nervous. It makes me want to shovel sushi into his mouth until he can\u2019t speak at all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing some telethon, or manual labor. And childhood vaccinations?\u201d I quirk an eyebrow. \u201cShouldn\u2019t that be left to people with kids?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He mops his face with his napkin. \u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>This is going to take all damned day. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>He pokes at his tuna slices. \u201cYou could visit schools, participate in drug and alcohol awareness presentations\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no.\u201d The irony would be too hilarious, but I\u2019m not doing it. It would be like those teen celebs who pretend virginity, wearing chastity rings and preaching abstinence to other teens, only to get caught with their pants down at some point. Literally. I get enough close scrutiny from the press without daring them to catch me plastered or high.</p> <p>\u201cWell... uh, you could just donate cash\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go with that. Check with my dad, he\u2019ll handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a cause in mind?\u201d</p><p>I look at him blankly. The only cause I believe in is my own. Chicks like animals, right? \u201cSomething with animals.\u201d Stipulation: the cuter the better. \u201cBut no crazy activist groups. And domesticated animals\u2014not some endangered salamander or shit like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh-okay, well... domesticated animals\u2014like the SPCA?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d SPCA. Something-something-something-animals.</p><p>Emma</p><p>I\u2019m removing my dinner of reheated leftovers from the microwave when my cell plays Emily\u2019s ringtone. She doesn\u2019t wait for hello. \u201cTurn on channel ten!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, just a minute\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Now!\u201d</p><p>I head obediently for the television. \u201cKeep your shorts on, I\u2019m going. What\u2019s on?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s on, you mean.\u201d</p><p>I key in the channel on the remote and the screen erupts in flashing images and the familiar theme music of Entertainment Tonight. \u201c...and he\u2019s here tonight to talk to us about a new project in the works,\u201d the host says as the 52-inch screen catches up with the surround sound system.</p><p>The camera cuts to Reid Alexander, the hottest guy on film. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m really psyched about it.\u201d He swings his dark blond hair out of his eyes and smiles that trademark smile: a little shy, sorta humble, totally hot.</p><p>\u201cOh. My. God,\u201d Emily breathes.</p><p>Reid Alexander is flat out eye candy: dark blue eyes and facial features bordering on pretty\u2014long, dark eyelashes, almost pouty mouth\u2014but the lines of his face are all male. His hair is perpetually disheveled, but it\u2019s a flawless sort of mess. He doesn\u2019t seem real; he\u2019s like an artist\u2019s interpretation of an eighteen-year old sex god.</p><p>\u201cWe hear the film is going to be an adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s classic novel, Pride and Prejudice?\u201d The host holds the microphone under his chin.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah. It\u2019s set in an American high school, so it\u2019ll be different. Fresh, you know? I\u2019ll be working with Adam Richter, which I\u2019m really excited about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma!\u201d I feel Emily\u2019s elation through the phone. \u201cThis is your movie, right? I saw the blurb and I thought holy shit that\u2019s Emma\u2019s movie!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d I can\u2019t reply coherently yet. Reid Alexander is playing Will Darcy in a film adaptation I wasn\u2019t all that jazzed about auditioning for twenty-four hours ago.</p><p>\u201cThe question everyone wants answered: who is your leading lady going to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re running auditions in a couple of weeks, so hopefully I\u2019ll know the answer to that real soon.\u201d Another killer smile.</p><p>The host turns to the camera. \u201cYou heard it here, folks. Reid Alexander to play Will Darcy opposite a lucky as-yet-unnamed costar as Lizbeth Bennet. Who will it be? We\u2019ll keep you posted! Filming should start late summer.\u201d</p><p>I click the TV off and slump onto the sofa.</p><p>\u201cEmma, this is destiny. It\u2019s going to be you. Reid Alexander is Darcy and you\u2019re going to be Elizabeth Bennet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lizbeth,\u201d I say. \u201cThey changed the names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Emily is full of her usual confidence on my behalf. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be her.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m exhausted from poring over audition sides until 2 a.m. Coffee aroma drifts up from the kitchen, and I shuffle towards it single-mindedly, a zombie who craves caffeine instead of brains, until I hear Chloe, my stepmother, talking to my father in the kitchen. Reluctant to encounter either of them this early, especially if they\u2019re feeling slighted over my lukewarm reaction to the audition news, I hesitate at the top of the staircase.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll come around. She always does. What\u2019s she going to do? Manage her own career?\u201d I stiffen at Chloe\u2019s sarcastic tone.</p><p>My father is less mocking, more exasperated. \u201cThis could be her ticket out of bit parts and commercials. They\u2019ve already cast Reid Alexander for the lead. Dan says that kid hardly has to audition. If he wants a particular role, he\u2019s almost guaranteed to get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlus he\u2019s yummy hot.\u201d How can Chloe say things like this when Reid Alexander is disgustingly close to the age of the geography students she teaches? You\u2019d think she\u2019d draw a personal line. Gross.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what she wants,\u201d he says. If I rent a billboard or hire a freaking skywriter, might he comprehend what I say I want?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll come around,\u201d Chloe says. \u201cWhen she\u2019s rich and famous, she\u2019ll get decent work instead of chasing down whatever crappy roles she can get. Though it would be a stretch to call what she does working.\u201d I grip the banister, waiting for him to say something in my defense.</p><p>\u201cHumph,\u201d he says, marching out the door to work. Chloe parks it in front of Good Morning America, because unfortunately spring break applies to teachers, too. Usually, I couldn\u2019t care less about her opinion, as annoying as it is to listen to it at early-o\u2019clock in the morning. Not even coffee can induce me to go down there now.</p><p>My father was there when I did my first commercial\u2014nineteen takes to get the precise sip of juice that wouldn\u2019t inhibit my two lines about how delicious and wholesome it was. I still can\u2019t look at grape juice without gagging. He was there when the maniacal director of a low-budget made-for-tv movie screamed in my face because I dropped a prop phone. He watched as I sweltered through Arizona desert heat with a parka zipped to my chin, portraying the daughter of an intergalactic explorer who\u2019d been exiled to a dry, frozen planet.</p><p>I thought he was clear on how hard I work, at least.</p><p>Don\u2019t misunderstand\u2014I love what I do. And I\u2019m good at it. Some people assume acting is just putting on someone else\u2019s clothes or accent, but that\u2019s not enough. You have to unzip the character\u2019s skin, step into her completely, allow yourself to meld with her. You have to become the character. Even if the character is a kid who really likes juice.</p><p>I should be grateful, I should feel lucky, and I am, I do. But even if you have what everyone else wants\u2014if it isn\u2019t what you want, it isn\u2019t what you want. A high school film version of one of the greatest novels of all time? Really? Unless Jane Austen is a Reid Alexander fan, she\u2019s probably spinning in her grave.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>REID</p><p>These auditions are killing me. They did screen tests on I don\u2019t even know how many girls, and narrowed it down to twenty. Richter wants her to be attractive, but not exceptionally hot, which blows, but he\u2019s right. Lizbeth Bennet is someone Will Darcy falls for against his normal inclinations.</p><p>I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m capable of having onscreen chemistry with anyone, but sadly, that isn\u2019t the case. Before each girl comes in, we go over her headshots, clips of past film work, and her screen test. I\u2019ve done auditions with eleven of them so far, and I\u2019m thinking these are the ones we narrowed down to? We\u2019ve spent varying amounts of time on each one, and I\u2019m trying to figure out how Richter operates, because we\u2019re spending longer with the ones I want to cut. Not that I\u2019m complaining to Adam Richter about whatever method he uses or who he chooses.</p><p>\u201cDaria,\u201d Richter calls to his assistant, his finger on the clipboard of information in his hand. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for the next girl. Belinda, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Daria says. \u201cI\u2019ll bring her right in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kiss this one, aren\u2019t I?\u201d I say.</p><p>Richter barks a laugh and his bright blue eyes regard me over his glasses. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>Oops. \u201cUm. It just seems the less jazzed I am about one, the more likely we are to do the kiss.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows\u2014equal parts black and silver\u2014rise slightly. \u201cGood observation. I don\u2019t want to miss out on possible physical chemistry, so the ones who aren\u2019t passing the test on script audition get one final chance before we reject them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I appreciate your support.\u201d His mouth twists, and he laughs again when I color slightly, which I never do.</p><p>\u201cAdam, this is Belinda Jarvis.\u201d Daria leaves the girl standing in the center of the camera equipment.</p><p>I can tell right away that Belinda isn\u2019t the one. Her face is too sensual, her expression too calculating. She could, perhaps, be Caroline Bingley. Reciting lines I know so well that I could deliver them while juggling, I read her body language and the way her half-lidded eyes gaze at me and decide that Belinda would be fun to have on set. We get to the kiss, and not two seconds into it, her tongue is in my mouth. Entertaining, yeah. Lizbeth Bennet, no. When she\u2019s dismissed, I mention what I think to Richter, about using her for Caroline.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already chosen Caroline and Charlie,\u201d he says. \u201cWe ran their auditions concurrently, since their sibling chemistry and appearances must be convincing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope to be able to let you know Charlie by tomorrow. I\u2019m calling him tonight. As for Caroline, she\u2019ll be played by Brooke Cameron.\u201d</p><p>Brooke Cameron. I try not to react, but Richter\u2019s eyes miss nothing and I\u2019m too knocked off center to hide my reaction. \u201cYou two worked on something together before, I think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I do not want to go into detail. \u201cA few years ago.\u201d Almost four years ago, in fact.</p><p>He looks as though he has a follow-up question, but Daria pushes the door open and leans in. \u201cEmma Pierce is here, Adam.\u201d</p><p>Emma</p><p>I\u2019m as intimidated auditioning for Adam Richter as I am auditioning with Reid Alexander. Dan warned me that Richter wouldn\u2019t waste time on small talk, so I have to swallow my anxiety and convince him that I\u2019m his ideal Lizbeth Bennet. (I called Emily for moral support but wasn\u2019t helped by, \u201cOh. My. God. The thought of being that close to him. I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d)</p><p>\u201cAll right Reid, Emma, begin with \u2018There you are,\u2019\u201d Richter says. \u201cAnd... action.\u201d</p><p>INT.

I\u2019ll pick you up at eight.</p><p>LIZBETH looks up at him, tilting head as if confused:</p><p>LIZBETH</p> <p>Usually if I\u2019m not interested in going out with someone, I try to be nice about it. But I\u2019m sort of in shock right now.</p><p>WILL</p><p>(incredulous)</p><p>Are you saying no?</p><p>LIZBETH</p> <p>I\u2019m saying you couldn\u2019t pay me.</p><p>(Again, this feels dead wrong, but it\u2019s in the script.)</p><p>WILL glares at LIZBETH, steps closer to her:</p><p>WILL</p><p>What the hell? You\u2019re actually saying no?</p><p>LIZBETH, squaring shoulders:</p> <p>LIZBETH</p><p>So you think you can ask me out and I\u2019ll trot after you like every other idiotic girl in this school? I won\u2019t. Even if you weren\u2019t so rude every time I\u2019m around you, do you think I want anything to do with you after what you did to Jane? And to George?</p><p>WILL</p><p>What happened between George Wickham and me is none of your business. This is ridiculous. I only wanted to take you to a party, even if you aren\u2019t exactly in my league. Would you rather I just lied about that, to save your precious ego?</p><p>LIZBETH</p><p>I couldn\u2019t care less how you asked.</p><p>(We\u2019re inches apart. Reid waits for my one-word line\u2014his cue to kiss me. Up close, Reid Alexander is the most beautiful guy I\u2019ve ever seen, though it\u2019s hardly the best time to appreciate this fact, as Lizbeth is currently livid.)</p><p>What?</p> <p>WILL grabs LIZBETH\u2019S shoulders.</p><p>\u201cCut!\u201d Richter calls. \u201cGood, good. Thank you, Emma. We\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d He dismisses me with a smile.</p><p>Good smile or bad smile? The audition felt good, but he stopped us right before the kiss, which seems not good. \u201cReid, let\u2019s take a look at the next to last line...\u201d he says, and Reid jogs over to consult with him after giving me a mesmerizing smile of his own.</p><p>\u201cMs. Pierce?\u201d The scene attendant breaks my trance, her expression telling me that she witnesses the stupefied look on my face all too often. \u201cRight this way,\u201d she says, showing me to the exit.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>REID</p><p>Lucky number thirteen\u2014Emma Pierce. We\u2019ll see two more girls today and five tomorrow, but I already know it\u2019s her. That spark, the chemistry\u2014we\u2019ve got it. The source of it is inexplicable; it\u2019s more than and many times separate from simple attraction. There are couples who have it onscreen but can\u2019t stand the sight of each other in real life, and couples where sexual orientation should negate it, but there it is, on film. Like magic.</p><p>I\u2019ve never heard of this girl before. If chosen, she\u2019ll be a virtual unknown, and I wonder if Richter will have problems convincing production to take a chance on her. We auditioned two prominent actresses for Lizbeth on the first day. Either of them would work... but not like Emma. Richter knows it, too. After her audition, he asked me what I thought.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, smiling.</p><p>He smiled back. \u201cI think \u2018yeah\u2019 sums it up nicely. Let\u2019s see these last... seven, is it? But I\u2019ll go ahead and give Emma\u2019s agent a call tomorrow, and get her set up for a callback. Let\u2019s see what you two can do with the entire scene.\u201d</p><p>He wants to see the kiss.</p><p>So do I.</p><p>Emma</p><p>My father and Chloe keep eyeing each other with sideways glances; he sighs noisily every couple of minutes while she chews her lip. Neither has asked me anything since their initial How\u2019d it go? probes, which I answered briefly and with no specifics. They deserve the silent treatment for that speech over the breakfast table a couple of weeks ago, even if they don\u2019t know I was listening.</p><p>\u201cSo... Reid was there?\u201d Chloe prompts, following a full five-minute silence in the taxi after dinner.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I hope they\u2019ll take my attitude as typical seventeen-year-old reticence.</p><p>She waits another minute for me to elaborate, then realizes I\u2019m not going to. \u201cSo, is he gorgeous in person? Was the scene with him or was he just, you know, there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith him.\u201d The hotel finally comes into sight, thank God. Soon we\u2019ll go to our separate, adjoining rooms and I\u2019ll have my thoughts to myself.</p><p>My father heaves another perturbed sigh. \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll get a callback?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Chloe rolls her eyes and pulls out a compact mirror and lipstick, as though her exit at the curb of the hotel is a red-carpet event. Hopefully that ends the interrogation for tonight, though I\u2019m positive it will start up again over breakfast.</p><p>In my bag are the School Pride sides I was expected to memorize for the audition, and the copy of Pride and Prejudice that belonged to my mother, who died when I was six. What my mother bequeathed to me: cloudy memories of our lives before she was gone, a handful of photos, her wedding band, and dog-eared copy of her favorite novel. On page 100, there\u2019s a faint coffee ring. On page 237, a smudged fingerprint, undoubtedly pressed to the page while she was simultaneously cooking and reading to me, something I vaguely recall her doing. When I feel the absence of her the most, when I crave her arms around me and can\u2019t bear the knowledge that she\u2019s never coming back no matter what I do or how much I need her, I open her book to these pages, touch my fingers to the fingerprint and the coffee ring, and feel comforted.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to discuss the audition with anyone but Emily. We\u2019ve been known as Em and Em since kindergarten, when we became best friends, and attended school together until sixth grade, when my father put me into tutoring, citing my erratic schedule. Thanks to my grandmother and Emily\u2019s mom taxiing us back and forth, we stayed close. I don\u2019t know what my life would have been like without her. Lonely, I think.</p><p>With Emily, I got my ears pierced and spied on cute neighborhood boys (armed with her dad\u2019s binoculars), learned to skateboard (sort of) and took driver\u2019s ed. With Emily, I have sleepovers, get pedicures and talk about everything. With Emily, I feel normal.</p><p>I call her as soon as I\u2019m in my room, and she answers on the first ring. \u201cSo which scene did you do? Was it a good one? Did you nail it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe scene where he asks me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one where he kisses you at the end? Aaaaaand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we got to the part where he grabs me, which by the way isn\u2019t something Darcy would ever do, because he\u2019s fully in charge of his emotions at all times\u2014it\u2019s his defining characteristic! I don\u2019t think the screenwriter even read the novel...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma, you\u2019re killing me. I\u2019m dying. Spill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kiss. The director stopped us right before, and I guess they brought the next hopeful contender in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, crap. No fair.\u201d She sighs, taking the loss personally.</p><p>\u201cYeah, kissing him would\u2019ve been a nice consolation prize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma, I told you, you\u2019re getting this part. Are you ready to handle all the screwed up stuff in the script? Movies are never as good as the book, no offense. You can\u2019t let it drive you insane.\u201d Emily knows me so well.</p><p>\u201cI can do it. I\u2019m just worried that if I do this movie, I\u2019ll be stereotyped as insubstantial and cute. I\u2019ll never end up doing something significant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt some point you\u2019ll be in charge of your career, and you can do whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will that be?\u201d I can\u2019t help the whine that seeps into my voice.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re like forty,\u201d she answers. \u201cNo doubt about it\u2014by forty, you\u2019ll be in complete control.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cNight, Em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, Em.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>REID</p><p>After the last two auditions, I\u2019m waiting for my car to be brought around and pulling my phone from my pocket to call my friend John when I get a text from Mom reminding me about dinner at 8:00. My first thought is how the hell to get out of it, but then I remember how she looked this morning when I said yes. I hit reply and type yep.</p><p>The valet zooms up in my Lotus, which I convinced Dad to let me buy a few months ago by telling him I would just get it when I turned eighteen if he said no. He hates the car, from the engine roar when I gun it to the stereo vibrating everything in the house as I pull into the garage, but above all, he hates the color\u2014lemon yellow. He calls it a douche taxi. Last week I pulled into the drive when he was getting the mail, and as I walked up to the house he stared at the car and said, no inflection, \u201cYou\u2019re keeping that thing at least a year.\u201d</p><p>As he knew it would, that remark made me want to sell the fucking car immediately.</p><p>Dinner in two hours should be all kinds of enjoyable.</p><p>I might as well do some shopping\u2014no sense in being home early. Rodeo Drive is closing down for the day, but I head over to Robertson and hand over the keys to another valet, wondering if valets actually drive my car as much or more than I do. Paul &amp; Joe is open and nearly deserted, the sales clerks (both hot\u2014gay guy, wispy blonde chick) hovering, waiting to be helpful. They exchange a look as I browse. Between the two of them, they probably generate interest from anyone between fifteen and fifty who walks through the door.</p><p>I grab a few funky shirts and a pair of jeans and request a dressing room from the girl. \u201cYes, of course, Mr. Alexander,\u201d she says. Maybe someday I\u2019ll hate it, but for now, I love being recognized. I\u2019ve just pulled on the jeans when she comes into the dressing room with another pair in a different shade. Without a trace of apprehension at walking in on me half-undressed, she holds them out. \u201cThis is the newer wash. I thought you might want to try them, too.\u201d I toss them onto the pile as her eyes rake over my chest. Turning to the mirror like I don\u2019t notice, I button the jeans and pull on one of the vintage t-shirts.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Too dug-it-outta-Dad\u2019s-closet?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth turns up on one side and she shrugs. \u201cIf your dad was cool, then that\u2019s in.\u201d She bites her lip, lightly. \u201cLet me see the other one.\u201d</p><p>I pull the shirt off and step closer. \u201cHold it for me?\u201d I can almost hear the porn soundtrack starting up in my head, until my phone beeps\u2014another reminder text from Mom about dinner. I reply that I\u2019m on my way.</p><p>\u201cSo, Kaci,\u201d I touch the nametag just over her breast, \u201cI\u2019ll take both shirts, and the jeans I\u2019m wearing. I don\u2019t have time to take them off right now.\u201d My meaning is clear as I rip the tag off and hand it to her. \u201cI\u2019ll just wear them out, if that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>When I leave, the discarded tag, her phone number written on the back in red ink, is in the bag with the new shirts and the jeans I was wearing when I came in.</p><p>I park next to Dad\u2019s empty spot in the garage. Not a good sign; I hope he\u2019s just late. As much as I\u2019d prefer to pass on sitting across the table from him, I live in constant dread of having to watch the effect on Mom whenever he bails on her\u2014which is often. Immaculada is perched on a stool in the kitchen, chin propped in her hand, watching reality TV. Everything on the stove is set to low. Waiting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m afraid to ask, but I do. \u201cMom in her room?\u201d</p><p>Her head inclines towards the master suite. \u201cS\u00ed, in her room.\u201d Shit. I can tell by her tone what that means.</p><p>The sitting room off the master bedroom gives the impression of a cozy personal library, which is accurate, I suppose. Mom loves to read, or did at one time. The floor-to-ceiling shelves house an enviable selection of books and very few knickknacks or framed photos. I drop into one of two plush leather chairs; she sits in the other, an open book on her lap, an empty martini glass in her hand, her eyes unfocused on the darkened window.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d I don\u2019t have to actually ask the question.</p> <p>She looks at me, blinks likes she\u2019s waking up. \u201cHe\u2019s not coming.\u201d The tears are in her voice, even if they aren\u2019t on her face.</p><p>\u201cGot held up with a case, I guess.\u201d The words are sour in my mouth and I don\u2019t even know why I said them. If his absences and last-minute cancellations were infrequent, his recurrent justifications would work. But they aren\u2019t, and they don\u2019t. \u201cCome on\u2014Immaculada has everything ready. We can enjoy it without him.\u201d I try to keep the bitterness out of my tone, but fail.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really... I\u2019m not really hungry,\u201d she says, and I want to shake her. How can his behavior possibly surprise her now? This is his demeanor towards both of us, and has been forever. I don\u2019t get it, but I don\u2019t give a shit anymore, and she shouldn\u2019t, either.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I stand up, hands in pockets, unable to fix this for the millionth time. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll go ahead and meet John. I\u2019ll tell Immaculada to pack up the food; maybe you\u2019ll be hungry later.\u201d She won\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s a good idea. Thank you, Reid.\u201d</p> <p>I breathe a sigh. When she says my name, it drains the anger\u2014at her, anyway\u2014like she\u2019s pulled a plug. I lean down and kiss her before I leave, pretending not to hear when I get into the hallway and she says, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Emma</p><p>When Chloe tags along for auditions, she insists on a five-star hotel, as though I\u2019m already a big star. No penthouse suite, yet, but I\u2019m sure she has plans.</p><p>I\u2019m the first one down to breakfast. The waitress brings my coffee with cream in a tiny crystal pitcher and little straws of raw sugar in a matching crystal box. My omelet is created to order and served on toile-embossed china. If I land this part and achieve the fame and fortune my father wants for me, this could be my life. All the time.</p><p>Just outside the restaurant window, a blonde celebrity walks by, surrounded by her entourage. Dark sunglasses obscure her face. She ducks her head and slides into the back seat of a waiting black Mercedes SUV with black tinted windows just as the paparazzi catch up, at least a dozen photographers calling to her.</p><p>I\u2019ve only been approached by someone in public twice. The first was several years ago, here in LA. As my father and I had lunch after an audition, a woman with a toddler in tow approached the table. She told me that my role as the daughter of a bipolar woman in a television ad for antidepressant meds prompted her to seek help for her depression. My father beamed and said, \u201cWould you like an autograph? Emma, sign your napkin.\u201d</p> <p>The second time was a couple of months ago, the result of a minor role in a periodically re-aired Lifetime movie. Emily had a choir competition in San Francisco, about ninety miles south of Sacramento, and I tagged along for the weekend. While exploring a tiny indie bookstore, we were approached by a girl.</p><p>\u201cHey, were you in that movie about the Civil War? You were the sister of that guy who deserted the Rebs to join the Union?\u201d I nodded guardedly, and she continued. \u201cWell my dad went to Notre Dame, and my brother decided to go to Michigan State, and it\u2019s like he defected to the dark side!\u201d She laid a hand on my forearm and I resisted the urge to jerk away. \u201cMy whole family\u2019s pissed! I totally identified with your character, you know?\u201d I nodded, but I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Emily offered to take a photo of me with my fan, this stranger who eagerly slung her arm around me and pressed her face to mine. I\u2019m pretty sure I looked beyond freaked.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019ve gotta go now, thanks for watching,\u201d Emily said, thrusting the phone into the girl\u2019s hand, linking my arm through hers and propelling me out the door.</p><p>While I was reviewing lines in my room last night, my father and Chloe went out. When Chloe knocked on my door to tell me, I could see her to-the-shoulder earrings and full-throttle eyeliner through the peephole. Her outfit was more like a couple of wide belts than a legitimate top and bottom. They returned at 3 a.m., obviously wasted. I heard them trying to get their key card to open a neighboring door, then mine, and finally their own.</p><p>At the table this morning, my father is mute and Chloe wears sunglasses and nurses black coffee. She\u2019s not thrilled about my table choice, adjacent to the floor-to-ceiling wall of windows with a view of the sunny blue sky on this rare non-hazy day; but it\u2019s the perfect spot to people watch. Until Dan arrives to interrogate me about my audition for the enviable role of Lizbeth Bennet opposite Reid Alexander.</p><p>\u201cIn his last film, he all but named his costar.\u201d Dan gestures animatedly with both hands, his elbows on the table. \u201cThe director was on the fence between two or three, and I heard that he said \u2018I want Allyson\u2019 and she was in.\u201d I seriously doubt that even Reid Alexander has that sort of power, but I keep this thought to myself.</p><p>Dan eyes me closely, as he always does when he is about to make an Important Statement. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for chemistry. This is \u2018Darcy and Elizabeth,\u2019 for chrissake.\u201d All three of them stare at me. Chemistry between the romantic leads. What a novel concept.</p> <p>\u201cUm, okay, I know.\u201d I only just refrain from rolling my eyes. \u201cI think it went well, but we\u2019re either going to have chemistry or we aren\u2019t, right? I assume they\u2019ll do callbacks on several\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichter has been directing for two decades. Big names, big films. He knows chemistry, and if the two of you have it, he\u2019ll see it.\u201d Is that not what I just said? \u201cWhat\u2014specifically\u2014did he say when he stopped the scene?\u201d He asked me this exact question five minutes ago. I don\u2019t know if he thinks I\u2019m lying or just carelessly omitting something significant.</p><p>My jaw clenches and I repeat, verbatim, the answer I gave five minutes ago. \u201cHe said, \u2018Good, good,\u2019 then thanked me, then said they\u2019d be in touch.\u201d</p><p>Dan pinches his chin between his perfectly manicured fingers, the face of his TAG Heuer watch peeking out from the cuff of his impeccable azure blue dress shirt. \u201cHe stopped you before the kiss was started, then,\u201d he reiterates, \u201cBut he said, \u2018Good, good,\u2019 right after.\u201d</p><p>Oh. My. God. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis could work, this could be fine, possibly he wants to see buildup\u2014I mean anyone can kiss.\u201d If Dan actually believes that, I feel sorry for him. Even with my somewhat limited experience, I know that not everyone can kiss. If rumors are reliable, Reid Alexander will leave me in a puddle at his feet. I doubt the likelihood of this, though, because the best-looking guys aren\u2019t always the best kissers, as backwards as that notion seems.</p><p>My first kiss was with a costar in the intergalactic explorer movie. We engaged in hours of private rehearsals after that while on location. But Justin lived in New Jersey, and once filming ended, we were too young to cross the distance between Newark and Sacramento. At the time, I thought I would die from heartbreak. Later, I was more depressed to discover that Justin had been a bright kissing light in a sea of dim bulbs.</p><p>Dan\u2019s cell phone begins playing a late-80s rap song, and he unclips it from his belt and punches it, holding up one finger to shush the three of us, though no one is talking. \u201cDan Walters here. Yes, of course. Fabulous. Three o\u2019clock, no prob. Thanks much, Daria.\u201d</p><p>His expression is almost manic as he turns to me. \u201cWe\u2019re on, baby. You and Reid are having another go, tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d Chloe claps her fingers as though Dan is speaking to her. This is a fundamental Chloe move. She\u2019s like a wind-up monkey that winds itself.</p><p>Dan shakes his head slightly (I know the feeling) and addresses my father. \u201cConnor, have her there tomorrow by 2:50. Early enough to look interested, but not overly eager. I\u2019ll start working on what we\u2019re going to push for in terms of salary. I\u2019ll be in touch, hopefully soon.\u201d He lays a hand on my forearm. \u201cKnock \u2019em dead.\u201d One more gulp of coffee (no way Dan actually needs any sort of stimulant) and he\u2019s gliding back through the restaurant and out the entrance.</p><p>Me: Got a callback. 3pm tomorrow. Probably kissing reid alexander. Wish me luck.</p><p>Em: Do you NEED LUCK?!? Sounds like you already HAVE IT, lol.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>REID</p><p>Emma Pierce is the fourth of five callbacks. In an attempt to be professional, I\u2019ve focused on each of the three before her while we were running scenes, but all day I\u2019m crackling with energy, humming with it, waiting for her.</p><p>When Daria shows her in, I feel as though I\u2019ve been plugged into a socket. I study the sides though I could recite all of my lines and hers, delaying the moment when our eyes meet, knowing it will trigger a power surge between us when we speak the lines. We\u2019re doing the same scene we did two days ago, but this time there will be no interruption from Richter.</p><p>He calls us to our places and she turns away, a shadow of confusion on her face, but ready. Richter calls action, and as I touch her shoulder, she turns to me, scowling, perfectly in character, and I wish we were filming on set right now because this will be as good as it gets. We run through the lines as though we\u2019ve rehearsed this scene a dozen times, and when she says the last line, \u201cWhat?\u201d I grip her shoulders per the script direction and kiss her.</p><p>I know when I touch her that my hold on her isn\u2019t going to be right and will seem antagonistic, but I\u2019m following script direction. We\u2019ll have to redo it, but that\u2019s fine. The chemistry is undeniable. She sways a bit when I release her, the green in her gray eyes sparking. She feels it, too.</p><p>\u201cCut.\u201d Richter is out of his chair, his lips pursed in thought. One hand taps against the side of his leg as he stares at us. He didn\u2019t budge from his seated position during the last three callbacks. \u201cToo aggressive, I think, Reid.\u201d More lip-pursing and thigh-tapping. \u201cLet\u2019s go again from the beginning. More passion, less dominance on the kiss.\u201d He\u2019s letting me guide the scene physically\u2014precisely how I work best. \u201cEmma, a little more reaction\u2014you\u2019re starting to respond just before he pulls away.\u201d</p><p>As the cameras are realigned, I smile down at her, whispering, \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>She smiles back, still nervous, which is fine. All she has to do is follow my lead, which she\u2019s doing flawlessly so far. This time, I pull her towards me, one hand cradling the back of her head, the other sliding down her arm, tugging her forward onto her toes, unbalancing her so that she leans into me as I kiss her. Hands curled into my chest, she\u2019s a perfect illustration of Lizbeth Bennet\u2019s surrender to Will Darcy\u2019s passion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cExcellent, spot on,\u201d Richter says. He rubs his hands together.</p><p>Hell, yeah.</p><p>Daria shows Emma to the exit after we run another couple of scenes and Richter tells her he\u2019ll be in touch. She nods and thanks him, glancing at me. My relaxed expression gives nothing away, but there\u2019s no doubt in my mind\u2014she\u2019s Lizbeth.</p><p>Emma</p> <p>When I come home from the gym a week after the audition, my father and Chloe are popping a bottle of champagne. \u201cYou got the part!\u201d he says as Chloe squeals and offers me a glass. I\u2019ve been chosen to play Lizbeth Bennet in School Pride. The financial details were settled for more than I\u2019ve earned in the past several years combined. Filming will start in mid-August, on location in Austin.</p><p>Dazed by the news, the salary, and the thought of working with Reid Alexander for three solid months, I do what any other girl would do. I grab my phone and text my best friend. Emily is at choir practice, but I\u2019m hoping the threat of choir director ire won\u2019t keep her from answering.</p><p>Me: I GOT IT</p><p>Em: OHMYGOD!!!</p><p>Me: I know! Holy SHIT.</p> <p>Em: I have never been jealous of you before, but OMG REID ALEXANDER!?!!!!</p><p>Me: I\u2019ll call you after the champagne celebration and chloe\u2019s dance of glee. UGH.</p><p>Em: Ignore her. This is about YOU &lt;3</p><p>Me: Will try, idk if ignoring her is possible, you have no idea.</p><p>Em: Oh trust me, i have an idea.</p><p>\u201cI guess we might not be able to do this forever, huh?\u201d Emily says, glancing around the mall food court, the straw of her smoothie never leaving her mouth. It\u2019s late July. In less than a month, I\u2019ll be departing for Austin to film my first wide-release movie.</p> <p>\u201cWhat, go out in public?\u201d I recall the paparazzi-mobbed celeb I\u2019d watched from the hotel restaurant in LA. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be that well-known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we don\u2019t know how famous you\u2019ll be, do we? Don\u2019t forget,\u201d she leans closer and lowers her voice, \u201cyou\u2019ll be kissing Reid Alexander, making you the object of loathing and hate mail for half the preteen girls from here to Canada.\u201d</p><p>Any time I think of that kiss, I still feel it. What I said about hot guys not being the best kissers? Scratch. That.</p><p>\u201cCrap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally. Except the kissing Reid Alexander part.\u201d Emily leers, waggling her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cEm,\u201d I shake my head, \u201cyou have a one-track mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatev, babe. I\u2019ve tried to warn you regarding the underbelly of the lives of the rich and famous\u2014it isn\u2019t pretty. Drugs, drinking, accidental porn...\u201d She slurps the last of her smoothie.</p><p>\u201cEmily, you know I don\u2019t\u2014okay wait, what the hell is accidental porn?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know, the kind where you have no idea your innocently lascivious weekend was filmed through a teeny camera in the ceiling, until it\u2019s too late and people are downloading it off the Internet like, well, online porn.\u201d She swirls a fry through the pool of ketchup we\u2019re sharing.</p><p>\u201cInnocently lascivious?\u201d I\u2019m not sure if I should be insulted or jealous of this version of myself that Emily is painting.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not judging your sex life here, I\u2019m just saying it like it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily Watson, you know better than anyone that I don\u2019t have a sex life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHollywood changes things like that. It\u2019s like a giant vortex of hedonism.\u201d Clearly, Emily needs a break from her SAT prep books.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re the expert on all things Hollywood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh. I read the Globe, Sun, Star and of course The National Enquirer. The facts are all there. It\u2019s a seamy little business you\u2019ve gotten yourself into.\u201d Emily has inherited the online form of her mother\u2019s inability to pass a juicy tabloid cover in the grocery line without buying it. On many occasions we\u2019ve grabbed stacks of them on the way to the pool, where we challenge each other to unearth the wackiest story.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could take you with me,\u201d I tell her, meaning it. \u201cYou keep me sane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019ll just have to keep doing it from afar. One of us is obligated to actually attend high school, while the other stars in a movie in which she attends high school. Irony. Gotta love it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>REID</p><p>No matter how rich or famous you are, you still have to pack when you go somewhere, and packing for a three-month absence is a pain in the ass.</p><p>Tadd Wyler is playing my character\u2019s best friend, Charlie. We were introduced at a Grammy\u2019s after-party a couple of years ago and have been friends since then, so this was uber cool news. He\u2019s meeting me on the flight, and production is sending a bodyguard along with us, which is a first. Usually one delivers me to the flight and another meets me when I land. My last film came out two months ago and the recognition factor has gone through the roof since then. You haven\u2019t lived until just standing near a pack of girls makes them cry. Insanity.</p><p>Bob the bodyguard arrives right on time, sweeping three months of luggage into his beefy paws and ferrying it out to the waiting limo in two trips. He\u2019s a brick building shaped like a man. I can\u2019t imagine anyone getting past this guy\u2014not that I\u2019m afraid of my fan base, but en masse, they can get a little out of hand. \u201cI\u2019ll be back for the rest of your luggage, and then I\u2019ll wait in the car. We\u2019ll leave in about fifteen minutes, if that\u2019s good with you, Mr. Alexander.\u201d</p><p>I need to get over the strangeness of grown men calling me Mr. Alexander. I feel like they can\u2019t be talking to me. \u201cThanks, man. And call me Reid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Mr. Reid.\u201d He disappears into the dusk as Mom sidles up behind me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you.\u201d Her voice is wobbly. She has a drink in her hand, so I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s overcome by emotion or she\u2019s already sloshed. A little of both, perhaps.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a few minutes. Let\u2019s sit.\u201d I take her hand and lead her into the front parlor, sinking onto the sofa with her. She leans into me, still holding my hand, finishing her drink and setting the glass lopsidedly onto a coaster. This must be her third, at least. She doesn\u2019t miss the coaster before that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back for a weekend or two during filming. You\u2019ll hardly notice I\u2019m gone.\u201d This isn\u2019t quite true. Even if we don\u2019t interact much, Mom and I are aware of each other in the house. I\u2019ll be in Austin, working, playing... I think of Emma and my pulse spikes for a moment. Mom will be here, wandering the house like a ghost. \u201cDon\u2019t you have that breast cancer benefit to work on? That should keep you busy until I\u2019m home, right?\u201d I hate to think of her with nothing to do but drink. Alone.</p><p>She brightens. \u201cYes. Melinda and I are organizing a fundraiser for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? You\u2019ll be so busy you won\u2019t miss me at all.\u201d I put my arm around her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you, too, Mom.\u201d The words feel insincere. I\u2019ll think of her occasionally, worry about her here and there. But we won\u2019t miss each other the same way. I glance at my watch. \u201cTime for me to go. The flight\u2019s in a couple of hours\u2014gotta get checked in and stuff.\u201d</p><p>We stand, and she puts her arms around me, tears in her eyes. I kiss her cheek and hug her back gently. \u201cI love you,\u201d she says into my chest, and I feel myself tense. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so hard for me to say those three words. Most guys throw it around like breath, like bait.</p><p>I give her another hug, and then release her, steadying her by the shoulders. Kissing her cheek one last time, I force the words out. \u201cLove you.\u201d And then I\u2019m in the limo, staring out at the house that Mark and Lucy Alexander built, the house where I\u2019ve lived most of my life. We circle the turn-around and out onto the street, and the tension begins to seep out of me.</p><p>Emma</p><p>I find myself on a flight to Austin\u2014first class\u2014with three School Pride cast members, all of whom are nice, and none of whom are Reid. Dammit.</p><p>Meredith Reynolds will be Lizbeth\u2019s older sister, Jane. We did a commercial for peanut butter when we were five, and small roles in a Lifetime movie together two years ago. MiShaun Grant recently left her comedic role on a Disney channel sitcom that never quite hit expected ratings. She\u2019ll play Lizbeth Bennet\u2019s best friend, Charlotte. The most famous person on our flight is Jenna Black, who\u2019ll play the youngest Bennet sister, Lydia.</p><p>Cast as the daughter of the main character in an Oscar-nominated film two years ago, Jenna collected rave reviews for her performance. She\u2019s rumored to be incredibly smart and planning to attend Princeton. I will earn my high school diploma in a few months, and have never considered going to college. Jenna, fifteen with her whole life mapped out, is insistent.</p><p>\u201cYou should go! You might want to do something else someday. And if you do continue your acting career, you\u2019ll want to cultivate your intellect to get better roles.\u201d</p><p>Cultivate my intellect?</p><p>Her logic may make perfect sense, but I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ve always thought of myself as an average student, but when school is a tutor in a hotel room and you\u2019re turning in assignments over the Internet, there\u2019s no comparison or competition. I have no idea how I measure up to others my age, academically speaking.</p><p>We discuss the script and do some informal rehearsing during the flight. According to the film schedule Richter\u2019s assistant emailed, filming begins at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow at an Austin high school. We have two weeks until school begins there, at which point filming during the week is out, so we\u2019re doing the school sequences first.</p><p>At the hotel, girls mill around the entrance, which seems odd for this hour on a Sunday. \u201cFabulous,\u201d Jenna says. \u201cThe \u2018I heart Reid Alexander\u2019 fan club lost no time on the stalking stakeout.\u201d</p><p>The concierge, after apologizing profusely for giving the four of us the stink-eye when we walked in, confirms her assumption. \u201cWe keep escorting them out, and they keep sneaking back in, bless their hearts.\u201d His set jaw doesn\u2019t say bless their hearts as much as it says I\u2019m getting a migraine.</p><p>Most of the fourth floor rooms are cordoned off for School Pride actors and crew, the studio\u2019s beefy bodyguards in place to protect Reid from his more zealous fans. As I locate my room and slide my key card into the lock mechanism, a door opens two doors down and a cute guy comes into the hallway wearing drawstring pajama bottoms and a white t-shirt. He glances back as if he\u2019s merging into traffic, nods once in my direction with a smile and a soft, \u201cHey,\u201d and raps twice on another door. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s production staff or another one of the actors, but I\u2019m way too tired to think about it for long.</p><p>Reid isn\u2019t shooting any scenes the first day, so he\u2019s not on set. I\u2019m apprehensive about seeing him, nervous about what we\u2019ll be doing on film, in front of everyone. I\u2019ve never worried about this sort of thing before, but then I\u2019ve never been the star of anything before. I\u2019m glad to have a day or two to get familiar with the rest of the cast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We finish our first day of filming around five. Some days will be much longer, and some will require night filming, so we should enjoy this reprieve; but we lost two hours between California and Texas, which made eight a.m. feel like six a.m. Exhausted, Meredith and I climb into one of the cars that will transport us back to the hotel, and Brooke collapses onto the seat next to me. She\u2019s basically a life-sized Barbie doll: perfect build (thin, but curvy where it counts, long dancer\u2019s legs), perfect bone structure, clear blue eyes, blonde hair. Everything is pretty and flawless. Ninety-five percent of what people notice or talk about is her appearance, despite her acting skill. \u201cAre you guys hungry? Because I\u2019m star-ving.\u201d</p><p>My stomach, activated by the thought of food, reminds me that I skipped lunch. Craft services served gourmet pizzas and salads, but I had first-day jitters and couldn\u2019t eat.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Meredith and I chorus.</p><p>Thanks to celery stick lunches, no-bread dinners and lots of cardio, Meredith and I are both slim, with physical features unlikely to inspire either resentment or adoration, but I\u2019ll take a favorable acting review over someone gushing about the shape of my ass any day. My hair color (and Meredith\u2019s) would be termed pecan or tweed according to Chloe, fake hair color expert, who\u2019s been trying to get me to highlight my hair for years by declaring things like, \u201cIt\u2019s so freaking dull,\u201d for motivation.</p> <p>Brooke gives the driver directions to a corner bar and grill a few blocks from the hotel, where we sit by the window and watch as people leave their downtown offices. I ask if she\u2019s been to Austin before, and she says, \u201cI grew up here,\u201d smiling as a group of college boys stroll by, all three slowing when they spot her, one waving with a shy grin. Laughing, she crosses her arms over her chest loosely, sighing, \u201cI would chew him up and spit him out.\u201d The boy who\u2019d waved glances back twice, disappointed and earning a punch in the arm from one of his friends.</p><p>How does Brooke find the time for enough life experience to cause this level of sexual ennui when I don\u2019t have time to go to a regular school or on a regular date? My moments of free time are erratic; granted, I\u2019m more likely to spend them with Emily than with a boy. Boyfriends have been rare\u2014only three. Two were fellow actors and the other was a friend of Emily\u2019s. We broke up because I literally never saw him.</p><p>Brooke scans the place after we\u2019ve eaten, her eyes settling on two young professionals sitting at the bar. \u201cI want an older guy,\u201d she says. As if she\u2019s called his name, one of them glances at Brooke, right in the middle of a sentence, his mouth slightly ajar. She smiles, holding the eye contact for a beat too long to be mistaken for anything but interest. His friend, noting his reaction, looks over as well.</p><p>If either of them watched Life\u2019s a Beach, the teen series Brooke spent the last two years doing, she\u2019d look familiar. Doubtful, at their ages. I watched the show with Emily a few times. Brooke seems shockingly similar to her boy-crazed beach-girl character. Is this an act, or was her character so convincing because she was essentially playing herself?</p><p>She turns back to us, silky hair tossed over her shoulders, and the guy at the bar can\u2019t tear his eyes away from the back of her head. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I was in Texas. Maybe it\u2019s time to find out if everything is bigger here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOhmigod,\u201d Meredith says. \u201cYou are so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try.\u201d Brooke laughs and flashes a quick smile over her shoulder to the guy who\u2019s debating whether or not to walk over. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>REID</p><p>I spot Emma the moment I get to the set, watch her glancing around\u2014looking for me, I think. When our gazes connect, she smiles shyly. I return her smile and then shift my attention back to Tadd, who\u2019s got a running commentary going about the disappointing lack of boots and cowboy hats he\u2019s seen since landing in Austin.</p><p>\u201cI get the whole \u2018keep Austin weird\u2019 and \u2018we\u2019re an artsy, freethinking town,\u2019 but you\u2019d think they could at least nod towards the conventional Marlboro man look enough to give the place an authentic Texas feel.\u201d He huffs a sigh and twitches his head, his hair lifting and falling right back where it was.</p> <p>Occasionally someone in the media or the public sees my blond hair and blue eyes, adds \u2018lives in California,\u2019 and concludes surfer dude. Standing next to Tadd, though, I could be from Canada. His platinum blond hair, straight as a razor, has two options: feathered straight down around his face, as it is now, or spiked straight up. That, coupled with clear blue eyes, a perpetual tan and his propensity to actually say things like dude, edge me out.</p><p>\u201cYou do realize Brokeback was set in Wyoming, not Texas, right?\u201d</p><p>He peers at me through his bangs before pushing them back. \u201cAnd your point is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should go look for your personal Marlboro man there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019re filming just over a thousand miles south of Wyoming right now,\u201d he retorts.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d I ask. Tadd has a memory bank full of trivia, apparently including an innate knowledge of US geography.</p><p>\u201cThat is not the point!\u201d He pretends exasperation, and I laugh as conversations fade and eyes widen near us. \u201cThe point is where the hell are the cowboys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDallas?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHar-de-har,\u201d he deadpans.</p><p>That\u2019s when I spot Brooke coming onto the set. I haven\u2019t seen her, in person anyway, in years. She\u2019s even more beautiful than she was at sixteen. Staggeringly so. A morbid curiosity settles over me concerning how this is going to proceed. She\u2019s talking to Meredith Reynolds when she sees me. My role in School Pride has been well publicized\u2014it can\u2019t be a surprise that I\u2019m here. Even still, she appears taken aback. I stare at her with just a hint of a smile. I don\u2019t want her to know that her face still has the power to take my breath away. Her eyes narrow for the length of one heartbeat, and then her face goes passive. She never wavers in her conversation, turns away, doesn\u2019t look at me again.</p><p>We\u2019ll have to interact at some point. Her character is the sister of my character\u2019s best friend. We have scenes together, speaking parts with each other. Plus, in a group this small, there will be interaction between all of us, socially. If we\u2019re wishing each other dead, even silently, it won\u2019t go unnoticed.</p><p>When I walk up to the craft services table during lunch break, I end up just behind Emma and MiShaun. Perusing the spread of sandwiches, fruit, cookies and drinks, MiShaun touches Emma\u2019s arm lightly, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t fall asleep standing up. That wouldn\u2019t end well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Emma blinks, stares into the steaming cup in her hand, and yawns. \u201cI would kill for a double shot latt\u00e9. This coffee is awful, but I need the caffeine.\u201d</p><p>MiShaun selects a turkey sandwich and a bottle of raspberry iced tea. \u201cThe time change can feel like mini jet lag. Why don\u2019t you get one of the set assistants to run to the nearest coffee house and grab a latt\u00e9 for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I do that? I mean would that be an asshole thing to ask?\u201d</p><p>Wow, she\u2019s got a lot to learn about being a movie star.</p><p>MiShaun laughs. \u201cNo, crazy, they don\u2019t want the stars running off set to get their own drug of choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d I ask, stepping up between them, grabbing a sandwich from the top of one pyramid and taking a bite. Tuna. Not my favorite, but Olaf, my trainer, would approve of the protein content.</p><p>MiShaun cocks an eyebrow at me. \u201cYou\u2019re funny. Don\u2019t you two have a kissing scene in a few minutes? And there you go eating tuna fish, no care at all for poor Emma.\u201d</p><p>I stop chewing. \u201cShit. I forgot.\u201d I want to kick myself\u2014I forgot we\u2019re about to kiss isn\u2019t the most flattering thing to say.</p><p>\u201cUm, that\u2019s okay.\u201d Emma takes the smallest wedge of tuna sandwich on the platter. \u201cI\u2019ll eat a bite, and then I won\u2019t really notice you, uh, having eaten any.\u201d She nibbles it, grimacing almost imperceptibly. \u201cSee. Problem solved.\u201d</p><p>She just ate something she hates to make me feel better. This bodes well on multiple levels. \u201cSo both of us eating it counteracts the effect? Clever. I was about to find a potted plant to spit it into.\u201d</p><p>She laughs, thank God. \u201cNuh-uh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYuh-huh!\u201d</p><p>MiShaun shakes her head as though we\u2019re both unbalanced.</p><p>\u201cSo, some of us are heading down to the strip tonight. Are you tagging along?\u201d I invite her as part of the group, rather than disclosing that I want her there for myself. I take another sandwich and MiShaun gives me a horrified look.</p><p>\u201cReid Alexander, what would your legions of faithful fans think if I told them you eat smelly tuna sandwiches non-stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy trainer says I need to eat! Can\u2019t a guy get some protein without seeking approval from everyone? God!\u201d Smiling, I snatch a third sandwich and start to walk away, turning without stopping and pointing at Emma. Like an afterthought. \u201cSo yes for tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure. Sounds cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome. See you in a few.\u201d</p><p>Emma</p><p>We\u2019re filming the scene of the audition.</p><p>When Reid pulls me into his arms and brushes his mouth over mine, he tastes like spearmint. There\u2019s no trace of tuna anywhere, which means we\u2019ve both brushed our teeth since our earlier conversation at the craft services table. (I also flossed and gargled. Twice.) No one but me would know or care whether he tastes like fish or candy when we kiss; his minty fresh breath is for me alone. This knowledge sends a silly spark of euphoria through me.</p><p>And then Richter pulls me back to earth. \u201cCut! Perfect. Unfortunately, we have to film it again.\u201d Unfortunately is not the word I would use for a required retake. He swivels around, looking for someone. \u201cScott\u2014the lighting is much too ambient. It\u2019s a high school hallway for chrissake, it\u2019s going to be bright.\u201d</p><p>I steal a glance at Reid as he stands next to me, the ends of his hair being tweaked to best show the streaks of light blond highlights through the natural dark blond. His eyes are closed as our hair girl, all five foot zero of her, circles him, pulling and spraying. Someone brushes powder on my forehead and refreshes my lip color. Before I have the sense to look away, his eyes open and he\u2019s staring back. He smiles then, and my mouth goes dry. I lick my lips lightly and his gaze darts to my mouth. When his gaze drifts back to mine, his smile both devious and breathtaking.</p><p>Oh, yeah. I\u2019m in trouble.</p><p>We have an outdoor scene to film this afternoon. Meredith and I rehearse lines as we near the exit, until we hear screams from the street-side end of the parking lot. Brooke and Jenna come up behind us and we all peek out.</p><p>Jenna sighs. \u201cLooks like afternoon filming is about to hit a snag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think every mindless girl in Texas between twelve and twenty is at the other end of that lot,\u201d Brooke says.</p><p>\u201cMore I heart Reid Alexander fans?\u201d I ask needlessly, and she nods. I\u2019m relieved to see our cast bodyguards and two local police officers on our side of the temporary three-foot barrier. Meredith and I exit cautiously while Jenna and Brooke stride out ahead, unconcerned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, if any of them get over that blockade, they\u2019ll make a beeline straight for Reid,\u201d Jenna tells Meredith and me. \u201cMaybe Quinton, but he shouldn\u2019t hold his breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d want that?\u201d Meredith points at the screaming crowd.</p><p>\u201cGuys always want it.\u201d Brooke answers. \u201cThey assume every girl on the planet thinks they\u2019re hot as hell and they\u2019ll get laid any time they want. Which is, for the most part, true.\u201d</p><p>A piercing scream for Reid rings across the lot. \u201cGod, how will we get any filming done?\u201d Meredith mumbles.</p> <p>\u201cDepends what Richter does about it.\u201d Jenna shrugs. \u201cFans aren\u2019t inherently evil, and they don\u2019t want to ruin the film. They\u2019re just a little irrational.\u201d</p><p>Jenna\u2019s Oscar-nominated film starred a couple of red-hot thirty-somethings, and the experience left her with an undaunted perception of celebrity groupies. I suspect she\u2019ll need that aloofness. Her dark hair, huge gray eyes and full lips inspired a Vogue photographer to dub her face a work of art last spring, and the cover featuring her not-quite-grown version of Brooke\u2019s build kicked off a few countdown-to-18 calculations (yet another reason I\u2019m satisfied with my non-bombshell body).</p><p>Reid\u2019s exit from the building causes pandemonium like nothing I\u2019ve ever witnessed, with the possible exception of a bad call during a game my father and I attended at Yankee Stadium years ago. He ducks his head shyly before raising one hand in the direction of the uproar, which only increases the clamor.</p><p>The fans are eventually persuaded to settle down with the promise of an up-close visit from Reid for photos and autographs when we\u2019re done. He\u2019s either exceptionally dedicated or just reckless; nothing will entice me to venture near that insanity. The crowd remains hushed every time Richter turns towards them and holds his hands up, right up until he yells, \u201cCut!\u201d at which point they lose it again.</p><p>By the time the light is too muted to film outside, the fans have been waiting for hours. \u201cCome with me,\u201d Reid says, smiling and holding his hand out for mine.</p> <p>\u201cEr...\u201d I eye the crowd, remembering my earlier intention to never get anywhere near that.</p><p>\u201cCome on, they\u2019ll want to meet Lizbeth Bennet.\u201d His voice is warm, coaxing. I take a deep breath and reach for his hand against all of my natural inclination.</p><p>Well. Maybe not all of my natural inclination.</p><p>Me: Reid dragged me over to meet his rabid fans when we were done.</p><p>Em: OMG! Will there be pictures on the internet??</p><p>Me: Ha, i\u2019m sure. Going out with everyone tonight. A club i think. Not sure i can get in?</p> <p>Em: You\u2019re a celebrity now, they\u2019ll let you in everywhere!</p><p>Me: Idk</p><p>Em: If you make out with reid take pictures on your phone and SEND THEM TO ME</p><p>Me: EMILY you know i don\u2019t kiss and sext</p><p>Em: Oh fine just forget the little people now that you\u2019re a big star</p><p>Me: Em. You know you\u2019ll never be little people to me</p><p>Em: Miss you toooo</p><p>Chapter 9</p> <p>REID</p><p>\u201cLook at this suite\u2014holy shit, do girls even get all the way into the room before their panties hit the floor?\u201d Tadd\u2019s come up to my room with me to borrow my laptop.</p><p>\u201cJealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf the girls? I think not. Of your room? Hell, yeah.\u201d He plops onto the king-sized bed, hands behind his head. \u201cCorner balcony. Elevated bed. Fresh flowers. Dude. Sweet.\u201d I hand him the laptop and he brings up his email. \u201cHey man, is Quinton a go for tonight?\u201d</p><p>I pull out my phone and tap a text. Quinton texts back a yes a minute later. \u201cOf course he is\u2014Quinton\u2019s always a go. Who else? MiShaun and Emma said yes earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to some of the extras about where the best spots are, so a bunch of them might show. And I told Meredith, Jenna and Brooke... and Graham, who, by the way, is hot and I was hoping also gay, because he appears to be close friends with Brooke, but no such luck.\u201d</p><p>I process this for a moment. \u201cGraham and Brooke are close\u2014and he\u2019s straight? How do you know they aren\u2019t screwing each other? Maybe they\u2019re a thing. Or a friends-with-benefits thing.\u201d</p><p>Tadd shrugs. \u201cMaybe. I didn\u2019t get that vibe, but hey, you people make everything more complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s complicated about friends-with-benefits?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, his eyes still on the screen. \u201cDude, that\u2019s something my people perfected long ago. You guys can\u2019t get away with it because girls are more likely to want emotion, attachment, love.\u201d The latter is punctuated with an exaggerated shudder.</p><p>\u201cYou obviously don\u2019t know Brooke very well. She\u2019s like a guy with boobs.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cSorry, Reid, but in my world, the primary aspect being a guy is not the having or not having of boobs. I\u2019ve seen Brooke\u2019s Life\u2019s a Beach promos\u2014her swimsuits are a couple of ribbons tied together. If she has underlying physical features of which I\u2019m unaware, I\u2019d like to know where she\u2019s hiding them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAaaand thanks for that mental picture,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat I mean is, she thinks like a guy. She\u2019s detached. Calculating.\u201d</p><p>He closes the laptop and puts it aside. \u201cSo you screwed her and she didn\u2019t love you back? Aww, that\u2019s so sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off, man.\u201d Laughing, I shove him and he rolls off the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat I mean is, she sounds perfect! You can screw each other\u2019s brains out and just walk away.\u201d He sits back down on the bed, his eyes on mine. \u201cOr is that pretty much what already happened...\u201d</p><p>I forgot how good Tadd is at digging deep fast. \u201cSomething like that. I really don\u2019t care.\u201d And I don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThen who cares what she and Graham are doing?\u201d he says, making all sorts of sense.</p><p>I think about Emma. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ve got better ways to spend my time.\u201d</p><p>Emma</p><p>I raise my voice above the music so MiShaun can hear me. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we all got in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet used to celebrity, baby!\u201d She clinks her glass to mine. Once the guy at the door got a look at Reid, we were all escorted inside without an eye-bat at anyone\u2019s ID.</p><p>Our group takes up a corner near the bar plus half of the tiny dance floor, and our brawny bodyguards look like they\u2019re standing inside a child\u2019s playhouse. While I sip my drink, we examine the rest of the cast. Jenna, Meredith, Tadd and Reid are dancing. Brooke is seated on a velvet sofa with the guy I\u2019d seen leaving his hotel room in his pajamas two nights ago.</p><p>I lean to MiShaun. \u201cWho\u2019s the guy sitting next to Brooke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Graham Douglas.\u201d Though he\u2019s twenty feet from us and can\u2019t possibly hear, his eyes snap up. He smiles and tips his chin back like guys do to indicate a sort of non-verbal hey, and MiShaun raises her drink in his direction. When Brooke turns to see who\u2019s taken Graham\u2019s attention from her, I develop a sudden and intense interest in the dance floor.</p><p>Running through the cast names in my head, I realize Graham is playing the part of Bill Collins, one of the nerdiest guys in literature. I slide my eyes back to him. In close conversation with Brooke, he leans in as she speaks, one arm draped across the back of the low sofa. \u201cDo you know him?\u201d His dark hair is on the longish side, swept back except for errant sections that fall forward. Unlike the other guys in our group, who are fashionably disheveled in t-shirts and jeans, Graham wears black slacks and a blue button-down, top buttons undone, sleeves rolled up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never worked with him. He\u2019s done mostly indie stuff. He was in something that did well in Sundance this year...\u201d</p><p>Graham Douglas is nothing like I would picture Elizabeth Bennet\u2019s ridiculous cousin. \u201cHe\u2019s sort of, I don\u2019t know\u2014too good-looking to play Collins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fellow Jane Austen fan!\u201d MiShaun puts a hand up for a high-five. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, once he gets into makeup, they\u2019ll do ghastly things to that handsome mug.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help thinking that will be a shame.</p><p>Dragging my gaze from Graham, I notice that Reid has gathered a small harem of locals on the dance floor. The bodyguards hover, not interfering, but ready to at a second\u2019s notice. MiShaun follows the direction of my gaze and shakes her head. \u201cThat boy is such a player.\u201d</p><p>In everything I\u2019ve ever heard about Reid Alexander, one thing he hasn\u2019t done is sustained a relationship past a matter of weeks. Player is right, and I shouldn\u2019t expect anything more from him, chemistry or no chemistry. Even still, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s looked at me once since we arrived.</p><p>Quinton Beauvier, whose role is the notoriously charming George Wickham, steps up behind us then, placing a hand on each of our shoulders. \u201cLadies,\u201d he says. Tall and dark-skinned, hair cropped short, he\u2019s boyishly handsome and easily the most muscled guy in the cast. An article in Emily\u2019s favorite gossip magazine claimed he was as the hottest young actor to watch, and included a pull-out poster\u2014now prominently taped on her closet door\u2014in which he leans against a rickety rail fence wearing an introspective look, hands hooked in the front pockets of his low-slung jeans, biceps bulging out of a skin-tight white t-shirt.</p><p>\u201cMr. Beauvier,\u201d MiShaun says, smiling.</p><p>\u201cWould either of you like to dance? Reid and his cult followers are monopolizing the floor, and that boy can\u2019t even dance. Look at him, just swaying around. Pitiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn his defense, he doesn\u2019t have room to do much else,\u201d I say, and Quinton laughs.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. So it\u2019s the principle of the thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo dance, Emma. I\u2019m gonna head back to the bar for another one of these,\u201d MiShaun holds up her disappearing cosmopolitan, \u201cand then I\u2019m going to go ask that blond guy who\u2019s been staring at me for the last fifteen minutes to dance. Or something...\u201d She gestures over her shoulder, where a guy in a white starched shirt and loose tie leans against the bar within a group of friends. Any time he looks away from MiShaun, his eyes wander back to her within seconds.</p><p>Quinton takes my hand and flashes a brilliant smile. \u201cLet\u2019s show that boy how it\u2019s done.\u201d I don\u2019t know if Reid\u2019s watching or not, but for a few minutes, I forget about him.</p><p>Ten minutes later, I tell Quinton, \u201cYou\u2019re an awesome dancer.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, revealing small dimples and utterly perfect teeth. Emily will die when I tell her. \u201cI love to dance. It was my backup plan, in case the acting thing didn\u2019t work out.\u201d I look out over the crowd, most of whom are watching our group. Reid sips a beer near the bar, girls surrounding him. He glances up then and smiles at me, but doesn\u2019t make any move to break from his groupies.</p><p>I turn away, ask Quinton if he\u2019s seen MiShaun.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still talking to that scruffy white guy.\u201d He gestures towards a dark corner, where the two are seated at a tiny table in close proximity, talking animatedly. Quinton shrugs and we both smile.</p><p>After a couple of hours, another drink, and several dances with numerous cast members (none of whom are Reid, dammit), the physical exertion reminds me how much I need to get back into my daily running routine. There\u2019s no way I can stay out later and get up at the crack of dawn to run. I tell Quinton and Meredith I\u2019m going back to the hotel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Quinton sways closer, a beer in one hand, the other outstretched. \u201cYou can\u2019t give out now. It\u2019s early!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s 1 a.m.!\u201d I laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just getting started!\u201d Meredith says.</p><p>\u201cI have to get up tomorrow morning and run.\u201d</p> <p>They both look horrified. \u201cWhat, before shooting?\u201d</p><p>I wave to Jenna, who\u2019s dancing nearby, but I don\u2019t look for Reid. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a million degrees by noon. See you guys tomorrow!\u201d</p><p>The valet calls a taxi while I wait in the shadow of the building, watching the mixture of young professionals and college students pass. I\u2019ve never told anyone except Emily, but I know I owe my acting ability to compulsive people-watching. I could never express the emotions of so many various people, some of whom I can\u2019t stand even if they are fictional, if I didn\u2019t constantly watch people interact.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll have a taxi over in a couple minutes,\u201d the valet tells me with a slight drawl.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I answer, handing him a tip.</p> <p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d He smiles back and stuffs the bill in the front pocket of his vest.</p><p>As I peel a breath mint from its wrapper, Graham Douglas exits the club alone and moves to the opposite side of the entrance, lighting a cigarette. Something about a well-dressed guy lighting up is curiously attractive. This allure can probably be traced to the old black and white movies Mom and I used to watch, where everyone smoked: Cary Grant and Clark Gable and Bette Davis, men in tuxedos, women in glittering gowns, cigarettes loosely held like insidious little props.</p><p>Lighter back in his pocket, Graham takes a deep draw, exhaling as though every muscle in his body is releasing the stress of the day with the hazy stream. Passing girls glance at him with sidelong gazes, checking to see if he\u2019s noticed them while he leans against the brick wall, running a hand through his dark hair and tapping on his cell. He seems oblivious until with no warning he lifts his gaze and I\u2019m caught staring at him for the second time tonight. Smiling and pushing away from the wall, he crosses to me.</p><p>\u201cHey, you caught me,\u201d he says, echoing my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cTaking a break from the club scene, or are you just that addicted?\u201d I ask, teasing.</p><p>He glances at the cigarette in his hand like he has no idea how it got there. \u201cEr... both?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMa\u2019am, your taxi\u2019s here,\u201d the valet interrupts.</p><p>\u201cGoing back to the hotel?\u201d he asks, and I nod. \u201cMind if I tag along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, no problem,\u201d I say. He crams the cigarette into an ashtray atop a trash can and follows me into the cab as I give the name of the hotel to the driver.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Graham, by the way.\u201d He holds his hand out and I take it. His grip is firm but not crushing.</p><p>\u201cEmma.\u201d The cab driver makes a humph sound and I realize that we\u2019ve just gotten into a cab bound for a hotel, and we\u2019re exchanging names. My face flames in the darkness.</p><p>Graham\u2019s eyes narrow, flashing momentarily to the cabbie. He clears his throat. \u201cSo how did filming go today? I meant to go along to observe, but decided I could use a day to go over the script and, you know, oversleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt went really well. Some interesting off-camera action, too\u2014Reid had a devoted crowd of groupies just off set.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, smiling. \u201cYeah, if fans discover his location, he\u2019s mobbed wherever he goes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh,\u201d I say.</p><p>His phone buzzes and he checks the screen, types a reply and returns it to his pocket. When we arrive at the hotel, he brushes off my effort to pay half. We\u2019re both silent as we walk to the elevator. I think about him leaving his room in his pajamas to play sleepover with someone, probably Brooke, from their postures in the club... But he left the club, and Brooke, and came back to the hotel with me. Maybe it was her he was just texting.</p><p>The elevator\u2019s low-key ding announces the fourth floor, and I nearly stop breathing as I realize what he might expect\u2014having come back to the hotel with me. What if he thinks I want to play sleepover? Heart pounding as we walk down the carpeted hallway, I hear nothing beyond the swish, swish, swish of the blood racing through my ears. I recall Emily\u2019s tales of Hollywood hedonism. Shit. I didn\u2019t plan to stand out as the cast prude quite so soon, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019m sleeping with some guy I just met, I don\u2019t care how hot he is.</p><p>As we approach his door, he pulls out his wallet, retrieves his key card and turns to me as he sticks it into the lock. \u201cThanks for sharing your cab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Swish, swish, swish.</p><p>The lock on his door blinks green and he opens the door. \u201cWell, goodnight,\u201d he says, while I stand there like a moron.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d I turn quickly, rummaging in my bag for my key card as I walk away. Unlocking my door, I glance back, and I\u2019m alone in the hallway, muttering, \u201cIdiot,\u201d to myself.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>REID</p><p>A quarter after one, and I haven\u2019t seen Emma in a few minutes. I\u2019ve been keeping track of where she is all night, covertly. The one time we made eye contact, she was dancing with Quinton. They moved perfectly together, and she looked so hot I almost ditched the mindless pack of girls clustered around and asked her to dance right then. I opted to wait a little longer. Now I\u2019m rethinking that dimwitted decision, because she\u2019s nowhere.</p><p>Did she leave with some guy? Disappointing, but not impossible. She may be better at this game than I\u2019ve given her credit for. Time for inventory. Quinton\u2019s here, dancing with Jenna. Tadd\u2019s chatting with Brooke\u2014which gives me a moment\u2019s pause, but he\u2019s too loyal to tell her anything I\u2019ve said. He also won\u2019t tell me anything she says, but I really don\u2019t give enough of a shit to want to know anyway.</p><p>Looking at Brooke, though, reminds me of Graham. And I don\u2019t see Graham anywhere.</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m so drunk!\u201d one of the girls near me says, making sure I\u2019m listening. \u201cI feel completely crazy tonight, like I could get talked into doing practically anything.\u201d</p><p>Wow. Subtle. \u201cOh, yeah?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Try me.\u201d She leans against me, breasts all but escaping from the plunging neckline of her sundress.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I glance around the circle, take the hand of another awestruck girl. I pull her forward gently and say to Miss I\u2019m-So-Drunk, \u201cTake my friend here, and go out there and dance together.\u201d</p><p>A flash of disappointment darts across each of their faces before they size each other up. Sharing is better than not having at all. With a wicked smile, girl number one takes girl number two by the hand and they proceed to make a spectacle of themselves, just because I said to.</p><p>Meanwhile, Meredith comes to the bar for a drink and I pull her aside. \u201cHave you seen Emma?\u201d My voice is as casual as can be.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, she left a while back. She said something about running in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, before filming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014crazy, huh?\u201d She takes two drinks from the bartender.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d I get another beer and pay attention to Thing One and Thing Two, who are learning the value of sharing.</p><p>Emma</p><p>My phone alarm sounds at six. I\u2019m momentarily disoriented, then sorry that I made a pact with myself to run. As I pull on shorts and brush my hair into a ponytail, I avoid looking towards the unmade bed, all soft sheets and downy pillows. Perusing the map of running routes around Town Lake that the hotel provided, I lace up my shoes, determined to escape this room before the bed convinces me to ditch the run and sleep.</p><p>As I cross the lobby, I hear my name. Turning, I\u2019m surprised to see Graham in a t-shirt, shorts and Pumas. \u201cHey, going for a run?\u201d he asks, and then he stops, noting my confused expression. \u201cListen, I don\u2019t want to impose if you like to run alone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh... no, I was just going to look for one of the trails on this map.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, then,\u201d he says as we exit the hotel. \u201cI have a vast one day of experience in finding the trails, so I sort of know where to go. If nothing else, I can promise we won\u2019t end up in Dallas. Or Mexico.\u201d</p><p>I note a few girls standing in a cluster off to the side, coffees in hand. They\u2019re watching as Graham and I walk down the steps, disappointment clear on their faces. I wonder if they\u2019re part of Jenna\u2019s \u201cI heart Reid\u201d fanclub.</p><p>\u201cDo you run every day?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs one shoulder. \u201cI do all kinds of stuff\u2014running, rock-climbing, biking, spin class, weights, yoga. Gets boring otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d I say. \u201cI mostly run. I have a hard time remembering to do a sit up or a crunch every now and then. I can\u2019t do aerobics because I\u2019m a horrible dancer. I won\u2019t do a spin class. If I want someone to abuse me verbally during exercise, I\u2019ll just get my agent to drive alongside me and yell obscenities while I run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u2019re a horrible dancer, since I know better from personal, well, not experience, exactly, but maybe personal observation.\u201d He\u2019s studying the map and street signs, and I wonder if he actually meant to tell me he\u2019d watched me dance last night. A warm hum shoots through me, especially in light of Reid\u2019s brush-off, which doesn\u2019t sting any less this morning than it had last night.</p><p>\u201cDancing in a class is different, especially if they have equipment like portable steps or those ginormous rubber bands? Disaster.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cSeriously, who thought up those rubber bands?\u201d</p><p>We run the couple of blocks to the trail as the sun emerges fully behind us, the sky transforming to a lighter and lighter shade of blue, no clouds in sight. Austin is having an unseasonable \u201ccool spell.\u201d According to the local weather update the temps will only be in the mid-nineties by five p.m. I wonder if they understand the definition of the word cool here.</p><p>\u201cThanks for inviting me along,\u201d Graham says, and when I look up at him with the same confused look I had in the lobby, he smiles.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but smile back as he matches his pace to mine.</p><p>We\u2019re far enough from the hotel now that when I glance back, I can\u2019t see it. \u201cDid you see those girls in front of the hotel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWondering if they were some of Reid\u2019s followers?\u201d he asks, and I nod. \u201cProbably so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may want to prepare for your own groupies, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPshhh.\u201d I wave him off, unconvinced that I\u2019m about to become famous, though he\u2019s only echoing what Emily said just before I left home.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re playing opposite someone with his fan base, everything the two of you do will be scrutinized. For instance, if there\u2019s on-screen chemistry, people will assume you have it off-screen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d I say, remembering my foolish thoughts about Reid and chemistry. Before last night. When he blew me off.</p><p>\u201cYou say that a lot, you know.\u201d As we find the trail, the cityscape gives way to gravel paths surrounded by faded, end-of-summer green. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I frown. \u201cI say what a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>A light bulb goes on in my head. \u201cI say \u2018huh\u2019 a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should start counting.\u201d He grins down at me as I\u2019m estimating exactly how embarrassed I should be. \u201cBy the time I get to twenty or so, you\u2019ll have broken the habit if for nothing else than sheer annoyance\u2019s sake. We\u2019ll call that last time one.\u201d</p> <p>I frown at him good-naturedly and he laughs softly again. Is this an old habit, or a newly ingrained one? Why would Emily not point this out? I make a mental note to grill her during our next conversation.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we won\u2019t be that convincing onscreen,\u201d I say, returning to the previous subject, which is not, I realize belatedly, grounds for non-self-conscious discussion.</p><p>\u201cI doubt that. This is an adaptation of one of the most romantic novels ever written. There has to be chemistry.\u201d</p><p>I give him a narrow-eyed look. \u201cIf this is your idea of \u2018no pressure,\u2019 it\u2019s not working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have chosen you if the chemistry wasn\u2019t there. I\u2019m just pointing out what being a romantic lead opposite him might do to your private life. Such as, there\u2019s no way Reid could do what we\u2019re doing right now without bodyguards.\u201d He moves behind me briefly so the elderly couple walking towards us on the pathway don\u2019t have to squish together.</p> <p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about it like that,\u201d I say as he falls in beside me. I think of Emily, who isn\u2019t a crazed fangirl, but would still freak out if she saw Reid in person.</p><p>\u201cWell. No reason to panic. Yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yet,\u201d I echo.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>REID</p><p>Most of the cast is going to Kenichi for sushi. So far, Austin hasn\u2019t been as backwater as I assumed it might be, though most of the city is more laid-back and casual than the parts of LA I\u2019m used to.</p> <p>One glance at Emma tells me she\u2019s still adapting to the commotion caused when we all go anywhere. Tonight, Richter and Leslie Neale are joining us, which adds to the crazy. Leslie, cast as Mrs. Bennet, boasts an impressive film career spanning nearly forty years. Even still, she\u2019s undeniably hot, and as famous for her romantic exploits (often with men decades younger) as she is for her professional capability. The tabloids love her.</p><p>The restaurant staff is either used to celebrities popping in, or they\u2019ve been cautioned to remain composed. The effect on the patrons is a different story. Cell phones angle towards us as we\u2019re ushered to the table, voices whispering from person to person alongside us, like waving grain. Typical crowd reaction to celebrity in their midst.</p><p>Graham and Brooke are behind Quinton, Tadd and me on the way in, Emma and the other girls ahead of us. I haven\u2019t seen Graham with Emma, so I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re acquainted. If Emma left the club with Graham, or someone else, she did so damned discretely, because no one appears to have any idea. I step up to her now, say quietly, \u201cHey beautiful,\u201d my hand at the small of her back. She glances up, the faintest blush spreading across her cheeks. The room instantly begins to speculate about us. I can feel it.</p><p>We\u2019re led through the restaurant to a long table, offset from the others, set parallel to the back wall, which is covered in shoji screens. Semi-private, conversationally speaking, we\u2019re visually conspicuous. I take Emma\u2019s elbow and lead her to the center of the side facing out, and MiShaun files in next to her. Richter takes one of the ends with Leslie Neale to his left, and Quinton takes the other end, everyone else filling in. Graham sits next to Brooke, directly across from us. He smiles at Emma, which tells me they\u2019re definitely acquainted.</p><p>The staff hovers, cordial and professional greetings are spoken, menus handed over shoulders, drink orders taken and filled. While Richter and Leslie are ordering, Quinton leans up and asks the rest of us, \u201cWe going out after?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard there\u2019s a cool blues place around here somewhere,\u201d Tadd answers.</p><p>MiShaun regards him skeptically. \u201cYou like blues?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like music, especially live music.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you play anything?\u201d She sips her sake.</p><p>\u201cI play guitar,\u201d he answers. \u201cJust enough to be dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGraham plays guitar,\u201d Brooke says then, and from my viewpoint it looks as though she follows this announcement up with a hand on his leg under the table. \u201cHe\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d I say quietly, leaning close to Emma\u2019s ear, \u201clooks like Brooke has decided on this film\u2019s prey.\u201d She looks confused, so I elaborate. \u201cYou know\u2014one guy from every film. I\u2019m not sure what the policy was on her little cable series.\u201d This is gossip, not fact, but hey, I didn\u2019t originate it.</p><p>Her voice is equally hushed. \u201cThat\u2019s, um, kind of sleazy.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Brooke sips a Japanese beer, her eyes narrowed at me. Emma tenses while Graham watches our t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate from across the table, his expression guarded.</p><p>\u201cNothing, nothing, keep your shirt on,\u201d I say. \u201cWe were just wondering who\u2019d be more dangerous with a guitar\u2014Tadd or Graham.\u201d</p><p>Brooke arches one brow and narrows her eyes even more. \u201cWhat\u2019s the verdict?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve never heard Graham play, so it\u2019s hardly something I can decide here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should stage a little competition in my room later,\u201d Brooke suggests. \u201cThey can both play for all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds cool,\u201d Tadd says. \u201cAlas, I didn\u2019t bring my guitar this trip. I forgot my laptop, extra contact lenses, hell, I barely remembered pants.\u201d Emma laughs softly next to me. She\u2019s so damned cute I can barely stand it.</p><p>\u201cYou can borrow Graham\u2019s,\u201d Brooke says, turning to ask Graham after the fact, \u201cIs that okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, no problem.\u201d He couldn\u2019t be more compliant. She must be sleeping with him. \u201cLet\u2019s call it a jam session, though, rather than a competition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, if there\u2019s no competition, you can\u2019t win,\u201d she adds, and I hear this comment with the gossip I just passed to Emma in mind.</p><p>\u201cWinning is overrated,\u201d he answers.</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Emma says, and Graham\u2019s eyes snap to hers.</p><p>Four? he mouths, and she shakes her head once, glaring but looking more like she\u2019s trying not to smile. Three, he mouths, and she rolls her eyes and mouths back fine.</p><p>Um, what? I glance at Brooke and see her thoughts are similar to mine, her eyes darting back and forth between them.</p><p>Emma and Graham don\u2019t look at each other again the rest of the meal.</p><p>Emma</p><p>Brooke suggests that we all raid our mini-bars of tiny liquor bottles so we can pool our resources. Her room, predictably, is the one I saw Graham enter my first night in Austin, less than a week ago, when I didn\u2019t know who he was. Now we\u2019re becoming friends, but he hasn\u2019t said a thing to me about Brooke.</p><p>I call Emily when I\u2019m changing in my room a couple of hours later. \u201cHe seems like a nice guy... and she seems like a junior Chloe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know him well enough to point out that kind of hazard. If they\u2019re just screwing around, and you guys are just friends\u2014you are just friends, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a guy, Em. They think differently than we do. You can bet a guy invented the whole friends-with-benefits thing. Though if Quinton Beauvier showed up at my door and said, \u2018Which way to your bedroom?\u2019 I\u2019d be like, \u2018Right this way!\u2019 But, you know, we wouldn\u2019t be friends. We\u2019d just be benefits.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. For all of her talk, Emily\u2019s the most guarded person I know when it comes to actually getting involved with a guy. Smart of her, because once she\u2019s involved, she\u2019s in all the way. She\u2019s had her heart shattered twice, and standing on the sidelines was the hardest thing ever for me. \u201cWell, at least you have your standards. I\u2019m putting you on speakerphone while I get dressed for the guitar hero challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you wearing to this little soiree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrooke suggested PJs.\u201d I toss the phone on the bed after hitting speakerphone and adjusting the volume.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys gonna do? And moreover, if all these hot guys are going to be there why was I not invited?\u201d</p><p>I groan. \u201cEmily, focus. I have no idea what the agenda is, beyond the guitar playing. I\u2019ve never been on a set with so many people in my age group. I\u2019ve always been pointedly excluded from cast get-togethers, what with me being a decade or several younger than everyone else.\u201d I stand in front of the mirror holding up a pink t-shirt and then a black tank top, back and forth. \u201cPlus you know if you were here, I\u2019d share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, you\u2019re forgiven. Got capri pj pants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I pull a pair out of a drawer and shake the creases out. \u201cThey\u2019re pink with black polka dots. Too babyish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, perfect. Pink and black are so retro lingerie, very chic. Slap your black tank on and you\u2019re ready to go.\u201d I pull the pants on, tie the drawstring loosely, and then pull the black tank over my head. Mirror check. Cute.</p><p>\u201cEmily, you\u2019re a genius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. Text me when you get back in your room, I want to know everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are such a gossip whore, Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, just be glad I\u2019m not asking you to set up a webcam... wait a minute, that\u2019s an idea...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Emily!\u201d I laugh, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cText me, text me, text me.\u201d Her disembodied voice comes from the bed. \u201cDo not forget!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t forget! You know I tell you everything. Miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss you, too.\u201d</p><p>As I pass Graham\u2019s room, he exits with his guitar in one hand and a standard-sized bottle of tequila in the other, which reminds me that my hands are empty. \u201cOh, I forgot\u2014\u201d I say, turning back.</p><p>\u201cCarry this.\u201d He hands me the tequila. \u201cShould be enough entry fee for both of us.\u201d He\u2019s wearing a different pair of drawstring pajama bottoms than the other night, paired with a heather gray t-shirt.</p><p>I\u2019m about to go into a room full of people near my age, all wearing pajamas and drinking. Cue a hearty dose of panic. \u201cWhat exactly are we doing?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cI assume Tadd and I are going to provide some musical entertainment. And then, I don\u2019t know. Sit around and talk, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Talk. Right.</p><p>Thanks to Emily, I didn\u2019t miss all of my high school experiences. I tagged along to enough parties with Em and her friends where there was a keg, or someone\u2019s parents didn\u2019t lock the liquor cabinet, or a fake ID was good enough to score a case of beer or a bottle of vodka. Talking isn\u2019t what people end up doing when they\u2019re young and plastered. But this is a small group, and we still have most of the film to shoot. Things can\u2019t get too out of hand or it will be insanely awkward.</p><p>We stop at Brooke\u2019s door and I take a deep breath. Graham touches my arm. \u201cHey, don\u2019t stress. I\u2019ll make sure you get to your room safe and sound. Well, safe and as sound as you can be if you have any of that.\u201d He points to the bottle in my hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll right.\u201d I\u2019m just hoping that me plus alcohol plus Reid Alexander in the same room won\u2019t equal potential humiliating candor.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d At my nod, Graham knocks, thunk-thunk, just as he did a few nights ago. Tadd opens the door, and Graham stands back, smiling down at me. \u201cLadies first.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>REID</p> <p>I got to Brooke\u2019s room first. When she opened the door, it was d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for about two seconds. And then not. Four years ago we would have been all over each other before I got five feet inside her room. Tonight, she just glared and backed up enough for me to enter. \u201cReid,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBrooke.\u201d I set several small bottles down on a table, keeping a couple and opening one, which I downed immediately. Tossing the bottle into her trash, I opened the second. \u201cSo how long has it been?\u201d I said, knowing this was a reckless path to navigate.</p><p>Her jaw tightened and she plopped onto the loveseat, trying to look indifferent and fearless at the same time, raising her chin and looking me in the eye. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>A knock sounded then and I turned, relieved, to admit MiShaun, Quinton and Jenna. A moment later, Tadd arrived.</p><p>Brooke holds court from the loveseat while MiShaun flips through the most recent Cosmo from the only chair. The rest of us lounge across the floor, chatting, while I wonder how disturbed I should be that Emma and Graham are the only two who haven\u2019t shown yet. Five minutes pass before they show up, together.</p> <p>\u201cThe prima donnas arrive,\u201d MiShaun teases.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, what took you guys so long?\u201d Brooke\u2019s eyes dart back and forth between the two of them.</p><p>Emma picks up on her territorial vibe and bristles visibly, her shoulders stiffening. \u201cI had a phone call to make.\u201d She holds out the bottle in her hand. \u201cUm, where\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut it with the other stuff.\u201d Brooke indicates a side table boasting a dozen miniature bottles. Emma hands the tequila to Quinton while Tadd lines up gift shop shot glasses with college emblems stamped on the sides. Smiling up at Graham, Brooke pats the cushion next to her, while Emma sits on the floor in the space between Jenna and me, exactly where I want her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s first, children?\u201d Brooke asks.</p><p>Tadd stands, places one hand over his heart and enunciates as though delivering a line from Hamlet. \u201cI require a dose of liquid courage for the challenge before me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI second that.\u201d Quinton pries the wrapper from the neck of the bottle Emma brought, which I suspect came via Graham, twists off the lid and begins pouring tequila shots.</p><p>Grabbing a bottle of rum from the stash and pouring it directly into her Diet Coke bottle, Brooke suggests we toast the success of the film, \u201cbefore we\u2019re all too hammered to remember what we\u2019re doing.\u201d Everyone obediently clinks glasses and bottles, murmuring to the film.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Meredith?\u201d Jenna asks.</p><p>\u201cThe boyfriend was waiting for her in the lobby when we got back from dinner.\u201d Brooke shrugs. \u201cLooks like splitsville to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, wait.\u201d Tadd is incredulous. \u201cThe guy showed up on set to break up with her? What a douche.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019s breaking up with who, just that it looked imminent. So, Mr. Wyler, what are you performing for our listening pleasure?\u201d she asks as Graham hands him the guitar.</p><p>\u201cEither Stairway to Heaven or some John Mayer,\u201d Tadd proposes, standing and picking out a few chords, testing the instrument.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s all you\u2019ve got, then definitely John Mayer. What are we, fifty?\u201d Brooke says.</p> <p>\u201cZeppelin is classic!\u201d he insists, which earns him a steady boo from the girls.</p><p>\u201cThe queen has spoken,\u201d I say, handing him a second shot of tequila, catching Brooke\u2019s eye and grinning as she seethes. She\u2019s determined to be pissed at anything I say or do; might as well enjoy it.</p><p>Tadd downs the shot, plunks the glass on a table and starts strumming, singing lines of Your Body is a Wonderland to each of the girls, strolling around the room and ending the performance perched on MiShaun\u2019s lap. As everyone applauds, he bows and passes the guitar to Graham.</p><p>\u201cGraham, no Zeppelin, as I believe we\u2019ve already established,\u201d Brooke says.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d do something I\u2019ve been working on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething you wrote yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill a work in progress, but, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d She touches his arm lightly, and I bump Emma lightly and raise both eyebrows in the universal gesture of do you see that?</p><p>Graham slides to the edge of the loveseat and starts playing, the chords complicated, his fingers moving over the neck of the guitar like he\u2019s caressing it. The vocals are definitely good. Unlike Tadd, he doesn\u2019t look at anyone while performing, except once, towards the end of the last chorus, when his eyes meet Emma\u2019s for a split second. I move from guarded dislike to I hate this guy.</p><p>When he finishes, everyone erupts into applause. He and Tadd trade sets while the rest of us sip whatever poison we\u2019ve decided to utilize, and Quinton suggests a drinking game.</p><p>Brooke explains the rules to Jenna, who\u2019s never played. \u201cThis game has two objects: we learn stupid stuff about each other, and everyone gets wasted.\u201d She scoots off the loveseat, taking Graham\u2019s hand and pulling him down. \u201cTadd will start by saying, \u2018Never have I ever,\u2019 followed by something he\u2019s never done. Anyone who has done whatever it is has to take a drink. Girls, we can handicap ourselves by taking half-shots.\u201d</p><p>The first Never Have I Ever that pops into my head involves Emma, and isn\u2019t one I can say aloud. Besides, I intend for it to be invalid by the end of the week, if not the end of the night.</p><p>Emma</p><p>Quinton pours out shots as Tadd supplies the first never-done thing. \u201cNever have I ever... been an only child.\u201d</p><p>Reid and I each down our glasses, and as the tequila blazes a path down my throat, I gasp. I\u2019ve never been much of a drinker. During the parties I attended with Emily, we pretended to drink more than we actually drank.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a good start for us.\u201d He grins as my eyes tear. \u201cThat, or it\u2019s an awesome start.\u201d He leans the length of his arm against mine for a moment, his skin a couple of shades darker, his forearm chiseled, the fine blond hairs raising goosebumps where we touch. \u201cAre you cold?\u201d He runs a finger along my arm, multiplying them.</p><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d I don\u2019t want to admit that I have goosebumps all over my body, that my stomach has just gone end-over-end due to his proximity and attention. He moves closer until our sides are pressing together. Oh yeah. That\u2019s gonna help.</p><p>\u201cNever have I ever bungee-jumped,\u201d Jenna says.</p><p>\u201cWell, crap.\u201d MiShaun throws back her half-shot, along with Tadd.</p><p>\u201cFar be it from me to suggest you wear more to warm up.\u201d Reid\u2019s warm breath stirs the baby hairs behind my ear, his smile hungry after a glance towards the just-low-enough neckline of my tank. Thank you, Emily.</p><p>My turn. \u201cNever have I ever sung on stage.\u201d I know I\u2019ll be in the minority in this room full of film and theatre types.</p><p>\u201cDiabolical,\u201d Reid says, his voice a low hum, admiration in the smirk he gives me before he joins everyone else in another shot. The beginnings of a buzz make my head swim, and I fight not to sway towards him like a magnet towards a steel bar.</p><p>Reid turns to the room, aware that it\u2019s his turn even if I\u2019m aware of little beyond him. \u201cNever have I ever... kissed a guy.\u201d All four girls roll our eyes and down our half-shots, and I realize I\u2019m on my way to a colossal hangover. Good thing there\u2019s no filming tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cWay to out me right away, dude.\u201d Tadd throws back his shot, smiling wickedly. \u201cAnd let me know if you want me to fix that for you.\u201d</p><p>Graham downs his shot as well. \u201cDamned independent films,\u201d he growls good-naturedly as Quinton hoots with laughter.</p><p>\u201cNever have I ever eaten lobster.\u201d Quinton says, and everyone in the room grabs their shot glasses.</p><p>Tadd makes a \u201cT\u201d with his hands. \u201cTime out, time out, that can\u2019t be true, I call bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong game, baby. Chill.\u201d MiShaun tousles his pale, poker-straight hair.</p><p>Brooke waits until Tadd curses once and drinks. \u201cNever have I ever been in love,\u201d she says, staring at Reid. He stares back, neither moving. Graham takes a drink, watching me. I\u2019m not sure what being in love feels like, but I sense that what I felt for Justin from Newark, or certainly anyone else since him, wasn\u2019t it. I don\u2019t drink.</p><p>\u201cNever have I ever been to Hawaii,\u201d Graham says. I\u2019m the only person who doesn\u2019t drink, and he smiles at me from the opposite side of the circle. Hawaii is where my father and Chloe honeymooned.</p><p>\u201cNever have I ever\u2014\u201d MiShaun pauses for effect, \u201cplayed this stupid game before.\u201d She clinks glasses with Jenna while everyone else takes a drink.</p><p>Tadd admits that never has he ever learned to ride a bicycle, and everyone else groans and downs a shot before Jenna admits that she\u2019s never learned to swim.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Brooke downs her half-shot. \u201cWe need to get you out to the pool. What if you land a part in a film where you have to dive into a lake, and come up wet and sexy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThass a good point.\u201d Jenna chews her lip.</p><p>\u201cWet and sexy? Really?\u201d Quinton fans himself with the discarded Cosmo. \u201cDoes everybody need to be able to pop outta the water looking like your Life\u2019s a Beach poster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I\u2019m well-qualified to teach that sk-skill.\u201d Brooke\u2019s poster was issued the month she turned eighteen. She stands in calf-deep surf, holding a surf board and clad in a wetsuit, unzipped to mid-chest, with her finger through the zipper pull as though she\u2019s still unzipping. Emily\u2019s brother has it prominently displayed in his bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be willing to assist with that worthy cause,\u201d Quinton says, lying back on the carpet. \u201cBe sure to let me know when lessons commence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll send you a memo,\u201d Brooke says.</p><p>By the time we get back around to Tadd, we\u2019re stumbling over each other\u2019s names and any words containing more than one syllable, the slip-ups seeming beyond hilarious. Graham is more subdued than the other guys, his smile easy and genuine at the silliness around him. I catch his dark eyes on me a couple of times, but he watches Brooke, too.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make this more interesting,\u201d Tadd says, leaning back on his elbows. He waits until everyone is quiet. \u201cNever have I ever... hooked up with a costar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold up. Are we talking hooked up or hooked up,\u201d Quinton asks. \u201c\u2019Cause I do not believe for a second that your horn dog self hasn\u2019t found a twin on a set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither. Let\u2019s say the make-out hook-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You are ly-ing,\u201d Quinton says.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Tadd crosses his heart. \u201cI\u2019m pure as the driven whatever, on location. But don\u2019t worry\u2014one of the extras is on my list of things to do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>MiShaun swats Tadd\u2019s head too gently to be much of a reprimand. When everyone drinks, including Jenna, there\u2019s a shocked silence before the room is filled with laughter and Quinton leans across to high-five her as she blushes red. Tadd eyes her blearily. \u201cYou are an enigma,\u201d he means to say, though what comes out sounds more like you are an enema. We laugh until our sides hurt; Quinton laughs so hard he\u2019s crying.</p><p>Next to me, Reid\u2019s gaze sweeps slowly from my face to my breasts, over the ribbon tie at my waist, to my pink toenails and back up. I want to know how he feels about me\u2014not just my body (when he\u2019s drunk and paying attention), but me. After our scenes this week, I was reduced to mush, and he ignored me at the club. I should be pissed. Which proves to be impossible when my head is spinning and he is sitting right next to me, looking so crazy gorgeous.</p><p>Balls. The tequila caught up with me quickly.</p><p>\u201cWhat should I do with you, Emma Pierce?\u201d He\u2019s inches away, his mouth turned up on one side, his eyes slate blue in the dim light of the room.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you wanna do?\u201d I flirt back.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d His eyes are locked on mine, and I feel the vibrations to my toes. \u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, immediately wishing I hadn\u2019t. The effects of the tequila are building, even though I started cheating half an hour ago, feigning shots. My thoughts spin along with my vision. I close my eyes for a moment, and hear Reid\u2019s soft laugh.</p><p>Oh, man. I can\u2019t let everything move this fast with Reid; I\u2019m not sure yet what he wants. Correction. I\u2019m pretty sure what he wants, but I don\u2019t know what it means. The hot/cold game is confusing. Is he trying to slow it down? Does he regularly hook up during films? Is a hookup what I want, if it\u2019s all I can get with him? I\u2019m far too buzzed to think clearly.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s play spin-the-bottle,\u201d Quinton suggests. \u201cOr seven minutes in heaven. We can use the balcony.\u201d</p> <p>MiShaun stands. \u201cThis is where I call old lady privilege, children.\u201d She zigzags across the floor to the door, waving off protests. \u201cI\u2019ve done junior high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiShaun, I think you\u2019re just afraid to kiss me,\u201d Tadd says.</p><p>She turns, one hand on the curve of her hip. \u201cAnd you may be right.\u201d</p><p>As she leaves the room, Tadd quips, \u201cI believe I\u2019ve just been insulted.\u201d</p><p>Graham\u2019s eyes meet mine, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s no way he remembers what he promised me several hours ago until he stands, stretching. \u201cI\u2019m beat. And just so you know, Tadd, I\u2019m not afraid to kiss you.\u201d He picks up his guitar. Like a postscript, he turns and adds, \u201cEmma, you said something about running in the morning?\u201d reaching a hand down to me. I link my hand with his and he pulls me up. The room tilts back and forth, but he holds my wrist firmly. Half a minute later, we\u2019re in the hallway walking towards our rooms, one of us less steadily than the other.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m weird, but those kissing games feel so awkward.\u201d My words slur together\u2014kissygameshfeelsawkward\u2014which makes me giggle.</p> <p>He passes his door, his warm hand at my waist, keeping me from bumping into walls or falling down. \u201cI agree. I\u2019d rather control who I kiss than leave it to fate and an empty bottle,\u201d he says softly, taking my key, unlocking my door and pushing it open.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t ready to go out onto the balcony with... well. I mean, we\u2019re all kinda smashed. Balconies aren\u2019t safe. Somebody could fall over the edge. Or something.\u201d I lean against the open door, a blush creeping up my neck.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it might have been me you ended up with out there, not him,\u201d I look up at him then\u2014his brown eyes so dark they\u2019re nearly black as he teases me about seven minutes we might have shared on Brooke\u2019s balcony, doing... who knows what.</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>He hands the key card back to me and smiles. \u201cGoodnight, Emma.\u201d</p><p>He turns back to his room, and I watch until he unlocks his door and pushes it open. \u201cEmma?\u201d he calls softly as I stumble into my room.</p><p>I catch my door before it closes, my heartbeat drumming in my ears, and answer without looking around the corner. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s definitely four.\u201d He\u2019s chuckling as his door closes with a click.</p> <p>Chapter 13</p><p>REID</p><p>Emma and Graham are gone before I can react, thanks to the number of shots I\u2019ve had. With exception of that one look between them, he seemed focused on Brooke all night, so the idea that he\u2019d leap up and take Emma with him at some point was out of nowhere.</p><p>Tadd gets to his feet unsteadily after a quick glance between Brooke and me. \u201cQuinton, help me get this baby into her room.\u201d He gestures to Jenna, who\u2019s curled up asleep on the floor. We\u2019ve successfully set a fifteen-year-old on the road to corruption, as others did for each of us. Tadd nudges her semi-awake and he and Quinton each take one of her arms. \u201cThank God she weighs as much as a postage stamp,\u201d Tadd says, propping her up.</p><p>Quinton closes his eyes, steadying himself with one arm around Jenna. \u201cI\u2019m going to hate myself in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you now, man. I still don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve never had lobster.\u201d</p><p>They both laugh, weaving towards the door, Jenna barely conscious between them.</p><p>\u201cG\u2019night. You two behave,\u201d Tadd leers at Brooke and me, eyebrows raised, as the three of them stumble into the hallway.</p><p>The door closes behind them and we sit, staring at each other across the expanse of carpet. Neither of us says anything for a couple of minutes.</p><p>Finally, I incline my head towards her bed. \u201cOnce, for old times\u2019 sake?\u201d</p><p>Incredulous, she blinks, measuring how serious I am. Given that Emma just left the room with Graham, Brooke is drunk and looking hot and doable, and we\u2019re in her room alone, I\u2019m game if she is. For a few seconds\u2014one, two, three\u2014I think she might be. And then she shuts it down. \u201cNot on your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo serious and bitter.\u201d My mouth twists in amusement. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so bad.\u201d</p><p>She gasps lightly, her mouth a small \u201cO\u201d as she blinks, and again, before she shutters it, there\u2019s more naked emotion in her face than I thought she possessed. She gains control of it quickly, her eyes locked to mine. And then she crawls across the ten feet of space between us, onto my lap, straddling me, her knees at my hips. Kissing me, at first softly and then hard, like punishment, she wraps her arms around my neck, her nails piercing the skin through my t-shirt as her fingers rake across my shoulders and she grinds her pelvis against mine. Despite the alcohol in my blood, my body responds, though perhaps because of the alcohol in my blood, I don\u2019t realize what she\u2019s doing.</p><p>Without warning she recoils and slides off my lap, forcing my hands away from where they grip her waist. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so good, either.\u201d Her tone is disinterested and her smile, glacial. She pushes herself upright and walks an erratic path to her bathroom, dismissing me. \u201cYou can go now, Reid. I want nothing from you.\u201d</p><p>I stand and laugh, watch how her shoulders tighten at the sound. \u201cRight. I forgot for a moment what a cold bitch you are, Brooke. I remember now. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not nearly as difficult to leave as you assume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d she says as I pull the door open. I chuckle as it shuts behind me, seemingly unaffected.</p><p>When I get to my room it takes every effort of restraint not to put a hole through the goddamned wall. Brooke was my first, and I was hers. We were young and stupid and for a brief space in time, I thought I loved her. I hadn\u2019t, of course, any more than she loved me. As much as I wish I was unaffected by her, that\u2019s impossible. No reason I can\u2019t conceal it, though.</p><p>Emma</p><p>While the room spins, I lie across the bed, calculating how many shots I had tonight. Definitely more than I\u2019ve done before in one sitting. Running in the morning is out of the question; so much for new good habits. I remember to text Emily just before my battery dies, though the message is probably an incomprehensible jumble of letters, since the buttons on my phone keep shuffling.</p><p>I wake to a tapping noise and at first I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s coming from inside my head. I crack an eye open. My mouth feels like someone has wallpapered it with felt. Tap-tap-tap. Nope, definitely the door. The clock on the nightstand says it\u2019s not quite ten a.m.</p><p>On my toes, I peer out the peephole. I unlock the door, open it a sliver and squint in the bright hallway lighting. \u201cGraham?\u201d</p><p>He holds up a lidded cup with a Starbucks label and smiles. \u201cGo brush your teeth and splash some water on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGraham, I look, and feel, like shit.\u201d</p><p>He slips into my room. \u201cGo on, it\u2019ll help. How do you take your coffee?\u201d He walks to the desk with the coffees, pulling packets of sugar and cream out of his pockets.</p><p>I sigh, unable to argue with a head full of cotton. \u201cGimme the works.\u201d Obediently, I go into the bathroom and close the door behind me. I wash my face, brush my teeth, and pull my hair into a ponytail, avoiding the mirror as much as possible while doing so, which isn\u2019t too difficult since my eyes refuse to open fully.</p><p>When I come out, he hands me the cup.</p><p>\u201cHow are you up, and feeling this\u2014\u201d I snap my fingers \u201c\u2014this... what\u2019s the word...\u201d I gesture towards him, then rub my eyes and sit on the bed.</p><p>\u201cUnhungover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I outweigh you by at least seventy pounds. That\u2019s pretty much the secret.\u201d He moves a pair of shoes from the desk chair to the floor and sits down.</p><p>\u201cSo you never get hungover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that. But I took it easy last night while everyone else got plastered with the help of high school party games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t have any fun, huh?\u201d I say, taking a sip and closing my eyes.</p><p>\u201cLast night was fun in its own way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>He watches me, sipping his coffee and sitting back with one foot resting on top of the opposite knee. \u201cMmm. I\u2019d like to know what you thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just glad we didn\u2019t play spin-the-bottle or... well, I\u2019m not a fan of the whole, uh, kissing game concept...\u201d</p><p>He sips his coffee, considering. \u201cYeah, me neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought guys liked those kinds of games.\u201d</p><p>His lashes sweep down, hiding his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not really a games sorta guy.\u201d I think about that while he sips his coffee, and then, in what I\u2019m starting to realize is a typical maneuver for him, he changes the subject completely. \u201cThink you might be up for brunch and some shopping?\u201d</p><p>A guy who wants to shop? \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to lure me into a sporting goods place or a comic book store, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking bookstore. But if you\u2019re into comics...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please. Bookstore yes; comics no.\u201d I briefly dated a guy last year who was into comics. He never stopped talking about them, even when I threatened to start talking about Gilmore Girls reruns. I know more about comic books than any girl ever wants to know. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFinish your coffee, get ready, and I\u2019ll be back in, say, forty-five minutes?\u201d He stands and moves towards the door.</p><p>As I shower, I realize that Graham completely sidestepped my question about his comment that last night was \u201cfun in its own way.\u201d I\u2019m definitely not running on all cylinders, as my father would say.</p><p>My phone is recharged and flashing when I get out. There\u2019s a text from Emily answering what I sent her last night:</p><p>Me: er oksyrf * becer smf o ;rgy brfpre dpom tnr vorrle</p> <p>Em: I assume, from your text, that drinking was involved. Hello? Something I can READ???</p><p>I text her back and she answers immediately.</p><p>Me: Sorry, tequila attack. The keypad kept moving around.</p><p>Em: You promised to tell all.

Calling you.</p><p>\u201cYou guys seriously didn\u2019t play I never and spin-the-bottle did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and almost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow I\u2019ve always pictured celebrity parties as more... sophisticated?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cYeah, me too. I left when Quinton suggested spin-the-bottle or seven minutes in heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you insane? There was a possibility of seven minutes in heaven with Quinton Beauvier, and you left early?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEm, you know how I feel about those games...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I just don\u2019t see why I can\u2019t body-double for you during times like this! It would be a grueling task, but I\u2019d make the sacrifice for you.\u201d</p><p>I recognize Graham\u2019s one-knuckle thunk-thunk at the door.</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m about to go to brunch, so I\u2019ll call you later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Don\u2019t worry about me. All by myself in boring Sacramento. Alone. No life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily, you know you\u2019re always with me in spirit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite me,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanna be with you in person playing spin-the-bottle with Reid and Quinton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow who\u2019s whining?\u201d I tease.</p> <p>\u201cFine. But one of these days, I expect to reap the benefits of having a big star for a best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. You\u2019ll be first in line.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>REID</p><p>I wake up just before noon and call room service for coffee, then my voicemail to retrieve a message received early this morning from Dad. Like he didn\u2019t know I\u2019d still be asleep when he called.</p><p>I got charged with pot possession earlier this summer, and he\u2019s avoided communicating with me directly since then. I was at a party, passing a couple of joints around with some people when John texted me this:</p><p>John: pass the joint to the girl next to you and walk to the back door NOW</p><p>While John may lack anything resembling judgment, he always knows what\u2019s going down. So I obeyed. He pulled me into the alley where his girl du jour was waiting with her car, just as the police came in the front door. There were photos of me smoking, but it was dark, and they were too indistinct to be incontestably me, or weed, for that matter. With no physical evidence to prove that I was present or in possession, Dad\u2019s firm claimed hearsay and the case was thrown out... which didn\u2019t preclude Dad from going ballistic.</p><p>We pitched a fortune at my PR firm to ward off the tarnish to my image. The money came straight from my account, but for some reason, who paid for what wasn\u2019t a viable argument. My straight-laced father has never stepped out of line in his life, and as he\u2019s expressed stridently on multiple occasions, he can\u2019t comprehend why I live my life the way I do.</p><p>I assumed his message would involve some account information I needed, or a contract I forgot to sign that he\u2019s overnighting. So I don\u2019t expect this: \u201cReid,\u201d he sighs heavily, \u201cI\u2019m calling to let you know that your mother has decided to check into a rehab program.\u201d He doesn\u2019t say again but it hangs there, unsaid, nevertheless. \u201cExclusive facility, by the ocean, not too far from home. She\u2019ll get good care. Ninety day program. She hopes to be back home for the holidays, possibly before you\u2019re done filming.\u201d</p><p>He goes silent for several seconds, and I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the end. Then he adds, \u201cShe\u2019ll be able to take phone calls in a couple of weeks. I\u2019ll let you know the number, in case you... have time to call her. Just don\u2019t... say anything upsetting.\u201d He has a lot of nerve saying that. I\u2019m usually not the one who upsets her. \u201cIf you have any questions, call me. Otherwise... well. Call if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>Awesome.</p><p>I should have seen her rock-bottom coming. Even though I was seldom around, she had a drink in her hand every time I was. With the exception of when I was really young, and for short, varying periods of time after any rehab experience, this is how I picture her: Mom, drink in hand. It\u2019s her prop, part of her costume. Sometimes I wonder if her despondency stems from trying to be something she isn\u2019t\u2014someone constantly sober, without the ability to dull the knife-thrusts of reality. Maybe Mom-with-a-drink-in-her-hand is who she really is, and thinking that it\u2019s immoral or makes her a bad person is what causes the crisis.</p><p>Or maybe I\u2019m a classic enabler, as one of her therapists yelled in a fit of untherapist-like vocal exasperation.</p><p>Or maybe I look in the mirror every day and am scared as shit that I\u2019ll see either of my parents looking back at me.</p><p>Emma</p><p>\u201cThanks again for the coffee.\u201d Graham and I are walking along 6th street. He\u2019s shortened his stride to match mine, like he does when we run. \u201cThat was nice. Otherwise, I\u2019d still be hiding under my pillows, feeling like I just ate a dirty t-shirt.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cA dirty t-shirt? That\u2019s... disgustingly descriptive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisgustingly fitting, unfortunately.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s walking with his hands in his pockets, and he bumps my arm lightly with his elbow. \u201cSo you think I\u2019m nice, huh? Maybe I\u2019m actually a complete jerk with ulterior motives.\u201d</p><p>I tap my lip with a finger, peering at him. \u201cYou\u2019d have to be a nefarious individual with seriously evil intentions, to bring me coffee and be a jerk at heart.\u201d</p><p>He looks down at me, eyebrows raised. Out here in the sunlight his eyes, while still dark, seem more deep caramel, less onyx. His hair has a reddish tint in the sunlight, too, something completely invisible inside. It\u2019s like being outdoors turns his color dial a notch or two lighter.</p><p>\u201cGood deducing. And use of the word nefarious,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially with the hangover and all.\u201d</p><p>The day is warm already. I assumed as much, and dressed in shorts and the pink t-shirt I\u2019d left on the bed last night in favor of the black tank. I grabbed my red canvas Chucks instead of flip-flops, since I had no idea just how much walking Graham had in mind. Good thing, too, because we\u2019ve walked about a hundred blocks by now.</p><p>\u201cHow much farther?\u201d The good news is I may actually feel like having brunch at some point in the near future. The bad news is I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re planning on walking to the next county first.</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019re a suburbs sort of girl. I grew up in New York City\u2014lots of walking. This feels like nothing.\u201d This guy is a freaking master at dodging questions.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m a lazy suburbian girl... who, lest we forget, is suffering from a killer hangover because I don\u2019t weigh a hundred pounds more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeventy. And I hate to tell you, but\u2014\u201d He takes my shoulders and turns me, guiding me up a pathway to the front door of the restaurant, located in a renovated old house. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>I give him a haughty look. \u201cIn that case, I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to kick your ass, since I\u2019m too pooped from walking a thousand miles for that type of exertion.\u201d He smiles and shakes his head, pulling the door open for me.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, I\u2019m eating the fluffiest blueberry muffin ever made and mumbling an apology. \u201cSorry about the cranky.\u201d</p><p>He forks a bite of omelet, dabs it into the pool of salsa he poured on one side of his plate, and sticks it in his mouth. Chewing, he appears puzzled. \u201cWhat cranky?\u201d He lines up another bite. \u201cOh, you mean when you looked like you were about to stage a mutiny for having to walk a couple of blocks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple? It was at least fifteen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNuh-uh.\u201d I was certain it was closer to twenty.</p><p>\u201cYep. Ten exactly.\u201d</p><p>God, I\u2019m in worse shape than I thought. \u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s five,\u201d he says, before I even have time to hear myself and cringe.</p><p>\u201cKnow-it-all.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cWould you rather be in your room, buried under your pillows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I sound like a sullen toddler. Sipping my chicory-flavored coffee, I relax, and the house seems to sigh with me, the refinished wood floors creaking as a waiter walks by with a full tray over his head. \u201cThis place is great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold ya.\u201d</p><p>After brunch we backtrack and spend a couple of hours at the bookstore. There\u2019s a puppet show going on in the kids\u2019 area, and he insists we sit on the floor and watch. This is when I learn that Graham and his older sisters used to make sock puppets and put on shows for their parents. This whole idea is so foreign to me that I\u2019m sure he\u2019s making it up. On the walk back to the hotel, I ask him what kinds of shows.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d make puppets of ourselves, or our favorite book characters, like Where the Wild Things Are, gluing on wiggly eyeballs and yarn.\u201d I try to imagine a sock puppet Graham. \u201cOne time we made penguins, coloring popsicle sticks like lightsabers and hot gluing those to the flippers, and then we did a Star Wars reenactment for my Dad\u2019s birthday. He loves penguins, and anything Star Wars.\u201d</p><p>Penguins puppets with lightsabers? There\u2019s no way he could make this up.</p><p>\u201cSo according to one of the shots you tossed back last night, you\u2019re an only child,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat was that like\u2014being the center of attention all the time?\u201d</p><p>My first thought is that after my mother died, I felt more like the invisible kid than the center of attention. And then I begin stressing about how I\u2019m going to talk about my mother being dead. The subject of family always, sooner or later, brings the story of my mom forward. There\u2019s no simple way to say it, no way to fully express everything those two words mean to me: she died. The feelings are muted most of the time, something only accomplished by the passing of time, but they\u2019ll never go away. I know that now. There are moments I wish the pain would disappear, but mostly, it\u2019s a comforting ache. I lost her, and I feel it\u2014sometimes like a bruise that doesn\u2019t hurt until it\u2019s pressed, sometimes like a knife.</p><p>\u201cI bet you were spoiled rotten,\u201d Graham says, slowing at the window of a narrow storefront of skateboards and boarding gear.</p><p>\u201cI seem like a brat?\u201d I pout, ruining any defense against it.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that. But I can picture you as a little girl: adorable, no one else around to steal the spotlight. That\u2019s all it would take to wrap your parents around your little finger. I mean at that point it\u2019s self-preservation, right? Darwin\u2019s lesser-known theory: survival of the cutest.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I smile, willing myself not to blush. \u201cI guess I don\u2019t really know if I was spoiled or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. I was the youngest, and a little monster. Or so I hear from my sisters.\u201d</p><p>He has no idea how relieved I am that we\u2019ve strayed from talking about my family. \u201cBut aren\u2019t they disqualified from judging, as your competition for attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think... but my mother agrees with them.\u201d</p> <p>Examining hand-made jewelry through a store window, I\u2019m caught off guard and can\u2019t stifle a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible!\u201d</p><p>He shrugs as though resigned. \u201cThere are allegations of extreme tattling, tantrums and cookie hoarding. But don\u2019t ask for details. I plead the fifth.\u201d His phone beeps and he pulls it from his pocket, reading the text and typing a quick response.</p><p>\u201cI have a career-related question,\u201d I say, after we walk for a minute in silence. \u201cWhat made you want to play Bill Collins? Have you read Pride and Prejudice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read it after I was up for the audition. I could say Collins is a complex character and playing him will widen my range, but honestly, I\u2019m supporting myself as an actor. If my agent recommends a role and I get it, I do it. Being too picky would be economic suicide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d I stick my tongue out at him when he smiles and holds up six fingers, which makes him laugh.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about you? Why Lizbeth Bennet?\u201d His phone rings and he glances at the display. \u201cOh\u2014I\u2019ve gotta take this. Can we\u2014?\u201d I nod and he steps out of the path of foot traffic. \u201cHello?\u201d I gesture to let him know I\u2019m walking on to the hotel, half a block away. He nods before turning, his voice warm, happy. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m here, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>When I reach the hotel entrance, I look back. He\u2019s moved to the edge of the sidewalk and is slipping his lighter back in his pocket, laughing, a cigarette dangling from his fingers.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>REID</p><p>After ordering a room service breakfast at noon, I text Tadd and Quinton to see what\u2019s on tap for tonight, knowing I might not hear from either of them for hours. I have the barest excuse of a hangover this morning; it should be worse. I think my adrenaline during and after the exchange with Brooke burned off most of my buzz. The last thing I need tonight is more of her. A guys night out is in order.</p><p>The more I think about Emma and Graham\u2019s exit last night, the more premeditated it seems, at least on his side. I haven\u2019t figured him out yet. He\u2019s unanticipated competition for Emma, considering how he\u2019s hanging around Brooke, too. Frankly, I\u2019m not used to having to compete for a chick at all. I should probably find it refreshing. I don\u2019t.</p> <p>Tadd calls half an hour later. \u201cFirst, goddamn it don\u2019t let me drink that much again, and second, I\u2019m up for guys night out. But I warn you, if I get lucky, it may turn into guys night in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. I\u2019ll text Quinton... I don\u2019t have Graham\u2019s number, but I assume we\u2019re inviting him.\u201d No way I want him left here with Emma down the hall.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s next door to me; I\u2019ll pop over and ask.\u201d</p><p>Perfect. I get the feeling Graham would suspect an invitation coming from me; I can\u2019t imagine that Brooke has kept her opinions of me to herself. I knew we hadn\u2019t left things on congenial terms, but I had no idea she\u2019d be that hostile. \u201cCool. Eight? Nine?\u201d</p><p>Tadd does a hangover groan. \u201cNine. We\u2019ve got tomorrow off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Bob and let him know we\u2019ll need a bodyguard and a car, possibly separate cars on the way back.\u201d I\u2019m bringing somebody back with me, that\u2019s for damned sure. Emma is proving more elusive than I expected her to be, and I need someone to take the edge off.</p><p>When we meet downstairs at nine, Bob and Jeff are waiting to usher us to a car. Tadd comes down last. Alone.</p><p>\u201cIs Graham meeting us later?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe said he\u2019s staying in tonight.\u201d</p><p>I pull to a stop in the middle of the lobby. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he\u2019s still recovering from last night and he\u2019s going to stay in.\u201d Liar. He was the least drunk person in the room last night. Tadd bumps me and keeps walking. \u201cCome on, dude. What\u2019s the big deal? Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I have no choice but to follow. The paparazzi are handled deftly by Bob and Jeff and two minutes later we\u2019re in the car heading to a martini bar Tadd heard about.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the girls doing?\u201d That didn\u2019t come out as offhand as I\u2019d intended, but luckily Tadd doesn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cI ran into Brooke and Meredith earlier\u2014they were planning a girls-only night. Brooke looked as relieved to have a night off from you as you look about a night off from her.\u201d He has the nerve to smirk that I\u2019m relieved to know where Emma\u2019s going to be tonight. Wow. This is already way more high-maintenance than I\u2019m used to.</p><p>Quinton leans up. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on between you two anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, man.\u201d I share a quick look with Tadd and shrug. \u201cWe had a thing, like years ago, and she\u2019s apparently not over it.\u201d</p><p>Quinton bumps my fist with his, grinning. \u201cHere\u2019s to always leaving them wanting more.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t tell him that wanting more is not exactly what\u2019s between Brooke and me.</p><p>Emma</p><p>My hangover is gone, but I need a quiet evening. I was planning on a long talk with Emily, but she has a date with a guy who works at Abercrombie, a few doors down from Hot Topic, where she works. (I pointed out that this scenario contains serious odd-couple potential, which she didn\u2019t appreciate as much as I did.) She\u2019s been through a long dry spell, and the possibility of starting her senior year with no boyfriend and no prospects is \u201cintolerable.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s more to my recuperation plan than ditching the lingering headache. My father and Chloe are arriving tomorrow and will be in Austin for five days. I\u2019ll need my strength to deal with both the grueling filming schedule and the stress of having her that close at the same time. It\u2019s too much to hope that she\u2019ll recede to the background. Chloe doesn\u2019t do background.</p><p>I\u2019ve excused myself from tonight\u2019s Austin nightlife tour\u2014guys in one group, girls in the other. Room service delivers a spinach salad and the television plays music videos, volume low. Feeling restless, I wander onto the tiny balcony that overlooks the street and lean on the stone railing, staring at the big black sky, where I can only make out a few of the brightest stars. Downtown is too illuminated for star-gazing. People mill around below, and even this far up, I catch jumbled bits of conversation and laughter. And a trace of tobacco?</p><p>\u201cEmma, hey.\u201d Graham is two balconies over, straightening from the railing, smoking. His eyes, meeting mine, are black with the darkness and distance. He takes a drag, the tip of the cigarette glowing red near his silhouette in the dim light from the streetlamps and headlights below.</p><p>\u201cHey, yourself. I assumed you\u2019d gone out with the guys.\u201d</p><p>A momentary breeze kicks up, and he shakes the hair out of his eyes, exhales a trail of smoke that dissipates in all directions. \u201cI decided to opt out tonight.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>He takes another drag and resumes his posture of leaning on the railing, staring down at the swirls of color and noise at street level. He doesn\u2019t speak again, and though I\u2019m curious about the call that interrupted our earlier conversation, I can\u2019t think of a casual way to ask about it. I walk back into my room without interrupting his thoughts. I consider hauling one of the cushy chairs out onto the balcony to read, but if Graham is still outside, it might be awkward.</p><p>After perusing the dessert menu and convincing myself not to order a slice of double chocolate cake, I grab the novel I bought this morning and settle on the bed. My stomach growls in protest, unshushed when I mumble, \u201cShut up.\u201d Opening the book, I feel the familiar brush of pleasure\u2014the crackle of the pages and the binding, the inky smell. And then I nearly jump out of my skin when the phone on the nightstand rings at full volume.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I answer, heart pounding, looking for the sound control switch.</p><p>\u201cEmma? It\u2019s Graham. I, uh, don\u2019t have your cell number...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo... I ordered this chocolate cake from room service, and it\u2019s even more monstrous than it looked in the menu... and I was thinking we could share it. If you want. I understand if you\u2019d rather be alone, though.\u201d</p><p>I smile, having planned for an evening of precisely that, just as I\u2019d originally planned to run alone every morning. \u201cI just convinced myself that I didn\u2019t need that cake... But I guess if I share yours, it won\u2019t really count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I\u2019ll be down in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could order up coffee?\u201d Because that\u2019s what I need at nearly 10 p.m. when I had intentions of going to bed early\u2014coffee.</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>I call room service and then run to the bathroom and brush my teeth. I have just enough time to sweep on lip balm before Graham taps lightly on the door. When I unbolt and open it, he\u2019s holding two forks and the most massive slice of cake I\u2019ve ever seen. \u201cWow. That thing is enormous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s basically an entire cake.\u201d He runs a hand through his hair and a couple of strands towards the middle stick straight up. He\u2019s barefoot, wearing jeans and a worn t-shirt inscribed with the name of an indie band I vaguely recognize. Emily would know it.</p><p>We drag the chairs and one nightstand out onto the balcony, where we sip coffee and eat from opposite sides of the cake without dividing it. The muffled din of Saturday night floats up from the street below. After a few minutes of clinking forks and sighs of contentment, Graham asks what made me want to play Lizbeth Bennet, returning to this afternoon\u2019s conversation as though the interruption occurred moments ago, rather than hours.</p><p>\u201cWhat girl wouldn\u2019t want to do an adaptation of Pride and Prejudice?\u201d I hedge.</p><p>\u201cShe said mysteriously,\u201d he returns, one eyebrow raised. He takes another sip of coffee, waiting, slouching into the chair, turning more fully towards me, his long legs extended.</p><p>I pull my knees up into my chair, angling to face him. \u201cWell, like most girls in the English-speaking world, I adore Elizabeth Bennet. She\u2019s the ultimate heroine, strong-willed and independent, intelligent, loyal, but at the same time, she\u2019s not flawless, she\u2019s not above mistakes, or falling in love.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cSo as soon as you knew about the film, you wanted to do it?\u201d</p><p>Wow, he\u2019s good.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. I mean, it isn\u2019t Elizabeth Bennet, after all. It\u2019s Lizbeth, this Americanized version. And some of the screenplay lines... I guess I\u2019m a purist about some things, and Jane Austen is one of those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. So when did you first read Pride and Prejudice?\u201d</p><p>Here we go. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It was my mother\u2019s favorite book. I remember her reading it aloud to me when I was very young.\u201d My stomach pitches and I blame the sugary cake and caffeine-laden coffee, when the origin of this uneasiness is all too familiar. I evade this discussion whenever possible. I could do that now, with Graham, but I\u2019m not going to. I want to tell him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo what does she think? Did she want you to do the film, or is she a Jane Austen purist, too?\u201d</p><p>Here we go, here we go, here we go. I pick at a fingernail, staring at my hands. \u201cShe died when I was six.\u201d The words spill out quickly, but softly, and I want to tell him everything, all of it, though I can\u2019t say any more because I can\u2019t quite face the bits and pieces I always fold away and shove under the surface. My father and the way we haven\u2019t connected since we lost her. My inability to have a normal childhood because I\u2019ve been in front of a camera, pretending to be someone else, since before she was gone. Chloe and the way she always expects to be the center of every universe near her. And I\u2019m okay, I really am, most of the time. But sometimes, I\u2019m just not.</p><p>Graham doesn\u2019t speak until I look at him. His eyes hold mine, and they don\u2019t slide away, uncomfortable with the fact that mine are brimming with tears. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Emma,\u201d he says.</p><p>I nod, take a breath, and pull a napkin from under the nearly-empty plate, pressing it under my eyes. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>We sit outside for a while longer, eventually talking about other work we\u2019ve done. I tell him about the Nazi director of the grape juice commercial, and he tells me about the attractive forty-something star of an art house film he did a few years ago who showed up at his trailer door wearing a robe and nothing else.</p><p>\u201cDo I want to know how you found out about the \u2018nothing else\u2019?\u201d</p><p>He grimaces. \u201cThe exact way you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEww... so did you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no. I told her I had to get up early, and she said, \u2018you don\u2019t have to be scared, Graham,\u2019 and I just blustered through it, of course, something like, \u2018oh, no it\u2019s not that, I\u2019m just really tired.\u2019 And then I didn\u2019t answer my door after that. She got the idea eventually.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cI may still need therapy over that night.\u201d</p><p>We end up sitting on my bed, six or so inches of space between us, watching a movie on pay-per-view. I fall asleep about halfway through it. When I wake up just after 4 a.m., he\u2019s gone. The chairs are back inside, the balcony door closed and locked. The comforter is folded over me like a cocoon, and there\u2019s a note on the nightstand.</p><p>Thanks for helping with the mountain of cake.</p><p>I\u2019ll be downstairs at 6 if you want to run.</p><p>Graham</p> <p>I set the alarm on my phone for 5:40.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>REID</p><p>I should be asleep until noon. Instead, I\u2019m wide awake and staring at the ceiling by nine a.m., deciding how pissed I should be.</p><p>Between the late dinner and the martini bar last night, we drove past Brooke, Meredith, MiShaun and Jenna going into a club. Tadd pointed them out. \u201cThere go the girls\u2014small world, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see Emma,\u201d I commented.</p><p>Quinton yawned, glancing back at them through the rear window. \u201cYeah, I talked to Meredith earlier, on the way to the elevator. She said Emma was wavering over whether to go or not tonight. Apparently she had a monster hangover this morning.\u201d</p><p>Meaning Graham and Emma both ditched.</p> <p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d I swore.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Quinton asked as Tadd grinned at me and shook his head. He\u2019s always been a big fan of any girl who gets under my skin.</p><p>We were three-for-three last night, soothing the annoyance somewhat\u2014at least until this morning. There was a bachelorette party at the bar\u2014nine girls and three guys, and all of them looked hot. Quinton was ready to lead the offensive, but Tadd cautioned that when encountering a group like that, you have to watch out for the Cheerleader Effect: the inexplicable consequence of a few extreme hotties in a group bringing less attractive friends up to par. Possible hazardous situation. As a man of action, Quinton was skeptical.</p><p>Tadd glanced at the group surreptitiously. \u201cOkay, look. At first glance, all three of those guys are candidates. But in reality, only one of them is one-nighter material.\u201d</p><p>Quinton and I checked them out. \u201cI don\u2019t see it,\u201d Quinton said.</p><p>\u201cEasy\u2014it\u2019s the blond guy,\u201d I said.</p><p>Tadd sighed. \u201cReid, you obviously have a blonde predilection\u2014\u201d</p><p>My palms turned up, shoulders shrugging. \u201cBlondes are my gold standard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get distracted by hair color.\u201d He shook his head, hair falling perfectly around his face, and leaned closer. \u201cDudes. It\u2019s obviously the Hispanic guy. Look again.\u201d</p><p>Quinton stared, frowning. \u201cI still don\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><p>Tadd rolled his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s because you are disproportionately straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me! Unless disproportionately means all\u2014then guilty as charged. And BTW, Reid, dibs on the sister who looks like Halle Berry\u2019s reincarnation.\u201d</p><p>Tadd pursed his lips. \u201cDude, Halle Berry isn\u2019t dead, thus she can\u2019t be reincarnated.\u201d</p><p>Quinton emptied his drink and got to his feet. \u201cWhatever, man, I\u2019m going in.\u201d</p><p>Tadd and I each grabbed an arm and sat him back down. \u201cHold up, noob,\u201d Tadd said. \u201cLet\u2019s get Halle and Mr. Tall Dark and Gay to bring their most attractive girlfriend and trot over here.\u201d</p><p>Quinton sat, still unconvinced. \u201cWe can do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch and learn.\u201d Tadd turned to me. \u201cReid, you\u2019ve just said something incredibly amusing.\u201d And then he laughed his patented Tadd-Wyler-Sexy-Laugh while I smiled and chuckled along.</p><p>A dozen pairs of eyes shifted to us. Tadd made eye contact with his target while Quinton\u2014who\u2019s a remarkably fast learner\u2014did the same with his. I appeared oblivious, staring into my martini, pulling the olive from the tiny plastic sword with my teeth. Tadd broke eye contact, only to glance back a few seconds later. Quinton smirked, straightening and stretching his arms behind his neck in a blatant display of biceps. And then we sat back and waited for recognition to flicker.</p><p>A few hours, several dirty martinis and two cigars later, Bob was escorting the bride-to-be from my hotel room to a waiting Town Car. Personal policy\u2014I don\u2019t wake up with them still in my bed. And don\u2019t worry\u2014there was no way she was going to pull off wearing white, long before I came along.</p><p>Emma</p><p>My father and Chloe have landed\u2014she texted me to gripe about some lady in a wheelchair at the front of the plane who was \u201cholding everyone up.\u201d They have to collect Chloe\u2019s bags after deplaning (she can\u2019t travel without at least two colossal suitcases and several smaller ones), so I have about an hour before they arrive, which I spend wishing we were filming today, chewing on a hangnail, checking my clothes, changing my clothes, and straightening my hotel room in a state of total anxiety.</p><p>She texts me again from the shuttle, annoyed that there wasn\u2019t a limo to pick them up. They booked a room in the same hotel, and she wants me to come down to the lobby to meet them when they arrive. When I exit the elevator, I catch her irate voice at the front desk one second too late to scramble back in. She\u2019s pissed that their room isn\u2019t on the same floor as the cast and crew. The producers left strict instructions for hotel management with a list of approved guests for rooms on our floor. There are no exceptions, for privacy and security reasons. Unfortunately, \u201cno exceptions\u201d isn\u2019t something Chloe accepts.</p><p>I do the only thing that makes sense in that moment. I make a beeline across the marble elevator bank and hide behind a column.</p><p>\u201cBut our minor daughter is on the fourth floor!\u201d Her voice pitches higher, and I picture every head in the room swiveling towards her, just as she likes it. The concierge begins to speak in soothing tones, assuring her that there\u2019s a lovely room reserved for them one floor down from me. He adds that he\u2019ll be sending up a complimentary bottle of champagne shortly, in hopes of making their stay more enjoyable.</p><p>As I scoot around the pillar to avoid being spotted, Chloe harrumphs her halfhearted consent and they board the elevator with their overloaded luggage cart. The doors close and the dial shows their assent to the third floor, and I\u2019m stuck inadvertently eavesdropping on the concierge chastising the desk clerk.</p><p>\u201cIn the future, simply say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, ma\u2019am, that floor is fully occupied.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I inch around the column. The desk clerk is young, dark-haired and slendar, with classically pretty features. Chloe would hate her on sight. Red-faced, she stares at the marble countertop.</p><p>\u201cRelatives of celebrities can be unreasonable, and if the relative becomes offended, we risk losing the celebrity\u2019s patronage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d the clerk mumbles. Thanks to Chloe\u2019s furor, the \u201ccelebrity\u201d being discussed is me. Awesome.</p><p>\u201cUm, Emma?\u201d</p><p>I jump, caught skulking between the column and a massive potted plant. \u201cMiShaun,\u201d I gasp. \u201cGod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are we hiding from?\u201d She peers around the immediate area.</p><p>\u201cMy stepmother. She and my father just got here, they haven\u2019t even seen me yet, and she\u2019s already bitched out the desk clerk and the concierge. They\u2019ll be here all week. They\u2019re going to be interacting with everyone.\u201d I close my eyes. \u201cOh. My. God.\u201d</p><p>MiShaun takes my arm and leads me to the elevator. \u201cEmma, let me share a liberating truth concerning our relationships with our parents, especially as we become adults.\u201d She pushes the fourth floor button and the doors shut us in. \u201cThe people who know and love us will not hold our parents, or their crazy-ass behavior, against us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about everyone else, all the people who don\u2019t know and love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew everyone else.\u201d</p><p>Chloe and my father have been invited to dinner by Adam Richter. This event would be doomed enough in itself, but a few of the cast members are going as well. I\u2019m considering excuses (sore throat, seizure, untimely death?) when the concierge calls to say the taxi is here; an impending sense of disaster follows me down to their room. Chloe answers the door wearing a black dress and black patent stilettos; the dress is shorter and tighter than ideal, but for my stepmother, it\u2019s practically demure. Just as I release the pent-up breath I\u2019ve been holding since I got off of the elevator, her eyes sweep over me. \u201cEmma, when are you going to start wearing adult clothing? Stylish jewelry might be an improvement, too.\u201d</p><p>My outfit: aqua tank and gauzy skirt with a fluid watercolor pattern in various shades of aqua. I\u2019m wearing small silver hoops in my ears and my mother\u2019s ring on my right hand\u2014a single princess-cut diamond, channel set into a solid platinum band.</p><p>Chloe sighs, refreshing her dark lipstick in the mirror. \u201cAnd another thing.\u201d She blots her lips with a tissue. \u201cSome makeup wouldn\u2019t hurt, either.\u201d</p><p>My father exits the bathroom, knotting a tie. \u201cI think I look beautiful just as I am,\u201d he says, hugging one arm around my shoulders, oblivious to her attack on me, as usual.</p><p>\u201cOh, Connor.\u201d She pushes him playfully in the chest.</p><p>Screw everyone else, screw everyone else, screw everyone else. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 17</p><p>REID</p><p>I arrive at the restaurant with Richter and one of the production assistants. \u201cReservation for Richter, party of eight,\u201d she tells the ma\u00eetre d, whose eyes widen when he sees me. Waiters scramble to get our table ready as Graham and Brooke come in, followed by Emma and her parents. Her mom is hot.</p><p>At a circular table, Emma takes the seat between her dad and Laura, the PA, and I sit next to Brooke. Graham is on her other side, of course, and she leans pointedly away from me and towards him.</p> <p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Chloe, Emma\u2019s stepmother.\u201d She drops into the seat next to me.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m Reid, her costar. Nice to meet you.\u201d I extend a hand and she giggles. I shake her dad\u2019s hand as well, smile at Emma.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d the PA says. \u201cReady for tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, all set.\u201d Her smile is nervous, and I wonder why until half an hour later when Chloe is on her third glass of wine, talking to me. My mother would say Chloe is not familiar with using her inside voice. Or any discretion whatsoever.</p><p>She rests her chin in her hand, elbow propped on the table, and leans close. \u201cSo what\u2019s the wildest thing a woman has ever asked you to autograph?\u201d With her free hand, she\u2019s playing with her distractively flashy earring, after which she rests her hand on my forearm a beat or so too long\u2014classic flirt mode. She couldn\u2019t be more Emma-opposite.</p> <p>I lean closer. \u201cWell, I once had a beautiful woman ask me to sign her panties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me!\u201d Chloe\u2019s laugh is loud and a little high-pitched, and when I glance at Emma, she looks ready to bolt. Her pulse quickens at her throat and her wide eyes flick to Richter, Laura, Brooke.</p><p>And then Graham. I register the fact of eye contact between them, though I can\u2019t see his face from this angle. She inhales slowly. Her expression becomes more composed.</p><p>Hmm.</p><p>Richter asks her a question about her last movie, some holiday made-for-television crap about a deaf woman whose hearing daughter teaches her to play the violin. Chloe\u2019s conversation with me, meanwhile, gets raunchier by the minute (\u201cWas she wearing them at the time?\u201d), and Emma\u2019s doing everything she can to ignore it. If it was anyone else, I\u2019d be amused at the way she\u2019s letting this get to her. As it is, I find myself wanting to shield her, but I have no idea what to do. The concept of using a personal filter in public escapes this woman.</p><p>Brooke eyes Chloe briefly, then leans to Graham and whispers something. Straightening, she laughs. \u201cDon\u2019t you think so?\u201d</p> <p>Without replying, Graham refills her wine glass and then Emma\u2019s, whose hand is clenching a fork as though she\u2019s considering its effectiveness as a weapon. Or a suicidal device. Her eyes connect with Graham\u2019s for a split second and she calms visibly, again.</p><p>I don\u2019t like this at all.</p><p>Emma</p><p>This evening is a nightmare. When I look at my father, he seems tolerant of his wife\u2019s behavior rather than mortified. I\u2019ve never understood their relationship, and I guess I never will. Towards the end of the meal, Chloe bats her lashes at Reid, loud and effusive over something he\u2019s just said. His expression is veiled, but not enough for me to miss the fact that he\u2019s regarding Chloe the way a scientist would examine a strange new species. Oh God.</p><p>What does a panic attack feel like? I can\u2019t breathe, and my heart rate is erratic, it\u2019s all over the place, I wish I was dead. My director is sitting here, and my costars. Everyone is staring at her, staring at me. I look at Graham, and he\u2019s watching me, again, his eyes sympathetic and calming. I take a deep breath. Tell myself that this night has to end eventually.</p><p>Then Reid announces that he\u2019s meeting Quinton and the others for a night of club hopping along 6th Street. \u201cEmma, you\u2019re coming, right?\u201d</p><p>Before I can reply, Chloe says, \u201cOf course she\u2019s going! Oh, Connor, can we go, too?\u201d She does her wind-up monkey clap as my father shrugs and agrees. I want to strangle him.</p><p>I pull my phone out in the taxi while Chloe blathers to my father about how cute and sweet Reid is.</p> <p>Me: FML. Chloe is coming clubbing with us. Where is my invisibility cloak?!?</p><p>Em: OMG. When do they come home?</p><p>Me: Thursday. The buildings here are not tall enough to leap from!</p><p>Em: DO NOT SAY THAT. I\u2019ll cross my fingers that she breaks an ankle. Or her pelvis.</p><p>Emily\u2019s text gives me an idea, and I when we arrive, I manage to convince everyone that I sprained my ankle running this morning and can\u2019t dance. Biding my time, I perch on a barstool and tip the bartender ten bucks to give me water refills. The first chance I get, I am so gone. My chance comes when Chloe and Reid move to the dance floor, right after my father slips away without me\u2014one more strike against him, as far as I\u2019m concerned.</p><p>The hotel is only two or three well-lit blocks away. Despite the semi-buzzed crowd and a few typical hey-baby comments, I feel fairly safe. But when a hand grips my upper arm lightly from behind, I spin around, ready to shove the heel of my palm into some guy\u2019s nose.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, hold up.\u201d Graham releases my arm, hands up in surrender.</p><p>\u201cOhmigod, Graham.\u201d I wait for my heart to slow as the crowd parts around us.</p><p>\u201cI thought your ankle was critically injured.\u201d He smiles down at me as we begin walking towards the hotel, side by side. I didn\u2019t see him at the club, though I spotted Brooke and Quinton dancing.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, creative subterfuge,\u201d he says, removing a cigarette and lighter from his pocket.</p><p>\u201cDid you leave just to get a smoke?\u201d</p><p>He cups his hand over the cigarette and flicks the lighter. \u201cI probably left for the same reason you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seriously doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>Please, do not make me say it. I look at Graham, willing these words into his brain. He nods, holding the cigarette to the tiny flame and taking a drag, turning towards the street to exhale. The smoke trails behind him.</p><p>\u201cGraham... I assume you wouldn\u2019t like to be thought of as hypocritical?\u201d</p><p>He gives me a puzzled look. \u201cCorrect...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if you\u2019re going to call me on my compulsion of constantly saying \u2018huh,\u2019 then I think it\u2019s only fair that I call you on a little addiction called nicotine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh.\u201d He takes another drag, stubbing it out before we enter the hotel. \u201cYeah, I know you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Wow. That was easy. \u201cSo what are you going to do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve tried quitting a couple of times. Didn\u2019t go so well.\u201d He runs a hand through his hair as we wait for the elevator. \u201cA miserable failure, in fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re helping me quit saying \u2018huh\u2019 every five seconds, so maybe I can help you. How did you try to quit before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCold turkey.\u201d The elevator opens, and we get on. He jabs the 4 button.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard cold turkey doesn\u2019t work so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I, um, Googled quitting smoking.\u201d We walk down the hallway, reaching his room first.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cSo, what does work? According to your research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the patches and gum increase your chances of success, also quitting with someone, or having a support group. And anti-depressants help; but you\u2019d need a prescription for those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looked this stuff up for me? To help me quit?\u201d There\u2019s a small crease between his brows, and I wonder if this is over-the-top interference.</p><p>\u201cYeah...\u201d</p><p>He peers at me, his mouth pulling up on one side. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>He pulls out his wallet, removes his key card. \u201cDo you want to come in, watch a movie or... induce another cake coma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no, I couldn\u2019t eat anything more today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay, well, I\u2019ll see you in the morning, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d I realize then that I\u2019d only meant to turn down more food, not his company. I turn to walk to my room, opening my door when he says, \u201cEmma?\u201d His gaze wanders over me. \u201cI like your outfit. Kinda gypsy. Suits you.\u201d</p><p>Maybe this night wasn\u2019t a total waste.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>REID</p><p>Emma disappeared last night. Again. I half expected to find a glass slipper this time on the way out. Not that I don\u2019t get Emma\u2019s reaction where her stepmother is concerned. When she vanished, I was sympathetic.</p><p>Then at some point, I noticed that Graham was gone too. What the hell? My brain tells me to just back off, there are millions of chicks to be had. I could walk outside and come back in with several right now. And most of them would be ecstatic to do whatever I want, however I want it. So why am I responding like this to Emma? The challenge? That\u2019s how I felt about Brooke, once upon a time\u2014and look where that got me.</p><p>Today, we\u2019re filming one of the earliest scenes: a party at the home of Charlotte Lucas, best friend of Lizbeth. When I arrive on location, I feel like I\u2019ve been trapped in a Pottery Barn catalog. I watch MiShaun and Emma do their opening scene, and I don\u2019t care if it makes sense. I want her. No marginal, semi-talented, indie-film asswipe like Graham is going to keep her from me. Besides, what the hell is he doing with Brooke?</p><p>Laura tells me Tadd and I are up next, so I turn away and do my breathing exercises. Time enough to think about this shit later.</p><p>INT. LUCAS HOUSE \u2013 NIGHT</p><p>WILL and CHARLIE look over fellow partygoers as LIZBETH hides just around the corner and listens to their conversation:</p><p>CHARLIE</p><p>(speaking over music)</p><p>Isn\u2019t this awesome? The girls here are gorgeous.</p><p>WILL</p><p>(condescendingly)</p><p>Charlie, there aren\u2019t any hot girls at this party, except the one you\u2019ve been chatting up. I\u2019ll give you that one, but that\u2019s it.</p><p>CHARLIE</p><p>Jane Bennet is the hottest girl here. But her sister Lizbeth is cute - I talked to her for a few minutes. She seems nice, and intelligent. Just your type. You should talk to her.</p><p>WILL</p><p>She was okay, I guess, but not worth the effort.</p><p>CHARLIE</p><p>God, Will, you\u2019re freaking impossible. Does anyone ever measure up enough for you?</p><p>WILL</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath here.</p><p>LIZBETH, indignant, straightens away from her hiding place and marches past them, crossing the room to Charlotte, who\u2019s picking up discarded soda cans and napkins.</p><p>\u201cCut!\u201d Richter says.</p><p>Emma</p><p>\u201cEmma, good scene.\u201d Reid holds a venti doubleshot caramel macchiato, his caffeinated beverage of choice. He drinks at least one a day, sometimes two or three, at which point Richter forbids him more caffeine, because he starts talking so fast he runs words together\u2014like a younger, better-looking version of my agent, Dan. Scary. \u201cWhen you stormed past me and Tadd, it was like a tornado moved past. I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to get you mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, they call it \u2018acting\u2019 for a reason,\u201d I retort, trying not to smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very convincing as a woman scorned, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201d He attempts to look stern, his eyes teasing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you suggesting that I have experience in being scorned?\u201d I\u2019m aiming for playfully sarcastic, hoping it\u2019s not resembling resentfully bitchy.</p><p>He looks down at me, eyebrows raised. \u201cI\u2019m suggesting no such thing. I just can\u2019t see any guy being as stupid as Will, if Lizbeth was as hot as you.\u201d I can\u2019t stop the blush that creeps across my face. \u201cWhat happened to you last night?\u201d He\u2019s so good-looking up close that it takes my breath away. I feel like I\u2019m standing next to a work of art. \u201cI looked up and you were gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been craving more sleep lately.\u201d I turn to grab a bottle of water from the cooler, breaking the mesmeric connection.</p><p>I almost tell him I\u2019ve been getting up early and running every morning, but I don\u2019t. Graham and I are the only ones from our cast up and on the street that early, though we\u2019ve crossed tracks with a couple of the production people. Not that Reid would bother getting up early to run with me. I tell myself I don\u2019t want the complication.</p> <p>The assistant director calls for attention. \u201cOkay folks, let\u2019s get some general party shots, dancing, some semi-inappropriate touching, etcetera, and we\u2019ll be finished for the day.\u201d This announcement earns an exhausted cheer from everyone. \u201cPlaces!\u201d</p><p>This morning, Graham was waiting in the lobby when I got downstairs. As we headed for the trail, deciding to reverse our usual direction to mix it up, he examined the sky. \u201cIt\u2019s overcast this morning.\u201d The clouds were dark and heavy, the air laden with a metallic pre-storm smell. \u201cWe may get rained on.\u201d</p><p>The sky remained merely ominous until we were at our halfway point, when it opened up a couple of seconds after a single deafening crack of thunder shook the ground and forced an embarrassing yelp from me. As it started pouring, we looked at each other and burst out laughing. We were drenched in five minutes. When a covered picnic area appeared just off the path, he sprinted towards it, and I followed. We sat on the table with our feet on the bench, staring out at the wet landscape.</p><p>I combed my fingers through my hair, squeezing the water out of it. \u201cSo what did you decide about the smoking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to do it. Quit, I mean.\u201d He ran both hands through his dripping hair, pushing it back and off of his face. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy, though.\u201d He bumped my knee with his. \u201cSo, are you prepared to be my support group?\u201d</p> <p>I smiled. \u201cI guess I sorta have to, since I\u2019m the one who goaded you into doing it.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me like he was trying to read my thoughts, and I was abruptly conscious of his proximity, his dark eyes examining my face. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t deserve your help after teasing you so mercilessly about your cute little \u2018huh\u2019 habit.\u201d</p><p>Raising a hand to my face, he gently swept a strand of wet hair off of my forehead, tucking it behind my ear. (Cute. Little. Huh. Habit?) I swallowed, my pulse thrumming so loudly in my ears that it drowned out the deluge pounding all around us. Our eyes held as his hand lowered, grazing past my ear, my shoulder, and down my arm, raising a wake of goosebumps in a trail behind his fingertips to my hand where it rested on my thigh.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, he hopped down from the table, tugging at my hand, staring out at the rain. My hand was still loosely caught in his. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to let up soon enough. We\u2019re going to have to brave it. Just think coffee.\u201d He looked back at me and smiled. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll try not to think cigarette. Though no promises until I get those damned patches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d My voice was weightless, too insubstantial to be heard.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded. He squeezed my hand once, and then let go and jogged out into the rain. I followed him, a million more questions in my head than were there ten minutes before.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>REID</p><p>Walt Riggs, an LA friend and front man of a band, is in Austin for a gig tomorrow night. I\u2019m exhausted as hell after filming a twelve-hour day, but I don\u2019t have any scenes tomorrow, so I told Walt we could hang out tonight. I pick him up from the airport in the limo, and Bob insists on going along. The man takes his bodyguarding duties seriously.</p><p>While we\u2019re waiting outside the arrival gate, Bob and I are playing Call of Duty. I\u2019ve gotten used to playing Tadd and Quinton, so I think nothing of shooting Bob\u2019s guy in the head after a campaign. We do it all the time. Bob, however, is unfamiliar. His mouth drops open and he just looks at me. \u201cWhat the hell, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr, sorry, Bob. Didn\u2019t know you\u2019d have an issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re partners. We just kicked ass together, Semper Fi and shit, and you shot me. That\u2019s just wrong, man. That\u2019s just so wrong.\u201d He shakes his head, crestfallen. Jesus. Note to self: don\u2019t play Call of Duty with Bob.</p><p>Walt comes out then, his jagged punk emo hair hanging in his eyes, leather bands wrapping both wrists, fitted t-shirt, jeans tight to his ankles. He\u2019s always dressed like this, caught constant crap about it from his jock older brothers and dad until recently, when all of a sudden he\u2019s a rock star. His bag is slung over one shoulder, along with his guitar case. I hit the button to lower the opaque window, calling his name as he\u2019s glancing around. He sees me and smiles, sauntering over as the driver exits to take his stuff. People crane their necks to look at him as he hands it over.</p> <p>He\u2019s unlikely to be recognized by many people at this stage, but he will be, and soon. Rolling Stone sent someone to do an interview and photo spread with his band a week or so ago. In addition to his half Irish, half Korean looks\u2014pale skin, coal black hair and piercing green eyes\u2014the boy has serious vocal talent.</p><p>\u201cHey, man. Nice.\u201d He appraises the limo as I push the door open and he gets in, shoving the hair out of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cBetter get used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019ll see.\u201d He glances at Bob, immediately thrusting a hand out. \u201cHey, I\u2019m Walt.\u201d</p><p>Bob gives him the bone-crushing shake I know from experience and barks, \u201cBob.\u201d Walt doesn\u2019t even flinch.</p><p>\u201cGroovy.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cSo what are we doing, man? I\u2019m totally wired, but I need a shower. That flight was a bitch\u2014the air wasn\u2019t working right or something. It was like hell in the sky.\u201d He stops, pulls out his boarding pass and scribbles something on the back of it\u2014my best guess is lyrics.</p><p>I check the time on my phone. It\u2019s a little after eight. \u201cWe can drop you at your hotel, come back at like ten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliant.\u201d</p><p>When Bob and I get back to my hotel, Bob says the car will be ready at 9:40. He lumbers off the elevator, less effusive than usual, and turns left towards his room. I probably should\u2019ve apologized again for killing his Call of Duty guy. I shake my head, turning right to go down the hall to my room, and look up just in time to see Graham going into Brooke\u2019s room. They are so hooking up.</p><p>Emma\u2019s room is a few down from Brooke\u2019s, and since I know where Graham is\u2014and therefore where he isn\u2019t\u2014I think about inviting her to go out with Walt and me. But she had a more demanding day than I did\u2014more scenes, which equaled more retakes due to flukes like the A/C not keeping up with the temperature in that house and everyone looking shiny. Plus she has to film tomorrow and would need to be back in early.</p><p>I\u2019m a patient guy. Okay, that\u2019s bullshit... but I can be patient with good reason. The concert tomorrow night will be perfect for testing Emma\u2019s and my off-screen chemistry. I\u2019d already planned to invite the whole group. Brooke is a total music beast, especially little-known but growing hotter breakout bands like Walt\u2019s. She\u2019ll definitely be there, and will no doubt keep Graham\u2019s attention, leaving Emma to me. I pass Emma\u2019s room, having a couple of vodka shots in my room to loosen up instead.</p><p>Emma</p><p>After the day\u2019s filming, I was too tired to think clearly, let alone do any more than change into boxers and a t-shirt, order a bowl of fruit from room service, take a few bites, and collapse. Thank God my parents decided to entertain themselves tonight.</p><p>I could have sworn Graham was going to kiss me this morning, and I wanted him to, but instead, he turned away. Or ran away, more like. Because of Brooke? And then I went on set and Reid was attentive and flirting with me all day, but I\u2019m not sure he wants more than a fling. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what I want.</p><p>I fell asleep way too early, thoughts of Reid and Graham swirling through my head, and wake at 10 p.m. to the thrashing images of a Nirvana video on the TV\u2014Come as You are. I\u2019ve been sleeping for two hours, and I can tell I\u2019m not going to be able to get back to sleep for another couple of hours, at least. I putter around the room, restless, eat some peanuts from the mini-bar, brush my teeth, watch a few videos, do some sit-ups.</p><p>Finally I grab my room key, open my door and peek into the hallway. No one\u2019s out. I pad down to Graham\u2019s door and knock softly, wait twenty or thirty seconds and knock again, a little harder. Nothing. As I turn to go back to my room, I hear a door open farther down the hall. I glance back and see Graham, leaving Brooke\u2019s room. Craaaap. Practically running to my room, I jam the card into the lock and for once it immediately blinks green and I\u2019m in, shutting the door behind me. Dammit. Dammit. Dammit.</p><p>A minute later Graham knocks at my door; I know it\u2019s him without looking. I chew my thumbnail, deliberating. He maybe almost kissed me this morning, and he just came out of Brooke\u2019s room. But we\u2019re friends, and nothing actually happened this morning, and it\u2019s silly to refuse to talk to him because he was in her room.</p><p>I take a deep breath and open the door, employing every acting skill I possess to fix a pleasant expression on my face. His arms are propped on either side of the doorframe, his lanky, muscular body filling up the space. I\u2019m aware of nothing but how casually sexy he is: barefoot, in jeans and a white t-shirt.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d His dark eyes search my face. \u201cDid you need something? I just... thought maybe you were knocking on my door just now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. I mean, no, I don\u2019t really need anything, and yeah, I knocked on your door, but it\u2019s cool. I\u2019m just bored. I fell asleep for a while, and now I\u2019m awake and kinda wired...\u201d Shut up, Emma. \u201cand... uh... that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBored, huh? What did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>I try to push away the answers that crowd in, most notably come in and finish what you started this morning.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I was just thinking maybe you were still up, or something...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you were right.\u201d He smiles, stretching against the door frame, hands gripping the top, his shirt teasing up and displaying a sliver of skin. \u201cSo. Can I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I back into the room, \u201cSure. I\u2019m sorry. Jeez. I guess I\u2019m still a little fuzzy from the late nap.\u201d</p><p>He walks past me and drops into one of the chairs and I sit on the bed, folding my legs under me. \u201cDo you wanna watch something?\u201d he asks, tilting his head towards the television. \u201cOr... I could interrogate you, find out all your secrets.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My bed is unmade, covers and pillows askew, the only light in the room coming from one small lamp and flashing MTV images. From a lifetime of reading scene settings, I know this setting is the definition of intimate. \u201cYou already know more than a lot of people know about me,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m relatively boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. And I don\u2019t even know the basic stuff. Like, how old are you?\u201d He leans forward in the chair, elbows on knees.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s certainly a stimulating topic. I\u2019m seventeen, for another two months and...\u201d I count in my head \u201c...three weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, eighteen in less than three months.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah... is that surprising?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you look as though you could be younger than that, but you seem older, more mature. It isn\u2019t surprising; I just wasn\u2019t sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how old are you? Twenty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, since June. How\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>I am not telling him that I Internet stalked him. \u201cWell, you seem younger than that, very immature, in fact, but you look older...\u201d I laugh at the shocked look on his face, and then he growls and starts out of the chair. Backing farther onto the bed, I shake my head, still laughing. \u201cNoooo...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I look like an immature old guy, is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d One corner of his mouth turns up as he puts a knee on the bed, following me.</p><p>\u201cPositively decrepit.\u201d I hold my hands out in what\u2019s clearly simulated protection as he advances. I\u2019m almost to the other side of the bed when he grabs both of my hands in one of his, sweeping his opposite arm around my waist and pulling me towards him. In two seconds, I\u2019m flat on my back and he\u2019s on his knees next to me.</p><p>He releases one wrist long enough to catch it with his other hand, and he flattens my hands to the bed on either side of my head. His eyes are black in the low light of the room. \u201cDo you surrender?\u201d</p><p>My heart is pounding, and I\u2019m tingling from head to toe. \u201cSurrender to what?\u201d I whisper, my chest rising and falling, my eyes locked on his.</p><p>His gaze doesn\u2019t waver. \u201cA kiss.\u201d</p><p>Images flash through my mind: the sincerity of his concern when I told him about losing my mother. The feel of him sitting next to me this morning, soaked through and touching my face. The jolt of seeing him exiting Brooke\u2019s room a few minutes ago. None of this adds up, or makes sense, and I want to care about that, but I can\u2019t find the will to resist\u2014not just him, but my own desire, or curiosity, or something. I don\u2019t care what. I want that kiss.</p> <p>He loosens his hold, starts to draw back because I haven\u2019t answered.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I breathe, and he freezes.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He trails his fingers over the side of my face, temple to neck, tracing a path, neck to waist. His right hand moves palm to palm with my left, intertwines our fingers as he lowers his head, and then his mouth is moving over mine, softly, carefully. I squeeze the hand holding mine and shift closer to him, clutching his shirt in my free hand, and he deepens the kiss, stretching out next to me, one knee hooked over my thigh. The hand at my waist progresses down over my hip, moving over my bare leg to the sensitive spot behind my knee. His hand is warm on my skin, drawing my leg over his until we\u2019re tangled together in the middle of the bed, his opposite shoulder under my head, his arm encircling me. His tongue traces my lips softly, parting them, thrusting inside. I moan, opening my mouth and pressing as close to him as I can get.</p><p>Too soon, he pulls away, both of us panting, sucking air as though we\u2019ve been underwater. Teasing his fingers through my hair, he pushes a strand behind my ear, and I close my eyes as he cradles my head in his hand, the pad of his thumb stroking my cheek and jaw. Our heartbeats slow as we lie there, hardly moving, for several minutes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better go.\u201d His voice is low and rough, full of what he doesn\u2019t say.</p><p>I open my eyes to stare into his, wanting to protest, but no coherent words come. His eyes are so dark there is no color to them at all, just guarded depths, full of thoughts and motivations I can\u2019t decipher.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d he says, extracting himself slowly from my legs and hands. He leans over me, kissing my forehead, turning and padding from the room without a backward glance. I lie motionless except for the in and out of my breath, the beat of my heart, the pulse through my veins. Almost convinced I\u2019ve dreamed the entire interlude, I fall asleep, and do dream it. Over and over.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>REID</p><p>Walt is into a my-body\u2019s-a-temple phase. I don\u2019t judge\u2014I mean maybe he hit a wall. He was going pretty hardcore for a while, getting into shit I won\u2019t even touch. And I\u2019ve touched a lot. We\u2019re at the bar they\u2019ll be playing tomorrow, and while I\u2019m on my second beer, Walt has charmed the chick bartender into heating water for a cup of tea (he brought his own Tazo).</p><p>Yeah, the half-Asian guy is having tea in the bar. And I\u2019ll be goddamned if it couldn\u2019t get him play from some of the girls nearby.</p><p>Bob, obviously still offended that I shot his avatar, sent Jeff with us tonight. Jeff is plenty imposing. He\u2019s as much of a land mass as Bob, covered in tattoos, and has a single, thin scar running through one eyebrow, touching the cheek below and continuing off the jaw. At some point I\u2019m going to be drunk enough to ask him how he got it. I just hope I remember his answer, if he gives it. Must be some story.</p><p>The band is good. Not as good as Walt\u2019s, but decent. The floor space below the little rise on which the band performs is full of people dancing\u2014mostly girls. As the evening wears on, they begin to notice Walt and me... and Jeff. That\u2019s the thing about bodyguards. The main purpose of them is intimidation, with protection a close second. Enough intimidation and the protection element is never called into play. This is all great when there\u2019s a threat, which is not the case at the moment. I\u2019m about to tell Jeff to get invisible when a couple of girls break off from the herd and come over. Jesus, finally.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d one says. \u201cWe were thinkin\u2019 you guys look lonely.\u201d None too original. But they\u2019re both drop-dead hot, so who cares.</p><p>Apparently, Walt cares. \u201cNah. I\u2019m enjoying the music and just watching you girls dance. Reid?\u201d</p><p>The girl\u2019s face goes through the emotions of having been rejected and complimented, and then her eyes widen and she looks at me, blinking. \u201cAre you for real Reid Alexander? I mean we thought you looked like him but you\u2019re really him? You\u2019re not shittin\u2019 me?\u201d</p><p>Jeff sits up straighter, crosses his arms over his chest. The posture doesn\u2019t go unnoticed, but it doesn\u2019t dissuade them, either. \u201cSeriously?\u201d the second girl says. \u201cOhmigod.\u201d She looks back at Walt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nobody,\u201d he says, and sips his tea, observing her through a black fringe of bangs.</p><p>She looks as though she doesn\u2019t believe him. \u201cThen it\u2019ll be okay with him\u2014\u201d she gestures to Jeff \u201c\u2014if I take you with me?\u201d</p><p>Walt laughs. \u201cI suppose so, in theory. But I\u2019m not interested in going anywhere. You\u2019re welcome to have a seat, though?\u201d</p><p>She looks at his lap as he hooks an empty chair at a nearby table with his foot and pulls it over. As she\u2019s considering, some recorded pop song comes on because the band is taking a break. The girls both squeal and ask us to dance. Something about Walt\u2019s expression says holy mother of God, no, but he sort of smiles. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Right then the guitarist for the band, a curvy chick with purple hair, multiple piercings and huge blue eyes, glides between the two girls and sits in the chair, ignoring the girls and me completely and leaning towards Walt. His foot is still hooked around the leg of the chair. \u201cYou\u2019re Walt Riggs.\u201d She sticks her hand out. \u201cI\u2019m Carrie.\u201d Walt takes it, turns her hand over to read the tattoo on the inside of her wrist, which looks like Latin. \u201cIt basically says \u2018been there, done that,\u2019\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cCool... You sure you\u2019ve been there enough, done that enough, to have it permanently inscribed?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cMaybe not. But I\u2019m getting closer, and I\u2019ve already got the ink saying so when I get there.\u201d</p><p>He gives her a genuine smile, and she laughs, throaty and full. I have to hand it to him, she\u2019s hands down the most intriguing chick in here.</p><p>\u201cBRB,\u201d I say, taking both of the other girls, neither of whom Walt is paying any attention to, onto the dance floor.</p><p>Jeff and I drop him off at his hotel a couple of hours later. I thought he might take Carrie back to his hotel room, because they talked whenever she wasn\u2019t playing, but he said, \u201cNo, man, that\u2019s a professional relationship, you know? Ever heard the rule \u2018don\u2019t shit where you eat\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you just met her tonight, so how professional could that relationship be?\u201d</p><p>He chews the inside of his cheek, thinking. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing. How professional could it ever be, if we just use each other for sex now?\u201d</p><p>Huh. \u201cIf you were playing her, I guess that reasoning makes sense. But if it was mutual?\u201d</p><p>He smiles, shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s never mutual. Somebody always wants more. People\u2019s psyches are complex, man.\u201d</p><p>I consider that for about five seconds. \u201cOkay, so text me tomorrow with what time you want us at the back entrance. There\u2019ll be between five to ten of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Emma</p><p>The last thing I expected, after a kiss like that, was to run the trails alone this morning.</p><p>The lobby was deserted but for the desk clerk and me. Nothing unusual for the early hour, and I\u2019ve beaten Graham downstairs before. Grabbing a section of the newspaper off of a table in the lobby area, I stood while reading it, sure he\u2019d be down any minute. I was nervous, hands cold and stomach shaky, but I was sure that once we started running, once we started talking, those sensations would subside.</p><p>\u201cMs. Pierce?\u201d I turned to find the desk clerk standing four feet away. \u201cI have a message for you.\u201d She passed a folded sheet of paper to me, Emma Pierce scrawled on the outside. I recognized Graham\u2019s handwriting from the note he left on my nightstand a few nights ago.</p><p>Emma \u2013</p><p>Something came up and I had to go home. I\u2019m sorry I won\u2019t be able to make our usual run in the morning. I may be gone a few days. I\u2019m not sure. Just didn\u2019t want you waiting around for me.</p><p>Graham</p><p>For a few minutes, I wondered if there was a hidden message in the last sentence. And then I ran alone, glad for my renewed morning habit, which gave me something nothing else could: the ability to concentrate on little more than putting one foot in front of the other, marking time by counting each stride, until finally I was back in my room, standing under a hot shower.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Emma.\u201d MiShaun breaks through my inattention. While the film crew is working on backdrop shots in the front of the Bennet house, I\u2019ve been sitting at the kitchen table, staring out the back window, reconsidering Graham\u2019s kiss in light of his abrupt absence and possibly cryptic message. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry, MiShaun.\u201d I make no attempt to come up with an excuse, having overplayed the lack-of-caffeine defense, when the actual reason has nothing to do with drinkable stimulants. I can\u2019t get that kiss out of my head. Plus, before we kissed, he\u2019d just come from Brooke\u2019s room. I have no idea what he was doing with her, even if I did shove that thought out of my head before we kissed.</p><p>\u201cI was going to see if you wanted to go over lines, but if you need to zone out, far be it from me to intrude...\u201d She looks curious. I must be more distracted than I thought.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine, just... a lot to think about lately, with my parents still here.\u201d The truth is, I\u2019ve all but forgotten they\u2019re here. \u201cI guess we aren\u2019t doing the mall scenes this week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard they\u2019re holding off until next week to do mall scenes, since Graham\u2019s in them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yeah, Graham...\u201d I say this as though I haven\u2019t been thinking of him all day. My finger traces circles on the table. \u201cWhy did he leave Austin? Did anyone say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard family thing in New York.\u201d</p><p>I feel instantly guilty. \u201cWhat kind of family thing?\u201d</p><p>MiShaun shrugs, shuffling through sides. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get the story when he gets back.\u201d</p><p>I have all the emotional weight of a ping pong ball, flying back and forth between my own feelings for Reid and Graham, nevermind what either of them feels. On the surface, Reid is paying attention to no one but me, while Graham is often occupied with Brooke. Reid is a known player and Graham\u2014who knows what he\u2019s doing? Last night, he went from Brooke\u2019s room straight to mine, and like an idiot I let him kiss me. This should be clear-cut... but the kiss last night felt so right.</p> <p>And then Graham disappeared this morning and everything is more confused than ever.</p><p>\u201cMiShaun? You\u2019re pretty good at giving advice...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need more? Shoot, baby.\u201d</p><p>I swallow. \u201cOkay. So... how do you know whether to follow logic or intuition? I mean, when something looks like one thing, but feels like another\u2014how do you know which is the truth?\u201d</p><p>She puts the pages down and levels a look at me. \u201cIs this about Reid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, just a general question, not relating to anyone in particular.\u201d Just two anyones. I should be crossing my fingers under the table.</p> <p>She presses her lips together, a crease forming on her forehead. Finally, she sighs. \u201cSometimes, you just can\u2019t tell. But I\u2019ll say this, if what looks like the facts of the matter are conflicting with your feelings, then you need more information before deciding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if your feelings seem really sure of themselves?\u201d I ask, knowing the answer.</p><p>\u201cEspecially then.\u201d She narrows her eyes at me, one eyebrow raised. \u201cYou sure this isn\u2019t about Reid? Because this seems like the sort of questions a girl would start asking herself after being kissed senseless by him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t\u2014I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I noticed you being dropped off at the hotel Monday night,\u201d I blurt out. \u201cAnd the driver looked sorta familiar...\u201d Emily calls this redirecting the subject. She\u2019s a big fan of this tactic when losing an argument with her mom. \u201cMiShaun, are you blushing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. My people do not blush.\u201d She puts on her prim and proper face and I smirk at her, because she\u2019s wrong about that. \u201cWell. I\u2019m obviously not as sneaky as I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s he\u2019s like? What does he do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a computer guy. I don\u2019t know the details and I already told him not to bother trying to tell me, because I get disoriented if I have to do any more to my laptop than turn it on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComputer guy, huh?\u201d I wonder vaguely if this \u2018huh\u2019 counts towards Graham\u2019s tally. He isn\u2019t here to rule on it, so I rule no.</p><p>\u201cAmong other things.\u201d A wistful smile crosses her face.</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Emma. You know I don\u2019t kiss and tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say. \u201cBut you can ask me about kissing Reid Alexander.\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, Reid walks around the corner, stops and puts his hands on the back of the chair next to me. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d He smiles, and I know he overheard me.</p><p>\u201cUm, we\u2019re just, uh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing over lines,\u201d MiShaun says, straightening the sheets and placing them between us. \u201cWhat are you doing here, Mr. Alexander? This afternoon is a Lizbeth/Charlotte scene. And as much as the producers would like your pretty face in every shot they can squeeze you into, you are not in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to discuss something with Richter. Also, there\u2019s a concert tonight. It\u2019s an LA band; I know the lead singer. He says we can come in the back way, separate from the crowd, and have our own cordoned-off area so the bodyguards can do their thing. You guys up for it?\u201d</p><p>I nod at MiShaun, and she says, \u201cSure, we\u2019re in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. We\u2019re meeting in the lobby at eight to go get food, and the band goes on around ten.\u201d He drums the top of the chair, blue eyes twinkling. \u201cI\u2019ll let you get back to... whatever you were discussing.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>REID</p><p>\u201cParty of seven for Alexander.\u201d The hostess glances up, her expression morphing into the wide-eyed look I\u2019m used to outside of LA or NYC. You\u2019d think celebrities are imaginary beings, the way people react when they see us in public. Like aliens have landed, or Jesus has risen. My presence alone would have been enough for her, but the addition of whoever else she recognizes in the group renders her incapable of unstuttered speech. Brooke, MiShaun, Quinton, Tadd, Jenna and Emma are along for the ride. Graham, apparently, went home to New York last night, and I\u2019m just so bummed about that. Not.</p><p>I\u2019m careful that there\u2019s no overt touching between Emma and me, just grazes here and there\u2014my hand at the small of her back from the car to the door of the restaurant, and again walking to the table. My arm across the back of her chair. Our shoulders and thighs pressing against each other intermittently while we\u2019re all talking and interacting during dinner. If things go as planned, she won\u2019t have to wait for the movie release to be famous, because everyone wants to know who I\u2019m hooking up with. Paparazzi. Gossip rags and Internet sites. She\u2019s going to have to get used to this\u2014the way that people know who I am, and because of that, they think they know me. Fame is people screaming your name, loving you, hating you, all on a whim.</p><p>When we arrive at the club, we use the band entrance Walt offered, rather than walk through the crowd. The hallways in the back are a cramped, dim maze, and I take Emma\u2019s hand as we\u2019re led through by the manager. We follow him to a restricted area, just off-stage, where we can sit and watch without being recognized or pestered. Bob and Jeff hover nearby.</p><p>I love my fans, but I wish they\u2019d fade off occasionally and let me live my life. I escort Emma to the front spot near the wall. The way the chairs are arranged, there\u2019s no one behind us and no one in front of us of us\u2014it\u2019s private as possible. Quinton is next to me, and Brooke, of course, is as far from me as she can get. My arm is propped across the back of Emma\u2019s chair as the warm-up band winds up their last set.</p><p>The music is deafening, so there\u2019s not a lot of talking. In between sets, Emma asks if I know any of the other band members. \u201cI met the guitarist when I was hanging out with Walt in LA. The other guys, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d she says.</p><p>The music is hella good, and Walt is damned incredible. Girls gathered in front of the stage jostle for position in front of him, but he\u2019s not staying in one place. He plays the whole audience, and everyone\u2019s into it. The floor pulses with bass notes, sending waves of vibration up through my legs. I glance at Emma and she smiles, leans closer and says, \u201cHe\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d My hand moves to her shoulder, kneading the muscles absently. She relaxes under my touch as my fingers slide through her hair at the base of her neck and the moment says now, now, now. When I lean in, twisting the brim of my Lakers cap to the back, she doesn\u2019t pull away. Cradling her head against my shoulder, with the beat pounding through us and the weird sense of privacy provided by the smoky darkness and a few hundred people all focused elsewhere, I kiss her. There\u2019s no script, no film crew, and this is unlike anything we\u2019ve done on camera, where I have to do the leading man thing, choreographed for shadows and camera angles and a hundred other aspects of filming a scene. I slide my tongue across hers and deepen the kiss until I can taste her hesitation melting. When I pull away, her eyes open slowly, staring into mine.</p><p>When we get back to the hotel, I deliver her to her room, kissing her once more, short and sweet\u2014nothing like the kiss during the show\u2014despite the pleasantly evil ideas of everything I\u2019d like to do to her pounding through my head.</p><p>My friend John will be in town tomorrow\u2014he says he\u2019s always wanted to visit Texas and he\u2019s bored as hell in LA. That\u2019s John. Too much money, too much time, no celebrity on his own. I think going out with me is like a drug for him\u2014it\u2019s like he\u2019s famous, too, and he loves it. Guess he needs another hit.</p><p>Tadd and I talked earlier today about going south for a couple of days to go tubing on the Guadalupe river. Disappearing for a couple of days would be a good idea, because this is how girls like Emma operate: they need just enough attention to let them know they\u2019re on your mind. A text or two per day, just on edge of naughty, and she\u2019ll be ready to go by Saturday.</p><p>I think I might like this going slower thing.</p><p>Emma</p><p>All morning, I keep blushing for no apparent reason\u2014every time I think of the fact that I\u2019ve kissed two insanely hot guys in the last two days. I still haven\u2019t heard from Graham. Reid sent me a text this morning wishing me good luck with filming today.</p><p>His fans know where we\u2019re filming, and they showed up early to stand just outside the barricades surrounding the house. But he isn\u2019t filming today, so all but the most tenacious of them eventually trickled away. Chloe and my father are visiting the set this afternoon, and when their taxi arrives, there\u2019s renewed excitement among the dozen or so fans until they exit. Chloe\u2019s outfit today consists of skintight lowrise jeans, wedge heels, and a low-hanging peasant blouse that would look more appropriate on someone in high school. And I don\u2019t mean someone who teaches high school.</p><p>When I go outside to authorize them through set security, a couple of the fans holler, \u201cEmma!\u201d I turn and wave, surprised they know who I am.</p><p>The afternoon\u2019s schedule consists mainly of a scene including Tim Warner and Leslie Neale as Lizbeth\u2019s parents, a fact that sends Chloe into insufferable enthusiasm overdrive. As Tim and Leslie are discussing the interaction they\u2019ll be filming first, Chloe interrupts to tell them how she\u2019s been a huge fan since she was a little girl. Tim stops talking, flabbergasted, and Leslie stares at Chloe for a moment before saying, \u201cThank you dear, and who are you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh! I\u2019m Emma\u2019s mother!\u201d I cringe at both this semi-fabrication and the appalling fact that she\u2019s legitimately connected to me at all.</p><p>As I dream of trap doors and the benefits of quicksand, Leslie and Tim turn towards me, and I try to make myself think screw everyone else even though the last thing I want is for these two distinguished actors to have a poor opinion of me, even if MiShaun is right and it isn\u2019t fair for them to judge me based on Chloe.</p><p>Leslie recovers first. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re proud of her. She\u2019s so talented. At the moment, though, we\u2019ve got to get this scene set up. If you\u2019d just make yourself comfortable and enjoy watching Emma work...\u201d She leads Chloe to a chair off-set and motions to an assistant to the PA, asking her to get Mrs. Pierce something to drink. As she turns from a stunned and silent Chloe, Leslie winks at me.</p><p>I think I love her.</p> <p>At the end of the day, I\u2019m exhausted and running on five or six non-consecutive hours of sleep, but Chloe insists on going out to dinner since they\u2019re leaving early in the morning. I want nothing more than room service, a conversation with Emily about all the kissing going on, and some sleep.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make it an early night,\u201d my father says. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten the chance to tell you how great you were today.\u201d Unable to help myself, I warm under his words, leaning my head on his shoulder as he pats my knee.</p><p>Over dinner at a local barbeque place, Chloe talks about how awesome Leslie was for an hour and a half straight while my father squeezes in a sentence or two praising my performance. In the taxi, I dig my phone from my bag to text Emily. There are two missed calls and two texts from her; the restaurant was so loud that I didn\u2019t hear the phone alerts. The first text says: CALL ME. That\u2019s scary, considering the all caps, but the second, sent half an hour ago, is way more frightening: GOOGLE YOURSELF AND THEN CALL ME.</p><p>Once in my room, I boot up my laptop and type my name into the search box. And there, spread across the Internet, in multiple locations including every Reid Alexander fanpage, are indistinct photos and rampant speculation about Reid Alexander and his current costar, Emma Pierce, who were kissing, offscreen, at a club in Austin.</p><p>Oh. Shit.</p> <p>I\u2019d texted with Emily about the kiss the previous night, but there\u2019s a vast difference in getting the unadorned facts via text, and seeing it in grainy color on a 17-inch monitor, accompanied by assorted enhanced close-ups of the action.</p><p>\u201cI had no idea anyone could even see us. Oh, God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason to panic. Let\u2019s be logical. Okay, Reid Alexander kissed you, for real, not lights-camera-action. And like what practically ninety-nine percent of girls would do if faced with Reid Alexander\u2019s lips, you went for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the problem, exactly, besides the whole thing getting outed to the world? You said he was an amazing kisser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is... but... there\u2019s this, uh, complication I was going to talk to you about tonight, before I knew all of this. Remember the guy I\u2019ve been running with?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGraham, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Well, he kissed me. Monday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, back up. What?\u201d I visualize her waving her hands around. Emily can be on the phone and driving, and she\u2019ll wave both hands around. She says it helps her think. \u201cIs this the same Graham you said was \u2018just a friend\u2019 or some other Graham?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Em. You know sarcasm is my coping mechanism. Go on. Spill it.\u201d</p><p>I curl on my side in the middle of my bed, exactly where Graham and I were. \u201cI\u2019ve felt this... building attraction to him, and we spent all Saturday evening talking, and then we were watching a movie, and I fell asleep and when I woke up he was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo. Talking in bed on Saturday. Interesting. And then Monday, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep, and I knocked on his door, thinking we could talk, or something...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEmma,\u201d Emily says, calling bullshit on me.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, he didn\u2019t answer...\u201d I gulp, anticipating how she\u2019ll react to the next part. \u201cSo I was walking back to my room... and he came out of Brooke\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on. Brooke Cameron, aka Kristen Wells\u2014evil incarnate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily, you know she\u2019s not as horrible in real life as her character on Life\u2019s a Beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet she\u2019s got this Graham guy in her room. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t ask.\u201d Wow, that sounds even worse out loud than it did in my head.</p><p>\u201cEmma, what?\u201d She sighs, and I know she\u2019d shake me if she wasn\u2019t several hundred miles away. \u201cThis kiss took place after he emerged sans explanation from Brooke Cameron\u2019s hotel room?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath and leave out the humiliation of him seeing me run back to my room like a frightened rabbit scurrying for a hole in the fence. \u201cHe came to my room, and we were talking, and then playing around, and somehow we ended up kissing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow you ended up kissing.\u201d I see her dubious expression in my mind\u2019s eye\u2014mouth in a grim line, one eyebrow raised just so.</p><p>\u201cI know. It sounds ridiculous...\u201d</p><p>Emily is quiet, except for the sound of her tapping a pencil against her front teeth, which drives her mom insane. \u201cWell, which of these two guys are you interested in?\u201d</p><p>I think about Graham pushing a strand of hair behind my ear when we\u2019d ducked out of the rainstorm, the feel of his fingers sliding over my skin, how he listened when I talked about losing Mom. I think about the hunger in Reid\u2019s beautiful eyes, the heated difference in his off-screen kiss, and the way he teases me. \u201cI like them both. They\u2019re just... different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that complicates matters. What happens after this film? Do you see either of them being in your life after it\u2019s over? Do you want that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God. I kissed two guys within 24 hours of each other\u2014one in my hotel room and one out in public, and now it\u2019s all over the Internet. What am I gonna do?\u201d I don\u2019t really expect an answer. I\u2019m thinking about running away to join the Peace Corps, which seems more appealing every minute.</p><p>\u201cEmma. Besides looking a wee bit slutty, and let\u2019s face it, most of Hollywood is a little slutty, what are you really worried about?\u201d</p><p>My answer surprises me. \u201cI guess I\u2019m worried that Reid will think we\u2019re a thing... and I\u2019m worried that Graham will think that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t want Graham to think you and Reid are hooking up...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d feel the same if it was the other way around,\u201d I say, while my brain goes you sure about that? and I think YES a little too forcefully and Emily would say methinks thou doth protest too much to if she heard me having this conversation with myself.</p><p>\u201cEven though Graham and Brooke might be hooking up? Hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, one more thing. Graham left Austin sometime during the night after that kiss, and I haven\u2019t seen him or heard from him since then. Some family emergency, I think. But he hasn\u2019t called or texted or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeird,\u201d Emily says, pencil going tic tic tic. \u201cWhat else do you know about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much older?\u201d I hear a prepared-to-be-horrified note in her voice.</p><p>\u201cTwo and a half years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God, I thought you were gonna say he was like thirty or something. Look, I think the reason you\u2019re in this predicament now is you\u2019re letting them determine everything. Maybe you should decide what you want, Em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now I want to come home and hide in your closet.\u201d</p><p>She laughs because that\u2019s exactly what I used to do when Chloe came to pick me up and I didn\u2019t want to go home. \u201cLook, you don\u2019t need either of them. Don\u2019t do anything else until you figure out what you want. Or who you want.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m suddenly extremely homesick for my best friend, my usual routine, and my uncomplicated life\u2014which didn\u2019t include photos of me, locking lips with a bona fide teen idol, splashed across the Internet.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>REID</p><p>John arrived last night. Picking people up at the airport is starting to feel like a second job. Quinton tagged along and we all went out for a late dinner, then back to my room to plot the trip down the Guadalupe, which Bob is none too happy about. He came by the room to tell me he\u2019s sending Jeff and another security guy with us. \u201cIf anybody drowns, it had better be that guy,\u201d he said, pointing at John.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, man?\u201d John blinked. Bob growled at him as he left the room.</p><p>At this point, we\u2019d already put down a load of whiskey sours, so this exchange was hysterical as far as Quinton and I saw it. Tadd joined us around midnight after some don\u2019t-ask-don\u2019t-tell activity, which he usually tells anyway. Especially if we ask.</p><p>I\u2019d intended to be awake early enough to see Emma before we left, but given the level of inebriation that occurred and the fact that it was three a.m. by the time everyone left my room, that didn\u2019t happen. I texted her once we were underway, and she answered when she was on lunch break. I\u2019m less worried about competing with Graham than I was before I kissed her. Never hurts to draw an obvious contrast to potential rivals, though. Especially if it seems to be unintentional:</p><p>Reid: Going tubing for a couple of days with quinton, tadd, and a friend from home. Thought I would tell you and not just disappear. :)</p><p>Emma: What\u2019s tubing?</p><p>Reid: Basically you get in a huge inner tube and float down the river. I will def bring you along next time.</p><p>Emma: Sounds dangerous...</p><p>Reid: Nope, lol. Just fun.</p><p>Emma: K. Have fun. :)</p><p>We rent three cottages and six tubes, and buy as much beer as the coolers can carry. If we\u2019re doing this, we\u2019re doing it all the way. Our assigned bodyguards, Jeff and Ricky, are less unhappy than Bob was about our impromptu excursion. Even though they technically aren\u2019t allowed to drink on the job, we assured them we didn\u2019t consider beer consumption drinking, per se. Plus they\u2019re both legal and can buy the beer.</p><p>\u201cHow do you even know about all this?\u201d Tadd asks, while we meander through a convenience store, all wearing hats and sunglasses, grabbing water shoes, sunblock and mesh nets to hold the empty cans.</p><p>\u201cI used to know somebody who lived in Austin. The locals do this for fun during the summer\u2014I figured we might as well try it while we\u2019re here, right?\u201d</p><p>Brooke is the somebody. Once upon a time, she told me stories about her older sisters, who planned tubing trips with their friends every summer. \u201cThey drink beer all day and float down the river, flirting with boys, and then everyone meets up at a bonfire, where my sisters trade in their Baptist roots to become river whores and hook up with every cute guy they bump into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds fun,\u201d I\u2019d said, and she punched me in the arm.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d We were watching a movie in my trailer, something so boring we\u2019d long since lost interest in favor of making out. At fourteen and fifteen, nobody knew who we were yet, but we wanted the fame, we craved the industry recognition, and we were willing to work like hell to get there. The movie we were filming together then was ultimately a flop, but we weren\u2019t the stars so it didn\u2019t reflect on us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She leaned over and kissed the spot she\u2019d punched. \u201cI don\u2019t want you hooking up with a bunch of girls.\u201d Leaning back, she regarded me with a slight pout, an expression that had, at the time, melted me every time she did it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any other girls,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any other guys,\u201d she answered, leaning closer.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I kissed her, pulling her onto my lap, my hands wandering under her shirt as hers wandered under mine. Maybe that was the first time we went a step further than making out.</p> <p>That conversation went like this: \u201cDo you think\u2014?\u201d</p><p>She looked at me a long moment before nodding. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Emma</p><p>We\u2019re filming at the Bennet house again. Graham and I have the first scene. I don\u2019t know when he returned to Austin, only that I haven\u2019t heard from him in the two and a half days since he kissed me. Meanwhile, the photos of Reid and me at the concert have pretty much gone viral, and considering Graham\u2019s silence, it seems clear enough how he feels about that.</p><p>The kitchen is packed, between craft services people setting up breakfast and snacks, crew members standing around eating, discussing camera angles and scene layouts, and the cast taking bites between bits of line rehearsals. More than once I start to leave the kitchen and go to the living area, where it\u2019s less crowded and noisy, but something keeps me hiding in the throng of people, and I know exactly what that something is.</p> <p>Waiting to see Graham yanks my emotions back and forth, as though I\u2019m either facing a starting gate or a firing squad. I\u2019m as jittery and nauseated as I would be after four cups of coffee. I can\u2019t quite get a grip, giving me five seconds, from the moment I finally hear his voice in the other room, to pull it together.</p><p>Epic. Fail.</p><p>He comes around the corner, sides in hand, talking with Richter, wearing jeans and a rumpled button-down shirt, sleeves rolled and pushed above his elbows. Running a hand through his hair, he glances around the room, his eyes not stopping on anything or anyone until he reaches me. Expression unreadable, he nods once in my direction and turns back to Richter.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you into makeup,\u201d Richter tells him. \u201cFifteen minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I don\u2019t see him again until right before we\u2019re on camera.</p><p>I don\u2019t recognize Graham when he comes back. My concern that they wouldn\u2019t be able to make him look goofy enough for Bill Collins was dead wrong. His hair is slicked back with gel and he\u2019s wearing pleated khaki pants, a coral golf shirt\u2014tucked in\u2014and a pair of gold-framed glasses with spherical lenses. His walk and his mannerisms are timid, yet self-important. He\u2019s perfect.</p> <p>We\u2019re filming the absurd proposal scene between Bill and Lizbeth. The assistant director lays out the scene and we listen without looking at each other. Graham hasn\u2019t looked at me after that first glance, though he\u2019ll be contractually obligated to in a few minutes. I would have felt so comfortable doing this scene a week ago, before he kissed me, before he disappeared and returned not speaking to me.</p><p>\u201cAction,\u201d Richter says.</p><p>INT. Bennet Kitchen \u2013 Day</p><p>LIZBETH is loading dishes into the dishwasher as BILL walks in from the dining room with a stack of plates.</p><p>BILL</p><p>Lizbeth, I have something to ask you.</p><p>LIZBETH</p><p>(taking dishes from him, rinsing them in the sink)</p> <p>Yes?</p><p>BILL</p><p>As you know, I am an integral part of the Rosings firm, with a lucrative career in front of me.</p><p>LIZBETH</p><p>(rolling eyes to the side)</p><p>Yes, so you\u2019ve said.</p><p>BILL</p><p>My boss, Ms. DeBourgh, believes that a man in my position is best suited to an advantageous career if he is settled down, domestically speaking.</p><p>LIZBETH frowns.</p><p>BILL</p><p>So, I\u2019m asking you, Lizbeth Bennet, to marry me.</p><p>LIZBETH swivels to face him, dropping a plate into the sink where it clatters and breaks.</p><p>(The expression on Graham\u2019s face is so guarded that I have a difficult time staying in character\u2014Bill Collins is supposed to be comic relief. Graham seems... angry.)</p><p>LIZBETH</p><p>(incredulous)</p><p>But. But. I\u2019m in high school.</p><p>(I\u2019m determined to fix that parenthetical incredulous expression on my face. I try to focus on his ridiculous glasses, the stupid slicked-back hair, anything. Nothing works.)</p><p>BILL</p><p>The engagement won\u2019t be official until you\u2019re eighteen, but that needn\u2019t stop us from planning.</p><p>(He sounds much too persuasive to be the idiotic Bill Collins; even his nasally whine is absent. Richter is going to notice; everyone is going to notice. Suddenly I\u2019m livid.)</p><p>LIZBETH</p><p>(stunned)</p><p>Are you insane?</p><p>BILL</p><p>(laughing carelessly)</p><p>Girls are all such teases. It\u2019s nearly impossible for a guy to know where he stands!</p><p>(And I\u2019m blushing again...)</p><p>LIZBETH</p><p>(horrified)</p><p>I am not being a tease. If I\u2019ve done something to make you think I\u2019m interested, well, I\u2019m sorry. My answer is still no.</p><p>BILL</p><p>You don\u2019t need to worry about the choice of ring, by the way. I didn\u2019t purchase one yet because I wanted to make sure you had your choice.</p><p>LIZBETH</p><p>You didn\u2019t even know me a month ago. You couldn\u2019t possibly have come here intending to just fall in love with someone you don\u2019t even know?</p><p>(My voice cracks and I can\u2019t keep my lip from quivering. Dammit.)</p><p>BILL</p><p>It\u2019s true, I didn\u2019t know you, but I had every intention of making up for my dad\u2019s mismanagement of Bennet Inc. by hooking up, legitimately of course, with you. I knew you were beautiful. I was sure I would feel a connection. And I did.</p><p>(Graham is staring into my eyes, and I have trouble remembering my lines.)</p><p>LIZBETH</p><p>(slinging soapy water into the sink)</p><p>This is crazy. I\u2019m not getting married to anyone, certainly not to you.</p><p>\u201cCut,\u201d Richter says, and I can tell he\u2019s less than happy. He eyes Graham and me, his hand over his mouth, as though he wants to make sure not to say anything until he knows exactly what he means to say. \u201cEveryone but Emma and Graham take five.\u201d Crap. \u201cOn second thought, make it ten.\u201d Oh, crap.</p><p>Our accomplished director leans a hip on the table and crosses his arms over his chest, regarding the two of us. I imagine this is what it feels like to be called to the principal\u2019s office for fighting or talking in class. Graham and I both look anywhere but at Richter or each other.</p><p>\u201cSo. Graham,\u201d Richter begins. \u201cYou realize your guy is a silly, shallow character?\u201d</p><p>Graham nods, crossing his arms over his chest, too. Defensive response, as any actor knows.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s with the brooding stares? You\u2019ve been spot on playing this guy as clueless and superficial. And now, he\u2019s staring at Lizbeth as though he\u2019s deciding whether to kick a chair across the room or throw her over his shoulder and retreat to his cave.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m blushing again\u2014throw her over his shoulder\u2014and Graham is silent for a full minute. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he answers, arms loosening, one hand gripping the countertop while he almost runs the other through his hair, stopping when he realizes it\u2019s gelled back. \u201cIf I could have a few minutes, I\u2019ll get into character. I\u2019m a little off today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Take ten minutes. Be ready to reshoot, but let me know if you need longer.\u201d</p><p>Graham nods and leaves the room without looking at me.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay between you two?\u201d Richter asks when Graham is gone.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d What else can I say?</p><p>\u201cWell. I think you were responding to Graham\u2019s lead in that last take. Remember that Lizbeth isn\u2019t angry. She\u2019s shocked and incredulous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ll get it right next take. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a few minutes and we\u2019ll hit take two.\u201d</p><p>We film the scene again, and Graham has pulled himself completely into character. We do several partial scenes and a few minor retakes. Richter wasn\u2019t far off, though I should have been professional enough to stay in character, and I can\u2019t blame Graham completely. \u201cPerfect,\u201d Richter says. \u201cLet\u2019s take a break, and we\u2019ll come back and do the next bit with the Bennet family.\u201d Graham walks out the front door dialing his cell.</p><p>The last scene before lunch, which doesn\u2019t include Graham, goes well. When we\u2019re done, I turn and he\u2019s leaning against a door jamb, watching me. We lock eyes briefly before the PA claims his attention. I don\u2019t know if that kiss meant anything to him, or if it was a regretted impulse. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m interrupting something between Graham and Brooke that has nothing to do with me. He\u2019s seen the photos of Reid and me, or at least knows about them, and I hate that he\u2019s angry, or hurt, or disgusted. I hate that we aren\u2019t talking.</p><p>Taking a turkey sandwich, a Diet Coke, and this afternoon\u2019s sides, I go out back to the covered patio. The weather is hot, but in the shade it\u2019s passably warm. When the door opens behind me, I hope it isn\u2019t someone from makeup, since they\u2019ll have to touch up anything that gets shiny, which is inevitable now that I\u2019m hiding out in the heat.</p><p>\u201cHey, Emma,\u201d Graham says, walking around the cushioned bench where I sit and taking the seat opposite me. He sets a bottle of water on the low table and reaches into his pocket for his pack and lighter.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting the patches tomorrow, as soon as we\u2019re done filming,\u201d he says, tapping a cigarette out of the nearly empty package, lighting the end. Taking a drag, he stores the pack and lighter away, leans back, exhales above our heads. \u201cThat way I start when I\u2019m not filming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bought the patches, then?\u201d Hearing his voice makes me happy. Just knowing he doesn\u2019t hate me is a relief.</p><p>\u201cYeah. When I was in New York.\u201d He doesn\u2019t elaborate, taking another drag on the cigarette and looking out over the parched yard.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay... with your trip to New York? Someone said you had a family emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yeah, everything\u2019s fine,\u201d he says, falling silent again.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Well. Good.\u201d I look back down at the sheet in my hand, not sure what to say now that he\u2019s here. I\u2019ve forgotten how Graham is with silences, though. He\u2019s comfortable in them, never determined to fill them unless he has something to say.</p><p>He finishes his cigarette and starts another before he speaks. \u201cSorry for earlier, getting you bitched out with me. I was just really off today, for some reason.\u201d His eyes are sincere, the earlier judgment in them dissolved, gone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I was off, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. I wanted to apologize. Actors tend to play off of each other in a scene, and I really screwed up the first time around.\u201d He starts to run a hand through his hair again and stops abruptly, yanking his hand down and taking a last long drag, like his nicotine cravings know that he and cigarettes are about to go their separate ways, and they want to stock up.</p><p>I can\u2019t help smiling at him. \u201cThat stuff in your hair is driving you crazy, isn\u2019t it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grins back at me. \u201cMan, you don\u2019t even know. I had no idea how often I touched my hair until all of a sudden I can\u2019t. This stuff feels like glue.\u201d</p><p>I eat the last bite of my sandwich and finish the Diet Coke while he smokes. I fiddle with the wrapper, wad it up and balance it on top of the empty can.</p><p>\u201cHave you been running, while I was gone?\u201d</p><p>I look up at him. \u201cI skipped one day, but I ran today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGoing tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was planning to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind if I join you? I haven\u2019t done so much as a pushup since we ran last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>The PA pokes his head out the door. \u201cFive minutes, Emma.\u201d</p> <p>At the end of filming, Graham leaves the set without speaking to anyone but Richter. I want to talk to him again, but I feel so guilty over kissing Reid that I lose my nerve any time I consider initiating a conversation. And then I think of Brooke, and I\u2019m not sure if I have anything to feel guilty for.</p><p>Reid: Hey, just thinking about you and wanted to say hi</p><p>Me: Hi back. Having fun? Using sunscreen?</p><p>Reid: Yes... and yes... but after that many hours in the sun, I may come back saturday a little pinker anyway.</p><p>Me: Lol. See you then.</p><p>Reid: Hope so ;)</p> <p>Chapter 23</p><p>REID</p><p>Brooke got one thing right: river whores.</p><p>I\u2019m talking about the guys and me, of course. The past two days have consisted of watching for hours as groups of girls float nearby with their tubes hooked together, clad in bikinis and frayed denim shorts with straw cowboy hats or baseball caps shielding their faces. Last night was after-hours partying and inviting a few girls (and a couple of guys\u2014Tadd\u2019s no more angelic than the rest of us) back to the cottages. Being on this river the past couple of days, I remember what made Brooke so fascinating.</p><p>I grew up in LA, and thanks to a multitude of factors including Dad\u2019s career trajectory, Mom\u2019s ancestry, and their collective net worth, I\u2019ve run in exclusive circles my whole life. The majority of women in those circles of southern California, and their daughters, have a look. An untouchable beauty, a not-quite-real quality, everything pampered and flawless. My mother has this look, as do her friends. The socialites, the actresses, the wannabes, they all have it.</p><p>When I met Brooke, she was fifteen and new to California. She\u2019d been discovered in Texas\u2014in Austin, in fact, and she was so raw and fresh and different, she took my breath away. She was beautiful, but natural. Her hair wasn\u2019t highlighted, and she wore no makeup off set. She had tan lines from laying out at the community pool and muscles from playing soccer since she was five. Since she\u2019d grown up in a relatively large city, her accent was mild, but definitely there.</p><p>She\u2019d confessed that her manager was sending her to speech classes to lose her \u201chorrible drawl.\u201d I remember telling her that was the most idiotic thing I\u2019d ever heard, but when I begged her not to go, she\u2019d laughed and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to sound like some brainless hick, do you?\u201d That was just the first thing LA changed about her. Now she\u2019s as perfect and soulless as the others there. Not that I can talk.</p><p>The girls here all have her former accent, in various concentrations. In some, every other word is y\u2019all. Others just soften syllables and liaise words. All of them tend to drop any g at the end of any word.</p> <p>A few of them figured out who we are. Not difficult when we\u2019re all together like this, which is what had Bob freaked out. When I\u2019m outside LA by myself or with John, I sometimes get away with saying, \u201cYeah, I get that all the time,\u201d if someone discovers who I am. With Quinton and Tadd along, it\u2019s nearly impossible. Hats and sunglasses help, but a few people know our identities despite the camouflage.</p><p>The last thing I need in my campaign to win Emma over all the way is photos of me with other girls popping up tomorrow on the Internet. Wherever there are cameras, or wherever cameras might be, I\u2019m doing no more than hanging out with the guys, maybe a little drinking, a little dancing. Anyone following me into the cottage is subject to leaving all personal items with Jeff and Ricky. One girl objected, which was no big deal\u2014Ricky just escorted her back to her friends\u2019 campsite. Her friend, on the other hand, surrendered her bag and phone to Jeff and asked if she needed to give him her clothes, too. I told her no, she and I would take care of that ourselves.</p><p>Emma</p><p>\u201cSo what, exactly, are the boys doing?\u201d MiShaun asks over dinner Friday night.</p><p>\u201cThey went tubing.\u201d Brooke answers.</p><p>\u201cPardon me?\u201d MiShaun says, one eyebrow raised.</p><p>\u201cA shallow, slow-moving river, inner tubes\u2014like from tires\u2014and a day of doing nothing but floating downstream. Add beer and girls in bikinis and it\u2019s a guy\u2019s wet dream. Ha, ha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a guaranteed sunburn to me,\u201d Jenna says.</p><p>MiShaun agrees. \u201cRichter will have their hides if they come back looking like well-done lobsters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, are you Brooke Cameron? From Life\u2019s a Beach?\u201d Two girls stand hesitantly by our table, apprehensive but determined.</p><p>Brooke turns, a wide smile replacing her blas\u00e9 expression. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we love you!\u201d the second girl says while the first nods. \u201cYou\u2019re so bitchy and awesome!\u201d Both girls blanch. \u201cI mean, I know Kirsten is just your character, that you aren\u2019t really, uh\u2014.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014I strive for bitchy and awesome.\u201d She laughs and they relax. \u201cWould you like to take a picture or something?\u201d A whirlwind of activity occurs as the two fans dig their phones out of their bags.</p><p>The rest of us slide looks towards each other that say Who is this person?</p><p>While Jenna takes a photo of Brooke with one of her fans, the other girl glances around the table. \u201cOhmigod, MiShaun Grant! Wow, you guys are friends? That\u2019s so cool!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in Austin filming a movie,\u201d Brooke says, motioning for the second girl to get into the photo Jenna is about to take.</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d That\u2019s when they recognize me. I don\u2019t know if they think they\u2019re being subtle, or if they don\u2019t care. They stare and whisper behind their hands. \u201cWait. Hold on. Are you talking about the movie with Reid Alexander?\u201d Both girls scan the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Brooke says, a new edge to her voice. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not here.\u201d Meredith and I exchange another look.</p><p>Their disappointment is palpable. \u201cCan we at least get a photo with you, too?\u201d one of them asks MiShaun, who flashes Meredith and me a smirk.</p><p>\u201cSure thing. Always happy to do impromptu photo ops with my adoring fans.\u201d Her sarcastic tone is gently veiled by the words. Meredith bites the inside of her cheek and examines her silverware as I cough-laugh into my napkin. MiShaun leans towards the fans, smiling, while Jenna snaps the photos. The photo requests are repeated with me, and suddenly I can hardly wait to get back to the hotel.</p><p>\u201cYou girls have a nice evening,\u201d Brooke dismisses the two girls and turns back to Jenna as though they\u2019d been interrupted in the middle of a scintillating conversation.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d Brooke says as they walk away, \u201cReid\u2019s a pain in the ass even when he isn\u2019t around.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>REID</p><p>John\u2019s CEO father called last night and ordered him home. Apparently he has orientation for college starting Monday morning, and he\u2019s supposed to check in tomorrow. Oops.</p><p>No matter how loud and intimidating my dad is, he doesn\u2019t compare to John\u2019s dad, a CEO who handles everyone he encounters, no matter who they are, as though they work for him. That includes John, who nicknamed him the Dark Lord when we were sixteen. John doesn\u2019t work and is completely financially dependent, so when the Dark Lord says jump, he jumps.</p><p>John and I are sharing one of the cottages, and he knocked on my bedroom door at, shall we say, aninopportune moment last night. The girl\u2014let\u2019s call her Macy because I like that name and I can\u2019t recall her real name\u2014shot up like she\u2019d been hit with a jumper cable.</p><p>\u201cJesus. What?\u201d I called, annoyed.</p><p>\u201cHey man, a minute,\u201d John said on the other side of the door.</p><p>I glanced at Macy, who was mostly undressed but looked like she might bolt. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d I put one finger on her sternum and pushed her slowly back down, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s just my dumbass friend. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>I padded across the small room, shirtless, jeans unzipped, and cracked open the door. \u201cWhat the hell do you want, man? I know you had more condoms that you could use in a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad just called. I, uh, have to be home tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn a ten a.m. flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cNevermind. I\u2019ll text Jeff\u2014God knows I\u2019m not disturbing him right now. He\u2019d kick your ass, only because he\u2019s not allowed to kick mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s kinda why I didn\u2019t knock on his door...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll handle it. Now leave me the hell alone the rest of the night. Seriously.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, man. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d I shut the door with a snap, locked it and turned, grabbing my phone from the rickety dresser and tapping a message to Jeff, Tadd and Quinton as I walked towards the bed, staring at Macy. \u201cWhere were we?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a flurry of activity this morning to get out of here before eight. Macy\u2019s just been coaxed into one of three taxis, looking severely hungover and pouting that I\u2019m leaving. There\u2019s no reason to tell her that my leaving has nothing to do with putting her in a taxi this morning. No offense to hot girls everywhere\u2014but newsflash\u2014there are hot girls everywhere. I don\u2019t do seconds.</p><p>I\u2019m not including Emma with that\u2014she\u2019s not a one-nighter. I assume she\u2019ll keep me happily occupied for the duration of filming. Maybe longer, who knows. If you mess around with costars, there\u2019s generally an assumption of being a couple, at least temporarily. I don\u2019t believe in love, and even though my parents have been married forever, I don\u2019t believe in marriage either. They just exist and rotate around each other\u2019s lives. There\u2019s no emotional relationship there. It\u2019s a social, fiscal relationship. That\u2019s not for me and never will be.</p><p>I don\u2019t lie to girls like Macy (whose name is Tracy, by the way\u2014I was close). If she goes into something like last night assuming a relationship might come out the other end\u2014and I don\u2019t care if we\u2019re talking about me or John or any guy\u2014she\u2019s fooling herself. It has nothing to do with a lack of respect or any of that shit they try to scare girls with. It\u2019s way more simple than that.</p><p>If I met you last night, and brought you back to my place, or followed you to yours, and we had sex, that\u2019s what we asked for from each other. It\u2019s what I got, and what you got. I don\u2019t know you. You don\u2019t know me. Thanks for playing, and we\u2019re done. If by some fluke anything was said at some point during this entire exchange that made me curious enough to see you again, I would. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Has that happened before? A couple of times. Did it last? Clearly, no.</p><p>Emma</p><p>Graham and I barely spoke yesterday morning while we ran, and at lunch he was running lines with MiShaun while I worked with Tim and Leslie. I don\u2019t know what he did last night while the girls went out.</p><p>This morning, he hasn\u2019t spoken since murmuring, \u201cGood morning,\u201d in the lobby, and we\u2019re almost halfway through our regular trail. In contrast to our comfortable silences, this quiet is awkward, as though there are words in our mouths, trapped. There\u2019s no sound beyond our separate strides synchronizing to a singular, rhythmic footfall, the reverberations from the engine of a small plane circling above\u2014a car dealership ad promising NO DOWN PAYMENT! undulating behind, and the drone of cars on a nearby street.</p> <p>After another five minutes, I can\u2019t take the disconnection any longer. Any conversation, no matter how dull, would be better than this uncomfortable void. \u201cAny nicotine cravings yet?\u201d</p><p>I read relief in his glance, in the way his shoulders relax, like he was waiting for me to speak while I was waiting for him. \u201cI\u2019m actually still buzzing from the patch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you put it?\u201d</p><p>He pulls back the sleeve of his t-shirt to reveal the patch, stuck to his more-muscular-than-I\u2019d-realized-before bicep. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to put it in a new spot every time, I guess to give the skin a rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d I say, hearing myself the second it leaves my mouth. A moment passes, and I wonder if he\u2019ll say anything.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve grown careless in my absence. What are we up to now? Forty or so?\u201d</p><p>I shove him, inexplicably pleased that he hasn\u2019t given up teasing me, and he laughs, swerving off the path for no more than two steps. \u201cPeace, girl, chill! You\u2019re still under ten. But we\u2019re on the honor system here, so you\u2019ll have to let me know if you start racking up penalties when I\u2019m not around.\u201d</p><p>I pretend to scowl.</p><p>\u201cHey, you know I\u2019m just messing with you, right? I really don\u2019t care if you use \u2018huh\u2019 in every third sentence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I pout. \u201cSeems like it really bugs you.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cNah. It would take a lot more than that for you to get on my nerves.\u201d</p> <p>We exit the elevator on the fourth floor to the energetic banter of our costars, who\u2019ve returned from the tubing trip. Quinton is kneeling on the floor, digging through his bag, clothes strewn all around it, while Reid and Tadd stand nearby, watching him. \u201cI know that damned card is here somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call down to the front desk; they\u2019ll send someone up with a new one,\u201d Tadd offers.</p><p>\u201cDude it was just here, I saw it this morning as I was packing...\u201d</p><p>When Graham and I come into sight, Reid\u2019s more tanned (somewhat pink) face lights up. \u201cEmma!\u201d he says, as though we haven\u2019t seen each other for weeks.</p><p>He walks straight over and puts his arms around me, twirling me around once, leaving one arm around my waist as he says, \u201cHey, Graham,\u201d and sticks out his hand. Graham shakes it without comment. \u201cToo bad you couldn\u2019t make it, man, it was awesome. Nothing to do all day but drink and float.\u201d</p><p>He looks down at me. \u201cAren\u2019t you the cutest thing in this little tank and shorts combo. Out exercising early, eh?\u201d Before I can form an answer, he leans in and kisses me.</p><p>The kiss isn\u2019t more than a peck, not more than a split-second meeting of our lips, and is nothing like the passionate kiss three nights ago, but the action holds unmistakable familiarity. Graham\u2019s face is void of expression as he turns towards his door. When I\u2019m free from Reid\u2019s embrace, I walk across the hall and push my key card into my door, annoyed at Reid for claiming me with that kiss, annoyed at Graham for surrendering so easily.</p><p>\u201cAh-ha!\u201d Quinton locates his key card at the very bottom of his bag.</p> <p>\u201cHey, let\u2019s all go out tonight,\u201d Reid suggests.</p><p>\u201cI need a nap first,\u201d Tadd says, yawning. \u201cA long freaking nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only like 10 a.m.\u201d Reid punches his arm and dodges away. \u201cYou can get a full eight hours of beauty rest and still have plenty of time to put on your makeup.\u201d</p><p>Tadd lunges forward and trips over a mound of clothing, and Quinton recoils, saying, \u201cMan, I am in serious need of some adult company,\u201d as they crash to the ground, rolling and laughing like five-year-olds.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tadd rolls off of Reid, his innocent expression contradicted by the leg he immediately sticks out to trip Reid as he rises.</p><p>My door unlocks and I push it open as Reid says, \u201cSee you tonight, Emma?\u201d</p><p>He has no idea what he just did. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. I\u2019ll text everyone; we can all meet up and go together.\u201d</p><p>Graham is already in his room, his door shutting with a soft click.</p><p>I spend the afternoon in my room, finishing a novel that leaves me depressed as hell. The main character is giving a party, and the entire story is the day leading up to the party. But all during that day, as she\u2019s getting everything prepared for this party, she\u2019s recalling her past, and the people who\u2019ll be attending: one guy in particular, someone who was in love with her years and years before, someone she didn\u2019t choose. And it\u2019s not like she\u2019s miserable; it\u2019s worse, like she sometimes feels dead inside. At least that\u2019s what I got from it.</p><p>Reading a story like that makes you either want to go out and party or stay in to contemplate slitting your wrists.</p><p>I\u2019m still deciding.</p><p>Me: Everyone going out tonight, prepare for compromising internet photos tomorrow. Still confused. Call when you get a break?</p><p>Em: Trying to feel sorry for you... 2 hot guys, 1 you...</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m on dinner break. Jasper gave me a whole twenty minutes,\u201d Emily says when I answer. \u201cGod, today\u2019s been a nightmare. Some of Derek\u2019s anti-Goth friends strolled through the store to check me out, and I didn\u2019t disappoint. You know how I dress when I\u2019m working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on a sec.\u201d I hear her ordering a slice of pizza and a lemonade, the buzz of hundreds of conversations and the squeals of children in the background. I can almost smell the oregano and tomato sauce of the food court pizza place, mixing with the aroma of constantly frying baskets of French fries at the Hot-Dog-on-a-Stick next door. It feels like months since Emily and I were there together, contemplating my looming celebrity.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m back. So. What are you more hesitant about, how you feel about Reid, or how he feels about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really how he feels, but what it means, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the \u2018What are your intensions, Mr. Alexander?\u2019 kind of what it \u2018means\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo nineteenth century?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKinda. Plus this isn\u2019t some tool who works at the Gap, this is Reid Alexander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And I\u2019m 17, not 35. It\u2019s not like I need promises of forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because you don\u2019t want somebody to pull the rug out from under you doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re asking for forever. You\u2019ve had enough grief, Em. I\u2019ve always wondered how I turned out to be the one who pens binders of melancholic poetry, for chrissake.\u201d</p><p>My father and I never talk about how my mother died.</p><p>It was cancer, and it was quick. What I\u2019ve deduced in the past eleven years: she was too young to have known to start looking; there was no family history, no pressing need to be diligent about checkups. The malignant cells were masters at camouflage, with so few telltale signs that photos of her, taken mere months before she died, didn\u2019t contain a single warning. I know. I looked. She appeared healthy and beautiful, but appearances lie.</p><p>The discovery was accidental. Her dentist, troubled about the amount of blood loss she sustained from a simple dental procedure, badgered her to go see her doctor. She gave in to shut him up, and I picture her getting the phone call two or three days later, sitting down hard at the kitchen table, speechless.</p><p>I was a child, so the truth was kept from me until there was no avoiding it. I don\u2019t know how long I had with her, from the knowledge that I was losing her to the moment she was gone. I have a few strong memories from that time. In the hospital, the tubes and needles that seemed to anchor her to the bed scared the living daylights out of me. Once home, she lay propped in the center of her bed with so many pillows that she seemed to be floating on a cloud of them. Six-year-old reasoning told me that being home meant she was getting better. Bits and pieces of the funeral are vivid. I cried because my father did, because my grandmother did, because everyone did, even the priest, and because my mother wasn\u2019t there to console me, and I didn\u2019t completely understand why.</p><p>My grandmother moved in for a week or two, but she finally had to go back to work. She lived nearby, and she became the one I turned to most often when I missed my mother, the one who felt it like I did. Like a giant hole had opened in the middle of my chest, and nothing would ever fill it.</p><p>My father was so completely withdrawn and silent after Mom was gone that I began to forget that he was ever easygoing and cheerful. I forgot the way we had chased each other around the house, our food fights, and how he\u2019d get me to help him wash his car and I\u2019d splash him with a bucketful of soapy water. He\u2019d spray me with the hose, and Mom would put her hands on her hips and say, \u201cConnor, I swear to God, I am a single mother of two.\u201d Mouth turned down, eyes big and blinking, he would do what she called his puppy dog look, holding my hand while I mimicked his expression, and she\u2019d throw her hands up in surrender, walking away, hiding her smile. He\u2019d stage-whisper, \u201cShe\u2019s no match for our green-eyed charm.\u201d</p><p>For a brief time, when he began seeing Chloe, he was like that again\u2014happy. He looked at me instead of through me. And then at some point he belonged to her, and even if he was still there in my life, it was like we\u2019d come apart. I was outside of his embrace again, fighting in vain for a way back in that I never found.</p><p>They married thirteen months after my mother died.</p><p>I know my father loves me, in his own way. That\u2019s how they say it: He loves you in his own way. Well, what about my way? What if I need for him to love me in my way?</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>REID</p><p>Everyone meets in the lobby for tonight\u2019s outing, including Brooke and Graham, who stand inches apart, speaking quietly. I take Emma\u2019s hand and lead her to the first taxi, Bob following us, everyone else taking the two remaining cars. Not many photographers out tonight\u2014they probably didn\u2019t know I\u2019d come back from New Braunfels since we got in so early and I didn\u2019t leave the hotel today.</p><p>Emma\u2019s wearing a little black dress, straps criss-crossing over her shoulders and meeting the dress halfway down her back. Her shoes look like funky heeled Mary Janes, very schoolgirl, totally hot. Continuing that theme, her hair is swept into a high ponytail. I have a weakness for ponytails\u2014something about the bareness of the nape, the innocent feminine look of it. \u201cYou look adorable tonight,\u201d I tell her, and she smiles into her lap before glancing up at me. When I hold my hand out, palm up, she takes it. Her hand is small, delicate, absolutely feminine, and this awareness makes me want her even more. \u201cCool ring. Princess cut diamond\u2014I like it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Her finger brushes over it. I get the feeling there\u2019s a story behind that ring, but for whatever reason, she\u2019s not ready to share it.</p><p>The club has a VIP area in a loft overlooking the dance floor. We commandeer the space, pushing the low tables together in the center with four sofas surrounding them. Brooke plops next to Graham, across from Emma and me, leaning into him to whisper something. I keep a peripheral eye on Emma to see if she\u2019s watching them. She was definitely tense this morning after I kissed her in the hallway in front of him. Did it feel like I was marking my territory? Unfortunately, yes. Did it feel necessary at the time? Also yes.</p><p>My arm rests behind her now, and we\u2019re sitting close enough that our thighs brush with the slightest pressure. Everyone orders drinks while Tadd, Quinton and I talk about the parts of our trip we can discuss in mixed company.</p><p>\u201cLook at this.\u201d Tadd pulls up the leg of his jeans to show a huge purpling bruise on his shin. \u201cStupid invisible underwater branch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDude, I thought the Guadalupe had an alligator,\u201d Quinton says. \u201cYou screamed like a little girl until you saw it was just a stick and started cursing like a strung-out ho.\u201d</p><p>Tadd smoothes the fabric over his leg carefully and points at Quinton. \u201cLike you didn\u2019t launch yourself outta that tube like a rocket when that fish bit your ass.\u201d</p><p>My hand moves to Emma\u2019s bare neck, massaging lightly as she laughs with everyone else.</p><p>\u201cNo one warned me there were carnivorous fish in that damned river!\u201d Quinton says.</p><p>\u201cReid and I didn\u2019t get so much as nibbled. It was all Quinton,\u201d Tadd says.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re just jealous that none of them wanted a piece of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the reason.\u201d</p><p>A new song comes on and I stand up, taking Emma\u2019s hand. \u201cLet\u2019s dance.\u201d She allows herself to be pulled up, and Meredith and Tadd decide to follow us.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you can hit the floor after that life-threatening injury?\u201d Quinton quips.</p><p>Tadd flips him off and keeps walking.</p><p>Emma</p> <p>I don\u2019t look at Graham as Reid and I move to the stairs and start down. Even with the dim lighting, descending the staircase is like entering a debutante\u2019s ball. Practically everyone downstairs looks up to see who\u2019s coming down. At least half of them seem to recognize Reid. One bodyguard shadows us, and another waits just off the dance floor.</p><p>Reid is either oblivious or faking oblivion; more likely the latter. Clad in a blue t-shirt that exactly matches his eyes, a pair of jeans that fit him like they\u2019re custom made, and worn-in cowboy boots, he\u2019s a living breathing incarnation of male beauty. He\u2019s every bit the guy in an Armani suit on the cover of GQ, with a spread inside in which he sports a tight black tank, doing pull-ups on a tree branch, showing off his enviable biceps and shoulders.</p><p>He pulls me into his arms on the floor, ignoring the fast tempo of the song and swaying slowly, dragging my arms up and around his neck. Bending to my ear, he says, \u201cDon\u2019t be scared, I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look afraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm.\u201d He smiles down at me, resting his forehead on mine, his hands on my lower back, pressing me closer. \u201cPositively terrified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more brave than I look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to know.\u201d He pulls me deeper into the crowd, which parts for us. The bodyguards look nervous, but Reid acts as though we\u2019re the only people on the floor, and everyone else allows it. This boy could charm just about anything out of anyone, and he\u2019s quite conscious of that fact. Just another reason for my apprehension.</p><p>I try not to think of Graham upstairs. I\u2019m convinced he left my room the other night because of Brooke. They\u2019re probably already involved, possibly they have been for a while. Maybe they argued, maybe he just slipped\u2014our kiss was a mistake and nothing more. He\u2019s become a good friend. I like talking to him and running with him, the way he teases me, the way he seems to look out for me. Trying to turn it into anything further will ruin it.</p> <p>That\u2019s what I tell myself, locked in Reid\u2019s arms, dancing within a crowd of people as though no one else exists. But Reid and I will never be invisible, as much as we might pretend it, and I never feel like everyone else disappears. I feel them staring, the whole time we\u2019re on the floor, like they can see right through me.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to the caf\u00e9, get some coffee. I\u2019m not ready to go up yet,\u201d Reid says quietly to me as we enter the hotel hours later in groups of two and three. We\u2019re last in.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to ask anyone else\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had enough of everyone else for one night.\u201d Holding one finger to his lips, he pulls me towards the caf\u00e9, out of sight of the elevator.</p><p>He asks for a booth by the window and slides in beside me instead of across. We order coffee and share a slice of cheesecake, most of which he eats. I\u2019m still trying to work off that cake I shared with Graham.</p><p>Don\u2019t think of Graham.</p><p>There are still people in the street, and we watch them parade by. \u201cI like watching people making idiots of themselves, like that guy.\u201d He points to someone performing a drunken dance for a few friends who are attempting, unsuccessfully, to stop him. \u201cOr fall in love, like those two.\u201d A couple standing under a streetlamp are kissing passionately enough to make me blush.</p><p>\u201cMe too. I like getting to be the audience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he says then, his fingers on my chin, turning my face. He kisses me lightly, at first. And then his arms slip around me, one hand moving from my lower back to my hip to my thigh, his mouth more urgent. Finally he leans his forehead against mine like he did at the club, his eyes closed as our breathing slows.</p><p>\u201cCome to my room with me?\u201d He asks so softly that I\u2019m almost unsure he said it. His meaning is clear. Crystal.</p><p>\u201cI... I don\u2019t know, Reid...\u201d My mind is casting about for some response, not wanting to push him away, but not ready for what he\u2019s asking.</p><p>\u201cI just want to kiss you, nothing more.\u201d He laughs softly. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s entirely untrue. What I mean is, there will be nothing more, if it\u2019s too soon for you. Just please, let me kiss you in a room where there isn\u2019t a waiter hovering or a camera rolling or a million people watching.\u201d</p><p>I nod, and he slaps a fifty on the table for what is probably a twelve dollar ticket, takes my hand and tucks it under his arm as we walk across to the caf\u00e9 exit and to the elevators.</p><p>When the doors open, he sticks his head out first, glancing one way and then the other, as though we\u2019re spies. Or fugitives. The hallway is deserted. We dash to his room, giggling. His room key is in his hand and in a matter of seconds we\u2019re in, and he\u2019s letting the door swing shut behind us and locking it. I\u2019m not giggling anymore, and neither is he.</p><p>\u201cDo you want something to drink?\u201d</p><p>I feel dry-mouthed and nervous. \u201cWater?\u201d For a moment I feel silly; it isn\u2019t like I\u2019ve never made out with anyone before. And then I remember that I\u2019m alone in a hotel room with Reid Alexander.</p><p>\u201cComing right up. Make yourself at home.\u201d His room is a suite with a king-sized bed dominating one wall, a sitting area with a sofa and two chairs, a bar, and French doors at the south-facing balcony. There are fresh cut flowers in the middle of the dresser, and dry-cleaning bags hanging on the closet door. I perch in the middle of the sofa.</p><p>He brings two bottled waters from the bar fridge, hands me one as he sits next to me, leaning into the corner of the sofa, leaving several inches of space between us. My anxiety is building rather than decreasing, but I\u2019m not sure how to calm myself.</p><p>For no good reason I recall how comfortable I felt with Graham in my room.</p><p>Don\u2019t think about Graham.</p><p>\u201cEmma.\u201d Reid leans up to place his bottle on the coffee table, and fixes me with the smoldering stare I recognize from every magazine spread he\u2019s done in the last two years. The difference is this look is real, in person, and directed at me. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>I place my bottle next to his and move closer, until our knees are touching. He kisses me softly, one hand on my waist, the heel of his hand pressed to my ribcage. Some minutes later, he stands, pulls me up by both hands and puts my arms around his neck as he had on the dance floor. Kissing me again, he lifts me by the hips, settles my legs around his torso and sits back down, never breaking the contact of his mouth on mine. We kiss for five minutes, ten, fifteen, I have no idea. When I finally break away, as breathless as if I\u2019d run a mile, his mouth moves to my neck, kissing an erratic pathway to my ear.</p><p>Kneading my lower back with one hand while the other cups the base of my skull, he runs his fingertips from my shoulders to my hands, back and forth, finally circling my wrists with his hands, pulling my hands to lay on his chest. I feel his heartbeat under my palm, and his hands move to my thighs.</p><p>\u201cAre you very sure,\u201d his lips blaze a path from my chin to the base of my throat and my hands grip his biceps as though I\u2019m suspended over a sheer drop, \u201cthat you don\u2019t want to stay?\u201d</p><p>I have to get out of here before I surrender to something I\u2019m not ready for. I can\u2019t think straight, and with what he\u2019s doing, stopping him, let alone myself, isn\u2019t going to get any easier.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Reid.\u201d My God, I couldn\u2019t sound less convincing.</p><p>\u201cMmm, I think you can,\u201d he says, his hands moving over the bare skin of my shoulders, pushing the straps aside. As he presses me gently back on the sofa, looking down at me with a subtle, perceptive smile, I know he can read my longing to give in. And then he\u2019s kissing me again and it\u2019s a full five minutes before we come up for air.</p><p>\u201cReid, please. Not... yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d he says, taking a deep breath, eyes closed. He opens them and smiles wryly. \u201cCan\u2019t blame a guy for trying.\u201d He kisses me one more time, quick and sweet, hands surrounding my face. \u201cYou know where I am if you change your mind, Emma.\u201d</p><p>I leave his room, my legs shaking as though I\u2019ve been at sea for a month, and I feel a weird mixture of regret and relief. It takes me four tries to get the key card to unlock my door.</p><p>I lie back on my bed and push my mental replay button... until my phone beeps, startling me. It\u2019s Meredith, probably wondering what happened when Reid and I disappeared.</p><p>Meredith: You okay? Not that I\u2019m checking up on you or anything. ;)</p><p>Me: Yep. Reid and I decided to stop by the cafe downstairs for a few minutes.</p><p>Meredith: Wanna get lunch and go shopping tomorrow?</p><p>Me: Sounds good. Noon?</p><p>Meredith: Sure. I\u2019ll come to your room, cya then</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>REID</p><p>Time for a re-eval.</p><p>First up, I\u2019m certain Emma\u2019s a virgin. The way she\u2019s holding back isn\u2019t just wariness of me\u2014though that\u2019s part and parcel. She\u2019s new to the whole rodeo. Though there\u2019s nothing about her that says I\u2019m saving myself for marriage or any such crap, most girls want to save themselves for something\u2014usually love, in which, as I\u2019ve already established, I don\u2019t believe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Given the above, her kissing skill is incredible. I know it\u2019s subjective, and not everyone likes the same things, the same way. Honestly, if I\u2019m going to get laid, I tolerate just about anything. But Emma requires no toleration, and with a lot of past history to use for comparison, I know better than to take that for granted. She\u2019s responsive, following every move I make like she did on the dance floor, tentative and sweet while managing to drive me crazy with wanting her, no matter how much control I seem to have over myself and the situation in the beginning.</p><p>It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been this infatuated with someone. Jesus, what a rush. I can\u2019t screw this up, and the best way to insure success in that is to cut off any other action for the duration. After the hour or so the two of us spent in my room last night, I\u2019ve lost all interest in everyone else anyway. I want her. Period.</p><p>So then, Graham Douglas.</p><p>I don\u2019t know him. He\u2019s a puzzle. He\u2019s done nothing but indie films, with some student films mixed in. No acting jobs before he was seventeen, and it looks like he started college before that. No idea if he continued or gave it up or what. He\u2019s two years older than me, a year older than Brooke. I assume the two of them met on some previous project. They seem too chummy to have just met.</p> <p>I can\u2019t find that he crossed paths with Emma before School Pride, but anything is possible. Maybe they hooked up at some point, but not all the way. All the same, he doesn\u2019t seem like the sort to dispute boundaries\u2014if he thinks she\u2019s mine, I think he\u2019ll retreat. After I kissed Emma in front of him yesterday, he backed off without a word. Caveman tactics aren\u2019t in my repertoire, generally, but neither is losing a girl I want this badly.</p><p>Emma</p><p>Over lunch, Meredith grills me. \u201cEmma, what is going on between you and Reid?\u201d</p><p>I shrug one shoulder. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. I thought I might not to get an answer to my text until this morning....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I answered last night\u2014from my room.\u201d She arches a brow. \u201cWhere I was alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, enough interrogation, I get it.\u201d She takes a sip of her iced tea. \u201cI\u2019m still depressed over breaking up with Robby, even if it was for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth twists. \u201cWhen we\u2019re together, everything is fine. When I\u2019m away on location or whatever, it goes to hell. He loses all trust in me. If he can\u2019t get me on my cell, he leaves angry messages. He accuses me of doing things I\u2019d never do. Then he says he loves me and he\u2019s just scared. The night we broke up, I told him I can\u2019t be with him if he can\u2019t trust me. And he said, \u2018Then I guess you can\u2019t be with me,\u2019 and that was that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. That sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously.\u201d</p> <p>My phone beeps and I dig it out of my bag.</p><p>Reid: Dinner tonight? Alone? Be at your room at 7?</p><p>Me: Sure</p><p>\u201cReid?\u201d Meredith asks.</p><p>\u201cHe wants us to go to dinner alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you\u2019re \u2018not sure\u2019 what\u2019s going on.\u201d She smirks. \u201cLook, he obviously likes you, you like him... unless there\u2019s someone else?\u201d</p><p>I think of Graham, and my teeth clench. Why can\u2019t I stop thinking of him that way? Because of one kiss that he obviously thinks was a mistake? I stack my fork and knife on the plate, not looking at her. \u201cNo. I just need to get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear that. Robby and I have broken up three times in the last two years, and I really just need to get over it.\u201d Her eyes well up with tears. I wish I could find this Robby guy and dead-leg him, like I\u2019d done to a kid who broke Emily\u2019s heart in second grade, when retribution was easy.</p> <p>\u201cSo. What are we wearing tonight? Casual hot, or dressy hot?\u201d Meredith asks, smiling, blinking her tears away. \u201cWe\u2019re about to shop this town\u2019s rocks off. We need to know what we\u2019re hunting for.\u201d</p><p>Me: Casual or dressy?</p><p>Reid: Preference?</p><p>Me: No?</p><p>Reid: K, lol. Casual it is. See you at 7.</p><p>While I\u2019m dressing for my date with Reid (dark jeans, purple silk tank), I think about my run with Graham this morning. He didn\u2019t ask what happened to me last night, thank God. He asked about my upcoming classes. Those of us who haven\u2019t graduated and are under eighteen are required by law to attend class on set during the school year. Next week, Jenna, Meredith and I begin timed blocks of instruction with tutors. I\u2019ll have enough credits to graduate by November.</p><p>\u201cSo then what?\u201d We single-filed around a slower couple, for the third time in ten minutes. \u201cCollege?\u201d The paths are busy on Sunday mornings, which makes carrying on a conversation a disconnected and sporadic event.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never planned to go.\u201d</p><p>He smiled down at a toddler in a stroller as we passed, and she smiled back. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve never considered it a requirement. Or an option.\u201d I felt myself getting defensive. \u201cI\u2019m not that bright. I do okay in my coursework, but nothing spectacular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re underestimating yourself, Emma. And most people in college are not geniuses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve taken some sort of poll? Or perhaps did some research?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, falling in behind me as we passed a group jogging the opposite direction. \u201cIf research can be defined as being aware that you could run brainy little circles around most of the people I\u2019ve gone to class with,\u201d he said, \u201cthen yes.\u201d</p><p>The warm sensation that flowed through me was both similar to yet nothing like some guy telling me I\u2019m hot. Some guy like Reid, for instance.</p><p>\u201cMiShaun says you completed a degree in New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite. My final semester is this spring, after School Pride wraps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get so far ahead?\u201d</p><p>He bit his lip. \u201cWith academic parents and older sisters, I was precocious. I skipped kindergarten, moved from second grade to third mid-year. I liked being younger than anyone else in class, even though I got beat up occasionally for being pretentious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you pretentious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI was completely full of myself, pretty much all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you finished high school when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixteen.\u201d He smirked at me. \u201cClever diversion, getting me to talk about myself so I\u2019ll quit asking you about your future plans, which you haven\u2019t made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to divert. I was curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d I guessed he was wearing the same expression that got him creamed on the playground.</p><p>\u201cBesides, if you\u2019re trying to convince me that people who go to college aren\u2019t brilliant, you totally suck at the persuasive part of your argument.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not brilliant. I\u2019ve just always been a bit more... driven... than my peers. Another thing\u2014certain classes and instructors make you think and generate approaches to issues you didn\u2019t know existed. As an actor, it gives you more depth to pull from.\u201d</p><p>Almost exactly what Jenna said on the plane.</p><p>\u201cHu\u2014\u201d I caught myself and clamped my lips shut.</p><p>\u201cNice catch,\u201d he said before taking the lead so we could pass another slowpoke walker.</p><p>I\u2019m ready to go at 6:45. By 7:00, I\u2019ve retouched my hair four times, checked my teeth twice, sat down on the bed and stood up again countless times. At the knock, my stomach drops. Without checking the peephole, I pull the door open, and there stands Brooke, dressed to go out, but her hair is straight on one side, wavy on the other.</p><p>\u201cBrooke? Hi?\u201d</p><p>She walks into my room. \u201cHey, cute tank. Please tell me you have a Chi flatiron. Mine shorted out or something. Goddamned thing made a zzzzt noise when I was halfway done, as you can undoubtedly see with your own eyes, and now I have a date in like twenty minutes with the super hot manager of that band we saw the other night? And my hair looks like complete crap.\u201d</p><p>Band manager? She has a date with a band manager? \u201cUh, sure. I\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank God. I seriously wanted to kill someone but couldn\u2019t think who\u2019d be culpable except for whoever put that thing together, and they\u2019re probably making three cents an hour and working out of a windowless factory in southeast Asia.\u201d</p><p>As we exit the bathroom, a confident knock sounds at the door. Brooke\u2019s eyes slide to me. \u201cDate tonight, Emma? Who is it? Reid?\u201d She peers through the peephole. \u201cYep, there he stands, Mr. Everything.\u201d I\u2019m wondering what she means by that as she pulls the door open and stands in the doorway. \u201cHey there.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s wearing jeans and a white jersey Lacoste shirt, and he looks like he got up from a nap, ran a hand through his hair and pronounced it fine. And that\u2019s the thing\u2014it is fine. This is the most unfair and strangely subtle characteristic that he possesses: the more blas\u00e9 he is about his appearance, the more beautiful he gets.</p><p>Over Brooke\u2019s shoulder, I watch a number of emotions flicker over Reid\u2019s face. Glancing at the number on the door and back to her, he blinks, his head tilting sideways just slightly. His eyes narrow, spotting me behind her. \u201cBrooke. Nice hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. I\u2019m off to repair my split personality. You children have fun.\u201d She turns to me. \u201cThanks for the Chi. I owe you big time.\u201d She and Reid are like five-year-olds in a stare-off as she walks around him, until she breaks it off and walks towards her room, humming.</p><p>\u201cOdd girl,\u201d he says, turning back to me. His gaze appreciative, he looks me up and down. Taking my hand, he twirls me around slowly. \u201cYou look so hot. Are you ready to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I\u2019ll get my bag.\u201d I take a calming breath as I cross the room, trying to remind myself that he\u2019s just a guy. On this date, he\u2019s just a guy.</p><p>Right.</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>REID</p><p>Bob and Jeff are standing at the hotel exit, which tells me everything is about to get a lot more interesting. When we step outside and the flashes start, Emma\u2019s hand tightens in mine. With our bodyguards running defense, I slide an arm around Emma and lead her to the waiting car. She\u2019s clearly a little freaked out and unused to this level of media attention.</p><p>One of the many alarming and unexpected things no one tells you is how close the people with cameras come. Don\u2019t they have professional zoom lenses? Do they really need to duck under Bob\u2019s meaty arm to snap a flash right in our faces? The photographers call my name, trying to get me to glance up so they can get the money shot. When that doesn\u2019t work, they try Emma. She follows my lead and ignores them. Smart girl.</p><p>Some of the paparazzi follow us to the restaurant, which is at least half an hour away, and the flashes start up again before we even get out of the car. Bob and Jeff, as usual, are worth every penny production is paying them, supplying a wall of muscle on either side of us as we dash inside.</p><p>We\u2019re greeted by a deferential ma\u00eetre d, dim lighting, thick carpeting, limestone walls and wood beams. The wait staff is dressed in formal black and white, tables boast crisp white cloths and frosted candlelight, and tiny white lights wrap around columns and dip overhead like stars. I give my name and we\u2019re ushered to a table near the window in the back, as I requested, with a view of the lake. There\u2019s outdoor seating and a dock, which is trimmed with more firefly-sized lights. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I watch her face as she takes it all in. \u201cLike it?\u201d</p><p>Her wide grey-green eyes drift over everything, returning to mine. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d I\u2019m staring at her. Haven\u2019t stopped since we sat down. She smiles shyly into her lap. The table is small, and I lean forward and take her hand, the ghost of a smile playing across my mouth, and bring it to my lips, kissing the knuckles one at a time. Corny, I know. Just the sort of thing guys are usually too dense to actually do. Her cheeks glow a little pink.</p><p>\u201cSo Emma. Are you ready to be famous?\u201d I release her hand, leaning back as the waiter arrives with a bottle of wine. \u201cBecause this film is going to do it for both of us.\u201d</p> <p>She smirks at me while the wine is tasted and approved, doesn\u2019t speak until the waiter disappears. \u201cYou\u2019re already famous.\u201d</p><p>I frown, lips pursed. \u201cI am? What makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know... the photographers who follow you around, maybe? The girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat girls? I haven\u2019t noticed any girls,\u201d I say, and she laughs again. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve noticed one girl. And I haven\u2019t been able to see or care about any of the others lately. They might as well be invisible.\u201d</p><p>Peering at me, head angled, she says, \u201cHmm.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to say too much too soon. She seems oddly perceptive where bullshit is concerned. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer. Are you ready for it yourself?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s still a little surreal. I want to be successful, of course. But part of me just wants to be a normal girl.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s a new one. Who wants to be normal? \u201cNormal how?\u201d</p><p>The self-consciousness is back. She bites her lip, fingers tracing the base of her wine glass as she debates what to reveal. \u201cLike... high school. Theatre class. Homecoming football games. College plans. Prom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProm, eh?\u201d I laugh softly and she smiles. \u201cHow long have you been tutored?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince sixth grade.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI started then, too.\u201d</p><p>She leans up. \u201cIt never bothered you\u2014the friends you left behind? The athletic teams you never played on, the class president spot you\u2019d have easily won?\u201d</p><p>No one\u2019s ever asked me about this before. I never gave much thought to what I may have left behind or given up. I finished my degree credits a year ago, and was more than happy to be done with classes, assignments and tutors. \u201cI never did public school, so my situation was never all that normal to begin with.\u201d I lean closer, too, elbows on the table. \u201cYou realize, don\u2019t you, that there are millions of kids our age who\u2019d desert all of that stuff in a heartbeat to have what we have, to be who we are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I hear.\u201d She colors slightly and I smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, and she blushes harder, smiling into her lap again.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Just some stuff my best friend said to me recently. About doing this movie.\u201d I tilt my head, an acknowledgement that there\u2019s more she isn\u2019t saying. She rolls her eyes. \u201cWith you.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but chuckle. \u201cSo I have a loyal fan in\u2014where do you live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSacramento.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSacramento. Not too far from LA.\u201d I know what I\u2019m implying the moment this is out of my mouth.</p><p>She does, too, and she\u2019s studying my face. \u201cIt\u2019s like 400 miles. Not exactly next door.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cNo. But not as far as say, Texas, or New York.\u201d I know what I\u2019m implying with this, too, but I\u2019ve got the innocent look down. Growing up with my dad taught me to either lie like a pro or not bother.</p><p>In a feat of perfect timing that will earn him a thirty percent tip, the waiter arrives with our meals.</p><p>Emma</p><p>Strangely, I haven\u2019t given much thought to where Graham lives, in relation to me. But New York is on the other side of the country from Sacramento. In comparison, Los Angeles seems right down the street. I should pinch myself right now for thinking about Graham at all. I\u2019m on a date with Reid. And I\u2019m enjoying it.</p><p>The meal is amazing, the waiter attentive but not intrusive. We talk about jobs we\u2019ve done, people we\u2019ve worked with or want to work with, and he\u2019s funny, especially when discussing Hollywood gossip, and how petty and catty people can be. How fake. Which makes me think of Brooke.</p><p>\u201cSo how do you know Brooke?\u201d I ask, not thinking this question will get the reaction it does. I just recalled the animosity that seems to be between them and wondered at the reason. He reigns in his response quickly, but not before I see what flies across his face. Even still, I\u2019m not sure how to interpret it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014I\u2019m not trying to pry... I just... noticed you guys seem... uh...\u201d Oh my God, I\u2019ve talked myself into a corner.</p><p>\u201cNoticed that, did you?\u201d His voice is careful, calm. He doesn\u2019t seem angry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2014it\u2019s none of my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve never really... discussed what happened with anyone.\u201d He shifts in his chair, waits while the waiter takes his plate. \u201cWe were involved. A long time ago.\u201d His blue eyes sweep up and he sighs. \u201cTo say it didn\u2019t end well would be an understatement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. I\u2019m really... sorry.\u201d I\u2019m dying to know what happened, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019m asking that of him.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, it was a long time ago. I\u2019m way over it, believe me. I know she is, too. This is just the first time we\u2019ve worked together since then.\u201d He smiles pensively, then twitches his hair back and seems to shake off any negative leftovers. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for either of us to be bitter at this point. She seems happy enough with Graham.\u201d</p><p>Boom. Just like that.</p><p>\u201cAre they\u2014? I mean, tonight she said...\u201d Oops, this is probably going against the girl code. Even if Brooke and I aren\u2019t exactly best friends.</p><p>He arches a brow. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Ugh! What if he tells Graham? Should I tell Graham?</p><p>\u201cWell, um, she said something about a date tonight...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith someone other than Graham, is that what you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I feel uncomfortable having divulged this, until Reid answers.</p><p>\u201cEmma... you\u2019re not used to Hollywood people. You\u2019re still inexperienced\u2014not that you should be anything else.\u201d He snaps a credit card on top of the bill and sends the waiter away. \u201cI\u2019m almost positive Brooke and Graham, living as far apart as they do, have an understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean... to go out with other people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither that, or they\u2019re just fooling around while we\u2019re on location here.\u201d I guess the look on my face takes me directly from inexperienced to downright na\u00efve, because he says, \u201cOh great. I\u2019ve shocked you. Look, I\u2019m sure whatever they\u2019re doing, they\u2019ve agreed on between them. The best thing to do in this business is adopt a live-and-let-live attitude.\u201d</p><p>He signs the receipt, an illegible scrawl, and stands, taking my hand. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>When we reach the hotel, he shields me on the way in as he did hours ago, on the way out. Once we\u2019re inside, he takes my hand as we cross the lobby. I feel more comfortable with him than I ever thought it possible to be, but my pulse is hammering by the time we get into the elevator. When the doors shut, he leans against the side wall and pulls me forward, his feet spread just far enough apart for me to stand in between them. \u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you now,\u201d he says, his hands pressing my low back. And then he does.</p><p>We stop at my door, and he says nothing about us continuing to his room. \u201cI know you have filming at an offensive hour tomorrow, so if you\u2019ll let me have one more kiss just inside your door, I\u2019ll go to my room, where I\u2019ll sit and smile for a bit before falling asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo killing zombies tonight?\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cAh, who was it\u2014Tadd, or Quinton? That addiction is supposed to be our secret. It\u2019s like Fight Club for guys with faces that have to stay pretty.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, unlocking my door. We step inside my room, where I\u2019ve left a single lamp on and curtains open, because it was light outside when we left. Reid lets the door shut and immediately presses me to it, his hands on my shoulders. Inverting his hands, his fingernails lightly skim down my bare arms. When he gets to my hands, he takes them in his, dips his head and kisses me.</p><p>\u201cI have to go now or I\u2019m not going at all,\u201d he says, minutes later. I can\u2019t do any more than nod. He kisses me again, pulling away and murmuring, \u201cDamn,\u201d before opening the door and slipping into the hallway.</p><p>Production interrupted the Bennet house filming schedule in favor of completing some scenes at the mall. We have to be on location and ready to go by 5 a.m. so we can wrap filming before the mall opens. No one can blame us for whining about morning coming too soon when we\u2019re dragging ourselves out of bed at 4 a.m.\u2014which I\u2019m sorry is not technically morning. Graham and I decided yesterday, when we got news of the change, to sacrifice our morning runs for the week.</p><p>Five of us stumble into the limo and collapse on the seats, clutching Starbucks cups and battered sides, going over lines. Reid, Tadd and Brooke don\u2019t film until the afternoon, so at the moment, everyone hates them. Quinton sprawls next to me, eyes shut and Ray-Bans in place, despite the darkness outside and the tinted windows, as if the mini-lights throughout the interior of the limo are an outrage. \u201cWhy am I awake? Sun\u2019s not even up yet,\u201d he complains.</p><p>Next to me, Graham\u2019s mouth turns up on one side and he bumps my foot with his. We\u2019re used to being up before the sun, familiar with the gradual warmth on our backs as it rises, the erratic, elongated shadows it creates ahead of us as we jog west along the river paths, its rays on our faces as we circle around to head back to the hotel. \u201cI miss running already,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI hear mall walking is popular with the older folks,\u201d I say. \u201cYou could stick around after we\u2019re done filming, get a few laps in...\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, fighting to repress a grin. \u201cFunny girl.\u201d His gaze moves to the window across from us, and we both watch the cityscape passing by for several moments. \u201cWhat if the running isn\u2019t the only part of it I miss?\u201d</p><p>I glance at him, but his gaze doesn\u2019t shift from the window. God.</p><p>Em: Details from last night?? I saw photos online, but it isn\u2019t the same as the straight dirt.</p><p>Me: It was nice. We talked a lot. The paparazzi stuff is all a little scary.</p><p>Em: You\u2019re going out with a guy who has his own posters, i mean holy shit.</p><p>Me: I knnnnooooowww. It didn\u2019t feel like that last night though...</p><p>Em: Are you guys official? Fan pages say your people and his people are not commenting.</p><p>Me: I have people??</p><p>Em: Apparently</p><p>Me: Ugh. Gotta go film. I\u2019m supposed to start classes this afternoon. Zzzzzz</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>REID </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For the past three days, any time I can get away with it, I\u2019m monopolizing Emma\u2019s time. Her afternoon classes are an annoying interruption, plus now she has assignments to do during the free time that I\u2019d rather she spend with me. We have next Monday off, due in part to it being Labor Day and in part to Adam Richter\u2019s wife having a scheduled C-section that day.</p><p>For me, a long weekend means two things. First, Emma\u2019s going home to Sacramento on Saturday, so I already won\u2019t see her for three days. And second, my mom\u2019s first two weeks in rehab, which I\u2019ve consciously refused to think about, are almost up. Dad\u2019s just informed me that I\u2019m leaving for LA Friday night\u2014meaning tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re expected to be at a family session with her Saturday morning,\u201d he says.</p><p>I feel myself responding emotionally to his dictatorial bearing before I even process the words. And then I process the words. Family. Session. The last thing I want is to talk to another fucking therapist because of Mom. \u201cWhat,\u201d I say, my voice devoid of inflection.</p> <p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry if this interrupts your routine partying, but this is your mother, and she should be important enough to give up an hour or so of your customary time-squandering activities. George has you set up for Austin to LA Friday night, and I\u2019m driving us out to Malibu Saturday morning.\u201d</p><p>Okay so first, he thinks he\u2019s going to lecture me on making Mom a priority? What about all the dinners he misses? The charity shit she does that he pays no goddamned attention to? He spends evenings and weekends in do-not-disturb-I\u2019m-important-and-working mode, even when he\u2019s home. Now, because she\u2019s in rehab again, he\u2019s going to play the concern card? Really?</p><p>I run a hand through my hair, grabbing and pulling it while my jaw clenches. He pushes every goddamned button I have. \u201cFine. Friday night. Tell George to have a car waiting at LAX.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already set up\u2014you know George.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say again. I\u2019m done talking to him but for some inane reason can\u2019t seem to just hang the fuck up on him.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be in a little late for dinner\u2014\u201d he begins.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks anyway, Dad. This week is killing me. Just have Immaculada leave me something I can heat up when I get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. tomorrow.\u201d I push end, hurl my phone at the bed. It bounces once and off, hitting the thick carpeting. \u201cGoddammit.\u201d</p><p>Emma is in tutoring for another few minutes. She\u2019s coming to my room when she\u2019s done. The past few days, we\u2019ve been dancing around the subject of sex. Any time I take a step up and she responds by stepping back, so do I. But I really don\u2019t want to go home without this in the bag. If home and Dad and family sessions weren\u2019t looming, I could keep hold of my patience better. If I hadn\u2019t decided to terminate local hookups, I could just grab Quinton or Tadd and go out, find someone... if, if, if. Gah. I keep telling myself that she\u2019ll be worth the wait. If the chemistry we have so far is any indication, she\u2019ll be more than worth it.</p><p>Most of us were in the Gap this morning, where she and I did scenes in which our characters were involved in a heated exchange. I swear we were both so into it we were half pissed, half turned on by the time Richter called cut. While waiting for production to get the lighting repositioned, I angled my head away from the crush of people all standing around. \u201cCome \u2019ere.\u201d</p> <p>She followed me, puzzled, as I walked to the opposite side of a ten-foot high partition hung with board shorts on one side and sundresses on the other. \u201cReid? What\u2014?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t let her finish, drawing her into the rainbow of sundresses and kissing her, pushing her up against the makeshift wall, the gauzy cotton at her back like a cushion. When I lifted my head, she blinked, her hands braced on my chest, not exactly pulling me forward, not exactly pushing me away, either. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d She was a little breathless.</p><p>\u201cThat was \u2018Have dinner with me tonight.\u2019\u201d I started to lean in again and she put a hand over my mouth, laughing quietly and glancing over my shoulder to make sure no one had discovered us. I guess someone had to care about that, because I sure as shit didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWe have to be here early again tomorrow. We won\u2019t really have time to go out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner in, then.\u201d Her hand muffled my words, and the careful one-day scruff of beard I have to keep for filming tickled her palm.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to behave?\u201d She began to slide her hand away, carefully, like she didn\u2019t trust me. I tried not to smile and failed. When she arched a brow at me with a look of authority, I imagined her with a ruler in one hand and a piece of chalk in the other, wearing glasses, a tight little skirt, high heeled pumps... definitely not helping.</p><p>I nodded, holding up two fingers. \u201cScout\u2019s honor.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. \u201cSomehow I can\u2019t imagine you as a Boy Scout.\u201d</p> <p>I blinked innocently. \u201cOh\u2014that\u2019s a Boy Scout thing?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes and I leaned in and kissed her. \u201cReid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma... my room or yours? Your choice.\u201d I grazed her temple with my lips and lowered my voice to a whisper. \u201cLots of this.\u201d I kissed her again. \u201cAnd all clothes stay on.\u201d</p><p>She peered at me, lips pursed, and I held up two fingers again, which made her laugh and shove my shoulder. \u201cOkay. Yours.\u201d</p><p>Just then we heard the PA, Laura, coming around the corner saying, \u201cThey couldn\u2019t have gone far...\u201d I stepped two feet back, yanking my sides from the back pocket of my jeans while pulling Emma from the vertical mattress I\u2019d pressed her into.</p><p>When Laura appeared, I was pointing to the middle of the sheet and Emma was looking on. \u201cAnd that\u2019s your cue to give me the evil eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! I see,\u201d Emma said, as though we were discussing the script while standing amongst a buttload of sundresses. Out of sight from everyone else. Good thing we\u2019re actors.</p><p>Laura spotted us. \u201cThere you are. What are you two doing over here? Nobody knew where you went! They\u2019re ready for you.\u201d Emma gave me another little shove when Laura looked away. I mouthed what? with the most angelic expression I could muster.</p><p>Mall filming should wrap early tomorrow. A couple of retakes, a few distance and tracking shots, and we\u2019re out. Even still, I\u2019ve got to pack and get to LAX to check in by five. So it\u2019s tonight, or we\u2019re talking next week. Damn.</p><p>Emma</p><p>The big screen television is still on, but we\u2019re not exactly paying attention to it.</p><p>When I got to his room, he pulled me inside and locked every bolt on the door. \u201cUm...\u201d I said, and he told me he didn\u2019t want housecleaning coming in, but he thought I probably wouldn\u2019t want him to hang the do not disturb tag on the door. Definitely not.</p><p>Now, we\u2019re sitting on the floor, our backs to the foot of the bed, and he\u2019s just told me that if the zombie apocalypse ever happens, I\u2019m going to be in deep shit. I pretend to be insulted. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced that my inability to avoid getting my brains eaten on a video game directly correlates to certain death in an actual zombie attack.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, he tosses the controllers next to the television and pulls me up from the floor. \u201cMaybe not. But you have to admit, it doesn\u2019t bode well.\u201d We pick our way through the dinner dishes littering the blanket he\u2019d spread on the floor when room service arrived. Very little remains of his butter poached jumbo shrimp or my artichoke cream cheese crepes; nothing remains of the chardonnay. I feel just full enough and pleasantly fuzzy, but not drunk. As we sit on the sofa, though, I\u2019m so aware of him, of every detail, that I\u2019m buzzing hard.</p><p>\u201cSo. Where were we earlier today, while we were hiding from the film crew...\u201d</p><p>His hands run over me, so focused and expert that the existence of clothing makes little difference. We make out on his sofa, kissing and touching until I\u2019m lying flat, melting into the cushions as he stares down, his eyes navy blue in the dim light, his tousled hair hanging over his forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re incredible,\u201d he says, his voice soft, face propped on one hand while the other carefully teases from the hollow in my throat, over a breast, triggering a gasp when his fingers graze the nipple, down over my stomach, dipping into my shorts.</p><p>He makes no move to unfasten them, but I know what he\u2019s thinking. He knows that I do. He\u2019s a hypnotist, and he doesn\u2019t intend to snap his fingers and count to three, removing me from this trance. \u201cI know what I promised. Clothing on. But you promised nothing, and if you want to, I\u2019d be happy to let you make me a liar.\u201d</p><p>The difference between us? He knows exactly what he wants.</p><p>\u201cReid. It\u2019s only been a week.\u201d Five days, actually. Five days of kissing and making out, half our encounters ending in some sort of skirmish of yes and no.</p><p>\u201cThat long?\u201d I roll my eyes and he laughs. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Emma. I know I\u2019m being pushy. You\u2019re so adorably irresistible, and I\u2019m just a guy, you know?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s overly fond of that excuse. As though I wouldn\u2019t pull him into his bed right now, if not for that nagging feeling that I need a few more days. If he\u2019s this persistent with every girl he runs across, the majority would have been in his bed five days ago if they were in my position. And that\u2019s what\u2019s bothering me. How many have there been, and how many are waiting in the wings? I need some time alone, to think. And I need Emily.</p><p>Reid Alexander wants to sleep with me. And I keep telling him no.</p><p>I must be insane.</p><p>No one checked out of the hotel in Austin, preferring to keep our temporary quarters intact, so I\u2019ve only brought one bag with me on this trip to the home that\u2019s never felt like home.</p><p>When my father married Chloe, she moved into our house. Within months, she began pleading for a new place. \u201cWe need a home of our own,\u201d she pouted, her arms around his neck as I eavesdropped from the laundry nook off of the hallway to their bedroom. \u201cLet\u2019s move to Los Angeles or San Francisco. Somewhere not so horrible and suburban.\u201d I held my breath. Leaving Sacramento would mean leaving Emily and Grandma.</p><p>\u201cChloe, my job is here,\u201d he answered.</p><p>The compromise was a big new house, where the furniture was child-unfriendly and my bedroom was decorated in something Chloe called shabby chic, the walls a mustard-gone-bad color that I hadn\u2019t known existed. I spent weekends with my grandmother as often as possible, where it was acceptable to talk about Mom, and I was permitted to put my feet on the sofa and keep a kitten I named Hector.</p><p>One weekend, after Chloe had taken it upon herself to sit me down and deliver the Sex Talk, I stammered through asking Grandma some follow-up questions. I wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d know the answers, but I figured she\u2019d had my mom, so she must have had sex at least once in her life. When I repeated some of Chloe\u2019s basic explanations, my grandmother\u2019s usually-composed face turned a mottled purple, and I was afraid I\u2019d just given her a heart attack. But she just took a deep breath and said, \u201cThis discussion calls for some cocoa, with plenty of tiny marshmallows.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I was fourteen, Grandma died of a brain aneurysm. She\u2019d been diligent about good diet and exercise, cancer checks and heart disease prevention. I researched and found out that they\u2019re virtually undetectable, especially if there are no symptoms like headaches or double vision. And even if they\u2019d found it earlier, they might not have been able to do anything about it, nestled in her brain. She would have hated knowing there was a ticking time bomb in her head.</p><p>I begged my father and Chloe to allow Hector to come live with us. I swore to vacuum and use pet rollers every single day, promised to feed, water and scoop litter. All Chloe said was, \u201cI\u2019m allergic, Connor!\u201d I\u2019m convinced that the only thing about Hector that Chloe was allergic to was the thought of his fur attaching itself to her garish clothes and furniture.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Emma,\u201d my father said as I stomped to my room. \u201cWe\u2019ll find him a new home.\u201d He sounded remorseful, but unwavering. In a conflict, Chloe\u2019s desires always overrode mine.</p><p>Emily, livid in my defense, pleaded with her mother to take in my orphaned cat. Mrs. Watson wasn\u2019t thrilled about Hector\u2019s beautiful long white hair, but to our shock, she consented. Hector, no dummy, transferred his feline displays of adoration\u2014infrequent lap sitting and frequent tail hugs\u2014to Emily\u2019s mom. My cat is ten now, a senior citizen in feline years.</p> <p>\u201cOnly one bag?\u201d My father eyes my duffel dubiously when I exit the airport. He\u2019s used to Chloe, with whom there\u2019s no such thing as skipping the baggage carousel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only here for a couple days.\u201d I toss it into the backseat and climb into his SUV.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the filming going?\u201d he asks, pulling into traffic as I take a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I\u2019m trying to focus on seeing Emily, and her mother, and Hector. If they hadn\u2019t been waiting for me in Sacramento, I\u2019d have rather stayed in Austin for the weekend, even if I was completely alone there. I wouldn\u2019t have come home to see Chloe, not in a million years. I wouldn\u2019t have come home to see my father.</p><p>Opposing viewpoints war inside my mind. On one hand, I want to ask his advice about Reid and Graham, and college, and the fact that I\u2019m going to be a legal adult soon. I want him to know that it scares the hell out of me because I have no plans for my life besides continuing what I\u2019ve always done.</p> <p>On the other hand, I don\u2019t want to speak to him at all.</p><p>Every developmental psychology website I\u2019ve searched says that the desire to separate is natural in adolescents. But what I\u2019m feeling can\u2019t be natural, and the freedom I have wasn\u2019t gained normally. I grew up with no religious commandments, not much of a curfew, and no pressure to succeed academically. Grandma and Mrs. Watson loved me, but they couldn\u2019t parent me. That authority was always with my father, and all he\u2019s ever exerted it to do is urge me to become a star. I\u2019m a seventeen-year-old who\u2019s raised herself for a solid freaking decade. I\u2019ve done a pretty good job of it, but that fact is so incredibly sad that it\u2019s infuriating. Sitting here in the front seat of my father\u2019s car, I realize that I am furious.</p><p>In an effort to fill the silence, he begins to talk about work, and the kitchen redesign Chloe initiated, and a problem with the sprinkler system that required the entire yard to be dug up and a new system to be installed.</p><p>I don\u2019t respond.</p><p>And he doesn\u2019t notice that I don\u2019t.</p><p>Chapter 29</p> <p>REID</p><p>We\u2019re halfway to the rehab facility, and neither of us has said a word. Once we leave LA proper, the haze that domes the city almost 365 days a year abates. A bright blue sky seems painted above the landscape; the only clouds are wisps of smoke in the distance.</p><p>I have no idea what to expect from the therapy session, or from Mom. I have no faith in the process. Why should I? The process has failed her multiple times. She struggles to stay sober while I struggle to avoid it.</p><p>That\u2019s not exactly true. While it\u2019s true that I push my boundaries as often as possible, I have it under control when it needs to be. I like getting hammered sometimes, sure. I\u2019m young. It\u2019s fun. Why not? I\u2019m not using alcohol to \u201cnumb the pain\u201d or any stupid shit like that. I\u2019m not using it when I\u2019m working. Any number of Mom\u2019s therapists would say I\u2019m in denial. That I\u2019m making excuses. I\u2019d say I\u2019m explaining. They\u2019d say there\u2019s a difference between explanations and excuses, and I\u2019m doing one and calling it the other. Then I\u2019d say I don\u2019t fucking care which it is, I\u2019m fine. And that\u2019s the end of that.</p><p>John\u2019s texting me\u2014says there\u2019s a party tonight we\u2019ve got to make it to. He wants to know if I want to stay over at his apartment near campus. He starts classes Tuesday, not that he\u2019s stressed about it. I doubt he\u2019s even got an idea what his schedule is\u2014his father required him to apply as a finance major. I can\u2019t imagine how that\u2019s going to end, but it\u2019ll be explosive. John is riding the ragged edge of pretending to follow in his dad\u2019s footsteps. I\u2019m glad that at least I don\u2019t have to do that. I\u2019ve got my own path, and while Dad may not get it, he seems to support it. At the very least, he\u2019s never tried to mold me into a younger version of himself: Mark Alexander, fucking brilliant attorney at law. Bonus\u2014beautiful, alcoholic wife and talented, irresponsible son.</p><p>I doubt he thinks I\u2019d even be capable of turning out like him, not that I can argue the point, and not that I ever wanted to be.</p><p>When we arrive, Dad charges straight across the lobby to the reception desk and I trail him, not taking my sunglasses off until I get past the reception area and anyone hanging out there. The woman behind the desk recognizes him and immediately looks at me, blinking rapidly even though her expression remains neutral, confirming that she knows who I am by association. I wonder if my fame makes being here more difficult for Mom, where everyone knows, or will know\u2014that she\u2019s the mother of Reid Alexander. She can\u2019t be anonymous, any more than I can. But at least my notoriety was/is my choice.</p><p>The place is posh, no surprise, and Mom seems as fragile as always, also no surprise. We are only allowed to meet with her in the counselor\u2019s office for this visit, and frankly I\u2019m hoping this time will be the only one required of me.</p> <p>There are two sofas\u2014one of them is more like a loveseat\u2014and two chairs, surrounding a low table. The therapist, Dr. Weems, takes one of the chairs, crossing her legs and opening the file on her lap, giving us no direction on where to sit. I sense a test, but I\u2019m not sure what arrangement she\u2019d accept as positive, or if she perceives that I know she\u2019s analyzing each of us and how we relate to each other based on our choice. By the time these thoughts make their way through my brain, Dad is sitting in the middle of the long sofa, mom next to him in the corner. I plop down in the middle of the loveseat because that choice doesn\u2019t require anything but sitting straight down. Dr. Weems is scribbling, already finding my faults, or maybe she\u2019s doodling a cartoon of funny cats while waiting for us to stop playing musical sofas.</p><p>\u201cMark, Reid, I\u2019m Dr. Weems\u2014please call me Marcie. It\u2019s good to meet both of you.\u201d She smiles that calculating therapist smile, the one that doesn\u2019t quite reach the eyes, as Dad greets her politely and leans up to shake her hand. When she turns to look at me, I\u2019m leaning forward, elbows on knees, ready to bolt out of here at the first opportunity. I raise my chin once, acknowledging her. That\u2019s the best I\u2019ll do, and my peripheral awareness of Dad\u2019s glower won\u2019t change it.</p><p>She\u2019s undaunted. I doubt asshole adolescent males are new to her. \u201cWe\u2019ve made some really solid progress in the last two weeks.\u201d The heel of Marcie\u2019s pump is hanging slightly from her foot, as though she\u2019s actually playing dress up and wearing her mother\u2019s shoes. \u201cI\u2019m pleased that the two of you could join us so you could see for yourselves that your loved one is doing well, and so we can do a little work as a family unit.\u201d</p><p>Our \u201cloved one\u201d is sitting right there, being spoken about in the third person with an epithetical term rather than her name. I\u2019ll admit I have issues with therapists in general. I think they\u2019re a pretentious group of people who believe they know your innermost secrets from body language and what they trick you into saying. Marcie is all that plus attributes from your least favorite, most biased teacher ever.</p><p>I watch Mom, the way her fingers shake with the slightest tremor, barely perceptible, whenever she has to speak. When she looks up, I try to catch her eyes\u2014dark blue, identical to mine\u2014wondering if she wants someone to just grab her hand and get the hell out of here. But no, she\u2019s determined to tackle the demons. She clenches her jaw, frowns at the flower arrangement in the center of the table or the stack of magazines on either side. And then she pushes her small voice forward, and answers Marcie\u2019s probing questions and Dad\u2019s careful inquiries.</p><p>Marcie squints at me a few times during the hour. I\u2019m not saying anything unless asked directly, and even then, I\u2019m the opposite of forthcoming. What I don\u2019t say: I don\u2019t want to be here, I don\u2019t want to contribute, and I don\u2019t see why I have to when it isn\u2019t me in rehab. When the hour is up, I feel like I was just released from prison.</p><p>When Mom hugs me goodbye, my arms slide around her and I realize she\u2019s even smaller than usual. \u201cThank you for coming,\u201d she says into my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I love you.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes. Say it, say it, say it. \u201cYou too.\u201d Both not good enough and better than nothing. She gives me another squeeze before letting go. She walks into my dad\u2019s arms and I turn towards the window. He\u2019s the worst kind of hypocrite\u2014pretending this level of give-a-shit now when she\u2019s spent years flying along behind him like a kite, just trying to stay airborne.</p><p>Emma</p><p>\u201cWhere are Reid\u2019s posters?\u201d I\u2019m reclining on Emily\u2019s bed, Hector draped over my abdomen, purring an atypical welcome. I stroke his silky back and scratch behind his ears.</p><p>Emily closes her bedroom door, where two sexy-beautiful close-up posters of Reid are attached with double-stick tape. (Emily\u2019s mom has two rules for posters: double-stick tape, not thumbtacks, and on the doors, never the walls.) \u201cYou downgraded him to the back of the door?\u201d Emily\u2019s system: the favored boys go on the closet door, visible all the time; the lesser ones go to the back of her bedroom door. Quinton\u2019s is still on the closet door, and has in fact moved to the number one spot: face level above the door knob.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem right to have Reid in a prominent spot when you two are practically a couple. I can\u2019t cheat with my best friend\u2019s guy. Even theoretically.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s like a brother to you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be crazy,\u201d she answers. \u201cLook at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do look at him. Practically every day.\u201d</p><p>She mock-glares at me and I laugh.</p><p>\u201cI found a few pics of Graham, by the way.\u201d She plops onto the bed next to me, grabbing a pillow and propping her head at the foot of the bed so we can see each other over the lump of Hector fur. \u201cHe\u2019s hot, though more in that intense, introspective sorta way, rather than Reid\u2019s all-American look. My coworkers would be all over him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I breathe a sigh, trying to clear the stab of hostility I suddenly feel towards Emily\u2019s coworkers. \u201cEm, I don\u2019t understand how you work at Hot Topic, dress twenty-first century Gothic, and are attracted to guys who look like Reid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpposites attract?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot usually,\u201d I say, and she shrugs.</p><p>\u201cSo, the fan pages are speculating that you and Reid are having hot sex all over Austin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? God. Well, we\u2019re not.\u201d I cover my face and Hector meows in complaint until I begin stroking him again. \u201cI still don\u2019t know what kind of relationship he wants. Or, you know, if. He\u2019s used to girls throwing themselves at him. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m confusing the crap out of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He stares at us from the back of her door. \u201cOfficial dilemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously.\u201d Hector rolls over, flopping between us on the bed, legs in the air, begging for a tummy rub. \u201cUm, is Hector on drugs or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe one of Mom\u2019s plants is a cat narcotic. God knows he chews on them enough\u2014every plant in the house has teeth marks. Drives Mom insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma tried putting Tabasco sauce on the leaves. Worked pretty well.\u201d</p> <p>We laugh, imagining the effects of this on an unsuspecting Hector. \u201cYour grandma was an evil genius.\u201d</p><p>I remember her so much more clearly than I remember Mom. \u201cYeah, she was.\u201d I stare at the ceiling. \u201cRight before you picked me up, my father asked if I wanted to go for a run tomorrow morning, \u2018like old times.\u2019 I was standing there in that revolting yellow room with that flowery duvet and furniture that looks like an animal has gnawed on it, and I was thinking \u2018old times\u2019\u2014like when I was what, five?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s silent for a couple of minutes. \u201cAre you afraid if you talked to him, you might actually tell him how angry you are?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s true. This is not standard annoyance. I\u2019m livid. \u201cMaybe. Why now? Why now do I give a crap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always given a crap, Emma. You just pushed it inside. Acted like a miniature grownup. What else could you do? Of course you\u2019re angry.\u201d</p><p>I suddenly burst into tears like one of those geysers in Yellowstone erupts\u2014pop, pop, gush, and she sits up and grabs me, pulls me close and stretches her arms around me.</p> <p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do now?\u201d I hiccup, sniffling.</p><p>She sighs. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not the best timing, right in the middle of filming the biggest movie of your career so far, but emotional self-awareness doesn\u2019t always sit around waiting for the perfect time to reveal itself.\u201d She hands me the tissue box. \u201cYou\u2019ll wash your face so you don\u2019t scare my parents, then we\u2019ll eat the pasta and sausage meatballs they\u2019re making, watch some bad television or a good DVD, and munch something calorific. And after that, we\u2019ll figure this shit out.\u201d</p><p>I take a shuddering breath and lean my head into her lap. She strokes my hair, pulling it from my wet face and tucking it behind my ear, which makes me ache for my mother. I can\u2019t recall her face, exactly, but I remember vividly the feel of her fingers threading through my hair. People are right about time healing wounds. But the scars are always there, waiting for something to poke them. I close my eyes and just let myself miss her.</p><p>Chapter 30</p><p>REID</p><p>I\u2019m geared up for another hour or so of awkward silence on the drive back to LA\u2014even more awkward now that we\u2019ve seen Mom, now that her damage is out there, undeniable, visible to us both. The therapy session was like being cut in a hundred tiny invisible ways, and it\u2019s inexplicable to me how that kind of opening up is helpful.</p><p>I pull out my phone to text John, but before I get far, Dad says, \u201cI made reservations for dinner tonight.\u201d My first thought is why are you telling me? Then I realize he means reservations for us. Oh, hell no.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already made plans with John\u2014\u201d</p> <p>His jaw tightens. \u201cPush them back. Our reservations are early. Seven.\u201d</p><p>My jaw mimics his and I fight to relax it. \u201cFine. I\u2019m staying over with John. Probably tomorrow night, too.\u201d</p><p>He nods curtly and I send John the text telling him to pick me up at ten. A late party is better than no party.</p><p>\u201cHave you thought about what\u2019s next, after School Pride wraps?\u201d</p><p>What\u2019s this? Interest in my career? \u201cGeorge sent a few scripts for me to look over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess there\u2019s no more cold auditioning for you, is there? You\u2019ve arrived, as they say.\u201d</p><p>I shrug.</p><p>The waiter fills our water glasses from a Perrier bottle and leaves it to the side. \u201cWould you gentlemen like to peruse the wine list, or have a cocktail before dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would,\u201d I say.</p><p>Dad shakes his head. \u201cNo thank you. We\u2019ll be ready to order in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d The waiter snaps the wine list closed and removes the wine glasses with one hand, crossing them like Marcie crossed her legs earlier today. Thinking about her doesn\u2019t help my already fed up state of mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Dad?\u201d</p><p>He fixes me with one of the stares he\u2019s perfected after years of cross-examining hapless witnesses. I wait him out. \u201cI\u2019m aware that you drink, despite the fact that you\u2019re considerably underage. You\u2019ve been out from under my direct control for a while now, so I know there\u2019s little to no hope of me influencing that behavior. But you\u2019re not doing it in my presence, out in public. I have a reputation to maintain. So do you, not that you spare any concern for it.\u201d</p><p>Wow. This trip is just one joy-infused moment after another. I should have stayed in Austin. \u201cWhy, exactly, did you decide we needed to have dinner together?\u201d</p><p>He exhales through his nose, his patience as close to snapping as mine, though I can\u2019t imagine why. He could have saved himself the agony by simply leaving me to my own devices for the evening. \u201cI thought you might have questions about your mother\u2019s rehabilitation process. Also I wanted...\u201d he exhales again, his mouth a thin line, \u201c...wanted to thank you for coming this morning. If nothing else, I know you care about her, and I appreciate the effort.\u201d</p><p>If nothing else? What the hell kind of backhanded accolade is that? \u201cI didn\u2019t come for you, so you don\u2019t need to thank me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, I\u2019m thanking you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome. Well, you\u2019re so very welcome. Will that be all?\u201d I sit up, put my napkin on the table.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so hostile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m doing the best I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the best you can do, Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Reid. Let\u2019s not do this here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI concur, counselor. Let\u2019s not do it at all.\u201d I sit back, fix an unnatural smile on my face and try to appear relaxed. \u201cI don\u2019t have any questions concerning Mom\u2019s rehab at this time. I\u2019ll let you or Marcie know if I do.\u201d Marcie had given each of us her card and told us to call or email any time. Riiiight, that was going to happen. \u201cAlso, George and I are considering an action flick for my next project. They want someone older, bigger and more buff to do the part, but George is selling them on the idea that I can be each of those things. I\u2019ll have to train like hell to get the role, but if they give it to me, I\u2019m doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d he says, but it\u2019s an impressed hmph. I haven\u2019t gotten one of those in a while. I hate how good it feels\u2014it totally pisses me off.</p><p>Emma</p><p>\u201cHave you told Emma about Derek?\u201d Emily\u2019s mom asks as we sit down to dinner.</p><p>\u201cAbercrombie boy.\u201d Jason, Emily\u2019s twenty-something brother, moved back home three weeks ago, temporarily between jobs. Again. He makes a hobby of torturing his little sister.</p><p>Emily jerks the basket of rolls out of his reach. He\u2019s already eaten two and was going for a third. \u201cAt least Derek has a job.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Watson starts to laugh and tries to turn it into a cough as his wife gives him a tight-lipped look. Mrs. Watson believes that in order to succeed, young people need emotional support and encouragement. She\u2019s the queen of cheerleading her kids, which worked well with Grant, the oldest, but appears to be backfiring in Jason. Em migrated to her dad\u2019s way of thinking (that sometimes a person needs a swift emotional kick in the pants) when Jason moved back in for the third time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had jobs.\u201d Jason scowls and digs into his pasta.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Emily answers, \u201cbut keeping one seems to elude you. And really? The getting is easy; the keeping is the important part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you know anyth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren!\u201d Mrs. Watson says, and I wonder how that one word doesn\u2019t make Jason go job-hunting immediately, and stay out until he finds one. \u201cEmily, have you asked Emma\u2019s opinion on the homecoming dance?\u201d Uh-oh. I know this is a loaded question before Emily sets her jaw, because when Mrs. Watson invokes my view on something, she\u2019s grasping for already rejected straws.</p><p>\u201cMom, seriously. You\u2019ve gotta stop with the dance thing. We aren\u2019t going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Abercrombie boy didn\u2019t ask you?\u201d Jason snatches a roll from the edge of Emily\u2019s bowl. \u201cWhat, he didn\u2019t want to waste the money to see you wear a new shade of black?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite me, mister perpetually unemployed.\u201d Emily takes a roll from the basket to replace the one he\u2019d stolen. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford to take someone to the Mini-Mart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough! We have a guest!\u201d Mrs. Watson says.</p><p>\u201cEmma\u2019s not a guest,\u201d Jason scoffs. Which is kind of true. I\u2019ve slept over at Emily\u2019s house hundreds of times in my life.</p><p>\u201cJason, do you want dessert tonight or do you want to just go to your room?\u201d his mother asks, no differently than she would have asked (make that did ask) when he was twelve.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Mom, are you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an adult! You can\u2019t send me to my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell she can\u2019t.\u201d Mr. Watson glares at his son. I\u2019ve watched them do this tag team maneuver on all three of their kids. Resistance is futile. You\u2019d think Jason would know that by now, but I guess not.</p><p>\u201cDad, Jesus\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it! To your room.\u201d Mr. Watson points as though Jason needs directions. I bite the inside of my cheek and sneak a look at Emily. Her lips were pressed so tightly together that they\u2019re losing color. On the counter is some sort of berry cobbler, and a big scoop of that stuff has our names on it, so we\u2019re not getting ourselves sent anywhere.</p><p>\u201cThis sucks.\u201d Jason pushes away from the table, taking his roll. \u201cI need my own place.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Jason is out of earshot, Mr. Watson mumbles, \u201cNow there\u2019s a notion.\u201d</p><p>Emily turns to her mother. \u201cMom, no one goes to that incredibly sucktastic dance. Everyone just goes to the game. Things have changed since you went to high school.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSee there, Vera, it\u2019s how they roll nowadays,\u201d her dad says, and I swear it\u2019s all Emily and I can do not to lose it. Emily\u2019s parents bought a book called Decode Your Teen! when Grant was in high school, and are oblivious to the fact that adolescent lingo changes daily.</p><p>Hours later, we lie in Emily\u2019s bed, stuffed with raspberry cobbler and fresh whipped cream.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the deal with Abercrombie boy?\u201d</p><p>Emily sits up and hits me in the face with her pillow, and I squeal. \u201cYour brother is a bad influence!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy brother is a tool.\u201d She stuffs the pillow back behind her head.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s the deal with Derek, then?\u201d</p><p>She throws an arm across her face. \u201cIt\u2019s hopeless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopeless how?\u201d I turn on my side, watching her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re complete opposites. He\u2019s super prep boy. He wears khaki chinos. He\u2019s never even heard of most of my favorite bands, and I\u2019ve spent years making fun of his. I have purple stripes in my hair. Piercings in places I had to have parental permission to get. My favorite nail polish is called Vampire State Building. All of his friends think I\u2019m a freak.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid he tell you that?\u201d I ask, and she turns on her side to face me.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have to tell me. I can see it on their stupid faces.\u201d</p><p>I sweep her purple-accented hair out of her eyes. \u201cWho cares what they think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh come on, all that \u2018If they\u2019re your real friends, they\u2019ll accept whoever you love\u2019 is a load of crap. I can\u2019t expect a guy to stand up to that kind of pressure. And I like me the way I am. I don\u2019t want to change!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he asked you to change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says, sounding almost disappointed.</p> <p>\u201cSo how much do you like this guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God. So much.\u201d She turns into me and buries her face under my chin, her voice desolate, as though she\u2019s confessing to murder instead of attraction.</p><p>\u201cSounds like a bungee-jumping sorta moment.\u201d</p><p>She nods her head.</p><p>\u201cEmma?\u201d My name is muffled by the comforter. \u201cI think I already fell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess all you can do is wait to see if the cord holds.\u201d</p><p>Funny how I can in no way apply this wisdom to myself, no matter how sensible it sounds when I say it to Emily.</p><p>Chapter 31</p> <p>REID</p><p>I have every intention of taking a break from hookups while I\u2019m pursuing Emma, but this party is full of hot girls who are flying so high they don\u2019t know which end is up. The invitation to ditch my temporary abstinence plan is powerful. Plus, Emma and I aren\u2019t actually together yet. She\u2019s taking her own sweet time about that, though I think we\u2019re getting there. I came home to LA this weekend certain I could be patient... but every moment that goes by is draining that resolve.</p><p>The exclusivity factor of this little gathering is high. I\u2019ve recognized several film colleagues and a couple of John\u2019s friends\u2014trust fund babies who live for rubbing elbows (and other body parts) with movie stars and music idols. Highly unlikely that anything will turn up on the Internet. Non-celebrities who get invited to these events understand that outing any of us puts them on the other side of that door in the future. That\u2019s why you seldom see photos of famous people misbehaving in private settings. Figuring out who narced amongst a restricted set of people is far too easy.</p><p>I\u2019m both buzzed and high, lounging in a chair and watching the curls of smoke rise from half a dozen joints. John has his tongue down the throat of an aspiring runway model as they paw each other in the space cleared for people pretending to dance. Really they\u2019re all just committing foreplay in front of anyone watching. John really digs models. The foreign ones, especially. This one looks and sounds, I don\u2019t know, Swedish? I\u2019m not the best judge at this point.</p><p>Tonight, I\u2019m a voyeur. I can reign this in and wait.</p><p>And then some girl a few feet from John is dancing with another girl and the two of them are taking each other\u2019s clothes off. Slowly. Once they have my attention, they\u2019re both flicking glances my way at regular intervals, to make sure I\u2019m still watching. No problem there\u2014I\u2019m riveted.</p><p>Damn. I\u2019m not getting through the next half an hour without tossing my short-lived celibacy out the window, let alone the rest of the night, and I know it.</p><p>John\u2019s model is in the shower. He\u2019s too soft. My two were sent home in a taxi while it was still dark out. Now, he and I are sprawled on the sofa in our usual Sunday morning state: hungover. \u201cWhat are we doing tonight, man?\u201d John blows a few rings of smoke from the cigarette between his fingers, like a cartoon smokestack from a train. One of those people who smokes irregularly, he\u2019s curiously gifted with the stuff he can do with a cigarette, especially considering how infrequently he picks one up. He\u2019s made an art of it. \u201cDo you want to go out?\u201d</p><p>I watch the smoke rings dissipate, lay my head back against the cushion. The shower goes off. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Sure. Nothing high-profile, though.\u201d</p><p>The bathroom door snaps open. \u201cJohn?\u201d His name in her mouth sounds more like Jonah\u2014two syllables.</p><p>His eyebrows kick up once before he rolls off the sofa. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>She asks for a towel. He slips into the bathroom to show her where they\u2019re kept, and stays in. The sound of giggling pushes through the door, and I pick up the remote and click on the television. My voyeuristic tendencies have explicit limits, and listening to John screw some chick in the bathroom is definitely outside that perimeter. On the screen a correspondent reports on a politician who got caught cheating on his wife with their kid\u2019s nanny... who\u2019s in the country illegally.</p><p>My first thought is what a moron, and then they show a photo of the hot Guatemalan nanny. Damn\u2014that poor bastard was doomed from the start.</p><p>Emma</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just not sure this is such a great idea.\u201d I sit in Emily\u2019s vintage Sentra, staring at the house. \u201cTalking to my father how I feel is always an exercise in frustration, Em. There\u2019s no way I can tell him all the stuff we talked about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen start with the college thing. Tell him you want to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cYou said you did last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt safe talking to you about it. It\u2019s different, bringing it up to him. He\u2019ll probably just say no, anyway, even if I manage to argue my point adequately, which is doubtful if he starts objecting right off. Plus I\u2019m half scared to death that if he actually lets me do it, it might be a huge mistake.\u201d I hear the panic building in my voice. \u201cI could flunk out. I could ruin the career I have. Emily, if that happens, what else do I have?\u201d</p><p>She grabs my hand. \u201cEmma, what the hell. A few hours ago, you were way more certain of yourself. It\u2019s like the sight of this place scares the confidence right out of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know me. He only thinks he does. I\u2019ve just followed along my whole life, no big rebellion, barely any disagreement. I always thought that at least he understands my need to be an actor. But what if that isn\u2019t him understanding me at all, what if that\u2019s just what he wants, and what he really understands is nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your dad, Emma,\u201d she says, still holding my hand.</p><p>\u201cEm, sometimes you and your parents argue. Yell at each other even. But you know they\u2019re trying. You know they love you.\u201d My throat feels tight. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same with me and them. It never has been. You know that as well as anybody.\u201d</p><p>She pulls me in for a hug. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to talk to him, then don\u2019t. But I think you should go in there and say what you need to say. For your own sake. Because yeah, you\u2019re almost eighteen, and it\u2019s your life, and maybe this is the first step to just telling someone besides me what you want out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to start, what to say.\u201d I\u2019m stalling, and we both know it.</p><p>\u201cYes you do. Go in there. Just say it.\u201d Emily has this way about her when she knows she\u2019s right. Compassionate, but persistent. I take a deep breath, and go inside.</p><p>My father\u2019s sitting in his reading chair with a business magazine spread across his lap. He reads them all, in paper form and online. I fear the usual smallness of my voice. \u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d I say, too loudly, because I have to force it out. He startles and the magazine jerks in his hands.</p><p>He exhales. \u201cOkay. What\u2019s up?\u201d Looking at my face, he reads something there that changes his expression from interest to wariness. \u201cUm, Chloe will be home in an hour or so, if this is something important ...\u201d</p><p>I ignore that, clear my throat and sit, my hands clenching each other on my knees. No way in hell I\u2019m waiting for Chloe to return. \u201cI, uh... I want to go to college.\u201d Sitting on the sofa across the room from him, I wait while the silence lengthens between us. I think maybe he\u2019s in shock, and I wait for him to snap out of it.</p><p>He frowns, puzzled. \u201cYou do? You\u2019ve never mentioned this before...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just been thinking lately, with high school almost done, you know... What\u2019s next? I\u2019ve been talking to other cast members who are planning to go, and I started considering the idea. And I decided I want to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...\u201d he says after a moment. \u201cDo you have a university in mind? A course of study?\u201d I look at him, searching for potential disparagement. I don\u2019t see any. Not that this means there isn\u2019t any. But I don\u2019t see it.</p><p>I swallow the lump in my throat, the half-dozen arguments Emily and I formulated last night jumbling together in my head, like I stopped short in the middle of the path and they all ran into me. And then I realize he\u2019s not saying no. \u201cTheatre, I think. I don\u2019t know where, yet. I can start checking out places online, looking at requirements and stuff. I need to take the SAT...\u201d My eyes slide to the floor. \u201cUm, how will I pay the tuition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ve got that covered with your Coogan account. After School Pride wraps up, you\u2019ll have more than enough, if you\u2019re sure that\u2019s what you want to use it for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d I\u2019m more sure about this than I\u2019ve ever been about anything.</p><p>\u201cIs there... anything else?\u201d</p><p>I look at him, and I can\u2019t say any more. As high as this one thing leaves me, as giddy with truth-telling as I feel, I\u2019m not ready to bare my soul just yet.</p><p>\u201cUm, no.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, relieved. \u201cOkay then. Well, you should probably go get ready for dinner. I think Chloe\u2019s planned a fun night out for your last night home.\u201d</p><p>Doubtful. But I\u2019m not in the mood to dissent, so I nod and walk to my room in a sort of daze, shower and get ready to go out. Tomorrow I\u2019m going back to Austin. And maybe I\u2019ll try a little of this honesty business on Reid when I get there.</p><p>Or not.</p><p>As I wait for the boarding announcement, I try to get some reading done for English, but give up after attempting to reread the same page of A Room of One\u2019s Own for the third time. I can\u2019t concentrate on the words in front of me. Bookmarking the page, I stuff the book in my bag and pull my iPod from a side pocket, pondering the changes that one conversation with my father could set in motion, in both my immediate future and long-term. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As far as I can tell, he hasn\u2019t told Chloe a thing.

Okay.\u201d I stood at the counter, gripping the mug. The abstract idea of college was turning more concrete by the minute. Something in my expression must have let him know that the reality of what I was about to do to my life was flooding in.</p><p>\u201cThis is what you want, right?\u201d He stared directly into my eyes, concerned. \u201cAre you sure, Emma?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s perfect.\u201d I sat down at the table with my coffee.</p><p>He nodded once, satisfied, smoothing out the pages of the Wall Street Journal. As he scanned the front page, he said, \u201cI suppose you\u2019ll need to decide where you\u2019re going to apply.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cYeah, I have a lot to think about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have time. Once filming wraps up, we\u2019ll get those applications in, and there will probably be auditions of some sort, assuming you want to start next fall.\u201d My stomach dropped at the realization of what I\u2019d done. I was going to be in class. With other people. In some cases, lots of other people. I can handle being on stage in front of an audience and filming in front of a production crew, but the thought of interacting with a classroom full of people in an academic setting scares the crap out of me. It's almost humorous.</p><p>I scroll through my library of music, barely focusing on the titles and unable to settle on anything. When my phone vibrates, I pull the earbuds out, giving up on both reading and music in a three-minute span of time.</p> <p>Graham: Hey, heading back? Wanna run tomorrow morning?</p><p>Me: Sure. At the airport now.</p><p>Graham: Me too.</p><p>Me: I talked to my dad about college.</p><p>Graham: What did he say??</p><p>Me: He\u2018s signing me up to take the sat in austin in a month. Ugh.</p> <p>Graham: Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll do fine.</p><p>Me: Thanks :)</p><p>Graham: NP. I\u2019m about to board. See you in austin.</p><p>Chapter 32</p><p>REID</p><p>Monday evening, everyone hangs out in my hotel room, sprawled across the bed, sofa and floor space. We order room service while we watch (and mercilessly ridicule) an atrocious eighties movie. Tadd brought his guitar back with him from LA, and he and Graham trade subdued sets while we all discuss our weekends away. There are moments Emma is paying closer attention to them than to the conversations around us. I vaguely remember George telling me a few years back that I should learn to play an instrument. Another of his suggestions that I didn\u2019t follow.</p><p>Emma and I are sitting on the bed, and I\u2019m having a hard time being aware of anything beyond her. I recognize the scent she wears now\u2014sweet and subtle. If I could make everyone in the room disappear right with the snap of my fingers, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate. She sits cross-legged and barefoot, her shoulder brushing mine, her toenails painted a purple so dark it\u2019s almost black. When I look up from her toes, she\u2019s smiling at me, and the girls from Saturday night are a hollow memory, nothing worthwhile to retain.</p><p>Quinton\u2019s ex is making an all-out play to get him back. We were on the same flight back from LA so I know the scoop and already gave him advice he won\u2019t heed. I listen distractedly as he shares his predicament with everyone else.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t home thirty minutes before my ex shows up at the door. My little sister lets her in, almost like someone told her when I\u2019d be home.\u201d He arches an eyebrow.</p><p>Jenna laughs. \u201cAlmost, huh?\u201d</p><p>Tadd\u2019s fingers freeze on the strings. \u201cDude, my ex had sisters. If she decides to butt into your love life, you are so screwed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, what a coincidence, right? So I shut myself in my room, took a nap and then a shower, thinking I\u2019d come out and she\u2019d be gone. But when I opened my bedroom door, the whole damned house smelled like chocolate chip cookies.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cKimber knows I can\u2019t resist those things. They\u2019re like little dollops of heaven.\u201d</p><p>Brooke holds both hands up. \u201cDid you just say little dollops of heaven? I\u2019m taking away your man card if you ever say that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Quinton. What did you do?\u201d MiShaun asks.</p><p>\u201cYou guys don\u2019t understand! This girl, we\u2019ve known each other since we were five. She knows every weakness I\u2019ve got!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got back together with her?\u201d Brooke asks. Quinton runs a hand over his face and nods, and the room erupts with opinions.</p><p>Graham continues to finger chords softly, and then he\u2019s glancing at Emma with half a smile, rolling his eyes. I feel her shoulders vibrate faintly with her silent laughter. Oh, hell no.</p><p>I turn my head and she looks at me. I want to kiss her, but that\u2019s too conspicuous on the jealousy scale\u2014she wasn\u2019t thrilled the last time I did that. Instead, I lean my forehead to hers and speak just above a whisper, ignoring Graham\u2019s existence, asking her silently to do the same. \u201cI missed you. A lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>Something Quinton says sends the rest of the room into hysterical laughter, breaking our connection. Emma glances at her cell phone. \u201cWow, it\u2019s late,\u201d she says, unfolding her legs. \u201cI need to get up early to run. I\u2019d better get to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRunning the first day back? Dedicated.\u201d</p><p>She smiles at me. \u201cIt only works if I\u2019m ruthless about it.\u201d She tells everyone goodnight as I get up to walk her to her door, and I take her hand as we leave the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just never thought of you as the ruthless type. It\u2019s kinda hot. In a scary sort of way.\u201d</p><p>She unlocks her door and turns to me, pushing the lever down and allowing me to press her to the door and shuffle her backwards until the handle hits the wall with a light thump. Bracing a hand against the hard surface on either side of her face, I watch her breath quicken, her chest rise and fall. Her hands are behind her, palms flat to the door. I lean in, kissing her gently, my tongue tracing her lips, opening them to deepen the kiss, my hands moving to her waist.</p><p>She tears her mouth from mine, and we\u2019re both breathing heavily. \u201cCome back to my room,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI\u2019ll go kick everyone out right now. They\u2019ll be gone in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReid...\u201d she says, and I feel as though we\u2019re sparring, bargaining for position along an unseen border. She\u2019s driving me crazy.</p><p>I back away, my hands up like she\u2019s about to read me my rights and toss me in the back of a patrol car. \u201cStopping. I just... haven\u2019t seen you in four days.\u201d</p><p>Her brow creases. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not trying to frustrate you, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help that I want you, you know. I just hope you\u2019ll start trusting me at some point.\u201d She\u2019s outright frowning now, and I tell myself to cut it the hell out before I mess this up completely.</p><p>\u201cReid, what do you mean? I wouldn\u2019t be with someone I didn\u2019t trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we actually \u2018with\u2019 each other, though?\u201d</p><p>Shit, I can\u2019t even listen to good advice from myself.</p><p>A door opens down the hall\u2014my room, from the sound of it. Guess the party is breaking up. Graham and Brooke come around the corner. His eyes sweep over us and Brooke arches an eyebrow at me as if to say she expected as much. \u201cGoodnight, you two.\u201d Her voice purrs with condescension. I fight to keep from responding.</p><p>They disappear into Graham\u2019s room, and I know I have to let this go for tonight. \u201cJust, you know, forget what I said\u2014hell, I\u2019ve already forgotten what I said. It\u2019s been a long day. We have a hard week ahead of us. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d I kiss her one more time, fight down the wave of wanting her, and turn to go back to my room.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if I have any virtues, or the potential for any, but I know one thing. Patience sure as hell isn\u2019t one of them.</p><p>Emma</p><p>I slip into my room and let the door close, change out of my jeans and t-shirt and into an oversized t-shirt and boxers. I can\u2019t forget what Reid said, just because he told me to. So, if we aren\u2019t sleeping together, we aren\u2019t a couple? Is that what he means?</p><p>His question feels too important, like a clue. He thinks I don\u2019t trust him because I\u2019m not ready to have sex. Maybe in some way, that\u2019s true. Maybe I don\u2019t trust him to want any more of me than that, and just sleeping with Reid Alexander isn\u2019t good enough for me. Or maybe I don\u2019t know what I want, and he\u2019s suffering my indecision.</p><p>Unpacking as I brush my teeth, I force my thoughts elsewhere, wondering what\u2019s going on two doors down in Graham\u2019s room. I probably don\u2019t want to know. A lifetime has passed since Graham and I sat on my balcony, eating chocolate cake and talking about parts of our lives that are long gone. Brooke and Reid have made their desires known concerning each of us, and Graham and I are playing along, even if I\u2019m not capitulating as fully or as rapidly as Reid would like.</p><p>I rinse my mouth of toothpaste and stride across the room to the balcony, pull the door open and go outside into the warm darkness. He\u2019s there on his balcony, alone, staring at the sky, and I exhale in relief without knowing why. The sight of him is comforting. The fact that he\u2019s alone, almost as much so, though there\u2019s no good reason for me to feel that way.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d he says, turning. I half expect to see a cigarette in his hand, but he stands with his hands hooked in the pockets of his jeans. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks, concern in his voice.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m, uh, I\u2019m fine.\u201d And I\u2019m trying in vain to come up with any explanation for why I rushed onto my balcony to spy on him. Like it\u2019s my business if a twenty-year-old single guy, who doesn\u2019t at all belong to me, hooks up with a beautiful girl. \u201cEr, I was just getting some air.\u201d Wow. Lame.</p><p>\u201cOh-kay,\u201d he says, unconvinced.</p><p>\u201cWell. I\u2019ve gotten some. Air, that is. So I guess I\u2019ll go in now.\u201d</p><p>I spin around to escape back inside, feeling like an idiot. \u201cEmma?\u201d</p><p>I attempt to compose my expression as I turn back. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re... running in the morning, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix o\u2019clock, then?\u201d he asks, and I nod. We both stand there for a moment, the silence lengthening and feeling significant, until his cell rings from inside his room. \u201cSee you in the morning,\u201d he says, going inside. I hear him say, \u201cHello?\u201d before he shuts the balcony door.</p><p>Since I got back from Sacramento, Graham and I have been discussing college applications and essays, schools and programs available during our morning runs. He\u2019s enthusiastic about it, and it\u2019s contagious. He\u2019s texting me names of schools to check out: Julliard and NYU, I recognize, and other smaller schools I don\u2019t. Some have smaller populations than Emily\u2019s high school. I think I might like that.</p><p>When I ask him why so many of the schools he suggests are in New York, he shrugs and says, \u201cThat\u2019s where I live, so I know more about the area, since I wanted to go to school close to home. Do you want to stay closer to home yourself? We could look for schools you might like in California.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Staying near my parents is the last thing I want. A school on the opposite coast from Chloe is exactly what I need. \u201cNo, moving across the country sounds lovely.\u201d He laughs while I tell myself this has nothing to do with Graham living in New York. Nothing at all.</p><p>I start googling information on anything he suggests that\u2019s located east of Ohio.</p><p>The Bingley house would send Chloe into raptures of envy. Set into the side of a hill, it\u2019s several thousand feet of limestone, wrought iron and tile exterior, with soaring ceilings and marble floors throughout. No amenities were omitted, from a kitchen outfitted so spectacularly that it would make Emily\u2019s mom drool to the infinity pool that would cause Chloe to break into song. I feel an urge to cross myself at that thought.</p><p>The first two days of the week are spent filming what will be a three-minute scene with Meredith under the hood of the broken down Civic, in front of this beautiful house. Outside. In the billion degree heat.</p> <p>Production hired an auto mechanic expert to help me look like I know the difference between a fuel pump and a spark plug while under the hood of a car, because for some reason not explained to me, present-day Lizbeth is familiar with the basics of auto maintenance. First I have to learn how to get the hood of the car up, which is not as easy as you\u2019d think. Stan the mechanic is gallingly superior about it, rolling his eyes while my fingers slide back and forth where the stupid latch release is supposedly located. I\u2019m forced to squat down and look for it.</p><p>\u201cAh-ha!\u201d I release the latch as Stan stands with his burly, tattooed arms crossed over his chest, unimpressed. I narrow my eyes at him. \u201cOkay, so I know nothing about cars. Can you make yourself cry on command? Go ahead. I\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>He sighs and shows me again where to find the latch release. Once I can find it without looking, he drops the hood and has me find and unlatch it at least fifty times, until I can do it blindfolded. Ah, the useful yet trivial things I learn for my job.</p><p>Given the heat and humidity, our makeup people want to pull their hair out, and ours. Meredith and I ride back to the hotel at the end of the second day in exhausted silence, in love with the guy who invented air conditioning. The cityscape flows by as I dissect the reasons for my caution with Reid. I\u2019m not immune to the way I feel when he touches me. The truth is, physically, I do want him\u2014I\u2019m just not quite ready emotionally. The more he pushes, the more wary I feel, and the more I want to push back.</p><p>Then there\u2019s Graham, who hasn\u2019t mentioned my weird behavior on the balcony Monday night, thank God. For a fleeting moment, I wonder if he was on his balcony for the same reason I was, hoping I would come out by myself, or just hoping I wasn\u2019t in bed with Reid.</p> <p>Abruptly, I come to my senses. How preposterous, that Graham is absorbed with or even thinking about whatever transpires, or doesn\u2019t, between Reid and me. He has his own thing with Brooke to sort out.</p><p>Not that his relationship with her has any relevance to me.</p><p>Chapter 33</p><p>REID</p><p>I filmed with Tadd and Brooke today\u2014indoor scenes that will be woven into the outdoor scenes Emma and Meredith did yesterday. I wasn\u2019t feeling well last night, so I went to bed early. I woke up with a hell of a hangover that wasn\u2019t a hangover. I can\u2019t describe it, really. I didn\u2019t think I drank that much last night, but I can\u2019t remember.</p><p>I got through filming, didn\u2019t have a single conflict with Brooke, which is really bizarre. All I know is I feel like shit and I don\u2019t want to be awake. I should just go to bed and sleep it off\u2014whatever this is. I should probably text Emma, but I can do that when I wake up.</p> <p>Emma</p><p>I haven\u2019t heard from Reid today. No calls, no texts, no knocks on my door. After a leisurely morning with Meredith, discussing the novels we\u2019ve chosen for our senior theses, we had French class with Jenna and made plans for dinner which I assume includes everyone. I walk past Reid\u2019s door, annoyed. The silent treatment must be some form of male pouting.</p><p>Emily\u2019s previous boyfriend, Vic, pushed her to have sex. At first, she told me that they had been together for several months and maybe she should give it up, even if she wasn\u2019t particularly moved to do so yet. And then he began saying things like, \u201cIf I\u2019d known you were going to be such a tease...\u201d and, \u201cI\u2019m a guy. You have to admit I\u2019ve been patient.\u201d The last straw occurred in the school cafeteria, where they were sitting with his friends.</p><p>\u201cHey Vic, how can you tell if a girl is frigid?\u201d His friend paused for effect. \u201cWhen you open her legs, a light goes on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDing,\u201d Vic said, glancing at Emily as his friends laughed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not funny,\u201d she said, knowing then that he\u2019d told his friends what was going on between them. Or more accurately, what wasn\u2019t going on.</p><p>\u201cDing!\u201d echoed Vic\u2019s most obnoxious friend, a guy Emily tolerated only because she cared for Vic.</p><p>She got up and left the table to a chorus of dings, and Vic did nothing but laugh and call after her, \u201cCome on, baby\u2014Jesus, it\u2019s just a joke!\u201d</p> <p>She found out a week after they broke up that he\u2019d been sleeping with a sophomore from his art class for at least a month, maybe longer. He\u2019d been telling Emily that the girl had a crush on him but he was keeping it strictly platonic.</p><p>\u201cSince when is platonic synonymous with screwing around?\u201d she asked him during their last fight, which occurred right after she found out.</p><p>\u201cNewsflash, Emily\u2014you and me are broken up, so technically, you have no jurisdiction over me anymore. But let me give you a parting tip\u2014it\u2019s a stretch to call it screwing around on your girlfriend when she won\u2019t screw around with you in the first place.\u201d</p><p>She and I heaped curses on Vic\u2019s big stupid head for this preposterous excuse, but I\u2019ll be damned if it didn\u2019t seep into my brain just enough for Reid\u2019s pushing to make me wonder if there was any legitimacy to it.</p><p>I\u2019m tired of Reid\u2019s moping. I want to let him know he can\u2019t manipulate me, but I also want to see it coming if he\u2019s going to use the Vic justification. Unsure exactly what I intend to say but determined to say it, I turn back and knock on his door. A minute later he hasn\u2019t answered, but just as I start to turn away, the door opens.</p><p>The last thing I expect to see is Reid bowed over, an arm across his abdomen. His usually perfect hair is plastered to his forehead and he looks pale.</p><p>\u201cReid? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. No. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t feel so hot, Emma. I\u2019ve been sleeping since I got back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to get someone? A doctor?\u201d</p><p>He blinks slowly. \u201cI\u2019m just going to go back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I bring you something\u2014soup maybe\u2014from the caf\u00e9? I\u2019ll be back in twenty minutes. Give me your room key, so you won\u2019t have to get up again.\u201d</p><p>He backs into the room, pointing to the dresser. \u201cIt\u2019s on my wallet.\u201d As I grab the room key, he collapses onto the bed with a moan.</p><p>\u201cReid, are you sure you don\u2019t need a doctor?\u201d He shakes his head, and I\u2019m unsure what to do except go get him something that I\u2019m pretty sure he isn\u2019t going to eat.</p><p>By the time I return, he\u2019s gone from pale to flushed. I\u2019ve brought chicken noodle soup and Sprite, but he doesn\u2019t take more than a sip of either. His knees are drawn up, both hands on his stomach, eyes closed. Placing my hand on his forehead, I know something is really wrong because he\u2019s burning up. \u201cAre you nauseous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he answers after a minute. \u201cYou should probably leave. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m contagious. Tell Richter I might not feel like filming tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He\u2019s probably right, the best thing for me to do is leave, but I can\u2019t abandon him like that.</p><p>My phone buzzes from my bag\u2014a text from Graham.</p><p>Graham: Hey, you coming? We\u2019re about to grab some taxis.</p><p>Me: I\u2019m in reid\u2019s room. I think he\u2019s sick.</p><p>Graham: Sick how?</p><p>Me: I don\u2019t know. Fever. He\u2019s clutching his stomach but no throwing up...yet.</p><p>Graham: Be up in a minute.</p><p>Me: K, thx</p><p>I wet a washcloth under the cold tap, pull Reid\u2019s damp hair off of his forehead, and press the cloth to his head. He sighs but never opens his eyes.</p><p>Graham\u2019s knock is soft. I open the door to admit him, saying, \u201cI hope I\u2019m not exposing you to something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019okay.\u201d He takes a disposable thermometer from a small paper bag and smiles. \u201cGift shop.\u201d Reid barely registers him coming into the room.</p><p>A few minutes later, I don\u2019t feel so reactionary. \u201cOne hundred three,\u201d Graham says. \u201cWe need to get a doctor up here.\u201d</p><p>I call the PA, who calls Reid\u2019s personal assistant for the film, Andrew, who locates a doctor willing to make hotel calls. Andrew is one of dozens of usually invisible film crew personnel. His celebrity assistant skills, until tonight, were primarily utilized for caramel macchiato runs and dry cleaning supervision. Tonight, he\u2019s in Reid\u2019s room, pacing back and forth in the sitting area, calling Reid\u2019s parents, manager and agent. Graham calls room service and orders sandwiches, charged to his room. When I try to object, he tells me I have to eat.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014you were supposed to go to dinner with everyone!\u201d I say.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s no problem. I told them to go ahead.\u201d</p><p>When the doctor arrives, Andrew, Graham and I are banished to the hallway while she examines Reid. There\u2019s one anguished cry from the room, freezing Andrew and me in place, wide-eyed. Graham takes my shoulders and stares into my eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>The doctor opens the door to let us back into the room. \u201cWe need to do a scan to check for appendicitis.\u201d She\u2019s already called the front desk to get an ambulance to the hotel. \u201cDoes he have family nearby?\u201d she asks, and Andrew starts dialing like a man possessed.</p><p>Graham and I follow the ambulance in a taxi. He holds my hand all the way there, and in the waiting room, where we spend the evening. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d he repeats, after we\u2019re told Reid is going into surgery; the doctor was correct in her initial diagnosis. \u201cWhat if you hadn\u2019t checked on him, or if you\u2019d listened when he tried to just go back to sleep?\u201d</p><p>Andrew talks and texts non-stop, pacing by the windows and occasionally outside, where I suspect he\u2019s looking for somewhere to light up. Hospitals don\u2019t exactly cater to smokers. I lean my head on Graham\u2019s shoulder, thankful he showed up with a thermometer, that he knew what to do. My eyes drift closed, and I realize I\u2019ve been asleep when I sit up and my neck feels stiff. He shifts, his hand massaging the tight muscles, pressing me back to his chest, his heartbeat in my ear.</p><p>Pacing a metaphorical groove into the floor in an effort to obtain and relay news about the surgery, Andrew buzzes between the waiting area and the nurses\u2019 station. The nurses, at first star-struck, quickly become pissed. \u201cHe\u2019s. Still. In. Surgery,\u201d one of them says, teeth gritted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Andrew responds, and Graham laughs quietly as I giggle into his shirt.</p><p>Minutes later, Andrew walks over and holds out his cell. \u201cRichter wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>I take the phone. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, kiddo, I appreciate you being observant enough to realize Reid needed help. If this had gone overnight, he could have been in big trouble.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was more Graham than me.\u201d My eyes flick to him and he squeezes my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWell, you two possibly saved his life. You don\u2019t need to stay, though. I\u2019m sure Andrew can take care of whatever needs to be done tonight.\u201d Andrew, jittery, does look prepared to jump on whatever task needs doing.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be back as soon as he gets out of surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Give me Andrew so I can make sure he knows how to reach everyone.\u201d I hand over the phone and Andrew strides for the exit, talking. Time for another cigarette break.</p><p>I turn to Graham. \u201cHow are those patches working?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPretty well, actually. I still have issues with my hands sometimes, though, because I\u2019m used to holding a cigarette. Not sure what to do with them.\u201d He flexes his fingers and turns his hands palm up, staring down at them as though they belong to someone else. I take the one nearest me without looking at him, and we sit, silently holding hands, until the doctor comes to tell us that Reid is in recovery.</p><p>The filming schedule is modified to substitute the few remaining scenes that don\u2019t include Reid; he\u2019ll be out a solid week, possibly two. Since he\u2019s one of the two main characters, we do some scenes partially\u2014a stand-in representing Reid\u2019s side of a conversation, or one of us filming a one-sided conversation, his portion to be filmed later, with everything spliced together in the final cut.</p><p>Production arranges for us to use the Bennet house again ahead of schedule, and Meredith and I do an emotional scene where her character, Jane, realizes that the guy she loves is gone with no plans to come back. I know from her concentration just before we begin filming that she\u2019s mining her recent breakup for emotional effect. She tells me that she wishes she could use something else, but she knows her leftover feelings for her ex are the nearest thing to a shared experience with her character.</p><p>\u201cI talked to Robby last night,\u201d she says as we wait for the set to be readied.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I study her face, and even with the expertly applied makeup, I can tell she had a rough night. Red-rimmed eyes, dark circles still visible under the delicate skin.</p><p>\u201cHe says he misses me. I\u2019m not an idiot... but it\u2019s so tempting. I know him. He knows me. I\u2019m just afraid that what I\u2019m feeling for him will never be over. Like if I let him go, I\u2019ll just die alone and miserable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMeredith.\u201d I grab her arm, wait until she looks at me. \u201cPlease tell me you know better than that. Or else I\u2019m going to have to argue with you about not being an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know better,\u201d she mumbles. I lower my chin and stare at her. \u201cI do. I don\u2019t want to love him,\u201d she says miserably.</p><p>\u201cMere, what kind of person expects someone he loves to give up what she wants to be, what she needs to do? That\u2019s not love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She\u2019s listening but not hearing, and I want to shake her. \u201cYou know what, Emma?\u201d She sighs. \u201cLove freaking sucks.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 34</p><p>REID</p><p>I wake up in a hospital room, and George is sitting on the small sofa. A few seconds pass while I process what happened yesterday. Difficult, because my brain feels numb from what is undoubtedly some sort of analgesic. My manager glances up when I stir. \u201cReid. Going to stay awake for a few minutes this time?\u201d He comes to stand next to the bed. \u201cThey\u2019re keeping you a little sedated, so you won\u2019t move around.\u201d</p><p>I look at the IV in my arm. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d God, my throat feels like I swallowed sand.</p> <p>\u201cYour appendix decided it didn\u2019t care for Austin so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. I was supposed to film today.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, George says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, directors tend to let people off to recuperate from emergency surgery. Everything\u2019s taken care of\u2014private room, of course, and your medical care is being filed and paid, so you needn\u2019t worry about that. Your bodyguard is outside the door, and Andrew will be by in a little while to run errands for whatever you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>I look down at the worn, mint-colored hospital gown. \u201cTell him not to even bother coming unless he brings me something else to wear. Shorts, t-shirts... I\u2019m not wearing this.\u201d I pick at one of the stupid ties at the side of the gown. \u201cSo I guess Dad couldn\u2019t make it, huh? Sent you as his parental doppelganger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you aren\u2019t happy to see me?\u201d George looks slighted. He should win a mini-Oscar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m complaining about the absence, not the substitution. Of course I appreciate you coming. Why it would surprise me that he\u2019s not here, I have no idea. I mean hell, it\u2019s just major surgery. No big deal.\u201d My eyes are heavy; I\u2019m sleepy already.</p><p>George grimaces, one hand on my arm. \u201cGo back to sleep, get healed up. We\u2019ll work on your daddy issues another time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa, ha. Funny guy, George. That\u2019s why I like you.\u201d</p><p>Late afternoon the next day, Emma walks in, carrying a vase of Asian lilies. Maybe it\u2019s the drugs, but her face above the flowers makes me imagine her as a faery. \u201cHey you,\u201d she says. Tadd and Quinton are with her.</p><p>I mute the reality show blaring from the way-too-small television bolted to the wall. \u201cThank God, I\u2019m bored out of my mind.\u201d</p><p>She smiles at me. \u201cWe figured as much.\u201d She places the flowers on the built-in veneer dresser and Quinton hands me gaming magazines.</p><p>\u201cDude, you look like ass,\u201d Tadd says.</p><p>I shake my head, try not to laugh because it hurts. \u201cTact. Ever heard of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTact is overrated,\u201d Tadd says, eyeing the television. \u201cHey, I bet I could get a game console and a couple of controllers hooked up to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I think I\u2019m getting out of here tomorrow. If I promise to be good, I can convalesce at the hotel. The doc says I\u2019ll still be in bed for four to five more days, and not in a good way.\u201d I wink at Emma and she blushes the slightest pink. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in prison here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guard dog is at the door.\u201d Quinton refers to Bob, who\u2019s sitting on a chair in the hall, blocking fan and paparazzi intrusions.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we had an incident with a hospital volunteer earlier.\u201d I laugh and goddamn, it\u2019s like someone stabbed me. I push a call button.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Alexander?\u201d Young, with a little bit of a Southern lilt. Nurse Monica.</p><p>\u201cI could use some pain meds, please ma\u2019am.\u201d Tadd quirks an eyebrow at my please ma\u2019am, and I pretend not to notice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of volunteer?\u201d Emma asks.</p><p>\u201cThe doing community service for prep school credit type. Allegedly, she took some photographic liberties with my sedated body and a strategically unbuttoned candy-striper outfit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa! Was she at least hot?\u201d Quinton says, then turns to Emma. \u201cNo offense.\u201d</p><p>She blinks at him. \u201cUm, none taken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea. I was drugged out. Bob let her in since she was dressed in hospital threads and had ID, but he had a weird feeling so he checked, and there I was, being violated by an underage candy-striper.\u201d</p><p>Nurse Monica comes in with a syringe, which she injects into my IV line. Tendrils of her copper hair escape from the twist at her nape, and Quinton is staring, not that I can blame him.</p><p>\u201cThere ya go. You should feel that real soon.\u201d She lays her fingers on the bare skin of my forearm, blinking when Tadd stifles a laugh, abruptly jerking her hand away. Clearing her throat, she straightens the bedding. \u201cDo you need anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019m good.\u201d She blushes and hurries from the room.</p><p>\u201cSure you don\u2019t need your pillow fluffed, or maybe a sponge bath?\u201d Tadd mocks.</p><p>\u201cSo did your juvie stalker sext anything before Bob intervened?\u201d Quinton asks. \u201cCause that could get ugly. In a legal sort of way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, Bob came in, grabbed her phone, walkied for hospital security, and scrolled through her messages. She hadn\u2019t sent anything yet. She attacked him when he started deleting photos\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe attacked Bob?\u201d Emma asks. \u201cBob\u2019s the size of a tank!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right? But yeah. He held her by the wrists with one hand while deleting photos with the other until hospital security busted in. Tragically, during all the madness, her phone was accidentally crushed under his ginormous foot and the memory card went AWOL.\u201d</p><p>Emma smirks. \u201cSounds like Bob is worth his weight in gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Bob\u2019s case, that\u2019s really saying something,\u201d Tadd agrees.</p><p>Emma</p><p>After the guys leave, I stay to keep Reid company for the rest of visiting hours, like I did last night. He\u2019s alert today, though still a little groggy from the painkillers the nurse just gave him; last night he was drugged to the hilt, in and out of awareness\u2014mostly out, and I was glad I brought something to read.</p><p>He\u2019s wearing a baby blue t-shirt and black jersey shorts today, rather than the hospital gown. \u201cSo is this authorized hospital-wear?\u201d</p><p>He ducks his chin, peering roguishly through a few strands of blond hair\u2014clean, which makes me wonder who\u2019d washed it for him\u2014the ginger-headed nurse? \u201cNot exactly, but I tend to get my way about stuff, or haven\u2019t you noticed?\u201d Only he could deliver such a line and have it come out charming and not insufferable. \u201cDid you say they moved filming to the Bennet house? I seriously can\u2019t remember what we talked about last night, sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were pretty out of it.\u201d</p><p>He scoots over in the bed to make room for me, grimacing slightly. \u201cCome here. You\u2019re too far away.\u201d I leave the small sofa and climb up next to him, careful not to jostle him or mash his IV line. He takes my hand and kisses the palm. \u201cI hear I owe you a debt of gratitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you were obviously unwell, anyone could have seen that.\u201d</p><p>His mouth turns up on one side. \u201cThe point is, you were that anyone. Though, was Graham there, too? I\u2019m fuzzy on that whole night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah, I told him you weren\u2019t feeling well, so he came up. He was actually the one who knew you needed a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were the one who checked on me in the first place. Besides, no offense to Graham, but I\u2019d rather thank you.\u201d His eyes are warm, staring into mine, and I brush his hair out of his eyes, feeling guilty, because I didn\u2019t go to Reid\u2019s door to check on him. I went to his door to tell him off.</p><p>Not that he needs to know that.</p><p>He leans closer and kisses me, withdrawing with a grimace and leaning back against the mound of pillows. He must have commandeered every pillow on this floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine as long as I don\u2019t move at all.\u201d He takes my hand and pulls me closer, so that I\u2019m kissing him. \u201cMmm, better.\u201d His blue eyes open and he lifts a hand to my face, fingers coaxing me forward, into another kiss. \u201cMuch better.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 35</p><p>REID</p> <p>I move back to the hotel to recuperate while everyone else continues filming around the scenes I\u2019m supposed to be in, leaving me bored as hell. I\u2019ve never had to sit out before\u2014no illnesses, no injuries. Dad would be shocked to know I\u2019m losing it over not being able to work.</p><p>Everyone drops in occasionally to hang out, and Emma keeps me company whenever she\u2019s free, which isn\u2019t often on filming and class days. Having her near naturally results in us getting physical, but there\u2019s only so far I can go without pain. For days now, we\u2019ve been kissing and touching for one or two hours straight. Emma is leaving my room more breathless after these restrained makeouts than she ever has.</p><p>Today I went on location to watch her film a scene. My leaving the hotel room caused Andrew so much stress that we thought his head would explode. He threatened to call my doctor, my father and George. I glared at him and suggested a cigarette break. He spun on his heel and stomped from the room.</p><p>Emma has been anxious about this scene, which includes Leslie and Tim, both Oscar contenders, as well as Jenna, the perpetually self-confident fifteen-year-old. The majority of primary dialogue is Emma\u2019s, though, and the timing has to be perfect for all of them. They get the scene done in only two takes plus some set-ups. Richter, ecstatic, lets all of them go for the day, leaving Emma feeling a little smug. Of course I\u2019ve witnessed her acting ability firsthand, but observing from the sidelines is different. Filming a scene, you pay the most attention to your own performance; everyone else\u2019s performance is secondary. Today, I had nothing to do but watch her.</p><p>In the car back to the hotel, I raise the privacy glass between us and the driver, settle her legs across my lap carefully, stroke my fingers over her knee, teasing under the edge of her skirt. Her eyes are heavy as she waits for what I\u2019ll do next. \u201cYou\u2019re a natural, you know,\u201d I say. Her brows rise and she colors deeply. I laugh, squeezing her leg lightly and kissing along her jaw. \u201cA natural at that, too, and I\u2019ll convince you of it soon. But I mean\u2014you\u2019re a natural on film.\u201d</p> <p>She scowls and I run my finger over the spot between her eyebrows. \u201cDon\u2019t do that, you\u2019ll get a frown crease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean\u2014\u2018natural on film\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Why this observation would insult her is beyond me. \u201cYour stepmother told me you\u2019d wanted to do theatre at one time, not film. I can relate\u2014I did some community theatre when I was a preteen. It was fun. But we\u2019re both naturals on film, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201d The scowl increases at mention of her stepmother. I\u2019ll have to remember not to bring her up again.</p><p>\u201cI did want to do theatre; I do want to do theatre. But if it has to be film, I\u2019d prefer something more serious than, you know, what we\u2019re doing now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSerious, like, limited run, indie stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, exactly.\u201d</p> <p>Except in extremely rare cases, independent films make little to no money, and hardly anyone sees them. They\u2019re the film version of literary fiction. \u201cWhy would you want that, when you can do something that will be wide-released into hundreds of theaters across the country and across the world, will make you crazy famous, sell a ton of DVDs in a few months, and when all is said and done will earn you a ton of money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, crazy famous and disgustingly rich is worth more than doing something that might have a social impact or garner critical acclaim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re doing porn.\u201d She blanches and I laugh. Oops. \u201cGod, you should see your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, I\u2019m a riot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I get what you\u2019re saying, I\u2019m just happy doing what I\u2019m doing, that\u2019s all.\u201d I pull her closer and kiss her. She hesitates for a moment and then sighs, kissing me back. My hand inches up her thigh under the skirt until my fingers graze her hip.</p><p>The car comes to a stop in front of the hotel and Emma scrambles to pull herself out of my arms before the door opens. Bob and Jeff are waiting, as are a few photographers and fans. I wave and smile, giving her the chance to smooth her skirt back over her legs. I tuck her arm through mine as we walk into the hotel, people calling, \u201cReid! Emma! We love you!\u201d</p><p>Independent films my ass. Who wouldn\u2019t want this?</p><p>Emma</p> <p>I\u2019ve sort of neglected studying for the SAT until tonight, when Emily mentions it right after she tells me the latest rumors\u2014about myself.</p><p>We agreed a couple of weeks ago that Emily will check fansites and inform me on a need-to-know basis only. Before she took over researching the dirt about me, I occasionally read through it. Bad. Idea. For instance, some fansite declared that I\u2019m the most unattractive star in Hollywood and I have no right dating someone as \u201chot and delicious\u201d as Reid.</p><p>Definitely not need-to-know. Emily is my first line of defense.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a photo of you and Graham running... And several sites are arguing whether or not he\u2019s coming between you and Reid. One suggested that you guys go for runs right after you roll out of bed... together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, great. So now I\u2019m sleeping with two guys. What, they couldn\u2019t get a photo of me and Quinton? Or hey, how about me and Brooke? I mean who cares what\u2019s true or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get that SAT prep book I suggested?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m thrown by the sudden change of subject. \u201cI got it, but I really haven\u2019t had time to go through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma, I know in your world the SAT doesn\u2019t seem like a major deal, but it can determine where you go to college. You should already be halfway through the guide by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s important, but I\u2019ve been really busy...\u201d (My world? What does that mean?)</p><p>\u201cBusy making out with Reid Alexander, hanging out all day and every night with all the other celebrities, you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily, really?\u201d I think I\u2019ll wait to tell her about the increased makeouts... and the fact that I think I\u2019m almost ready to sleep with him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always complaining about being busy, but you\u2019re all over Austin\u2014shopping here, drinking and partying there, visiting Reid a dozen times while he was in the hospital\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI visited him twice, not including that first night, besides which, what is your deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is my deal? We haven\u2019t talked about my problems with Derek at all, and you aren\u2019t here to help me find a dress for homecoming, which by the way is like four days away and I\u2019m royally stressing over it; all we ever talk about is you and your issues with this hot guy and that hot guy and it\u2019s like I don\u2019t have a best friend at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily, if you want to talk about something just talk about it, and it\u2019s not like I can just drop my life because you need a dress\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t even bought a dress since I was ten or twelve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got one for Grant\u2019s graduation from Penn State! That was like two years ago!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever!\u201d she huffs, cutting me off. \u201cThat\u2019s not even important!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is important? Emily, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d do this to me right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t believe I\u2019d do this to you? Classic. Because you\u2019re the one who needs the attention, right? And I\u2019m the one who gives the attention. You\u2019re the one with the spotlight, and I\u2019m the one to the side. And who gives a shit about my problems? Clearly not you. You know what? Nevermind. I don\u2019t need your help or your support, I have Mom.\u201d The line clicks, and she\u2019s gone.</p><p>I sit on the bed in my hotel room, staring at the phone in my hand, my breath coming thin and shallow, tears welling up and spilling over. There are too many things to feel at once, and all of them are bad. I\u2019m an attention whore, and she doesn\u2019t need me? She has a mom, and I don\u2019t? Is that what she actually meant to say? I feel my heart pounding, hard and fast, hear it echoing in my ears. My face feels hot and I think I might be sick.</p><p>And then all I can think is: did Emily just break up with me?</p><p>Several sleepless hours later, I don\u2019t mention my fight with Emily to Graham during our run, though he notices something is wrong not long after we start out.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Em?\u201d This is the only time he\u2019s ever called me by the nickname Emily and I have called each other since we were five, and it\u2019s all the push my emotions need. My eyes water and I dash tears away, mumbling some excuse about pollen counts and allergic reactions.</p><p>I\u2019ve never had allergies a day in my life, but this week I appear to have the worst case ever. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s buying it, and after a couple of days, I text him that I should probably avoid the pollen and take a break from running. He texts back, asking if there is anything he can do. All I can say is no. Which is utterly true.</p><p>I alternate between wanting Emily to see nothing but pictures of me smiling and having a good time plastered all over her damned browser, and not wanting her to see photos of me at all because it would justify what she said. While everyone else goes out to unwind after long days of filming, I stay in and order room service, study the prep book, work the practice tests, and blame the SAT and fictitious allergies for my reclusive behavior and constant sniffling. Brooke offers her prescription allergy meds while Meredith pushes the holistic cures her homeopathic doctor recommends.</p><p>Emily\u2019s homecoming comes and goes, and she never calls.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if she found a dress, or if Derek convinces her he doesn\u2019t want her to change who she is, or if she misses me at all.</p><p>I\u2019m spending an hour every morning pressing ice cold rags to my eyes, trying to get the swelling down from crying myself to sleep.</p><p>I\u2019m equal parts broken and mad as fuck.</p><p>Emily would know what mad as fuck is.</p><p>Chapter 36</p><p>REID</p><p>I\u2019m supposed to start filming tomorrow, though my doctor and production are only allowing a few hours per day. I\u2019m ready to get back to it, and it\u2019s beyond frustrating. \u201cHalf a day is better than no day,\u201d Richter tells me. \u201cI\u2019m happy I can use you at all.\u201d</p><p>Emma sits next to me, translating a passage from a French novel. Or I think she is, until she says, \u201cEww. Did you just... kill that thing... with a skillet?\u201d</p><p>I bury an ax in the shoulder of the next zombie and lop off an arm. \u201cDamned... undead.\u201d I meant to nail him in the head. \u201cTechnically, you know...\u201d I sever the next zombie\u2019s head from its body with the ax and she makes another disgusted sound, \u201c...it was a frying pan.\u201d I glance at her again, laughing at the revolted look on her face\u2014one side of her upper lip raised like a sneer. Pausing the game, I lean into her line of vision. \u201cI have to be ready to protect you, since you suck so bad at killing zombies.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She rolls her eyes and I kiss her, pushing her book off of her lap and ignoring her feeble protests. I slide an arm around her. \u201cMakeout break.\u201d That\u2019s all the warning she gets.</p><p>I press her back into the pillows, following her carefully, because stretching at the wrong angle still hurts like hell. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay to... you know...\u201d she says.</p><p>Leaning above her, I smile. \u201cTo what? Kiss and touch you until you throw me down and have your way with me? Yes, I\u2019m plenty up to that.\u201d</p><p>She sighs and laughs, and I figure at this point we don\u2019t need to talk anymore.</p> <p>One thing that doesn\u2019t happen often is finding myself alone with Graham Douglas. Most people are fairly uncomplicated, once you know their motivations. I was certain one of his was Brooke. But even though he stays near her, he watches Emma as well. I\u2019d be stupid not to notice. And I\u2019m not stupid.</p><p>At the moment, he and I are standing next to each other, waiting to film the only scene featuring just the two of us in the entire movie. I\u2019m wondering if he\u2019s doing Brooke, if he has plans to try with Emma as well.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d His expression is relaxed, but tension runs between us like a taut wire. I wonder whether plucking it would disclose where we stand more clearly.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I nod. \u201cEmma says I should thank you for summoning the doctor the other night. I was too out of it to be aware of anything.\u201d</p><p>He half-shrugs. \u201cYeah, I noticed. Glad I could help.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m trying to find the condescension I expect from someone who hangs out with Brooke and might have plans to bang the girl I intend to hook up with, but I can\u2019t find it. Either he\u2019s really good at hiding it, or it\u2019s not there. The PA calls us to our places.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d he says.</p><p>Emma</p><p>I\u2019m running with Graham this morning for the first time in a week, and he hasn\u2019t mentioned my allergy Armageddon. We\u2019ve discussed auditions at Julliard and studio placement at NYU, but there\u2019s something unsaid under the college talk, and I wait for him to sort out whatever\u2019s weighing on his mind. He pretends not to notice the one time I say \u201chuh,\u201d which seems like a clue. Like he\u2019s afraid to upset me.</p><p>\u201cSo, is everything okay with you and Reid?\u201d he finally asks as we hit our turnaround point.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s definitely feeling better.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s quiet for a moment. \u201cUm... I mean between the two of you... is everything okay.\u201d</p><p>I blink up at him and realize from the way he isn\u2019t looking at me that he\u2019s uncomfortable asking this question, that this is the thing he\u2019s been withholding for twenty minutes. I think about what Reid and I have been doing lately and feel a trace of guilt, even though what Reid and I do is no more his business than what he and Brooke do is mine. \u201cUm, yeah, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay. Good. I\u2019m not trying to pry\u2014I just wanted to make sure. You know, that you\u2019re okay. And you know you can talk to me, if you need to talk, vent, whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say. \u201cThanks.\u201d I can\u2019t imagine talking to Graham about Reid.</p><p>Our kiss on my bed has never been mentioned, or repeated, or even nearly repeated. It\u2019s as though it never happened at all. I wish I could forget it as easily as he\u2019s been able to, and most of the time the memory of it is neatly filed away\u2014zip, zip, gone\u2014but every so often I think about it and God.</p><p>We\u2019ve also never talked about Reid kissing me in front of hidden-camera-wielding, photo-uploading Reid Alexander fans. So I have no idea if the reason Graham withdrew was because I kissed Reid the next day, or because of Brooke, or because kissing me simply didn\u2019t do anything for him. I guess in the end it doesn\u2019t matter which reason it was.</p><p>I consider asking for his advice concerning my fight with Emily, but just thinking about her makes me tear up, and I\u2019m determined not to start crying again while I\u2019m out in public. So I don\u2019t say anything. And after a few minutes, he mentions something about filming tomorrow and the moment is past.</p> <p>Today is the one week anniversary of our fight. Emily and I have never gone more than three days without talking or texting each other, usually not twenty-four hours. I\u2019ve begun texts and emails to her at least fifty times, I\u2019ve clicked her speed dial number and almost hit talk, but I don\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>How do you apologize for living your life?</p><p>Reid started short stints of filming this week, though his doctor limited him to three hours per day max. The problem is, there are a lot more hours remaining in his day, and not a lot to fill them. I have several hours of filming daily, plus class work, plus studying for the SAT. By Sunday afternoon, I\u2019m playing catch-up before beginning another week of filming.</p><p>\u201cTell me again why you\u2019re taking the SAT?\u201d He stretches, pauses the game and reaches for me.</p><p>\u201cCollege?\u201d I shove the math prep book off of my lap as he kisses me. We\u2019re sitting in the middle of his bed, remnants of our room-service lunches on trays at the foot of the bed, game controllers and study implements surrounding us.</p><p>He takes the pencil from my hand and tosses it onto his bedside table, his brow furrowed. \u201cYeah, but, why?\u201d</p><p>Meredith and Brooke asked the same question, with the same perplexed look. Our kind tends not to pursue higher education. What reason is there, when our career paths are right in front of us, and time off would result in forfeited film roles and lost momentum? Both of them dismissed Jenna as some sort of oddity because of her academic family.</p><p>Is it enough to say that it\u2019s what normal people do? (Probably not, because all of them would ask me why I\u2019d want to be normal.)</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Reid. I just want to go, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m just curious. Seems like a lot of work.\u201d He pulls me onto his lap.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d I say, uneasy, but he only shrugs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. My doctor said I\u2019ll be able to start some light workouts with my trainer next week.\u201d He tips my chin back to kiss my neck. One arm supports me as the other unbuttons the top buttons of my shirt, his mouth following his fingers. Nudging the fabric aside, he runs his tongue over the upper curve of my breast, and I close my eyes and try to breathe.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, his shirt is off, mine is completely unbuttoned and I\u2019m straddling him. He runs his hands up and down my back before nudging the straps of my bra off of my shoulders. \u201cGod, Emma, you\u2019re so hot. I can\u2019t take this anymore.\u201d His kisses my shoulder, moving towards my throat. \u201cDo you want me to beg? I\u2019m begging. Jesus Christ, you\u2019re killing me with wanting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your incision,\u201d I say, gasping at what his mouth is doing\u2014soft little sucking bites along the curve of my neck.</p><p>\u201cFuck the incision, I\u2019d gladly go back in and have it sewn up again. I want you, and I don\u2019t care about anything else.\u201d He pulls me tight and kisses me, almost too fiercely.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d I\u2019m caving\u2014oh, boy am I caving. My brain casts around for an excuse. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to meet Meredith in half an hour to do econ homework, and after that everyone is going out...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight, then.\u201d His tone is resolute, his hands gripping my hips. \u201cAfter we come back from whatever we\u2019re doing, and everyone is safe in their rooms, I want you, back here, in my bed.\u201d He stares into my eyes. \u201cSay yes, Emma. Please.\u201d</p><p>I tell myself that I\u2019m only scared because I\u2019ve never done it. Maybe once it\u2019s over it won\u2019t feel like such a big deal. \u201cYes,\u201d I answer in the smallest possible voice.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d he says, kissing my now-bruised lips more softly, and a thrill runs through me at his words. And then I want to run to my room and hide in the closet. I knew this was coming, we were getting closer every day, but suddenly it\u2019s here and I\u2019m petrified.</p><p>He laughs softly. \u201cI can wait. What\u2019s another\u2014\u201d he looks at his watch \u201c\u2014four or five hours.\u201d</p><p>Every time I think about tonight I break out in a cold sweat, so any distraction is good, even homework. Meredith and I spend an hour on economics (\u201cI fail to see why I will ever need to know this stuff,\u201d she says) before we give up and decide that supply and demand can wait. We have to dress for a cast field trip to a new dance club.</p><p>\u201cReid\u2019s looking restored to almost full health.\u201d She gathers her hair up at the crown and lets it fall, draws it up and lets it fall again. \u201cWhat do you think\u2014up or down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like up. It\u2019s different for you.\u201d I don\u2019t reply to her comment about Reid, though thanks to that my hands are shaking just enough to make applying mascara dangerous.</p><p>\u201cI agree. Up. Robby likes it down, so whenever we go out I don\u2019t get to put it up.\u201d</p><p>I stand there watching her in the mirror, holding the mascara wand aloft like I\u2019m about to conduct with it. \u201cRobby likes it down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah... um, we got back together last night.\u201d She smiles mischievously, examining her own reflection. \u201cHe\u2019s coming down this weekend.\u201d</p><p>I barely manage to keep from blurting What the hell are you thinking? \u201cSo he\u2019s going to be less possessive, and stop accusing you of stuff you aren\u2019t doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe promises to trust me more.\u201d She begins to pin locks of her hair up. \u201cHe knows he was being jealous for no reason before. He\u2019s going to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t he said that before?\u201d Somehow she missed my cynical tone.</p><p>\u201cI really think he means it this time,\u201d she says, utterly blissful and trusting.</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s put yours up, too. Turn around.\u201d</p><p>I turn away from her, away from the mirror. It\u2019s better for both of us if she doesn\u2019t see the incredulity on my face.</p><p>Chapter 37</p><p>REID</p><p>John: theres some shit going around about that emma chick, that shes doing both you and that graham guy</p><p>Reid: Meh. Those sites are jacked up.</p><p>John: yeah ok but there are photos of them together. not just one or two but it looks like they run together all the time did you know about that?</p><p>Reid: wtf \u2013 when???</p><p>John: this one site has hotel employees saying that they come downstairs together pretty much every morning. like theyre screwing then running. i don\u2019t know man i just thought youd wanna know.</p><p>Reid: k thx</p><p>I usually avoid the tabloid sites like a disease. All of us do, as much as we can. Most of the time, it\u2019s fabricated by some fucktard \u201cjournalist\u201d who just wants to sell a story and doesn\u2019t give a shit if it\u2019s true.</p><p>The hitch in ignoring this crap comes when there\u2019s photographic evidence. Not that this can\u2019t be deceptive, too; photo alteration software can be a horrific tool in the wrong hands. But there\u2019s nothing fake about the multiple photos of Graham and Emma running, stretching, talking, laughing. Their clothing varies, so it wasn\u2019t a one-time thing. This is something they\u2019ve been doing or were doing regularly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bob manages one of his bait-and-switch routines tonight to prevent paparazzi obstruction, sending one of his less beefy cohorts\u2014wearing one of my caps\u2014out the front door with the others, while Emma and I escape straight into a waiting SUV out back.</p><p>As we\u2019re pulling away from the hotel, I ask, \u201cSo, how long have you been running with Graham?\u201d My tone is as nonchalant as I can manage. I am not used to this jealousy crap. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m trusting. It\u2019s that usually, I don\u2019t give a shit.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d she says, caught off guard.</p><p>\u201cRunning. With Graham. How long?\u201d I repeat the question one phrase at a time, my fingers stroking the back of her neck.</p> <p>\u201cUm, sort of on and off since we\u2019ve been here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince we\u2019ve been here in Austin?\u201d I tip my head to the side. \u201cWere you two already acquainted?\u201d</p><p>The expression on her face changes. She knows where this is coming from now. She knows about the photos online. She\u2019s unused to everything she does being scrutinized so closely. She clears her throat and swallows. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you just started running together when we got to Austin, even though you\u2019ve never met before, and don\u2019t know each other at all.\u201d I\u2019m trying to sound merely curious. Fail.</p><p>\u201cWe both run early, and we ran into each other one time that first week, and the time goes more quickly to go with someone else...\u201d she trails off.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good-looking guy,\u201d I say, watching her reaction.</p><p>\u201cGraham? Uh, I guess so.\u201d Her tone says, Oh really? I hadn\u2019t noticed. Her eyes, widening slightly, says she definitely has.</p><p>I smile. Might as well lay it all out there. \u201cWhat\u2019s weird is that some of the fansites are posting pictures of you guys together. Saying you\u2019re sleeping together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She\u2019s good. I almost can\u2019t tell that she already knows this.</p><p>\u201cWeird, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s insane. We\u2019re just exercising together, and that\u2019s all.\u201d I can hear both truth and lie in her words, and I\u2019m not sure what to make of it.</p> <p>\u201cOkay. I was just checking.\u201d I tug her closer and leave off the cross-examination, stroke my fingers along the side of her neck and kiss her. I\u2019m not letting anything screw up tonight.</p><p>Emma</p><p>Reid seems to forget what he brought up in the car, but I can\u2019t look at Graham without recalling every word. It\u2019s true, I haven\u2019t been forthcoming about running with Graham every morning, but I didn\u2019t think I needed to account for every waking moment. Reid never struck me as that type, and frankly that sort of expectation would alarm me, especially after the Meredith/Robby drama.</p><p>The kiss Graham and I shared was weeks ago. I shouldn\u2019t feel guilty, but I do. There can only be one reason for that. I still feel it. It still means something to me, even if it shouldn\u2019t. Walking into the club with Reid holding my hand, I\u2019m determined to forget it. I can\u2019t take that kiss, and these feelings, into what Reid and I will do tonight.</p><p>Production wants nothing happening to Reid that could cause a relapse. The bodyguards are sticking close, keeping him separated from non-cast people. The fans and photogs are forced to content themselves with drooling over him from afar. Every now and then someone talks her way past security and is escorted close enough to salivate over him at close range.</p><p>He dances with me a couple of times, pulling me full against him, swaying so slowly that we\u2019re hardly moving. Mostly, though, he leans against the bar drinking, talking with other cast members and the occasional favored fan, and watching me dance. Every time our eyes meet, his look is pure fire, reminding me of our later plans.</p><p>I\u2019m dancing with Tadd when I glance up to see Reid talking to Graham, who\u2019s spent most of the evening at the bar in conversation with Brooke. At first, I don\u2019t think anything about it, but then Reid gestures towards the dance floor, and though he doesn\u2019t look towards me, my instincts say this exchange has something to do with me. Uh-oh. As the song ends and another starts up, I see that Brooke is at Graham\u2019s side and all three of them are talking, and while they all appear under control, the antagonism between them is visible.</p><p>I wonder what\u2019s being said, and how it will affect my relationships with either of them. Something is about to change, I can feel it, and I realize with blinding certainty that despite what I was thinking when we entered this place, I do not want to lose Graham\u2019s friendship. I don\u2019t want Reid to do anything to end it. Oh, my God.</p> <p>I have no idea what to do. As I\u2019ve done for more than half my life in times like this, I reach for my phone and start to dial Emily\u2019s number, faltering when I recognize what my mental autopilot is making me do. Suddenly I\u2019m overwhelmed with indecision and grief. As a new song begins, I leave Tadd talking to one of the extras and bolt for the bathroom. Bob points me towards a secluded VIP lounge.</p><p>I\u2019m alone for the space of about fifteen seconds.</p><p>\u201cReid is following me,\u201d Brooke says as she enters. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to avoid him, you\u2019d better hide.\u201d</p><p>Darting into one of three stalls, I click the stainless steel door shut behind me, put the toilet lid down, sit and pull my feet up. Before I can ask myself what I\u2019m doing skulking around a bathroom stall like I\u2019m in a bad spy movie, Reid enters. \u201cAnyone else in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answers. \u201cWhat, you wanna check the stalls? Be my guest.\u201d I hold my breath, but she knows him well and he takes her challenge as confirmation.</p><p>\u201cJust answer one question. Tell me the truth, if you can. Does Graham know?\u201d</p><p>Through the quarter-inch strip of space between the door and the frame, I watch her remove her lip gloss from her bag and apply it carefully. After a cursory glance over the door behind which I sit motionless and mute, she studies him in the mirror before answering. \u201cYes, he knows.\u201d</p><p>He makes a sound of irritation. \u201cGod, I knew it. Why would you tell him. Why?\u201d</p><p>She throws the tube of lip gloss back into the bag and turns to face him. \u201cGraham was in the movie I had to break contract on because I was pregnant. When you didn\u2019t give a shit and my parents and my agent were pressuring me about \u2018the right thing to do,\u2019 he knocked on my trailer door and found me sobbing. So I told him. And he told me to do what was best for me. He was the only person I knew, and I barely knew him at all, who cared about what I needed.\u201d</p><p>My blood is pumping so furiously that I can barely hear.</p><p>\u201cNo one forced you to have that baby, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018That baby,\u2019\u201d she says, her voice breaking, \u201cwas your baby, you asshole. When I told you, I thought\u2014\u201d she stops. \u201cWell. No one cares what I thought. All that matters are the facts. You wanted nothing from me but sex. You said whatever you had to say to get it. I was a na\u00efve little girl, and I got stuck with the consequences.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not breathing, and it\u2019s just as well because it feels as though there\u2019s no air left in the room. \u201cYou have no idea what I wanted,\u201d he says, so quietly I could barely hear him. \u201cIf you\u2019d had an abortion like your parents wanted you to, there wouldn\u2019t have been consequences. It was your choice. Your choice to derail your career, your choice to fuck up both of our lives if the public ever finds out.\u201d</p><p>She stares at him. \u201cHow dare you act like it was oh-so-simple. Flip a coin. Throw a dart. It wasn\u2019t that goddamned easy. You know what, Reid? My decision did sidetrack up my career, but I made the right fucking decision for me. And I\u2019ll take my life over your miserable egocentric I am God existence any day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiserable? Hardly. Egocentric? Okay. I can live with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet. Out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing. No problem.\u201d The bathroom door wooshes open and shut behind him.</p><p>I can\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d she says, and I unwind my legs and open the door.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs, blotting excess gloss from her lips. \u201cJoin the club. What is there to say, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did it happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree years ago. I was sixteen. Three years ago today, in fact, which was also the last time I saw him.\u201d She grabs a paper towel and presses it into the corner of each eye. \u201cReid doesn\u2019t even know his birth date. He never asked. God dammit. I was fine all day. I thought I could handle it this year. Guess that was wrong.\u201d</p><p>Our eyes meet in the mirror, and I think of how young she is, how much more so she was three years ago. How scared she must have been. \u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust ask Bob to get me a car? I just want to get out of here. I\u2019ll be fine tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. No problem.\u201d I start for the door.</p><p>\u201cEmma...\u201d I stop, turn with my hand on the door handle. \u201cDon\u2019t go in blind. Whatever he\u2019s saying to you, he\u2019s saying to get what he wants. If that\u2019s all you want, too, then more power to you. Just don\u2019t fall in love with him.\u201d</p><p>I find Bob, who assures me he\u2019ll get Brooke back to the hotel. Her request accomplished, my head is crammed with impulses and empty of solutions. Sneaking along the wall, I merge into the crowd, reluctant to confront Reid, who absolved himself of responsibility or even emotion over getting someone pregnant.</p><p>I want Emily. My eyes fill with tears and I head for the exit, missing her, needing her advice, the way she centers me. For as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve thought of her as permanent, but she wasn\u2019t. She\u2019s detached herself from me, and she\u2019s gone, just like everyone else I\u2019ve ever loved.</p><p>Chapter 38</p><p>REID</p><p>I can\u2019t fucking believe this night.</p><p>First, the text from John\u2014the rumors online concerning Emma, Graham and myself. Since I don\u2019t usually do exclusive relationships, the speculation about Emma has been crazed since it became apparent that I was more interested in her than my usual catch-and-release pattern. If the tabloids can\u2019t get confirmation of a relationship, they invent it. And then they try to dig up any evidence of infidelity they can find.</p><p>I do not let this shit get to me. I don\u2019t. But this is the first time since Brooke that I\u2019ve been in this position\u2014in a relationship of sorts with someone who might be screwing around.</p><p>I\u2019d just danced with Emma and turned her over to Tadd, who\u2019s in better shape to dance at the moment. Chatting distractedly with some of the minor characters and a few of the extras who found out where we were going tonight, I watched her dance, the way she moved, the way she looked over every few minutes to see if I was still watching her. Her shy smile when she saw that I was. Everything was on track for this night to be mind-blowing.</p><p>Brooke was a bit wasted, sitting at the bar a few feet away, with Graham. I ignored her. Until.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me\u2014Mr. Alexander?\u201d the bartender said behind me.</p><p>I turned. \u201cYeah?\u201d He handed me a screwdriver, which I definitely hadn\u2019t ordered. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>He pointed at Brooke, who blew me a kiss. Undeniably wasted. I picked up the drink, walked the few steps to her. \u201cUm, thanks? But I think you\u2019d enjoy this more than I would.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her expression turned almost pouty. \u201cYou liked them at one time.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes, wondering at her game. Graham sat silently on the other side of her, staring into his drink, his lips pursed. \u201cOh? When was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be surprised that you don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>Oh, I remember all right. Not long before our breakup, Brooke smuggled a bottle of vodka into my house in her bag. \u201cLet\u2019s get some OJ and make screwdrivers,\u201d she whispered. I made a show of making popcorn in the microwave while she grabbed two large plastic cups and half-filled them with orange juice and ice cubes, and we told my parents we were going to watch a movie in the media room as we disappeared into my wing of the house.</p> <p>An hour later, we were completely hammered, giggling and all over each other. We\u2019d been aware of little but each other that night, and we were reckless in every possible way. Why she\u2019d want to remind me of that night\u2014with Graham right next to her\u2014was incomprehensible.</p><p>\u201cIs there some reason you expect me to remember drinking screwdrivers with you, Brooke?\u201d</p><p>She stared, while under the surface, both of us popped and snapped with tension. She was a live wire, dangerous and unstable, and some presentiment pushed forward, telling me to beware. In a flash of idiocy, I discounted it. \u201cOnly because of what came from it,\u201d she answered.</p><p>That\u2019s the point my eyes flicked over to catch Graham closing his eyes, breathing out a sigh. He turned, his hand on her forearm. \u201cBrooke. Let\u2019s go back to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want him to remember. Just tonight. Just once.\u201d That was when I knew she\u2019d told him.</p> <p>I leaned towards her. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying you know exactly when? Please. I doubt you really even know exactly who.\u201d</p><p>She slipped off the barstool, fists clenched, livid and not as sloppy drunk as I\u2019d assumed. \u201cYou bastard\u2014\u201d</p><p>Graham stepped in front of her. \u201cThat\u2019s uncalled for,\u201d he said to me, his hand on her, keeping her just behind him, as though I\u2019d hurt her if I was too close.</p><p>All of us spoke quietly, hyper aware of the fact that we were in public. Even still, I was pissed at the condescension in his tone. \u201cThis is none of your goddamned business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs her friend, I\u2019m making it my business. Just back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriend? Right. Does Brooke know you\u2019ve been running in the mornings with Emma, and who knows what else? That you\u2019re trying to have your cake and eat it, too?\u201d The way I said this left no doubt as to my meaning. \u201cAt least I\u2019m only after one girl.\u201d I gestured towards the dance floor.</p> <p>Graham glanced in that direction. \u201cI will kick your ass if you hurt Emma. Don\u2019t think for one second that I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Okay. Confusing, right in front of Brooke. \u201cMy relationship with Emma is definitely none of your business.\u201d</p><p>At that, Brooke took off for the lounge. I threw back the tequila shot the bartender had lined up at my spot and went after her. Graham followed me, but I didn\u2019t give a shit. I had to know if she\u2019d told him, though I knew she had. Our conversation in the bathroom confirmed it. When I shoved the door open minutes later, he was standing just outside the door, his jaw clenched. I saluted him and walked straight back to the bar, scanning the floor for Emma.</p><p>Emma</p><p>I have no idea how I manage to get out of the club and hail a taxi without being stopped by anyone, but I do. As I reach for the door handle, Graham is there, opening the door for me.</p><p>\u201cEmma? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, wiping the tears off of my face.</p><p>\u201cGet in,\u201d he says gruffly, and I obey, folding myself into the back seat and scooting across when it becomes clear he\u2019s getting in with me. My face hurts from trying to prevent myself from sobbing, and I turn towards the window as he gives the driver the hotel name.</p> <p>We don\u2019t say another word during the drive back, though he takes my hand, pulls me into his arms while I cry. My mind is pure chaos. I\u2019ve just left Reid with no explanation, not even a goodbye, and I can\u2019t imagine what I\u2019m going to say to him. Can I do what Brooke suggested, and just use him the way she thinks he wants to use me? Hardly. I picture Emily telling me that using Reid Alexander to lose my virginity would be the most mind-blowing way I could possibly lose it.</p><p>At least I\u2019m not in love with him. My disillusionment over the not-so-perfect Reid Alexander is the finishing touch to a miserable week. Disappointed and shocked? Definitely. Broken-hearted? No.</p><p>The loss of him can\u2019t compare to how much it hurts to have lost my best friend. I close my eyes as fresh tears course down my face and drip from my chin. I can\u2019t bear the way I miss her. Like a missing limb. Like the quiet voice of conscience. Like hunger.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d Graham says as we pull up to the curb and he pays the driver. \u201cStay close.\u201d I wonder about his directive for two seconds, and then the flashes start. He draws me close and swiftly heads for the door as a couple of security people rush out to usher us inside. The stories tomorrow should be fascinating. Luckily, I don\u2019t care.</p><p>When we get upstairs, he glances at Brooke\u2019s door as we pass it, and I know that\u2019s where he wants to be. I hope she realizes what she\u2019s got. He\u2019s nothing like Reid. I can\u2019t believe I ever thought to compare them.</p><p>Shoving the key card into the door, I say, \u201cThank you. Go... take care of her. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d His concern is so sweet it almost hurts.</p><p>I nod, and he takes my chin in his hand and examines my face. I close my eyes, knowing I must be a total mess. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay, Emma. You\u2019re stronger than you know.\u201d His voice is soft but sure, and I nod again. He kisses my forehead gently and turns away.</p><p>My phone buzzes as soon as I get into my room. When I check the screen, there are two missed calls and four messages, all from Reid. I slump onto the bed and scroll through them.</p><p>Reid: Where are you? Are you still here somewhere?</p><p>Reid: missed call</p><p>Reid: missed call</p><p>Reid: Seriously, you disappear and then don\u2019t answer? I\u2019m worried, call me back.</p><p>Reid: Jenna said she saw you talking to brooke. Gonna ask my side or just listen to her?</p><p>Reid: K. I get it. Call me back in 5 or i have to assume we\u2019re over.</p><p>It\u2019s been two minutes since the last text. I lie on the bed and watch the clock tick away the final three minutes of his ultimatum, and then turn onto my back.</p><p>I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s absurd to reject what might be a fantasy for every other girl in the world\u2014losing my virginity with someone like Reid Alexander. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s old-fashioned to hold out for losing it with someone who matters. Maybe once that someone breaks my heart, I won\u2019t give a crap who I sleep with. Maybe I\u2019ll look back on this moment and think I was the biggest moron in the state of Texas.</p><p>My God, Emily would kill me.</p><p>Chapter 39</p><p>REID</p><p>No answer. Awesome. Fucking awesome.</p><p>I feel as though I could electrocute someone with a single high-voltage touch. For me, anger is something I release in short bursts, to lessen it before the rest is swallowed. I learned that living with my patronizing father. I never let myself get this furious, because I can\u2019t hide it. If I can\u2019t hide it, I\u2019m vulnerable.</p><p>I throw back another tequila shot at the bar\u2014the bartender quirks an eyebrow because the stuff I\u2019m throwing back is old and expensive and meant to be sipped, respected. It might as well be shots of the cheapest shit available for how I\u2019m ingesting it. Just then, a hand falls on my shoulder and I turn, too quickly, and nearly knock a girl down.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d she says, stumbling back on her stilettos.</p><p>I grab her before she falls, one arm encircling her waist and the other catching her wrist. \u201cOh,\u201d she says again, hands on my chest. She\u2019s pretty, in that dark hair, big eyes, trying a little too hard with the makeup sort of way. I recognize her from the set.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of the extras.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She\u2019s breathless, her eyes dilated\u2014though from alcohol, club drugs or the fact that my arm is wrapped around her, I can\u2019t tell.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlossom?\u201d She says her name like a question, as though if it isn\u2019t good enough for me, she\u2019s willing to change it. I press my lips together. Smile down at her.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to dance, Blossom? I can\u2019t do anything strenuous, since I\u2019m still recovering from surgery...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Slow works for me.\u201d Her breath is coming in little gasps. After trying to seduce Emma for the past several weeks, I forgot how easy it usually is.</p><p>\u201cDoes it now,\u201d I say.</p><p>She smiles a wicked little smile as I lead her onto the floor, and it isn\u2019t long before I\u2019m whispering in her ear, drawing out her acquiescence to go back to the hotel, as effortless as it ever was.</p><p>Emma</p><p>After a restless night, I send Graham a text saying I\u2019m not running this morning. He\u2019s probably still with Brooke anyway. I ignore the prickly twinge that thought causes.</p><p>I know I can\u2019t avoid filming, though I seriously consider faking laryngitis. Or a killer migraine. Or a heart attack. The whole day\u2014the rest of the week\u2014will be full of scenes with Reid. I wonder what his explanation will be. I wonder if I\u2019ll accept it, if I can believe that what happened between him and Brooke was immaturity and not callousness.</p><p>\u201cEmma, what happened last night?\u201d Meredith asks in the car on the way to the Bingley house location. The others have already left, so it\u2019s just the two of us. \u201cI looked up and you were gone, Brooke was gone, Graham was gone... and then when Reid came back to the hotel with one of the extras. I thought you guys were going out, or hooking up?\u201d I feel my mouth hanging open, but I can\u2019t seem to snap it closed. \u201cOh God,\u201d she says. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know. Oh shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, blinking. He brought a girl back to his room? Last night? \u201cNo, we, uh, it\u2019s okay. We\u2019re... over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. That was quick.\u201d</p><p>She could say that again.</p><p>\u201cJeez, they don\u2019t waste any time. Look at this,\u201d she says, holding out her phone. One of the fansites is on the screen, and suddenly here in my hand are surprisingly clear photos of Reid and some girl getting cozy at the club, climbing into a taxi together, exiting at the hotel, his arm slung around her shoulder, his mouth near her ear. There are also photos of Graham and me going into the hotel, my face hidden by his arm.</p><p>The theories are all over the place, from almost rational: Reid and I had a fight over Graham, or over Reid\u2019s New Girl, to mind-boggling: the whole thing is a ploy to throw the public off the truth\u2014that I\u2019m actually pregnant with Reid\u2019s baby, or is it Graham\u2019s?\u2014cue the close-up of my supposed baby bump (my tummy in this photo looks as though I may have eaten half a slice of bread or missed one freaking day of crunches last week, Jesus H. Christ).</p><p>I hand it back. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m reading any more, certainly not the fan comments. I\u2019m enough of an emotional wreck, thanks. \u201cWhat a load. We just decided... that we didn\u2019t match up so well.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s so weird, I thought things were going well the last time we talked. Are you okay? You\u2019ve seemed kind of depressed lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d I lie.</p><p>While I\u2019m in makeup, I\u2019m doing what I can to get into my character zone so I can face Reid. I\u2019m unsure whether the antagonism of these scenes between Lizbeth and Will is going to be to our benefit or the reverse; how Reid will play it is the only indeterminate factor. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a freaking important factor. We don\u2019t even make eye contact on set until Richter calls, \u201cAction.\u201d</p><p>INT. Bingley house \u2013 Night</p> <p>Bingley party. CHARLOTTE and LIZBETH observe the other guests. WILL approaches them.</p><p>CHARLOTTE</p><p>(aside to LIZBETH)</p><p>Don\u2019t look now, Will is coming this way.</p><p>WILL</p> <p>(to LIZBETH)</p><p>Wanna dance?</p><p>(He\u2019s either perfectly in character or he\u2019s angry over my desertion last night. I might have listened, if he\u2019d have explained, given me a chance to understand. No chance of that now.)</p><p>LIZBETH</p><p>(glancing at CHARLOTTE)</p><p>Sure.</p> <p>Cut to:</p><p>CHARLOTTE shrugs at LIZBETH as WILL leads her to the open space where people are dancing.</p><p>Reid takes my hand and presses into the crowd of minor characters and extras, pulling me behind him. They make room for us as we pass, and we settle into the middle of the floor, Reid\u2019s arms encircling me, holding me as close as he had when we danced last night. When Richter calls, \u201cCut,\u201d his arms drop and he turns from me without a word.</p><p>Someone from makeup runs up to push a lock of my hair behind my ear and spray it in place. Over her shoulder I see Graham in his goofy Bill-wear, which makes him look like an unfashionable dad. He glances up, sees my bemused look and smiles, adjusting his glasses and waggling his eyebrows, coaxing a reluctant smile from me.</p><p>\u201cPlaces everyone,\u201d the assistant director calls, and I turn back to Reid, who\u2019s whispering in the ear of the girl from the paparazzi photos. She scampers back to her scene partner; as I\u2019m watching her, he\u2019s watching me.</p><p>His arms go around me again and mine return to his shoulders. \u201cGood morning, Emma,\u201d he says, his expression glacial. \u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d</p><p>Before I can answer, Richter readies us and calls action. We dance in silence for five minutes as close-ups are shot of the two of us avoiding each other\u2019s eyes. This will undoubtedly be the easiest five minutes of filming with Reid today.</p><p>During the break, Brooke takes my elbow and we move apart from everyone else. \u201cGraham told me you came back to the hotel last night without talking to Reid.\u201d She looks uncomfortable. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect... I mean, your relationship with him isn\u2019t my business.\u201d She\u2019s hesitant and concerned, and I\u2019m struck by the fact that I have no idea who she really is. One thing is clear: the Brooke I thought I knew is a facade. \u201cI know I said not to fall for him. But... maybe that\u2019s just how he was with me. Maybe he\u2019d be different with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I say, glancing at him talking to the extra, Blossom. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says, her gaze direct.</p><p>I shrug and glance away. \u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>The dialogue of the next scene is too close to reality in reverse, the proximity and eye contact made more awkward by the words.</p><p>\u201cAction.\u201d</p><p>WILL and LIZBETH dance.</p><p>LIZBETH</p><p>A few days ago, you told me that your opinions about people can\u2019t be changed.</p><p>WILL</p><p>(curious)</p><p>Yes.</p><p>LIZBETH</p><p>I hope you\u2019re careful when you make up your mind about people, then? That you\u2019re never so close-minded that you\u2019re prejudiced from the start.</p><p>WILL</p><p>I hope not. Why?</p><p>LIZBETH</p><p>I\u2019m just trying to figure you out.</p><p>WILL</p><p>And?</p><p>LIZBETH</p><p>I haven\u2019t.</p><p>This is the point where the song on the soundtrack will end, and we stand looking at each other for ten seconds. His eyes are cold, and the chill between us twists in the pit of my stomach. It\u2019s all I can do to keep from shivering. Ten seconds can be a very long time. It feels like an hour before Richter calls, \u201cCut!\u201d and we turn and walk in opposite directions.</p><p>Filming breaks are like coming up for air after being under water for a few seconds too long, but breaks are their own sort of misery. Everything we do is being scrutinized by everyone on set. They all know that last night, whatever was going on between us ended. Unpleasantly. Speculations fly, buzzing near but never landing; no one knows exactly what happened, only that something did, and they probe for clues to what.</p><p>This goddamned day is never going to end.</p><p>Chapter 40</p><p>REID</p><p>The scenes with Emma are the hardest I\u2019ve ever had to film. Would it make any difference if I got her alone, begged her forgiveness and told her that Blossom meant nothing? Does it make any difference that it\u2019s true? I needed a distraction last night to numb the emotion boiling under the surface after the confrontation with Brooke, after Emma disappeared and wouldn\u2019t answer my calls or texts. Now there\u2019s a glacier between us, cold and mountainous and lethal. When I see her talking with Brooke, staring at Blossom, glancing at me and away, I know crossing it won\u2019t be possible.</p><p>It\u2019s a good thing Will Darcy is sort of a dick, or I\u2019d never be able to pull this off.</p><p>I bristle at the idea that I should feel sorry for what happened almost four years ago, when it likely wasn\u2019t even mine to feel sorry for. I haven\u2019t thought about this shit in years. Even seeing Brooke when filming started\u2014sure, I remembered the relationship, but I sought long ago to purge the ending from my brain. The way she was hooking up with another guy, maybe several, while telling me she loved me, while getting me to say it back, feel it back. I adored her, and she betrayed me. So what if that kid might have been mine? Why should I have cared?</p><p>Emma probably doesn\u2019t see it that way; she\u2019s a girl. She views my actions as desertion. And maybe it was.</p><p>Fuck this. I have enough to deal with\u2014an alcoholic mom and a career to keep on track and build. I don\u2019t need this shit. I\u2019m done. I\u2019m so fucking done.</p><p>Emma</p><p>\u201cEmma, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>My father\u2019s question hangs in the several hundred mile space between us. I\u2019m sitting on my bed after this hell of a day, in the middle of taking an SAT practice test online. I\u2019ll have to start over if this conversation doesn\u2019t end quickly.</p><p>\u201cUm, what do you mean, exactly?\u201d I stall, unsure if he\u2019s referring to the rumors that I\u2019m sleeping with Reid, and/or Graham, or breaking up with one or both of them, or the report of my baby bump... or something else altogether.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you need to talk to me about?\u201d This is a characteristically evasive question that I\u2019m both grateful for (because I don\u2019t have to answer to anything specific) and annoyed by (does he even care?).</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s quiet for a moment, and I begin to relax. He never presses about anything like this. Sometimes he asks, because he thinks he should. But he doesn\u2019t really want to deal with it. So I\u2019m taken by surprise when he doesn\u2019t drop the subject, but instead asks a question that blows my nice predictable view of my father apart.</p><p>\u201cEmma, you know how much credibility I give to celebrity gossip, but I can\u2019t pretend it\u2019s all crap, I can\u2019t ignore it if... if you need my help. Because, dammit, I\u2019m your father, and that\u2019s my job. So I need to know,\u201d I actually hear him gulp, \u201care you pregnant?\u201d If this isn\u2019t a nightmare moment, I don\u2019t know what is.</p><p>My mouth works as though I\u2019m speaking, or chewing something, nothing but little clucks coming out until finally I say, \u201cNo. No.\u201d</p><p>He exhales, and I imagine his hand at his forehead, his eyes closed. This time, his moment of silence doesn\u2019t fool me. I\u2019m on high alert, not that it helps. \u201cI know we\u2019ve never really discussed, uh, sex, before,\u201d he charges on, \u201cbut as your father, I have to make sure you have the tools you need to be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d I say, my face flaming.</p><p>\u201cSo, you know that uh, condoms are necessary to protect yourself against not only unwanted uh, pregnancy, but also STDs\u2014er, sexually transmitted diseases...\u201d He\u2019s explaining this stuff as though I\u2019ve never heard it before, as though I haven\u2019t known it since Grandma and I talked years ago. I\u2019m thinking late much? and trying to contain my hysteria while he morphs into one giant sex ed TMI, \u201c...herpes and chlamydia. Um, I think those are the major half-dozen, though there are more, but you don\u2019t need to know them all...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad.\u201d The word feels strange, like someone else is saying it, because I don\u2019t think of him as Dad. He\u2019s my father, formal and impassive. Like our relationship has been since Mom died. \u201cI... I know all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Did Chloe\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, too harshly. \u201cNo\u2014Grandma, and Emily\u2019s mom.\u201d And then because I said Emily\u2019s name, I\u2019m crying.</p><p>\u201cEmma, what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a fight with Emily!\u201d It bursts from me, unable to be contained any longer. \u201cShe\u2019s not talking to me and I don\u2019t know what I did or what I can do or should do.\u201d</p><p>He goes quiet again, and just as I start to berate myself for blurting this out to him of all people, he asks, \u201cHave you tried calling her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. Not really. I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d I sniffle. \u201cShe thinks I was ignoring her, and maybe I was, but I didn\u2019t mean to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s what you say, sweetheart.\u201d He hasn\u2019t called me that in so long. Not like that\u2014like a caress, like a hug. \u201cYou and Emily have been like sisters for almost your whole life; she\u2019ll listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she hangs up on me? What if she hates me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma, do you really believe that\u2019s possible? Think how long you two have been attached at the hip. Now you\u2019re both about to be adults, have separate lives. Maybe she\u2019s scared of losing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why is she pushing me away?\u201d I sob.</p><p>He\u2019s quiet for a moment. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what people do sometimes, when they\u2019re scared, and they\u2019re just being reactive. Maybe you need to be the brave one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not brave,\u201d I say, my voice small.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, I don\u2019t know anyone braver than you.\u201d What? \u201cLet\u2019s make a deal, you and me. You call Emily tonight. And I\u2019ll tell Chloe that you\u2019re going to college next fall. SAT a week from Saturday, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I shake my head, saying, \u201cYou haven\u2019t told her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime for me to be brave, too,\u201d he says, not thrilled. I start laughing and he joins in.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell her about your lunches at McDonald\u2019s?\u201d I ask, teasing. I try to be rational and suppress the hope that this is for real, but hope has a way of closing its eyes to reason and it just keeps growing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s not go crazy, now,\u201d he says, all pretend-serious. \u201cIn some cases, what she doesn\u2019t know... well, you know Chloe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d I take a shuddering breath. \u201cThanks, Dad,\u201d I say, liking the sound of it, afraid that this image of him is a mirage, that if I look away and look back, it\u2019ll be gone. I think about what he said. That I\u2019m brave. If that\u2019s true, maybe I won\u2019t let him go so easily this time. Maybe I\u2019ll remind him, if he forgets again.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, sweetheart,\u201d he says, and I let that one word envelope me and shove the doubt away, at least for tonight.</p><p>\u201cNight, Dad.\u201d</p> <p>Me: I\u2019m sorry. I was selfish, but i didn\u2019t mean to be. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to make you believe me. To make you forgive me. I miss you so much.</p><p>As I hit send, I tell myself that a sliver of bravery is better than a load of cowardice. It will hurt less to have her ignore a text than it will if I call and she doesn\u2019t answer and I get her voicemail, or worse, if she answers and tells me that she meant everything she said.</p><p>I survive an agonizing five minutes, during which I rock in the middle of my bed, my arms around my knees, staring at the phone in my hand as though I can\u2019t trust sound alone to tell me if she texts back. When it rings, I startle and drop it onto the bed, then grab it up. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>Her voice is so soft I can barely hear her. So unlike Emily. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, too,\u201d she says, and we both start crying and talking at the same time. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily I\u2019m so sorry\u2014\u201d</p> <p>And then we\u2019re laughing and crying, and she says, \u201cLet me start. First, don\u2019t ever let me do this again, even if you have to send Chloe over to bitch-slap some sense into me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, seriously. Second, for a long time I\u2019ve congratulated myself on what a great friend I am\u2014with you being on television, then getting this movie and getting famous, and me not being a bit jealous. Then all of a sudden you\u2019re having this fantasy romance while I\u2019m scared to death that I\u2019m about to have the worst case of pathetic unrequited love ever with a guy who works at the freaking Abercrombie. So it turns out that I\u2019m a horrible friend\u2014\u201d she hiccups.</p><p>\u201cEmily, no you\u2019re not, I am\u2014\u201d I object, but she plows on as though I haven\u2019t spoken.</p><p>\u201c\u2014and your fantasy romance has gone to the shitter and it\u2019s clearly all my fault for deserting you when you needed me!\u201d Now she\u2019s bawling, and I butt in while I can.</p><p>\u201cEmily, I\u2019m okay, and you\u2019re not a horrible friend, you\u2019re the best friend ever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPsshh!\u201d</p><p>Before she can object more, I say, \u201cHonest, I\u2019m okay. I\u2019ve been more upset thinking I was losing you than anything else going on. I\u2019m sorry for making you feel like I always got your attention when you never got mine, for making you feel like I didn\u2019t care about your problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEm, that\u2019s not even true. I was just jealous. Forget what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You needed me, and I was obsessing over Reid and Graham, and I should have been listening to what you needed, instead of expecting you to always be the one listening. When I lost you, I didn\u2019t care much about anything else.\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cEven if I felt ignored, I knew better. You\u2019ve never not been there for me. Jesus Christ, I just used a double negative. Clearly I\u2019m traumatized! Please, just forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I forgive you. Happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I sniffle.</p> <p>\u201cOkay. Now what in holy hell is going on down there? Mom is off her freaking noodle\u2014she called your father and ripped him a new one. She even used a couple of actual curse words! Not any really good ones, but still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that explains that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called earlier... do you think he only did it because she told him\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. At first, yeah, she was all over him, but then they started talking, and from her answers, he was asking the right questions. I think he had no idea how badly he was doing. Until, you know, she told him, in that way that only Mom can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow. What\u2019s going on with this baby bump crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily, I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know that. I also know how conflicted you were over Reid and Graham. And it looks like everything just blew to hell. So what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long do you have?\u201d I ask, lying back on the bed.</p><p>\u201cAll night, baby. I even called Derek before I called you, and I told him, \u2018Don\u2019t call me; I\u2019ll call you,\u2019 so we have as long as you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily, I\u2019m doing it again, we should talk about Derek\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything is fine with Derek; he can wait, we\u2019ll talk about him soon enough, don\u2019t you worry. So quit stalling and start talking.\u201d</p><p>I tell her everything. And the first thing she says after is, \u201cWow. I had no idea how much I missed knowing more than the freaking National Enquirer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEm,\u201d she says then, \u201chave you ever noticed that you say \u2018huh\u2019 whenever you can\u2019t think of anything else to say?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 41</p><p>REID</p><p>I almost feel sorry for Blossom. I couldn\u2019t tolerate her for even a full twenty-four hours. Turns out there actually is such a thing as too much flattery and adoration. Next up was a girl playing a Netherfield High cheerleader (I asked her to leave the costume mostly on), followed by a woman billed as one of the teachers.</p><p>I\u2019ve avoided any social interaction with cast mates\u2014except Tadd and Quinton\u2014until tonight, when everyone is gathering in Brooke\u2019s room to celebrate Jenna\u2019s birthday. I\u2019ve stupidly brought last night\u2019s girl along. Vivian was hot and inventive in bed; out of it she\u2019s rude and grating. Even still, I need a buffer between myself and Emma, or I\u2019m going to end up doing something rash like getting on my knees and pleading for mercy.</p><p>Tadd is opening a bottle of Riesling, sort of. He\u2019s actually mangling the crap out of the cork as Emma looks on, laughing as they pour the wine into glasses and then fish bits of cork out of each one, using straws, spoons, napkins and toothpicks.</p><p>\u201cDid you chew the cork off, Thaddeus?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cPiss off, man,\u201d Tadd says as he traps the last piece.</p><p>Vivian slides up to me and asks, \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d while fixing Emma with a defiant stare. Christ. I do not need this.</p><p>\u201cGetting you something to drink, babe.\u201d I grab a glass and hand it to her with a smile, wondering if alcohol will make her mellow or more belligerent. She stands on her tiptoes and rubs my nose with hers, marking territory. Holy shit, you\u2019ve got to be kidding.</p><p>Emma, sharing a look with Tadd, sticks a finger in her mouth, her tongue out, and he chuckles. Unfortunately, Vivian catches the pantomime. She narrows her eyes at Emma and snaps, \u201cGot a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey now,\u201d I steer her to the opposite side of the room, \u201cnobody\u2019s got a problem.\u201d</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t my appendix have died tonight? It\u2019s a toss-up which was more painful, that night or this one.</p><p>Emma</p><p>For almost two weeks, I\u2019ve had a freaking front row seat as Reid cuts a trail through the cast of female extras. Step right up. Reid Alexander is accepting applications for one-night internships. On one hand, I don\u2019t care, and on the other, it\u2019s borderline humiliating and I feel like a total dumbass for thinking I could be some sort of exception for the way he is with girls.</p><p>I\u2019ve avoided talking to or looking at him or tonight\u2019s plaything, but I could feel her eyes on me from the moment they came in the room. With the SAT tomorrow, I\u2019m avoiding alcohol, but I assisted Tadd with uncorking the Riesling bottle. We managed to disintegrate the cork with the corkscrew, and while we were fishing chunks of cork out of the glasses, Reid appeared at my side with his date, who attached herself to him like a barnacle to a ship.</p><p>She was trying to start something before he dragged her away. I don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m jealous. You\u2019d think being an actress would help in situations like this, but we\u2019re human, with emotions like everyone else, and sometimes they just won\u2019t stay submerged. I escaped onto the balcony to pull it together.</p><p>I close my eyes and breathe until Graham comes outside and stands next to me, hands in his pockets; I know he\u2019s there when I inhale the familiar spicy scent of him. We scan the view as the sky darkens and the streetlamps flicker on. He doesn\u2019t speak for several minutes, and I consider the fact that he and I spend a lot of our time together not talking, comfortable in each other\u2019s company despite long silences. This is probably the result of running together, the exertion not always conducive to conversation.</p><p>\u201cSAT tomorrow, right?\u201d I love the texture of his voice, the husky timbre that triggers reverberations somewhere inside me. Too bad for me that he belongs to Brooke.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I guess I\u2019ve got my excuse to bail early tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Are you doing okay, with\u2014?\u201d He indicates the indoors, and Reid.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>Brooke joins us then. \u201cHey, are you okay? Because trust me, I\u2019d love to tell him to take his skank and get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I lie.</p><p>\u201cWell just say the word and they\u2019re out on their asses.\u201d She gives my shoulder a squeeze and goes back inside.</p><p>My world has done a 180: I want Reid to disappear, and somehow Brooke and I have become BFFs. What. The. Hell.</p><p>An hour later I\u2019m in my room, bitching to Emily. \u201c...and Reid\u2019s piece of ass for the night was getting territorial. Like I\u2019m competition. As if.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, how many does that make?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour\u2014that I know of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, what a man whore.\u201d</p><p>I sigh, throwing myself against the pillows. \u201cIf he\u2019s going to start bringing them around when we all hang out, I don\u2019t think I can handle it. It\u2019s hard enough just sitting in the same room with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEm, maybe you\u2019re more hurt about this than you\u2019re letting on,\u201d she suggests.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just pissed, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so...\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t believe me, but I need to forget Reid for a moment, forget where I am and everything I\u2019m feeling. \u201cI do. And in other news\u2014how\u2019s Derek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDerek\u2019s good,\u201d she says, and if there\u2019s such a thing as being able to hear a smile, I\u2019m hearing her smiling through the phone.</p><p>Chapter 42</p><p>REID</p><p>Production rented out the thirtieth floor of an office building in freaking Dallas for Rosings Corp headquarters. Which means three days (and two nights) on location in Dallas with Graham, Emma and MiShaun. I\u2019m not exactly a favorite of any of them at the moment.</p><p>I head for the elevator Monday morning, a travel bag slung over my shoulder, my arm around last night\u2019s entertainment. She\u2019s giggling and wearing my shirt (dammit, I\u2019ll probably never see that again, and it\u2019s one of my favorites). She\u2019s cute, but after a night of her, I\u2019m desperately craving silence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As we round the corner, Emma has just pulled the door to her room shut and stands in the hallway, grasping the handle on her rolling carry-on bag. She turns back to the door as soon as she sees me, but it\u2019s too late\u2014it\u2019s clicked closed and automatically locked; we\u2019re all stuck in the hallway together.</p><p>As we pass her, I say, \u201cGood morning, Emma.\u201d</p><p>Lips pursed, she raises her eyes to mine before sweeping them away as she turns towards the elevator. \u201cGood morning,\u201d she murmurs.</p><p>Pointlessly, the girl in my shirt giggles. I angle her shoulders towards her room and swat her ass, resisting the urge to shove her in that direction. \u201cGet some sleep, young lady.\u201d</p> <p>Ow!\u201d she says, followed by more giggling. Jesus.</p><p>Following Emma to the elevator, I can\u2019t help but inventory everything I ever found physically attractive about her\u2014how her hair flows over her shoulders, the way she holds herself as she walks, the curve of her hip and the line of muscle down the side of her legs below the hem of her white shorts, the wrist of stacked bracelets on her left arm, and on her right hand, the silver band with the story I\u2019ll never learn. We enter the elevator and ride to the ground floor in silence, her pale shoulder against the opposite wall. I hum to myself as we take what feels like the slowest descent in the history of motorized, pulley-operated boxes. I find myself thinking Is this goddamned thing even moving? I could crawl down the stairs faster, when not long ago, the two of us appreciated the elevator\u2019s lethargic pace.</p><p>Graham and MiShaun are in the lobby, along with Bob, who walkies that he\u2019s bringing us out. Luckily, the early hour yields just a couple of paparazzi photogs. MiShaun takes Emma\u2019s arm, talking nonsense on the way to the car. She sits next to Emma and Graham takes the seat across from her. They\u2019ve joined forces to make sure I\u2019m as far from her as possible.</p><p>Awesome.</p><p>Emma</p> <p>\u201cYou never told me how the SAT went.\u201d Graham loads his tortilla with some of everything from the fajita platter we\u2019re sharing, including the sour cream, cheese and guacamole that I avoid lest I be accused of another baby bump. The two of us found a Tex-Mex place for our last meal out in Dallas. MiShaun\u2019s computer guy is in town on some consulting project, so she\u2019s with him, and Reid is probably hooking up with one of the new extras or a local groupie. Filming was hell, but it\u2019s done.</p><p>\u201cThe exam was protracted and arduous.\u201d I tap my foot to the rhythm of the music in the background as I select lean pieces of grilled chicken and veggies. Graham smiles, and I notice a bit of sour cream at the corner of his mouth. I wonder what he\u2019d do if I reached out a finger and cleaned it off. Maybe with a napkin. Maybe I should just say something. Maybe just ignore it.</p><p>\u201cSounds traumatic,\u201d he says. Huh? Oh, the SAT.</p><p>I shrug, take a sip of iced tea and glance back at his mouth. Sour cream still there. I have a vision of leaning across the table and licking it off, and I blurt, \u201cYou have a little...\u201d and point to the corner of my mouth. He pulls the napkin off his lap and swabs at the corner.</p><p>\u201cGone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Must stop staring at his mouth. I lean back into the soft leather booth and force myself to look away from him. If Graham and Brooke are together, or trying to be, then I have no business contemplating... licking him.</p> <p>\u201cFans, three o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I say, and he raises an eyebrow. \u201cOkay, that doesn\u2019t count. That was basically a question, not a huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI\u2019ll spot you that one.\u201d</p><p>I try to be covert in looking over my shoulder, but covert doesn\u2019t matter\u2014an entire table of sorority girls is staring back. My glancing at them ignites all of them to begin talking to each other excitedly, and then the cell phones emerge.</p><p>\u201cCrap. Can we leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t paid yet.\u201d He looks for our server, motions her over. \u201cRestaurants sorta frown on customers who leave without paying. Even famous ones.\u201d The server arrives with the check and Graham hands her a credit card. \u201cYou know, we talked about this a while back. It\u2019s going to happen even more, once the movie\u2019s released.\u201d He laughs softly as I scowl at my lap. \u201cEmma,\u201d he says, prompting me to look at him. He\u2019s leaning up, his forearms folded in front of him on the table, his eyes dark and direct. \u201cYou\u2019re the lead female role in a major studio film. This is about to be your normality.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right, of course. I lean up on my forearms, too. \u201cEmily told me the fan pages are going crazy wondering why Reid\u2019s being seen with everyone but me.\u201d I could get so lost in his eyes. I must stop gazing into them like I want to get lost there. \u201cYou know what this will do, me being photographed at what will no doubt be described as an intimate dinner, with you.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, signing the receipt and stowing his card away. \u201cI can take it. Now put on a little attitude, and let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d He calls our driver to meet us out front and takes my hand as we exit, and despite the people staring, pointing cell phones, or just plain pointing, I feel calm with my hand in his.</p> <p>Chapter 43</p><p>REID</p><p>The last weeks of filming are moving in a blur.</p><p>According to the fan pages, Emma and Graham continue their morning runs and are rumored to be making out all over town\u2014despite no photographic evidence beyond the hand-holding incident in Dallas. In private, they\u2019re no different near each other than they\u2019ve ever been. Easy familiarity, but no staring across the room as though they can hardly wait to get each other alone and no touching that I\u2019ve witnessed or heard about. Graham continues to appoint himself as Brooke\u2019s protector\u2014which at least I get now. I still think they\u2019re involved.</p><p>Emma was chosen to play Lizbeth because of the chemistry between us, which refuses to ebb just because we want it to. And oh, how I want it to. Delivering Will Darcy\u2019s declarations of love to Lizbeth is torture. Touching her is torture. Kissing her is torture.</p><p>When possible, I bow out of any group social activities in which Emma might be involved. Tadd, of course, is the one who notices my discomfort. Or maybe he\u2019s just the only one who gives a shit or doesn\u2019t automatically think I deserve to reap what I\u2019ve sown. \u201cAlmost over, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d We\u2019re on set, waiting to see if Richter wants any more takes on the argument between Will and Charlie, when Charlie figures out that his best friend sabotaged his relationship with Jane. I sense Tadd isn\u2019t referring to today\u2019s filming, though. The chemistry between us on film is as easy as our relationship has always been, so we\u2019re probably good.</p><p>Swinging his hair out of his eyes, he levels a look on me, his mouth in that sarcastic twist I know so well. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you so whipped, man. Why don\u2019t you just give up and beg her forgiveness?\u201d</p><p>My mouth drops open. \u201cIn one sentence you\u2019re calling me whipped and in the next you\u2019re suggesting I plead for mercy? What the hell, man. That makes no sense.\u201d</p><p>He sighs noisily, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cYeah, it kinda does. You managed to be a dickwad to someone you were falling for. You could try apologizing. God knows you\u2019ve given screwing her out of your head your best shot.\u201d He chuckles softly. \u201cSo not working, by the way.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the object of this discussion across the room where she sips from a water bottle and laughs at something Meredith just said, and my jaw clenches. \u201cI\u2019m not falling on my face at her feet so she can kick me more easily. That\u2019d be fucking stupid, not to mention degrading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore degrading than it is for her to watch you bed every girl in the cast?\u201d</p><p>I love the guy, but God, Tadd is a know-it-all sometimes. \u201cShe listened to Brooke\u2019s side and didn\u2019t even ask mine,\u201d I hiss. \u201cWhere\u2019s her apology to me?\u201d When the production assistant looks over, I know this discussion has gone too far. I don\u2019t want to debate whether or not I should apologize to Emma for some perceived thing I did to Brooke.</p><p>Tadd turns to me, his clear blue eyes unnaturally serious. \u201cDude, you\u2019re miserable\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m pissed. But like you said, it\u2019s almost over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood job, gentlemen,\u201d Richter says then. \u201cNo more retakes, you can vamoose.\u201d</p><p>As we turn, Tadd nods once, clamping his mouth shut and containing whatever he was going to say. I\u2019m deaf once I\u2019ve made up my mind, and I\u2019ve always been good at shutting my emotions off. I\u2019m getting better.</p><p>Emma</p><p>I\u2019m home.</p><p>The last weeks of filming were challenging, not because of the scenes themselves as much as what happened between them. When Reid and I filmed intimate scenes, staring into each others\u2019 eyes and reciting the play of words between Will and Lizbeth as they fell in love despite all intentions otherwise, he was utterly convincing. But Richter\u2019s \u201cCut!\u201d shut off the passion and devotion in his eyes like a thrown switch.</p><p>I was afraid kissing him would be unbearable, but with preparation, once my eyes were closed, I became Lizbeth Bennet kissing Will Darcy, and Reid Alexander wasn\u2019t there anymore. There were a couple of times I wasn\u2019t prepared, and the trace of his mouth on mine constricted my breath. Both times, I could have sworn he was affected as well, until the inevitable end to the scene, when he blinked and the connection was gone.</p><p>On the last day of filming, the celebratory mood was shaded with the bittersweet grief of ending. Simultaneous laughter and tears, hugs and promises of keeping in touch were passed between all of us. Reid\u2019s lips grazed my temple, briefly, before he turned away to do the boy-hug thing with Quinton. He and Richter left the hotel that night. The rest of us checked out the next day.</p><p>Graham and I took a taxi to the airport together; our flights were at the crack of dawn, departing within ten minutes of each other. We got through security more quickly than we\u2019d expected, and decided to hang out at the cramped coffee bar. We sat watching the other travelers: some bleary-eyed, some lost, some type-A frustrated with all the others.</p><p>Graham tore off a hunk of the cinnamon roll we were sharing. \u201cHave you applied anywhere yet?\u201d he asked, consuming his sticky portion in one bite.</p><p>\u201cDoing that when I get home. We\u2019ve got everything organized\u2014which schools want an essay, which have extensive applications, which require recommendation letters.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you\u2014after graduation?\u201d I nibbled at a much smaller segment of our joint breakfast, licking my fingers reflexively. And then Graham was staring at my fingers and mouth, suffusing me with an unexpected warmth so strong it felt visible. As he lowered his gaze to the last bit of roll, I wiped my fingers on the napkin in my lap while struggling to stop imagining his mouth sucking the sticky sweetness from each one, slowly and thoroughly. \u201cYou can, um, have the rest.\u201d I strove to sound impassive and heedless of the electricity zipping through my body.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cMy agent called yesterday\u2014I\u2019ve got another indie film lined up for mid-summer, to be filmed in New York.\u201d After looking at me for another long moment, he said, \u201cIf you decide on a university there, I\u2019ll probably be around when you start next fall.\u201d He clicked his phone, checking the time. \u201cWe\u2019d better get to our gates.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We stood at the same time and faced each other; our gates were in opposite directions. He reached for me and I walked into his arms. I pressed my face to his chest, breathed in his scent. He was going to walk away, and I was going to let him go without ever asking him why he\u2019d kissed me. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you, Emma,\u201d he said. Under my ear, his chest resonated faintly with my name.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you, too.\u201d</p><p>Relaxing his hold, he took my face in his hands and kissed my temple softly. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you more,\u201d he whispered before turning to gather his bags. When he was fifteen or twenty feet away, he looked back, tipped his chin, and smiled at me. I gave a little wave and took a deep breath, memorizing his familiar gait. The way he paid no attention to the girls who turned to watch him pass. The way I felt the loss of him already, when he was still within my sight.</p><p>\u201cSo... I think he took that well,\u201d Dad says after the phone call to Dan to tell him I would be taking a hiatus from blockbuster roles so I could go to college. Dad rubs the back of his neck with one hand while he stares at the phone in the other.</p> <p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t a very good liar, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s received the news. I guess how he likes it is his problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d Chloe says from the kitchen table, where she\u2019s grading exams. She\u2019s still disgruntled that I\u2019m giving up my film career, possibly for good. Her dreams of being the mother of a huge star, jet-setting all over the world, rubbing elbows with celebrities, have been dashed. She didn\u2019t speak to either of us for days, but she\u2019s almost resigned herself to the idea now. I think.</p><p>Dad winks at me, leaning over her shoulder and telling her, \u201cI thought you and I could use a weekend getaway. Visit a winery or two... stay at a B-and-B?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She brightens, and then her expression falls. \u201cBut what about\u2014\u201d she gestures towards me as I pour a glass of orange juice.</p> <p>\u201cEmma\u2019s an adult now, Chloe. She can handle a weekend at home alone.\u201d When he mentioned the idea last week, I assured him I was more than fine with it.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say. \u201cYou kids go, have fun.\u201d</p><p>I scroll through my texts as I walk to my room. There\u2019s a thread with Graham from last night that I want to reread.</p><p>Graham: Hey, birthday girl</p><p>Me: You remembered</p><p>Graham: Of course. Doing anything special to celebrate being 18?</p> <p>Me: Like what, voting?</p><p>Graham: HA</p><p>Me: Just going to dinner with dad and chloe</p><p>Graham: How is that going btw</p><p>Me: Really well, actually</p><p>Graham: Good. I just registered for my last semester. Heading upstate with my sisters for some r&amp;r this weekend.</p><p>Me: Jealous. I always wanted sisters.</p><p>Graham: Trust me, it was the opposite of awesome for the first 15 years, until i was cool enough for them to know me in public.</p> <p>Me: Lol. Enjoy your weekend.</p><p>Graham: Thx, you too</p><p>I move the text into permanent storage on my phone. I haven\u2019t seen anyone from School Pride in the weeks since we wrapped the film. The new version of my old life has reabsorbed me. These few lines and a few weeks of memories\u2014countless conversations and one unforgettable kiss\u2014are all I have left of Graham.</p><p>The day I met Derek, he and Emily had both just gotten off work. Each was dressed to sell an image to their respective customers\u2014most of whom wouldn\u2019t be caught dead in each other\u2019s social circles. From the violet stripes in her dark hair and her black-tipped fingernails to her biker boots with buckles running ankle to mid-calf, she couldn\u2019t have appeared more incompatible with him\u2014tan and lanky with short blond hair, dressed in a button-down shirt, untucked, skinny chinos and Sperrys. As I watched them from my bedroom, I couldn\u2019t help the thought that they were doomed. And then, taking her hand, he pulled her to a stop and smiled down at her like she was everything in the world that made him happy. As he framed her face with careful hands and kissed her, she melted into him.</p><p>Emily confessed that they\u2019re applying to the same colleges, mostly her choice. Derek\u2019s aspirations include earning an English degree while writing a novel\u2014and he says any decent academic environment will do. I\u2019ve never seen her like this. My best friend, independent and uncompromising our entire lives, has fallen in love. Hard.</p><p>I\u2019m still stuck on living in New York, though I no longer feel the need to escape my home state. Once the prospect of moving there lodged itself in my mind, everything else seemed inferior by comparison. Dad and Emily have resigned themselves to losing me to the east coast, at least for a while.</p><p>I did some community theatre over the holidays\u2014a starring role in a low-budget production of It\u2019s a Wonderful Life. Dad didn\u2019t miss a single show. The thought of leaving him next fall stings, though I\u2019ve been coming and going for years. But it\u2019s good. The sting tells me I\u2019ll miss him and the way he looks at me now\u2014like he hasn\u2019t seen me in years, like he can\u2019t get enough now that I\u2019m here.</p><p>Chapter 44</p><p>REID</p><p>It\u2019s March, five months since we wrapped up School Pride. I\u2019ve hung out with Tadd several times since then and Quinton twice. I haven\u2019t seen or heard from anyone else. Now, the main cast is in Austin for a couple of days to do a photo spread for Vanity Fair. My flight arrived late, and no one\u2019s up and about when I check into the hotel. Disoriented to be back in Austin, I fall asleep thinking of Emma. My dreams are vivid and unsettling, receding to the edges of my consciousness when I wake, yielding no clear details and leaving me anything but rested. Coffee and breakfast from room service delays the prospect of seeing any of them until the concierge calls to let me know the limo has arrived.</p><p>When I exit my room and turn the corner, she\u2019s standing in front of the elevator. \u201cEmma,\u201d I say softly, not wanting to startle her. Her shoulders tense slightly, but she turns with a pleasant, if artificial, expression.</p><p>\u201cHi, Reid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking good,\u201d I say, and she does.</p><p>\u201cThanks. You, too.\u201d</p><p>The elevator doors part and we enter and stand a foot apart, staring at the descending numbers. Memories swirl around us, sharp and silent\u2014how I would back her against a wall as soon as the elevator doors shut behind us, pinning her against the cold stainless steel panel while my hands skimmed her waist and my mouth moved over hers until neither of us could think straight. I wonder if she\u2019s forgotten.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Emma, lie back with your head in Reid\u2019s lap. That\u2019s good. Reid, one hand on her stomach.\u201d The VF photographer is Virgil, one of those artists so well-known that a surname is unnecessary. He\u2019s known for sensual, romantic photo spreads. Arranging Emma\u2019s hair to cascade over my knee and pool on the blanket they\u2019ve spread over the rough boards of the dock, he says, \u201cEmma, at me. Reid, at her... longing, desire on your face.\u201d No problem there.</p><p>Snap, snap, snap.</p><p>The next series has me perched on a stool while she sits on my lap, facing me, her legs locked around my hips. She\u2019s making a concerted effort to keep her eyes averted\u2014quite a feat in this position. \u201cThese are waist-up shots, but I need you guys close,\u201d Virgil says. \u201cEmma, arch into him.\u201d Snap, snap, snap. \u201cGood, now lean your head back, chin up.\u201d Snap, snap.</p><p>\u201cBack farther, eyes closed.\u201d I press my mouth against her throat, and Virgil is euphoric. \u201cStunning.\u201d Snap, snap. He crooks her arm, moving her hand to the back of my head, holding me in place over her heart, the beats echoing through me as we stare into the camera and Virgil snaps like there isn\u2019t enough film in the world to capture this moment.</p><p>We stand back to back, our hands joined at our sides, while I look out over the lake, spotlighting what\u2019s been termed my \u201carchetypal male profile.\u201d Resting her head between my shoulder blades, Emma stares into the camera as Virgil snaps off shots. \u201cEmma, gaze over my shoulder. Imagine you\u2019re far away, somewhere lovely and perfect...\u201d</p><p>Off to the right, the others are gathered, talking and watching distractedly, waiting their turns. Quinton and Tadd stand behind the others, laughing. The girls sit in a semi-circle, Jenna reading, the others talking. Graham reclines just apart from them, legs out in front, ankles crossed, leaning back on his elbows, watching Emma. His mouth turns up on one side and I know she\u2019s returning his gaze. His chin tips back, hey, and Virgil murmurs, \u201cPerfect,\u201d firing off rapid snaps.</p><p>The group shots are full of clowning around, some of which will make it into the spread, most of which won\u2019t. Quinton, Tadd, Graham and I, holding Emma horizontally across our middles like a burlesque singer. A hands and knees pyramid, guys on bottom, then Brooke, MiShaun and Meredith, with Jenna and Emma on top. Tadd groans and pretends to crumple under the weight as tiny Jenna climbs atop Brooke and Meredith, and everyone screams and laughs as the whole thing nearly crashes to the mats covered in blankets and sand.</p><p>Tomorrow will be divided up, girls in the morning, guys in the afternoon. \u201cNo hangovers, dudes,\u201d Virgil says. \u201cThe camera isn\u2019t kind to dehydrated, red-eyed subjects.\u201d He chuckles as our eyes roll and we drag ourselves to the waiting cars.</p><p>I duck into a car with Emma, Meredith and Jenna. Touching Emma\u2019s shoulder, I draw her out of their conversation. She\u2019s as wary of me as she was in the elevator this morning. \u201cStill going off to college in the fall? Have you chosen one yet?\u201d</p><p>Her hands are clasped in her lap, and I maintain a small empty space between us. \u201cI\u2019m visiting a couple next month, making a final decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>The four of us talk about upcoming projects, and Jenna grills Emma on the colleges she\u2019s chosen to visit next month and what she\u2019ll be studying. I shouldn\u2019t be surprised that they\u2019re both in New York\u2014for theatre it makes sense\u2014but I wonder what this has to do with Graham, and if it has everything to do with him. We arrive at the hotel and everyone decides on room service in my room, sans Meredith, who\u2019s staying in her room with Robby the Controlling Boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cThat guy is a total dick,\u201d Tadd tells Emma, using the shaker from my bar to make margaritas. \u201cHow can she like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea,\u201d she answers as he unscrews the shaker, pouring the mixture into three glasses, handing one to her, one to me.</p><p>\u201cA friend of mine got into a seriously messed up relationship with a possessive guy,\u201d he continues after taking a sip. \u201cHe checked his phone messages, separated him from his friends, hacked into his computer. It was a fucking nightmare. Actually, he said the fucking was pretty good, the rest was a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>Emma and I narrowly avoid spraying him with margarita.</p><p>\u201cGetting everyone hammered already, are you, Tadd?\u201d Brooke says as she joins us.</p><p>\u201cWant one?\u201d he asks. \u201cThey\u2019re magically delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please\u2014one for Graham, too. He\u2019ll be here in a sec. He\u2019s on a call.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m looking at Emma when Brooke mentions Graham, and I can\u2019t unsee the split second of joy that crosses her face. The apprehension that follows it. After filming was over, speculation about the two of them fell off completely. According to the media, she and I managed to hook up a couple of times\u2014rather unreasonable given the fact that we haven\u2019t been in the same city since filming ended. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There won\u2019t be any drinking games tonight in light of Virgil\u2019s edict against hangovers. Everyone is relaxed and nostalgic, knowing that after this one night, there will be a few high profile premiers in May and that will be it. Even if any of us work together in the future, it will never be this group again.</p><p>Graham comes in, folding his legs and settling on the floor between Brooke and Emma. \u201cHey, Emma,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d She returns the smile and looks away, listening to the discussion between the others. Nothing else passes between them that I see.</p><p>\u201cMaybe they\u2019ll want a sequel,\u201d MiShaun says. \u201cWill and Lizbeth get married and settle down to a life of brooding, bookishness and boredom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way to ruin the idyllic dream of Darcy and Elizabeth for all time,\u201d Tadd agrees. \u201cShow what it was really like once they got married.\u201d He turns to Quinton. \u201cYou\u2019re a gloomy twat!\u201d he says in a falsetto voice.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re just like your mother!\u201d Quinton barks.</p><p>As everyone leaves a couple of hours later, I take Emma\u2019s arm, gently. \u201cEmma, hold up a moment. I want to ask you something.\u201d She\u2019s guarded, but nods her assent.</p><p>Emma</p><p>\u201cCome sit.\u201d Reid takes my hand and leads me to the sofa.</p> <p>\u201cUm, we have to get up early\u2014well, I have to get up early, I guess you don\u2019t have to be there until later...\u201d The excuses tumble through my brain disjointedly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that late,\u201d he says, and I decide to just hear him out. We sit. \u201cYou looked gorgeous today.\u201d He\u2019s still holding my hand. \u201cI couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s as beautiful as ever, dark blue eyes sweeping over my face, his blondish hair a bit darker, a bit longer, still perfectly disordered. I blink, his words settling around me. \u201cReid, what are you\u2014? I mean, I don\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma, I made a mistake. A huge mistake. I was upset when you disappeared that night, but I should have never given you an ultimatum; it was thoughtless and juvenile. I should\u2019ve waited for you to talk to me. I could have explained. You\u2019re reasonable and fair, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019d have listened.\u201d</p><p>My heart slams out a rhythm in my chest, pulses it through my body. \u201cBut... you didn\u2019t wait. You didn\u2019t explain. You just went off with the first girl, and then the second, third, fourth, I mean Jesus, I stopped counting after that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was reactionary, just trying to make you jealous\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you were trying to show me how unimportant I was. And you succeeded.\u201d</p><p>This is the combat zone we sidestepped when he took up with Blossom and I just let him go. There\u2019d been no confrontation, no breakup. My throat closes up now as I fight tears. I didn\u2019t think, at the time, that he\u2019d actually injured me. I thought I was just pissed off at his attempts to humiliate me. An ambush of emotions takes over as I realize I sold the whole thing short. What he\u2019d done had hurt. And apparently still did.</p><p>He wipes his thumbs under my eyes, carefully removing tears. \u201cEmma, I\u2019m an arrogant guy. I\u2019m used to having things my way, every time, with every girl. You were different. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t get you out of my head.\u201d He leans up, cradling my face between his palms. \u201cForgive me. Please.\u201d His eyes are mesmerizing, dark blue, and I know there\u2019s more depth to him than he\u2019s allowed me to see, but it isn\u2019t enough.</p><p>\u201cI forgive you,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I can\u2019t forget. And I can\u2019t trust you, Reid.\u201d</p><p>He takes both of my hands in his. \u201cI could be different with you.\u201d He\u2019s so sincere that it takes everything in me to think logically. \u201cYou may be the only one who\u2019ll see through all my bullshit and help me try to be something more, something better.\u201d</p><p>I stare at our intertwined hands. \u201cI don\u2019t want to help you try to be anything. I want someone who\u2019s already something more. On his own. With or without me.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s quiet then, and I don\u2019t dare look at him yet. \u201cIs there someone else?\u201d</p><p>I think of Graham. Graham, who cannot be mine. \u201cNo, there isn\u2019t. But that\u2019s really not the point.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen what is the point?\u201d He tips my chin up with his fingers, making me look into his eyes again.</p><p>My chin trembles, tears spilling over onto his hand. \u201cThe point is, I\u2019m not going to settle for less than I want, less than I deserve. Brooke trusted you, and you abandoned her\u2014and yes,\u201d I say before he can object, \u201cmaybe you were just too young to handle the situation at the time, but you never gave me a chance to find that out. You started screwing your way through the rest of the cast like my feelings didn\u2019t matter. I forgive you, because I\u2019m past it. But that\u2019s the thing. I\u2019m past it.\u201d</p><p>With the last bit of effort I can manage, I get up and leave his room, shaking from head to toe. He doesn\u2019t speak, doesn\u2019t follow, but I can\u2019t unclench my shoulders until I\u2019m in my room, the door shut and bolted behind me. I flip on a light and fall onto the bed, crying and dialing.</p><p>\u201cEmily,\u201d I say when she answers, feeling ten times better the moment I hear her voice.</p><p>Chapter 45</p><p>REID</p><p>It begins the same way it did last time, with a glass of wine during dinner. Within a week, it\u2019s a cocktail before dinner, and wine during. And then something before bed. When it moves into the daylight hours, it\u2019s all over.</p><p>Some people leap off of the wagon and some people fall. My mother simply climbs down, calmly and with the same resolve under which she\u2019s checked herself into rehab three times. The first time she tried to get help was when she\u2019d discovered she was pregnant, but she lost the baby during that first cut-short stint of rehab. When she came home and sank into depression, numbing herself regularly because otherwise she did nothing but cry, no one blamed her\u2014not her ten-year-old son, not her husband, not her mother, who lived with us.</p><p>My grandmother tried to get her to go back and get the help and counseling she needed to deal with her grief, but Mom wouldn\u2019t go back. Her refusals are never loud and messy. Her dissent is genius, really. She never constructs an argument or has an ugly outburst. She merely nods agreement to whatever is proposed, and then doesn\u2019t follow through.</p><p>Whether from the grief of losing her mother, or guilt of never living up her to own expectations of being the perfect daughter, Mom tried rehab for the second time a few months after Grandmother died. I returned from being on location\u2014the movie where I met Brooke\u2014to find her gone. Dad was happy. He thought she would kick her addiction and all would be well with the world and the Alexander family.</p><p>Clearly that was a stretch.</p><p>I don\u2019t remember when she began drinking again that time, just that I had already started by then. I felt better that she was, too, for some irrational reason.</p><p>Brook and I had broken up\u2014exploded, more like, after multiple allegations that she was cheating on me surfaced. When she told me she was pregnant, I told her, \u201cWhat\u2019s it to me? Sounds like your problem.\u201d I was utterly convinced it wasn\u2019t mine. I\u2019m not sure now, not that it matters anymore.</p><p>Mom knows I drink. Somehow, though, she managed to be stunned when I went out with John on my nineteenth birthday\u2014a couple of weeks ago\u2014and got so loaded that I\u2019m not exactly sure what we did after some point. That\u2019s the first and only time I\u2019ve ever actually blacked out. I woke up in agony at John\u2019s place, my hand swollen double and throbbing with no idea why.</p><p>According to him, we and some other guys pulled an SUV under a fire escape, climbed to the top of a building, screwed around (particularly horrifying considering I was drunk enough not to remember any of this) and then attempted to descend without falling. I failed right at the end and fell on top of the SUV, but seemed fine, John said\u2014offering as evidence the fact that I was laughing the whole time. I\u2019d broken my left hand. The hand surgeon had to operate to remove stray bone fragments, set it correctly, and insert a metal rod in my thumb, which is a bitch. I go in to have the rod removed in a few weeks, and then I have to go\u2014I kid you not\u2014to hand therapy twice a week for I don\u2019t know how long.</p><p>Days after that little mishap was the first time I came home to Mom with a drink in her hand. She\u2019d even made it through the holidays this time, but she couldn\u2019t make it past my thwarted fire escape stunt. Dad had been coming home a bit earlier sometimes, making it to dinner here and there, making weekend appearances. Once the relapse occurred, those changes came to a screeching halt.</p><p>Way to be supportive, Dad. Everything back to normal, whatever the fuck that is.</p><p>Emma</p><p>While Dad orders coffee drinks, I fantasize about mittens and campfires and down-filled blankets. My fingers are numb from the unexpected cold that is April in NYC, and I crave the latte as much for the digit-thawing warmth of the cup as for the caffeine the double shot of espresso promises. New York will take some getting used to after a lifetime in California; very little resembles my suburban hometown\u2014the local dialects, the crowds, the weather. I remind myself that different was sort of the original idea.</p><p>As I glance around looking for an open table, I see a tiny girl wearing a man\u2019s jacket over a lime green leotard and tights with a pink tulle tutu. The jacket hangs past her knees, and her small arms are no match for the sleeve length. Protruding from the arm of the jacket as though she has no hand at all is a wooden stick with a glitter-covered star and streamers attached to the end of it. She skips around her table twice, sits down, and is up again five seconds later, skipping in the opposite direction, her short hair bouncing up and down with every step.</p><p>My eyes move to the man whose jacket she\u2019s wearing. I blink, because the man is Graham. He tips his chin back, and the girl turns to look at me. They have the same dark eyes, same shape of mouth, but her hair is straight and strawberry blond, where his is wavy and dark, though I remember that in the sun it would be reddish. I remember, too, that Graham has two older sisters. This must be a niece.</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen him since last month, but I\u2019ve thought about him often since then. I smile, thinking what are the odds? I feel an uncharacteristic shyness with him, this guy I ran with nearly every morning while I was in Austin, shared aspects of my life that only Emily had been privy to before him. And then it was over.</p><p>I\u2019m struck then by the fact that I still don\u2019t know why he ever kissed me, or why he pulled away from me after. I assume he withdrew because of a relationship with Brooke, because of my very public kiss with Reid. Yet we became friends, apart from the two of them. Apart from that kiss in my room.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your latte,\u201d Dad says. He\u2019s balancing a slice of cheesecake on top of his coffee, taking advantage of being several thousand miles from Chloe\u2019s latest nutritional regimen. Spying the vacant table next to Graham, he makes a beeline for it.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Graham says when we sit.</p><p>\u201cHi. Dad, you remember Graham Douglas?\u201d Graham\u2019s niece stops circling the table and presses her face into his side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMr. Pierce,\u201d Graham says, reaching to shake Dad\u2019s hand while circling his opposite arm around the girl, who is now appraising me openly.</p><p>\u201cGraham, of course.\u201d Dad stirs sugar into his coffee. Sugar. Chloe would have a cow. \u201cAccording to Emma, you were the most talented actor in the School Pride cast. And she doesn\u2019t impress easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s interesting,\u201d Graham says with a smile. \u201cI thought she was the most talented.\u201d I could track the flush that spreads across my face.</p><p>Dad smiles at the girl as she spins the wand streamers in a blur of color. \u201cAnd who do we have here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is Cara.\u201d</p><p>My father leans his elbows on his knees. \u201cAre you a princess, Cara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a fairy godmother. See?\u201d She shucks off Graham\u2019s jacket to reveal flattened wings. \u201cOh, no! My wings are effed up!\u201d People at nearby tables turn and I bite my lip.</p><p>\u201cUm, that\u2019s the closest to not cursing my sister can seem to get in front of her.\u201d Graham shrugs, his lips twitching. \u201cLess shocking coming out of a four-year-old than the alternative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to fix them?\u201d I ask, and she stares at me for a long moment, contemplating how trustworthy I appear to be, I think, before scooting closer and turning around. I pull the translucent wings away from her tiny shoulder blades, reshaping the wire supports and admiring the silver glittered feathering. \u201cYour wings are beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>She nods. \u201cThey\u2019re magic.\u201d</p><p>I smile at her. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d She grabs her wand from the table. \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d I obey. \u201cNow make a wish.\u201d Into the emptiness of my mind, which hasn\u2019t made a genuine wish in a long time, comes one unambiguous thought. I want to see Graham again. Alone.</p><p>She touches the wand to my forehead; the ribbons tickle my nose. \u201cOkay. Your wish is granted.\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes, hear her asking Dad if he wants a wish, too. Graham watches me. \u201cWhatever it was, don\u2019t doubt her. Cara\u2019s wish-granting abilities are legendary.\u201d</p><p>I smile into my cup, swirling the remnants of foam and espresso.</p> <p>A minute later, Cara peers into my face, her small hands on my knees. \u201cWhat did you wish?\u201d She smells like chocolate, the evidence of which rims her upper lip.</p><p>\u201cI thought I wasn\u2019t supposed to tell.\u201d</p><p>She considers this for a moment. \u201cThen how can I make it come true?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but be struck by her logic. \u201cYou\u2019re a very astute fairy godmother, Cara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d She goes on a figure-eight trek around the two tables, stopping in front of me again. She chews her lower lip. \u201cWhat\u2019s asoot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAstute. It means you\u2019re very smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d she says again, without a hint of smugness. And then she turns to Graham with a random question, prefaced by a not-so-random title. \u201cDaddy, do I have to like broccoli?\u201d</p><p>Graham gazes at me over her head, absorbing my reaction, and there is nothing I can do to conceal my astonishment. I couldn\u2019t be more wide-eyed and dumbfounded.</p> <p>His eyes fall to her. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to like broccoli. There\u2019s lots of other green stuff to eat. But maybe you\u2019ll like it someday, when you're older.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkles her nose. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGraham must be older than he looks, to have a daughter that age,\u201d Dad says once we\u2019re in the taxi. Though I know Graham's exact age, I can\u2019t respond. I\u2019m still so in shock that I can barely focus. He never hinted at this. He returned home for that unspecified family emergency during filming, but that doesn\u2019t exactly say, I\u2019ve got a kid, does it?</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I cancel that dinner with Ted.\u201d He takes my hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll go do something together. We\u2019re in New York! You shouldn\u2019t be sitting alone in a hotel room; that\u2019s just crazy.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m going to be living here in a few months. I should start getting used to the idea of staying in occasionally, or I\u2019ll go bankrupt in a year. You never get to see Ted. Go out. I\u2019ve got this alone-in-a-hotel-room stuff down.\u201d</p><p>He sighs, looking out the window. \u201cCara reminds me of you at that age. Full of energy and ready to question everything, classify everything, using magic to make the world perfect. Now look at you\u2014in this city, visiting college campuses, redefining yourself. I\u2019m proud of you, Emma.\u201d</p><p>I lean my head on his shoulder, much as Cara did to Graham. \u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Forgiving him is easier now, so close to separation. We\u2019ve found each other again, and feeling bitter won\u2019t bring back the years we\u2019ve wasted. The years I hadn\u2019t verbalized my pain to him. The years he hadn\u2019t seen it in my eyes. What\u2019s done is done, and all that matters is where we go from here.</p><p>Chapter 46</p><p>REID</p><p>The premier of School Pride is next month, preceded by the inevitable red carpet events, talk show appearances and interviews. I\u2019ve seen enough of the final product to know it\u2019s good. In the date night genre, in the hopeless romantics genre, this movie will be hot.</p><p>It\u2019s over with Emma. I know this, but my brain hasn\u2019t completely accepted the fact. I keep running through everything I did wrong, looking for a way to repair the total clusterfuck of decisions I made that night. I shouldn\u2019t have let her out of my sight. I shouldn\u2019t have baited Brooke like that. And I sure as shit shouldn\u2019t have taken that girl back to the hotel.</p><p>Is it possible that I was in love with Emma? I don\u2019t know. Am I even capable of that emotion? I don\u2019t know that, either.</p><p>What I told her last month wasn\u2019t just a line to get her into bed. I\u2019d be lying if I said the companionship was more urgent than the attraction between us, but I enjoyed the afternoons she spent in my room after the surgery, when we hung out and watched movies or I played video games while she studied. I liked the comfort of just having her near. We didn\u2019t get a chance to discover what could have been, because in the end I treated her like every girl I\u2019ve ever come across.</p><p>Most girls who want me want the Bad Boy. That persona isn\u2019t just an act, it\u2019s who I am. There was never any possibility of me being anyone other than who I\u2019ve become, and maybe that\u2019s what Emma finally saw.</p><p>She said she wants someone who\u2019s already something better. Something better than me, obviously. She doesn\u2019t want to have to read between the lines to see who he is, or how he feels about her. As much as I wanted to be that guy, I don\u2019t have it in me. I am who I am.</p><p>Emma</p><p>Graham: I\u2019d like to talk to you. Alone. If you\u2019re willing to talk to me. Can i come to your hotel, or can we meet somewhere?</p><p>Me: When?</p><p>Graham: Now, if you want. Later tonight. Tomorrow.</p><p>Me: Now is good. Dad is out with a friend. I was going to order room service and watch movies.</p><p>Graham: Where are you?</p><p>Me: Soho grand</p><p>Graham: Be there in thirty minutes</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Graham says, for the second time today.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d As I pull the door open, it occurs to me that I\u2019m getting the wish Cara granted me.</p><p>He walks into the room as the door shuts with a snap and we pause feet apart. An old Switchfoot video plays in the background, the refrain flowing through the room like a private soundtrack. \u201cYou and your music videos,\u201d he smiles, running his fingers over the information folders from college visits that we\u2019ve left on top of the dresser. \u201cHave you decided on a school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. It\u2019s between those two.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cBoth have great programs. I guess you\u2019ll be moving to New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We\u2019ll go over everything when we get home. Make an informed decision.\u201d He nods again, but I know he didn\u2019t come to talk about my college plans, so I don\u2019t elaborate.</p><p>\u201cSo... I thought you might want an explanation. I\u2019m not sure where to begin.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re both quiet then. Everything about Graham, everything I thought I knew, all of it has tilted. My vision of him, my feelings for him, all still the same and yet nothing the same. His hands are balled into loose fists at his sides.</p><p>\u201cYou have a daughter.\u201d I have no right to the accusation in my voice. The last thing I want to do is make him feel interrogated, but he isn\u2019t talking, and the questions are crowding into my skull, knocking around, every one of them wanting an answer right now. \u201cI thought we were friends... so why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>He spreads his hands, \u201cI don\u2019t... tell people. Outside of my family, only Brooke knows, and a handful of friends from way back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you... are you... married?\u201d The concept is so foreign that the word comes out like something distasteful.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not, I wasn\u2019t. Cara\u2019s mother... she\u2019s never been in the picture. Not since Cara was born.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying to process this. Failing. It\u2019s like the puzzle box has the wrong illustration on the front, and as the pieces fit together, the image generated is something completely different than what I was expecting. \u201cHow did you... end up with her?\u201d</p><p>He walks across the small room and faces the window, silent. I give him time to gather his thoughts. Finally, he turns with his hands in his pockets. \u201cMy relationship with Cara\u2019s mother was over by the time she knew she was pregnant. She was considering her options, but she didn\u2019t want to keep her. And I just... I wanted her. The possibility of claiming her, of raising her, it gave me a purpose. I had to do it.\u201d</p><p>He takes a deep breath, runs a hand through his hair, staring at the carpet. \u201cI talked to my family. I was sixteen at the time, so there was no going it alone.\u201d When he raises his eyes, they\u2019re ablaze with resolve, and it\u2019s easy to picture the face his family had seen then. \u201cIf they hadn\u2019t been supportive, I don\u2019t know what would have happened. But I\u2019d made my decision, and they could see there was no changing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they agreed to help you?\u201d He nods. \u201cAnd then\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then I had to convince my ex-girlfriend to carry her to term, and give her to me.\u201d</p><p>I sit down on the bed, in a semi-state of shock. \u201cWow. I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>He sits next to me. \u201cYeah. That\u2019s the usual response.\u201d His hands grasp each other and he stares at them. \u201cThe family emergency, when I disappeared during filming? Cara had an asthma attack, and was hospitalized. I\u2019ve never been that scared.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d disappeared hours, maybe minutes, after he kissed me on my bed. He could have told me then, but he didn\u2019t trust me enough. \u201cWow, this is just... so awesome.\u201d I\u2019m grasping for words, wincing at my falsely joyful voice, but it\u2019s like if I stop talking I might hyperventilate. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re, you know, a father. Somebody calls you daddy. And that\u2019s just so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome?\u201d He\u2019s disappointed, or hurt, but at the same time, unsurprised. He\u2019s used to this reaction. \u201cAnyway, now you know everything.\u201d He stands up. \u201cListen, I\u2019ve got to, um, do a couple of errands. We can talk later, okay?\u201d I don\u2019t hear the likelihood of a later in his voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I follow him to the door, realizing that he just shared this really intimate thing with me, and I freaked out. He\u2019s standing in my room, my wish in solid form. \u201cGraham,\u201d I say gently. He turns, and I lay my hands on his chest, feel his heart hammering the same accelerated rhythm as my own. His dark eyes are sad, staring down at me.</p><p>My hand shaking, I reach up and push my fingers through the hair at his temple, pulling his head down. I kiss him, softly, carefully, and for a moment, he doesn\u2019t react at all, and I\u2019m sure that I\u2019ve read everything wrong... And then his mouth crushes into mine as his arms go all the way around me, pulling me to my toes.</p><p>I thought I\u2019d idealized kissing him, but his lips against mine now make that first kiss a distant echo. His hands skim up my sides and lace through my hair, turning me until my back is pressed against the wall and his body is pressing into mine, his heartbeat pounding under my hand. Pulling him against me, my arms draw him closer still, fingers kneading the hard muscles of his back, up and over his shoulders, down his arms and back again. When we break for air we\u2019re gasping, our chests rising and falling in unison as he leans into me and I arch into him, every physical indicator declaring I want you, I want you, I want you.</p><p>When he pushes away, I\u2019m confused. When I start to follow, blinking, he holds up a hand to stop me. \u201cEmma, I can\u2019t. This isn\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He turns and yanks the door open. Three seconds and he\u2019s gone. Lying back on the bed, I review every detail of what just happened, over and over, but it doesn\u2019t get any clearer. I almost call Emily, but don\u2019t. It\u2019s a rare night that she and Derek both have off, and I don\u2019t want to interrupt them with my problems. This is a riddle I need to figure out by myself. When Dad comes back later, clicking the television off and whispering my name as he pulls the comforter over me, I pretend to be asleep.</p><p>My puzzle is missing pieces. Not as many as it was missing earlier today, before we ran into Graham and Cara. But I know about her now; she\u2019s one less secret between us. What made him pull away? There must be someone else. Brooke? They were obviously still close last month. By his earlier admission, she\u2019s one of the few people who know about Cara. She could be the reason he withdrew after he kissed me in Austin, and again tonight.</p><p>The light-blocking draperies cloak the room in darkness, but I\u2019ve been half-reclining against the cushioned headboard and wide awake for two hours. My adjusted eyes distinguish the outlines of each piece of furniture, the mirror across the room, the shape of my shadowy reflection in it. I raise my hand and wave, and the ghostly mirror image waves back.</p><p>The drapes can\u2019t block the sounds of the city below. Unlike my periodic nights of insomnia in Sacramento, I\u2019m not awake and alone here, in the city that never sleeps; I\u2019m one of millions, like I already belong.</p><p>Dad snores softly in the other bed. I click the button on the side of my phone, the screen lighting up. 2:18 a.m. We\u2019re flying home in ten hours. I pull up Graham\u2019s number, click send message. The cursor blinks, waiting for me to type the message, and I sit there in the glow of the tiny screen. After thirty seconds, the display turns off. What do you say when the feelings don\u2019t fit into words? Finally, I type the message and hit send:</p> <p>Me: I\u2019m leaving today. I want to see you. I\u2019ll be in the lounge downstairs at 6 am.</p><p>There\u2019s no answer, and I feel discouraged and a little bit pathetic as the minutes tick by. As my eyes grow heavy, my grip on the phone loosens and I snuggle down under the covers, my phone under my pillow, the alarm set to 5:30 a.m.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, there are few people in the lounge this early on a Saturday. I request a booth in the back and wait, somehow sure he\u2019ll show, despite the fact that he never answered my text. Minutes later, he arrives, his hair falling over his forehead, still damp from a shower, a days\u2019 growth on his face and wearing jeans, boots I might see on a guy working the construction site down the street, and a faded t-shirt featuring another band I recognize from Emily raving about them.</p><p>He slides in across from me, his hands clenched on the table top. His gaze is direct, unlike yesterday\u2014when his eyes seemed to land anywhere rather than connect with mine.</p><p>A waitress steps up when he sits, and he orders coffee. At my nod he says, \u201cTwo, please.\u201d He sighs, fingers splayed on the table. \u201cLook. I\u2019m sorry I never told you about Cara. I thought about telling you a hundred times, and the longer I didn\u2019t, the harder it got to bring it up. I meant what I said about not really telling people about her. I\u2019ve led two lives for so long that it\u2019s habit, and until now I\u2019ve escaped combining them.\u201d</p><p>The waitress arrives with the coffee and he falls silent until she moves away.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for freaking out on you like that last night...\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI freaked out first.\u201d I stir a packet of sugar into my coffee as he pours cream into his.</p><p>\u201cYou had reason, I think.\u201d He grimaces into his coffee cup. \u201cCara is the most important thing in my life, a defining part of me. It was unfair of me, not telling you. When I took on the father gig, I didn\u2019t consider how it would affect future relationships. For years now, I\u2019ve kept my family on one side, and... almost everyone else on the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah...\u201d He breathes out a sigh, rolling my empty sugar packet into a ball. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>I breathe in, breathe out, clenching and unclenching my hands under the table. \u201cGraham. I\u2019ll be living here in four months. Maybe we can meet up for a run now and then. Or take Cara to the park, or whatever. I could babysit, if, you know, your family\u2019s busy and you want to go out. I\u2019d love to get to know her. Because... you mean a lot to me. And I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d Staring at the table top, I run my fingers over tiny grooves in the glossy surface. \u201cI miss our friendship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you want to be friends?\u201d he asks, and I look up at him. His hands are still, his expression serious. \u201cFriends, and that\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>The kiss last night. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t be friends. I was out of line last night. I understand how you feel about Brooke\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait. What about Brooke?\u201d he interrupts.</p><p>I swallow, my throat tight. \u201cUm. Your relationship with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy relationship with\u2014? Emma, Brooke is my friend. I know everything that happened with her... and him. She knows about Cara. We bonded years ago over parts of our lives that no one else we knew could relate to. She\u2019s a close friend. But a friend is all she\u2019s ever been, and all she\u2019ll ever be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you aren\u2019t in love?\u201d</p><p>He looks at me for a long moment. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I said I don\u2019t love Brooke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...\u201d There must be someone here in NYC. Someone else he\u2019s never told me about. This is like being bitten by dozens of mosquitoes. Like a scratchy tag on the inside back of a shirt. Like bamboo shoots pushed under your fingernails.</p><p>Not that I know about that last one.</p><p>\u201cAre you... over Reid?\u201d he asks then. \u201cThat night at the club, you were so upset.\u201d</p><p>Reid? I close my eyes and attempt to refocus. \u201cNo. I mean, yes, I\u2019m over him, but... that night, I was mostly messed up over a terrible fight I\u2019d had with Emily a week or so before.\u201d I open my eyes, stare into his. Talking to him is so easy, even now. \u201cWe\u2019ve been best friends since we were five, but we\u2019ve never said things to each other like that. We weren\u2019t speaking, and after everything happened with Brooke and Reid, I needed her. I wanted to call her, and I couldn\u2019t. I was afraid I\u2019d screwed up so bad that I\u2019d lost her forever.\u201d</p><p>He considers this. \u201cSo the whole week before that\u2014the \u2018allergies\u2019?\u201d</p><p>I knew he'd seen through that ruse. He must have thought I was upset over Reid. \u201cYeah. That was about Emily, too.\u201d</p><p>He scoots out of his booth and into mine, effectively blocking the two of us from view. His hand falls warm on my arm and it\u2019s not fair that he has no idea what he\u2019s doing to me. His dark eyes draw me in. Friendship with Graham is not going to work. Not when he\u2019s this close.</p><p>I fight to keep my voice light and level. \u201cThe girl you love\u2014is she someone I know?\u201d</p><p>His expression is full of wonder. \u201cEmma, you\u2019re the most imperceptive person ever, right behind me. Maybe both of us need straightforward facts. No ambiguity. Everything clear.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cClear is good.\u201d</p><p>He traces one finger down the side of my face. \u201cHow\u2019s this for clear,\u201d his voice is low and hollow as his fingertips brush over my lips. \u201cI haven\u2019t wanted anyone but you since the night we met. And as much as I value our friendship... being friends with you is not what I have in mind.\u201d Cupping my chin in his hand, he kisses me softly, the tip of his tongue skimming my lips, and when I open and kiss him back, it turns deep and possessive and full of promise and I forget where we are and I feel it to my toes and back.</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d I say, my thoughts swirling as he smiles and rests his forehead against mine, staring into my eyes like he\u2019s trying to read what I\u2019m thinking right through them.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I think I\u2019d prefer you keep that particular habit after all,\u201d he says, before he kisses me again. </p> </body></html>"]
