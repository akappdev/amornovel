Brynn Cassidy tried not to stare as he paraded past her and slouched down in the desk in the farthest corner of the classroom. His nose was decorated with a safety pin. The fact that his hair was cut in a Mohawk style and dyed orange shouldn\u2019t faze her. She\u2019d been told what to expect.</p><p>Manhattan High School wasn\u2019t St. Mary Academy, the parochial girls\u2019 high school where she\u2019d taught for the last two years. But teaching here was an opportunity she couldn\u2019t let pass her by. She\u2019d accepted this position to test her theories and gain experience in dealing with students from a disadvantaged neighborhood.</p><p>Next, a young lady entered the room in a miniskirt, blouse and no bra. Her hair, pitch-black and stringy, covered her far better than her choice of outfits. She glanced around, shrugged, and claimed the seat closest to the door as if it were important to make a fast getaway.</p> <p>The room filled quickly. The school building itself was said to be dilapidated and run-down, but that didn\u2019t trouble Brynn. St. Mary Academy was a turn-of-the-century structure with high ceilings and lovely polished wood floors that smelled of lemon oil.</p><p>When Brynn learned Manhattan High in the Washington Heights area had been constructed in the early 1950s, she\u2019d expected it to be an improvement, but she was wrong. Like so many other schools, Manhattan High had been forced to make some difficult budget choices. Thanks to three failed school bond levies, modernizing the classrooms was on the low end of the priority list.</p><p>\u201cWill everyone kindly take a seat,\u201d Brynn instructed nervously. She stood in front of the class and was ignored, which wasn\u2019t surprising since the bell had yet to ring.</p><p>Looking for something constructive to do, she walked over to the badly chipped blackboard and wrote out her name.</p><p>The bell rang, and several of the kids stopped talking long enough to indicate their irritation at being interrupted. The level of conversation increased once the bell finished.</p> <p>Brynn returned to the front center of the room and waited. She\u2019d learned early in her teaching career never to outshout her students. It only made her look foolish, and it didn\u2019t work. After five full minutes of being ignored, she went to the wall and flipped the light switch a couple of times. This technique had worked elsewhere but had only a mild effect upon the class. The level of talking decreased momentarily while several glanced her way, then quickly continued their ongoing conversations.</p><p>Brynn decided she had no option but to wait them out. It demanded the longest fifteen minutes of her life to stand in front of that classroom until thirty people voluntarily gave her their attention.</p><p>It might have taken longer if the boy, Hispanic from the look of him, hadn\u2019t raised his right hand and snapped his fingers. Ten or so other Hispanics stopped talking and turned around on their seats. An African American followed suit, and several of the others clustered together went silent.</p><p>The class had divided itself along ethnic lines, Brynn noted. The Hispanics sat in the front, the African Americans chose the back.</p><p>Once silence reigned, Brynn stepped forward. \u201cGood morning,\u201d she said with her brightest smile. \u201cMy name\u2019s Miss Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy ain\u2019t you married?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not,\u201d she answered simply, preferring not to get trapped in a conversation about herself. \u201cI\u2019m your teacher, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re new, ain\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Brynn answered politely. \u201cAs you already know, we\u2019re involved in an experimental program called Interdisciplinary Learning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like something a nice girl like you should be teaching,\u201d one of the boys called out.</p><p>Despite herself, Brynn smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ll be spending three hours together each afternoon, exploring senior English, world history, and social science. You\u2019ll notice how the classes are grouped along parallel lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she speaking English?\u201d one girl whispered loudly, leaning toward another.</p><p>Brynn decided it would be best to explain the concept in simpler terms. \u201cThe classes we\u2019ll be studying are connected by subject. We\u2019ll read The Diary of Anne Frank for the English portion, the history section will involve the study of World War Two, and in the last part of the session I\u2019d like to discuss the justification for war and other value clarification.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll three hours will be spent with you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Brynn said. \u201cYou\u2019ll know me better than any other teacher, and by the same token, I\u2019ll know you. I\u2019d like it if we could work together as a team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to be spending this much time with one teacher, then it only seems right that you tell us something about yourself first,\u201d the Hispanic boy who\u2019d quieted the class said. Since she owed him a favor, she agreed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long you been teaching?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my third year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she lasts the first week,\u201d someone suggested under their breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll last,\u201d Brynn assured them. \u201cI\u2019m too young to retire and too stubborn to quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhode Island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you decide to teach here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a fool, that\u2019s why,\u201d someone answered for her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Brynn countered. \u201cAs I explained earlier, we\u2019re involved in an experimental program that\u2019s being sponsored by the federal government. I was asked to participate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do it?\u201d</p><p>The questions were making her decidedly uncomfortable. \u201cPart of the agreement would be that a portion of my student loan would be forgiven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgiven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the word the government used.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you teach before?\u201d a Chinese girl asked, her gaze shyly meeting Brynn\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSt. Mary Academy. It\u2019s a private school for girls near Rochester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLa de da,\u201d one of the boys said in a high-pitched voice. He stood, dropped his wrists, and pranced around his desk.</p><p>\u201cHey, could you set me up with one of those nice Catholic girls?\u201d</p><p>Brynn didn\u2019t bother to answer.</p><p>\u201cDo you color your hair or is it naturally red?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s auburn,\u201d Brynn corrected, \u201cand it\u2019s as natural as it comes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, dummy, with a name like Cassidy? She\u2019s Irish, can\u2019t you tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDummy?\u201d Brynn repeated, and then added in a Home Alone voice, \u201cI don\u2019t think so. If he were dumb, he wouldn\u2019t be a high school senior. This brings up something I consider vital to this class. Respect. I won\u2019t tolerate any name calling, racial slurs, or put-downs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou been in girls\u2019 school too long, Teach. That\u2019s just the way we talk. If Malcolm here wants to call Denzil a nigger, he\u2019s got a right \u2019cause he\u2019s a nigger himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in this classroom he won\u2019t. The only thing I\u2019ll ask of you in the way of deportment is mutual respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know you, how am I supposed to respect you?\u201d</p><p>It was a good question and one Brynn couldn\u2019t slough off.</p><p>\u201cEspecially if the only reason you decided to take this job was so you could be forgiven for something you did to the government.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the only reason I took the job,\u201d Brynn pressed, \u201cI want to teach you to dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d A girl with her hair woven into tiny braids all over her head sat upright. \u201cYou\u2019re making us sound like babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting naps,\u201d Brynn explained. \u201cHow many of you know what you\u2019re going to do after you graduate from high school?\u201d</p><p>One hand went up, from the same Hispanic youth who\u2019d helped her earlier.</p><p>\u201cYour name is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmilio Alcantara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Emilio. Tell me what your dreams are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got plenty of those. I dream about Michelle and Nikki and . . .\u201d His friends made several catcalls, and Brynn smiled and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about the future. After high school, five years down the road. We all need a dream, something to pin our hopes on, something that gives us a reason to wake up in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean a dream like Martin Luther King?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said enthusiastically. \u201cAn ambition to do something, travel somewhere, or be something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The boy who asked had caught her attention earlier. He seemed indifferent to everything that was going on around him. A couple of the kids had said something to him, but he\u2019d ignored them as if they weren\u2019t there or, more appropriately, as if he weren\u2019t entirely there himself. Briefly she wondered if he were on drugs.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Brynn repeated. \u201cBecause dreaming is a necessary part of life, like eating or sleeping. Sometimes we just forget about it, is all. We\u2019ll be exploring more about this later, but I guarantee you one thing, by the end of this quarter, there\u2019ll be plenty for you to think and dream about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d said the girl who\u2019d claimed the desk closest to the door, \u201cyou might be all right, but it\u2019s going to take some doing, getting used to a teacher who doesn\u2019t look any older than one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t married, either. Say, Teach, do you want me to set you up?\u201d Emilio asked. \u201cI got an older brother who could use a chick like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but no thanks,\u201d Brynn answered, reaching for her attendance book. \u201cNow that you know about me, it\u2019s time for me to learn something about each one of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we don\u2019t know you!\u201d two or three protested in turn.</p><p>Brynn held the book against her breast and sighed. \u201cWhat other information do you need?\u201d</p><p>Questions were tossed at her in every which direction. She put a stop to them with a wave of her hand. \u201cListen, I\u2019ll give you the basics and then we\u2019ll have to get started. My first name is Brynn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many kids in your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Irish and Catholic, ain\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Brynn ignored the comment. \u201cI\u2019m the fourth oldest and the first girl. My oldest brother is thirty-three and my youngest sister is sixteen.\u201d She lowered the grade book and called out, \u201cYolanda Aguilar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d The Hispanic girl raised her hand and waved enthusiastically.</p><p>Brynn looked at Yolanda and made a notation next to the girl\u2019s name. \u201cEmilio Alcantara is here,\u201d she said, making a second notation.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you writing down about me?\u201d Emilio demanded. He sat up on his chair and craned his neck toward her as if that would be enough to read what she\u2019d written.</p><p>\u201cI said you sat in the front row and revealed leadership characteristics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d He sounded surprised.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you say about me?\u201d Yolanda asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat you\u2019re energetic and personable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, how\u2019d you figure that about Yolanda?\u201d another boy demanded, then leaned over to the student at the desk next to him. \u201cWhat\u2019s personable mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh, I\u2019m next and I want to know what she\u2019s gonna say about me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cModesto Diaz,\u201d Brynn called out, looking at the youth above the grade book.</p><p>He curled his upper lip and snarled at her. \u201cYo.\u201d</p><p>Brynn added her comment to the book.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d ya say?\u201d Modesto insisted, straightening. He was halfway out of his seat. \u201cI gotta right to know since you told the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wrote down that you have a flair for the dramatic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that mean?\u201d Modesto asked Emilio under his breath.</p><p>\u201cThe hell if I know,\u201d Emilio complained. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna be one weird teacher.\u201d</p><p>By lunchtime Brynn was convinced Emilio was right. She was completely out of touch with their world. Her vocabulary, which she\u2019d never thought of as especially advanced, served to confuse her students. Half the morning was spent repeating in simpler terms what she\u2019d said previously.</p><p>She\u2019d no more than handed out The Diary of Anne Frank and briefly described to them Anne\u2019s story when the bell rang for their first break. The classroom emptied so fast, one would think the school was on fire.</p><p>Brynn sat down at her desk and exhaled sharply, weary to the bone. This was her first day in an inner-city high school, and she was going to need help\u2014lots of help, and she didn\u2019t expect it to come in the form of the PTA.</p><p>Bowing her head, she murmured a simple prayer, asking for patience and guidance. She yearned to teach her students to dream, to look to the future with enthusiasm. She hungered for them to see beyond the troubles they faced day in and day out and reach for the stars, and she wanted to be the one to show them the way.</p> <p>Brynn\u2019s whispered prayer fluttered past the chipped blackboard, echoed silently through the scarred halls, as it winged its way toward heaven. The request soared, swiftly spanning the distance between man and God. Carried on the brisk winds of faith, guided by devotion, navigated by love, it arrived fresh and bright at the very feet of the Archangel Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cBrynn Cassidy,\u201d Gabriel repeated slowly as he flipped through the cumbersome book, marking the entry. He was writing when he glanced up to find Shirley, Goodness, and Mercy standing directly across the desk from him. He\u2019d never seen the three look more\u2014he hated the term\u2014angelic. Their wings were neatly folded in place and they smiled serenely as if the world were at their feet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that time of year again,\u201d Goodness reminded him, grinning broadly.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s hand tightened around the quill pen. Heaven help him, he was going to be left to deal with these three lovable troublemakers once more.</p><p>\u201cTime of year for what?\u201d he asked. Gabriel was playing dumb in a stalling effort. For the past two years this trio of prayer ambassadors had visited earth, working their own unique brand of miracles. A sort of divine intervention run amuck.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d like to try our hand in the Big Apple,\u201d Mercy explained with limited patience. It was apparent she was eager to get her assignment and be on her way. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking forward to working together again,\u201d she reminded him primly. \u201cOne would assume that with the success of the past two years we\u2019d have proven ourselves beyond question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t mean to be impertinent,\u201d Goodness inserted, glaring at her fellow prayer ambassador, \u201cbut I find myself agreeing with Mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrynn Cassidy,\u201d Shirley repeated softly, reading over Gabriel\u2019s shoulder.</p> <p>Gabriel deliberately closed the huge book, cutting off Shirley\u2019s view. The last thing he needed was for the former guardian angel to take a hankering for this particular assignment.</p><p>The students of Manhattan High would require a far more experienced angel than Shirley. Why, her tender heart would be mush by the end of a week, working with this group of adolescents. Frankly, Gabriel didn\u2019t expect Brynn Cassidy to last long herself.</p><p>Gabriel knew all about the young teacher. Her mother and grandfather had been praying for her for several years. As far as Gabriel was concerned, Brynn Cassidy was far more suited to teaching the proper young ladies of St. Mary Academy. Manhattan High was a graveyard of lost souls. An unseen storm cloud had settled over the school, feeding on tears yet to be shed and broken promises. Brynn\u2019s humble faith was like a newborn lamb placed in the midst of ravenous wolves. She\u2019d quickly be devoured. Naturally Gabriel would do what he could to aid her, but one ill-equipped prayer ambassador would hardly be sufficient.</p><p>\u201cBrynn needs me,\u201d Shirley said, looking him squarely in the eye.</p><p>\u201cShe needs an army. I don\u2019t mean to discourage you,\u201d Gabriel said, feeling mildly guilty, \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find a more appropriate assignment for you. A less complicated request,\u201d he muttered more to himself than to Shirley.</p><p>As he recalled, a prayer request had come in that morning from a teenage girl in Boston who needed a date for prom night. Surely Shirley could scrounge up a decent young man. As for Goodness and Mercy, why, there were any number of less demanding requests with which to occupy them.</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute,\u201d he said, flipping through the unwieldy book, finding a page, and running his index finger down the large number of entries. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll come up with something appropriate for each of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo arguments?\u201d Goodness asked, her eyes wide with surprise.</p><p>\u201cWow, maybe we have proven ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to Goodness about Hannah Morganstern,\u201d Gabriel said, his brow creased with contemplation.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Goodness answered excitedly.</p><p>\u201cHer family owns one of the most popular delis in all of New York,\u201d the Archangel went on to explain.</p><p>Goodness and Mercy looked at each other and squealed with delight. The two joined hands and danced a happy jig around his desk, kicking up their heels.</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Mercy asked, breathless with excitement.</p><p>\u201cJenny Lancaster,\u201d Gabriel said decisively. \u201cShe moved to New York from Custer, Montana, three years ago, hoping to make a name for herself on Broadway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gabriel said with a sigh of regret. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go home, only she can\u2019t bear to face that. You see, she doesn\u2019t want to disappoint her family, and I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s stretched the truth and told them things that weren\u2019t altogether true. You\u2019re going to have to help her make the decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout moving the Statue of Liberty?\u201d Gabriel demanded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kid stuff,\u201d Goodness muttered.</p><p>\u201cMaybe so, but is Rockefeller Center safe?\u201d</p><p>The two found little humor in his question. It was then that Gabriel noticed that Shirley had disappeared.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Shirley?\u201d</p><p>Goodness and Mercy glanced over their shoulders. \u201cI haven\u2019t a clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see her leave.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel had a sneaking suspicion he already knew where the prayer ambassador had disappeared to. \u201cWait here,\u201d he instructed impatiently. He raised his massive arms and with one wide, sweeping motion parted the clouds of heaven and descended from paradise to the mundane world.</p><p>He found Shirley right where he suspected: in an inner-city classroom, keeping a close watch on a young, inexperienced schoolteacher.</p><p>Brynn finished her lunch and poured herself a cup of coffee. Standing at the window, she looked out over the concrete jungle that made up the city.</p><p>St. Philip\u2019s, the cathedral located across the street, had once been the pride of the diocese. The stained-glass windows, depicting the Stations of the Cross, had aged badly over the years. A flight of concrete steps led to the eight-foot-tall double doors. The church was a magnificent piece of Gothic architecture, but like Manhattan High, it had fallen upon harsh economic times.</p><p>When Brynn had first been approached about this assignment, she\u2019d visited New York City and loved it. There was a rhythm to the city, a musical beat that had set her heart to racing.</p><p>In her mind\u2019s eye came a picture of prosperity and abundance. Not of wealth or riches in the monetary sense, but of purpose. The feeling had stayed with her in the days that followed, and when she\u2019d penned her name to the contract, Brynn had felt instinctively that she was doing the right thing.</p><p>Following the break, Brynn headed down the crowded hallway. Several students leaned against their lockers in passionate embraces. This was a foreign element to Brynn, since she\u2019d attended a parochial girls\u2019 high school as well as taught in one. It was a bit of a shock to discover how friendly students were allowed to get in the school hallway.</p><p>A ruckus broke out at the end of the corridor, and several heated words in Spanish flew at her like fiery darts. Brynn\u2019s knowledge of the language was limited, but she was well aware the two boys weren\u2019t exchanging pleasantries.</p><p>After making her way to the problem, she found Emilio Alcantara and an African American she didn\u2019t know staring each other down. A crowd had circled around the two.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem here?\u201d Brynn asked, maneuvering into the tight circle.</p><p>\u201cIf you know what\u2019s good for you, Teach, you\u2019d better leave,\u201d Emilio advised.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that, and now I suggest you two boys give it up and go about your business. Fighting isn\u2019t going to solve anything.\u201d</p><p>The black boy looked at her with such unadulterated hatred that for a wild second Brynn was caught speechless. She\u2019d never had a student, or anyone else, look at her in quite that way.</p><p>A shiver ran up her spine when she noticed both boys had knives. She grabbed Suzie Chang, the shy girl from her class, by the shoulder. \u201cGet help immediately,\u201d she ordered, her heart in her throat.</p><p>Suzie took off running.</p><p>By then the Hispanic youths had lined one side of the hallway and the blacks dominated the second half. The two ethnic groups glared at one another, waiting for an excuse, any excuse, to fight. The atmosphere was explosive, the tension as tightly strung as a fiddle.</p><p>Without thinking, Brynn positioned herself between the two boys. Her head was spinning and she felt lightheaded with fear. \u201cStop,\u201d she ordered in her most authoritative voice, but the request sounded hollow even to her own ears.</p><p>The sound of footsteps running toward her was so welcome, Brynn nearly collapsed with relief. A male teacher and a janitor exploded onto the scene, and the knives disappeared as if by magic. Emilio and the other youth looked as if they were the best of friends.

A second male teacher appeared to escort the other boy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna be suspended,\u201d Emilio said, glaring at her as if she\u2019d turned traitor on him. \u201cI thought you were different,\u201d he spat out. \u201cYou ain\u2019t no different than any of the other teachers.\u201d His dark eyes, leveled at her, were filled with animosity.</p> <p>\u201cListen here, Emilio, it wasn\u2019t me who got involved in an altercation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what? You know, if you\u2019re going to teach English, the least you could do is learn to speak it first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fight,\u201d she said, losing her patience. She was half trotting in order to keep up with Doug\u2019s long-legged stride. Her fellow teacher was making haste for Mr. Whalen\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cYou know the rules about knives on school property,\u201d Doug told Emilio.</p><p>\u201cWhat knife?\u201d the youth demanded. \u201cShe was seeing things. I didn\u2019t have any knife, and neither did Grover, ain\u2019t that right, bro?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe new teach needs glasses,\u201d Grover claimed, sounding as if they\u2019d been strolling through a bed of wildflowers.</p><p>\u201cTell him, Miss Cassidy,\u201d Emilio said, staring at her. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any sign of knives, now, was there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you expect me to lie on your behalf, I won\u2019t do it,\u201d Brynn told him in no uncertain terms. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re both expelled, then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be suspended for three days,\u201d Doug interrupted.</p><p>\u201cThen you have no one to blame but yourselves,\u201d she finished.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t coming back,\u201d Grover announced in chilling tones. \u201cSchool ain\u2019t gonna help me or my homies. I\u2019m outta here, understand?\u201d He jerked his elbow free from the teacher and strolled out the door, letting it slam in his wake.</p> <p>\u201cGood riddance,\u201d the man murmured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to him,\u201d Brynn said, going after Grover.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t taken two steps when Doug Keast stopped her. \u201cLet him go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right. Grover\u2019s nothing but bad news.\u201d Doug looked to Emilio as if to suggest the Hispanic boy fell into the same category.</p><p>\u201cEmilio\u2019s different,\u201d Brynn insisted. \u201cGrover\u2019s choosing to give up, to fail. Emilio\u2019s got a future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Emilio muttered, pulling himself free of Doug\u2019s hold. \u201cSome future. First you tell me what a great leader I am and then you get me kicked out of school.\u201d Having made that little speech, he slumped down on the worn vinyl sofa outside Mr. Whalen\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cDid you see the knives?\u201d Gabriel asked Shirley gently. \u201cThey were real, and the risk to Brynn is equally grave. She could have been seriously hurt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe woman\u2019s in profound need of heavenly intervention,\u201d Shirley said forcefully. \u201cIn other words, this teacher needs me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh . . .\u201d Gabriel hated to be the one to break the news, but Shirley was out of her league. He\u2019d hoped the prayer ambassador would see it for herself, but now he wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d Shirley said, eager to prove herself. \u201cYou think I\u2019m in way over my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thoughts were running along those lines,\u201d Gabriel admitted.</p><p>\u201cI believe I could help Brynn,\u201d Shirley insisted, and then stiffened her shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re the one in charge of handling the prayer assignments, and I have no option but to accept your decision, but I want to help Brynn Cassidy teach her students to dream. I want to stand at her side when their eyes light up with discovery, and I especially long to be there when she tells them about faith in God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are other teachers who need you,\u201d Gabriel assured her. \u201cAnd they aren\u2019t trapped in a poor neighborhood school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Shirley whispered, hanging her head in defeat.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps another year,\u201d Gabriel suggested.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d The word was so low, it dragged against the floor.</p><p>Gently patting the discouraged angel on her shoulder, Gabriel escorted her back to heaven, where Goodness and Mercy awaited their return.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find another assignment for Shirley in a moment,\u201d he promised, \u201cbut first, I want to introduce Goodness to Hannah Morganstern.\u201d</p><p>Two</p><p>\u201cHannah who?\u201d Goodness asked, looking puzzled.</p><p>\u201cMorganstern,\u201d Gabriel supplied. \u201cThe prayer request came in from Hannah\u2019s mother and grandmother. They want her to make a good marriage.\u201d He opened the cumbersome book that listed the incoming prayer requests and smoothly folded back the page. Running his index finger down a list of names, he paused when he located Hannah\u2019s.</p><p>Gabriel smiled, pleased with himself. This request would be a simple matter and would quickly appease the novice prayer ambassador. The sooner Goodness was back where she belonged, the better for all concerned.</p><p>As it happened, Hannah was close to becoming engaged to Carl Rabinsky, the rabbi\u2019s son. Carl was a fine, upstanding young man with a bright future.</p><p>Hannah\u2019s family was delighted that their daughter had chosen such an outstanding marriage candidate. A professional matchmaker couldn\u2019t have come up with a better choice. Goodness would soon recognize how advantageous such a marriage would be for Hannah. Naturally the prayer ambassador would accept full credit for the match, which was fine with Gabriel as long as she left well enough alone.</p><p>By his best estimate, Gabriel would have Goodness out of harm\u2019s way within a day or two. Heaven knew he wouldn\u2019t rest until all three were back where they belonged. There was no telling the trouble they could rouse in the Big Apple. Gabriel cringed involuntarily at the thought of Shirley, Goodness, and Mercy loose on the unsuspecting souls of New York City.</p><p>They did try. He\u2019d give them that much. The three angels were dear hearts, but frankly they were trouble with a capital T. There was no end to the mischief they managed to muster each Christmas. The season was hectic enough without having to deal with those three.</p><p>\u201cWhen can I see Hannah?\u201d Goodness asked eagerly.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to tell me more about Jenny Lancaster?\u201d Mercy asked, crowding her way between him and Goodness. The smallest of the three juggled her elbows until she\u2019d jockeyed herself into position. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to meeting Jenny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my turn,\u201d Goodness reminded her friend sternly.</p><p>\u201cBe patient,\u201d Gabriel advised the two. At times he felt like a referee at a hockey match. \u201cGoodness, let me take you down to meet Hannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to come,\u201d Mercy insisted.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Shirley was determined not to be left behind.</p><p>Gabriel hadn\u2019t planned on making an expedition out of this. He\u2019d thought it would be a simple matter to point out Hannah to Goodness, then introduce her to Carl. They\u2019d be back before either of Goodness\u2019s friends had time to miss her. He was about to reassure Mercy and Shirley of this when he noticed that the three had looped their arms together. They stood before him with a determination that would have shook Moses before that unfortunate incident on Mt. Sinai.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d he grumbled under his breath. These particular prayer ambassadors had a way about them that foiled him at every turn. Only this year, he was simplifying matters. Their assignments were all straightforward requests that would bring them back to heaven in record time. Nothing complicated. Nothing involved. Assignments each one should be able to arrange in record time. This Christmas, Gabriel promised himself, wouldn\u2019t be like the past two.</p><p>Stepping away from the others, the archangel raised his massive arms and with one sure movement parted the massive clouds of heaven. A thin layer of mist remained, and gradually he was able to make out the earth below. Soon the four of them narrowed in on the big city. Skyscrapers punctured the sky. The top floors of the twin towers of the World Trade Center came clearly into focus. Then he viewed the landmark Brooklyn Bridge, followed by Times Square.</p><p>\u201cThis is New York City?\u201d Goodness breathed in awe.</p><p>\u201cMy heavens, what\u2019s that?\u201d Mercy asked, pointing to the street below.</p><p>Gabriel grinned. His timing couldn\u2019t have been better. They\u2019d arrived in time to witness Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day parade. A giant balloon replica of a popular comic-strip dog floated far above the street, steered by several silly-looking adults dressed in elf costumes.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like some kind of parade,\u201d Shirley answered before he had a chance to explain.</p><p>A marching band, the trombone players with their instruments aiming skyward, blared a lively rendition of an easily recognizable Christmas ditty. A fierce pounding of drums added to the excitement of the music.</p><p>\u201cThis is wonderful,\u201d Goodness said, and spread-eagled herself across the top of a blossom-laden float. Six men dressed as toy soldiers stood guard over an open treasure chest filled with a variety of brightly wrapped gifts in gold and silver paper.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to meet Hannah,\u201d Gabriel reminded her, hiding a smile. Goodness\u2019s eyes were as round as a two-year-old child\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cIn a minute,\u201d Goodness told him. It was apparent she was more interested in watching the parade than in meeting her young charge.</p><p>With a stiff-kneed walk, one of the toy soldiers marched to the end of the float. A fairy princess appeared, with dainty wings strapped to her back, and scooped up handfuls of candy. Smiling, she tossed them into the cheering crowd.</p><p>\u201cYou call those wings?\u201d Mercy asked on a disdainful note.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to meet Hannah Morganstern,\u201d Gabriel felt obligated to remind the three.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d Goodness announced, reluctantly tearing herself away from the dazzling scene.</p><p>\u201cIf we must,\u201d Mercy added with a decided lack of enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Brynn Cassidy\u2019s here?\u201d Shirley\u2019s gaze scanned the thick crowds that crammed the cement sidewalks. \u201cWhat about the kids from the school? They\u2019d come, wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to meet Hannah, remember?\u201d Gabriel reminded Shirley. He should have known it would be a mistake to bring the others. \u201cThere\u2019s Hannah now,\u201d he said in an effort to divert their attention. He motioned toward a group of parade watchers standing along Central Park West.</p><p>\u201cHannah\u2019s the petite woman with the blue angel scarf tied around her neck.\u201d Gabriel had a soft spot in his heart when it came to the gentle Jewish woman. She reminded him of Rebecca, the young woman God had chosen for Abraham\u2019s only son.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s lovely.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel agreed. \u201cHannah\u2019s the only child, born later in life to a devoted couple. Ruth Morganstern prayed faithfully for many years for a daughter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLeah Lundberg did the same,\u201d Mercy reminded Gabriel. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why God makes some couples wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for us to question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Mercy agreed, \u201cHis timing is always perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting back to Hannah,\u201d Gabriel tried again. \u201cThe Morgansterns have raised their daughter well. They couldn\u2019t be more proud of her, and rightly so. Hannah is well loved by many.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you mind if Shirley and I entertain ourselves for a few moments?\u201d Mercy asked, and her eyes twinkled with mischief. Gabriel noticed the angel was staring at the reader board above Times Square.</p><p>\u201cYou can go on without us,\u201d Shirley insisted.</p><p>\u201cNo way. Listen, you two. Shirley . . . Mercy,\u201d Gabriel stuttered, wanting to stop them before they vanished. Unfortunately he was too late. He clenched his jaw and turned to Goodness.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a thing to worry about,\u201d Goodness assured him. \u201cThey can take care of themselves.\u201d</p><p>That was what Gabriel was afraid of.</p> <p>He was about to go after Mercy and Shirley himself when Goodness tugged at his sleeve. \u201cTell me what you know about Hannah Morganstern. You said her mother and grandmother are looking for Hannah to make a good marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he muttered. He would need his wits to make this assignment sound more difficult than it was.</p><p>\u201cWell, if that\u2019s the case,\u201d Goodness muttered, her shoulders heaving with a deliberate sigh, \u201cI certainly hope she isn\u2019t interested in the young man she\u2019s with. It\u2019s perfectly obvious they aren\u2019t the least bit suited.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s attention went back to the street corner where he\u2019d last seen Hannah.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Carl Rabinsky?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cJust look.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCarl, couldn\u2019t we please stay a bit longer?\u201d Hannah asked. She pleaded with him with her eyes, hoping she could find a way to change his mind. Carl had agreed to attend the Thanksgiving Day parade with her, but they\u2019d barely arrived and already he was anxious to leave. She knew he was having trouble with the headmaster at the Hebrew academy where he taught and had been preoccupied most of the day.</p><p>\u201cTen minutes more, then,\u201d Carl conceded indulgently. His gloved hand squeezed hers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I told you earlier that this just isn\u2019t my thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Hannah was grateful he\u2019d consented to come. She only wished he could enjoy the festivities as much as she did. Hannah found the merrymaking contagious\u2014the children, the excitement, the wonderful silliness that surrounded this time of year.</p><p>\u201cOh, Carl, look,\u201d she said, pointing toward the huge float making its way down the wide street. \u201cIt\u2019s a scene from the Nutcracker Suite.\u201d</p><p>Carl smiled tolerantly and pointedly glanced at his watch. \u201cFive more minutes,\u201d he announced under his breath. \u201cIf you want to see more of the parade, you can watch it on television.\u201d</p><p>Television. Never. Hannah refused to allow his stick-in-the-mud attitude to spoil her fun. Standing on the tips of her toes, she peered down the bustling street, hoping to catch a glimpse of what was coming next. The distinct tones of an approaching band floated toward her.</p><p>Unable to see, she edged her way into the crowd until she was wedged against the waist-high barrier to the street. She stayed there until the marching musicians passed, applauding their efforts. The tall, distinguished-looking man standing next to her whistled boisterously. Hannah looked up at him and smiled warmly. Their eyes met, and he returned the friendly gesture.</p><p>The man looked vaguely familiar, but then it wasn\u2019t uncommon for Hannah to see someone she thought she knew. Working in the family-owned, kosher-style deli, she met literally hundreds of people on a daily basis.</p> <p>His eyes were a deep, rich shade of coffee brown. They sparkled with delight as he looked down at her. He had a kind face, appealing but not particularly handsome. His hair needed to be trimmed, but that gave him a rumble-tumble look that she found endearing. It was apparent he was some kind of businessman; she could tell that much from the way he dressed and the way he stood. Besides, if he frequented her parents\u2019 deli, then chances were he worked in one of the office buildings close by.</p><p>\u201cDo I know you?\u201d he asked, frowning slightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Hannah Morganstern,\u201d she said. \u201cMost people recognize me from my parents\u2019 deli.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Your father serves the best pastrami in town.\u201d He held out his hand to her. \u201cI\u2019m Joshua Shadduck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Joshua.\u201d The noise level made it difficult to carry on a conversation.</p><p>They shook hands, and Hannah glanced over her shoulder, looking for Carl. He wasn\u2019t there. She scanned the crowd once more, certain he wouldn\u2019t have left her intentionally. Carl would never do that, yet he was nowhere in sight. Anxious now, she stood on her tiptoes and looked around.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d she whispered, and bit into her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Joshua lowered his head close to her so she could hear him.</p><p>\u201cMy friend. I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve gotten separated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat happens in crowds like these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but . . .\u201d She continued to study the huge throng. The crowd was moving, milling about. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to leave him behind.\u201d Carl would be worried and flustered. If she ever hoped to talk him into attending another parade, he\u2019d be sure to remind her of this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you look,\u201d Joshua offered.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that.\u201d She was the one to blame. If she hadn\u2019t been so impatient to see what was ahead, she wouldn\u2019t have lost Carl.</p><p>\u201cTell me what he looks like,\u201d Joshua suggested. Since he was head and shoulders taller than she, his chances of finding Carl were far better than her own.</p><p>\u201cLet me think,\u201d she mumbled. She went with the most obvious: his clothing. \u201cHe had on a black wool overcoat.\u201d</p><p>Joshua leveled his eyes on her, amusement bracketing the sides of his mouth. \u201cHannah, every man here has on a black wool overcoat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes . . . I know. He\u2019s five ten or so, and . . . he\u2019s probably frowning. He only came because I wanted to see the parade, and he\u2019s probably annoyed with me for disappearing like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA frowning man, five ten, in a black wool overcoat.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met once more, and for no reason Hannah could explain, they both started laughing.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably given up on me and left,\u201d she conceded, and glanced longingly over her shoulder, not wanting to miss the rest of the parade. \u201cI should probably go back myself,\u201d she said with regret.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Your friend can find his own way home, can\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d he urged. His hand cupped her elbow, his touch light and encouraging. His eyes smiled with warmth and pleasure, something she\u2019d found sadly lacking in Carl. Her friend had only tolerated the merriment. Macy\u2019s parade was one more thing Carl considered frivolous and impractical. He often mentioned the overwhelming cost of such a production. To Carl\u2019s way of thinking, this money would be better spent feeding the hungry or aiding the homeless.</p><p>Hannah had no argument to offer. The parade would go on no matter how wasteful Carl found it to be, and she could see no reason not to enjoy it.</p><p>\u201cOh, look,\u201d she said, pointing down the street at the oncoming float. She glanced at Joshua and discovered that he viewed the winter festival creation with the same keen enjoyment and wonder that she did.</p><p>One lazy snowflake drifted down from the lead gray sky. Another soon followed.</p><p>\u201cSnow!\u201d Delighted, Hannah held up her hand to catch a fluffy flake. It melted in the palm of her hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect conclusion to the parade, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Joshua asked. Pressed against him as she was, Hannah couldn\u2019t help noticing how warm and close he was.</p><p>\u201cIs it over? Already?\u201d She didn\u2019t want it to be.</p><p>\u201cDo you have to hurry back?\u201d Joshua asked. \u201cWe could take a short stroll in Central Park and enjoy the snow.\u201d</p><p>It went without saying that she shouldn\u2019t. Her family would be waiting for her. They assumed she was with Carl, not some strange man she barely recognized. Her father had always been protective of her. She was his jewel. Hannah remembered how pleased her parents had been when she\u2019d first started dating Carl. The fact that he was a rabbi\u2019s son added to their endorsement of the young man.</p><p>\u201cA stroll in Central Park,\u201d she repeated, and then before she could change her mind, she nodded. Her willingness to spend time with him, a man who was little more than a stranger, would be frowned upon by everyone concerned.</p><p>\u201cGoodness,\u201d Gabriel warned, \u201cdon\u2019t even think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d The fact that the archangel was traveling with her had cramped her style considerably.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019ve got up your sleeve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Archangels knew so little about romance; what else was she to do? Gabriel thought Carl Rabinsky was the perfect husband for Hannah. Anyone with half a brain could see how ill suited the young couple was. Carl was a determined man, sincere in his faith. Unfortunately he\u2019d fallen into a common trap. He was big on religion and weak on faith.</p><p>\u201cI can see what you\u2019re thinking and I\u2019m telling you right now, it isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d Gabriel continued, disapproval beaming from his piercing eyes. \u201cJoshua Shadduck is an important attorney. The two have nothing in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoshua is Jewish, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but that has nothing to do with the issues here. Goodness, listen to me. You\u2019re stirring up a hornets\u2019 nest if you continue in this vein. I absolutely forbid it, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019re no buts about it.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s brow was knit with a thick frown. He opened his mouth and Goodness was convinced he was about to argue further with her when a breathless but elated Shirley arrived.</p><p>\u201cI found Brynn Cassidy,\u201d the other angel announced gleefully. \u201cShe\u2019s with Suzie Chang, one of the girls from her class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re discussing something important here,\u201d Goodness said. She refused to let Shirley interrupt her now. Not when she was about to make an important point. She glared at the archangel. \u201cDidn\u2019t you notice Joshua and Hannah together? It\u2019s as plain as the wings on your back that they\u2019re right for each other.\u201d Anyone with eyes would recognize how lonely Joshua was. Success wasn\u2019t all it was cracked up to be. It seemed to her that he\u2019d come to this realization himself recently. As far as Goodness could tell, Hannah Morganstern complemented his life, and she wasn\u2019t about to let Gabriel tell her otherwise.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying,\u201d Gabriel insisted, \u201cis that you must leave well enough alone. You think I didn\u2019t notice the way you manipulated Hannah and Joshua? I\u2019m not blind. You practically steered her right into him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Goodness released a pent-up sigh. Dealing with Gabriel often required persistence. \u201cI realize you find this difficult to believe, but I\u2019m something of an expert in matters involving the heart. Remember last year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not likely to forget it,\u201d the archangel muttered. \u201cI was nearly sent back to singing with the choir because of you three.\u201d</p><p>Goodness ignored his comment, which she was sure was a gross exaggeration.</p><p>\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll keep your hands off of Hannah and Joshua,\u201d Gabriel warned, \u201cotherwise I\u2019ll have you restringing harps for the rest of your days.\u201d</p> <p>The threat was an empty one, and Goodness knew it.</p><p>\u201cDid anyone hear me?\u201d Shirley asked excitedly. \u201cI actually located Brynn Cassidy. Don\u2019t you realize what a miracle that was in this crowd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you,\u201d Gabriel told her with a sour look. \u201cMiracle or not, you won\u2019t be working with Brynn Cassidy. The schoolteacher needs far more help than you can offer. You can\u2019t work with Brynn and those kids from the high school. I have another assignment waiting for you,\u201d Gabriel insisted with a hard edge to his voice.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a take-it-or-leave-it situation.\u201d</p> <p>Goodness feared that Shirley was about to blow it. She was relieved when the other angel snapped her mouth closed. At times, Shirley could be downright argumentative. If Shirley made the mistake of debating this Brynn Cassidy issue, the archangel just might pull all three of them out of New York City. Goodness didn\u2019t want that to happen just when matters were beginning to look promising.</p><p>Without being obvious, she scanned the dispersing crowds, hoping to catch a glimpse of Hannah and Joshua. She found them strolling through Central Park, deep in conversation. The two were oblivious of everything around them. They made a striking couple, she mused, immeasurably pleased with herself. Archangels might be high-and-mighty creatures, but they knew little of dealing with humans and love. When it came to affairs of the heart, Goodness was far more knowledgeable than Gabriel. The problem, and admittedly it was a big one, was convincing him of that.</p><p>Joshua wasn\u2019t sure what had happened to him. He\u2019d suggested this walk in the park with Hannah for purely selfish reasons. The Thanksgiving Day parade had been enjoyable, but it hadn\u2019t been nearly as much fun until Hannah had joined him.</p><p>He remembered her with a clarity that surprised him. She was the daughter of the deli owner. When he\u2019d claimed her father made the best pastrami in town, he hadn\u2019t been exaggerating. Over the last few years he\u2019d visited the deli a number of times, but generally he had his lunch delivered. Hannah might well have been to his office.</p><p>Hannah was a delicate creature, beautiful in ways that struck a man\u2019s soul. She wasn\u2019t like the crisp, business professionals he knew and worked with on a daily basis. She inspired him with her gentle goodness. Although he\u2019d never met the man she was with\u2014Carl, if he remembered his name correctly\u2014already he found he didn\u2019t much like him. If Joshua had become separated from Hannah in a crowd, it would have taken a lot more than a little congestion for him to stop searching for her. Hannah hadn\u2019t said a lot, but it was obvious Carl didn\u2019t enjoy parades.</p><p>Joshua had taken Hannah\u2019s hand while strolling through the park. The snow had long since stopped, but the afternoon remained crisp and cold. A perfect winter day.</p> <p>The moment their hands linked, Joshua experienced a faint stirring of emotion. Faint stirring, nothing, he mused with a bleak smile. It felt as if someone had punched him in the stomach with a pipe iron.</p><p>He wondered if this was the woman he\u2019d been searching for all these months. He certainly hadn\u2019t expected her to be the daughter of a deli owner. It didn\u2019t matter, he decided. Who was he to question fate? They\u2019d met, and being with her, laughing, joking, talking, had felt instinctively right. Never had he been more comfortable with anyone.</p><p>It embarrassed him, the way he couldn\u2019t stop staring at her. She had such beautiful eyes, but then everything about Hannah was beautiful. She was guileless and genuine, and when she looked up and blinked, Josh swore he could see all the way to her soul.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking all this time and I never asked where you work,\u201d Hannah commented.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an attorney.\u201d He would have mentioned the name of the law firm, one of the most prestigious in Manhattan, but he didn\u2019t want to sound as though he were bragging. Knowing Hannah, he doubted that it would impress her. More than likely she wouldn\u2019t recognize the name of the firm.</p><p>\u201cA lawyer.\u201d She said this as if the information distressed her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like attorneys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. I think there are some wonderful attorneys, only . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he prodded.</p><p>\u201cMy parents were recently involved in a frivolous lawsuit, and my dad\u2019s convinced the real culprits in the case were the lawyers. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s developed something of a prejudice, but I don\u2019t think that will last long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019d hate to get off on the wrong foot with your family.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of her parents, Hannah looked at her watch. \u201cOh, dear,\u201d she said anxiously. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how late it was.\u201d She took several steps backward. \u201cThank you for a wonderful time. I\u2019m sorry to rush off like this.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d turned and was speed-walking away from him before he\u2019d had time to react. \u201cHannah,\u201d he called.</p><p>She spun around.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were wide, and she seemed to hesitate. Joshua decided it was best not to press her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll stop in at the deli and we can talk about it then.\u201d</p><p>She nodded abruptly, and it was plain she was in a hurry to get away.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019ll reassure you, I\u2019ll avoid mentioning I\u2019m an attorney.\u201d</p><p>Her beautiful eyes brightened with a soft smile before she hurried out of the park. Josh buried his hands in his pockets and ambled along the walkway toward Cherry Hill Fountain. He kicked lazily at burnt orange-colored leaves.</p><p>Josh found himself smiling broadly. His patience had paid off. For nearly thirty years he\u2019d been waiting to meet a woman like Hannah Morganstern. To think all this time she\u2019d been right under his nose. He threw back his head and laughed. The sound of his delight echoed through the park.</p><p>Hannah hurried into the apartment on top of the family deli, stripping the blue scarf from her neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank heaven you\u2019re home; I was worried, you\u2019re so late,\u201d her mother said, planting her hand over her heart as she stepped out of the kitchen. \u201cYour father and I didn\u2019t know what to think when Carl phoned and asked if you\u2019d returned safely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe parade was wonderful,\u201d Hannah said.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened with Carl?\u201d Her father stood with the morning paper clenched in his hands. He studied her over the top of his spectacles.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Hannah told them, walking into the kitchen. The smells of turkey and sage, pumpkin pie and applesauce, that greeted her caused her to pause and inhale deeply. Her stomach growled, reminding her how hungry she was.</p><p>\u201cCarl claims you disappeared into the crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to get a closer look at the floats,\u201d Hannah explained as she lifted the lid off a cast-iron kettle. Broth simmered with a mixture of savory herbs floating on the slowly churning surface.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about now that you\u2019re back safe and sound,\u201d her father muttered, studying his daughter as though he expected something of her. Hannah knew exactly what her family was hoping. They wanted Carl to ask for her hand in marriage.</p><p>\u201cCarl said he\u2019d be by later,\u201d Ruth Morganstern said, and shared a secret look with her husband of many years. The exchange confirmed Hannah\u2019s suspicions.</p><p>\u201cWe both think the world of Carl,\u201d her father told Hannah unnecessarily. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDependable,\u201d her mother added.</p><p>\u201cHonorable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA righteous man.\u201d Her mother nodded for emphasis.</p><p>Hannah offered them both a shaky smile and headed toward her bedroom. She didn\u2019t want to discuss Carl, not when her head was spinning from her time with another man. \u201cI\u2019m going to change my shoes and then I\u2019ll be back to help you with dinner.\u201d</p><p>Her father looped his arms around Ruth\u2019s shoulders. \u201cTake your time,\u201d her mother called out after her. \u201cDinner won\u2019t be ready for some time yet.\u201d</p><p>Inside her bedroom, Hannah slumped on the edge of her mattress. It would be impossible to tell them about meeting Joshua now. He was the man who caused her heart to sing. She couldn\u2019t disappoint them. Not with her family extolling Carl\u2019s virtues.</p><p>Hannah had only briefly discussed marriage with Carl. Their parents had been the ones who frequently spoke of the two entering into an agreement. As far as Carl\u2019s family was concerned, the marriage was a foregone conclusion. Her parents seemed to feel the same way.</p><p>Hannah lay back and stared up at the bedroom ceiling. Carl was a wonderful man. He was everything her parents had said and much more. Someday she probably would marry Carl.</p><p>She closed her eyes and thought about what their lives would be like together. She liked Carl, enjoyed his company. When he kissed her it was something sweet and gentle. But try as she might, Hannah couldn\u2019t imagine Carl ever being passionate. A smile cracked her lips, and she chided herself silently.</p><p>In her mind\u2019s eye she thought about the children she might have with Carl. But instead of conjuring up babies, her mind filled with Joshua Shadduck.</p><p>She shook her head in an effort to dispel the image. If only he wasn\u2019t an attorney. If only she\u2019d met him last year at this time. If only . . .</p><p>\u201cHannah.\u201d</p><p>Guiltily she bolted off the bed. \u201cYes, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarl\u2019s on the phone. He wants to know what took you so long. He\u2019s been worried. You should have phoned him first thing.\u201d</p><p>Hurriedly Hannah reached for her shoes. \u201cTell him I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannah will marry Carl,\u201d Gabriel said as if he needed to convince himself.</p><p>Goodness was wise enough to say nothing. She\u2019d learned the hard way that it was often more advantageous to hold one\u2019s tongue with the archangel.</p><p>\u201cYou understand this, don\u2019t you?\u201d Gabriel asked pointedly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right,\u201d the prayer ambassador answered without emotion. It demanded everything she had to hide her true feelings.</p><p>Gabriel studied her with a weary look. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you can handle this case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d She beamed him her brightest, most innocent smile.</p><p>\u201cNo monkey business.\u201d</p><p>Goodness\u2019s eyes rounded with indignation. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust remember that promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I please meet Jenny Lancaster now?\u201d Mercy asked.</p><p>Goodness wanted to kiss her friend for distracting Gabriel. She didn\u2019t know how much longer she would have been able to hide her feelings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh, yes. Jenny.\u201d Gabriel turned his attention away from Goodness and exhaled sharply. \u201cI\u2019d almost forgotten. Now there\u2019s a sorry case. Let me take you to her now.\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>\u201cJenny, wake up.\u201d Michelle Jordan burst into the bedroom and pulled open the thick drapes. Brilliant sunlight spilled into the room as Jenny Lancaster struggled to an upright position.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d she asked, yawning loudly. It couldn\u2019t be morning. Not yet. Not so soon. Her eyes burned and it felt as though she hadn\u2019t slept more than an hour or two.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s party time.\u201d Michelle dramatically threw her arms into the air.</p><p>Jenny collapsed against her pillow. \u201cNot for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor both of us, girl.\u201d Michelle curled up at the foot of Jenny\u2019s bed. \u201cJohn Peterman\u2019s sent out a casting call for a new Lehman musical. He\u2019s going to need twenty singers and dancers. I don\u2019t know about you, but I intend to be one of those who ends up on stage opening night. Now you can come along and audition with me, or you can sleep the rest of your life away.\u201d</p><p>Jenny closed her eyes. The choice shouldn\u2019t be this difficult. There was a time when she would have leapt out of bed, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, grabbed her dancing shoes, and headed out the front door. Not so these days. At twenty-three Jenny Lancaster felt like a has-been. Or, more appropriate, a never-was.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming or not?\u201d</p> <p>Another cattle call. Jenny had given up counting the number of times she\u2019d set her heart on getting a bit part on Broadway. Off Broadway, near Broadway. She didn\u2019t care. This was her dream. Her goal. Her ambition.</p><p>She\u2019d left Custer, Montana, blessedly naive about the cutthroat world of the stage. Three years later she felt washed-out, washed-up, and ready for the wringer.</p><p>Three years was a long time to subsist on one\u2019s dreams. Jenny would have thrown in the towel a long time before now if it hadn\u2019t been for one thing. Her family and friends back home believed in her. She was the bright, shining star the community had pinned its hopes upon. Back home she could outsing, outdance, and outact anyone in town. But in New York she was just another pretty face with talent.</p><p>\u201cTwenty singers and dancers,\u201d Jenny repeated, still trying to decide if another audition was worth all the pain involved. She wasn\u2019t sure her heart could stand another rejection. \u201cDoes twenty singers and twenty dancers mean Peterman needs forty people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Michelle said with her characteristic boundless energy. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, does it?\u201d</p><p>It did. Jenny sat upright and rubbed a hand down her face. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m up to this. Rejection hurts. Frankly I\u2019m not sure this is what I really want anymore,\u201d she whispered. Admitting this to her best friend was hard, but it needed to be said. She loved New York, but at heart she would always be a country girl.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t think of it like that. Rejections are simply the rungs to the ladder of success,\u201d Michelle announced, ever positive, ever confident.</p><p>Jenny sighed audibly. \u201cYou\u2019ve been listening to motivational tapes again, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Michelle nodded. \u201cIt shows that much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Almost against her will, Jenny tossed aside the bedding and climbed off the mattress. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll go, but I\u2019ll need a few minutes to put myself together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d Michelle pulled open her bottom drawer and took out a pair of black leotards. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to spend the rest of your life waitressing at Arnold\u2019s, do you? Sure you get to sing, but it isn\u2019t anywhere close to Broadway.\u201d</p><p>Jenny sincerely hoped her roommate didn\u2019t let anyone back in Custer know that. The entire town firmly believed in her talent. Firmly believed in her.</p><p>After so much time, she couldn\u2019t continue to make up excuses why her name didn\u2019t light up a marquee. So she\u2019d stretched the truth. All right, she\u2019d elasticized it to the point where it was no longer recognizable. Performing in an Off Broadway musical was a long shot from her job as a singing waitress. Her friends and family believed she was well on the road to becoming a star. Little could be further from the truth. The light of ambition in Jenny\u2019s eyes had dimmed considerably in the past three years. Not so long ago she would have jumped at the chance to audition for John Peterman. These days it was difficult to find the energy to drag herself out of bed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if all this trouble is worth the effort,\u201d she confessed as she reached for her beige dancing shoes.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk like that, Jenny. This is your dream.\u201d She hugged her clenched fists to her breast. \u201cDon\u2019t let go now. Not when you\u2019re so close to making it all come true.\u201d</p><p>Jenny wished she shared her friend\u2019s limitless enthusiasm. Michelle had been spurned as many times as Jenny. Yet her roommate continued to bounce back with renewed optimism, ever hopeful, ever cheerful, ever certain their big break was just around the next corner.</p><p>Part of Jenny\u2019s reluctance had to do with the season. Christmastime away from her family had always been difficult, but it seemed even more so this year. Not only could she not afford the trip home, but once she was with her family and friends, Jenny realized, she\u2019d never be able to continue with the lie. One look and her parents would guess the truth.</p><p>Then there was Trey, their neighbor and longtime family friend. The boy next door, only anyone who met the cattle rancher would be hard-pressed to refer to him as a boy. Whenever Jenny became disheartened, she closed her eyes and remembered Trey.</p><p>Trey sitting atop his roan, his Stetson dipped low enough to disguise his eyes. He did that on purpose, she believed, just so she couldn\u2019t read his expression. His ranch bordered her father\u2019s spread, so Trey had been around for as long as Jenny could remember.</p><p>While in school, Jenny had never given much thought to her handsome neighbor. In the years since she\u2019d been away, all that had changed. Whenever Jenny thought about home, it was Trey LaRue who popped into her mind. Trey riding the open range. Trey gentling a startled filly. Trey carrying a sick calf.</p><p>Of course he might be married by now, although she doubted it. Surely her mother would have said something if he\u2019d tied the knot. He was at the age\u2014past it, really\u2014when most ranchers married. Three years was a long time to be away from home. Although she remembered him, there was nothing to say he thought about her. A lot of things changed over time.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Michelle asked. Her roommate\u2019s eagerness was a burr under Jenny\u2019s saddle. By all that was right, she should be in bed. Her feet hadn\u2019t stopped hurting, nor had her back ceased to ache. Yet when she\u2019d finished dancing her heart out, singing until her vocal cords were strained, she\u2019d be due back at Arnold\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m as ready as I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d Even as she said the words, Jenny felt a sinking sensation in the pit of her stomach. Auditioning seemed a waste of effort. A waste of time. A waste of her heart.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Jenny?\u201d Mercy asked Gabriel, standing in the corner of the tiny apartment.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s been praying for her?\u201d This question came from Goodness.</p><p>Mercy glared at her friend as if to say she was the one who would be asking the questions. After all, this was her assignment. Goodness had already met her charge, and as always, her friend was looking to meddle. Mercy knew that look and sincerely hoped Gabriel didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThe prayer originated from her neighbor in Montana,\u201d Gabriel answered. He frowned as he said it, as if plowing through his memory to put a name to the request. \u201cTrey LaRue, I believe,\u201d he said decisively. \u201cTrey\u2019s known Jenny most of his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat has he asked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrey wants Jenny to come home for the holidays. It seems Jenny\u2019s father has been feeling poorly. Dillon Lancaster won\u2019t ask his daughter to come home, and neither will Jenny\u2019s mother. But both miss her terribly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t they visit New York?\u201d The solution seemed obvious to Mercy. She could easily manipulate the couple into heading for the wonders of the big city. Naturally Goodness and Shirley would be willing to lend her a hand. Already she was formulating a plan.</p><p>Why, the three of them had gotten so good at this sort of thing that it wouldn\u2019t surprise her if the Lancasters never guessed how they\u2019d gotten to New York. A little celestial manipulation never hurt anyone.</p><p>\u201cJenny has discouraged them from coming,\u201d Gabriel explained.</p><p>\u201cBut why . . .\u201d Mercy stopped herself. She already knew the answer. Jenny didn\u2019t want her family to know that she\u2019d lied. She wasn\u2019t starring in an Off Broadway production of Guys and Dolls. She was a waitress who quite literally sang for her supper. The line of success she\u2019d fed her family was gagging the young woman now. Jenny couldn\u2019t allow her parents to see where she worked. Being forced to admit the truth would humiliate her, so she continued to sabotage herself.</p><p>Lies were like that, Mercy realized, and wondered why humans so readily fell into that trap. She\u2019d seen for herself how lies tainted human lives. Would they never learn?</p><p>What had started out as a slight exaggeration on Jenny\u2019s part had turned into a monster that separated her from those she loved most. All because she hadn\u2019t wanted to disappoint her family. Instead she\u2019d disappointed herself.</p><p>\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be so hard, should it?\u201d Goodness said, looping her arm through Mercy\u2019s. \u201cFrom what we\u2019ve seen, Jenny\u2019s ready to give it up and head back to Montana all on her own. Not just for Christmas, either. After all the disappointment she\u2019s suffered, she\u2019s more than ready for the green, green pastures of home. I can\u2019t say that I blame her. The time has come for her to face up to a few home truths.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s brow rose as if Goodness\u2019s insight surprised him, and Mercy\u2019s friend beamed. \u201cIs that a fact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so fast to form an opinion about Jenny,\u201d Gabriel warned. \u201cShe\u2019s very talented. I shouldn\u2019t need to remind you what God says about the desires of one\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean she isn\u2019t ready to relinquish her dream?\u201d Mercy asked. She\u2019d read the situation the same as Goodness. It seemed all Jenny needed was one good excuse to pack her bags and head home to Montana. And to Trey, the young man who cared enough to pray for her return.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to answer those questions,\u201d Gabriel said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think you should underestimate the power of a dream. Jenny has lived and breathed little else for three long years. It\u2019s true she\u2019s discouraged, but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s willing to give up. You might be surprised to discover just how close she really is to seeing her name in lights. Don\u2019t forget,\u201d Gabriel warned, \u201cthat the darkest hour is just before dawn. She could be on the brink of something big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d Mercy felt the excitement churning inside her. But that enthusiasm slowly ground to a halt as she studied the archangel. \u201cIs there something you know that we don\u2019t?\u201d Gabriel occasionally withheld information in a blatant effort to teach them a lesson. Mercy had long suspected it to be so. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d the archangel assured them. \u201cJust don\u2019t be so quick to assume the obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy oh my, she is talented,\u201d Mercy admitted, watching her young charge\u2019s agile leap across the stage.</p><p>It was at times like this that Jenny realized how badly she hungered for this dream. Once she stood on stage with the other dancers, her adrenaline started flowing, pumping her deflated hopes until they soared higher and higher.</p><p>This was where she belonged, where she longed to be. Her heart hummed with excitement, waiting for the opportunity to prove herself.</p> <p>\u201cJenny Lancaster.\u201d Her name was called by a man sitting in the theater seating. Since the lights blocked her view, the casting director was no more than a hoarse, detached voice. From her best guess, she figured he was somewhere in the first five or six rows.</p><p>Jenny stepped forward and handed the piano man her sheet music.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you be singing?\u201d asked the same uninterested voice.</p><p>She moved one step and peered into the dark. \u201c \u2018Don\u2019t Cry for Me, Argentina.\u2019 \u201c</p><p>\u201cFine. Give us your best eight bars.\u201d</p> <p>It was always the same. Rarely did it vary. Jenny suspected she could have sung a tune from a Sesame Street production and no one would have known the difference, least of all the casting director. He\u2019d made up his mind even before her turn had come, even before she\u2019d been given a chance to prove what she could do.</p><p>Argentina might not weep for her, but Jenny felt the tears welling up inside her. Tears of disappointment. Tears of struggle. Tears of a dream that refused to die.</p><p>The first chords from the piano filled the silence. Jenny hung her head and closed her eyes, allowing the music to transport her to another world. She drew in a deep breath and slowly lifted her head. No longer was Jenny Lancaster auditioning for a bit part; she was playing the role of her life. Within the magic of a few notes, she was transformed from a disillusioned waitress into the ambitious wife of a South American dictator.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Mercy was set back on her wings. \u201cThat girl can sing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is talented,\u201d Shirley was quick to agree.</p><p>\u201cIncredible.\u201d Goodness seemed to be at a loss for words, which was completely unlike her.</p> <p>Mercy knew she could accept no credit for Jenny\u2019s skill; nevertheless she experienced a deep sense of pride that she should be assigned to this amazing young woman.</p><p>\u201cHer voice, why, it\u2019s almost . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngelic,\u201d Gabriel supplied, grinning broadly. It was a rare treat to find the archangel in such good spirits.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Mercy agreed. \u201cAngelic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe you can handle this request?\u201d he questioned.</p><p>Mercy was sure she could. \u201cYes,\u201d she assured him confidently. \u201cLeave everything to me.\u201d Somehow, some way, Mercy would come up with the means of helping Jenny fulfill her dreams. With a little help from her friends.</p><p>Anyone with this much talent, this much heart, deserved a break. A bit of intercession from the heavenly realm never hurt. Naturally Mercy wasn\u2019t about to let Gabriel know her plans, but then what he didn\u2019t know couldn\u2019t hurt him.</p><p>And while she had her hand in Jenny\u2019s life, Mercy decided, she might as well do what she could about getting the talented singer home for the holidays.</p> <p>\u201cNo funny stuff,\u201d Gabriel warned.</p><p>Mercy managed to look offended. \u201cGabriel, please, you insult me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t have you hot-wiring cars and sending them where you will.\u201d</p><p>Mercy\u2019s shoulders went back in a display of outrage. \u201cI\u2019d never resort to anything that underhanded.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t say anything for several moments. Then, scratching his head, he studied the three prayer ambassadors. \u201cCan anyone tell me why I don\u2019t believe you?\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like everyone to take out a clean piece of paper,\u201d Brynn instructed, standing in front of the classroom. It sounded like a simple enough request, one would think. But from the moaning and groaning, it was as if she\u2019d sprung a surprise quiz on them.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to make us write again, are you?\u201d Emilio Alcantara groaned aloud, voicing, Brynn suspected, the thoughts of half the class.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d she said, unwilling to let her students\u2019 lack of enthusiasm dampen her spirits.</p><p>Yolanda leaned so far out of her desk toward Denzil Johnson that she nearly toppled onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cYolanda,\u201d Brynn said, \u201cis there a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any paper. I wanted to borrow a piece from Denzil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your own paper, woman,\u201d the black youth protested. \u201cWhat do I look like, a friggin\u2019 Wal-Mart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loaned you paper last week.\u201d Yolanda\u2019s dark eyes snapped with outrage.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you were lucky enough to have me sit next to you. I never said nothin\u2019 about paying you back.\u201d</p><p>Yolanda\u2019s mouth thinned, and it looked as if she were about to explode when Suzie Chang saved the day.</p><p>\u201cI have an extra sheet she can use,\u201d the Chinese girl volunteered shyly, tearing off a clean page from her tablet and passing it across the aisle to Yolanda. The Hispanic girl grabbed it and glared at Denzil as if to say it would be a cold day in hell before he got anything from her again.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Suzie,\u201d Brynn said, eager to return to the writing assignment.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to have us write about this time?\u201d Emilio asked. \u201cNot something stupid, I hope.\u201d</p><p>Teaching the value clarification portion of the class had proved to be the most difficult for Brynn. She wanted to make this as interesting and as much fun as she could, but she often found herself on a completely different wavelength from her students.</p><p>The incident with Emilio in the hallway was a prime example. The teenager had actually expected her to lie on his behalf. Emilio didn\u2019t understand why she\u2019d told the truth about the knife. He\u2019d missed three days of school and consequently blamed her. He saw nothing wrong with his own behavior but seemed to feel that she\u2019d been the one to betray his trust.</p><p>It had taken the better part of another week for his sullen mood in class to disappear. She wasn\u2019t sure even now what she\u2019d done to get back into his good graces. Whatever it was, she was grateful. Emilio was a natural leader, so his attitude was quickly picked up by the others in class.</p><p>Ever since the incident with Emilio she\u2019d been subjected to an attitude of mistrust. It was as if she\u2019d fallen from grace in the eyes of her students.</p><p>\u201cFirst off, don\u2019t put your name on the top of the page.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want our names?\u201d This clearly came as a surprise since she\u2019d so often instructed them to remember just that.</p><p>\u201cNo names,\u201d she reiterated. \u201cNow I\u2019d like each of you to write one hundred and fifty words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe gotta count them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s about a page and a half,\u201d Brynn explained. \u201cThe subject of your paper is this: If I could kiss anyone in this classroom, who would it be, and why.\u201d</p><p>For a moment the entire class looked at her as if they couldn\u2019t believe what she\u2019d said. Someone smothered a giggle and catcalls echoed across the room.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take anyone long to get involved in the project. Soon heads were bowed over the paper, and her students wrote feverishly. Brynn liked to involve her students in some type of writing assignment, often on a daily basis. She did this for a number of reasons, but first and foremost was an effort to require them to clarify their thoughts on certain subjects. She attempted to balance a serious topic one day, followed by a lighter one the next.</p><p>Although she\u2019d been teaching the class for a number of weeks now, whenever they were asked to write, her students put up a royal stink. Often they bombarded her with silly questions or employed other delay tactics in an effort to forestall the assignment.</p><p>Not this time. Looking at them now, writing as fast as their hands would allow, one would think the first student finished would be excused for what remained of the quarter.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re done writing, please bring the papers to my desk.\u201d The class was both cooperative and silent. The cooperation part was a welcome relief. Brynn was beginning to feel like a salmon swimming upstream. Every inch was a struggle, every day a challenge.</p><p>One by one, her class delivered their papers to her desk. Before long Brynn had accumulated a tidy stack.</p><p>Curious whispers followed.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to read them?\u201d someone asked.</p><p>\u201cI will later,\u201d she promised, as if this were a normal assignment.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Emilio said, slouching down on his seat. \u201cI gotta right to know how many women want me.\u201d</p><p>Several of the girls booed, suggesting he wasn\u2019t the one on their list.</p><p>Emilio planted his hand over his heart and looked deeply grieved by their lack of appreciation for his obvious charms.</p><p>\u201cDid anyone put me down?\u201d Modesto demanded. \u201cEmilio\u2019s got a point, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne thing\u2019s for sure, no one picked Mike,\u201d taunted a boy in the back of class.</p><p>Mike was a loner and rarely contributed to class discussions. He suffered from a bad case of acne and kept his distance from the others. Brynn had never seen him talk to any of the other students. In many ways her heart went out to Mike, and she struggled to reach him. To have someone taunt him now was cruel and unnecessary. For the first time Brynn wondered about the wisdom of her assignment. It had sounded like such fun when she\u2019d planned it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure,\u201d Brynn said, and reached for the stack of papers. Her relief was great when she saw that one of the first papers mentioned Mike\u2019s name. \u201cHere\u2019s a paper for Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gotta be kidding.\u201d This came from Modesto. The youth sat up and turned around to stare at Mike.</p><p>Brynn walked down the aisle and handed Mike the paper.</p><p>\u201cHow come he gets to read his and I can\u2019t have mine?\u201d This came from Emilio.</p><p>The corners of Mike\u2019s mouth turned up and revealed a brief smile when she laid the sheet down on his desk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get to you soon enough,\u201d Brynn promised.</p><p>\u201cIf anyone chose him,\u201d Yolanda joked.</p><p>\u201cDo bears shit in the woods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmilio,\u201d Brynn admonished. \u201cI won\u2019t have that language in my class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Miss Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d Brynn heard someone say under their breath. \u201cShe might get you suspended again.\u201d</p><p>The next paper listed Emilio\u2019s name. She handed it to him and he let out a triumphant cry and punctured the air with his fist. \u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d he shouted. \u201cWomen are crazy about me.\u201d Excited and pleased, he was halfway out of his desk. \u201cI got charisma, you know. Real charisma.\u201d</p><p>Brynn walked up and down the aisles, delivering the papers. It flustered her a bit when she found her own name toward the top of the page. Emilio\u2019s handwriting was immediately recognizable, and she flushed. She\u2019d never intended for anyone to put down her name.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to want these back, are you?\u201d Yolanda pleaded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. Keep them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Cassidy.\u201d Denzil\u2019s hand waved frantically. \u201cThere must be some mistake. I didn\u2019t get any papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re greedy,\u201d Yolanda took delight in informing him. \u201cBesides, why would anyone want to kiss you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you didn\u2019t have any problem the other night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d had too much to drink and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what you said earlier.\u201d</p><p>The bell rang just then, and Brynn was saved from having to break off a spat between the two for the second time that day. Whatever was taking place between Yolanda and Denzil was best settled outside the classroom.</p><p>\u201cFor your assignment,\u201d Brynn said, raising her hand to capture their attention before the room emptied, \u201cread the next chapter of The Diary of Anne Frank.\u201d</p><p>Her words were followed by a loud moan.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see everyone tomorrow afternoon. Have a good evening.\u201d</p><p>It never ceased to amaze Brynn how fast her classroom emptied. It was as though her students stampeded toward the door in an effort to escape a nuclear holocaust.</p><p>As was her habit at the end of the day, Brynn sat at her desk and graded assignments, but today she didn\u2019t have much time because of a dental appointment in New Jersey. After a half hour, she tucked what she hadn\u2019t finished into her briefcase and headed toward the staff parking lot.</p><p>\u201cYo, Ms. Cassidy!\u201d Emilio raced toward her.</p><p>\u201cHello, Emilio.\u201d</p><p>His steps soon matched hers. \u201cYou probably guessed it was me who wrote down your name, right?\u201d</p> <p>Brynn could feel her face growing warm.</p><p>\u201cListen, I thought I should explain,\u201d he said quickly, looking slightly embarrassed himself. \u201cI gotta be careful paying too much attention to any one chick. You see, there are three or four in the class who\u2019ve got the hots for me. I was trying to be diplomic about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiplomatic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, Emilio, and applaud your efforts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, \u2019cause I don\u2019t need chick trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured it was something like that,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d she said, doing her best to disguise her amusement. One thing was certain: she didn\u2019t want to be the cause of \u201cchick problems\u201d for Emilio Alcantara.</p><p>Emilio turned and hurried across the parking lot toward the basketball hoop where his friends were busy playing two on two.</p><p>Brynn climbed inside her car and turned the key. It flickered to life, sputtered, and then quickly died. Surprised, she tried again, with the same results. She hadn\u2019t left her lights on that morning, she was sure of that. Her vehicle had recently been serviced. She tried once more, and this time the engine did nothing more than cough and choke.</p><p>\u201cNo, please, no,\u201d Brynn murmured, and pressed her forehead against the steering wheel. Trouble with her car was the last thing she needed.</p><p>Hannah shouldn\u2019t be this eager to see Joshua again, but she was. Again and again her gaze drifted toward the deli\u2019s front door as she waited impatiently for the man she\u2019d met at Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day parade.</p><p>Her heart pounded like a race car piston every time she thought about Joshua. He\u2019d been so gentle and caring. So considerate.</p><p>Although they\u2019d only just met, they hadn\u2019t lacked for conversation. Joshua was the kind of man she could talk to for hours on end. Generally Hannah found herself tongue-tied and uneasy around men, but not with Joshua. It was as if they\u2019d been friends for a long time.</p><p>Friends.</p><p>The word comforted her and eased her conscience.</p><p>Carl had joined her family for Thanksgiving dinner, and afterward he\u2019d sat in the living room with her father. The two men had talked far into the evening, debating political issues and other matters. Before he\u2019d left, Hannah\u2019s parents had discreetly left the room, affording her time alone with her beau. At first Carl and Hannah had seemed awkward with each other, Carl as much as she.</p><p>In an effort to ease the discomfort, she apologized for having lost him while at the parade. Carl reminded her that he felt responsible for her safety and suggested that in the years to come they\u2019d watch the parade on television.</p><p>Hannah had lowered her head to hide her disappointment. Then, almost as if it were expected of him, Carl had leaned forward and gently pressed his lips to hers.</p><p>It was a sweet kiss, undemanding and totally lacking in passion.</p><p>Standing in the deli, Hannah closed her eyes and tried to dredge up some emotion, some deep feelings for Carl. But try as she might, she felt nothing. Surely not desire. Definitely no compelling yearning for his company. He was Carl, the rabbi\u2019s son. The man her parents felt would make her the perfect husband.</p><p>\u201cHannah,\u201d her mother admonished, coming out of the kitchen. Her arms were loaded with a tray of sliced bread. \u201cAre you ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you stand there with your eyes closed? We have customers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d And Hannah was. She didn\u2019t know what was wrong with her to dawdle when there was work to be done.</p><p>Her mother peeled off a list of lunch orders from the fax machine, smoothed them out on the counter, and went about assembling sandwiches with a skill and dexterity that spoke of many years\u2019 experience.</p><p>Hannah lent a hand, packing the orders into plain brown bags and marking each one. The scent of freshly baked bread spilled out of the kitchen and into the front of the deli, mingling with those of sliced pastrami and knishes, her father\u2019s specialties.</p><p>After a few minutes, Hannah tried again. \u201cMama, tell me how you met Dad.\u201d</p><p>Ruth Morganstern slowly lifted her eyes to Hannah. She appeared surprised by the question. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for such foolishness now.\u201d</p><p>Disappointed, Hannah said nothing.</p><p>\u201cWe have orders and you\u2019re asking me about your father and me?\u201d She laughed lightly. \u201cIt was so many years ago now. For over forty years I\u2019ve loved this man. I don\u2019t remember when we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d David shouted from the far side of the deli. \u201cForty-three years and you don\u2019t remember? What kind of wife forgets the day she met the man who would be her husband?\u201d</p><p>Ruth laughed and dismissed him with a wave. \u201cI remember some things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope to God you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was handsome,\u201d Hannah\u2019s mother said out of the corner of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore so then,\u201d Ruth added, her eyes crinkling with amusement.</p><p>\u201cYour mother was even more beautiful than she is now,\u201d Hannah\u2019s father called back. \u201cI\u2019d look at her and forget all about slicing meat. The time I courted her I nearly lost two fingers.\u201d</p><p>Hannah laughed, delighted at the exchange between her parents. It seemed the lunch crowd, pressed against the glass display case, lost their impatience, and there were shared smiles all around.</p><p>Her father handed a thick pastrami sandwich on a paper plate to a young businessman. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to excuse my daughter,\u201d he said under his breath, but loudly enough for Hannah to hear. \u201cShe\u2019s in love.\u201d</p><p>In love? This was news to Hannah. But then, if she were to marry Carl, it was implied that they cared deeply for each other. Hannah liked Carl, respected him. He was a good, honorable man and, according to her parents, a fine catch.</p><p>Her mother couldn\u2019t have been more pleased when Hannah first started dating Carl. A rabbi\u2019s son. In Ruth\u2019s eyes, Carl was a better catch than a doctor or even an attorney.</p><p>An attorney. Automatically Hannah\u2019s thoughts drifted back to Joshua, although he\u2019d never been far from her mind since they\u2019d met.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Ruth said, handing Hannah the bag loaded with faxed orders. \u201cWith your head full of romance, can I trust you not to confuse these orders?\u201d she teased affectionately.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Hannah answered, and blushed.</p><p>\u201cYour head\u2019s some place else these days.\u201d Her mother leveled her gaze on Hannah. \u201cYour head and your heart.\u201d Hannah reached for her hand-knit scarf and wool coat. The deli employed a number of runners, but she was often needed to fill in during the lunch-hour rush.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be long,\u201d she promised before heading out into the cold.</p><p>Both her parents stared after her, and Hannah had the distinct impression that they would soon be bragging to their customers about her imminent engagement to Carl.</p><p>The wind nipped at her face as she hurried along Front Street in the bustling financial district. Taxis honked with impatience and a bus roared past, leaving her to choke on its exhaust.</p><p>Hannah\u2019s steps were filled with purpose as she wove her way in and around the foot traffic. She hadn\u2019t gone more than a block when she heard someone call her name. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, she looked over her shoulder. She didn\u2019t see anyone she knew.</p><p>\u201cHannah, wait.\u201d</p><p>The voice was recognizable now. Joshua.</p><p>She scanned the crowd but couldn\u2019t see him. Then she found him, standing on the other side of the street. He raised his arm high above his head and waved to attract her attention.</p><p>Standing on her tiptoes, Hannah smiled and waved back.</p><p>Joshua gestured for her to wait, and as soon as the traffic passed, he jogged across the street.</p><p>\u201cHello again,\u201d he said, smiling down at her.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>There didn\u2019t seem to be anything more to say, but her pulse quickened and she felt as if her heart were trying to escape from inside her chest.</p><p>\u201cI was on my way to the deli when I saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m delivering orders,\u201d she told him. She didn\u2019t have time to talk, not when hungry customers were waiting for their lunches. \u201cI can\u2019t visit now.\u201d Regret settled over her. All day she\u2019d waited for the opportunity to see Joshua again, and now, when she did happen upon him, she was forced to leave.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have to get back right away?\u201d</p><p>She should. She knew she should. Her parents might need her to make a second run and possibly a third. She hedged, not sure what to do.</p><p>\u201cFive minutes,\u201d Josh suggested. \u201cTen. Listen, I\u2019ll help you deliver these orders and you won\u2019t be away any time at all. Don\u2019t say no, Hannah.\u201d</p><p>Hannah knew she shouldn\u2019t, but she found it even more difficult to turn him down, to deny herself the pleasure of this one short encounter. She gave him a barely discernible nod, praying she was doing the right thing.</p><p>Even before she had a chance to think the matter through, Joshua reached inside her carrying bag and grabbed three lunch orders. Not giving her time to protest, he rattled off the address to his office and instructed her to meet him there in ten minutes.</p><p>Feeling slightly guilty, she hurried to deliver what remained of the orders. Hannah often took a couple of minutes to chat with her customers, many of whom she considered friends, but not this afternoon. She was in and out as fast as she could manage it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As soon as she could, she made her way to Joshua\u2019s office building. Crammed inside an elevator, she headed for the twenty-sixth floor. The elevator doors slid open and she stepped into an office complex lavishly decorated in mauves and grays. The names of the law firm partners were elegantly sprawled in large gold letters across one fabric-covered wall.</p><p>Hannah had been inside this complex a number of times and knew it to be one of the most prestigious law firms in Manhattan. She\u2019d had no idea Joshua was a part of this firm.</p><p>Law clerks bustled about, and the phone jingled. Clients lingered in the waiting room.</p><p>\u201cMay I help you?\u201d the receptionist asked. If she recognized Hannah as the girl from the deli, she didn\u2019t say anything.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Hannah Morganstern,\u201d she said.</p><p>The woman\u2019s face relaxed into a smile. \u201cAh yes, Mr. Shadduck said you\u2019d be here soon. I\u2019ll have someone take you right back.\u201d She motioned toward one of the law clerks.</p><p>Hannah was escorted down a wide hallway. The law clerk gestured toward Joshua\u2019s door, which was open. Joshua stood on the far side of the office. He must have sensed her arrival because he turned around and his face brightened with a warm, welcoming smile.</p><p>She knew it was impolite to stare, but she couldn\u2019t take her eyes off the framed list of achievements that lined his walls. This was no ordinary man. He was rich and powerful.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>She pulled her gaze away from the wall, surprised he had read her so easily. \u201cI\u2019ve never been inside your office before.\u201d She\u2019d delivered his lunch any number of times but had never been past the foyer and the receptionist. She recognized Joshua from the times he\u2019d come into the deli himself.</p><p>\u201cSit down. I\u2019ll ring Mary for something hot. Which do you prefer? Coffee or tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I really can\u2019t stay.\u201d To think that she\u2019d allowed this important attorney to deliver lunches on her behalf. Hannah was mortified to the very marrow of her bones.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stay? Why not? I thought we had this all settled.\u201d He walked toward her and reached for her hand. Hannah didn\u2019t know if it was from the cold or the shock of seeing Joshua in this environment, but her fingers were icy cold.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re freezing.\u201d He rubbed her right hand between his own two hands. \u201cYou should be wearing gloves.\u201d</p><p>She felt completely out of her element. Pride prevented her from making up some excuse and rushing away. \u201cI . . . I didn\u2019t know,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>Josh led her to a comfortable brown leather sofa and sat her down. \u201cDidn\u2019t know what?\u201d</p><p>Hannah held her tongue rather than blurt out the truth. When they\u2019d met at the parade he was a familiar face, someone she recognized. In this office, he was the epitome of the kind of man her father distrusted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about you all weekend,\u201d he said. \u201cHow was your Thanksgiving?\u201d</p><p>Now was the perfect opportunity to tell him how close she was to becoming engaged to Carl. She could bring Carl\u2019s name up naturally and explain the situation. She could tell him how Carl had joined her family for dinner. How Carl and her father had talked. How Carl had kissed her good night. How they\u2019d met on the Sabbath, after services in the synagogue.</p><p>\u201cIt was very nice,\u201d she said instead, wanting to kick herself. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ate with my mother and grandmother.\u201d</p><p>That started it. Within a matter of minutes he had her laughing over something his grandmother said, and they were immersed in conversation.</p><p>Twenty minutes slipped by, and it seemed like only five. \u201cI have to get back,\u201d she said, unable to disguise her regret. \u201cThank you for the tea . . . for everything.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t indulge herself again. Not with Joshua.</p> <p>Whatever made her so bold, Hannah would never know. She stood, prepared to walk away, and before she left, she pressed the palm of her hand to Joshua\u2019s clean-shaven face.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Joshua,\u201d she said, and not giving him time to answer, she hurried from his office.</p><p>Her mother eyed her wearily when Hannah arrived back at the deli. \u201cWhat took you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI got sidetracked,\u201d Hannah admitted.</p><p>\u201cNext time don\u2019t visit so long,\u201d her father warned her. \u201cWe needed you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late. Do you need me to make another run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Louise was able to do it.\u201d Her mother rattled off a list of tasks. Hannah was grateful to work in the kitchen the rest of the afternoon.</p><p>\u201cHannah,\u201d her father called two hours later. \u201cA package\u2019s been delivered for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me?\u201d Drying her hands on a linen towel, Hannah stepped out to the front of the deli. A freckle-faced delivery boy held out a small, flat box. \u201cHannah Morganstern?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSign here.\u201d He thrust a clipboard at her.</p><p>Hannah penned her name and then, with her parents watching, unwrapped the flat, oblong box.</p><p>Inside were a pair of expensive leather gloves and a note from Joshua.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard you sing better,\u201d Michelle said as she and Jenny returned to their shared apartment. \u201cOh, Jenny, this is the break we\u2019ve been waiting for. We\u2019re going to sing and dance on Broadway. I can feel it in my bones. We\u2019re really going to make it.\u201d</p><p>They often built each other up after an audition. Casting directors weren\u2019t known for lavishing potential stars with positive feedback, so they gave it to each other.</p><p>\u201cYour voice . . .\u201d Michelle hesitated as though she had trouble finding the words. \u201cIt\u2019s different now. There\u2019s a depth and maturity that wasn\u2019t there six months ago.\u201d Michelle set the mail on the kitchen table. \u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand me, you\u2019ve always been good, but this afternoon you were nothing short of brilliant.\u201d</p><p>Jenny rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not blowing smoke out my ears, either.\u201d Michelle sounded slightly offended. \u201cI mean it, Jenny. I really think you\u2019re going to get a part, maybe even one of the leads.\u201d</p><p>Jenny knew otherwise. She sang her heart out the way she did for every audition. Nothing was going to change. She refused to build up her hopes again.</p><p>\u201cThis looks interesting,\u201d Michelle said, holding up an envelope and tossing it to her. \u201cIt\u2019s addressed to you. It might even be a Christmas card. Already? Good grief, it\u2019s not even December yet.\u201d</p><p>Jenny examined the envelope, her gaze scanning the return address. She recognized it immediately, and her breath jammed in her throat.</p><p>\u201cJenny? What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from Trey,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cTrey who?\u201d</p><p>She stood and walked around the table while motioning with her hands, unable to formulate the words. \u201cTrey LaRue . . . my neighbor, or rather my parents\u2019 neighbor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never mentioned him before,\u201d Michelle said.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t?\u201d That seemed impossible. He was an integral part of what she considered home and family.</p><p>\u201cWell, open it and find out what he has to say,\u201d Michelle encouraged.</p><p>That seemed the most logical thing to do. Jenny\u2019s hand trembled as she peeled back the flap and withdrew a card. A colorful turkey decorated the front, its plumage fanned out across the top. She opened the card and found Trey had written only one short sentence: \u201cI\u2019m eager to see you this Christmas.\u201d His name was signed below in smooth, even strokes of the fountain pen.</p><p>Jenny\u2019s heart sank to the pit of her stomach. She handed the card to Michelle.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going home for the holidays?\u201d</p><p>Jenny shook her head. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t. Not with money so tight.\u201d Not after she\u2019d let everyone believe she had a starring role in an Off Broadway production.</p><p>\u201cI like his signature,\u201d Michelle said, studying the card. \u201cYou can tell a lot about a man by the way he signs his name.\u201d Her look was thoughtful. \u201cBut,\u201d she continued, grinning at Jenny, \u201cI\u2019d rather have you tell me all about him yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say?\u201d Jenny murmured, surprised to discover she didn\u2019t want to discuss Trey with her best friend.</p><p>She\u2019d never missed home more than she did right at that moment. She longed to gaze into a night sky where the stars weren\u2019t obliterated by city lights. She wanted to close her eyes and smell the scent of fresh hay. Home was cattle and mud and frustration. Home was love. Home was Trey.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hasn\u2019t written you before, has he?\u201d Michelle pressed.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy now?\u201d</p><p>Jenny shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. He owns the spread next to ours,\u201d she volunteered, hoping her friend would help her reason it out. A smile touched the edges of her mouth. \u201cHe\u2019s a cowboy from head to foot. Full of grit and mettle. Stubborn and determined, with skin as tan as leather and a constitution of iron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you date him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo . . . he\u2019s older than me by several years.\u201d Eight years had made a world of difference when she was in high school, but it didn\u2019t seem all that important now. \u201cHe\u2019s probably one of the most decent, hardworking men I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious he wants you to come home.\u201d</p><p>Jenny set aside the card and exhaled a long, slow breath. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t, so there\u2019s no use sitting around here stewing about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems a shame, after him writing and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go home,\u201d Jenny said forcefully. \u201cYou can\u2019t, either, because the both of us are going to have plum roles in the new Lehman musical, and we\u2019ll be in the thick of rehearsals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Michelle said as if this were something she hadn\u2019t considered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be stars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStars,\u201d Michelle repeated. \u201cOur names will light up the marquee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBright lights, and bright futures.\u201d But even as she said the words, they rang false in her ears.</p><p>\u201cGoodness.\u201d Gabriel was furious. Shirley, Goodness, and Mercy had ignored him at every turn, and he wasn\u2019t putting up with it this year. His schedule was busy enough without those three meddling in matters that were none of their concern.</p><p>\u201cYou called?\u201d The three shot up to heaven, looking as innocent as newborn lambs. Their feathery wings were tucked firmly in place, and their expressions were filled with guileless innocence.</p><p>\u201cShirley,\u201d he roared. \u201cDid I or did I not tell you to stay away from Brynn Cassidy?\u201d He didn\u2019t give her a chance to reply. \u201cMight I ask what you were doing in her classroom this afternoon? This is your assignment,\u201d he said, handing her a slip of paper. \u201cNow I expect you to help Craig Houle. If I see you anywhere close to Manhattan High School again, it will be cause for disciplinary action.\u201d</p><p>The three gasped.</p><p>Gabriel refused to allow these prayer ambassadors to manipulate him any further.</p><p>\u201cGoodness, what did I tell you about Hannah? You don\u2019t think I know that you had a hand in Joshua Shadduck running into her this afternoon? Well, I\u2019m on to your games. You will keep your fingers out of her life, is that understood?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Goodness nodded.</p><p>\u201cAs for you, Mercy . . .\u201d He looked down over his notes and, flustered, ran a hand over his face. He glanced up at the third angel. \u201cOh my, you\u2019re going to need all the help you can get.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>\u201cGabriel handed you an assignment on a piece of paper.\u201d Goodness was offended on Shirley\u2019s behalf, and rightly so. Never in their two-year history of working the Christmas holiday prayer rush had they been treated so shabbily. It was downright degrading.</p> <p>\u201cIt might not be so bad,\u201d Mercy suggested, gathering close to her friend\u2019s side. The third angel was the peacemaker of the group. \u201cThe least we can do is give Gabriel the benefit of the doubt.\u201d</p><p>Shirley peeled open the folded sheet. Goodness and Mercy crowded close in an effort to read over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThe prayer request is from Craig Houle,\u201d the angel told them. \u201cHe\u2019s ten and has asked God for a chess set for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d Mercy flapped her wings in a display of disgust. \u201cA chess set for a ten-year-old boy. Why, that\u2019s an insult to our good names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a tradition to uphold.\u201d</p> <p>Goodness couldn\u2019t stay in one spot, not when she was this angry. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of pride. If anyone could help Brynn Cassidy with those high schoolers, it\u2019s Shirley. This other stuff is child\u2019s play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d Shirley declared. \u201cWe have something to prove, so let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>Indignant, the three returned to earth, their feathers in a dither, swirling down on the unsuspecting city like the Horsemen due from the Apocalypse.</p><p>\u201cExactly where does this Craig Houle live?\u201d Goodness demanded as the three hovered over the Queensboro Bridge. Gabriel should count his blessings. There was a time, not so long past, when Goodness would have taken delight in dallying with streetlights and rerouting New York City traffic.</p><p>\u201cAccording to this, Craig lives on Roosevelt Island,\u201d Shirley answered, reading over the request form. \u201cAt this time of day, he\u2019s most likely in school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s his parents we need to influence, right?\u201d Mercy asked, thinking on her feet\u2014er, wings.</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d the other two agreed.</p><p>\u201cThen all we need do is convince his mother or father to do a little pre-Christmas shopping.\u201d</p><p>Goodness made a tsk-tsk sound. \u201cI think it\u2019s time we taught Gabriel a lesson on just how good we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever been more offended,\u201d Shirley said as the three briskly headed toward Roosevelt Island.</p><p>Peggy Houle walked down the quiet hospital corridor and sat at the nurses\u2019 station. Her rubber soles barely made a sound on the polished tile floor.</p><p>She started to make a notation in one of her patient\u2019s charts when she noticed a newspaper spread open across the top of the counter.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s odd,\u201d she mumbled to herself, and scooted the paper aside.</p><p>She looked around, wondering who\u2019d left it. One thing was certain: none of the nurses were accorded the luxury of sitting down and reading. Not while on duty, at any rate. The hospital was short-staffed as it was, and breaks, even the ones allotted them in the terms of their contract, were often few and far between.</p> <p>\u201cMy dogs are barking.\u201d Ellen Freeman, another nurse, joined Peggy. She slipped off her shoe and rubbed her sore toes. \u201cThis is what I get for not breaking in these new shoes first.\u201d She reached for the newspaper. \u201cWho left this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It wasn\u2019t here five minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Ellen said, pointing to the printed page. \u201cThere\u2019s a gigantic toy sale going on for the next couple of days. I haven\u2019t even started my Christmas shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was finished last week,\u201d Peggy said, feeling almost smug. She\u2019d hit the stores her first day off following Thanksgiving and finished it all in one fell swoop\u2014wrapping paper, new decorations, tinsel, the whole nine yards.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a reason on this earth good enough for her to voluntarily step inside a store again in the whole month of December. Not when it seemed the entire city had gone crazy. At the end of her shift all Peggy wanted to do was head home.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking I\u2019d buy the kids educational gifts this year,\u201d Ellen murmured. \u201cSomething that will stir their minds instead of those brainless television games. I can\u2019t tell you how sick I am of them sitting like zombies holding on to their joysticks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA chess set?\u201d Peggy said, and snapped her head back, startled.</p><p>\u201cA chess set,\u201d Ellen repeated, oblivious of her friend\u2019s chagrin. \u201cNow that I think about it, you\u2019re right. A chess set is an excellent idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I just say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA chess set.\u201d Ellen looked up, surprised. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo . . . the funniest thing just happened.\u201d Peggy slapped the side of her head, hoping that would help.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ellen was curious now.</p><p>\u201cThe words a chess set echoed in my ear. Three times, and each time I swear I was hearing a different voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still think it\u2019s an excellent idea,\u201d Ellen said, and replaced her shoe. \u201cAre you sure you won\u2019t come to the toy store with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh . . .\u201d Peggy hesitated, then found herself agreeing. \u201cSure,\u201d she mumbled, \u201cwhy not?\u201d For the life of her, she couldn\u2019t imagine why she was doing such a thing. \u201cWho knows, maybe Craig would be interested in learning how to play chess himself,\u201d she said to justify her actions. After all, it was a good idea. Her son would enjoy learning the game.</p><p>Peggy leaned back on her chair. Abruptly she shook her head, then repeatedly slapped her hand against her ear. \u201cIt happened again,\u201d she said incredulously.</p><p>\u201cYou heard the words a chess set?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peggy said, and shook her head like a dog fresh out of the water. \u201cIt was the same three voices, only this time they said . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ellen prodded.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to believe this.\u201d Peggy wasn\u2019t entirely sure she believed it herself. \u201cPiece of cake,\u201d she mumbled, and shrugged, completely baffled.</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d Shirley said, pointing into the distance. \u201cBrynn Cassidy\u2019s in trouble.\u201d It was just what she\u2019d expected would happen.</p><p>\u201cTrouble?\u201d Mercy repeated. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Cocky with their success, Goodness brushed the grit from her hands. \u201cTrouble\u2019s our middle name. Brynn doesn\u2019t have a thing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrynn might not, but we do,\u201d Mercy said, looking skeptical. \u201cGabriel isn\u2019t going to like this one bit. Not after the warning he gave us to stay away from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrynn\u2019s car won\u2019t start,\u201d Shirley informed her friends, her voice growing more concerned. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t like the looks of those men, either.\u201d Clad in black leather jackets, two men stood on the other side of the chain-link fence, watching Brynn.</p><p>Brynn climbed out of her car and opened the hood. She cast a wary eye toward the men.</p><p>\u201cIf ever I\u2019ve seen anyone with evil intentions, it\u2019s those two,\u201d Shirley informed her friends.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got knives,\u201d Mercy said, tugging on Goodness\u2019s sleeve.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something,\u201d Shirley cried, hoping to hide her panic.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t dare,\u201d Goodness insisted, gripping Shirley by the arm and stopping her. \u201cMercy\u2019s right. If Gabriel finds out, it\u2019d be just the excuse he\u2019s looking for to stick us with guard duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll take matters into my own hands,\u201d Shirley insisted.</p><p>\u201cTalk to Gabriel,\u201d Mercy suggested. \u201cGoodness and I can keep those two thugs occupied while you reason this out with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I hear someone mention my name?\u201d Gabriel appeared just then, startling the three angels.</p><p>\u201cGabriel,\u201d Shirley said boldly, \u201cwe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed we do. What\u2019s this I hear about Peggy Houle experiencing hearing problems?\u201d</p><p>Shirley, Goodness, and Mercy clammed up so fast their teeth made clicking sounds when their jaws closed.</p><p>\u201cI strongly suspect a bit of . . . intercession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a question of my own.\u201d Shirley stepped forward and bravely confronted the archangel. \u201cExactly whom have you assigned to work with Brynn Cassidy?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel hesitated. \u201cAs a matter of course, I hadn\u2019t gotten around to choosing anyone just yet.\u201d</p><p>This was all Shirley needed to hear. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly as I suspected,\u201d she turned to inform her two friends with an indignant huff. \u201cIn the meantime Brynn Cassidy flounders, while heaven looks on unconcerned.\u201d</p><p>When she dared, Shirley chanced a look in his direction. \u201cI want in,\u201d she informed Gabriel, her hand braced against her hip.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think you can handle this case?\u201d Gabriel\u2019s intense eyes burned holes straight into her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Shirley admitted. \u201cAt least not alone, but I have two friends who can help. In addition to . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gabriel prodded.</p><p>\u201cIn addition to my friends, there\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a host of heavenly assistance that\u2019s always on call.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel sighed. \u201cYou just might need it.\u201d</p><p>Shirley opened her mouth to further her argument, then realized what the archangel had said. \u201cYou mean to say you\u2019re willing to give me the assignment?\u201d The winds of indignity that had ruffled her sails fell slack. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>From the tight set of his mouth, the archangel looked as if he already regretted this. \u201cOne condition. You must agree to call for help when you need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d Shirley said solemnly, and smiled at her two friends.</p><p>\u201cJust remember we can accomplish all things with the power of God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll things,\u201d Shirley, Goodness, and Mercy repeated.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll start right now,\u201d Gabriel suggested. \u201cI\u2019ll let you take care of the problem of those two malcontents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing,\u201d Shirley said, eager to get started on the assignment now that it was officially hers. She eyed the two men watching Brynn, and almost felt sorry for them. It seemed to her they were prime candidates for a bit of intervention. Perhaps they should meet up with an old friend, one they weren\u2019t eager to see. Like their parole officer. Angel Shirley in disguise.</p><p>\u201cI sincerely hope you know a good mechanic.\u201d Gabriel cast his gaze over to the disabled vehicle; then without a sound, without a clue, he disappeared.</p><p>\u201cWe do know a good mechanic, don\u2019t we?\u201d Shirley asked, looking to her friends.</p><p>Goodness and Mercy stared back blankly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Mercy to Shirley. \u201cWe thought you did.\u201d</p><p>It was barely after four and already the sky was growing dark. Within a half hour night would settle over the city like a black velvet quilt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brynn Cassidy had long since given up the idea of seeing her dentist. Missing the appointment to have her teeth cleaned was a minor inconvenience compared to the hassles of dealing with car troubles.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t leave her Ford Escort here overnight, that much she knew. In this high-crime area, she\u2019d be fortunate to find the shell of her vehicle left by morning. Nor did she know of a good garage, especially one close by. She cast a look across the street, surprised and grateful that the two men lingering there moments earlier had disappeared.</p><p>\u201cAre you having trouble, Miss Cassidy?\u201d Emilio walked up to her, a basketball tucked under one arm.</p><p>Brynn was so grateful that someone had asked that it was all she could do to keep from blurting out her troubles. \u201cIt won\u2019t start, and I haven\u2019t got a clue what could be wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Emilio walked around her vehicle as though inspecting it. \u201cI know a little bit about engines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you might look at it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d Emilio slid halfway inside the driver\u2019s seat. One foot remained on the asphalt parking lot while he turned the ignition key. He pumped the gas pedal a couple of times while her car made a sick grinding sound.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Brynn asked expectantly.</p><p>\u201cYou sure it isn\u2019t your battery?\u201d Emilio asked.</p> <p>\u201cGood grief, I wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>The teenager seemed to find her answer amusing. \u201cYou know all them fancy words, Teach, but you aren\u2019t so smart when it comes to cars, are you?\u201d</p><p>Brynn was more than willing to admit it. \u201cIs it serious?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Emilio shrugged. \u201cI haven\u2019t got a clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you knew something about cars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but I ain\u2019t no Mr. Goodwrench.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks anyway, Emilio. I appreciate your help.\u201d He\u2019d done a lot more than her fellow teachers. Most had walked right past her.</p><p>Brynn closed the hood and locked up the car. She didn\u2019t want to leave it, but she didn\u2019t have any choice. Its hood shut with a bang that echoed through the darkening afternoon. She swung the strap of her purse over her shoulder, and with her back stiff, not knowing where to turn, she started out of the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cWhere you going?\u201d Emilio asked, bouncing the basketball and weaving it in and out of his legs as he walked alongside her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better get a tow truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother can do that.\u201d</p><p>Brynn paused. \u201cYour brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoberto. He\u2019s owns a mechanic shop. If you want, I\u2019ll take you there. He\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d</p><p>Frankly, Brynn wished Emilio had said something about his brother sooner. \u201cThat would be great.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well, remember how much I helped you the next time you\u2019re tempted to have me suspended.\u201d</p><p>The three-block walk took only a matter of minutes. Brynn spied Roberto\u2019s shop when they turned the corner. It looked as if the garage had once been a neighborhood gas station. The corners of the cement building were chipped and the entire structure was badly in need of a fresh coat of paint.</p><p>Emilio opened the glass front door and walked inside. \u201cRoberto!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>His brother\u2019s reply was muffled.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the garage,\u201d Emilio said, gesturing to the narrow doorway that led to a large open area that served as the repair shop. Brynn followed her student inside.</p><p>\u201cI drummed up some business for you,\u201d Emilio announced proudly, and motioned toward Brynn.</p><p>Roberto Alcantara slowly unfolded from a quarter panel of the blue Metro and reached for the pink rag tucked inside his coveralls pocket.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mr. Alcantara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall him Roberto,\u201d Emilio insisted. \u201cThis is Miss Cassidy,\u201d he continued, looking well pleased with himself. \u201cShe\u2019s the teacher I was telling you about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>Roberto nodded and wiped his hands. His face remained emotionless.</p><p>\u201cMs. Cassidy\u2019s having car troubles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy car won\u2019t start,\u201d she elaborated. \u201cI doubt that it\u2019s the battery. It ran perfectly fine this morning . . . at least I thought it did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know anything about cars,\u201d Emilio inserted. \u201cHer specialty is dangling particles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParticiples,\u201d Brynn corrected.</p><p>Emilio chuckled. \u201cSee what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased to meet you, Miss Cassidy,\u201d Roberto said coolly, and tossed the rag onto his tool bench.</p><p>\u201cI left my car in the school parking lot.\u201d She twisted her arm around and pointed in the direction of the school, which was completely unnecessary. Roberto Alcantara knew very well where the high school was.</p><p>Roberto said something to Emilio in Spanish. Emilio nodded quickly, then turned abruptly and hurried out of the garage. Within a matter of a minute she heard the youth talking on the phone, again in Spanish. Before he left, he collected her car keys.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had Emilio call for a tow truck,\u201d Roberto informed her. \u201cHe\u2019ll meet the driver over at the school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I can\u2019t tell you how much I appreciate your help.\u201d</p><p>Roberto said nothing.</p><p>Without being obvious, Brynn studied Emilio\u2019s brother. Roberto was tall and lean. His skin was the color of warm honey, his eyes and hair as dark a shade of brown as she\u2019d ever seen. She guessed him to be around her own age, perhaps a year or two older. He wasn\u2019t openly hostile, but he did nothing to put her at ease. Every attempt at conversation was dead-ended.</p><p>As the minutes passed, the silence became more and more strained. Brynn wondered what she could have done to earn his disapproval, then realized it must be the incident with Emilio in the hall the first day she was at the school.</p><p>\u201cI imagine you\u2019re upset with me because I was the one responsible for Emilio\u2019s suspension,\u201d she tried again. She wouldn\u2019t apologize, but she was prepared to state her side of the case. If he was willing to listen, that was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the least bit upset,\u201d he surprised her by answering. \u201cEmilio knows the rules. He deserved what he got.\u201d He returned to working on the Metro and ignored her.</p><p>The next time he straightened, Brynn asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t like me, do you?\u201d Normally she wouldn\u2019t be so confrontational, but it had been one of those days. If she\u2019d done something to offend him, she wanted to know about it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he concurred.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind telling me why?\u201d</p><p>Apparently this was just the doorway he\u2019d been waiting to walk through. Roberto met her look brazenly and continued. \u201cBecause you\u2019re filling my brother\u2019s head with nonsense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d Brynn struggled not to sound defensive and doubted that she\u2019d succeeded.</p><p>He flung his arm in the air. \u201cAll your talk about the importance of an education. A high school diploma isn\u2019t going to help Emilio any more than it did me. Tell me, Miss Cassidy, exactly how is the history of World War Two going to feed a family? Will reading about Anne Frank get him a decent job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes . . . well, not directly,\u201d she faltered. \u201cEducation is the answer for Emilio.\u201d She couldn\u2019t believe Roberto would say such a thing.</p><p>\u201cEmilio would be better off if he dropped out of school now and learned a trade.\u201d He turned his back on her and appeared to be looking for something on his tool bench. He carelessly tossed aside a wrench and reached for another.</p><p>\u201cI soundly disagree,\u201d Brynn said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your right.\u201d</p><p>In all her years, Brynn had never heard anyone discourage someone from an education. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you actually want your brother to quit school. Surely your parents object to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the only family Emilio\u2019s got,\u201d Roberto announced.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that, especially if you think he shouldn\u2019t complete his education.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI nearly had him convinced to come work with me here in the garage, but then you arrived and all of a sudden he\u2019s talking about goals and dreams and other such nonsense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t nonsense,\u201d she argued.</p><p>Roberto threw down a rag and shook his head. \u201cNo matter what happens, my brother and I will live and die in this neighborhood. All your talk isn\u2019t going to change one damn thing.\u201d</p><p>Hannah knew it was coming. The minute Carl arrived with his parents, following synagogue, she knew. He\u2019d come to ask her to be his wife. Come to stake his claim. She didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d chosen now; then again, perhaps she did. Hannah knew that Carl had experienced pressure from his own family. They had dated several months now, and it was time to make a decision. He taught at the local Hebrew academy, and his position there was secure, despite his differences with the headmaster.</p><p>Together with her mother and father, Hannah led Carl\u2019s family into the compact living room. An expectant silence settled over the group as the two sets of parents exchanged happy glances.</p><p>Carl looked to Hannah, and she read the apology in his eyes. He hadn\u2019t wanted it to be like this, either. He would have preferred for them to speak privately first, but like her, he was caught in the trap of obligation and family tradition.</p><p>\u201cCarl.\u201d The rabbi looked to his son.</p><p>Carl cleared his throat. \u201cHannah and I have been seeing each other exclusively now for several months,\u201d he began. His hands were clasped in his lap, and he seemed to be as uncomfortable with this as Hannah was. \u201cIt should come as no surprise that I have deep feelings for your daughter.\u201d</p><p>David and Ruth smiled and nodded.</p><p>Hannah read the delight in their eyes. This was their dream for her, what they\u2019d been anxiously waiting to happen for weeks. If anything, they seemed surprised it had taken this long.</p><p>\u201cOur Hannah has deep feelings for Carl as well,\u201d her father assured the rabbi and his wife. He looked to his daughter for confirmation.</p><p>Hannah had no option but to agree, and really, it wasn\u2019t a stretch of the truth. She did care for Carl. He had been both generous and considerate.</p><p>\u201cI have a good job and make a respectable income,\u201d Carl said.</p><p>Her father nodded.</p><p>\u201cI can afford to care for Hannah.\u201d</p><p>Again her father confirmed his approval with a quick nod.</p><p>The room went silent as everyone waited with breathless anticipation for what was to come next.</p><p>\u201cWith your permission, David and Ruth,\u201d Carl continued, his voice low and firm, \u201cI would like to ask Hannah to be my wife.\u201d</p><p>Hannah watched as her sensible mother dissolved into tears of happiness and, perhaps, relief. Her father\u2019s face beamed with love and pride.</p><p>David cleared his throat as if to say his words were those of importance. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t ask for a better man for our only child. You have our permission and our heartfelt approval. May God deeply bless you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannah?\u201d Carl turned his attention to her.</p><p>Five people looked to her. She held their dreams in the palm of her hand. With everything in her she wanted to ask Carl to give her time before she decided. But to do so now would embarrass him and deeply disappoint their families. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHannah?\u201d her mother asked softly.</p><p>Hannah glanced toward her parents. All her life she\u2019d done as they wanted. She\u2019d been a good daughter, an obedient child.</p><p>\u201cOh, Carl,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Her mother dabbed at her eyes. Carl\u2019s mother sniffled.</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more honored than to be your wife.\u201d</p><p>The tension in the room evaporated as Carl\u2019s and her parents leapt to their feet and hugged each other. The only two not embracing were Carl and Hannah.</p><p>Carl moved to her side and knelt on the floor next to her chair. His eyes held hers captive. \u201cI\u2019ll make you a good husband, Hannah.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her gaze. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be a good wife.\u201d</p><p>Joshua glanced at his watch and was surprised at the time. He\u2019d been held up in court earlier that morning and been playing catch-up the rest of the day. Earlier he\u2019d decided to stop off at the deli and be sure Hannah had received his gift. Frankly he\u2019d been surprised not to hear from her before now.</p> <p>It came as something of a surprise the way Hannah had filled his mind and his heart. For too many years he\u2019d been whizzing down the fast lane of life, building his career and making a name for himself.</p><p>Then one morning, out of the blue, he\u2019d woken with a hollow feeling in the pit of his stomach. This feeling, this emptiness, was something his grandmother\u2019s cooking wasn\u2019t going to satisfy.</p><p>It was then Joshua realized that what he was missing was a wife and family. He knew his mother had been wanting him to marry for a good long while. Only he had a certain type of woman in mind, and he didn\u2019t know if such a woman existed in this modern age.</p><p>First and foremost he sought a woman who shared his faith. One who would stand devotedly at his side through the years. A woman who would make his dreams hers and allow him to be part of hers. One who was kind and gentle. Loving and tender. Sensible.</p><p>He\u2019d searched for months for this paragon of virtue, until he was convinced a woman such as this no longer existed.</p><p>Then he\u2019d met Hannah.</p> <p>After their first afternoon together, he\u2019d realized she was exactly the type of woman he\u2019d been longing to meet. To think all this time she\u2019d been right under his nose. The local deli owner\u2019s daughter.</p><p>Joshua reached for his coat, and after telling his secretary where he\u2019d be, he headed toward what many in New York considered to be the best deli in town.</p><p>When he was less than a block away from the deli, Joshua spied Hannah. She was walking with an older woman, whom he assumed must be her mother. It was hard not to raise his arm and attract her attention the way he had at their previous meeting. But since she was advancing toward him, there didn\u2019t seem to be much point.</p><p>Joshua frowned when he noticed Hannah wasn\u2019t wearing the gloves he\u2019d had delivered. Then he noticed her eyes. How easy she was to read. Whatever she was doing didn\u2019t please her. Even from this distance he felt her resistance.</p><p>Just then she looked up, and he caught her gaze. Briefly her eyes widened with alarm and she gnawed on her lower lip as though she weren\u2019t sure what to do.</p><p>Without her saying a word, Joshua received her message. She didn\u2019t want him to greet her. Silently she pleaded with him to walk on past. It offended him, but he didn\u2019t question her request.</p><p>Without a word they strolled past each other like total strangers. Three steps on the other side of Hannah, Joshua turned, hoping for some telltale sign that would clue him to what was wrong.</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder, and in that briefest of seconds, Joshua read her eyes. She was grateful. Later, when she could, she promised silently, she would explain everything.</p> <p>It probably had something to do with what she\u2019d told him the day of the parade. Her parents had been involved in a frivolous lawsuit. The fact that her family didn\u2019t take kindly to attorneys wouldn\u2019t dissuade him. He was very much interested in knowing Hannah better. Once her family had an opportunity to know him, they\u2019d be willing to overlook the fact that he was an attorney. Joshua smiled to himself.</p><p>He would be patient, because Hannah Morganstern was well worth the effort. After all, he\u2019d been looking for her most of his adult life.</p><p>\u201cThis must be old home week,\u201d Michelle said as she walked into the apartment and tossed the mail on the kitchen table. \u201cThere\u2019s another letter with a postmark from Custer, Montana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is?\u201d Dressed in her slip and standing in front of the ironing board, Jenny set aside the iron and walked over to the table. She reached for the envelope and read the return address. \u201cIt\u2019s from my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you hear from your mother,\u201d Michelle complained as she shucked off her coat and scarf. \u201cIt\u2019s been three months since my mother last wrote me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she calls once a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>But Jenny understood what her friend was saying. It was a relief to get something in the mail other than bills.</p><p>She opened the envelope and withdrew the letter. It was exactly what she expected. Her mother had broken her silence and joined Trey to ask her to come home for the holidays.</p><p>It hurt more than words could voice, having to explain that she couldn\u2019t leave New York. Jenny had long since run out of money, out of excuses, and, worse yet, out of ideas.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d she say?\u201d Michelle asked. Her roommate stood in front of the open refrigerator and stared at its meager contents. Rather than explain, Jenny handed the single sheet of stationery to her friend. Michelle scanned the page, then raised her eyes to Jenny.</p><p>\u201cYour mother wants you to come home for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Jenny sank onto the sofa and tucked her feet beneath her. \u201cChristmas has always been so special with our family. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met anyone who could put on a spread the way Mom does. She makes this incredible sage dressing for the turkey, and the scent of it fills the house.\u201d She closed her eyes, and the memory was so powerful, she could almost smell the pungent herbs right then.</p><p>\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a way you could manage to make it home,\u201d Michelle said sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t,\u201d Jenny said, unwilling even to listen to suggestions. No one needed to tell her that she\u2019d done this to herself.</p><p>Christmas with her mom and dad and little brother. A lump formed in her throat.</p><p>Christmas on the range. Snow glistening in the moonlight, sleigh rides every December. Decorating the tree together had long been a family tradition. Her father would set a pot of wassail to warm over the fireplace, and they\u2019d sing carols while they strung the lights and added the tinsel. The ranch hands and neighbors would stop over for a cup of her father\u2019s special brew. Trey came every year.</p><p>\u201cJenny?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes popped open. \u201cSorry. I guess I got carried away there for a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t your family come to see you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom and Dad?\u201d Jenny supposed she should have considered that a long time ago, but try as she might she couldn\u2019t picture her parents in New York. To the best of her knowledge they\u2019d never been more than three hundred miles away from the ranch. Their lives revolved around the care and feeding of a thousand head of cattle. It would be unheard-of for her father to leave the ranch unattended.</p><p>There\u2019d been a time when Jenny hated the mere mention of the word beef. How eager she\u2019d been to escape to the big city and find her way in the world. How eager she\u2019d been to disassociate herself from the Flying L Ranch.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear anything from Peterman?\u201d she asked Michelle, needing to change the subject before she became downright maudlin.</p><p>\u201cNot a word. Rumor has it he\u2019s looking for a particular kind of girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Jenny feigned interest. It went without saying that whatever character type the famous director sought wasn\u2019t likely to be Jenny. She had lost count of the number of times she\u2019d auditioned for John Peterman. He hadn\u2019t chosen her yet, and she doubted he would this time.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know when she\u2019d started all this stinking thinking. About the time she\u2019d told the first lie to her parents. Negative thoughts had crowded her mind ever since.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t shake the feeling you\u2019re going to be offered one of the major roles,\u201d Michelle said. \u201cMark my words, Jenny Lancaster. We\u2019re both headed for Broadway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the saddest thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Mercy told her two friends. \u201cJenny wants nothing more than to go home for the holidays, and can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely there\u2019s a way we can help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m convinced there is.\u201d Goodness spoke with utter confidence. \u201cAll we may need to do is pull a few strings. That shouldn\u2019t be so difficult.\u201d</p><p>Mercy smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing that for years, haven\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should make it impossible for Jenny to refuse her mother.\u201d</p><p>Mercy looked to the former guardian angel. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Shirley pointed to the Thanksgiving card tucked in Jenny\u2019s bedroom mirror. \u201cPerhaps all we really need to do is give her a good enough excuse to head home.\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>Jenny didn\u2019t want to do it. Her heart ached every time she thought about refusing her mother\u2019s plea. The list of fabricated excuses was as long as her arm.</p><p>She waited until she had the apartment to herself and then sat down at the table. She bolstered herself with a cup of hot chocolate and a plate of butter cookies. With pen in hand, she wrote.</p><p>Dearest Mom and Dad,</p><p>You don\u2019t know how it pains me to tell you I won\u2019t make it home for the holidays. I love you both more than words can say. I think of you every day. Know that my heart will be with you, but this is the price of success. . . .</p><p>Jenny wadded up the letter and unceremoniously tossed it into the garbage. She tried again, and after six or seven lines the second sheet followed the path of the first.</p><p>A half hour later, the table was nearly obliterated with discarded attempts. It hadn\u2019t been this difficult to answer Trey\u2019s card. Her brief note to her former neighbor had been cheerful and witty when she\u2019d sent along her regrets.</p><p>Anyone who knew her well might have been able to read between the lines of her lighthearted message. But not Trey, she decided. Her witty note would amuse him.</p><p>In the end, Jenny penned three short lines to her parents and left it at that. She couldn\u2019t come. She was sorry, and she\u2019d miss them terribly.</p><p>Not once did she mention the Off Broadway production she\u2019d told them she was in. Jenny refused to perpetrate the lie any further than she had already.</p><p>By the time Michelle returned from her errands, Jenny was in a real funk. Depressed and miserable, she battled off a case of the blues, determined not to get caught in the trap of feeling sorry for herself.</p><p>\u201cYou know what we need?\u201d her friend said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little fun. It\u2019s the season of joy, and yet here we are, moping around waiting for the phone to ring.\u201d Their agent hadn\u2019t called, and Jenny didn\u2019t care what people said. No news was not good news. No news was no news. And this time the waiting had never seemed more interminable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat if we had a party?\u201d Michelle asked.</p><p>\u201cA Christmas party,\u201d Jenny added, warming to the idea. \u201cThat\u2019s perfect.\u201d Then reality set in. \u201cBut how would we possibly feed all our friends?\u201d It was difficult enough to scrounge up meals for the two of them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make it a potluck,\u201d Michelle suggested. \u201cAll we need supply are the drinks, plus plates and silverware. Between us we could manage that, couldn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure we could.\u201d Jenny\u2019s nod was eager. Her spirits lifted just thinking about the celebration. She needed this, needed something to take her mind off how much she would miss Montana. \u201cWe can make the invitations ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s hand them out. That way we could save on postage,\u201d Michelle said, offering another money-saving idea.</p><p>\u201cWho should we invite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBill and Susan,\u201d Michelle suggested.</p><p>The couple had met in drama school and had married that summer. Jenny and Michelle had been bridesmaids. Jenny had joked about how the two of them always seemed to end up as bridesmaids.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Cliff?\u201d Jenny asked.</p> <p>\u201cAbby, too.\u201d</p><p>The list continued until they were afraid they\u2019d forget, so they decided to write them all down.</p><p>Michelle sat at the table and reached for a pen. \u201cGood grief, what happened here? It looks like a paper massacre.\u201d</p><p>The tightness gripped Jenny\u2019s throat. \u201cI finally wrote my parents and told them I wouldn\u2019t be home.\u201d Just saying the words aloud increased the ache.</p><p>\u201cNext year you\u2019ll be with your family,\u201d Michelle said with confidence.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Jenny said, forcing herself to think positive thoughts. Surely living in the same city in which Norman Vincent Peale had preached his philosophy of positive thinking should teach her something. Yet here she was doing it again: stinking thinking.</p> <p>\u201cBill and Susan,\u201d Michelle mumbled as she repeated the names of their mutual friends. \u201cAbby. Cliff. John.\u201d</p><p>The phone pealed and they froze.</p><p>Michelle looked to Jenny.</p><p>Jenny to Michelle.</p><p>\u201cYou answer it,\u201d her roommate instructed.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Jenny insisted, shaking her head. It had been like this all week. The instant the phone jingled they hoped, prayed, it was Irene, their agent. If it wasn\u2019t Irene, then perhaps it was the casting director and maybe even the great and mighty John Peterman himself. It wasn\u2019t likely, but they could dream.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably some schmuck wanting to sell us aluminum siding,\u201d Michelle joked.</p><p>\u201cOr someone doing a survey on cat food.\u201d</p> <p>But Jenny noticed that neither one of them took their eyes away from the kitchen telephone.</p><p>Michelle edged herself from the chair on the third ring and reached the phone. \u201cHello, this is Jenny and Michelle\u2019s place,\u201d she said cheerfully in a perfect rendition of the efficient secretary.</p><p>Jenny studied her friend. Afraid to hope. Afraid to care.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for you,\u201d Michelle stated, and handed her the receiver. Then she mouthed, \u201cIt\u2019s a man.\u201d</p><p>Jenny pointed her finger at her heart, wondering if she\u2019d misunderstood. \u201cFor me?\u201d</p><p>Michelle nodded.</p><p>She took the phone and said in a friendly but professional-sounding voice, \u201cThis is Jenny Lancaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Jenny.\u201d</p><p>Trey.</p><p>Jenny couldn\u2019t have been more shocked if it\u2019d been Andrew Lloyd Webber himself, wanting her to star in his next musical.</p><p>\u201cTrey!\u201d she said, barely managing to hide her shock.</p><p>\u201cI got your note,\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cIt was a surprise to get your Thanksgiving card,\u201d she said, holding the receiver with both hands. She felt lightheaded and wasn\u2019t sure if it was the shock of Trey\u2019s call or the fact that she hadn\u2019t eaten all day.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t coming home for the holidays.\u201d</p><p>Trey, her family. Everyone seemed to be pressuring her. It felt as if the walls were closing in around her. \u201cI can\u2019t come,\u201d she told him, unable to disguise her own bitter disappointment. \u201cI want to be there. More than anything, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what your note said. So the bright lights of the city have blinded you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She longed to tell him how she hungered for the peace and solitude of Montana. New York City held its own excitement, its own energy. So often she\u2019d walked down the crowded avenues and felt a rhythm, a cadence, that all but sang up from the asphalt. For three years she\u2019d marched to that beat and hummed its special brand of music.</p><p>Yet the lone cry in the barren hills of home played longingly to her soul, its melody haunting her.</p><p>\u201cYour family misses you,\u201d Trey said, tightening the screws of her regrets.</p><p>Jenny bit into her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cI miss you,\u201d Trey added.</p><p>Jenny\u2019s eyes flew open. Trey, the man who\u2019d invaded her dreams for weeks, admitted to missing her. He\u2019d as much as said he wanted her home.</p><p>Regrets clamored against her chest, their fists sharp and pain-filled. \u201cI can\u2019t come,\u201d she whispered miserably.</p><p>Her words were met with silence.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t or won\u2019t?\u201d he asked starkly.</p><p>Brynn Cassidy crossed the street in front of Manhattan High and St. Philip\u2019s Cathedral. She found Father Grady, the gray-haired priest who\u2019d become her friend, in the vestibule.</p><p>\u201cHello, Father,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBrynn, it\u2019s good to see you, my girl.\u201d His green Irish eyes lit up with warm delight.</p><p>\u201cI got your message. You wanted to see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Come over to the rectory and I\u2019ll have Mrs. Houghton brew us a pot of tea.\u201d</p><p>Brynn glanced at her watch. She enjoyed visiting with Father Grady, but the older priest liked to talk and she didn\u2019t have time that afternoon.</p><p>Father Grady\u2019s eyes followed hers. \u201cDo you have an appointment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to stop off at Roberto Alcantara\u2019s this afternoon and pick up my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Roberto well,\u201d Father Grady said, and motioned for her to precede him out of the church. \u201cHe\u2019s a fine young man.\u201d He paused to glance her way, and it seemed to Brynn that the priest was looking for her to elaborate. She didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cEmilio\u2019s in my class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, Emilio. Roberto\u2019s done his best to keep his brother out of trouble. There haven\u2019t been problems with Emilio, have there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Brynn was quick to tell him.</p><p>Father Grady\u2019s face relaxed.</p><p>Brynn lowered her gaze. It wasn\u2019t Emilio she\u2019d clashed with, but Roberto. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Roberto doesn\u2019t think much of me.\u201d</p><p>Father Grady opened the door to the rectory. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re mistaken.\u201d</p><p>Brynn followed him inside. She preferred not to tell him about their brief confrontation. It rankled still. Roberto Alcantara had been both rude and unreasonable. But more than that, he\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I have time for tea,\u201d she reiterated when she realized that Father Grady fully intended for her to stay and chat anyway.</p><p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d He escorted Brynn into the parlor and left her while he went in search of Mrs. Houghton, the elderly housekeeper who cared for Father Grady and the bishop when he was in residence.</p><p>Father Grady returned shortly with a tray and two cups. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d be able to stop over this afternoon,\u201d he said as he set the tray on the coffee table. He handed Brynn a delicate china cup and took one himself before sitting across from her on the velvet settee. \u201cThe church is sponsoring a dance this Friday evening for the youth group.\u201d</p><p>Brynn had seen the posters. \u201cI\u2019ve heard several of the kids mention it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe generally have a good turnout.\u201d</p><p>Brynn was sure that was true.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering,\u201d Father Grady said, studying her above the china cup, \u201cif you\u2019d agree to be one of the chaperones.\u201d</p><p>The request took Brynn by surprise, although in retrospect she supposed it shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThe children are quite fond of you,\u201d he added as if he felt flattering her would be necessary. \u201cModesto Diaz mentioned your name the other day. He said . . .\u201d Father Grady paused, and his eyes sparkled with humor.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Brynn prodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, Modesto did say you were a little weird, but that he liked you anyway.\u201d</p><p>Brynn was sure her students didn\u2019t quite know what to make of her teaching methods.</p><p>\u201cI realize it\u2019s an imposition asking you at this late date,\u201d Father Grady continued. \u201cI\u2019d consider it a personal favor if you could come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to chaperone the dance,\u201d Brynn murmured.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Father Grady said, and set down his teacup. \u201cTell me what happened between you and Roberto Alcantara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d she said, preferring to make light of their differences. \u201cActually Roberto\u2019s been most helpful. My car broke down and he\u2019s fixing it for me.\u201d</p><p>Father Grady said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI was on my way to pick it up now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoberto\u2019s been through some difficult times,\u201d the priest told her. \u201cI\u2019m not at liberty to tell you all the circumstances, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please, no. I wouldn\u2019t want you to break a confidence. It\u2019s nothing, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Roberto offended you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t. We had a difference of opinion.\u201d</p><p>Father Grady seemed relieved. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that. If you do find him disagreeable, all I ask is that you give him a bit of slack. He\u2019s a good man. I\u2019d vouch for him any day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure what you say is true.\u201d Brynn stood and set the teacup back on the tray. \u201cNow I really must be going.\u201d</p><p>Father Grady escorted her to the front door. \u201cI\u2019ll see you Friday evening, then, around seven?\u201d</p><p>Brynn nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>The priest\u2019s eyes brightened with a smile. \u201cThank you, Brynn, I promise you won\u2019t regret this.\u201d</p><p>Brynn briskly walked the few blocks to Roberto Alcantara\u2019s garage. Earlier that afternoon, Emilio had personally delivered the message that her car was ready for her. The youth made sure the entire class heard him, as though the two of them had a personal business arrangement. Brynn had been forced to conceal her irritation.</p><p>As the afternoon progressed, she discovered she wasn\u2019t looking forward to another encounter with Emilio\u2019s older brother. The man was way off base. It was impossible to reason with anyone who regarded education as a waste of time. The fact that he\u2019d actually urged his younger brother to drop out of school was nothing short of criminal.</p><p>\u201cYo, Miss Cassidy.\u201d Emilio, Modesto, and a few more of the boys from her class drove past her slowly and waved.</p><p>Brynn returned the gesture automatically. It wasn\u2019t until they\u2019d turned the corner that she realized the boys were joyriding in her car.</p><p>Brynn bristled and hurried the last block to Roberto\u2019s. When she reached the garage, she stormed in the door. \u201cEmilio\u2019s driving around in my car.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Roberto, who was working on another car, straightened. \u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I gave him the keys myself.\u201d</p><p>The man had a way of flustering her unlike anyone she\u2019d ever encountered. \u201cWell, I want it back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get it.\u201d He returned to the truck he was working on, disappearing behind the hood.</p><p>\u201cDo you generally allow Emilio to ride around in your customers\u2019 cars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His answer was clipped and didn\u2019t invite further inquiries.</p><p>His attitude\u2014in fact, everything about Roberto\u2014irritated Brynn. \u201cI want my car returned,\u201d she insisted, her voice raised and tight. No matter what Father Grady claimed, it was plain to her that this man didn\u2019t have one shred of responsibility.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll have it.\u201d</p> <p>Brynn crossed her arms and started to pace. Twice she made a show of looking at her watch.</p><p>\u201cEmilio will be back any moment,\u201d Roberto said, continuing to work on another vehicle.</p><p>Bent over the engine as he was, Brynn couldn\u2019t see his face, but she had the distinct impression the mechanic was smiling. Her irritation amused him. That infuriated Brynn all the more.</p><p>\u201cI want you to know that I don\u2019t appreciate being kept waiting.\u201d</p><p>Roberto straightened and reached for an oil rag; his dark, intense eyes meshed with hers. \u201cI\u2019m not one of your students, Miss Cassidy, so there\u2019s no need to yell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not yelling.\u201d She realized she was and lowered her voice immediately.</p> <p>Roberto grinned broadly. \u201cI suppose you\u2019d like to send me to the principal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha!\u201d Her arm flew out and she pointed at him with her index finger, wagging it while she gathered her thoughts. \u201cI thought as much. You blame me because your brother was suspended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary. Emilio knows not to fight on school grounds. What is it the law enforcement people are so fond of quoting? Do the crime, pay the time. My brother deserved what he got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you blame me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just wish you\u2019d quit filling my brother\u2019s head with garbage.\u201d</p><p>Brynn clenched her jaw in an effort not to argue. This was the same mine-riddled ground they\u2019d covered earlier. Brynn had no desire to do battle with Roberto a second time.</p><p>From the corner of her eye, she saw her car pull into an empty parking slot in front of the garage.</p><p>\u201cYo, Miss Cassidy,\u201d Emilio called out. \u201cYour car\u2019s running like a dream.\u201d</p> <p>Despite her misgivings, Brynn managed a smile. \u201cIf I could please have my bill,\u201d she said with stiff politeness.</p><p>Roberto gestured toward his brother. \u201cEmilio will take care of that.\u201d</p><p>Brynn hesitated before leaving the garage for the small outer office where Emilio stood. Although Roberto had been deliberately rude, she felt obligated to him. \u201cI want you to know I appreciate your help.\u201d</p><p>Involved once again with another vehicle, Roberto didn\u2019t bother to answer. It was almost as if he were ignoring her. His lack of a response to her peace offering offended her pride. Swallowing the small hurt, Brynn brushed the hair from her face.</p><p>\u201cYour car runs like new,\u201d Emilio told her as he stepped behind the cash register. \u201cRoberto asked me to test-drive it around the block. I hope you don\u2019t mind that I let a couple of my posse join me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour is more than a couple,\u201d she informed him primly.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d the youth said with a flash of pearly white teeth. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t every day that we can say we rode in a teacher\u2019s car.\u201d</p><p>Brynn decided it was best to not comment.</p><p>Emilio located the work order for her vehicle and scanned its contents. Brynn had been waiting for this moment, praying that the expense wouldn\u2019t wipe out the meager remainder of her budget for the month. The Escort had well over two hundred thousand miles on it and thus far had been relatively problem free. With the dread building up inside her, she opened her purse and took out her checkbook.</p><p>Something didn\u2019t appear to be right, because Emilio looked up from the bill. \u201cI need to ask Roberto something,\u201d he said, and walked around from behind the counter. In the other room, the two brothers talked in hushed tones.</p><p>Emilio returned, wearing a wide grin. \u201cIt\u2019s on the house,\u201d he announced.</p><p>Brynn wasn\u2019t sure she understood. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Pride gleamed in the youth\u2019s dark eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe us anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t let you do that. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoberto insists.\u201d</p><p>Still Brynn argued. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gift, Miss Cassidy,\u201d Emilio said with a deep sigh of frustration. \u201cDidn\u2019t you ever learn you\u2019re not supposed to question someone when they give you a gift? Some lady with manners wrote it up in a book. You read all the time . . . you must have read that.\u201d</p><p>Brynn was uncertain. \u201cLet me at least pay for any parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d The teenager held up both hands as though she were holding him up.</p><p>\u201cBut carburetors can be expensive.\u201d She didn\u2019t want Roberto absorbing the cost of this.</p><p>\u201cRoberto says he found another carburetor at the junkyard and got it for next to nothing. Besides, he let me do most of the work myself.\u201d His dark eyes pleaded with her to accept this small gift.</p><p>\u201cEmilio, I don\u2019t know how to thank you.\u201d</p><p>His face erupted in a wide smile. \u201cI\u2019ll think of something.\u201d</p><p>Roberto shouted from the other room, and Emilio\u2019s smart smile disappeared. \u201cThink nothing of it, Miss Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you both again.\u201d Brynn felt like a fool for having made such an issue of Emilio driving her vehicle. She glanced toward the garage, but Roberto was bent over the side of the truck, busy at work. \u201cTell your brother that I\u2019m grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Emilio followed her outside and held open her car door for her.</p><p>When she couldn\u2019t find her car keys, she eyed the youth. A desperate look came over him, and he slapped his hands over his shirt and pants pockets, then laughed and withdrew them from his hip pocket. \u201cI had you worried there, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Brynn rolled her eyes, then started the engine. As Emilio had said earlier, it purred like new. Her car sounded better than it had in years. She backed out of the driveway. It was as she started down the street that she noticed Roberto Alcantara watching her from inside the building.</p><p>He owed her an apology, Roberto reasoned. He\u2019d been angry and frustrated the day they\u2019d met, and he\u2019d taken his irritation out on her. True, he believed the things he\u2019d said, but generally he kept his opinions to himself. It had helped relieve his irritation to sound off at Emilio\u2019s teacher; but it hadn\u2019t been fair.</p><p>An hour before he\u2019d met Brynn, Roberto had learned his offer to lease a building in another neighborhood had been rejected. It hadn\u2019t been the first time a landlord had refused to rent to him. Naturally he\u2019d been given some flimsy excuse, but Roberto had learned long ago the real reason. No one wanted a Hispanic taking up residence nearby.</p><p>Brynn Cassidy was everything Emilio had said. Bright. Intelligent. Pretty. Roberto feared his younger brother was half in love with her himself. But this spunky teacher was off-limits to the both of them, and Roberto knew it. It would be best if he never saw her again.</p><p>Funny how a woman could be so dangerous; but Roberto had recognized it from the first moment they\u2019d met. Brynn Cassidy just might teach him to dream, too.</p><p>Friday evening Brynn arrived at the gymnasium behind St. Philip\u2019s. She walked into the gaily decorated room and stopped to admire the decorations. Red and green streamers were looped across the ceiling from one end of the room to the other. A refreshment table was set up alongside the folded bleachers.</p><p>\u201cHello, Miss Cassidy.\u201d The first one to greet her was Suzie Chang, who looked exceptionally pretty in a dark blue silk pants suit.</p><p>\u201cOh, Suzie, you look so nice.\u201d</p><p>The Chinese girl lowered her head and blushed. \u201cSo do you.\u201d</p><p>Brynn hadn\u2019t been exactly sure what to wear and had opted for a blouse and skirt and patent-leather flats. Although she\u2019d attended a number of school dances at St. Mary\u2019s, she\u2019d never actually served as a chaperone. Generally the girls\u2019 school relied on parents and members of the PTA.</p><p>\u201cMiss Cassidy,\u201d Emilio called. He helped himself to a handful of cookies. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a chaperone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s cool. So\u2019s my brother.\u201d</p><p>Brynn hadn\u2019t recognized Roberto without his coveralls. She hadn\u2019t given Roberto much notice before, but now . . . caught by his piercing dark eyes, Brynn found it difficult to look away.</p><p>\u201cHello, Roberto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Cassidy.\u201d He nodded politely in her direction.</p><p>The music started. It came from a sound system with large speakers that blared from the front of the stage. No one seemed to want to be the first one on the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cHey, you two,\u201d Emilio said. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you start the dancing or something?\u201d</p><p>Hannah needed to talk to Joshua. It was important that she return the gloves as soon as possible. It was wrong of her to have kept them this long. Then to walk past him on the street and pretend that she didn\u2019t know him was a terrible insult. She\u2019d witnessed for herself the surprise and confusion in his gaze. Yet she was forever grateful that he\u2019d read her silent message and hadn\u2019t greeted her. Hannah didn\u2019t know how she would explain knowing him to her mother.</p><p>For herself, Hannah was both bewildered and guilty, and she felt like a coward. It was unfair to Joshua to lead him to believe that she was free to care for him. Unfair to Carl, who\u2019d courted her faithfully these many months. She\u2019d juggled with her conscience until she couldn\u2019t think straight any longer.</p><p>\u201cI do wish we weren\u2019t doing this,\u201d Hannah said to her mother.</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d Ruth questioned. \u201cBuying my daughter a trousseau? Don\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t set the wedding date yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will soon enough.\u201d In the eyes of her parents she was all but married to Carl Rabinsky.</p><p>\u201cYour father and I have patiently waited all these years for a man who was worthy of you.\u201d</p><p>A lifetime of accepting what her parents felt was right was what helped Hannah hold her tongue.</p><p>\u201cSuch a wedding you\u2019ll have,\u201d Ruth promised, her eyes alight with excitement.</p><p>Hannah found she couldn\u2019t look at her mother.</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s already talking about the food for the reception. I promise you it will be one that people will talk about for years to come. You are our only child. God\u2019s gift to us. Our joy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, what if I don\u2019t love Carl?\u201d</p><p>Her mother hesitated, but for only a moment. \u201cNonsense. I know you, Hannah, you wouldn\u2019t have agreed to be his wife if you didn\u2019t love him. Carl will make you a good husband. Every girl has doubts when it comes time to pledge her heart to one man.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019d met another man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d her mother demanded as if this were impossible.</p><p>\u201cSomeone I liked very much and would like to know better.\u201d</p><p>Her mother frowned and shook her head. \u201cYou won\u2019t. But if you do, then talk to Carl. Tell him your thoughts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will,\u201d Hannah promised, but she had the feeling that it would be even more difficult to discuss this matter with Carl than with her mother.</p><p>\u201cNow come along, we have lots to buy.\u201d</p><p>Hannah shuffled along beside her mother. Never had she dreamed that she would dread a shopping expedition the way she did this one.</p><p>It was in Saks Fifth Avenue that her mother stopped. \u201cShall we look at wedding dresses?\u201d Ruth asked, her eyes warm and gentle.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think that would be premature?\u201d Already Hannah\u2019s arms were burdened with packages. \u201cI\u2019m tired, Mama, can we go home?\u201d</p> <p>Ruth released a low sigh. \u201cYes, perhaps that would be for the best.\u201d</p><p>Outside once more, Hannah felt invigorated as the cold hit against her cheeks. She matched her steps with those of her mother, who walked along, humming softly to herself. It took Hannah a moment to realize where the melody was coming from.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re singing,\u201d Hannah commented.</p><p>Ruth laughed and nodded. \u201cSo I am. I do when I\u2019m especially happy.\u201d As they stopped for traffic, Ruth placed her hands against Hannah\u2019s pink cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be the most beautiful bride in all of New York. Mark my words, Hannah Morganstern. I get excited every time I think about planning your wedding.\u201d</p><p>Once they were back at the deli, Hannah escaped to her room. As soon as she could, she made an excuse to go out. Almost always she told her parents where she was going, but not this time.</p><p>When she arrived at Joshua\u2019s office the receptionist recognized her.</p> <p>\u201cIs Mr. Shadduck available?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The woman looked down at the schedule. \u201cHe left no more than a minute ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She wasn\u2019t able to hide her frustration.</p><p>\u201cYou might be able to catch him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Hannah rushed out of the office and hurried into the first available elevator. Her heart felt as though it would explode as she made her way to the front of the office building. On the sidewalk, she looked both ways and sighed with relief when she spied Joshua walking away from her, carrying a briefcase.</p><p>\u201cJoshua,\u201d she called.</p><p>He turned at the sound of her voice, and his face lit up with pleasure. \u201cHannah.\u201d He started toward her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said in a breathless rush. She planted her hand over her heart in an effort to regain her breath.</p> <p>Joshua wrapped his arm around her shoulders and steered her out of the heavy foot traffic. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d She\u2019d been unforgivably rude.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sit down a minute and talk this out,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>Hannah knew his idea was much better than her handing him back his gift in the middle of a New York sidewalk. At the same time, she feared that spending time with Joshua, even a short amount, would make it all the more difficult to do what she knew she must.</p><p>They strolled until Joshua pointed across the street to a five-star hotel famous for its afternoon teas.</p><p>Hannah wanted to protest that a cafe would serve just as well, but she wasn\u2019t given the opportunity. Before she could suggest some place else, Joshua had taken her by the arm. Together they raced across the street.</p><p>The hotel lobby was filled with polished crystal. Enormous chandeliers gleamed from above, their glittering lights transforming the entire area.</p><p>Huge floral wreaths decorated in gold lam\u00e9 bows hung from marble columns. The registration desk was checkered with poinsettias. Light music swirled about them like a cool autumn mist. Before Hannah had a chance to comment, she was led into a private dining room.</p><p>Before Joshua could give the man instructions, the waiter handed them a gold-tasseled menu. Joshua ordered the tea, and the other man quietly slipped away.</p><p>Joshua smiled at her. \u201cYou said there was something you wanted to tell me?\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>This meeting with Joshua was so much more difficult than Hannah thought it would be. But there was no help for it. She had to tell him she was engaged to Carl. To delay any longer would be a grave disservice to them both. As they sat in the elegant hotel restaurant waiting for the tea to be served, Hannah struggled to find the words.</p><p>\u201cJoshua,\u201d she said, dragging a deep breath through her lungs, her heart heavy.</p><p>\u201cYou received the gloves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you, but I can\u2019t accept\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoshua Shadduck?\u201d</p><p>Hannah was cut off midsentence by a well-dressed middle-aged woman who stopped at their table. Her gaze drifted from Joshua to Hannah, and her eyes were marked with warm approval.</p><p>\u201cGloria.\u201d Joshua stood and enthusiastically hugged the white-haired woman. He turned to Hannah. \u201cHannah Morganstern, meet Judge Fowler.\u201d</p><p>Impressed to meet a judge, Hannah smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m honored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to get in touch with you all week,\u201d Gloria said. Her gaze connected briefly with Hannah\u2019s once again. \u201cBut I can see that now isn\u2019t a good time. I promise I\u2019ll call you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to hearing from you,\u201d Joshua returned. Before he could reseat himself, the judge whispered something in his ear, then turned away.</p><p>Joshua grinned broadly, then explained to Hannah. \u201cShe approves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApproves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf you. She told me it was high time I . . . well, never mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoshua.\u201d A stout figure of a man approached their table next. \u201cBy George, it\u2019s good to see you,\u201d he said, sounding genuinely pleased.</p><p>\u201cHello, Tom.\u201d Although Hannah didn\u2019t know Joshua well, she could hear the frustration in his voice.</p><p>The other man studied Hannah with barely disguised admiration. His blue eyes twinkled. Before Joshua could introduce him properly, he stretched his hand across the table. \u201cTom Colfax,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHannah Morganstern,\u201d she replied, and they exchanged brief handshakes.</p><p>Tom\u2019s admiration was straightforward. \u201cI know this sounds like a worn-out line, but have we met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Hannah replied.</p><p>Tom rubbed the side of his jaw, then shook his head as if to say he was certain he\u2019d seen her someplace before.</p><p>The two men exchanged information, then Tom drifted away. He continued to wear a puzzled look and glanced over his shoulder once.</p><p>Joshua exhaled sharply. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>That was what Hannah had been struggling to tell him since they\u2019d met, but she hadn\u2019t been able to put it into words.</p><p>Joshua set the linen napkin on the table. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Hannah\u2019s first instinct was to argue, but she wasn\u2019t given the chance as she followed Joshua through the elegantly decorated lobby to the street outside. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked, a little breathless.</p><p>He turned as though he hadn\u2019t given the matter a second thought. \u201cI don\u2019t know. My apartment is a short walk from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said, her heart in her throat. \u201cI have to be back shortly.\u201d</p><p>Joshua\u2019s gaze narrowed as if to suggest he didn\u2019t believe her. \u201cAlready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She should have told him earlier and been done with it, but each time she shared his company it became more difficult. Now she found herself frantic to say what she must.</p><p>\u201cJoshua, please listen to me.\u201d She hardly sounded like herself. Her voice was tight with emotion as she brushed the hair from her cheek. She opened her purse and handed him the soft deerskin gloves. \u201cI can\u2019t keep these. They\u2019re a lovely, thoughtful gift, but I can\u2019t accept them.\u201d</p><p>He took the gloves, but his eyes revealed his disappointment. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>People wove their way around them, and her throat tightened with regret. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Joshua, so very sorry, but I\u2019m . . . There\u2019s someone else.\u201d That sounded much better than announcing she was engaged.</p><p>Joshua\u2019s face revealed nothing. \u201cThe man you were with at the parade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one who abandoned you?\u201d His feelings for Carl were more than clear.</p><p>\u201cCarl didn\u2019t abandon me, we simply lost each other.\u201d Carl hadn\u2019t deserted her, not on purpose, and she found it important that Joshua know that. Carl might have his faults, but nearly everyone was flawed in one way or another. He\u2019d gotten separated from her on Thanksgiving Day, and with so many people crowding the sidewalks, watching the parade, it had been impossible for him to find her again.</p><p>For a long time Joshua said nothing. Then, \u201cAre you going to marry him?\u201d</p><p>A definitive answer was her only recourse. Joshua deserved the truth. To hedge now might give him reason to believe there was a chance for them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t my question. I asked if you were going to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes . . . of course.\u201d But she sounded unsure even to her own ears.</p><p>He hesitated, but only for a moment. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Now was the time to turn away. To end any kind of relationship before it began. One thing was certain: she shouldn\u2019t have paused. But she did. \u201cI like you, Joshua.\u201d More than she should. More than she wanted to. \u201cI misled you, and I regret that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarl isn\u2019t right for you.\u201d His words were stark and cool, his gaze intense.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d she argued. \u201cYou\u2019ve never even met Carl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her eyes because meeting his gaze had become impossible. Her throat felt as if it were about to close up on her. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said, stopping her. He backed her into the shadows until her shoulders butted against the side of the brick structure. Instinctively she clenched the lapels of his overcoat. Even when she realized he intended to kiss her, she couldn\u2019t find the words to object. Being inherently honest, Hannah realized this was exactly what she\u2019d wanted for a long time.</p><p>Slowly, as though he expected her to protest, Joshua lowered his mouth to hers. She assumed his kiss would be hard and demanding, a penance required for having misled him. A penalty to be paid.</p><p>But she was wrong.</p><p>He pressed his lips gently over hers in the lightest, the tenderest, of contacts. So sweet. So smooth. The pressure increased, so gradual at first that she didn\u2019t notice. His lips worked over hers, sliding, then deepening, encouraging her to open to him.</p><p>With him as her tutor, Hannah eased open her mouth and moaned. This was nothing like the quick pecks and almost apologetic exchanges she\u2019d experienced with Carl. Nothing like anything she\u2019d experienced with anyone. Her nails dug into his coat, and she responded with a lifetime of pent-up longings.</p><p>It seemed to require a great deal of effort for Joshua to break off the kiss. Even then he seemed to ease himself away from her with a series of short but equally potent kisses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He held her against him, and she stayed, the ragged edge of his breathing echoing in her ear. Her own breathing was just as unstable. Wrapped in the warm cocoon of his arms, Hannah never wanted to leave.</p><p>\u201cPlease . . . my family is waiting. They don\u2019t know where I am.\u201d It was pointless to continue. Pointless to torture themselves.</p><p>His arms tightened before he released her. \u201cMeet me,\u201d he whispered against her cheek. \u201cMonday evening at eight at the skating rink at Rockefeller Center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. You know I can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBe there, Hannah,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cI need time to think. We both do. You don\u2019t love Carl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoshua . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t love him,\u201d he returned with conviction, \u201cotherwise you\u2019d never have allowed me to kiss you like that.\u201d With that he turned away.</p><p>Hannah wanted to run after him and explain that she wouldn\u2019t show. She had no intention of continuing this charade. That was why she\u2019d told him about Carl. It was too late for them. Much too late.</p><p>\u201cJoshua,\u201d she called.</p> <p>He ignored her, and because she was forced into it, she raced after him. She was out of breath by the time she reached him.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be there,\u201d she cried. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He turned, and for the first time since she\u2019d told him about her commitment to Carl, he smiled, saying without words that he believed otherwise.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be wasting your time,\u201d she argued heatedly.</p><p>Joshua said nothing, then wrapped his arm around her waist and dragged her to him. His kiss was short but thorough. When he finished, he exhaled slowly. \u201cYou\u2019ll be there,\u201d he said with supreme confidence. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to stay away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill Hannah meet Joshua?\u201d Shirley asked Goodness. The two had parked themselves atop a light fixture in the Morgansterns\u2019 deli. Hannah\u2019s father was locking the doors while her mother was upstairs preparing the evening meal.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Goodness was downright gleeful.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I think?\u201d Shirley repeated. \u201cI think you\u2019re headed for serious trouble with Gabriel, that\u2019s what I think.\u201d</p><p>Goodness couldn\u2019t have disagreed more. \u201cGabriel knew exactly what was going to happen,\u201d she insisted. \u201cHe might think Carl Rabinsky is the cat\u2019s meow, but you and I both know he isn\u2019t the right man for Hannah.\u201d</p><p>Shirley\u2019s look was skeptical. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that Carl\u2019s as confused about all this as Hannah. The poor boy\u2019s parents had more to do with the engagement than he did. They pushed him into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Goodness confessed reluctantly, \u201cbut I\u2019d wager a good deal that was the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re wagering,\u201d Shirley seemed to feel obliged to tell her, \u201cis our futures. You\u2019ve done this before, you know. My heaven,\u201d she continued, wringing her hands. \u201cI can\u2019t get involved in your prayer request, not when I\u2019ve got troubles of my own.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Brynn and Roberto. This is simply not the time for her to walk around with her head in the clouds. She needs her wits about her. I\u2019m afraid something serious is about to happen, and I can\u2019t be constantly fretting about what you\u2019re getting into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d If she didn\u2019t know better, Goodness would be insulted.</p><p>\u201cYes, you. I beg of you, Goodness, kindly leave matters be with Carl and Hannah.\u201d</p><p>Goodness considered it seriously, but not for long. She didn\u2019t mean to be a rabble-rouser, but there were some matters that one couldn\u2019t ignore. Unfortunately this was one of those times.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Shirley groaned, and her head slumped forward. \u201cWhy did I know you were going to say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, really I am. But I asked myself exactly why Gabriel would assign this particular prayer request to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it,\u201d Goodness said, crossing her arms. \u201cRuth Morganstern prayed that Hannah would make a good marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Shirley agreed impatiently.</p><p>\u201cIt was as clear as the feathers in our wings that Carl was about to ask for Hannah\u2019s hand in marriage. Both Hannah\u2019s parents are nuts about Carl, and his family about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>Goodness had a hard time believing that her fellow prayer ambassador could be so thickheaded. \u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Goodness said with a sorry lack of patience, \u201cGabriel assumed the assignment would be a snap. An engagement to Carl was in the cards already. Really all that was required was for me to stand back and let it happen. Once Hannah was formally engaged to Carl I was supposed to pretend it was all my doing and promptly return to heaven, the assignment complete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannah is formally engaged to Carl,\u201d Shirley reminded her.</p><p>Shirley was missing her point entirely. \u201cThat\u2019s true, but Gabriel doesn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words,\u201d Shirley said, walking circles around Goodness as she mulled over the situation, \u201cyou think this job is another one of Gabriel\u2019s little token assignments.\u201d</p><p>Goodness folded her arms and nodded with a good deal of ceremony. \u201cI do indeed, and frankly I\u2019m insulted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean like the chess set for Craig?\u201d</p><p>Goodness nodded. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>This information seemed to fluster her friend. \u201cMy oh my, I don\u2019t know what to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I do,\u201d Goodness returned with a hint of self-righteousness. \u201cIt was clear to me from the first that Carl Rabinsky isn\u2019t the right husband for Hannah. In good conscience I can\u2019t idly stand by and let her marry the wrong man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Shirley asked, and then crunched up her face as if she were afraid of the answer.</p><p>Goodness relaxed and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet, but I do know one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going to marry Carl.\u201d</p><p>Sunday morning Brynn quietly slipped inside the pew at St. Philip\u2019s, crossed herself, and knelt on the padded kneeler. She closed her eyes and bowed her head, fully intending to pray. But it wasn\u2019t thoughts of God that filled her mind. Instead she found herself mulling over the night before with the church youth group and Roberto Alcantara.</p><p>Every time Brynn remembered the dance in which they\u2019d shared the duty as chaperones, a warm, expectant feeling stole over her. It had all started innocently enough when they\u2019d first danced together. No one seemed to want to be the first couple on the floor, so Roberto, stiffly, had asked her. She knew from the way his lips tightened that he wasn\u2019t keen on being her partner. Taking it personally, she\u2019d glared back at him, letting it be known that she didn\u2019t relish his company, either.</p><p>Yet from that shaky beginning, something fragile and exciting had blossomed. As the music started, Roberto had held her awkwardly in his arms, his body rigid, as if to avoid touching her.</p><p>Then gradually, as they\u2019d warmed to the rhythm of the music, he\u2019d relaxed. Because he had, she had too. Slowly, almost without being aware of what was happening, she\u2019d found herself tucked securely in Roberto\u2019s arms. It amazed her how well they performed together, how easy his steps were to follow. Anyone looking at them would have assumed they were longtime partners. Halfway through the dance Roberto had smiled, and she\u2019d shyly returned the gesture. Then he\u2019d tucked his head close to hers, and they\u2019d continued to sway gracefully across the polished gym floor.</p><p>From that point forward in the evening, Brynn had looked for an excuse to dance with Roberto a second time. Unfortunately their duties had prevented them from spending any more time together. The teenage dance had gone on until almost midnight, and the high schoolers couldn\u2019t have kept them apart more had they plotted to do so.</p><p>From the silent messages Roberto had sent her way, from the quick exchanges of eye contact, she\u2019d realized that he was as eager to be with her as she was with him.</p><p>After the dance, Roberto had walked her to her car. At first they\u2019d been shy with each other, not knowing what to say. But gradually that had changed, and they\u2019d chatted freely. Brynn was certain Roberto had meant to ask her for a date, but before he\u2019d had a chance, a fight had broken out between two boys. In his frustration, Roberto had closed his eyes and forcefully released his breath. Brynn had felt the regret in him as he\u2019d turned away and hurried toward the scuffle.</p><p>Long after she was home, Brynn had found it impossible to sleep. Again and again her mind had reviewed the one dance she\u2019d shared with Roberto. The memory had left her hungering to learn what would have happened had they been free to enjoy one another\u2019s company.</p><p>The more she thought about Roberto, the more she admired his accomplishments. He worked hard and seemed determined to make his business a successful enterprise. He genuinely cared about his brother\u2019s welfare and took an active role in the community. Father Grady, whom Brynn considered to be an excellent judge of character, couldn\u2019t say enough good about Roberto.</p><p>True, they\u2019d started off on the wrong foot, but Brynn was eager to make up for that and start again. If she did have God\u2019s attention, then what she sought was for Roberto to be at church this morning.</p><p>Giving up the pretense of praying, Brynn opened her eyes and sat on the hard wooden pew. She didn\u2019t see Roberto and couldn\u2019t swivel around to look without being obvious.</p><p>Triumphant organ music announced the beginning of mass, which Father Grady celebrated. Not until Brynn stood to follow the others to the altar for communion did she spy Roberto. Instantly her heart gladdened.</p><p>He saw her too, because she watched as a brief smile touched his eyes.</p><p>After mass Roberto was waiting on the top of the church steps for her. Following the throng of the faithful out of the large double-wide doors, Brynn saw Roberto almost immediately and waved.</p><p>\u201cSo we meet again,\u201d she said. She hated the breathless quality to her voice, but she couldn\u2019t hide how pleased she was to see him.</p><p>He acknowledged her with a short nod.</p><p>\u201cDid the boys give you any trouble last night?\u201d she asked, wanting to learn the outcome of the fight.</p><p>He shrugged as though to say it wasn\u2019t anything serious. \u201cI separated them and had Emilio take Modesto with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>Once again Brynn noted what a fine figure of a man Roberto made. She didn\u2019t know what had blinded her earlier.</p><p>\u201cSo it was Modesto,\u201d she murmured. That didn\u2019t surprise her.</p><p>\u201cMike and Modesto were going at it until\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d Brynn interrupted. \u201cNot Mike Glasser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the name.\u201d</p><p>Brynn hadn\u2019t seen the morose young man all evening. But then it would be characteristic of Mike to conceal himself in the shadows. If he had come to the dance, then perhaps some girl had caught his eye. Brynn hoped that was the case. She genuinely liked Mike and wished she knew how to reach him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt surprises me that Mike would fight anyone, especially Modesto.\u201d Although she said the words aloud, she didn\u2019t expect Roberto to comment. Mike wasn\u2019t a fighter. Modesto was much more savvy when it came to such matters. The Hispanic youth would have dropped Mike in record time.</p><p>\u201cWhatever plagued him was a hot issue,\u201d Roberto commented. \u201cFrom what the others told me, Mike went after Modesto without provocation. The funny thing is, I don\u2019t think Modesto really wanted to fight him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were able to break it up before anyone was hurt?\u201d she asked, unable to hide her concern.</p><p>Roberto nodded, and a hint of a smile turned up the edges of his mouth. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p> <p>Brynn relaxed.</p><p>Roberto was about to say something when Emilio strolled past casually and stopped as though surprised to find his older brother spending time with his teacher. \u201cMornin\u2019, Miss Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning, Emilio.\u201d</p><p>The teenager turned to his brother. \u201cHave you asked her yet?\u201d</p><p>Roberto answered in Spanish, his voice low and threatening.</p> <p>Emilio ignored him. \u201cHe\u2019s going to invite you over to the apartment for breakfast. I\u2019m supposed to make myself scarce.\u201d He grinned boyishly and added in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019d be careful if I were you, \u2019cause it looks to me like my big brother intends to put the make on you.\u201d</p><p>Brynn couldn\u2019t keep from laughing, but Roberto wasn\u2019t amused. He spoke again, and his tone was clear. He wanted his brother to shut up and leave them alone.</p><p>If Emilio felt the least bit threatened by his brother, he didn\u2019t let it show. If anything, the younger Alcantara couldn\u2019t have looked more pleased.</p><p>\u201cYou should have seen Roberto this morning,\u201d he continued undaunted. His smile was full and cocky. \u201cHe was up at the crack of dawn, shaving and splashing on that fancy cologne he likes so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmilio.\u201d Again Roberto threatened him.</p><p>\u201cHe likes you, Teach, big time.\u201d</p> <p>Brynn knew smiling was probably the worst thing she could do, but she couldn\u2019t make herself stop. Emilio was telling her everything she wanted to hear.</p><p>Disgruntled, Roberto pulled his wallet from his hip pocket and jerked out a twenty-dollar bill. \u201cGet lost for a couple of hours,\u201d he instructed.</p><p>A wide grin split Emilio\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m outta here.\u201d He looked to Brynn and winked. \u201cHave fun, you two.\u201d With that he was gone.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for my brother,\u201d Roberto said flatly.</p><p>Brynn arched one brow. \u201cWas what Emilio said true? Do you intend to put the make on me?\u201d</p><p>His intensely dark eyes didn\u2019t waver from hers. \u201cThat depends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral matters,\u201d he said, and cleared his throat. \u201cMostly on if you feel the same way about me as I do you.\u201d He reached for her hand and laced his fingers with hers. \u201cI\u2019d be honored if you\u2019d join me for breakfast.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re volunteering to cook?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I accept.\u201d</p><p>Hand in hand they strolled down the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cWe have nothing in common.\u201d It was as though he felt obligated to remind her of that.</p><p>\u201cI certainly don\u2019t agree with your views on education,\u201d she added. If he was looking for reasons they shouldn\u2019t see each other, she had a list of her own.</p><p>Roberto\u2019s chest deflated as he released a pent-up breath. \u201cYou\u2019re Irish, I\u2019m Hispanic. I have no business bringing you home with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, as though admitting to a fault.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Perhaps she should leave matters as they are and not ask.</p><p>\u201cBecause I had to know.\u201d His voice was gruff with impatience, but Brynn understood. She was equally curious. Equally fascinated with him.</p><p>\u201cI needed to know, too,\u201d she admitted softly.</p><p>Roberto\u2019s hand squeezed hers, and when she looked up, he smiled.</p><p>He brought her to the apartment he shared with his brother. The compact unit was decorated with large overstuffed pieces of furniture. The royal blue material had several crocheted doilies flattened across the back.</p><p>\u201cMy mother made those,\u201d Roberto explained when Brynn ran her finger over the delicately crafted cotton threads.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>Before Brynn could comment, Roberto turned her in his arms. She came willingly, without a qualm, eager for his kiss. He didn\u2019t disappoint her. Soon his mouth settled firmly over hers. His kiss was both hot and compelling. Brynn\u2019s breath caught in her throat as he wrappped her securely in his arms. She buried her face in the hollow of his neck and breathed in the warm, spicy rum scent of him. The bay cologne reminded her of what Emilio had said, and she smiled softly and pressed her lips against his smoothly shaven skin.</p><p>\u201cI meant to wait to kiss you,\u201d he confessed, his lips in her hair. \u201cAt least until after breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to wait.\u201d</p><p>He continued to caress her back. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she agreed, and stepped up onto the tips of her toes to kiss him again. The world dissolved, melting away any resistance that might have remained. \u201cWe\u2019re both crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe world is crazy,\u201d Roberto agreed, \u201cbut I haven\u2019t the strength to resist you.\u201d</p><p>Brynn closed her eyes and pressed her head against the solid strength of his shoulder. She was content to stay as they were, but she wasn\u2019t blind to their differences. What Roberto said was true. They had little in common other than the fact that they were crazy about each other.</p><p>Jenny was convinced she was coming down with a cold. Her throat ached, and she alternated between hot flashes and the chills. And she swore every bone in her body ached. A cold complicated by the flu.</p><p>She managed to sing her way through the two production numbers she was involved in from South Pacific. She smiled as if she hadn\u2019t a care in the world, delivered the dinners to her customers, and counted the minutes until she\u2019d finished her shift.</p><p>When she returned to the apartment the first thing she did was take a long, hot shower. Even with the comfort of warm water raining down on her, she developed a hacking cough.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound so good,\u201d Michelle called from the other side of the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m miserable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to get you some aspirin?\u201d her roommate offered.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d Jenny said as she opened the door. \u201cI took some when I got home.\u201d Dressed in a thick terry-cloth robe, she ambled into the living room and buried herself under the wool afghan her mother had mailed her last Christmas.</p><p>\u201cI bet a nice hot bowl of chicken soup would help you to feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Nurse Michelle,\u201d Jenny teased.</p><p>\u201cYou need something,\u201d her roommate insisted.</p><p>What she needed, Jenny realized, wasn\u2019t to be easily found. More than at any other time since her arrival in New York, Jenny needed her family.</p><p>Jenny could feel a sneeze coming on, and she reached for a tissue and nearly blew a hole through it with the force of her misery.</p><p>\u201cMy goodness.\u201d Michelle laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Christmas party?\u201d Jenny asked, wanting to take her mind off her woes. She needed to divert Michelle before she whipped out a thermometer and dispensed massive doses of TLC. Struggling as she was against bouts of self-pity, Jenny preferred to suffer alone.</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness, the party! I nearly forgot.\u201d Michelle walked over to her purse and took out a list. \u201cI talked to Paul. You remember Paul Fredricks, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Jenny nodded, although she hadn\u2019t a clue who Paul was. She\u2019d figure it out in a moment.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Paul says the fifth would work out great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fifth is fine with me.\u201d For the life of her, Jenny couldn\u2019t figure out why they would need to clear the date with Paul Fredricks, but again that was something she would leave to reason out later.</p><p>\u201cDo you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d One day was as good as any other as far as she was concerned. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure I have the fifth off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I added Paul\u2019s name to the list while I was at it. You don\u2019t object, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he can come. The more the merrier.\u201d Paul Fredricks, of course. He was the actor who\u2019d captured Michelle\u2019s attention and her heart after one short meeting. Her roommate seemed to think no one had noticed. Perhaps no one else had, but Jenny wasn\u2019t as easily fooled.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Michelle said, standing inside the kitchen. \u201cThe message machine is blinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot to check,\u201d Jenny admitted. The first order of business when she\u2019d returned home was aspirin and a hot shower. \u201cWho called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Michelle pushed down the button and reached for a pad and pen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Irene,\u201d Michelle cried.</p><p>It would be just like their agent to leave the most important news of their careers on the answering machine.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where you girls are,\u201d Irene\u2019s elevated voice said, \u201cbut I sincerely hope you\u2019ll be home soon. Now listen up! I talked to John Peterman this afternoon, and he wants you both back for a second audition first thing in the morning. I repeat, he wants to see you both again.\u201d</p><p>Michelle looked to Jenny.</p><p>Jenny looked to Michelle.</p><p>Michelle threw open her arms and screamed.</p><p>Her cold forgotten, Jenny tossed aside the quilt and raced over to her friend\u2019s open arms. Together they danced around the living room, screaming at the top of their lungs.</p><p>Then Jenny started to cough again.</p><p>Eight</p><p>\u201cSuzie, can I see you after class?\u201d Brynn asked the Chinese girl. Of all her students, Brynn found real encouragement in watching this particular teenager\u2019s progress. Suzie\u2019s written essays revealed a quick, analytical mind and a thirst for knowledge. Brynn hadn\u2019t said anything to Suzie, but she\u2019d taken it upon herself to inquire about the possibility of a full-ride scholarship for the girl.</p><p>Suzie glanced up from her desk and blinked. \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Brynn quickly assured her. She patted Suzie\u2019s shoulder, and the girl returned to her writing assignment.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to see me, too?\u201d Malcolm called from the back of the classroom, disrupting the calm. That was Malcolm\u2019s specialty.</p><p>\u201cNot today,\u201d she said.</p><p>Malcolm folded his muscular arms and leaned back on his desk chair until his shoulders were braced against the wall. His eyes were round with irritation. \u201cI heard you stopped by my place yesterday and asked to speak to my mother. If you got something to say to her, you can say it to me first.\u201d He lifted his chin an inch in open defiance.</p><p>It was clear Malcolm didn\u2019t trust her. Brynn doubted that many of her students did, although she\u2019d worked hard to gain their confidence. Again and again she butted her head against the thick walls of doubt and suspicion. To the best of her knowledge she hadn\u2019t gone against her word once, yet her students acted as if they were waiting for her to knife them in the back. Certainly the incident with Emilio that first day hadn\u2019t helped matters any. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy stepdad said you stopped by my place, too.\u201d This was from Yolanda.</p><p>\u201cAre you looking to make trouble for us?\u201d It was Malcolm again.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you want with my mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You ain\u2019t got no right to talk about me behind my back.\u201d</p> <p>Brynn could see that she\u2019d best explain the purpose of those after-school visits. She\u2019d hoped meeting her students\u2019 families would be a positive experience; instead she\u2019d incurred the mistrust and ire of her class.</p><p>Emilio sat up and looked over his shoulder. \u201cMiss Cassidy comes to my apartment most every afternoon, and I ain\u2019t making no fuss about it.\u201d</p><p>His remark was followed by several boos and hisses. Emilio just smiled. He reveled in the fact that Brynn had been seeing a good deal of Roberto. What he said, however, wasn\u2019t true.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d Brynn said, holding up her hands. \u201cIt looks like I owe you an explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right you do.\u201d</p> <p>Brynn looked into a sea of angry faces. \u201cMalcolm, you\u2019re right. I did stop off at your place yesterday afternoon. I wanted to tell your mother it was a pleasure to have you in my class and report to her that your progress in the last few weeks has been nothing short of amazing.\u201d</p><p>Malcolm\u2019s mouth snapped closed. He looked confused, then relieved. \u201cYou wanted to tell her good things about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you came to my house?\u201d Yolanda asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019d hoped to visit everyone\u2019s family by the end of the quarter. Yolanda, I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with how well you\u2019re doing. You\u2019ve maintained a B average, and I wanted your family to know how hard you\u2019ve been working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to say that about me.\u201d</p><p>Denzil was right about that. His grades had been dismal, and he gave little if any thought or effort to his assignments. His contributions to the class were limited to disruptions and arguments.</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, thinking on her feet. \u201cI thought I\u2019d tell your parents how I\u2019ve noticed your ability to argue an issue from any point. That\u2019s the quality of a good attorney. If you were the least bit interested, you could make a career learning the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn attorney?\u201d Denzil sat up straighter on his chair. \u201cMe, an attorney?\u201d He laughed under his breath. \u201cI\u2019ve had lots of experience with the law, and I\u2019ve met some of those fast-talkin\u2019 lawyers, too. Only they were looking to toss my butt in jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are other kinds of attorneys,\u201d Brynn told him.</p><p>\u201cI could wear one of those fancy silk suits, couldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Listen, Denzil,\u201d she said, her convictions causing her voice to grow strong and sure, \u201cthis is exactly what I\u2019ve been telling you all quarter. You can be anything you want. The power is right here inside you.\u201d She held her clenched fist against her breast. \u201cAll you\u2019ve got to do is want it bad enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t never had anyone tell my mother good things about me,\u201d Yolanda said. \u201cThe only time a teacher ever came to my house was because she thought I took something out of her stinking purse.\u201d Looking away, she sighed loudly. \u201cI did it, too, because that teacher was a real jerk. She wasn\u2019t even fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got any good things to tell Roberto about me?\u201d Emilio asked, and draped his elbows over the back of his seat. He was sitting proud.</p><p>\u201cI have plenty to tell Roberto about you,\u201d Brynn teased as she rubbed the chalk dust from the palms of her hands.</p> <p>The class laughed, just as Brynn intended they should.</p><p>\u201cNow that I\u2019ve answered your questions, please return to your writing assignment.\u201d Generally, when she directed her students\u2019 attention back to a written task, a grumble of discontent would spread across the room. Not this time.</p><p>After the bell rang, dismissing the class, Suzie Chang made her way to Brynn\u2019s desk. The shy girl clenched her books tightly. \u201cYou wanted to talk to me, Miss Cassidy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Brynn said, scooting the chair back. \u201cSuzie, you\u2019re an excellent student. This last paper you wrote about Anne Frank is as good as anything I\u2019ve read on the subject. You revealed both insight and sensitivity to the Jewish girl\u2019s plight.\u201d</p><p>Uncomfortable with the praise, the teenager lowered her gaze. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to know if you plan on attending college next year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollege.\u201d The girl\u2019s eyes lit up briefly, then she sobered and slowly shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Suzie, you\u2019re exactly the kind of student who should continue their education. I can feel the hunger in you, the desire to learn. There\u2019s a way, I promise you. I can help you if you want.\u201d</p><p>The girl shifted her weight from one foot to the other. She kept her head lowered and refused to meet Brynn\u2019s eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t, Miss Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuzie, didn\u2019t you hear what I said to Denzil earlier? Where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way. Now if you\u2019re worried about the money, there are scholarships. I\u2019ll help you fill out the applications, and . . .\u201d</p><p>Suzie\u2019s head snapped up, and Brynn noticed that the teenager\u2019s face was streaked with tears. \u201cA scholarship isn\u2019t going to help me, Miss Cassidy. Nothing will.\u201d Having said that, Suzie turned and raced out of the classroom.</p><p>Stunned, Brynn sat at her desk for several moments, pondering Suzie\u2019s words. Nothing would help her? That made no sense.</p><p>Feeling as though she\u2019d somehow failed her brightest student, Brynn left the building, determined to try again to meet Denzil\u2019s and Malcolm\u2019s parents. Perhaps she\u2019d have more success now that the word was out that she wanted to compliment the teens instead of complain.</p><p>A block away from the school the streets were dirty, filled with litter and broken glass. A discarded davenport was turned upside down and garbage dumped in the ripped undercarriage. The smells of rotting food were potent enough to cause Brynn to turn her head away.</p><p>Dusk settled over the city. The streetlights that weren\u2019t broken blinked on, casting a clouded yellow glow to the filth on the sidewalk.</p><p>From the distance, Brynn watched as a man approached her. She stiffened, then reminded herself she had nothing to fear. This was a violent neighborhood, but like Father Grady, Brynn had faith in the goodwill of those who occupied the tenements.</p><p>As the figure of the man grew near, Brynn recognized Roberto. When he realized it was she, his steps became quick and filled with purpose. The tension drained from her, and Brynn relaxed. They\u2019d met twice in the last week, swift snatches of time they\u2019d stolen in an effort to be together. Five minutes. Ten. Just long enough to convey that they wished it could be longer.</p><p>\u201cRoberto.\u201d She didn\u2019t bother to disguise her happiness.</p><p>Roberto was frowning. \u201cIt\u2019s true, then,\u201d he said, sounding none too pleased.</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d she asked, surprised by his attitude.</p><p>\u201cEmilio stopped off at the garage to tell me you were parading around these streets after school visiting families.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you realize it\u2019s dark now by four-thirty?\u201d he barked. He jerked off his baseball cap and slapped it against his knee in a display of disgust.</p><p>\u201cRoberto, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy, woman?\u201d He said something in Spanish, and from his tone, it was just as well she didn\u2019t understand. \u201cYou\u2019re inviting trouble. I thought you had more sense than this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoberto, if you\u2019d only listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo what? Don\u2019t you realize this is New York City? You\u2019re targeting yourself to be the next crime victim. You\u2019re inviting trouble. I can\u2019t follow you around and protect you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t appreciate his attitude, but she didn\u2019t want to argue, not when they\u2019d come so far. She stiffened her shoulders and glared right back at him. The cold wind whipped about her face as she struggled with her composure. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t got a clue,\u201d Roberto snapped. \u201cWhat could possibly be so important for you to risk your life?\u201d</p><p>She tried to tell herself that he was so angry because he cared, but his attitude stung. The people in this neighborhood knew her. She couldn\u2019t go more than a few houses before she met someone she recognized from either the school or the church.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand?\u201d Roberto said, gripping her by the shoulders. \u201cYou can\u2019t change the world on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can help these kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrynn, oh, my darling fool.\u201d Briefly he closed his eyes, struggling to hold on to his temper. \u201cYou can do nothing. You can change nothing. Denzil, Malcolm, and all the rest will live and die in this neighborhood the same way Emilio and I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d she argued. She could make a difference. She believed that with all her heart. That was the reason she was here.</p><p>\u201cGrow up,\u201d he said, his fingers biting deep into her coat. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to step out of this dream world you\u2019re living in. Look around you. Can\u2019t you see?\u201d</p><p>Brynn refused to believe what he said. \u201cWe have a difference of opinion, Roberto, but that\u2019s no reason to treat me like a child.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to be struggling within himself. After a moment, he dropped his hands and his features hardened. \u201cGo home, Brynn. For the love of God, go home where you belong. You don\u2019t fit in here. Just go!\u201d he shouted, and gave her a light push.</p><p>She blanched. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been more serious in my life. Pack your bags and head back to Rhode Island or wherever it was you came from before you get yourself killed. Please, Brynn.\u201d This last part came on a rush of emotion.</p><p>The pain his words produced sucked the breath from her lungs. At first she could barely think, and when she spoke her voice betrayed her pain. \u201cYou want me to leave?\u201d</p><p>He held himself stiffly away from her and didn\u2019t answer for several moments. Then something broke within him, and he expelled his breath forcefully. Before her heart beat again, before she could take another breath, Roberto brought her into his arms. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want you to go.\u201d</p><p>Her arms circled his waist, and he relaxed. Nothing had ever felt more right than to be in Roberto\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cPromise me, if you\u2019re so anxious to go out nights, you\u2019ll let either me or Emilio accompany you.\u201d</p><p>She remembered his words about not having the time to be her bodyguard and knew he\u2019d said those hurtful things only because he was worried for her.</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She nodded, and he kissed the top of her head.</p><p>Beneath the warm, golden glow of the streetlight, the man who\u2019d shouted at her only moments earlier now bent his head to kiss her. \u201cWhat am I going to do with you?\u201d he said.</p><p>Brynn smiled to herself, content in his arms. In time he\u2019d realize she could make a difference. If it was only to be in one life, then so be it, but she wouldn\u2019t walk away from her students, nor would she leave this neighborhood, no matter what Roberto thought. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jenny stood on stage, dressed in her tights and dancing shoes. Five others stood with her, including Michelle. All triple threats. Each one accomplished in singing, dancing, and acting. Each one eager to be John Peterman\u2019s latest Broadway discovery. Each one pleading silently to be chosen for this role. Any role. A chance.</p><p>Bright lights blinded her, but Jenny was accustomed to not being able to view her audience. Her throat was raw and her head throbbed, but she ignored the cold and flu symptoms as best she could.</p><p>\u201cMiss Lancaster.\u201d</p><p>The man with the booming voice called her name. Jenny stepped forward and shaded her eyes with her hand. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sang \u2018Don\u2019t Cry for Me, Argentina\u2019 in the first audition, is that correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her voice quivered with the strain of answering his questions.</p><p>\u201cDid you bring your sheet music with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She looked to the man sitting at the piano.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you be singing this time?\u201d</p> <p>With her cold and her throat feeling the way it did, Jenny knew her voice wouldn\u2019t carry any musical number with more than a two-octave range. Normally her voice was able to scale four octaves, something that had amazed and thrilled her music teachers in Custer, Montana. But such versatility wasn\u2019t uncommon here in New York.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be singing \u2018Rainy Days and Mondays,\u2019 \u201c Jenny told the faceless voice. The first piano notes broke into the silence. She was forced to clear her throat, which had tightened up on her to where she could barely speak, let alone sing.</p><p>The piano player looked at her when she didn\u2019t come in on cue and played the introduction a second time. She opened her mouth and nothing came out. She tried again, and what sound did escape wasn\u2019t anywhere close to being considered musical.</p><p>Miserable, Jenny raised her hand and stopped the piano player. There was no use continuing. Not now. She couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she mumbled, wavered, and reached out blindly, afraid she was about to collapse.</p><p>Michelle gripped her hand. \u201cJenny\u2019s sick . . . she shouldn\u2019t even be here.\u201d</p> <p>Her roommate placed her arm around Jenny\u2019s shoulders, and she slumped against Michelle, needing her friend\u2019s support to remain upright.</p><p>\u201cShe has a fever of a hundred and two,\u201d Michelle informed the casting director.</p><p>\u201cAnd you are?\u201d the loud voice boomed.</p><p>Michelle stiffened. \u201cHer roommate. I realize this is none of my business, but I\u2019m afraid Jenny\u2019s sick. If you want to hear her sing, our agent can supply you with any number of tapes. Come on, Jenny,\u201d Michelle said, steering her off the stage. \u201cI\u2019m taking you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jenny protested. It was bad enough that her best chance of ever appearing on Broadway was being taken away, but she wouldn\u2019t allow her own misfortune to ruin Michelle\u2019s chances, too. \u201cYou stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI insist. Don\u2019t argue with me. This is your chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Jenny\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMichelle Jordan!\u201d the voice shouted.</p><p>Michelle wavered and looked over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAre you staying or going?\u201d the voice asked.</p><p>\u201cStaying,\u201d Jenny answered for her. She\u2019d meant to shout. She\u2019d put all her effort into making herself heard, but what remained of her voice was shockingly weak.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jenny, are you sure you\u2019ll be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. All I need is a little rest.\u201d She managed to put on a bright smile, which depleted what little energy remained. \u201cI\u2019ll get a taxi,\u201d she promised a second time. A real luxury, considering her finances.</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Now break a leg, kid,\u201d she said in her best Humphrey Bogart imitation. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to make it for both of us.\u201d She felt like weeping but managed to keep the tears at bay until she was outside the theater.</p><p>It was snowing. Wouldn\u2019t you know it? Every man, woman, and child in New York would be looking for a cab. Jenny stepped halfway out into the street and raised her arm in an effort to hail a taxi. The cold snow was a welcome coolant as it drifted onto her upturned face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to help her, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Goodness asked Mercy. \u201cThat poor girl\u2019s sick and miserable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m going to help her.\u201d Mercy was indignant that her friend would believe otherwise. \u201cIt\u2019s just that this is the worst time imaginable for her to find an empty taxi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, do something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you suggest?\u201d Mercy snapped, impatient herself.</p><p>\u201cStop traffic.\u201d</p><p>Mercy grinned. Why hadn\u2019t she thought of that herself? It wouldn\u2019t be so difficult to create a distraction. Not with Goodness there to help her. Naturally it would work; she just hoped Gabriel didn\u2019t find out about this.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she said, sharing a gleeful smile with her friend.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTimes Square,\u201d Mercy answered.</p><p>\u201cYes, but . . .\u201d</p><p>Even Goodness looked surprised, and Mercy grinned sheepishly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Gabriel will never hear of it.\u201d Well, at least she hoped that was the case.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d Someone near Jenny stretched out an arm and pointed toward the huge electronic billboard above Times Square. \u201cWhat in heaven\u2019s name is going on?\u201d</p><p>Jenny looked up and did a double take. The sign that had flashed a huge Santa drinking a bottle of Coca-Cola only minutes earlier had disappeared. In its stead stood a picture of her own face, with the words flashing \u201cJenny needs a cab. Help Jenny.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, certain she was seeing things. Her fever must be higher than she realized for her to hallucinate this way. Obviously she\u2019d stepped over the edge of reality.</p><p>Cars slowed to a crawl. Any number of people paused and pointed to the sign.</p><p>\u201cAre you Jenny?\u201d a bag lady who was nearly bent in half asked her. She wore a ragged wool coat. A worn shopping bag was draped over her forearm.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jenny whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to help you,\u201d the old woman proclaimed. \u201cI\u2019ll get you that cab, now don\u2019t you worry none.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sick,\u201d Jenny whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, dear, now don\u2019t you fret. You\u2019ll be home soon enough.\u201d Holding Jenny by the arm, the old woman marched her out into the middle of midtown traffic and stood in front of the first yellow cab she spied.</p><p>The cabdriver stuck his head out the window and shouted angrily. Apparently he hadn\u2019t been in the country long, because his accent was so thick that it was nearly impossible to understand him.</p><p>\u201cThis is Jenny.\u201d The bag lady opened the cab door and stuck her head inside. \u201cShe\u2019s sick and needs to get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if she\u2019s the president,\u201d the man inside the cab muttered, clenching his briefcase as if he expected the woman to snatch it from him. \u201cI\u2019m not giving up this cab. Driver,\u201d he instructed, \u201cdo something.\u201d</p><p>The driver twisted around and placed his hands over his ears. \u201cOnly been in America one day.\u201d</p><p>The passenger said something under his breath.</p><p>Undeterred, the bag lady tried a second time. \u201cThat sign up there says this woman needs help. Now get out.\u201d</p><p>The dignified-looking businessman bristled. \u201cWhat sign?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at the billboard!\u201d she shouted. \u201cNow do as I say.\u201d</p><p>Jenny remained in a daze, barely able to decipher what was happening around her. Horns blared. People stopped and stared. Traffic snarled even worse than it normally did. No one moved.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Jenny?\u201d the businessman leaned halfway out of the cab to ask her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh, all right,\u201d he muttered, and with that he hopped out of the cab.</p><p>Jenny turned to thank the bag lady who\u2019d helped her, but she\u2019d disappeared into the crowd. Safe and warm, Jenny climbed inside the cab, laid back her head, and closed her eyes. The next thing she knew the driver pulled up in front of her apartment complex. She couldn\u2019t remember giving him her address.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know where I lived?\u201d she asked as she pulled out her limited cash reserve to pay him.</p><p>\u201cThe old lady told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d Jenny shook her head, hoping to clear her thoughts. She\u2019d never seen that woman before in her life. How could the bag lady have known where she lived?</p><p>\u201cGood job,\u201d Goodness said, standing under the blinking lights of Times Square.</p><p>Mercy was downright proud of herself. She\u2019d pulled off the role of the bag lady with the finesse that had done all angels proud. \u201cJenny never even guessed she was dealing with an angel,\u201d she bragged to her friend.</p><p>\u201cI see you had a bit of a problem with that businessman, though. He didn\u2019t seem willing to give up his seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nonbeliever,\u201d Mercy explained. \u201cHe prefers to take care of matters himself. Poor fellow. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks to me like he\u2019s missing his cab.\u201d Goodness chuckled and pointed to the street below. The man stood with his shoulders hunched against the cold, his arm raised in a desperate effort to hail a taxi.</p><p>Joshua was about to give up hope that Hannah would show. He\u2019d waited a half hour and was tempted to admit he\u2019d been wrong. His face stung with cold and his fingers were numb. He might have left if it hadn\u2019t been for the skaters gliding over the ice and all the bright lights on the fifty-foot-tall Christmas tree. Both held his attention and kept him from dwelling on his disappointment.</p><p>This was the first day of Hanukkah, the Jewish holiday that observed the freedom of religion. These few days in December celebrated the hope for peace. This night Jewish families around the world lit the first candle of the menorah, commemorating the Jewish recapture of the Temple in Jerusalem from the Hellenic Syrians in 164 b.c. It was the holiday honoring \u201cthe miracle of the oil.\u201d</p><p>If Joshua remembered his history correctly, only one small jar of undefiled oil could be found for the Temple\u2019s menorah. It should have been enough for only one day, but the jar lasted eight days, until a fresh supply could be delivered.</p><p>Joshua had never considered himself a particularly religious man. He preferred to think of himself as a man of faith. In the darkness of winter, his people celebrated the return of light.</p><p>That was the way Joshua thought of Hannah. She was a ray of sunshine in a world that had been filled with dark ambition. A ray of hope. He hated placing Hannah in the awkward position of having to choose between him and Carl, but he was confident she didn\u2019t love the other man. He would have staked his career on that.</p><p>This evening would be telling. What he\u2019d said to Hannah earlier about her not being able to stay away was true. If she truly cared for him the way he suspected, she\u2019d find a means of meeting him.</p><p>Rockefeller Center was big, but somehow, some way, they\u2019d connect. Joshua checked his watch one last time: 8:40.</p><p>His disappointment was keen. He\u2019d wanted her to come. Willed her there. But it was apparent now that he\u2019d been wrong. He had no option but to release her; she\u2019d made her choice. He\u2019d found her too late. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d turned away from the ice-skating rink when out of the blue he saw her. In that moment, it was as though the weight of the world lifted from his shoulders and his heart sang.</p><p>Hannah saw him, too, but her beautiful blue eyes were devoid of emotion. She hurried toward him, and he held out his hands to greet her.</p><p>By the time she\u2019d gripped his fingers with her own, she was breathless and barely able to talk. Her eyes were bright with questions. With doubts and confusion. Without speaking, she told him everything he needed to know. She hadn\u2019t wanted to come. Had decided to stay away . . . and found she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d she said with a sadness that was nearly his undoing. \u201cI had to come. A hundred times I told myself the best thing for both of us was if I stayed away. What have you done to me, Joshua? What have you done?\u201d</p> <p>It was difficult not to pull her into his arms and comfort her. It was what he wanted. His heart was full, spilling over. The fact that his love brought her unhappiness wasn\u2019t lost on him. In time he\u2019d make up for the unpleasantness he\u2019d caused her. If only she would be patient, he\u2019d prove to her she\u2019d made the right decision.</p><p>\u201cI think we should talk this out,\u201d she suggested. She seemed to harbor the hope that they could sit across from each other and reason away their mutual attraction. It wasn\u2019t as simple as that, but she\u2019d need to reach that realization herself.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d He sought nothing more than to be with her. It wouldn\u2019t have mattered what they did. In many ways, he felt he was already fully acquainted with Hannah. He knew he loved her. He knew he wanted her to be his wife and the mother of his children.</p><p>How or when he\u2019d come to realize all this, he couldn\u2019t answer. He was a man who dealt with facts, who argued cases. A man who generally was uncomfortable defining feelings. But when it came to Hannah Morganstern, Joshua found he was an expert on identifying his emotions.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, tucking her hand in the crook of his arm. \u201cI\u2019ll buy us a cup of hot chocolate.\u201d</p> <p>A fragile, tentative smile touched her mouth. Her beautiful, kissable mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to think we\u2019re both a little nuts,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree with you more, but it\u2019s a good kind of crazy. Being with you makes me happy, Hannah. You\u2019re beautiful and generous and loving.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her head, uneasy with compliments.</p><p>Joshua found a table, and after she was seated, he walked over to the refreshment booth and bought two steaming cups of hot chocolate.</p><p>When he returned, she glanced up at him shyly. \u201cThe most amazing thing happened this evening.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh?\u201d He sipped from the edge of the paper cup, the steam wafting upward.</p><p>\u201cWhen I told you I couldn\u2019t meet you, it wasn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t want to. Carl had asked me to attend the candle-lighting ceremony with him. It\u2019s the first day of Hanukkah,\u201d she told him unnecessarily.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew there wasn\u2019t any way I could possibly break our date. Then at the last minute Carl phoned. He came down with the flu.\u201d</p><p>That explained why Hannah was late. She\u2019d been at the synagogue with her family and then rushed from there to Rockefeller Center.</p><p>\u201cWhen I left in such a hurry, I\u2019m sure my parents thought I was going to see Carl . . . instead I\u2019m meeting another man.\u201d Sadness coated her words. It was clear she hated deceiving those she loved.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that given time, your family will learn to like me as much as they do Carl,\u201d he assured her gently. He regretted bringing the other man into the conversation. It seemed they spent half their precious time together discussing the rabbi\u2019s son.</p><p>Hannah\u2019s gaze drifted to the ice skaters and then back to him. \u201cI hardly know you myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAsk me anything you like,\u201d he invited her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve been waiting for you, Hannah Morganstern.\u201d By the way the color drained from her face, Joshua realized he\u2019d said the wrong thing. He didn\u2019t mean to rush Hannah. Because he was confident didn\u2019t mean he had to get cocky.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m engaged to Carl,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that matter to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt matters a great deal.\u201d He wasn\u2019t going to lie. When she\u2019d told him, he\u2019d been both frustrated and angry. Later he\u2019d realized just how fortunate it was that they\u2019d met before the wedding. \u201cI figure I found you just in time.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t ask her if she felt the same way. Didn\u2019t bombard her with questions. That wasn\u2019t necessary. He already knew. She felt everything he did, only for her, it wasn\u2019t so simple. Tied up with her feelings for him was a lifetime of adhering to her parents\u2019 wishes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to your family,\u201d Joshua offered, \u201cand explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain what?\u201d she asked miserably. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to tell them, Joshua. I haven\u2019t changed my mind about anything.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>Hannah had no intention of staying with Joshua. Her only purpose in meeting him was to explain once and for all that a relationship between them was impossible. It was too late for them. She was engaged to Carl now, and they\u2019d soon be planning their wedding.</p><p>That had been the reason she\u2019d decided to meet Joshua: so he\u2019d know. Yet the moment she\u2019d found him, her heart had been filled with a yearning, a wonder, that she couldn\u2019t reason away.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t look at him, she feared, and not reveal what was in her heart, so she focused her attention on the ice skaters. As a child she\u2019d loved it when her mother had taken her to this very rink. Although she\u2019d struggled to remain upright, Hannah had enjoyed the simple pleasure of gliding freely over the ice. When she\u2019d tired, she\u2019d sat and watched others, admiring the skillful athletes as they\u2019d leapt and spun their way across the rink. In her child\u2019s mind, she\u2019d dreamed about someday being as graceful and talented.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d Joshua said, and reached for her hand. He\u2019d been silent since she\u2019d announced that she fully intended to marry Carl. Hannah hoped he would accept her decision graciously and let matters drop between them. It was as difficult for him as it was for her, but she couldn\u2019t tell him that. She willed him to leave because she hadn\u2019t the strength to do it herself.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>His eyes revealed nothing, then he smiled in that gentle way of his. \u201cIce skating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Joshua, it\u2019s been years. I\u2019m not sure I even remember how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been years for me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she insisted. \u201cReally. I should get back before Mama asks questions. I can\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>Joshua stiffened. Surely he understood that she\u2019d intended never to see him again. Surely he realized that she\u2019d come this evening only because Carl had canceled at the last moment. Even now that surprised her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to lie,\u201d Joshua explained, his hand clasping hers firmly. \u201cAll I want is for you to skate with me.\u201d</p><p>Hannah gazed longingly toward the ice. She was tempted. Oh, heaven, she was tempted. It wasn\u2019t so much to ask, she decided, not when she wanted this so badly herself.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut for only a short time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>Joshua left her briefly, after checking her shoe size, and returned a few moments later with two pairs of ice skates. After lacing up his own, he knelt in front of her to be sure her skates were tied properly.</p><p>\u201cYou may well regret this,\u201d she said, linking her arm through his. Her legs wobbled when they stepped onto the ice, but Joshua\u2019s grip about her waist was firm.</p><p>Her first few steps were tentative and awkward. If not for Joshua, she was sure she would have fallen. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I let you talk me into doing this,\u201d she said, concentrating on staying on her feet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing just fine.\u201d</p><p>He was being kind, and she said so. Their first whirl around the rink was marked with her clumsy attempts to remain upright. Even with Joshua holding on to her, Hannah\u2019s arms flailed out in front of her a number of times in an effort to maintain her balance.</p><p>Before long she found a certain rhythm and glided over the smooth surface. Gaining confidence, she relaxed her grip on Joshua\u2019s arm, and he gradually released her. Skating backward in front of her, he smiled and praised her skill.</p><p>\u201cDo you think anyone from the Ice Capades is watching?\u201d she joked.</p><p>Joshua chuckled.</p><p>Thinking herself clever, Hannah decided to speed past Joshua. Unfortunately, in her effort to impress him, she lost her footing. Her feet slipped out from under her so quickly that she didn\u2019t have time to react. Arms flailing, she landed butt first on the hard, cold ice.</p><p>Joshua nearly fell on top of her, trying to keep her from losing her balance. By some minor miracle he managed to remain on his feet. Smiling broadly, he skated wide circles around her.</p><p>\u201cYou think this is funny, do you?\u201d she asked, her dignity sadly bruised.</p><p>\u201cHilarious.\u201d</p><p>Hannah\u2019s rear end was getting wet and cold from the ice. She stretched out her arm, silently seeking his assistance. Joshua ignored her hand. Bracing his fists against his hips, his skates perpendicular to each other, he circled her.</p><p>\u201cJoshua,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>Chuckling, he helped her to her feet.</p><p>They skated for more than an hour, and then afterward, because she was unbelievably hungry, they ate huge hot dogs. Mustard dripped onto Hannah\u2019s forearm, and Joshua dabbed it away with a paper napkin, teasing her about being so messy.</p><p>Time seemed to drift away from them. Never could Hannah remember enjoying anyone\u2019s company more. It had been like this from the first moment they\u2019d met.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d she said sadly when she noticed the time. It seemed she was always saying that to him.</p><p>He hailed a taxi and sat next to her on the seat. When they arrived outside her parents\u2019 deli, Joshua paid the driver and climbed out of the cab with her.</p><p>On the abandoned sidewalk, Hannah stood with her head bowed, her heart thudding hard and heavy with dread against her chest.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see you again.\u201d The best way was to say it flat out and leave no room for speculation. It was difficult, but necessary.</p><p>\u201cHannah . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m engaged to another man,\u201d she said as firmly as she could manage, afraid her voice would catch with emotion. \u201cI can\u2019t string you along. It isn\u2019t fair to you. Please, Joshua, try to understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do this to me?\u201d he repeated, and it seemed to her that he found encouragement in her words.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to argue with him. She glanced longingly toward the door, wanting this last farewell to be over as quickly as possible. Not wanting to dwell on the unpleasantness of hurting him.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Joshua.\u201d</p><p>He caught her by the shoulders and brought her into his arms. She didn\u2019t resist him. Hadn\u2019t the strength. His kiss was more potent than Irish whiskey. More heady than fine wine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you should be more worried about hurting Carl than me?\u201d he asked, his lips against her hair. \u201cYou said you couldn\u2019t do this to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this to Carl, either,\u201d she said in a rush, her words dwindling to a mere whisper. She squeezed her eyes closed, realizing her mistake. Her first thought had been of Joshua, not Carl.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t love him,\u201d Joshua insisted.</p><p>Hannah backed away from him. \u201cPlease accept this, Joshua. I can\u2019t . . . I won\u2019t see you again.\u201d</p> <p>He opened his mouth, then snapped it closed as if biting off an argument. \u201cIt isn\u2019t in me to make you miserable, Hannah. Nor can I force you into a relationship against your will. I\u2019m here night or day, whenever you need me.\u201d He pulled a business card from his wallet, then wrote something on the back of it. \u201cHere\u2019s my address and phone number. You can reach me twenty-four hours a day. Call me when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake the card anyway.\u201d</p><p>He opened her hand and planted it in her palm, then folded her fingers over it.</p><p>Having done that, he kissed her again until her knees felt as though they would give out on her. She could barely manage to breathe when he lifted his head from hers. He reached up and tenderly slid his index finger down the side of her face.</p> <p>\u201cCall me,\u201d he whispered, his voice low and seductive.</p><p>Pride demanded that she tell him she wouldn\u2019t be making that phone call, but his kiss had stolen her breath away. By the time her lungs had recovered, he\u2019d turned and walked away.</p><p>Realizing she was still clutching the business card, she buried it in her coat pocket and as silently as possible unlocked the door to the deli.</p><p>Soundlessly she made her way up the backstairs to the family apartment. All the lights were out, and Hannah sighed with relief. Her parents had gone to bed.</p><p>Guided by what little moonlight was available, she crept toward her bedroom. Just when she thought she was home free, her father spoke from behind her.</p><p>\u201cHannah?\u201d</p> <p>She swallowed tightly.</p><p>\u201cFor the love of heaven, where have you been? Don\u2019t you have a clue what time it is? Your mother and I have been half sick worrying about you.\u201d</p><p>All through the afternoon, Brynn noticed that Suzie Chang\u2019s eyes avoided hers. Although the teenager didn\u2019t contribute freely to class discussions, if Brynn called upon her, Suzie would willingly share her thoughts.</p><p>Often Brynn had been grateful for Suzie\u2019s contributions. Her other students tended to get sidetracked easily. Brynn had come to rely on Suzie to subtly steer the topic back on course. Reading the teenager generally wasn\u2019t difficult, and Brynn knew from the way Suzie\u2019s eyes brightened when she had something she wanted to say.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that way this afternoon, however. Suzie seemed to be trapped in a world all her own. Knowing the girl was miserable nearly broke Brynn\u2019s heart.</p><p>Brynn blamed herself. It had been wrong for her to look into scholarship possibilities without first discussing the idea with Suzie. Her intentions had been good, but in the process she\u2019d somehow managed to hurt the girl.</p><p>The bell rang, and Brynn stopped Suzie on her way out the door.</p><p>\u201cCould I speak to you for a few moments?\u201d Brynn asked, hoping her voice didn\u2019t betray her worries.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t this afternoon, Miss Cassidy,\u201d the teenager mumbled, her head bowed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll only take a moment, Suzie.\u201d</p><p>The room emptied, and Suzie stood just inside the classroom, her gaze fastened to the floor. She trembled like a frightened rabbit.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about our discussion from the other day,\u201d Brynn began. \u201cRemember I asked you if you had any plans for higher education.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go to college, Miss Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuzie, if I said something to offend you, then I\u2019m truly sorry.\u201d</p><p>The teenager bit into her lower lip, then slowly lifted her head. She offered Brynn a weak smile. \u201cYou didn\u2019t offend me. I was honored that you felt I . . .\u201d She paused, and her dark eyes filled with tears.</p><p>\u201cSuzie?\u201d</p><p>The girl turned away and would have rushed from the room, Brynn suspected, if she hadn\u2019t stopped her.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Brynn asked gently.</p><p>Suzie trembled as she ran the back of her hand under each eye. \u201cI don\u2019t want to trouble you with my problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble,\u201d Brynn assured her gently. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything I can to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t help me, Miss Cassidy. No one can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can try.\u201d With her arm around Suzie\u2019s shoulder, Brynn steered the girl to her desk and handed her a tissue.</p><p>Suzie\u2019s thin shoulders shook with repressed sobs. \u201cOh, Miss Cassidy, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first thing is to dry your eyes. There isn\u2019t anything so terrible that you can\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>Suzie looked up and studied Brynn as though to gauge her sincerity. Brynn met her look without flinching. She hadn\u2019t a clue why Suzie was so unhappy. Naturally she had her suspicions, but she hoped it wasn\u2019t as traumatic as the girl seemed to feel.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go to college,\u201d Suzie announced on a wobbly, emotion-laden breath. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I\u2019ll be able to graduate from high school.\u201d</p><p>Brynn waited, giving the teenager the freedom to continue without the interruption of questions.</p><p>Suzie stiffened and looked away, as if meeting her eyes were more than she could manage. \u201cI haven\u2019t told anyone.\u201d The words were low and filled with trepidation.</p><p>Brynn gripped the younger girl\u2019s hand, and Suzie squeezed her fingers hard enough to cause her pain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The news shouldn\u2019t have surprised Brynn, but it did. Suzie didn\u2019t have a boyfriend at school\u2014in fact, to the best of Brynn\u2019s knowledge, the only social activity Suzie had ever participated in had been the dance at the church.</p><p>\u201cHow far along are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost six months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months!\u201d Brynn couldn\u2019t disguise her surprise.</p><p>\u201cI realize I barely show. . . . I\u2019ve lost weight because I didn\u2019t want anyone to know. I was afraid if my father found out, he\u2019d make me have an abortion,\u201d she said in a rush, her voice barely audible. \u201cI don\u2019t want to kill my baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want this baby, Miss Cassidy. I love him so much already. When I first realized I was pregnant, I thought I would die; then later, after I felt him move . . . it was such an incredible feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe father?\u201d Brynn didn\u2019t want to pry, but surely the baby\u2019s father should be helping Suzie with some of these difficult decisions. Surely he could stand with her when she told her parents.</p><p>\u201cI . . . haven\u2019t told him either.\u201d This was admitted with the same downcast look Suzie had worn earlier.</p><p>\u201cBut, Suzie . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got his own troubles, and I don\u2019t want to burden him with my news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurden him?\u201d Brynn couldn\u2019t keep the irritation out of her voice. \u201cSuzie, this child is his responsibility, too. You shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this alone. There are decisions to be made. For one thing, you won\u2019t be able to hide your condition much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I don\u2019t want him to worry about me. He can\u2019t help, and . . . and if I told him about the baby, it would only make him feel worse. He loves me. I know he does.\u201d She buried her face in her hands, and her shoulders shook with silent tears.</p><p>Brynn patted Suzie\u2019s back gently.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do, Miss Cassidy. I don\u2019t know what will happen when my family learns about the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to tell your parents.\u201d</p><p>Suzie wiped the tears from her face. \u201cI\u2019m afraid my father will make me leave home, and I won\u2019t have anywhere to live. I want to finish high school, and what you said about me getting a scholarship for college, well, I never thought I could do anything like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course you can. Your grades are excellent, but more than that, you have a clear desire to learn. Did you take the SAT test?\u201d</p><p>Suzie shook her head.</p><p>\u201cBut before you consider college, you\u2019re going to need to make a decision about your future, yours and the baby\u2019s. I can\u2019t help you with that, but I do know that the school counselor can help guide you. Will you talk with her?\u201d</p><p>Suzie hesitated, then nodded. \u201cI like Mrs. Christian.\u201d</p><p>Brynn walked down to the office with her and waited while Suzie made an appointment with the school counselor for the next day.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything more I can do, let me know, okay?\u201d Brynn asked when Suzie had finished.</p><p>The teenage girl started to cry once more, and Brynn hugged her close and whispered reassurances. \u201cEverything will work out, Suzie, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>The teenager sniffled and left the school. Silently Brynn returned to her classroom and sagged onto her seat, her heart heavy with Suzie\u2019s news.</p><p>Suzie was pregnant. The girl was little more than a child herself. So tiny and delicate, it was a wonder she\u2019d been able to disguise her pregnancy this long. The fact that she\u2019d gone without prenatal care hadn\u2019t escaped Brynn\u2019s notice, either.</p><p>The desire to wrap her arms around the teenage girl and protect her from the harsh reality of being a single mother nearly overwhelmed Brynn. More than one of her students was a mother. Brynn had been surprised to learn Yolanda had a two-year-old son. The boy stayed with Yolanda\u2019s mother while Yolanda attended classes to complete her education. Denzil had bragged to her about fathering three children. He\u2019d done so in an effort to shock her. The fact that he was sexually active didn\u2019t astound her, but his attitude toward the number of children he\u2019d fathered with different girls did.</p><p>By the time Brynn left the school, she felt as though she carried the weight of the world on her shoulders. It seemed only natural to seek out Father Grady, but the parish priest was gone for the afternoon.</p><p>Mrs. Houghton, his housekeeper, seemed to sense Brynn had come for more than their usual friendly chat. \u201cDo you want me to try to reach Father Grady?\u201d the kindly older woman asked.</p><p>Brynn stood outside on the rectory steps. She shook her head. \u201cNo, that won\u2019t be necessary. I\u2019ll talk to him later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, dearie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Brynn assured her, but she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Blindly she made her way toward the subway station, but as she neared the entrance, she hesitated. The thought of returning to an empty apartment held no appeal. With no clear destination in mind, she turned back, her shoulders slumped and her steps slow.</p><p>Roberto. She needed him. Although she trusted Roberto, she couldn\u2019t tell him about Suzie\u2019s condition. That would be breaking the teenager\u2019s confidence.</p><p>By the time she arrived at his garage, her eyes burned with unshed tears. The tight knot in her throat made it difficult to speak. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Roberto was bent over the hood of a car, and when she walked into the shop, he glanced up. He knew immediately that something wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>\u201cBrynn, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she lied. \u201cWould you mind holding me for a little bit?\u201d she asked, and her voice cracked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate, didn\u2019t question her, but simply did as she requested. Gently he laid aside his tools and brought her into the wide circle of his arms. \u201cI\u2019m greasy,\u201d be advised with regret, his touch light and tender.</p> <p>Brynn burrowed deeper, needing his comfort. \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>His arms came fully around her then as he brought her against his solid strength. The hurt and fear, the disappointment and doubt, produced a hard, bitter tightness in her chest, and she clung to him.</p><p>\u201cBrynn,\u201d Roberto whispered against her hair, stroking it away from her face, \u201ccan you tell me what\u2019s upset you so?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. The dream she\u2019d had for her students seemed to have crumbled at her feet. Suzie had shown such promise, and Brynn had wanted so much for her. An unplanned pregnancy wasn\u2019t the end of the world, but Brynn didn\u2019t want Suzie caught in the trap like so many others. The teenager loved and wanted this child, enough to hide her pregnancy past the time she could have had an abortion. Enough to stand up against the wrath of her family.</p><p>As best she could, Brynn swallowed the emotion. \u201cIt was just one of those days,\u201d she said, drawing in a quick, stabilizing breath.</p> <p>\u201cIt was more than that.\u201d He led her to a stool next to his work bench, and when she was seated, he paced the floor in front of her. \u201cIt\u2019s this neighborhood, isn\u2019t it?\u201d His voice was gruff with anger. \u201cYou don\u2019t belong here. I told you that before and you refused to listen.\u201d He continued muttering in Spanish, knowing full well she couldn\u2019t understand him.</p><p>\u201cRoberto.\u201d She reached out to him, but he ignored her. \u201cStop talking like that. Nothing you say is going to convince me to leave.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his hands clean on a pink flannel rag and then burrowed his splayed fingers through his thick hair, leaving deep indentations.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d known this would upset you, I wouldn\u2019t have come.\u201d Brynn felt bad about that now. \u201cI\u2019m fine, really. There\u2019s nothing you can do except . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he prodded.</p><p>She hesitated and held her arms open to him. \u201cCould you please kiss me?\u201d The world felt right when Roberto held her and loved her.</p> <p>The beginnings of a smile edged up the fringes of his mouth. He walked over to where she sat and captured her upturned face between his callused hands. Her own hands found the curves of his shoulders. He felt stable and strong, and she needed that security. Someone to hold on to while trapped in one of life\u2019s storms.</p><p>\u201cRoberto.\u201d His name came as soft as mist across a Scottish moor.</p><p>He closed his eyes as if struggling against her. She felt his breath against her face and touched his lip with the pad of her index finger. His mouth was moist and warm.</p><p>The simple action was all he seemed to need. Roberto bent forward and claimed her mouth in a long, leisurely kiss. Since the night of the dance, he\u2019d kissed her any number of times. Each episode taught her something more about this man. He\u2019d enthralled her from the first. He felt strongly about his younger brother, accepting responsibility for Emilio\u2019s welfare. At the same time, Roberto cared deeply about the neighborhood, confronting injustice, prejudice, and hatred. Every time she met Father Grady, the priest sang Roberto\u2019s praises. Already she was half in love with him herself.</p><p>She knew a part of Roberto wanted her to quit teaching at Manhattan High. He didn\u2019t want her to deal with the squalor and misery he confronted day in and day out. He\u2019d rather she returned to teaching at the prim and proper girls\u2019 school. Yet at the same time, he was learning, just as she was, that they had a good deal in common. The barriers that had kept them apart seemed to shrink a bit more each time they were together.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ll listen to reason this time.\u201d His lips were less than an inch from her own.</p><p>Brynn linked her arms around his neck and bounced her mouth against his. \u201cJust being with you makes everything seem better. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>His face tightened. \u201cBrynn, for the love of\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She stopped him cold with a long, lingering kiss. When she regained her voice, she whispered, \u201cI\u2019m falling in love with you, Roberto Alcantara.\u201d</p><p>He reacted as if she\u2019d pulled out a gun and fired at him. He groaned and rubbed his hand down his face. \u201cThat\u2019s the last thing I wanted to happen.\u201d He edged away from her until his backside collided with the side panel of the car on which he\u2019d been working moments earlier.</p><p>\u201cRoberto . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know not to tell a man that?\u201d he asked gruffly. Then he whirled around and walked out of the shop as if she\u2019d deeply insulted him.</p><p>The fever felt as if it were about to take the top of her head off as Jenny struggled out of her clothes and into her pajamas. The fever or the bitter pill of disappointment, she didn\u2019t know which.</p><p>Someone knocked against the apartment door.</p><p>\u201cMichelle, can you get that?\u201d Jenny called out before she remembered that her roommate was still at the audition with John Peterman and company.</p><p>Struggling out of bed, Jenny reached for her robe. She\u2019d never looked or felt worse in her life and was in no mood to deal with a door-to-door salesman.</p><p>The knock came a second time, sharp and impatient.</p><p>Grumbling under her breath, she tied the sash loosely around her waist and then unlatched the door lock without checking the peephole first. \u201cWhatever you\u2019re selling, I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>The words left her mouth and collided with a solid male chest. Jenny frowned and slowly looked up.</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t been feeling lightheaded earlier, she felt that way now.</p><p>\u201cTrey,\u201d she whispered, so shocked there was no sound in her voice. He stood bold as life directly in front of her, all six feet four of him. With his Stetson adding another couple of inches to his height, he made for an intimidating figure.</p><p>\u201cJenny?\u201d</p><p>Another woman might have fainted then and there, but by this point Jenny had endured so much that another shock barely fazed her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt certainly looks that way. Can I come inside?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, too numb and too confused to find an excuse to refuse him. Not that she wanted to. He was a hundred times more compelling than she remembered. A hundred times more devastating. He didn\u2019t seem to realize that in New York a man this good-looking generally appeared in fashion magazines.</p><p>\u201cYou should be in bed,\u201d he commented as he walked inside the tiny apartment. He glanced around, and his gaze narrowed as if to say he found it impossible to understand why anyone would choose to live in a place this small. A man who rode the wide-open range would have to feel claustrophobic in New York City, Jenny reflected.</p><p>Despite her shock at seeing him, she maintained her wits. It would serve him right if she told him that she had been in bed and had been forced out of it in order to answer the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in town?\u201d she asked. She gestured toward the sofa.</p><p>Gingerly he sat on the edge of the thin cushion and held on to his cowboy hat with both hands between his parted knees. \u201cWhat am I doing in New York?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat else would someone like me come to this crazy town for? I came to see you, Jenny Lancaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee me?\u201d Now that the excitement had started to fade, Jenny felt the dread take over.</p><p>\u201cYou wrote and said you wouldn\u2019t be home for Christmas, remember? I thought about that, then decided if you wouldn\u2019t come to me, there was no option but for me to visit you.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her head, and her hair, stringy and damp from the snow, fell forward. \u201cI can\u2019t go home, Trey, I just can\u2019t.\u201d The dread was replaced with a heavy sadness.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything for several tense minutes. \u201cYour parents were terribly disappointed.\u201d</p><p>The pain tightened her chest. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was disappointed, too.\u201d</p><p>Slowly she lifted her gaze until their eyes met and held. A woman could get lost and wish never to be found in eyes that dark. Funny she\u2019d never noticed that when she was growing up.</p><p>He continued to hold her look for several breathless moments. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, Jenny.\u201d</p><p>She bit into her lower lip.</p><p>Trey had never been a man for a lot of words. And the years apart hadn\u2019t improved the situation, Jenny noticed. He rotated the brim of his hat in his hands.</p><p>\u201cWhen you first left Custer I thought you\u2019d come to New York and get this singing and dancing craze out of your head. Then when you became so successful, it seemed this was your destiny. But I always counted on seeing you again.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t bear to listen to him repeat the lies she\u2019d fed her family and friends. She bent forward and buried her face in her hands.</p><p>\u201cJenny?\u201d he asked gently, his tender concern ripping at her heart. \u201cDo you need a doctor?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. What she really needed was a priest. Someone who could absolve her from the guilt. Someone who could help her repair the damage she\u2019d done to herself and her family. Someone to show her what to do now.</p><p>He moved from the sofa and knelt on the thin carpet in front of her. As though he weren\u2019t sure what to do next, he placed his hand on her back. \u201cJenny, are you crying?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him, although there wasn\u2019t any use trying to hide it.</p><p>He hesitated, stood, and then reached down and gathered her in his arms. Then, as if she weighed next to nothing, he lifted her from the chair. One moment she was doubled over, struggling to hold back the giant sobs, and the next thing she knew she was being carried.</p><p>\u201cTrey, what are you doing?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cTaking care of you.\u201d He sat back down on the sofa, holding her in his lap, his arms around her. \u201cI never was much good at dealing with a woman\u2019s tears. Holding you just seemed the right thing to do.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his neck and buried her face in his shoulder. For the longest time he did nothing but hold her, and she did nothing but let him.</p><p>\u201cTell me about Charlie,\u201d she begged, wanting to hear everything he could say about her family. Her brother wrote the least of anyone.</p><p>Trey chuckled and rubbed his hand down the side of his lean jaw. \u201cI suspect you\u2019ve heard he\u2019s sweet on Mary Lou.\u201d</p><p>Jenny\u2019s head came off Trey\u2019s chest. \u201cMary Lou Perkins?\u201d That seemed impossible. First off, Mary Lou had been engaged to Brad Harper when Jenny had left Custer. Then she\u2019d learned that the wedding had been called off at the last minute\u2014word was Brad had gotten cold feet. But Jenny had assumed that the two would eventually marry.</p><p>Trey grinned. \u201cCharlie\u2019s right sweet on her, and after three years Brad may just have lost his girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt serves Brad Harper right. He had his chance,\u201d she said, siding with her brother. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She felt Trey\u2019s smile against her hair. \u201cLast I heard, Charlie and Mary Lou had decided to announce their engagement to the community on Christmas Day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t be there. One more nail in the coffin of her guilt.</p><p>\u201cIf you won\u2019t be there for Christmas, Jenny, will you come home for your brother\u2019s wedding?\u201d</p><p>Ten</p> <p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to help Jenny?\u201d Goodness asked. The three crowded in the corner of the tiny living room, hovering over Trey and Jenny.</p><p>Mercy knew that her friend had a soft heart. In fact, it was Goodness\u2019s tender nature plus her weakness for electronic devices that had been the main source of their difficulties over the last couple of years. To be fair, Goodness had matured. Either that or she\u2019d become accustomed to such things as fifty-two-inch television screens. Not once in the past two Christmases had Goodness appeared on pay-per-view. Mercy was downright proud of her friend\u2019s progress.</p><p>\u201cMercy,\u201d Goodness snapped. \u201cI asked you something important.\u201d</p><p>The warm thoughts Mercy had entertained about her fellow prayer ambassador vanished. \u201cI brought Trey LaRue to New York, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did that?\u201d Shirley joined them and sounded downright impressed. Mercy\u2019s evaluation of the third angel rose by several degrees.</p> <p>Mercy was proud of her efforts and grateful someone had noticed. She tucked her thumbs in her waistband and rocked back on her heels. \u201cYou\u2019re darn tootin\u2019 I brought Trey LaRue to town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been hanging around cowpokes again,\u201d Goodness whispered out of the side of her mouth. \u201cShe\u2019s starting to talk just like one of \u2019em. The next thing we know she\u2019ll be wearing a buckle as big as a chastity belt and bragging about her rat-chasing dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me,\u201d Mercy contradicted. \u201cI\u2019ve been too busy arranging Trey\u2019s trip east. I found he isn\u2019t as susceptible to suggestion as some humans are, especially schoolteachers and young Jewish women\u2014if you catch my drift. I had my work cut out just getting him to New York. Must\u2019ve taken three or four people suggesting he visit Jenny for him to take the hint.\u201d</p><p>Goodness frowned and apparently didn\u2019t take Mercy\u2019s words kindly.</p><p>\u201cBut look what happened to Jenny while you were away,\u201d Shirley commented glumly. \u201cShe\u2019s sick. My goodness, the poor girl looks wretched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat couldn\u2019t be helped.\u201d There was only so much one angel could do, and no one seemed to appreciate Mercy\u2019s efforts on this assignment. Least of all her two best friends.</p> <p>\u201cHas Jenny told him the truth yet?\u201d Goodness asked, making herself comfortable. She usually preferred to dangle from light fixtures, but not in these tight quarters. \u201cShe isn\u2019t going to be able to keep it from him, is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now,\u201d Mercy agreed. It wouldn\u2019t do any good to remind her companions that she could lead a horse to water, but she couldn\u2019t make him saddle himself. She paused. Was that how the saying went? She\u2019d heard some smart-talkin\u2019 fellow in Montana say something along those lines, and at the time it had made perfect sense.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this I heard about Jenny\u2019s brother?\u201d Shirley asked impatiently. \u201cIs he really getting engaged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s another thing.\u201d Mercy flung herself across the back of a living room chair and supported her head with the palm of her hand. \u201cDoes anyone here understand what I had to go through to arrange this last-minute romance between Charles Lancaster and Mary Lou Perkins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did that?\u201d Shirley asked, amazed.</p><p>\u201cWell, not entirely,\u201d Mercy admitted with some reluctance, although she\u2019d be willing to accept a certain amount of credit. \u201cAll Charlie really needed was a little encouragement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you supplied that?\u201d</p><p>Mercy shrugged. \u201cSome.\u201d</p> <p>Goodness beamed her approval. \u201cGood thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about poor Jenny?\u201d Shirley asked, studying the down-and-out actress.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Mercy admitted. \u201cWhat she does and doesn\u2019t tell Trey is up to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will Trey be in town?\u201d</p><p>Mercy didn\u2019t have the answer to that, either. \u201cYour guess is as good as mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be here for the party, won\u2019t he?\u201d Goodness wanted to know.</p><p>It took Mercy a moment to remember the Christmas potluck Jenny and Michelle were holding. She hadn\u2019t a clue where the two young actresses intended on putting everyone, but they seemed to think they could manage.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what Trey\u2019s plans are,\u201d she muttered. It seemed her friends insisted upon asking her questions she couldn\u2019t answer. \u201cAll I know is that however long he stays, it\u2019ll be long enough.\u201d</p><p>Her words were followed by a short silence. \u201cAre you saying you know something we don\u2019t?\u201d Shirley inquired.</p><p>Mercy\u2019s smug smile was all the answer she intended to give them.</p><p>Brynn stood in front of her class, and her gaze rested on Suzie Chang\u2019s empty desk in the middle of the room. It seemed as if the space were magnified until it appeared to crowd everyone against the walls.</p><p>The lessons that day involved the history of the Second World War, and although Brynn was prepared to discuss the Battle of the Bulge, her mind was elsewhere.</p><p>All she could think about was Suzie.</p><p>\u201cThis afternoon,\u201d Brynn said, forcing her attention back to the history lesson, \u201cwe are going to be talking about . . . sex.\u201d The word raced out of her mouth before she could stop herself.</p><p>Modesto cheered and sat up straighter on his desk chair. \u201cHey, Miss Cassidy, I bet I could teach you more than you could teach me.\u201d He laughed, thinking himself downright comical.</p><p>\u201cNot if my brother hears about it,\u201d Emilio warned, his eyes narrowing. \u201cMiss Cassidy is his woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no one\u2019s woman,\u201d Brynn corrected evenly.</p><p>\u201cNo one owns another person,\u201d Pearl Washington insisted righteously. To the best of Brynn\u2019s knowledge, this was the first time the young black girl had freely contributed to any class discussion. \u201cA woman\u2019s body is her own, just the way a boy\u2019s body is his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t plan this talk,\u201d Brynn admitted, wondering if she was treading over a minefield. \u201cBut this is a subject that\u2019s been on my mind lately, and I\u2019d like us to have an open discussion. I\u2019ll share my thoughts with you, and you can share your feelings with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me anything you want,\u201d Emilio said proudly.</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you\u2019ve got all the answers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Emilio glanced over his shoulder to be sure he had his friends\u2019 support. \u201cMost of us in class do. Come on, Miss Cassidy, we been around, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do know. But making love isn\u2019t like sampling chocolates. It\u2019s much more involved than that. There are responsibilities and consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m raising one of those consequences right now,\u201d Yolanda volunteered, \u201cand it ain\u2019t easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, sister, don\u2019t look at me. I wasn\u2019t the one who got you knocked up.\u201d Denzil raised both hands in a gesture of innocence.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Denzil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to talk about accountability,\u201d Brynn said, ignoring the two. \u201cAbout being mature enough to accept the responsibility for our actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to lecture us, Teach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m going to share with you at least fifteen different ways of making love without doing it.\u201d</p><p>Several of the boys glanced back and forth at each other as if she\u2019d suddenly turned into someone they didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cI have the feeling I\u2019m not going to like any of those ways,\u201d Malcolm muttered.</p><p>Pearl stood at her desk and pointed a finger at her chest. \u201cWhy is it a guy thinks that because he spends a little money on me, it entitles him to a piece of my soul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome girls expect it,\u201d Malcolm argued just as heatedly. \u201cHalf the time the girls are all over me asking for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Emilio agreed. \u201cThere are plenty of times I\u2019d prefer not to . . . you know, and if I don\u2019t ask, then the girl\u2019s feelings are all hurt. It ain\u2019t just us men, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen?\u201d Yolanda challenged. \u201cI notice you call us girls, but you\u2019re men. Why doesn\u2019t the man who fathered Jason kindly step forward?\u201d With her fists braced against her sides, Yolanda looked around slowly, then released a sigh of disgust. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Brynn said, putting an end to the argument before it escalated into a shouting match. She could talk until she was ready to faint, and she doubted it would do any good, but she had to try. One thing was clear: her students were as opinionated over the topic as she was herself.</p><p>While she had their attention, she spoke from the heart, listing the reasons she felt it was important to wait to experiment with lovemaking until after marriage. The intensity of her feelings must have reached her class because there was a respectful silence when she finished.</p><p>\u201cMiss Cassidy,\u201d Emilio said when she\u2019d concluded, \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be discourteous or anything, but you\u2019re living in a dream world if you believe a man\u2019s going to wait to make love to his woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure, Emilio. Teenagers across the world are making pledges to keep themselves pure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere ain\u2019t nothing pure in this neighborhood,\u201d someone else told her. \u201cNot even the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it has to start somewhere,\u201d Brynn said, and walked over to the chipped blackboard. In large bold-faced letters, she wrote i will abstain from premarital sex. \u201cI say let it start with me.\u201d She signed her name below.</p><p>Holding up the piece of chalk, she asked, \u201cAnyone else?\u201d</p><p>A tense moment passed before Yolanda slid from her seat. With her head held high, the teenager walked up and took the chalk out of Brynn\u2019s hand. She wrote her name in huge letters below Brynn\u2019s.</p><p>Turning around to face the class, she said, \u201cA boy will tell you anything you want to hear until you give him what he wants. Then he\u2019ll forget he ever knew you. A man will make you his wife first.\u201d</p><p>Pearl Washington walked up and wrote her name down next. She turned around and glared at Denzil. Then, one hand braced against her hip, Pearl returned to her desk. On the walk back to the end of the row, she continued to glare at Denzil.</p><p>\u201cI think you just got cut off, man,\u201d Malcolm whispered loudly enough for everyone in the class to hear.</p><p>\u201cYou keep saying how much you love me,\u201d Pearl mocked him. \u201cIf you love me so much, prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t adding my name to that list,\u201d Denzil shouted angrily.</p><p>Pearl blinked several times but said nothing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry, Pearl, Denzil is nothing but a boy,\u201d Yolanda said to comfort the other girl. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she least expected it, Mike rose from his seat and walked forward. With a bit of flare he added his name to the list, the first boy in class to do so.</p><p>\u201cOh sure, Mike,\u201d Malcolm called sarcastically. \u201cYou should be so lucky to get laid.\u201d</p><p>Why the others chose to taunt Mike, Brynn didn\u2019t understand. She liked Mike and appreciated the courage it had taken for him to step forward. The desire to defend him was strong, but she realized that would only make matters worse for the youth.</p><p>\u201cMike\u2019s more of a man than you are,\u201d Pearl insisted. \u201cA hell of a lot more than Denzil will ever be.\u201d</p> <p>Emilio sat on his seat, frowning. After a couple of moments he stood and trekked the short distance to the blackboard.</p><p>\u201cEmilio, are you nuts, man?\u201d Modesto asked.</p><p>Emilio turned around and faced his friends. \u201cYou know what? Miss Cassidy is right. My brother\u2019s always talking about what it means to be responsible, and really that\u2019s all Miss Cassidy is saying, too. I ain\u2019t no priest, but the way I figure it, women will respect me if they know I ain\u2019t after nothing.\u201d</p><p>After Emilio listed his name, three other male students added their promise.</p><p>When they\u2019d finished, Brynn took the chalk, stepped to the blackboard, and wrote i will practice safe sex. Then she drew a line beneath the words and waited.</p> <p>\u201cNext we\u2019re going to discuss protection,\u201d she said.</p><p>Later that afternoon, after her class had been dismissed for the day, Brynn felt good about the spontaneous way in which they\u2019d discussed the subject of sex. It might have gone differently had she planned it. Instead the students themselves had contributed their feelings and insights, and because she\u2019d listened to them, they had been willing to hear her out as well.</p><p>She studied each name on the two lists and prayed that their talk would make a difference in how they chose to live their lives.</p><p>\u201cMiss Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>Brynn looked up to find Suzie standing in the doorway. \u201cAm I disturbing you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Brynn stood. \u201cHow did your session go with Mrs. Christian?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right, I guess. She made an appointment for me at the health clinic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy baby\u2019s healthy,\u201d Suzie said with a shy smile. \u201cI feel him kick and move all the time now.\u201d The teenager\u2019s gaze moved to the blackboard. \u201cI . . . I heard about what you did. It\u2019s all over the school. You talked about birth control and responsible sex because of me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Brynn couldn\u2019t very well deny it. \u201cI didn\u2019t break your confidence, Suzie. No one knows what you told me.\u201d She felt it was important to assure Suzie of that.</p><p>\u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t say anything.\u201d Suzie studied the list. \u201cEmilio signed his name.\u201d Although it was a statement, the surprise in her voice made it a question.</p><p>\u201cSeveral of the young men in class did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I could add my name?\u201d she asked, diverting her eyes from Brynn\u2019s. \u201cOr is it too late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be proud if you did,\u201d Brynn told her.</p> <p>Suzie walked up and added her name to the first list. \u201cI\u2019m going to talk to my mother this afternoon. She\u2019ll be angry with me and she\u2019ll want me to tell her who the father is, but I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t protect him forever,\u201d Brynn said gently.</p><p>\u201cI know. Mom will be angry, but not nearly as much as my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to come with you?\u201d Brynn asked.</p><p>Suzie considered the offer, then shook her head. \u201cNo, but thank you for volunteering.\u201d</p><p>No sooner had Suzie left than Brynn was asked to come down to the office. It was the first time she\u2019d received such a request. She wasn\u2019t left to wonder at the reason.</p><p>She knew.</p><p>If what Suzie said was true, then Mr. Whalen, the principal, had heard what she\u2019d done.</p><p>Allen Whalen invited her into his office, and after she\u2019d stepped inside, he closed the door firmly. The sound of it clicking alerted her to the fact that this wasn\u2019t going to be a friendly chat.</p><p>Brynn respected Allen Whalen. He was a big, no-nonsense man and a fair disciplinarian. He had zero tolerance for drugs and alcohol and didn\u2019t shy away from confrontations, often suspending students for fighting or other disruptions. Emilio could testify to that.</p><p>\u201cSit down, Brynn,\u201d Allen said, and motioned for her to take a seat on the other side of his desk. More than likely this was the identical chair in which Emilio had sat the first day of the quarter following his fight with Grover.</p><p>\u201cFirst off,\u201d Allen said, leaning forward, \u201cI want you to know I\u2019ve heard good things about you. The kids seem to feel kindly toward you, and that\u2019s a plus. I understand you\u2019ve made a point to visit the families of your students.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile your efforts are commendable,\u201d Allen interrupted, \u201cI don\u2019t feel it\u2019s a good idea for you to become emotionally involved with your students.\u201d</p><p>Brynn opened her mouth to explain her purpose, but once again she wasn\u2019t allowed to continue.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re young, and idealistic. Perhaps a little too young to deal with the reality of our situation here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Whalen, if you\u2019d allow me to explain . . .\u201d</p><p>He gestured with his hand, indicating that he wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cI had my doubts about this government project. As far as I\u2019m concerned, the less the federal government has to do with the school system, the better. I would never have agreed to this program had I realized . . .\u201d He paused and leaned forward, pressing his elbows against the top of his cluttered desk. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get sidetracked here. The reason I asked you to my office has nothing to do with the government or why you\u2019re at Manhattan High.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She sat straight, her back as stiff as a steel pipe.</p><p>\u201cI received a phone call from two mothers this afternoon,\u201d he prefaced, his face growing tight with displeasure. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me, Miss Cassidy, that you actually discussed birth control methods with your history class.\u201d</p><p>Rather than hedge, Brynn answered him in a straightforward manner. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I did.\u201d</p><p>Allen Whalen\u2019s eyes drifted closed momentarily. \u201cIn your history class, Miss Cassidy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt needed to be said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you felt you were the most qualified to advise a classroom full of young adults? I take it you\u2019ve attended the course the district requires before teaching sex education?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The discussion was spontaneous. I certainly didn\u2019t plan to spend the afternoon discussing the benefits of condoms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you just decided this needed to be said and you were the one to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you put it like that, then I have no option but to say yes.\u201d She had no defense and didn\u2019t think it would help her case if she had.</p><p>Mr. Whalen mulled over her answers. \u201cIn case you weren\u2019t aware of it, this community is largely Catholic.\u201d</p><p>Brynn folded her hands on her lap. \u201cI\u2019m Catholic myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is no excuse,\u201d he said, then stopped abruptly. \u201cYou\u2019re Catholic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Cassidy and my hair is red.\u201d She didn\u2019t mean to be sarcastic, but it should have been obvious.</p><p>\u201cThen you must be aware of the church\u2019s standing on the subject of birth control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am indeed.\u201d She didn\u2019t blink. Didn\u2019t hesitate. Didn\u2019t doubt for an instant that he was furious with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid, Miss Cassidy, that in light of this admission, I have no choice but to place a letter of reprimand in your file.\u201d</p><p>Brynn swallowed tightly. \u201cI\u2019ve always known you to be a fair man. If you feel I deserve to be formally reprimanded for my actions, then I can only assume that you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a history and English teacher. In the future please remember that.\u201d He reached for a piece of paper and started writing.</p><p>Brynn sat where she was for several awkward moments.</p><p>After a while, he glanced up. \u201cYou may leave.\u201d</p><p>When Brynn walked out of the office, she found three secretaries staring at her. Their looks were sympathetic as she whisked past. The whispers started the moment she was around the corner.</p><p>\u201cHello, Hannah.\u201d</p><p>Hannah looked up from the novel she was reading. \u201cCarl,\u201d she said, unable to hide her surprise and her guilt. No one had told her he planned to stop by that evening. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d She hadn\u2019t spoken to him since his bout with the flu.</p><p>Her fianc\u00e9 claimed the recliner across from her. \u201cMuch better, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Hannah noted that her heart didn\u2019t leap with excitement the way it did whenever she saw Joshua. Nor did she experience a twinge of pleasure just because they were together. Carl was Carl. Dedicated, devout, determined. But soon, if everything went as their mothers had planned, he would be more than an unexpected guest. He would be her husband.</p><p>\u201cMy mother stopped by to talk to your mother,\u201d he explained with a wry grin. \u201cThey\u2019re discussing the details of the wedding.\u201d</p><p>Hannah\u2019s gaze fell back to the pages of the novel. \u201cMy mother wants to hire a wedding coordinator,\u201d she told him. \u201cI heard her discussing the matter over the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must have been talking to my mother, because I heard her say something about it as well.\u201d</p><p>Hannah smiled and looked away. She noticed with regret that they didn\u2019t seem to have a whole lot to say to each other.</p><p>\u201cI thought we should set a time to shop for the engagement ring,\u201d Carl suggested, almost as if he were grateful for something to discuss.</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about after the first of the year?\u201d he proposed.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d The further into the future, the better.</p><p>A disjointed silence followed, as though there were nothing left to say.</p><p>\u201cCarl.\u201d Her father\u2019s face lit up with delight as he walked into the living room. \u201cRuth didn\u2019t mention that you were coming.\u201d</p><p>Carl stood, and the two men exchanged hearty handshakes. David Morganstern slapped Hannah\u2019s fianc\u00e9 across the back. \u201cBy heaven, it\u2019s good to see you. You\u2019ve been making yourself scarce around here these last few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuth said you\u2019d come down with a twenty-four-hour bug the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine now.\u201d</p><p>Hannah watched as the transformation took place in the man who was to be her husband. It seemed his face brightened as soon as her father walked into the room.</p><p>Soon the two entered into a lively debate over some political matter that didn\u2019t interest Hannah. While they chatted, Hannah went into the kitchen, brewed tea, and served that along with freshly baked sugar cookies.</p><p>Helen Rabinsky and Hannah\u2019s mother were engrossed in their own conversation and seemed unaware of her. As she expected, the women were debating the pros and cons of hiring a wedding coordinator. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After a time, Hannah escaped to her bedroom and closed the door. She doubted anyone would miss her.</p><p>Sitting on top of her bed, her knees bent, Hannah closed her eyes and remembered her time with Joshua at the skating rink. It wasn\u2019t right that she should be thinking of another man. Not with Carl on the other side of the door.</p><p>Joshua\u2019s business card remained inside her coat pocket, but she didn\u2019t need to retrieve it to find the number. In the last two days, she\u2019d stared at that card so often, she\u2019d committed the phone number to memory.</p><p>When she feared she might be missed, Hannah returned to the living room. Carl glanced her way and smiled affectionately.</p> <p>\u201cCarl,\u201d she said, \u201cwould you like to go for a walk, or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA walk?\u201d he repeated with a decided lack of enthusiasm. \u201cIt\u2019s below freezing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about if we went ice skating?\u201d she suggested next.</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into that daughter of mine,\u201d her father commented, and chuckled. \u201cTwo nights ago she walks over to Rockefeller Center and goes ice skating.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t skate,\u201d Carl said with a touch of sadness.</p><p>\u201cI could teach you,\u201d she offered expectantly. \u201cIt isn\u2019t difficult, and we could have a lot of fun.\u201d</p><p>Carl looked from Hannah to her father and then back again. \u201cWould you mind if we stayed here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember your young man\u2019s just getting over the flu, Hannah,\u201d her father reminded her gently. \u201cCarl will take you ice skating another time.\u201d</p><p>She tried to hide her disappointment and must have succeeded. An hour later, Helen Rabinsky announced it was time to leave. Carl stood, and for no reason Hannah could fathom the two of them were left alone. It didn\u2019t take her long to realize her family was giving her and Carl a private moment together.</p><p>\u201cThanks for stopping by, Carl,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt was good to see you again, Hannah.\u201d He leaned forward and pressed his mouth to hers. It was a gentle kiss, but passionless. It was unfair to compare the kisses she\u2019d shared with Joshua to the quick exchanges between her and Carl. But Hannah couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>Joshua\u2019s kisses made her feel as though she\u2019d been hit by a freight train. The emotional impact left her reeling long afterward. She knew that her kisses affected him in the same magical, exciting way. Joshua made her feel like a sensual, alluring woman.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be calling you soon,\u201d Carl promised.</p><p>Hannah nodded, afraid to speak for fear of what she\u2019d say. Intuitively she realized she couldn\u2019t marry Carl. He didn\u2019t love her any more than she loved him. He was as miserable about this arrangement as she was, but they were both caught in the trap. One of them had to break it.</p><p>As soon as Hannah and her parents were alone, her mother turned and clapped her hands gleefully. \u201cHelen agrees that we should hire a wedding coordinator. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased. She suggested we talk to Wanda Thorndike.\u201d She hugged Hannah briefly. \u201cI\u2019ll make an appointment with Wanda first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Hannah wanted to object, to explain that she felt they were rushing matters, but she wasn\u2019t given the opportunity.</p><p>\u201cI overheard Carl suggest that he and Hannah pick out engagement rings right after the first of the year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid,\u201d her mother said, sighing, \u201cyou can\u2019t imagine everything we need to consider for a large wedding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t picked a date yet,\u201d Hannah reminded her family, dread weighing down her words.</p><p>\u201cMy dear, you\u2019re as naive as Helen and I were about all this. The wedding coordinator will be the one to choose that. She\u2019ll know what\u2019s available and when. Personally I\u2019d prefer a June wedding. You should be a traditional June bride, but that\u2019s barely six months away, and I don\u2019t know if we could manage it in that time. One thing I\u2019m going to have to insist we do right away, and that\u2019s shop for your dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelen was telling me it sometimes takes as long as six months to have a dress made and delivered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, darling, we\u2019re throwing a lot at you. Just be patient.\u201d Humming happily to herself, Ruth Morganstern returned to the kitchen and the wedding brochures she\u2019d pored over only moments earlier.</p><p>Hannah\u2019s father chuckled. \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ve last seen your mother so pleased. This wedding has given her a renewed lease on life.\u201d</p><p>Hannah couldn\u2019t find it in her heart to disappoint them. Not then. Later, she promised herself. She\u2019d sit down with them both and explain that she didn\u2019t love Carl.</p><p>By noon the following day the deli was filled with the usual lunch crowd. Her father hand-sliced pastrami into thick wedges while Hannah and her mother assembled the sandwiches.</p><p>Runners delivered orders as fast as they could be packed.</p><p>The routine was one in which Hannah had worked most of her life. She never questioned that she would help in the deli; it was assumed.</p><p>Around two, the heavy lunch crowd had begun to thin out. Her mother returned to the kitchen to make up a fresh batch of potato salad. Her father was preoccupied with ordering supplies when Hannah looked up to discover Joshua standing on the other side of the counter.</p><p>\u201cJoshua,\u201d she whispered in a low rush of air. Just seeing him again had knocked the breath out of her. She couldn\u2019t disguise her delight. Her heart went into second gear as she glanced over her shoulder to be sure no one was paying them any mind. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cI came for lunch.\u201d</p><p>Of course. She reached for a pencil, prepared to take his order.</p><p>He read the printed menu that hung on the wall behind her. \u201cI\u2019ll have a pastrami on rye and a cup of coffee.\u201d</p><p>She wrote down his order with trembling hands.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to make it for me yourself?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, avoiding eye contact. She wouldn\u2019t be able to hide how pleased she was to see him again if she looked up.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t phone,\u201d he whispered just loudly enough for her to hear.</p><p>\u201cPotato is the soup of the day,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHannah, look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and braced herself \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want my business?\u201d</p><p>He was making this difficult.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve thought about contacting me, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Again she didn\u2019t answer. \u201cWould you care for a bowl of soup with your sandwich?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond for a number of seconds, and then, \u201cThe only thing I want is you, Hannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll take a number, I\u2019ll have your lunch delivered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you bring it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Her nod was nearly imperceptible. She saw the tension leave him and couldn\u2019t keep from glancing up and offering him a quick smile. It took only a moment or more to finish compiling his sandwich. She carried that and a cup of coffee to his table and was pleased to note he sat as far away from the counter as possible.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Hannah,\u201d he said when she placed the plate on the table. \u201cWould you care to join me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Her hands folded over the back of the chair across from him. She glanced over her shoulder, fearing her father would notice the two of them together.</p><p>\u201cIs that your father?\u201d Joshua asked, looking around her.</p><p>\u201cYes. Mom\u2019s in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t look like the kind of man who would force his daughter into a loveless marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoshua, please.\u201d</p><p>He picked up the sandwich, and once again, Hannah looked back to make sure no one was watching her. \u201cI sometimes walk by the pond in Central Park,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Joshua went still. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking of taking a stroll there this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn an hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Joshua\u2019s handsome face broke into a wide grin. \u201cI\u2019ve always favored walking as an excellent form of exercise.\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re up to this?\u201d Trey asked Jenny for the third time since they\u2019d boarded the ferry headed for Ellis Island.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have suggested sight-seeing if I wasn\u2019t feeling better,\u201d Jenny insisted. They stood and watched as the New York skyline began to fade into the distance. \u201cI want you to visit Ellis Island,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s an emotional experience, at least it was for me the first time I made the trip. I found my great-grandfather\u2019s name there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour great-grandfather? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI looked his name up on the computer. It showed me the year he arrived from Germany and his age at the time. I felt as though I\u2019d stumbled upon an open treasure chest, only this one contained a part of my heritage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis was your mother\u2019s grandfather?\u201d</p><p>Jenny answered him with a quick nod. \u201cCan you imagine packing everything you own in this world in a single suitcase?\u201d she asked, awed by the raw courage and grit her great-grandfather had shown when he was little more than a teenager. \u201cHe came to America with nothing but his dreams and the desire for a new life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so unusual?\u201d Trey asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course it is,\u201d she answered, feeling slightly offended that Trey didn\u2019t recognize the fortitude and faith her great-grandfather had demonstrated. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have an easy life here, you know. First off he didn\u2019t speak the language, and although he was well educated he was forced into taking a menial job. For years he and my great-grandmother struggled to make a decent life for themselves and their family. I can\u2019t tell you how much I admire them for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you did, leaving Montana for a chance on Broadway, wasn\u2019t all that different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Jenny didn\u2019t see the correlation. Of course there was the obvious one, but her great-grandfather had come to America friendless and without the loving support of his family.</p><p>\u201cAs I recall, when you left Custer you went with a solitary suitcase. You came to the Big Apple without a job, with little money, and with only your dreams to feed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d she admitted reluctantly, not wanting Trey to continue comparing her with her great-grandfather. Not when she fell so far short.</p><p>Trey placed his hand on her shoulder. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been easy for you, has it?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know the half of it. Jenny turned her face into the wind and let the breeze off the Hudson River buffet against her. The thickness in her throat tightened to painful proportions, and she knew she dared not try to talk. Trey had tried to paint her as some kind of heroine, seeking her way in a new world. In retrospect, Jenny wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d done the right thing to leave Montana. She wasn\u2019t sure she was cut out for life in the city. In three years she\u2019d never managed to feel at home in New York. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jenny didn\u2019t see herself as any modern-day champion.</p><p>\u201cJenny?\u201d</p><p>Trey\u2019s face had knit into a worried frown.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing great,\u201d she told him quickly, perhaps too quickly, because she felt his close scrutiny. Smiling, just then, would have been impossible.</p> <p>Trey moved closer to her by the railing. The wind hit against him. His arm came loosely around her shoulder, and, needing him, she pressed her head against his solid strength.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something you should know,\u201d she said after dragging a deep breath through her lungs. She closed her eyes, unwilling to continue the pretense any longer. \u201cI\u2019m not what you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJenny\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please, let me finish.\u201d This was so much more difficult than she\u2019d thought it would be. Trey had come all this way from Montana thinking she was a Broadway star. Either she told him herself or he\u2019d learn it on his own.</p><p>A dozen times since his arrival she\u2019d been tempted to blurt out the truth. It had held her prisoner, tortured her, and she couldn\u2019t stand the pressure any longer.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not starring in an Off Broadway production of South Pacific. I\u2019m a waitress, a singing waitress. I lied, and I want you to know how very sorry I am.\u201d Her voice pitched and heaved with emotion as she hurried to get all the words out at once for fear she\u2019d break down and weep.</p><p>The pressure of his arm around her increased slightly. \u201cI realized that right away.\u201d</p><p>He knew and hadn\u2019t said anything.</p><p>\u201cThe first place I headed when I arrived in New York was the theater. I wanted to see you perform.\u201d</p><p>Jenny\u2019s throat constricted. \u201cI\u2019m so ashamed to have lied, but I had to tell my family something. It\u2019s been so long, and . . . you\u2019ve got to believe I gave it my best shot, and now, well, now it seems I\u2019m buried neck deep in the lie. Mom and Dad are so proud of me, and they\u2019ve told everyone, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome home, Jenny.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her response was automatic and sharp.</p><p>The brightness in Trey\u2019s eyes dimmed, and she turned away, unable to meet his gaze. It sounded as if he were eager to hear she\u2019d failed. Glad of it. Well, she wasn\u2019t through yet. She was close, so close she could taste it. If John Peterman didn\u2019t want her for this play, then there were other parts, other producers. She wouldn\u2019t give up. She refused to turn her back when she was this close. Not even Trey could convince her to do that.</p><p>\u201cI may not be the star I led everyone to believe,\u201d she told him stiffly, \u201cbut I\u2019m an actress, and a damn talented one. I realize I\u2019ve probably disappointed you, and I\u2019m sorry for that, but I\u2019m not willing to throw in the towel yet.\u201d</p><p>Trey didn\u2019t answer her, and the air between them was strained and tight.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have asked it of you,\u201d he said as the boat neared Ellis Island.</p><p>It was as close to an apology as she was likely to get from Trey. She stepped away from him, letting the breeze whip against her face while she mulled over his words.</p><p>Trey stepped back, and she noticed the attention he generated with his tall, lean good looks. He was obviously out of place with his scuffed snakeskin boots and weather-beaten Stetson, yet he\u2019d dressed in the height of fashion. Jenny knew more than one male model who would have given anything for that rawboned, natural look.</p><p>\u201cJenny,\u201d Trey said, coming to stand next to her, \u201cI don\u2019t really think what you did was so terrible. Sure you stretched the truth a bit, but under the circumstances that\u2019s understandable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut hardly commendable.\u201d</p><p>Trey didn\u2019t agree or disagree. \u201cWhat you did was burden yourself. It seems to me these New York theater people must have holes in their heads not to realize how talented you are.\u201d</p><p>This was what Jenny loved about home the most. When it came to talent, the good folks in Custer believed none had more than Jenny Lancaster.</p><p>\u201cThose responsible for the theater in New York meet lots of talented men and women with big dreams and a lot of ambition. That was a difficult lesson for me to learn, and I suspect that in some ways I haven\u2019t completely accepted it. I\u2019m good, Trey, and I know it, but there are any number of equally talented people just waiting for their big break, the same way as me.\u201d</p><p>The ferry docked and the passengers disembarked onto the island. Most everyone headed directly for the Ellis Island Immigration Museum.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I want you to see first,\u201d Jenny said, leading Trey toward the flagpole. A brass railing-like border ran the circumference of the island. Embossed in the polished metal were hundreds of names, a small representation of the thousands of immigrants who\u2019d made their way to America between 1892 and 1924. The first time Jenny had visited, she\u2019d walked around the entire island until she\u2019d found what she was looking for.</p><p>\u201cMy great-grandfather\u2019s name is listed here,\u201d she told him excitedly. Her fingertips ran over the raised letters. Anton Hellmich. A sense of pride moved her to know that this man\u2019s blood ran through her veins. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how excited I was when I discovered this. I called my mother that very night.\u201d She doubted that Trey understood what a rare thing it was for her to phone home. With her finances so tight, Jenny usually wrote letters and made up excuses why it was difficult for her to phone. Talking to her mother, hearing her father\u2019s gruff, loving voice, increased her longing for home and her family all the more.</p><p>\u201cAnton Hellmich,\u201d Trey repeated slowly. He placed his callused hand on top of hers and laced their fingers together. His skin was rough and hard from the long hours he worked his spread. Her skin was silky smooth.</p><p>Once again Trey ran the thick pad of his index finger over the raised letters with her. His touch, so warm and caring, so gentle, was like a healing balm to her wounded pride.</p><p>Barely realizing what she was doing, Jenny turned so that she faced him. Before another moment passed, before her heart could beat again, Trey\u2019s arms were clasped around her as he brought her into his arms.</p><p>She watched the transformation come over him, as if he were caught in some winless battle. The muscles in his jaw clenched. Then, moving slowly, as though hypnotized, he lowered his mouth to hers. His lips over hers, moist and warm, were as gentle as lambskin.</p><p>Jenny closed her eyes as tightly as she could, seeking to blot out the world and everything around them. Everything but Trey. For the first time since her arrival she didn\u2019t want to be subjected to the sights and sounds of the New York waterfront. She didn\u2019t want to hear the buzz of aircraft overhead. For this one moment she wanted to be as far away from other people as she could get.</p><p>Trey\u2019s kiss was everything Jenny had ever dreamed, everything she could have anticipated. She trembled in his arms, needing his strength, his comfort, more than she\u2019d ever needed anything in her life. She clung to him, not wanting him to let her go. Not ever.</p><p>Snuggling closer, she stood on the tips of her toes. Her breasts nuzzled his chest, and a new brand of sensations shot through her. Trey recognized the difference, and his tongue went in search of hers as the kiss deepened. By the time they broke apart, Jenny\u2019s knees were weak. It didn\u2019t seem possible that anything would feel this wonderful.</p><p>Jenny had been kissed before, plenty of times. She wasn\u2019t a novice to the art, but with Trey all things became new. Everything changed.</p><p>When they broke apart, Jenny could feel the heat invade her cheeks. She was actually blushing, which was something that hadn\u2019t happened since she was in junior high.</p><p>\u201cTrey?\u201d she whispered, pleading with him to explain what was happening to them. She was at a loss to understand, let alone explain.</p><p>He answered by kissing her again, this time deeper and with such intensity that her senses spun out of control. When he\u2019d finished, he held her close and whispered, but his words were low and filled with emotion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited so long to hold you like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Trey, I\u2019ve missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>His fingers were in her hair, and he angled her head to kiss her again and again. His breathing was harsh with excitement and need.</p><p>\u201cCome home, Jenny,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cFor the love of God, give up on this madness and come back home where you belong.\u201d</p><p>The pond near Cherry Hill fountain had always been one of Hannah\u2019s favorite spots in Central Park. Because she was late, she feared Joshua would have given up waiting for her. Barely taking time to look both ways, she raced across Fifty-ninth Street. Her heart pounded in her throat as she approached the pond. Excitement filled her when she spied Joshua standing along the edge of the water, feeding the goldfish. Hannah half ran to meet him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry I\u2019m late,\u201d she said breathlessly when she joined him. \u201cIt took me much longer to get away than I thought it would.\u201d</p><p>Joshua glanced at her and enfolded her with a warm smile of welcome. \u201cI was feeding the fish, and didn\u2019t notice.\u201d He handed her a fistful of stale bread crumbs for her to toss onto the water\u2019s still surface. Huge goldfish, some marked with black-and-white blotches, battled for the crumbs, stirring up the water\u2019s smooth surface.</p><p>\u201cThis has always been one of my favorite places,\u201d Joshua said.</p><p>\u201cMine too,\u201d she admitted. It didn\u2019t surprise her that Joshua felt the same way about this place as she did. They appreciated many of the same things.</p><p>They stood side by side, content without speaking, satisfied simply to be in each other\u2019s company.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I need to tell you,\u201d Hannah said once she\u2019d regained her breath and her equilibrium. Being with Joshua always seemed to pull her off center.</p><p>Joshua hesitated, and his eyes sparkled. \u201cAm I going to need to sit down to hear it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. At least I don\u2019t think so.\u201d She thought about what she had to say and realized he was the last person she should be telling instead of the first. \u201cI\u2019ve decided not to marry Carl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Joshua tossed the last of the bread crumbs into the pond with a flourish.</p><p>Of all the reactions Hannah had expected from Joshua, she\u2019d never anticipated this calm acceptance. She frowned. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, I knew you weren\u2019t going to marry Carl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how could you be so confident of that?\u201d she asked. She hadn\u2019t realized it herself until the night before. Once she\u2019d admitted that she couldn\u2019t go through with the wedding, she\u2019d felt as though a great weight had been lifted from her heart. It hadn\u2019t been an easy decision, and she didn\u2019t want him to think she\u2019d made it flippantly.</p><p>\u201cI knew you weren\u2019t going to be marrying Carl, my sweet, adorable Hannah, for one simple reason. I fully intend for you to marry me.\u201d</p><p>Hannah blinked back her surprise.</p><p>\u201cAnd yes, if you\u2019re wondering, that\u2019s a marriage proposal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m already engaged to Carl,\u201d she argued, saying the first thing that came to mind. He\u2019d shocked her so thoroughly that she wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. The second thing that came to mind was that she would have liked nothing better than to be Joshua\u2019s wife. She was forced into biting her lips to keep from blurting it out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He warmed her with another of his bone-melting smiles. \u201cYou see, I realized something the very first time we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s simple, really,\u201d he said with the calm reasoning of an attorney. \u201cI realized you and I were meant to be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about Carl?\u201d she pleaded. \u201cI was already engaged to him when we met.\u201d While that wasn\u2019t technically true, for all intents and purposes she might as well have been betrothed to the rabbi\u2019s son. In the eyes of both families, all that needed to be decided was if they should or shouldn\u2019t hire a wedding coordinator.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose I sound overly confident of myself,\u201d Joshua said, and reached inside his coat pocket for his leather gloves. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure about any of this until recently, though. The night at Rockefeller Center, to be exact. I gave you my business card, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t phone you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he was gracious enough to agree, \u201cand I\u2019ll admit I haven\u2019t been sleeping well because I fully expected you to contact me long before now.\u201d He reached for her hand and raised it to his lips, brushing her knuckles with his mouth. \u201cYou and I share something very special, Hannah. I don\u2019t know what I would have done had you decided to go ahead with the wedding with Carl.\u201d</p><p>Hannah dipped her head. \u201cI haven\u2019t said anything to him yet.\u201d It was far easier to tell Joshua of her decision first. She realized she was behaving like a coward, but she sincerely felt that Carl would experience a deep sense of relief once she asked him to release her from the engagement. She was certain he shared her feelings. They were both eager to please their parents and had allowed themselves unwittingly to be drawn into a self-made trap.</p><p>Joshua loved her. The knowledge shook her because she didn\u2019t understand how anyone as powerful and intelligent as Joshua could care for someone like her. \u201cI\u2019ve treated you terribly. I\u2019ve ignored you, pretended I didn\u2019t know you, and shunned you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen something is of high value, then it\u2019s worth a few inconveniences,\u201d Joshua said, and gently bounced his mouth over hers. \u201cIn many ways I\u2019m grateful to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d almost given up thinking about God until I met you. My life was full and busy, but I felt an aching loneliness. I prayed, but I felt as if my prayers floated away to nothingness. Until the morning of the Thanksgiving Day parade, I was convinced God didn\u2019t listen to prayers any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut He does,\u201d Hannah insisted.</p><p>\u201cI know. He sent you into my life.\u201d Joshua ran his finger down the side of her face. \u201cYou\u2019ll be talking to Carl soon?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. It wasn\u2019t a task she relished, but it was one she couldn\u2019t delay. To wait for the right moment would only make it more difficult. \u201cI thought I\u2019d discuss it with him first, and then the two of us could explain it to our parents together.\u201d</p> <p>Joshua\u2019s gaze narrowed briefly, and she knew he wasn\u2019t keen on this part of her plan.</p><p>\u201cCarl and I need to present a united front,\u201d she explained. \u201cOtherwise I\u2019m afraid they\u2019ll manipulate us individually to change our minds.\u201d</p><p>Joshua considered her words, then asked, \u201cCould they change your mind, Hannah?\u201d</p><p>His question fell into a weighted silence. Hannah considered her answer for several thought-provoking moments. \u201cCarl\u2019s a good man, and he\u2019ll make some woman an excellent husband, but that woman won\u2019t be me,\u201d she admitted, then added, \u201cNothing\u2019s going to change the way I feel about you, Joshua. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll tell him soon, then?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThe sooner the better.\u201d She didn\u2019t relish this task, but she couldn\u2019t put it off, either.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to come with you?\u201d Joshua volunteered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d That would only make matters worse, Hannah realized. Her news would be difficult enough for Carl without adding the complication of her feelings for another man.</p> <p>Joshua looked at his watch. \u201cI have to get back to the office.\u201d</p><p>It was easy to forget that Joshua was an important man. If she ever doubted his feelings for her, all she\u2019d need to do was remember the time he took out of his busy schedule to be with her.</p><p>\u201cOne thing before you go?\u201d she asked, reaching out and gripping hold of his forearm.</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>She felt foolish asking this of him. \u201cWould you mind very much if we kissed again?\u201d</p><p>The warm light that invaded his eyes was all the answer she needed. Joshua wrapped her in his embrace and drugged her with a number of long, slow kisses.</p><p>\u201cIs that enough?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t manage anything more than a slight groan.</p><p>Joshua closed his eyes and inhaled deeply. \u201cUnfortunately I feel the same way myself. I promise you the day will come when we won\u2019t stop with the kissing, Hannah. Frankly the sooner that day arrives, the better.\u201d</p><p>Joshua left her to return to his office. The warm glow of his kisses carried Hannah all the way to Carl\u2019s apartment building. He should be home, seeing that school had been out for several hours. Hannah had been to his place only twice. Carl was an orderly man who kept his quarters meticulously clean. Hannah had never known anyone more gifted in the area of organization than Carl Rabinsky.</p><p>Not once on the long walk did Hannah doubt that she was doing the right thing. Only when she arrived at his building did she hesitate. Gathering her courage about her, she squared her shoulders and pressed the doorbell.</p><p>Carl\u2019s low voice came over the intercom. \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannah,\u201d she said, standing on her tiptoes and speaking directly into the intercom to make sure he could hear her.</p><p>\u201cHannah? My goodness, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to talk to you. Could I come up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>A couple of seconds later a buzzer rang and the lock on the front door released, allowing Hannah inside the building. More nervous now than ever, she took the elevator up to Carl\u2019s apartment. By the time she arrived outside his door, she was convinced her heart was ready to pound straight through her chest.</p><p>\u201cThis is a surprise,\u201d Carl said, leading her into the living room. The area was nothing like she remembered. Books and papers littered the table. Unopened mail was scattered across the coffee table. This wasn\u2019t like Carl. Not once in all the time she\u2019d known him had he displayed any signs of sloppiness.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Hannah asked, watching him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to try to hide it any longer,\u201d he said, sinking into the chair and covering his face with both hands. \u201cI should have told you sooner.\u201d</p><p>Hannah didn\u2019t know what to think. \u201cTold me what?\u201d she asked gently. She\u2019d never seen Carl like this.</p><p>He raised his head slowly, his look tortured. \u201cBut then I haven\u2019t found the courage to tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>Hannah waited, knowing Carl would get around to explaining himself eventually. He shifted uncomfortably in his chair and refused to look at her.</p><p>\u201cI lost my position with the school,\u201d he blurted out, then squeezed his eyes closed. \u201cI couldn\u2019t take it any longer, and I got into an argument with Hiram. Since he\u2019s the headmaster and I\u2019m nothing more than a teacher, he fired me.\u201d Carl raised his head and squared his shoulders. \u201cIf you want to call off the wedding, I\u2019ll understand. I don\u2019t deserve a good woman like you.\u201d</p><p>Brynn didn\u2019t tell anyone about the formal reprimand that Mr. Whalen had placed inside her employment file. There didn\u2019t seem to be any need. Everything he\u2019d said was true. She had stepped over the line, but try as she would, Brynn couldn\u2019t make herself regret the impromptu discussion with her students. If she\u2019d managed to reach just one member of her class, then it had been worth the trouble.</p><p>Her thoughts were heavy as she made her way home that afternoon. Dinner was simmering on top of the stove when her telephone rang. She reached for it automatically.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Roberto.\u201d</p><p>Brynn closed her eyes. The sound of his voice, with his soft, lilting accent, was like sinking neck deep into a warm bath in the dead of winter.</p><p>\u201cI heard you\u2019re teaching sex education now, too.\u201d He sounded more amused than angry with her, which was a welcome change.</p><p>\u201cI really stuck my foot in it this time,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cAlthough he probably wouldn\u2019t come out and say as much, I think Emilio was grateful to have someone talk frankly about the subject. Girls can be pushy these days. As pushy as the boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s true.\u201d After some of the things she\u2019d seen in the last few weeks, there was little that would shock Brynn anymore.</p><p>\u201cAlthough if you cared to get pushy with me, we might strike some agreement.\u201d</p><p>Brynn laughed. \u201cKeep dreaming, Roberto.\u201d</p><p>The mechanic\u2019s chuckle slowly faded. \u201cYou do that to me,\u201d he said, his voice low and serious. \u201cYou make me want to dream, but then I wonder . . . Never mind. I didn\u2019t call you to talk about dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to take you to dinner.\u201d His voice grew so serious that she wondered if there were some hidden significance behind his request.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d she asked, not that it would have mattered to her. He could have suggested next June and she would have agreed readily.</p><p>\u201cIs Friday all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said automatically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up at six-thirty.\u201d How formal he sounded, as though he were unsure of himself.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d The smile was back in his voice, as if to say now that the awkward part was over, he could go back to being himself. \u201cThank you, Brynn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever for?\u201d She was thinking his appreciation had something to do with what Emilio had told him about the class discussion.</p><p>\u201cFor agreeing to be my date.\u201d</p><p>Not until Brynn was talking to Father Grady did she realize the significance in Roberto\u2019s having asked her to dinner.</p><p>She met the parish priest after school, responding to a message he\u2019d sent asking to speak with her. She guessed correctly that Father Grady had heard about her talk with her students.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to lecture me about the error of my ways?\u201d she asked him directly. They were walking toward the rectory. Father Grady\u2019s hands were folded behind his back, and he avoided meeting her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said slowly, \u201calthough I fully suspect you know the church\u2019s teachings in the area of birth control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I just don\u2019t happen to agree.\u201d</p><p>Father Grady released a long, slow breath. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say anything about this again, but I\u2019m disappointed in you, Brynn. I don\u2019t know what happened for you to decide it was your duty to discuss this particular subject with your class, but my guess is this entire matter was spontaneous on your part. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI strongly suspect one of the girls is pregnant.

She didn\u2019t want to get into a verbal battle with the one person she considered her friend.</p> <p>They didn\u2019t speak for several moments.</p><p>\u201cRoberto asked me to dinner Friday night,\u201d Brynn said, wanting to break the tension between them.</p><p>Father Grady\u2019s face broke into a wide smile. \u201cHe asked you, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there something important about this dinner date I don\u2019t know about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly,\u201d the priest informed her, \u201conly that it\u2019s probably the first time Roberto\u2019s dated in the last four or five years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. While he was in high school, he held down two part-time jobs in an effort to earn enough money for his mother to travel to the United States. Every penny went toward that goal. There wasn\u2019t time for dances or anything else a normal teenager enjoys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s an excellent dancer.\u201d Being in his arms had seemed as right as rain, as the saying went.</p><p>\u201cHe comes by that talent naturally,\u201d Father Grady explained. \u201cBut he\u2019s never taken the opportunity to indulge in the small pleasures in life. He sacrificed his youth for the sake of his mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never met her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d Father Grady said sadly. \u201cShe died before Roberto had saved enough money.\u201d</p> <p>Brynn felt Roberto\u2019s frustration. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoberto blamed himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how could he?\u201d She hated the thought of his taking on blame when he\u2019d already sacrificed so much.</p><p>\u201cHe seemed to think that he\u2019d failed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely he understands that isn\u2019t the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntellectually I believe he does, but not emotionally, although I have hope now that he\u2019s taken such a keen interest in you.\u201d Father looked well pleased with himself, as though he were the one responsible for bringing her and Roberto together. \u201cYou\u2019ve been good for that young man, but by the same token Roberto has been good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like him so much,\u201d she whispered. Sometimes it frightened her how deeply she cared for Roberto. He wasn\u2019t like any other man she\u2019d dated. He was deep and intense, intelligent and generous.</p><p>\u201cI suspected you did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot at first,\u201d she countered. \u201cRoberto and I rubbed each other the wrong way in the beginning.\u201d Even now they were at different poles on the subject of education. No matter how hard she tried to persuade him, Roberto refused to listen to reason.</p><p>Then it dawned on her why Roberto was so opinionated. Father Grady had unraveled the mystery. Roberto had stayed in school and worked, saving his money in order to bring his mother from Mexico. She\u2019d died before he had been able to save enough. If Roberto had been working full-time instead of trying to balance two part-time jobs with his schooling, he might have been able to help his mother. Because he\u2019d stayed in high school the help he had to offer her had come too late.</p><p>Twelve</p><p>Emilio followed Roberto around the apartment like a lost puppy, offering him unwanted advice for his dinner date with Brynn.</p><p>\u201cFirst you\u2019ve got to tell Miss Cassidy how beautiful she looks,\u201d Emilio instructed, \u201cthen gently take her in your arms and kiss her, but only lightly. Remember that, because it\u2019s important. You don\u2019t want to start something too soon. Women don\u2019t like a guy coming on heavy first thing. They want to be wined and dined first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmilio,\u201d Roberto warned under his breath as he tightened the knot in his tie in front of the bedroom mirror, \u201cI can handle this on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I know Miss Cassidy better than you do. Don\u2019t forget I see her practically every day.\u201d</p><p>But his brother didn\u2019t view her as Roberto did. To Emilio she was his teacher, the first one he\u2019d liked well enough to mention. To Roberto Brynn was a warm, desirable, generous woman. When they kissed the electricity between them was as powerful as Hoover Dam.</p><p>In the beginning he\u2019d attempted to ignore the way the air sizzled every time they were together. A touch of antagonism had proved to be his best defense, and it had worked until Father Grady had manipulated them into chaperoning the dance at the church hall. Before he knew what had happened to him, Brynn was in his arms and life hadn\u2019t been the same since.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking her to dinner?\u201d Emilio asked, following him across the bedroom.</p><p>Roberto splashed on a touch of spice-scented cologne. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d Actually he had, but he didn\u2019t want his brother dropping by unexpectedly with some phony excuse.</p><p>Emilio frowned with disapproval. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to work, bro, you\u2019ve got to plan these things well in advance. You should have made reservations for a classy woman like Miss Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>If the truth be known, Emilio\u2019s attitude toward Brynn amused him. The way Emilio talked about her, one would think his brother was half in love with her himself.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just walk into any restaurant and expect a decent table to be waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Roberto reached for his wool jacket. He hoped Brynn didn\u2019t recognize it as the same one from the dance. He owned only one suit, and he wasn\u2019t about to go out and purchase another just because of a silly dinner date.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know all this?\u201d Roberto probed.</p><p>\u201cI been around,\u201d Emilio answered with a hint of defiance.</p><p>That might be true, but Roberto didn\u2019t think Emilio had ever taken a girl out on a fancy dinner date.</p><p>\u201cYou got her flowers, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Roberto hadn\u2019t thought of that. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d he said, shaking his head, \u201cyou\u2019re going to blow this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick some up on the way.\u201d</p><p>Emilio\u2019s face relaxed. \u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>Roberto headed for the door, then stopped for his overcoat and gloves. The leather gloves were new and necessary to hide the car grease he couldn\u2019t remove from around his nails.</p><p>Once more Emilio followed him. \u201cI know the perfect restaurant,\u201d he said excitedly, and snapped his fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect. Call Mama Celeste\u2019s and make a reservation. The food\u2019s great and they think you walk on water ever since you repaired their van.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d Unfortunately that was exactly where Roberto had already planned to take Brynn. He turned and met his brother, eye to eye. He couldn\u2019t remember when Emilio had grown so tall. Nearly ten years separated them, and Roberto had become accustomed to being the older, wiser, bigger brother. He wasn\u2019t taller by much, and that surprised him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already made arrangements to take Brynn to Mama Celeste\u2019s,\u201d he admitted. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want you making any excuses to stop by there this evening. Do I make myself clear?\u201d</p><p>One corner of Emilio\u2019s mouth lifted with a cocky half smile. \u201cWhat\u2019s it worth to you?\u201d</p><p>Roberto eyes narrowed into a dark scowl, and Emilio laughed. \u201cHey, I was just kidding, bro.\u201d</p><p>Roberto opened the front door. \u201cDon\u2019t wait up for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding, man? This is one night I\u2019m going to want to hear about.\u201d</p><p>Brynn had been less nervous for her first high school prom. She checked her appearance a dozen or more times before the doorbell rang. Her inclination was to rush across the room and throw open the door, but she forced herself to remain calm and collected.</p><p>Roberto stood on the other side of the door, so handsome her breath locked in her lungs. It reminded her of the night of the church dance. He\u2019d knocked her senses for a loop then, too.</p><p>Looking away, she stepped aside to allow him into her apartment. \u201cHello, Roberto.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head slightly. \u201cYou look lovely.\u201d Smiling, he stepped into her apartment and tenderly pressed his lips to her cheek.</p><p>Surprised and delighted, Brynn raised her hand to her face, her fingers investigating the spot where he\u2019d kissed her.</p><p>Next he presented her with a small bouquet of flowers.</p><p>\u201cRoberto, how sweet. Thank you.\u201d She led the way into the kitchen, where she placed the bouquet of pink carnations and miniature purple irises in a tall crystal vase.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think to buy any wine,\u201d she said, regretting now that she hadn\u2019t thought of that beforehand.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have wine later,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll only be a minute,\u201d she said, and gestured self-consciously toward the bedroom. \u201cI need to get my coat.\u201d</p><p>The ride to the restaurant, an Italian one from the looks of it, took several minutes. Roberto, the perfect gentleman, helped her out of the car and then escorted her inside.</p><p>The moment she walked through the door, Brynn was greeted with the scents of basil and simmering tomato. Garlic permeated the air, and she inhaled deeply, the smell alone enough to make her hungry. No one needed to tell her how good the food would be.</p><p>Roberto apparently knew the owners, and standing with his arm tucked around her waist, he introduced her.</p><p>\u201cBrynn Cassidy, meet Stefano and Celeste Seti.\u201d</p><p>She shook hands with the white-haired gentleman who was smiling broadly. His wife, Mama Celeste herself, planted her hands on her face and mumbled something in Italian to her husband. Brynn couldn\u2019t understand a word. Whatever it was appeared to please the grandmotherly woman. With a wide smile she kissed Roberto on both cheeks and promised them, in heavily accented English, the best dinner of their lives.</p><p>Soon they were seated at a table. Before Brynn had a chance to smooth the linen napkin on her lap, she was served red wine, thick slices of bread, and a large block of cheese.</p><p>The food never seemed to stop coming. Brynn sampled one fabulous dish after another. There must have been three or four different appetizers\u2014shrimp, eggplant, tiny meatballs\u2014before a huge Caesar salad arrived. When Brynn was convinced she couldn\u2019t eat another bite, the pasta was brought to their table by Stefano, who insisted she would break Celeste\u2019s heart if she didn\u2019t take a large portion of the specialty of the house. From the envious looks being sent her way, Brynn had the feeling if she couldn\u2019t finish the clam spaghetti, any number of volunteers would gladly step in for her.</p><p>\u201cMore wine, more wine,\u201d Stefano insisted, replenishing their glasses when she\u2019d finished the best pasta she\u2019d ever tasted. Brynn wasn\u2019t given a chance to refuse the wine. Stefano filled her glass and carried away their empty plates.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had such good food in my life,\u201d she murmured, and scooted back her chair. She planted her hands on her stomach. \u201cBut if I don\u2019t stop eating now, I won\u2019t be able to walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo dessert?\u201d Roberto teased.</p><p>They finished with a cup of dark coffee. Stefano and Celeste visited their table before they left, and this time it was Brynn who was hugged and kissed. Mama\u2019s eyes watered, and she dabbed at their corners with the hem of her apron. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once they were outside, Roberto headed for the car.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind very much if we walked awhile?\u201d Brynn asked. Physical movement would help ease the stuffed feeling. Besides, she didn\u2019t want the evening to end so soon.</p><p>\u201cBy all means, let\u2019s walk,\u201d Roberto agreed. He reached for her hand and set a slow, easy pace. The night was crisp and cold.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like it might snow.\u201d</p> <p>Roberto glanced skyward. \u201cWishful thinking on your part,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThere\u2019s barely a cloud in the sky.\u201d</p><p>He was right. The image of them walking together, hand in hand through lightly falling snow, appealed to her.</p><p>Although she\u2019d enjoyed their dinner, her one regret was that with all the food being served, and Stefano checking to be sure everything was to their liking, there hadn\u2019t been much of a chance for the two of them to talk.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Roberto, for a wonderful meal.\u201d</p><p>He released her hand and slipped his arm around her waist. \u201cThank you for coming with me.\u201d</p> <p>Brynn pressed her head against his shoulder. \u201cWhat made you decide to ask me out?\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure what prompted the question, but she was curious.</p><p>\u201cI wanted everything to be right for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe right?\u201d</p><p>He exhaled slowly as though he weren\u2019t sure how to explain himself. \u201cYou aren\u2019t like other women I\u2019ve known.\u201d</p><p>Brynn smiled to herself. \u201cIs that a compliment?\u201d</p><p>Roberto was taken aback by her question. \u201cI meant it to be. Have I insulted you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re special, Brynn. Not only to me, but to Emilio and his friends, too. They think a lot of you. I\u2019ve heard the teens talk about you, and when they do, well, it\u2019s with respect. It takes a lot to impress kids these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you feel about me?\u201d she asked. It would be far easier for her if Roberto came right out and told her. She\u2019d never been so bold with a man, but this wasn\u2019t a normal relationship.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d He hesitated, taking some time to formulate his thoughts. \u201cYou\u2019re stubborn and strong-willed.\u201d</p><p>Brynn wouldn\u2019t deny it. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m stubborn, you should meet my mother.\u201d She bit down on her lip when she realized what she\u2019d said. Reminding him of the mother he\u2019d lost was the last thing she wanted.</p><p>\u201cSo you inherited the trait.\u201d He sounded amused, and Brynn was relieved.</p><p>\u201cI care for you, Roberto,\u201d she told him softly. \u201cMore than I care for anyone other than my family.\u201d If he wasn\u2019t willing to acknowledge his feelings for her, then she\u2019d be the first one to say it. \u201cKnowing you has blessed my life. When I have a problem, you\u2019re the person I want to share it with. When something good happens, you\u2019re the one I want to tell. I find myself thinking about you a lot, probably more than I should.\u201d</p><p>His arm tightened around her middle. \u201cI feel the same way about you. I want very much to kiss you, Brynn,\u201d he said with a deep sigh that revealed his longing for her, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to do it in public. Not again. I\u2019ll wait until we get back to your apartment.\u201d</p> <p>Brynn\u2019s heart swelled with emotion as she looked to him. \u201cWe could leave now, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Roberto chuckled, and together they raced across the street and back to Mama Celeste\u2019s, where Roberto\u2019s car was parked.</p><p>As they neared Brynn\u2019s apartment their amusement ebbed, replaced with a growing anticipation. Brynn\u2019s hand shook slightly as she unlocked the front door, knowing that soon she would be in Roberto\u2019s arms.</p><p>Together they walked into her apartment. Brynn didn\u2019t bother to turn on the lights. Once the door was closed, she lifted her arms and reached for Roberto.</p><p>With a deep-seated groan, he backed her against the door and kissed her.</p><p>The kiss was like fire, a spontaneous combustion of desire and need. Once wasn\u2019t near enough to satisfy either of them, and Roberto kissed her again and again. He surprised her with his tongue, and she gasped as he thrust it deep inside her mouth, stroking and teasing her. Gradually her gasp became a whimper that trembled from her lips.</p><p>When she was sure they were both about to faint with the intensity of their lovemaking, Roberto pulled away. She noted that his chest was heaving; hers was, too. In the dim light he looked down on her, and she met his look recklessly, unafraid for him to see all the love and longing in her eyes. Her fingers clung to the lapels of his suit as she studied him.</p><p>She waited, needing to know he\u2019d experienced the same wonder she had. He closed his eyes momentarily, his breath deep and harsh, as though he needed to separate himself from her, if not physically, then emotionally.</p><p>Brynn might have been offended if he hadn\u2019t continued to hold her close and with such tender care. She pressed her head to his chest and listened to the strong, fast-paced beat of his heart.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t dare touch you again,\u201d he whispered thickly.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me lose my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bad?\u201d she asked.</p><p>She felt his smile against her cheek. \u201cNot exactly. It would be very easy to take you into that bedroom and make love to you, but I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t?\u201d She couldn\u2019t believe she was asking him this.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t allow that to happen. Once would never be enough with you. I would want you again and again, and that would only lead to\u2014\u201d</p><p>A loud knock sounded against the door, startling them both. Roberto\u2019s eyes met hers in the faded light. \u201cYou\u2019re expecting someone?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d she asked, struggling to make her voice strong enough to be heard.</p><p>Roberto turned on the light switch.</p><p>\u201cEmilio,\u201d Roberto\u2019s brother shouted from the other side.</p><p>Roberto stiffened with irritation and opened the front door.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Modesto,\u201d Emilio cried as he stumbled into the apartment. His eyes were wide with panic and fear. The teenager slumped onto the sofa and covered his face with both hands. \u201cModesto\u2019s been shot.\u201d</p><p>Jammed inside Jenny and Michelle\u2019s dinky apartment for the potluck Christmas party, everyone seemed to be talking at once. Trey felt as out of place as a bull moose at one of those fancy dog shows, the ones with dolled-up poodles with painted toenails.</p><p>Jenny\u2019s acting friends were certainly a mixed breed. There were everyday people, the kind he would have been hard-pressed to guess were show people, and then there were the others. The others, he noted, tended to be flamboyant attention seekers.</p><p>It made for an interesting evening, he would admit that much. Holding his drink, he found a quiet corner and played the role of casual observer.</p><p>A couple of times Jenny drifted his way, but she wasn\u2019t able to stay for long. Trey understood. Since she shared hostessing duties with her roommate, she couldn\u2019t very well give him all her attention. Though to be honest, that was what Trey would have preferred.</p><p>He sipped the wine, a fruity-flavored one he wouldn\u2019t normally drink, but was all the market had offered. He found himself watching Jenny, mesmerized by her. She was as beautiful as he remembered, more so. Yet he couldn\u2019t look at her without his gut twisting up in a knot. This had been his lot when she was growing up. Loving her from afar.</p><p>Next to burying his parents, the most difficult thing Trey had ever done was to let Jenny Lancaster leave Custer, Montana, without telling her how much he loved her. He hadn\u2019t felt particularly self-sacrificing and noble at the time. He didn\u2019t feel that way now. It was just that he had some decisions to make, damned important ones, and they involved Jenny.</p><p>He loved her, and although he\u2019d tried to forget her in the last three years, he couldn\u2019t. Countless times he\u2019d attempted to convince himself to look for greener pastures.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t worked.</p><p>He\u2019d spent the better part of ten years in love with Jenny, and it didn\u2019t appear that time or distance was going to change the way he felt.</p><p>She\u2019d been little more than fifteen when he\u2019d first recognized her as a woman. Until then she\u2019d been a pesky kid. Living next door, so to speak, Trey had dealt mostly with Dillon, Jenny\u2019s father.</p><p>He remembered the day he\u2019d realized she was a woman. He\u2019d driven over to talk to her father about one thing or another and gone into the barn. Jenny had been there, grooming her filly and practicing her lines for a school play, when he\u2019d stumbled upon her by accident. Without missing a beat, she\u2019d continued with a flawless delivery. She\u2019d ended her soliloquy by dramatically throwing herself into his arms, then leaning back and planting the back of her hand against her forehead. Less than a second passed before she\u2019d recovered from her death, leaped upright, and asked him what he\u2019d thought of her performance.</p><p>What he\u2019d saw, Trey realized now, was the most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever laid eyes on. Until that moment Trey had thought of Jenny as a kid. But it hadn\u2019t been a child he\u2019d held in those few moments.</p><p>Trey had scowled and muttered something about needing to talk to Dillon. Then for the next several years he\u2019d waited impatiently for Jenny to grow up so he could court her. Three long, torturous years. It hadn\u2019t been easy watching her date one young buck after another. Nor had he liked her riding over to tell him about her dates and seeking his advice.</p><p>Trey suspected Jenny\u2019s parents knew how he felt about their daughter. But if they did, neither one said anything to him, and for that he was grateful.</p><p>By the time Jenny entered community college, she was dating one particular young man, and it looked for a time as if the two of them might be growing serious. More than once Trey had thought to go to her with his heart on his sleeve and tell her the way he felt.</p><p>This happened shortly after his parents had died, one after the other, within a nine-month period, and he was struggling financially. Dealing with his family\u2019s estate had drained his ready cash. Unfortunately this was about the same time that beef prices had plummeted. While he was fighting off the banks and barely holding his head above water financially wasn\u2019t the time to be asking a woman to be his wife.</p><p>By the time he felt he had something to offer Jenny, she\u2019d made the decision to leave Montana for New York.</p><p>Trey remembered that Jenny\u2019s family had thrown a big going-away party for her. Trey couldn\u2019t force himself to attend. He knew if he let her leave, there was a good chance he\u2019d never see her again, at least not the Jenny he knew. New York would change her. New York would make her into one of those sophisticated women who carried their dogs under their arms while they went clothes shopping.</p><p>Letting Jenny leave Montana was a testament of how much he loved her. His love couldn\u2019t compete with her dreams. The bright lights of Broadway was her destiny. He was a cattle rancher with damn little to offer someone as talented as Jenny Lancaster.</p><p>At the last minute, Trey had stopped by the ranch and managed to wish her his very best. He remembered he\u2019d said something corny about her breaking her leg in New York. Then he\u2019d stood with her family and waved good-bye. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d driven off with her friends and taken his heart with her.</p><p>Afterward, Trey had gone home and gotten soundly drunk.</p><p>The first year after she\u2019d left had been the worst. He\u2019d made a dozen or more excuses to visit the Lancasters and ask about her. He\u2019d been tempted to write her but had promised himself he wouldn\u2019t. She was out of his life now and would soon be a big shot on Broadway.</p><p>Only it hadn\u2019t happened quite like that. By the second Christmas she was away, he\u2019d been semisuccessful in pushing the memory of her to the back of his mind. He still asked about her occasionally and was surprised to learn that her name wasn\u2019t lighting up any marquees. It was then that he\u2019d begun to hope Jenny would throw in the towel and move home to lick her wounds.</p> <p>It was the small quiver in her voice when he\u2019d phoned that had first alerted Trey to the fact that something was wrong. He hadn\u2019t been able to put his finger on it. After all this time, he didn\u2019t expect Jenny to be the same person she\u2019d been when she\u2019d left Custer. He wasn\u2019t sure now what he had expected. Instead of sounding happy, she\u2019d seemed sad, and he\u2019d sensed in her a deep pain she couldn\u2019t hide.</p><p>He\u2019d mulled that over for a number of days, and then it seemed everyone he knew on God\u2019s green earth started talking about New York. Before he could question the wisdom of his actions, he\u2019d booked the flight to New York and subsequently learned the truth. He wasn\u2019t relieved or glad at her lack of success. His first reaction had been anger that those fancy, worldly men had been blind to her talents.</p><p>Trey wanted to take Jenny back to Montana. He wanted to love her, comfort her, and take care of her. More than that, he wanted to wipe away the frustration and disappointment.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t meant to ask her to come home so abruptly, but the words had refused to remain unsaid. The first time he\u2019d asked, her response had been quick and sharp.</p><p>No.</p> <p>That had been before he\u2019d kissed her. When he\u2019d asked a second time, she hadn\u2019t answered.</p><p>Someone slipped a tape inside the cassette player, and a fresh batch of Christmas music filled the room. Several started to sing, and soon Trey heard three distinct parts, blending in perfect harmony.</p><p>Within a few moments everyone had stopped chatting to sing along. Jenny drifted over to Trey\u2019s side. He\u2019d never tire of hearing her sing. This, he decided, was what angels must sound like. Her voice conjured up that image for him.</p><p>The old Christmas carols were his personal favorites, and when the first introductory notes of \u201cSilent Night\u201d played, Trey sang along himself. It surprised him how well his deep voice blended with Jenny\u2019s.</p><p>Pleasure lit up her eyes when she turned to smile at him.</p><p>He returned the gesture and draped his arm around her shoulder. A couple of the men in the group glanced his way and frowned. Trey didn\u2019t blame them for being jealous. He had battled down the affliction every time Jenny so much as glanced at another man. In the beginning it had damn near eaten him alive, but time and effort had helped him master his feelings.</p> <p>Soon the music faded, taken over with small talk. The crowd was beginning to get to him, so he decided to step outside for some fresh air. To his surprise, Jenny grabbed her coat and followed him.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d she said, and led him to the fire escape. She sat down and patted the space next to her. \u201cI used to sit out here in the hottest nights of summer,\u201d she said. Her breath produced clouded puffs in the cold night air. \u201cOut here with the sky bright with stars was as close as I could get to feeling like I was in Montana again,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>It was hard for Trey to hold his tongue. He\u2019d already asked her twice to come back to Custer with him. He wouldn\u2019t do it again.</p><p>\u201cI wondered if you ever thought about home,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cEvery day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you think about me, Jenny?\u201d He braced himself, fearing he wouldn\u2019t like her answer. He had never said a solitary word about his feelings for her.</p><p>When she looked up at him, Trey noticed that her eyes were bright with unshed tears. \u201cI thought about you a lot, Trey. I don\u2019t know why, but in the last six months it seemed you were on my mind nearly every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never wrote me,\u201d he reminded her.</p> <p>Her smile was weak at best. \u201cYou didn\u2019t write me, either.\u201d</p><p>That he couldn\u2019t argue with.</p><p>\u201cDid you . . . did you think about me, Trey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery damn minute of every damn day you\u2019ve been away,\u201d he admitted huskily. He kissed her then, simply because he needed her so badly. He\u2019d loved her for so long, he didn\u2019t know what it was not to love her.</p><p>Her ready response left him lightheaded. The kiss went on and on until they were both desperate to breathe.</p><p>\u201cOh, Trey,\u201d she whispered, and buried her face against his neck.</p><p>It was heaven to hold her and the purest form of torture he had ever experienced. Heaven and hell.</p><p>The door abruptly opened behind them, and a couple stumbled out, giggling.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d the male voice charged. \u201cWe haven\u2019t interrupted anything, have we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cModesto\u2019s been shot.\u201d Shirley landed on the fire escape with such an urgency that she nearly unseated Mercy.</p><p>\u201cMy goodness,\u201d Mercy said, gasping.</p><p>\u201cDid someone call for me?\u201d Goodness asked, joining her two friends.</p><p>\u201cModesto\u2019s in the hospital,\u201d Shirley blurted out in a dither. \u201cIt was a gang shooting . . . someone he didn\u2019t even know. We\u2019ve got to get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Brynn?\u201d Mercy asked, following her friend.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s already at New York General with Roberto and his brother. Emilio\u2019s in a bad way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my.\u201d</p><p>Together the three of them left Jenny and headed across town. They soon descended into the hospital waiting room where the situation was tense.</p><p>Emilio sat in the corner of the room, bent forward, his elbows braced against his knees. Shirley couldn\u2019t remember ever seeing the teenager look more stricken. Roberto sat next to his brother, and Brynn couldn\u2019t seem to hold still. She paced from one side of the room to the other.</p><p>Modesto\u2019s mother was weeping softly. His older sister had her arm around their mother, but she looked as though she were about to break into tears herself.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been waiting two hours,\u201d Shirley informed her friends.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s taking so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cModesto\u2019s in surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did something like this happen?\u201d Mercy asked. In all the time they\u2019d been working together, they\u2019d never been a part of this kind of tragedy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do for them.\u201d Shirley turned to face her two friends. Always before she\u2019d been the one with the most experience and the one the other two had looked up to for help. She looked desperately to Goodness for help.</p><p>\u201cThis is just terrible,\u201d Mercy murmured, wringing her hands. \u201cJust terrible. Poor Modesto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Brynn.\u201d Shirley stood near the young teacher and watched her pace. \u201cShe\u2019s nearly beside herself with worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStand with her,\u201d Goodness urged. \u201cGive her your strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine?\u201d Shirley was beside herself. Never had she felt more inadequate. \u201cGabriel was right. I don\u2019t have nearly enough experience to help Brynn the way I should. She needs me and I\u2019ve failed her.\u201d</p><p>Brynn collapsed into a chair, and Shirley sat next to her and folded her wing protectively over the young woman.</p><p>\u201cStay with her,\u201d Goodness suggested. \u201cI\u2019m going to find out what I can about Modesto\u2019s condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Mercy said, joining Goodness. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about a thing,\u201d she said, looking back at Shirley. \u201cI\u2019m sure everything\u2019s under control.\u201d</p><p>The last thing Shirley wanted was to be left alone. She ached the same way Brynn did, worried the same way Brynn did. She shared her charge\u2019s feelings of inadequacy. If ever Gabriel was right, it was now.</p><p>\u201cShirley.\u201d</p><p>Just thinking about him seemed to have conjured up the archangel.</p><p>\u201cGabriel,\u201d she said, leaping to attention.</p><p>\u201cHow are things going?\u201d His presence seemed to fill up the hospital waiting room.</p><p>Shirley thought briefly of bluffing her way out of this, then figured Gabriel would be able to see through her in less time than it took for a heart to beat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about Modesto,\u201d she explained, distraught and near tears herself.</p><p>\u201cI know all about the boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me what\u2019s going to happen to him?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel inclined his head slightly. \u201cHe\u2019ll recover in time.\u201d</p><p>Shirley sighed with heartfelt relief. \u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll mention it the next time we talk,\u201d Gabriel assured her.</p><p>Sheepishly Shirley looked to the mighty archangel. \u201cYou were right,\u201d she admitted sadly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s always nice to know, but exactly what am I right about this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe helping Brynn. She\u2019s falling in love with Roberto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I understand.\u201d</p><p>Shirley waited for Gabriel to voice his disapproval, but he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cMr. Whalen placed a formal reprimand in her file.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard about that as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuzie\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s one giant mess, and it\u2019s all my fault.\u201d She hung her head, not wanting to view the disappointment in Gabriel\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cYour fault?\u201d Gabriel echoed, then chuckled softly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it all wrong.\u201d Gently he placed his wings around Shirley\u2019s burdened shoulders. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more proud had I trained you myself.\u201d He paused and sighed deeply. \u201cCome to think of it, I have.\u201d</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Hannah returned home from an errand her mother had sent her on, and hurried up the stairs to her family\u2019s living quarters. She hadn\u2019t taken more than a few steps into their apartment when aunts, uncles, cousins, and her beloved grandmother shouted, \u201cSurprise!\u201d</p><p>Hannah blinked back her shock. She stared at the sea of faces and noticed Carl\u2019s parents were present as well. Ruth rushed forward and hugged Hannah enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an engagement party,\u201d her mother announced when Hannah stared at her, unable to disguise her anxiety.</p><p>Hannah looked at Carl, who was thrust into the middle of the room with her. She hadn\u2019t seen him since he\u2019d confessed that he\u2019d been fired.</p><p>Admitting to his family that he\u2019d lost his job would have mortified Carl. Hannah might never have learned the truth had she not arrived unexpectedly on his doorstep the afternoon she\u2019d met Joshua.</p><p>When she recognized how troubled Carl was over the loss of his job, she knew she couldn\u2019t deliver even more depressing news. So she\u2019d been forced to bide her time.</p><p>\u201cApparently this party is in our honor,\u201d Carl explained.</p><p>Somehow Hannah managed to return a smile, but she didn\u2019t know how she would possibly make it through this party. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To be fair, Carl didn\u2019t look any more pleased than she did with the unexpectedness of their engagement party. He had told her earlier that since he was no longer employed, they would need to postpone the wedding. The next step was to announce this to their families. Carl had wanted time to tell his parents first, and Hannah had agreed. Now they were being forced to pretend all was well when they were keenly aware that it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Once the pressure was off to set a wedding date, Hannah would be free to tell Carl about having met Joshua. He would understand. She was sure of that.</p><p>Hannah glanced around the room. It was filled to capacity with family, aunts, uncles, cousins, and longtime friends who\u2019d come to wish her and Carl happiness.</p><p>Because it was expected of her, Hannah took Carl around and introduced him to her relatives.</p> <p>Her grandmother gazed at her fondly from a position of honor, the recliner. Hannah had always felt close to Sylvia Morganstern. Surely she would know something was wrong. Surely her grandmother would recognize that she wasn\u2019t in love with Carl. Hannah realized she wouldn\u2019t be able to hide her feelings from the one who\u2019d known and loved her all her life.</p><p>\u201cCome and say hello to your aunt Edith,\u201d Ruth said, placing her arm around Hannah\u2019s waist and leading her across the room.</p><p>Carl traipsed behind obediently. Hannah didn\u2019t know how anyone could look at the two of them and believe they were in love. Nor did she know how she could continue to pretend to be an eager bride when she intended to break their engagement at the earliest possible moment.</p><p>Briefly she closed her eyes and hoped Joshua would never learn of this engagement party. Thus far he\u2019d been wonderfully patient with her, but she didn\u2019t know how long that would last, especially when he learned she hadn\u2019t broken off the engagement with Carl the way she\u2019d promised.</p><p>\u201cHannah, my dear,\u201d her grandmother said, and patted the empty seat beside her. \u201cFirst introduce me to your young man and then sit down. I\u2019m going to be greedy and hog you all to myself for a few moments.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCarl, this is my grandma Morganstern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so pleased to meet you,\u201d Carl said formally and with deep respect.</p><p>Her grandmother asked him a number of gentle questions, which he answered, although it was clear to Hannah that he was eager to escape. Before he left, he was kind enough to bring Hannah and Sylvia each a cup of punch. Then as quickly as he could, he wandered away.</p><p>Her grandmother reached for Hannah\u2019s hand and squeezed her slim fingers affectionately. \u201cNow tell me all about you and Carl. How long have you been dating? How\u2019d you meet?\u201d</p><p>It demanded all the fortitude Hannah possessed to keep from blurting out the truth. If anyone would understand about her loving Joshua, it would be her grandmother.</p><p>\u201cHe looks like a good man.\u201d</p> <p>Hannah smiled and agreed. \u201cHe\u2019ll be a good husband.\u201d But not to her. She glanced in Carl\u2019s direction and found she could barely look at him and not experience a crushing sense of guilt.</p><p>\u201cHannah?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze continued to follow the man she\u2019d promised to marry. It astonished her that she could ever have agreed to be Carl\u2019s wife, especially when it was so painfully obvious they were mismatched.</p><p>\u201cCarl is a wonderful man. He\u2019s loyal and dedicated.\u201d Hannah lowered her gaze, hoping her grandmother wouldn\u2019t guess the love she nurtured in her heart was for another man.</p><p>Everyone seemed to be having a wonderful time. Together Hannah\u2019s parents brought one food tray after another out from the kitchen. The buffet-style meal was set on the dining room table. Because her parents were in the food business, this had been a labor of love, and the spread was something to behold.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken enough of your time,\u201d Sylvia insisted, patting Hannah\u2019s hand. \u201cIt looks like your mother\u2019s ready for you and Carl.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t escape Hannah\u2019s notice that her grandmother didn\u2019t comment on what a nice couple Hannah and Carl made. She was deeply relieved Sylvia hadn\u2019t pressed her with more questions. It was difficult enough to deceive her mother and father, but nearly impossible to maintain the pretense in front of her grandmother.</p><p>Hannah joined Carl, and it seemed everyone was staring at them, waiting for something to happen.</p> <p>Carl reached for her hand and whispered, \u201cI spoke to my father.\u201d</p><p>A sense of relief nearly swallowed her whole, and she turned to face him. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>Carl\u2019s gaze shifted about the room. \u201cHe\u2019s going to talk to the school board as soon as possible and see what can be done. I\u2019m confident he\u2019ll be able to straighten everything out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, Carl.\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened over hers. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how worried I\u2019ve been over this.\u201d</p><p>Hannah had been concerned as well, but not for the reasons Carl assumed.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s going to work out, Hannah, I promise you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it will.\u201d And as soon as Carl\u2019s misunderstanding with the headmaster was cleared up, she\u2019d be free to break the engagement.</p><p>Hannah\u2019s father asked Carl\u2019s father, Rabbi Rabinsky, to say a short prayer before they ate. The rabbi stepped forward and placed one hand on his son\u2019s shoulder and the other on Hannah\u2019s. He closed his eyes, and the room went still.</p><p>The prayer was short and potent, asking God to shower His love upon the two of them and to fill their lives with good things.</p><p>When he raised his head, there was a murmur of agreement. Her family loved her, Hannah realized, and they wished her and Carl much happiness.</p><p>Soon her relatives and other guests were busy filling their plates. Hannah wasn\u2019t the least bit hungry, but to not eat might have alerted her mother that something was wrong, so she dished up with the others.</p><p>Hannah and Carl were ushered to the seats of honor, and she noticed that he didn\u2019t seem to have much of an appetite himself.</p><p>The party sat in a large circle, their plates resting on their laps. It was Aunt Edith who asked the question first.</p><p>\u201cWell, you two, don\u2019t keep me in suspense any longer. When\u2019s the wedding date?\u201d</p><p>Everyone seemed to wait for Hannah to answer. The room filled with an expectant silence. Hannah looked first to her mother for help and then to Carl. Neither seemed inclined to respond.</p><p>\u201cI believe Mother and Helen felt that the wedding coordinator should be the one to decide that,\u201d Hannah explained when no one came to her rescue.</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Edith said, dismissing the idea with a wave of her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the two of you to set the date. Let the wedding coordinator work around the one you\u2019ve chosen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Hannah wasn\u2019t allowed to finish.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Cousin Hariette intoned. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to have an outsider make all the arrangements, then it\u2019s vital they know from the first who\u2019s in change. A wedding\u2019s no small thing, and it\u2019s best to get started on the right foot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wondered about this,\u201d Hannah\u2019s father murmured, looking to Ruth.</p><p>\u201cSpringtime,\u201d Edith suggested next. \u201cWhen the flowers are starting to bloom. There\u2019s nothing like fresh flowers for a wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Hannah said quickly. \u201cWe can\u2019t possibly have the wedding so soon . . . there wouldn\u2019t be near enough time, would there?\u201d She looked to Carl for support.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid Hannah\u2019s right,\u201d her mother concurred. \u201cWe were thinking June.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJune,\u201d Edith repeated. \u201cJune would be perfect.\u201d</p><p>Cousin Hariette brought out a new calendar and flipped through the pages until she located the month.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Carl and I are in any rush,\u201d Hannah offered, but it seemed no one was listening to her. Both her own mother and Carl\u2019s crowded around, peering over Hariette\u2019s shoulder, scanning the June page on the pocket calendar.</p><p>\u201cThe sixteenth sounds perfectly lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe closer to the middle of the month the better, from what I hear,\u201d another aunt offered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we need to choose a date right now, do you?\u201d Hannah tried once more.</p><p>Her grandma Morganstern studied her closely, and Hannah realized she\u2019d best not say anything more. Not then, at least.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of June sixteenth?\u201d The question was directed to Carl, who had his fork poised in front of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cGive the young man a chance to eat,\u201d her father said, coming to Carl\u2019s rescue.</p><p>With his mouth full of food, Carl nodded enthusiastically. Hannah felt he was silently commenting on what her father had said. Unfortunately everyone else in the room seemed to think he was agreeing to the wedding date.</p><p>\u201cThat settles that,\u201d Ruth said cheerfully. \u201cThe wedding is set for June sixteenth.\u201d</p><p>The news of Modesto Diaz\u2019s injury spread quickly, and soon a number of Brynn\u2019s students had gathered at the hospital. Again and again Emilio was forced to repeat the grisly details of what had happened\u2014first to the police who came to question him, then to the curious and the fearful.</p><p>Father Grady arrived, and Brynn was grateful. She felt at a loss as to how to help Modesto\u2019s mother and sister deal with the tragedy. After what seemed a lifetime, the surgeon appeared. His look was grave as he announced that the surgery had been a success. Modesto wasn\u2019t completely out of danger, and his condition was guarded. But the teen was doing as well as could be expected.</p><p>Following a translation of the physician\u2019s words, Modesto\u2019s mother clenched her hands together, turned her face toward heaven, and wept loudly. His sister cried silently with relief. For the first time since he\u2019d appeared at her apartment door, some color started to return to Emilio\u2019s face.</p><p>Roberto looked to Brynn and she to him. His relief was evident. Hers, too, she guessed, as she battled down the urge to weep.</p><p>While they\u2019d sat through those interminable hours, Roberto had remained beside his brother, offering Emilio his support and love. The younger Alcantara had needed his brother.</p><p>Brynn, however, had found sitting impossible, so she\u2019d done what she always did when she was nervous: she\u2019d paced. Back and forth, until she\u2019d feared her path would leave permanent creases in the thin carpet.</p><p>Now she felt the need to be close to Roberto. He apparently shared her sudden desire, because he crossed the area. Without a word, he took her into his arms and held her firmly against him. She drank in his strength, absorbed his calm. His hold was tight, almost punishing, as if he planned on never letting her go.</p><p>Brynn knew that the two of them had attracted the attention of the others, but she didn\u2019t care who saw them together. Gradually Roberto did release her, but not before she felt his muscles tighten. His relief turned to anger as he faced Father Grady.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s this neighborhood,\u201d Roberto said between clenched teeth. \u201cIt could have been Emilio who was shot, or you, or Brynn.\u201d His face was tight and fierce. His brother was all the family he had left.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Father Grady said gently. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Roberto stalked to the far side of the room, his back to Brynn.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t entirely certain what was happening. Now wasn\u2019t the time for explanations, but she knew Father Grady would explain everything to her later.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you home now,\u201d Roberto announced starkly to Brynn.</p><p>She followed him through the crowded hospital corridor outside. The cold night air hit her like an unexpected slap. The wind stung her face and eyes as she hurried to keep pace with Roberto.</p> <p>For Brynn\u2019s sake, Roberto tried to control his anger, but he couldn\u2019t think of his younger brother and Modesto facing a nameless gunman on the same streets where children had played only hours earlier. His anger went deep and bordered on rage.</p><p>He focused his resentment on the neighborhood and the frustration he felt each time he\u2019d tried to make a better life for himself and Emilio.</p><p>It could have been his brother lying in that hospital bed. He could have lost Emilio. The thought terrified him. He\u2019d promised his mother that he would watch after his brother, raise him right. He had failed her in other ways, but not this time. By heaven, not this time.</p><p>Roberto glanced over at Brynn, who sat next to him stiffly. She\u2019d never seen this side of him. She didn\u2019t know he could be an angry, frustrated brute. This was what happened when those he loved were threatened.</p><p>Love.</p> <p>Just mentally saying the word made him squirm. He was dangerously close to falling for the pretty Irish teacher. He didn\u2019t need anyone to tell him what a mistake that would be. It went without saying that a college-educated beauty like Brynn Cassidy had nothing in common with the likes of him. She should be dating a stockbroker or an attorney, not someone who had trouble getting the grease from beneath his fingernails.</p><p>He was living in a dream world if he thought anything could develop between them. God had delivered that message loud and clear. Roberto knew what he had to do next.</p><p>First off, he had to stop thinking about Brynn as a friend. They\u2019d never been that. As for making her his lover, however much he would like to entertain the notion, she was off-limits. He\u2019d make excuses not to see her again, and soon enough she\u2019d get the message. Their relationship would be over before it ever started. Whatever it might have been was gone now.</p><p>Having made that decision, Roberto felt some of the hard ball of anger dissipate. He was in control again. His life was back in order.</p><p>One thing he vowed. Somehow, some way, with God\u2019s help, he was going to find his way out of this neighborhood.</p><p>Brynn\u2019s class was quiet and subdued on Monday. Normally her students tested her patience by chattering like monkeys long after the bell rang. Not this day. They filed into the room and sat at their desks and stared at her as though they anticipated some great revelation from her.</p> <p>\u201cBy now most of you have heard about what happened to Modesto,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t fair, Miss Cassidy,\u201d Yolanda said.</p><p>\u201cLife isn\u2019t fair,\u201d Denzil answered.</p><p>\u201cModesto wasn\u2019t doing anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t bad, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he isn\u2019t.\u201d Brynn felt at a loss as to how to answer their fears, nor did it seem right to dig into her lessons when it was obvious her students needed to talk about what had happened to their friend.</p><p>\u201cI went to see him at the hospital,\u201d Emilio announced, his voice void of emotion. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cModesto\u2019s in intensive care. I know because I called,\u201d someone else claimed.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to live, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Brynn couldn\u2019t answer that, so she repeated as best she could what the physician had said. \u201cHis chances are very good, but there\u2019s always the possibility of complications.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t doing nothin\u2019,\u201d Emilio said to no one in particular. \u201cThe police tried to make it sound like we were on the prowl looking for trouble. Man, if I was looking for action, I\u2019d take my posse with me.\u201d</p><p>There were murmurs of agreement.</p><p>Emilio leaned forward and placed his hands over his face. He looked both vulnerable and afraid. Wanting to comfort him, Brynn walked over to his side and placed her hand gently on his shoulder.</p><p>He shrugged it off viciously and glared up at her. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Such behavior wasn\u2019t like Emilio. If she considered any one student an ally, it would be Roberto\u2019s brother.</p><p>She stepped back, but not before Emilio slid out of his seat and stormed out of the room. The glass panel in the door rattled as he slammed it closed.</p><p>\u201cEmilio.\u201d She started after him. If he was caught in the hall without a pass, he\u2019d be sent to the principal\u2019s office. If he mouthed off to Mr. Whalen, he was likely to be suspended a second time, and if that happened, it was doubtful he\u2019d be back.</p><p>Brynn stopped at the door. \u201cSuzie,\u201d she called, \u201cwould you take over for me for a few moments?\u201d</p><p>The teenager\u2019s eyes widened with apprehension before she nodded.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Brynn whispered, and left the classroom. She was breaking another cardinal rule by doing so. If she was discovered, she would receive another formal reprimand. She weighed the decision carefully before stepping into the hallway. Something was very wrong with Emilio, and she had to find out what.</p><p>She found him crouched on the floor next to a dented beige locker at the end of the hall. His head hung between his knees.</p><p>\u201cEmilio.\u201d She said his name gently.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look up.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone,\u201d he said, his voice uncharacteristically hard and cold.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame yourself for what happened to Modesto,\u201d she offered.</p><p>This time he hissed something in Spanish, and for once Brynn was grateful for her limited language skills. One thing was certain: he wasn\u2019t inviting her to talk matters out.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stay here,\u201d she said, looking both ways down the hall. \u201cPlease, Emilio, come back into the class.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIf they find you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I know. I\u2019ll get suspended. Do you really think I care, Miss Cassidy? I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I supposed to appreciate that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He looked away, and it seemed that he was wishing her back into the classroom. \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurting, Emilio. I want to help.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head and stared at the ceiling. \u201cModesto\u2019s the one who\u2019s in pain, not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Modesto wouldn\u2019t be in as much pain if you\u2019d been shot, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he shouted, and slammed his fist into the locker directly beside him. The noise exploded in the silent hallway like a cannon shot, echoing off the sides.</p><p>For sure they\u2019d be found now. Brynn closed her eyes and inhaled a deep, calming breath. Emilio didn\u2019t want her help, didn\u2019t need her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry this happened to you, Emilio,\u201d she said softly. \u201cSo very sorry.\u201d Knowing he wouldn\u2019t accept her help, she turned and started back to her classroom.</p><p>\u201cI ran.\u201d</p><p>She paused. So that was what this was all about. Emilio thought himself a coward because he\u2019d deserted his friend and saved his own life.</p><p>Brynn turned back and squatted next to him. Her legs ached before she spoke. \u201cI would have run, too. It was probably what saved you from being shot as well.\u201d</p><p>Emilio said nothing.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Modesto wouldn\u2019t have tried to escape had you been the one hit first?\u201d</p><p>Again Emilio didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cYou acted instinctively,\u201d Brynn tried again. \u201cYou had nothing with which to defend yourself. The option had been taken away from you.\u201d</p><p>A parched cry worked its way through his throat, and he buried his face in his arms with a muffled sob.</p><p>Brynn longed to touch him, but she was afraid that her comfort was the last thing he sought. Because her muscles were cramping, she placed her knees on the cold floor.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no shame in what you did,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His shoulders shook, and unable to watch him and do nothing, Brynn braced her hand against the curve of his shoulder.</p><p>The pain, the doubt, the fears and self-recriminations, broke like a fire hydrant inside him. His shoulders shook violently with uncontrollable sobs. One after another tumbled from his lips until his cries became those of an injured animal.</p><p>Kneeling at his side, Brynn gently tucked his head against her breast and held him. Gently she rocked back and forth, fighting emotion while the pain poured from Emilio Alcantara\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cWill you be seeing Trey this afternoon?\u201d Michelle asked Jenny.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d They hadn\u2019t made plans to get together, and she had to work later in the day. She\u2019d told him her schedule and had expected to hear from him. Thus far she\u2019d been disappointed.</p><p>Michelle wandered into their living room, a plastic trash bag in hand. She picked up an empty wine bottle and tossed it inside. \u201cYour friend certainly generated a lot of interest.\u201d</p><p>Jenny had noticed that much herself.</p><p>\u201cI had to tell Julia Leonard to wipe the drool off her chin.\u201d</p><p>Jenny smiled.</p><p>\u201cThat guy\u2019s a hunk, girl. How come you never mentioned how handsome he is? It\u2019s like he walked in directly from the range. Someone asked me if he\u2019d left his horse parked outside.\u201d Michelle ditched a paper plate in the trash bag. \u201cThere was something else I noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Jenny asked, tossing a beer can into the accumulated garbage.</p><p>\u201cHe only had eyes for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known Trey LaRue nearly all my life,\u201d Jenny explained.</p><p>Michelle straightened and studied Jenny for a couple of moments. \u201cBy the way, what kind of name is Trey, anyway? It sounds like it\u2019s French or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis real name\u2019s Mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMark? How\u2019d his family get Trey out of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis grandfather\u2019s name was Mark and his father\u2019s name was Mark, and when he was born the story goes that there were so many Marks floating around, they decided to call him Trey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I get it now. Trey for the third Mark,\u201d Michelle murmured.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Jenny returned to picking up the clutter left over from the party.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to marry him?\u201d her roommate shocked her by asking next.</p><p>\u201cMarry him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Michelle asked flippantly. \u201cIt\u2019s as clear as melted snow the guy\u2019s in love with you. When I first met him I thought it was rather sweet of him to travel all this way to see you. It\u2019s a definite boost to a woman\u2019s ego to have a man from her past idolize her. I could certainly do with a couple of men like Trey myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never once mentioned marriage to me, nor will he.\u201d Jenny\u2019s reply was defensive, and she knew it.</p><p>Michelle\u2019s eyebrows flirted with her hairline. \u201cYou\u2019d be tempted to accept his proposal if he did, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d But she wasn\u2019t nearly as confident as she sounded. She didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d say if Trey proposed. One thing was certain: she didn\u2019t like the turn their conversation had taken. It hadn\u2019t bothered her when Michelle mentioned the open curiosity of their friends toward Trey. It hadn\u2019t hurt her pride any to have Trey fend off the friendly advances made by the more aggressive of her peers. Frankly, Jenny didn\u2019t blame her friends. Trey had the same overwhelming effect upon her senses.</p><p>The few kisses they\u2019d shared before being interrupted had haunted her. She wanted him to kiss and touch her again just so she\u2019d know what they\u2019d shared had been as good as she remembered.</p><p>\u201cCan you honestly picture someone like Trey living in New York?\u201d she asked Michelle heatedly. \u201cWithin a month he\u2019d go stark, raving mad. Trey\u2019s the type of man who needs plenty of wide-open space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he loved you . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jenny wouldn\u2019t consider it. Besides, it was a moot point. The very idea that he\u2019d propose was ludicrous. He was in town only a few days, exactly how many he had yet to tell her. When he left she\u2019d ride out to the airport with him and see him off. But the mere thought of Trey heading back to Montana produced an emptiness she couldn\u2019t shake.</p><p>\u201cJenny?\u201d Michelle broke into her musings.</p><p>She smiled weakly and resumed her task, but her mind wasn\u2019t on it.</p><p>\u201cOf course if you married Trey, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily need to live in New York. There are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting I return to Montana?\u201d Jenny demanded. \u201cWhat are you trying to tell me, Michelle? That it\u2019s time I admitted the truth, that I\u2019m a no-talent wannabe and that I\u2019ll never make it on Broadway or, for that matter, any place else?\u201d She was desperate to breathe by the time she\u2019d finished.</p> <p>Visibly shocked by Jenny\u2019s outburst, Michelle stood frozen and stared at her.</p><p>Jenny sagged into the chair. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t either,\u201d Michelle whispered. \u201cI believe in you as strongly as I do in myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d They\u2019d been each other\u2019s cheering squad for too long for Jenny to doubt her friend now. Over the last three years they\u2019d been through so much together. Jenny knew Michelle wished her nothing but unbridled success. Anything else would have been completely out of character.</p><p>The phone rang just then.</p><p>The last few days had been a tense time for them both. Michelle was due to hear the results of her second audition with John Peterman. If it were in her power, Jenny would award her friend the role, but it wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cYou want me to get it?\u201d she asked Michelle.</p><p>\u201cNo, I will,\u201d Michelle answered, and walked over to the wall phone. She reached for it and paused, her hand inches from the receiver. \u201cYou get it, all right?\u201d she asked, and moved away.</p><p>It pealed a third time before Jenny could reach it.</p><p>\u201cI should be the one to answer,\u201d Michelle said abruptly and ripped the receiver off the hook. \u201cThis is Michelle Jordan,\u201d she greeted cheerfully, as if she had been sitting idly by the phone without a care in the world. She listened for a moment, then, \u201cWell, hello,\u201d she said seductively, eyeing Jenny. \u201cAnd how are you?\u201d</p><p>A second pause while Jenny was left to wonder who was at the other end of the line.</p><p>\u201cOf course. . . . No, it\u2019s no problem whatsoever.\u201d She pressed the mouthpiece against her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s Trey. He wants to talk to you. Do you want me to tell him you\u2019re here, or would you rather I made up some excuse and told him you were out for the day?\u201d</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>Emilio was absent from school the following afternoon. Brynn\u2019s heart sank. She couldn\u2019t very well cancel the most important test this term because one student hadn\u2019t bothered to show.</p> <p>Emilio had left school the day before without returning to class, but when Brynn had tried to reach him later, the phone had gone unanswered. With her own commitments, she hadn\u2019t been able to seek out Roberto, nor had she been able to talk to him.</p><p>Her day felt incomplete without some form of contact with Roberto. Little by little she\u2019d opened her heart to Emilio\u2019s older brother. There was such passion in Roberto, such intensity. The other men she\u2019d dated had been neither hot nor cold. Nothing excited them. Not injustice. Not good fortune. Not tickets to a play-off football game. Brynn had been left wondering what would happen if any of them ever won the lottery.</p><p>There was no doubt in her mind, however, where Roberto stood on any number of subjects. He rarely hesitated to make his opinions known. Although she often disagreed with him, she appreciated the fact that he was willing to take a stand. He cared deeply for those he loved. That was what had attracted her to him in the beginning.</p><p>Every time he kissed her the experience left her shaken. One thing was certain: Roberto Alcantara would never be a lukewarm lover.</p><p>\u201cIs everyone ready for their midterms?\u201d she asked the class. Standing in front of the room, she cradled the test papers against her chest.</p><p>A low rumble of responses came from her students. As the papers were being handed out, Brynn noted that Emilio wasn\u2019t the only student absent that day. Modesto\u2019s desk was conspicuously empty. His condition remained listed as serious, but from what she\u2019d heard he would soon be upgraded to satisfactory.</p><p>Mike Glasser was gone as well. That disappointed her. She\u2019d tried hard to bring the loner out of his shell, but nothing had worked. His attitude baffled her. When she looked directly at him, she assumed his mind was a thousand miles away, yet when she quizzed him, he knew the answers. The boy was keenly intelligent, but he refused to apply himself.</p><p>Brynn walked around the room while her class took the exam. This was by far the most important test she\u2019d given, and she\u2019d worked long hours composing the essay questions. Her students\u2019 responses were the best way she had of gauging how well she\u2019d done her job.</p><p>The class discussions were thought-provoking and often heated. Brynn was thrilled that she could make her students care about what had happened in the world fifty years earlier. She felt it was important for them to do more than memorize dates and names.</p><p>Her goal was for them to look back at history and learn from the past. She wanted them to gain insight and perspective from a journal written by a teenage Jewish girl, who, despite the years separating their worlds, wasn\u2019t unlike them. It excited Brynn when her students recognized that they shared the same dreams, the same aspirations, as Anne Frank.</p><p>More important, Brynn wanted her students to reason through this material and willingly share their feelings with her. A number of the test questions had no right or wrong answers. All she wanted was for each of her students to reflect on this time period in American and European history and then express their thoughts.</p><p>When Brynn strolled past Suzie\u2019s desk, she was surprised to discover that the girl\u2019s paper was blank.</p><p>Unwilling to break the concentration of any of the others, Brynn resisted the urge to ask Suzie if something was wrong. She noticed that the girl wore a maternity top and wondered if anyone else recognized Suzie was pregnant.</p><p>Pen in hand, Suzie briefly acknowledged Brynn, then bent forward and started to write.</p><p>As Brynn walked past Emilio\u2019s empty desk, she couldn\u2019t help wondering what had kept him from class. It wasn\u2019t as if he hadn\u2019t known about this test or realized its significance. Brynn had been talking about it for several days, reviewing the material so it would be fresh in their minds. Now and again she\u2019d purposely screw up the dates and would take pride when someone, often a student she wouldn\u2019t expect to know the difference, would correct her.</p><p>After class had been dismissed, Brynn quickly reviewed the test results and was pleased with what she read. Because she was anxious to talk to Emilio, she left school as soon as she could without checking for messages. She rarely received anything more than the dittoed sheets the school printed for all staff members. With the advent of Christmas, and most all the classes winding down, she didn\u2019t expect anything of real importance.</p><p>Eager to see Roberto, Brynn walked to his garage first. The sky was dark with thick gray clouds the color of tempered steel, and the wind added an extra chill to the late afternoon. Nevertheless, Brynn was happy. She\u2019d had her first real date with Roberto, and even though their evening had ended abruptly, their time together had proved what she\u2019d long suspected. Roberto cared about her the same way she did about him.</p><p>Brynn\u2019s parents were anxious for her to come home for Christmas, but she\u2019d already decided against making the trip. She hadn\u2019t told her mother, and wouldn\u2019t, but she preferred to stay right here in New York with Roberto. She\u2019d mentioned him in passing several times, and in the last telephone conversation, she\u2019d confessed she was strongly attracted to him.</p><p>The bell chimed over the doorway when she entered his garage. She rubbed her hands together to chase away the chill. No one greeted her.</p><p>\u201cIs anyone here?\u201d she called out, thinking it odd that Roberto hadn\u2019t locked up the garage.</p><p>A minute later Roberto appeared, dressed in greasy overalls. He wiped his hands clean on a rag, his face devoid of emotion. He nodded once and greeted her without revealing any pleasure in seeing her. \u201cHello, Brynn.\u201d</p><p>None of the warmth or welcome she\u2019d felt on their dinner date was apparent. Puzzled by his attitude, Brynn felt like walking out the door and coming back to try this all over again.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . .\u201d Baffled, she wasn\u2019t sure what had happened. \u201cEmilio wasn\u2019t in class this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was an important test.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged as though to say that was of no importance to him.</p><p>\u201cIs Emilio ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen where was he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRunning errands for me,\u201d Roberto informed her briskly.</p><p>\u201cYou mean to say you knew he was purposely skipping classes and you let him?\u201d Anger swelled inside her, but she did a good job of maintaining her composure.</p><p>\u201cYes. Emilio announced this morning that he didn\u2019t feel like going to school, and I told him the choice was his.\u201d</p><p>This was a discussion they\u2019d had in the past, and they\u2019d always ended up arguing about the importance of education. Nothing she said would change Roberto\u2019s opinion, and certainly nothing he said would alter her feelings.</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to Emilio,\u201d she said, unwilling to be drawn into a verbal battle neither one of them could win.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t here,\u201d Roberto continued stoically.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you expect him back?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Brynn could see that discussing Emilio would be a losing proposition. She looked past Roberto, hoping to gain perspective on what was happening between them.</p><p>\u201cHow was your day?\u201d she asked in an effort to put the conversation back on an even keel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBusy.\u201d He glanced over his shoulder as though to say there was plenty left for him to do and her silly questions were keeping him from his chores.</p><p>Brynn wasn\u2019t sure what to do or say. She could play cute word games and dance around the issue, but that would solve nothing. They\u2019d done all that before.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve got something to say to me, Roberto, I\u2019d appreciate it if you came out and said it.\u201d She stiffened, knowing instinctively what was on his mind.</p><p>A flicker of surprise flashed in and out of his eyes. He hadn\u2019t anticipated her being this direct, she guessed. Normally she wasn\u2019t. Whenever it was possible she avoided confrontation, but she\u2019d learned that in dealing with Roberto, she was better off taking the offensive.</p> <p>From the first time since she\u2019d arrived, he hesitated.</p><p>\u201cLet me say it for you, then,\u201d she offered. \u201cYou\u2019ve come to some monumental decision about us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrynn\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me finish,\u201d she insisted, forcing herself to sound light and airy, as though his attitude didn\u2019t affect her one way or the other. \u201cYou\u2019ve decided that it\u2019d probably be best for us not to see each other again. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>His jaw had gone white. \u201cSomething along those lines, but I don\u2019t think now is the time to discuss it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt seems to me this is as good a time as any,\u201d she responded with a flippant air. \u201cYou know what they say about there being no time like the present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Roberto?\u201d she asked simply. Her chest tightened, and this time she couldn\u2019t hide the pain in her voice. \u201cDid I do something unforgivable? Something so terrible that you can\u2019t find it in your heart to forgive me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said harshly, and briefly closed his eyes. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth . . .\u201d He stopped himself, then started again, his eyes as gentle as she\u2019d ever seen them. He didn\u2019t want to hurt her, that much was evident.</p><p>\u201cWhatever it is,\u201d she whispered forcefully, \u201cwe can work it out.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI never intended to become emotionally involved with you. We\u2019re both intelligent enough to realize we\u2019re all wrong together.\u201d He clenched the muscles along the side of his jaw, and when he spoke his voice was filled with regret. \u201cI blame myself. Matters should never have gone this far.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do? Forget I ever met you? When I bump into you on the street, do you want me to turn and walk the other way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been the type of person who can turn my feelings on and off at will. Tell me what it is you want from me. Just tell me and I promise I\u2019ll walk out that door and it\u2019ll be as though we\u2019d never met.\u201d</p><p>For a long time he didn\u2019t answer her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m not a difficult person to talk to, Roberto. At least others don\u2019t seem to have a problem. Tell me,\u201d she said again, more emphatically this time, \u201cwhat is it you want.\u201d</p><p>His hands clenched into fists. \u201cI want you to leave New York,\u201d he said, his voice strained. \u201cYou don\u2019t belong here. You and all this nonsense about teaching these kids to wish for the impossible. Try filling Modesto\u2019s head with that garbage now, why don\u2019t you? He\u2019s fighting for his life. We\u2019re light-years away from anything more than survival. You\u2019re beating your head against a stone wall, only you haven\u2019t learned that yet. Personally I don\u2019t want to be the one who\u2019s left to pick up the pieces when you do.\u201d</p><p>His words ripped open her heart, and just then she found it impossible to reply.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be someone else for you soon enough,\u201d he continued.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone else?\u201d She couldn\u2019t believe he would suggest she was the type to leap from one relationship to the next in some crazy form of emotional hopscotch.</p><p>\u201cWho you date is your own business. All I ask is that you leave me out of it.\u201d</p><p>It, she reasoned, meant her life. He wanted nothing more to do with her.</p><p>Had she possessed a sliver of pride, Brynn would have turned and walked out. Instead she forced herself to stay, even when she knew that it meant more pain.</p><p>Her emotions battled with each other. She wanted to strike back at him, hurt him the same way he\u2019d hurt her. And in the next millisecond she longed to throw herself in his arms and beg him to change his mind.</p><p>In the end she did neither. From some reserve of strength she knew nothing about, she scrounged up a genuine, heartfelt smile. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she told him, \u201cthere will be someone else.\u201d In time. Then, because she couldn\u2019t make herself leave without touching him, Brynn gently placed her hand against his cheek.</p><p>A muscle leapt in his face as he steeled himself against her.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Roberto. Godspeed.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her hand and was about to turn away when he reached out and grabbed hold of her shoulder and whirled her around. Crushed against him as she was, Brynn buried her face in his chest and clung. His kiss was hard and urgent, and she knew the moment he released her that he regretted ever having touched her.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Brynn Cassidy. Have a good life.\u201d</p><p>She nearly sobbed aloud, but she managed to hold the emotion inside. \u201cYou too, Roberto Alcantara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you stand there and do nothing?\u201d Goodness demanded of Shirley. \u201cRoberto should have his head examined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPersonally, I agree, but unfortunately he has a free will to decide whatever he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFree will? I\u2019m telling you right now that\u2019s the crux of the problem with humans. They can do anything they want, and they\u2019ve let it go to their heads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the whole tamale in a nutshell,\u201d Shirley concurred, then scratched her head, wondering why that sounded wrong.</p><p>\u201cI have half a mind to shake up this city.\u201d</p><p>Shirley wished Mercy were with her. She\u2019d seen Goodness in this mood before, and it was downright frightening. The last time had been in Bremerton, Washington, when Goodness had gotten her hand on an aircraft carrier. The naval command was still trying to figure that one out.</p><p>\u201cGoodness, are you thinking what I think you\u2019re thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone needs to shake up this town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPersonally,\u201d Shirley said, trying to be as diplomatic as possible, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t advise you to mess with New York.\u201d</p><p>Goodness appeared unconvinced. \u201cTexas frightens the wings off me, but I can handle New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t think this is a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d</p><p>Shirley didn\u2019t want to know. Oh my, where was Mercy when she really needed her? When Goodness was in this frame of mind, she was more than Shirley could handle alone.</p><p>Shirley glanced around her, searching for help.</p><p>\u201cStaten Island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Shirley cried in a panic, leaping in front of her friend, \u201cnot the Statue of Liberty!\u201d</p><p>Goodness pretended not to notice her, which frightened Shirley all the more. \u201cLet me see,\u201d Goodness mumbled, \u201cwhat could I do to jar a few folks into realizing the error of their ways?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think we should talk this out first?\u201d Shirley asked hopefully. \u201cI mean, just because matters are going poorly with my assignment, there\u2019s no reason to take it out on the entire city. There\u2019re plenty of good things happening, too.\u201d</p><p>Goodness hesitated, and hope surged through Shirley that she might be able to reason her friend out of pulling some disastrous stunt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure everything must be going well with Hannah and Joshua.\u201d As soon as she spoke, Shirley recognized the error of her ways.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, they\u2019re not going well at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannah and Carl have set their wedding date for June sixteenth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought . . . didn\u2019t you say that Hannah had fallen in love with Joshua Shadduck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has, and he\u2019s head over heels crazy about her.\u201d</p><p>Shirley assumed this would be good news. \u201cI thought that was what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>Shirley remained puzzled. \u201cThe last thing you told me was that Hannah had agreed to break off her engagement with Carl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought, too,\u201d Goodness said with a disgruntled sigh, \u201conly it didn\u2019t happen that way. Instead her family pressured her into setting a wedding date, and before she knew what to do, it was all decided for her. She\u2019s scheduled to marry Carl Rabinsky in June.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, poor, poor Hannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannah nothing,\u201d Goodness cried. \u201cWhat about Joshua? He trusted her. She\u2019s supposed to be in love with him, remember? The fact is, I don\u2019t trust Hannah to do the right thing by Joshua.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of time yet,\u201d Shirley said in an effort to placate her friend. \u201cJust because Hannah and Joshua\u2019s relationship has gone slightly off course doesn\u2019t mean you should do anything so drastic as disrupt the best-known New York landmark.\u201d</p><p>Goodness didn\u2019t agree or disagree with her. \u201cI\u2019m so frustrated with these humans, I could scream.\u201d</p><p>Shirley was about to suggest just that when to her great relief Mercy arrived, looking serene and happy.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happenin\u2019?\u201d Mercy asked as though she hadn\u2019t a care in the world.</p><p>While Goodness went into a short explanation about Hannah and Joshua, Shirley studied the other angel. Then it came to her in a flash. Mercy had been up to something herself.</p><p>\u201cMercy, I\u2019m shocked at you,\u201d Shirley cried. Oh my, what would Gabriel do if he learned about this?</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mercy asked, but wasn\u2019t able to hide a guilty look.</p><p>\u201cTell me where you\u2019ve been!\u201d Shirley asked, her eyes narrowing.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Mercy had perfected that look of innocence. She might even be able to fool Gabriel.</p><p>Although she asked, Shirley knew. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me, please don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve been riding the escalators again?\u201d</p><p>Mercy shifted her gaze away. \u201cJust for a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMercy.\u201d Shirley was outraged. One of them had to show a little responsibility. Why oh why did it have to be her?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d jeopardize our entire mission by doing anything so silly.\u201d She closed her eyes and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m in the mood for a little fun myself,\u201d Goodness said.</p><p>\u201cGoodness, no,\u201d Shirley cried.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna have some fun?\u201d Goodness asked Mercy.</p><p>\u201cOh, I have been, but after what happened this afternoon, I\u2019m game for just about anything.\u201d</p><p>Shirley opened and closed her mouth. At this point her protests would fall upon deaf ears, and she knew it.</p><p>A twinkle sparked from Goodness\u2019s eyes as she smiled over at Shirley. \u201cAre you coming along or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re headed for trouble.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Goodness laughed. \u201cSo what else is new? There\u2019s only so much of this being on my best behavior that I can take.\u201d</p><p>Mercy released an exaggerated sigh. \u201cBoy oh boy, do I identify with that. I can\u2019t remember the last time I slid down an escalator railing. By golly, it felt good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want the truth, I would have thought you\u2019d have discovered the Holland Tunnel before now.\u201d</p><p>The corners of Mercy\u2019s mouth started to quiver.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Shirley asked suspiciously.</p><p>Mercy gave an innocent shrug. \u201cRemember that traffic jam all the newspapers reported not long ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou caused that?\u201d</p><p>Mercy grasped her hands behind her back and shook her head. \u201cNot me. I didn\u2019t have a thing to do with it.\u201d</p><p>Goodness\u2019s eyes lit up brighter than a Fourth of July sparkler. \u201cIf Mercy can mess around with the Holland Tunnel, then no one\u2019s going to mind if Lady Liberty takes a short stroll.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGoodness, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Shirley, let your feathers dangle a little. Gabriel isn\u2019t going to hear about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should risk it,\u201d she said cautiously. \u201cReally. Shouldn\u2019t we talk this out?\u201d</p><p>Goodness shook her head. \u201cAre you in or out, Shirley? It\u2019s time to separate the wheat from the chaff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh . . .\u201d</p><p>Goodness and Mercy started to pull away. \u201cI\u2019m in,\u201d Shirley said hastily. \u201cI just hope I don\u2019t end up playing a harp for all eternity.\u201d</p> <p>The talk filled the deli all day, until Hannah was sick of hearing about it. Some people, obviously tourists, claimed that the Statue of Liberty had done a 360-degree turn. It was by far the most ridiculous thing Hannah had ever heard.</p><p>Someone from the financial district claimed he\u2019d watched the grand lady make the complete rotation. There were said to be news tapes of it as well.</p><p>Hannah remained skeptical. Years earlier, some magician claimed to have made the Statue of Liberty disappear. All this talk now didn\u2019t impress Hannah. Besides, she had other matters on her mind.</p><p>She needed to see Joshua and had been unable to reach him all afternoon. Making phone calls during business hours was difficult for her. Privacy was always at a premium in the kitchen, and she didn\u2019t dare risk someone listening in on her conversation.</p><p>When she had a free moment, a rare commodity this busy time of the year, she raced upstairs and phoned Joshua\u2019s office. Unfortunately he was out, but his secretary promised to give him the message as soon as he returned.</p><p>But Joshua couldn\u2019t return her call, and they both knew it, so Hannah was left to fret. When she did see him, she wasn\u2019t sure she could tell him about what happened.</p><p>December was the busiest month for the deli. Her father\u2019s meat and cheese trays had a reputation that was citywide. After the normal lunchtime rush, Hannah was left to deal with people who stopped by to order the trays.</p><p>She was busy with a customer when she saw Joshua. Although she was desperate to talk to him, this was the worst possible place.</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll change that from slices of cheddar cheese to Monterey Jack,\u201d Mrs. Synder, a longtime customer, was saying.</p><p>Hannah bit into her lower lip and watched as Joshua made his way to the counter where her father was making thick pastrami sandwiches.</p><p>\u201cMonterey Jack,\u201d the woman repeated, louder this time.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d Hannah said, and quickly made the notation.</p><p>\u201cDo you have Greek olives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. No,\u201d she said quickly, correcting herself.</p><p>\u201cDo you or don\u2019t you?\u201d came the impatient question.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Hannah forced herself to concentrate on completing the order form.</p><p>\u201cHow much will that be?\u201d</p><p>Grateful that she was close to finishing, Hannah quickly tallied the figures.</p><p>\u201cReally? I expected it to be much more than that,\u201d Mrs. Synder said, looking pleased.</p><p>Hannah immediately refigured the total. She was prime for making a mistake.</p><p>\u201cDo you still serve that fantastic cheesecake?\u201d the woman asked.</p><p>A male voice answered the question for her. \u201cIt\u2019s the best in New York.\u201d</p><p>Joshua.</p><p>Hannah\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, her gaze connecting with his. \u201cMy mother makes it herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrow one in for me, then,\u201d Mrs. Synder said, grinning broadly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to.\u201d Hannah added the cheesecake to the tally. \u201cEverything will be ready for you the afternoon of the twenty-second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for your help.\u201d</p><p>Hannah\u2019s gaze moved past Mrs. Synder to Joshua. His eyes were warm and tender as they met hers.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d she asked, turning the page on her ordering pad. She could feel the color creep up her neck. Anyone who knew her well would realize that Joshua wasn\u2019t just any customer.</p><p>\u201cHello, beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoshua,\u201d she mumbled under her breath, \u201cbe careful, someone might hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t bother me. You are beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I think you are, too.\u201d</p><p>He laughed then, but not loudly enough to attract attention. \u201cYou phoned me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and chanced a look in her father\u2019s direction. She was grateful to see that he was otherwise occupied. Her mother was busy in the kitchen but could appear at any moment.</p><p>\u201cYou talked to Carl?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, then nodded. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t able to break the engagement.\u201d</p><p>Even from her side of the counter, Hannah could sense Joshua\u2019s frustration.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t tell him, not then,\u201d she hurried to explain. \u201cWhen I arrived, I learned that he\u2019d been fired from his job. He got in an argument with the headmaster. Carl was depressed and miserable. I couldn\u2019t add to his distress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you plan to do, marry him and make him feel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what it sounds like, Hannah.\u201d His voice was gentle, but she knew he was disappointed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never marry Carl. I promise you that. Please, you\u2019ve got to believe me.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing, as if placing his faith in her were something he wasn\u2019t certain he should do. Hannah fought to keep from blurting how much she loved him.</p><p>\u201cYoung man, is my daughter helping you?\u201d</p><p>It was her father. Hannah tensed, and her eyes pleaded with Joshua\u2019s not to reveal their secret. It would only be for a while longer, she promised him silently.</p><p>He pulled his gaze away from her. \u201cShe\u2019s been very helpful,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cAre you ordering a meat tray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I might give it a try.\u201d He reached for a brochure and began to leaf through it. \u201cYou\u2019re Mr. Morganstern, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he said just when it seemed her father was about to turn away. Hannah didn\u2019t understand why Joshua didn\u2019t let him leave. Certainly he felt as awkward about all this as she did.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her father\u2019s warm smile came through on the lone word.</p><p>\u201cJoshua Shadduck,\u201d Joshua said, extending his hand across the counter.</p><p>Her father hesitated before peeling off the protective plastic glove from his fingers and exchanging handshakes.</p><p>\u201cThis is my daughter, Hannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019ve met Hannah before,\u201d Joshua said, his gaze resting on her.</p><p>Hannah tensed, afraid Joshua had completely lost his patience with her and was about to reveal the truth.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s delivered lunches to my office a number of times. Hannah\u2019s a wonderful young woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Naturally her mother and I share your opinion.\u201d Her father placed his arm affectionately around her shoulder. \u201cWhere\u2019s your office?\u201d</p><p>Joshua told him.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re an attorney.\u201d</p><p>Hannah noticed that her father\u2019s voice had gone a shade cooler and wondered if Joshua had sensed the difference himself.</p><p>\u201cI was recently made a partner in the firm,\u201d Joshua explained proudly.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m rather pleased myself.\u201d Joshua\u2019s gaze returned to Hannah.</p><p>It must have been the warm way in which he regarded her that prompted her father to continue the conversation.</p><p>Generally he didn\u2019t spend a lot of time chatting with customers.</p><p>\u201cWe have reason to celebrate as well,\u201d he said, gently squeezing Hannah\u2019s shoulder. \u201cOur daughter was recently engaged.\u201d</p><p>Joshua\u2019s smile dimmed somewhat. \u201cThen congratulations are in order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said without emotion.</p><p>\u201cMy wife and I feel truly blessed to have our daughter. She\u2019s our greatest joy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, please, I\u2019m sure Mr. Shadduck doesn\u2019t want to hear all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. You do my heart proud. The world is a better place because of you.\u201d</p><p>Hannah was embarrassed, and she was certain Joshua found all this amusing.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a lovely girl,\u201d Joshua told her father.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll make a beautiful bride, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d Joshua was quick to concur.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure my wife and I will be sending out wedding invitations to a select few of our most valued customers. Now that the date\u2019s been set we can start making up the guest list.\u201d</p><p>Joshua said nothing, but his eyes narrowed fractionally.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wedding date for your daughter has been set?\u201d Joshua interrupted.</p><p>\u201cYes, we decided that only last night, isn\u2019t that right, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>Hannah nodded miserably.</p><p>\u201cJune sixteenth,\u201d her father informed him.</p><p>Joshua\u2019s gaze didn\u2019t leave hers. \u201cCongratulations, Hannah,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure you and your young man will be very happy.\u201d Having said that, he turned and walked out the door.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>Trey didn\u2019t dislike New York. If anything, he was pleasantly surprised. He\u2019d expected it to be the concrete jungle he\u2019d read about, with treeless, crime-ridden streets. He was confident there was plenty of crime, but he hadn\u2019t seen any. And even in the heart of Manhattan he\u2019d noticed an abundance of trees.</p><p>If he had any complaints, it was the noise. He wondered how a man was supposed to sleep through all that racket. The traffic outside his hotel never ceased\u2014horns honking, brakes screeching. And he was bombarded by an array of sounds he could never hope to identify; he heard them all, even twenty stories up in his hotel room.</p><p>The city had its own clamor, nothing like the sounds in the country: the cry of a lone wolf, the hoot of an owl as it flew with the moonlight bouncing off its wing . . . Trey imagined that given the opportunity, he\u2019d become accustomed to city noises. But there was a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of his ever living in New York City. No, he was a country boy, and like John Denver, he thanked God for that. Too much more of life here and he\u2019d have men with nets chasing him through Central Park.</p><p>An early riser by nature, Trey was up and out the door just after dawn, heading for the hole-in-the-wall doughnut shop across the street from the hotel. The hotel served a decent cup of coffee, but there was no way he was going to pay a buck fifty for a two-bit cup of coffee. The doughnut shop was more to his liking, although he couldn\u2019t say that anyone had been all that friendly. He\u2019d been coming in for coffee and a doughnut every morning since he\u2019d arrived, and no one had said much of anything to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The same people were there every morning, too. Some businessman who drank his coffee and shared his company with the financial section of the newspaper. A lady who came in wearing tennis shoes and walked out in high heels.</p><p>Trey sat at the counter, sipping his coffee and watching the short-order cook, a rotund fellow with a prickly disposition, fry an order of hash browns. A waitress who looked to be in her forties bustled around refilling coffee.</p><p>Actually, Trey realized, he wasn\u2019t in the mood for company this morning. He had some heavy-duty thinking to do.</p><p>Twice he\u2019d asked Jenny to leave New York and come back to Montana with him. Twice she\u2019d told him no. The time had come for him to play his trump card, give her some incentive to return to Custer.</p> <p>He planned to ask her to be his wife.</p><p>Generally when a man proposed to a woman he was fairly confident of her response. Trey figured his chances with Jenny were less than fifty-fifty. Although he\u2019d worked hard to build up his herd, he didn\u2019t have a whole lot in the way of material wealth to offer her. A few hundred head of cattle, a run-down house that badly needed a woman\u2019s touch. And a heart so full of love that he nearly burst wide open every time he thought of Jenny and himself raising a family together.</p><p>Trey was a realist, and he was well aware that he couldn\u2019t compete with the bright lights of Broadway. He didn\u2019t have any diamond ring to offer her, either. Not yet.</p><p>The fact was, he hadn\u2019t thought about asking Jenny to marry him until after they\u2019d kissed that first time. He\u2019d always dreamed it would be like that with them, but the reality had knocked him for a loop. Jenny\u2019s kisses gave him hope that she might harbor some tenderness for him.</p><p>Never having proposed to a woman before, Trey had no idea how to go about it. Did a man of the nineties get down on one knee? Should he remove his hat and place it over his heart? None of those things sounded right to him. But since he was asking Jenny the most important question of his life, he didn\u2019t figure he should do it without showing some semblance of respect.</p> <p>On impulse, Trey slipped off the stool and looked around the doughnut shop. The place held the same five or six people who frequented the place every morning.</p><p>\u201cCan I have your attention, please,\u201d he said in a loud voice.</p><p>The businessman lowered the newspaper. The cook turned around, the spatula raised in one hand.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Trey LaRue,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been having coffee here every morning since I arrived in this city, and it seems time I introduced myself. I take it you folks all know each other.\u201d</p><p>The five other customers stared back blankly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know each other?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d It was the woman with one high heel and one tennis shoe.</p><p>\u201cWell then, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time you introduced yourselves to one another? I\u2019m Trey, and I\u2019m visiting from Montana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Trey,\u201d the waitress responded. \u201cI\u2019m Trixie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Bob, and I\u2019m in advertising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Mary Lou, and I\u2019m an assistant editor at a publishing house.\u201d She waved one shoe in greeting.</p><p>The others went around the compact space and introduced themselves and told what they did for a living. Trey acknowledged each one with a brisk nod.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you to New York?\u201d The question came from the cook, whose name was Steve.</p><p>\u201cI came to ask a special woman to be my wife.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHas she agreed?\u201d This came from his editor friend.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d He splayed his fingers through his hair, feeling less confident about his decision. \u201cThe fact is, I haven\u2019t asked her yet. I\u2019m not exactly sure how to go about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust come right out and ask her,\u201d Bob advised.</p><p>\u201cBut wine and dine her,\u201d was Trixie\u2019s advice.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Bob teased, \u201cget her good and soused first.\u201d</p><p>Mary Lou shook her head slowly. \u201cDon\u2019t you listen to any of that. You tell that young woman what\u2019s in your heart. That\u2019s all you need to do, and if she feels as strongly about you as you do about her, nothing else will be necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t take her to a fancy dinner, then?\u201d Trey asked. His newfound friends confused him more than they helped.</p><p>\u201cDinner and champagne won\u2019t hurt,\u201d Trixie assured him, \u201cbut Mary Lou\u2019s right. Just tell this special lady what\u2019s in your heart and go from there.\u201d</p><p>That sounded like a lot less trouble than getting down on one knee, Trey decided.</p><p>\u201cYou might try singing to her.\u201d</p><p>Everyone turned to stare at Steve, Trey included. As far as Trey was concerned, there were certain things a man didn\u2019t do, and break into song was one of them. One of Jenny\u2019s male friends might consider that, but not him.</p><p>\u201cWomen like romance, and there ain\u2019t nothing more romantic than to sing. You don\u2019t even have to have that great a voice,\u201d Steve added, a cigarette hanging from the side of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be doing any singing,\u201d Trey said emphatically.</p><p>\u201cYou love her, don\u2019t you?\u201d Steve smashed the cigarette into an ashtray.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen romance her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right about that,\u201d the assistant editor acknowledged. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a woman alive who doesn\u2019t want to be courted by the man she loves.\u201d</p><p>Singing was out of the question, but there were other ways to prove he was as tenderhearted as the men she\u2019d dated in the big city. \u201cWhat about flowers and chocolates?\u201d</p><p>Only the day before, Trey had walked into one of those fancy sweet shops by accident. He\u2019d been blown away at the prices. Why, a man could feed a horse for a month on what they wanted for a box of chocolates! French ones.</p><p>Mary Lou shook her head. \u201cBe more imaginative than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJenny loves those fat bagels vendors sell on the street corners here,\u201d he said, thinking out loud.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t woo a woman with bagels,\u201d the guy in advertising insisted. He folded the newspaper and tucked it under his arm. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get to the office. You\u2019ll let us know what happens, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing,\u201d Trey promised. He checked his watch. It was early yet. Jenny would still be sleeping, but he\u2019d told her he\u2019d be by to pick her up this morning. She wanted to take him up to the top of the World Trade Center.</p><p>Trey left some change on the counter. \u201cI appreciate the advice,\u201d he told his newfound friends.</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d Trixie said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s getting married, he\u2019ll need it,\u201d the short-order cook teased, then laughed when Trixie swatted him across the backside with a dishrag.</p><p>An hour later Trey stood outside Jenny\u2019s apartment complex. He paced the sidewalk in front of her building, rehearsing in his mind what he wanted to say. It took another ten minutes before he\u2019d gathered up enough gumption to go inside.</p><p>He\u2019d no sooner knocked than the door flew open and there was Jenny, standing on the other side. When she saw him, her face lit up with a smile as bright as a July sun. As long as he lived, he\u2019d never grow weary of seeing Jenny smile.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019,\u201d he greeted her, touching the edge of his hat in a genteel salute.</p><p>\u201cOh, Trey, you\u2019ll never guess what.\u201d</p><p>Before he could prepare himself, she leapt into his arms. Whatever it was that brought Jenny this close must be good, he thought.</p><p>\u201cIrene phoned this morning!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIrene\u2019s your agent, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Then, not giving him an opportunity to ask anything more, she blurted out, \u201cJohn Peterman phoned and asked if she had an audio of me.\u201d</p><p>Trey didn\u2019t know who this John Peterman was, but he was fairly certain he wasn\u2019t going to like the other man.</p><p>As soon as she could, Hannah left the deli to find Joshua. If she explained how she\u2019d been pressured into setting a wedding date, surely he\u2019d understand. Surely he\u2019d be sympathetic and willing to listen to reason.</p><p>The angry, pained look in his eyes haunted her, especially knowing that she was responsible for putting it there. Joshua didn\u2019t deserve to be treated as if she were ashamed of loving him. Yet she could find no fair way out of this dilemma.</p><p>Her first stop was at Joshua\u2019s office. When he wasn\u2019t there, she didn\u2019t know what to do. Depressed and miserable, she started walking, barely aware of her destination. She was unconscious of the street sounds, the people who moved crisply past her; all she could think to do was walk.</p><p>She appreciated Joshua\u2019s feelings. If the situation were reversed, she\u2019d feel the same way. Joshua was an honorable man, and it went against his grain to be involved with a woman engaged to another man. Nor was he comfortable meeting her without her parents\u2019 knowledge.</p><p>Hannah didn\u2019t like that aspect of their relationship, either, but for now it couldn\u2019t be helped. She didn\u2019t want to break the engagement with Carl until this matter with the school had been cleared up.</p><p>Suddenly aware of her surroundings, Hannah realized she was close to her grandmother\u2019s apartment.</p><p>Sylvia\u2019s tired eyes brightened when she opened the door. \u201cHannah, my dear, this is a pleasant surprise!\u201d</p><p>Hannah kissed her grandmother\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cI just brewed myself a pot of tea. Join me, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love some tea.\u201d Hannah followed her grandmother into the kitchen, then carried the tray with two dainty china cups into the living room.</p><p>Hannah loved this room, with its personal touches. An end table with a small clock that had been in the family for close to a hundred years. Antique photographs. Hand-crocheted doilies. An array of family photos lining the fireplace mantel.</p><p>Hannah\u2019s favorite picture was one of her grandfather taken when he was a young man recently emigrated to America. Another favorite was of her father as a youngster, less than ten years of age.</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d Sylvia instructed after settling herself in the oak rocker she loved. She took a sip of tea, then held the delicate china cup with both hands. \u201cActually, I wondered when you\u2019d come. I\u2019ve been waiting, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaiting for me?\u201d Hannah turned from the familiar photographs and met her grandmother\u2019s keen eyes.</p><p>\u201cI know you far too well not to recognize when something is bothering you.\u201d</p><p>Hannah lowered her gaze. She didn\u2019t bother to deny that she was troubled. Nor was she surprised that her grandmother had guessed. She suspected Sylvia had known her true feelings from the moment she\u2019d introduced Carl.</p><p>\u201cYou look tired, Hannah.\u201d</p><p>She was unbelievably so. But the bone weariness that drained her energy had little to do with the long hours she worked at the deli or the number of customers she served. It was a fatigue of the heart, of pretending to love Carl, of giving the impression that she was happy.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to tell me anything you don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing.\u201d Her grandmother\u2019s tone was loving and tender. \u201cJust sit with me a spell and soak in the silence. I don\u2019t know how a person can sort everything out unless they can hear themselves think.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sylvia swayed gently in the oak rocker and sipped her tea. A soft creaking noise eked up from the hardwood floor beneath the braided rug.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about Carl and me,\u201d Hannah said after a long while. She stood and walked over to the fireplace, where a gentle flame flickered over the logs. After running her hand against the top of the mantel, she turned and faced her grandmother.</p><p>\u201cI guessed all this involved Carl.\u201d</p><p>Hannah smiled to herself, appreciating Sylvia\u2019s insight. She sat on the braided rug next to her grandmother. Sylvia\u2019s hand stroked the top of Hannah\u2019s head.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been praying for you for a good many years, Hannah. Long before you were born, I asked God if He would see fit to give my son a child, and He gave us you.\u201d</p><p>It was a story Hannah had heard often. Her childless parents had longed desperately for a baby. The doctors had told them it would take a miracle.</p><p>Like Hannah in the story of Samuel, a familiar one in the Bible, her mother and family had prayed diligently for a child. Samuel\u2019s mother, like her own, had wept and pleaded with God in the temple with such anguish that Eli, the priest, had assumed she was drunk. When she spoke of her longing for a son, Eli had assured her that God had heard her prayer and that in a year\u2019s time she would have a son.</p><p>After nearly twenty years of marriage, Ruth had conceived, and the Morganstern family had rejoiced. When David learned his wife was pregnant, he\u2019d been the one to decide on his daughter\u2019s name. Hannah had been named after Elkanah\u2019s wife, whose faith had been richly rewarded.</p><p>All her life Hannah had been loved and cherished. That was what made disappointing her family so difficult.</p> <p>\u201cThrough the years, I have continued to pray for you,\u201d Sylvia went on. \u201cAs you entered your teen years, I added your husband to my list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man you would marry. It seemed to me that God in his almighty wisdom would choose an extraordinary man for you. A man of character, a man of wisdom and discernment. A man who would love you with all his heart.\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother\u2019s gentle words caused Hannah\u2019s throat to thicken with tears. \u201cI don\u2019t love Carl,\u201d she whispered brokenly.</p><p>Sylvia\u2019s hand didn\u2019t pause as she continued to stroke Hannah\u2019s crown. \u201cI realized that almost immediately. You\u2019ve met someone else, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and Grandma, he\u2019s a good man, just the way you say. I can\u2019t tell you how fortunate I feel to even know him. I love him so much that it frightens me. . . . I\u2019m so afraid I\u2019m going to lose him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe loves you?\u201d</p><p>Hannah nodded. The knowledge should have filled her with an incredible sense of wonder that a man as wonderful as Joshua would care for her.</p><p>\u201cThen why would you lose him?\u201d her grandmother questioned.</p><p>\u201cBecause of Carl.\u201d</p><p>It was as if Sylvia had forgotten Hannah were engaged to the other man. \u201cAh yes, Carl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarl\u2019s a good man,\u201d Hannah whispered. She didn\u2019t want to hurt him, either.</p><p>\u201cCarl\u2019s a fine young man, but he\u2019s not the one for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoshua is.\u201d There was no doubt in Hannah\u2019s mind about that.</p> <p>\u201cJoshua,\u201d Sylvia repeated slowly, as if testing the name on her tongue. She shook her head once and said decisively, \u201cIf you love him the way you claim, then you have nothing to fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut everyone expects me to marry Carl. You saw what happened, how we were pressured into setting a date for the wedding.\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother said nothing, which increased Hannah\u2019s guilt.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to break the engagement,\u201d Hannah said all at once, running the words together. She didn\u2019t think it was fair to tell her grandmother that Carl had recently lost his job; the fewer who knew, the better. The best way to handle it was to be diplomatic, she decided.</p><p>\u201cThis is a bad time for Carl,\u201d she offered. \u201cHe\u2019s under a lot of pressure right now. I wanted to tell him about meeting Joshua. I\u2019ve tried\u2014honest, I have\u2014but something always happens. For a long time I figured that it was too late for Joshua and me. I even tried not to see him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t have worked.\u201d</p><p>Hannah glanced up at her grandmother, wondering at the strength and conviction in the older woman\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cYou and Joshua were meant to be together,\u201d Sylvia elaborated.</p><p>Hannah rested her head against her grandmother\u2019s knee. \u201cJoshua came into the deli this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid knows him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a frequent customer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he knows good food when he tastes it.\u201d</p><p>Hannah smiled.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d Sylvia encouraged.</p><p>\u201cJoshua wanted to talk to me, but it was impossible there. I\u2019m sure he was about to suggest that we meet elsewhere\u2014we\u2019ve done it before\u2014but he didn\u2019t get the chance.</p><p>\u201cSomehow Joshua and Dad got involved in a conversation, and then Dad told him that Carl and I had set the wedding date. He actually invited Joshua to the wedding.\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother sighed heavily. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine Joshua was pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looked so hurt.\u201d That was the only way she could think to describe the anguish she\u2019d witnessed in Joshua\u2019s eyes. \u201cHe congratulated me, and before I had a chance to explain, he left the deli. I got away as soon as I could and hurried to his office, but he wasn\u2019t there and his secretary couldn\u2019t tell me when he\u2019d be back. I\u2019ve got to talk to him.\u201d She squeezed her eyes shut, berating herself silently.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have said if he had been at his office?\u201d her grandmother questioned.</p><p>\u201cI longed to explain how Carl and I had been coerced into picking a date for the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that was what he wanted to hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Hannah murmured miserably. \u201cHe wants to hear that I\u2019ve told Carl about us. He needs to know that I\u2019ve broken off the engagement, and that my family\u2019s been told that I won\u2019t be marrying Carl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy guess is that he\u2019d be willing to speak to your parents with you.\u201d</p><p>Hannah dreaded telling her parents most. She\u2019d never considered having Joshua stand with her and immediately knew that he would want to be there. He\u2019d never ask her to confront her family alone.</p><p>With an energy that had escaped her earlier, she leapt to her feet. \u201cI\u2019ve got to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoshua?\u201d her grandmother asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, Carl. I can\u2019t worry about his feelings any longer. He doesn\u2019t need me to hold his hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d Her grandmother\u2019s face beamed with pride.</p><p>\u201cJoshua is the man I love, he deserves my loyalty. As soon as I\u2019ve talked to Carl, I\u2019ll speak to Joshua.\u201d</p><p>Sylvia looked well pleased. \u201cThat, my dear, sounds like a plan.\u201d</p><p>The anger inside Roberto simmered just below the exploding point. His patience was gone, his temper unreasonable, his mood black. He\u2019d probably offended every customer he\u2019d dealt with in the last couple of days. Matters would improve drastically, he realized, if he could stop thinking about Brynn. But that seemed impossible.</p><p>He wished to hell she\u2019d leave. Pack her bags, hand in her resignation, and go back where she belonged. Because she sure as hell didn\u2019t fit in this neighborhood. A delicate, beautiful rosebud among thistles.</p><p>The only way to convince her he wanted nothing more to do with her was to shove her out of his life. His chest ached with a crippling tightness for all that he\u2019d lost. He hadn\u2019t meant to do it then and there, but she\u2019d forced his actions, coming to him the way she had.</p><p>Modesto\u2019s injuries had convinced him of the terrible risk Brynn was taking working in this neighborhood. She was an easy target. Too easy. She refused to listen to reason and defied him at every turn. Fine. She could do as she damn well pleased, but he would have no part of it. Or her.</p><p>If she wanted to sacrifice herself over a bunch of screwy, idealistic goals, so be it. But he wasn\u2019t standing by idly to watch her fall on her face. Nor would he be there to pick up the pieces.</p><p>For her own good, she had to leave this neighborhood, and she wouldn\u2019t as long as he encouraged her to remain. That was exactly what their relationship was doing.</p><p>It was over, and nothing would change his mind. Not this time. Not with Modesto in the hospital, a bullet hole in his chest, and his brother screaming with nightmares.</p><p>Roberto heard a movement behind him and glanced over his shoulder to find Emilio standing just inside the garage.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna bite my head off?\u201d Emilio asked.</p><p>\u201cThat depends on what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you doing here?\u201d Roberto threw a wrench toward the work bench. It landed with a discordant clanking sound. He never abused his tools, but then there was a first time for everything. A first time to fall in love. A first time to turn his back and run from what he wanted most.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bored,\u201d Emilio confessed. \u201cI thought it\u2019d be fun to stay home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go back to school,\u201d Roberto said without emotion. He hadn\u2019t changed his mind about education, but he was willing to agree that Brynn might have a point. For a long time he\u2019d thought Emilio would work with him at the garage. He could teach his brother, and the two of them could be partners. But Emilio didn\u2019t have the knack for working on cars. He liked people, liked being around them.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go to school,\u201d his brother confessed, walking all the way into the garage. He planted the tips of his fingers in his jeans pockets. This was the stance he chose when he had something to hide. His brother tended to be transparent about such things, and frankly, Roberto was grateful.</p><p>Unwilling to reveal he knew something was amiss, Roberto continued to work on the car, removing the carburetor from an engine. \u201cI thought you liked your classes.\u201d</p><p>Emilio shrugged. \u201cThe best are the ones Miss Cassidy teaches. She makes learning fun, but she isn\u2019t an easy teacher. Sometimes after school me and the others talk about her.\u201d</p><p>Roberto stiffened, then asked nonchalantly, \u201cWhat do you have to say?\u201d Emilio and the other boys in the class weren\u2019t blind. Brynn was as beautiful as she was naive.</p><p>\u201cShe talks about things that make a person think, about war and prejudice, and stuff like that. Just about every day she gives us a writing assignment and then has us read what we wrote and talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Emilio\u2019s eyes brightened as he spoke. \u201cWe\u2019re reading this book about Anne Frank. She was this Jewish girl, who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who Anne Frank is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d This appeared to impress Emilio. \u201cWell, Miss Cassidy asked us to pretend we were the ones in hiding. To share this compact space with another family, to live in constant fear of discovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we did, and then she had some of us read what we\u2019d written, and I was surprised, you know, by how she tied it in to what\u2019s going on in our world today. Social issues and that sort of thing. The guys and me sometimes talk about the same things we did in class. I don\u2019t do that with any of my other subjects.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good teacher, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>That did and didn\u2019t surprise Roberto. He knew Brynn was popular with the kids, but that didn\u2019t say much about her ability to teach a class.</p><p>\u201cThen go back,\u201d Roberto said as though it should be an easy decision. He never did understand Emilio\u2019s sudden desire to quit. The teenager certainly wasn\u2019t any help here at the garage, mooning around, looking miserable. Everything he\u2019d asked Emilio to do thus far, with the exception of errands, he\u2019d had to do over.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His brother\u2019s low, trembling voice caused Roberto to look up. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Emilio shrugged.</p><p>\u201cIf you like school, then go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going back,\u201d Emilio insisted with a ring of rebellion.</p> <p>Roberto frowned and gave Emilio his full attention. Something was very wrong. \u201cFirst you said you can\u2019t go back, and now you\u2019re telling me you won\u2019t? Which is it?\u201d</p><p>Emilio looked decidedly uncomfortable. \u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>Leaning against the work bench, Roberto crossed his arms. \u201cYou\u2019d better explain that.\u201d</p><p>Emilio took a short stroll around the garage. \u201cI can\u2019t go back because . . .\u201d He hesitated.</p><p>\u201cBecause why?\u201d Roberto pressed.</p><p>Emilio whirled around, his eyes flashing with open defiance. \u201cBecause I\u2019m embarrassed, that\u2019s why.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEmbarrassed about what?\u201d He hadn\u2019t a clue what his brother could possibly have done that would cause this reaction.</p><p>\u201cI made a fool of myself in front of Miss Cassidy.\u201d He admitted this between clenched teeth, as if to say that was all he was willing to admit.</p><p>Roberto snickered and shook his head. Emilio wasn\u2019t the only one to play the fool when it came to dealing with the beautiful redhead. All at once it dawned on him that Emilio might have fallen in love with her, too.</p><p>His brother seemed to read Roberto\u2019s thoughts. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d he snapped. \u201cShe\u2019s your woman, not mine.\u201d</p><p>Roberto returned to the carburetor rather than look his brother in the eye. \u201cShe\u2019s not mine, either,\u201d he said forcefully, \u201cand that\u2019s the way I want it. The less you say about it the better. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Emilio didn\u2019t say anything, but Roberto felt his brother\u2019s scrutiny. He regretted having said this much, but Emilio would have figured it out sooner or later.</p><p>\u201cNow get your butt over to school.\u201d</p><p>Emilio didn\u2019t budge. \u201cWhy is it so hellfire important for me to get an education? I thought you said it was a waste of time. What changed your mind?\u201d</p> <p>The last thing Roberto wanted was to be dragged into an argument over the pros and cons of education. \u201cYou changed my mind. I gained nothing in high school, least of all a decent education. But it\u2019s different for you. Now don\u2019t make me embarrass you further by dragging you back.\u201d</p><p>Emilio hesitated, as though he didn\u2019t know what to do. \u201cYou\u2019d do it, too.\u201d</p><p>Roberto grinned. \u201cDon\u2019t doubt it. Now get your sorry ass over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tell Miss Cassidy you forced me to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, tell her.\u201d He\u2019d rather Emilio didn\u2019t mention his name, but he wouldn\u2019t give his brother something to hold over him, either. Swallowing his pride was a small gift he could give the two people he loved most in this world. His brother would have his education, and Brynn would have the pleasure of knowing that he\u2019d changed his mind about school.</p><p>The decision made, Emilio disappeared.</p><p>Roberto heard the door slam and paused long enough to look out the window to see Emilio racing down the street, kicking up his heels in his eagerness to get back to school.</p><p>It didn\u2019t seem an hour had passed before Emilio was back. He looked more like his usual self than he had over the last couple of days, loitering around the shop, disgruntled and miserable.</p><p>\u201cI thought you went back to school,\u201d Roberto said with a scowl.</p><p>\u201cI did go back. School\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Roberto glanced at the clock above the door. Emilio was right.</p><p>\u201cA couple of the guys are waiting for me. We\u2019re going to visit Modesto. He can have company now, and we thought we\u2019d see if we could find any good-looking nurses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a message for you from Miss Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>Roberto steeled himself. He didn\u2019t want to play any games, notes back and forth, that sort of thing. It was over, and the sooner she accepted it, the better. \u201cI don\u2019t want it,\u201d he said forcefully.</p><p>\u201cIt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe note or whatever it is she gave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t give me anything. She just wanted me to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said stiffly, \u201ctell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>Emilio\u2019s look told him the answer to that should have been obvious. \u201cFor me coming back to school. I told her you were the one who insisted I did, and she got all teary-eyed and asked me to tell you she appreciated that.\u201d</p><p>The pain in Roberto\u2019s chest tightened. \u201cYou\u2019ve told me, now get out of here. I\u2019ve got work to do.\u201d</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>Jenny didn\u2019t know what to think about Trey. He hadn\u2019t been himself for nearly two days. She\u2019d spent as much time with him as her schedule would allow, but that was only an hour or two each day. Perhaps he was disappointed in her.</p><p>She\u2019d taken him to all the tourist spots. Only recently they\u2019d been up to the top of the World Trade Center and to the United Nations building.</p><p>By nature Trey was a man of few words, but he\u2019d been less communicative than usual the last couple of days. That worried her.</p><p>\u201cAre there any other sights you want to see?\u201d Jenny asked as they strolled lazily through Central Park, feeding the birds.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say that there are,\u201d Trey said, tossing birdseed to a flock of people-friendly pigeons. Others flew over instantly from a variety of directions, looking for a handout. Their wings made a ruffling sound that carried with the wind.</p><p>Jenny tossed a fistful of seeds and laughed at the way the silver birds battled over the goodies.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking maybe we could go to dinner this evening,\u201d Trey said unexpectedly.</p><p>\u201cDinner,\u201d Jenny repeated. She\u2019d promised Michelle they would have their own small Christmas that evening, since her friend would soon be heading home for the holidays. Jenny\u2019s schedule at the restaurant had changed a number of times with other girls needing time away. She\u2019d worked all the extra hours she could. The only night she\u2019d been free in nearly two weeks had been the evening of the Christmas potluck. Surely Michelle would understand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to check with Michelle first.\u201d She didn\u2019t tell Trey the reason, because another, more intrusive thought immediately came to mind.</p><p>Trey was going back to Montana.</p><p>Dinner would be his way of telling her good-bye. An empty feeling, one that chilled her heart, came so swiftly it felt as if someone had slapped her viciously across the back.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s your flight?\u201d she asked point-blank.</p><p>Trey didn\u2019t answer her right away, and she thought he might not have heard her. \u201cTwo days\u2019 time.\u201d</p><p>So she was right.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay any longer, Jenny. I\u2019d like to, but I\u2019ve got a herd of cattle to worry about, and I can\u2019t leave Pete alone much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d If anyone could appreciate his need to return, it was she. After all, she was a rancher\u2019s daughter. That Trey had stayed in New York this long was something of a surprise. Just when she was growing accustomed to having him with her. Just when her heart felt whole again. He was going to leave her. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll be able to visit again soon,\u201d she said, fighting to disguise the ache in her heart. Next time. The only way she could deal with his leaving was to look into the future and the promise of his return.</p><p>The birdseed gone, Jenny experienced the need to sit down. She walked over and sank onto a park bench.</p><p>Trey joined her. \u201cWhen will you be able to talk to Michelle?\u201d</p><p>For a moment Jenny didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. \u201cSoon,\u201d she said, and then remembered Trey had asked her to dinner. A fond farewell dinner. A \u201cgee, but it\u2019s been swell\u201d good-bye dinner.</p><p>Her stomach clenched, then tied itself into a knot that tightened with each breath. As the ache intensified, Jenny realized how much she wanted Trey to stay. How much she needed him in her life.</p><p>Sitting on the edge of the park bench, her hands buried deep in her coat pockets, Jenny tried to compose herself, fearing she\u2019d embarrass them both by breaking into tears.</p><p>\u201cJenny\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichelle\u2019s at the apartment now. We can go ask her,\u201d she suggested cheerfully. That she could fool Trey into thinking nothing was amiss was a testament to how truly talented an actress she was.</p><p>\u201cMichelle\u2019s there now?\u201d</p><p>Jenny checked her watch. \u201cIf not, she will be any minute. Why don\u2019t we go back to the apartment? It\u2019s about lunchtime anyway. I can fix you a sandwich. I make an excellent peanut butter and jelly.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her right away. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, rushing to her feet as though tickled pink to return to her small, cramped apartment and slap together two pieces of bread.</p><p>It didn\u2019t escape Jenny\u2019s notice that Trey didn\u2019t speak a single word on the way home. Perhaps it was the subway, which she knew confused him; it had her in the beginning, too, but now she was a pro when it came to finding her way around the city. Of course she didn\u2019t take it at night, and never when she was alone.</p><p>She unlocked the apartment door and stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like Michelle\u2019s back,\u201d Trey murmured.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be here any time,\u201d Jenny said confidently. Now that she was home, in familiar surroundings, she didn\u2019t know how much longer she\u2019d be able to keep up the pretense. The tightening, empty feeling in the pit of her stomach had spread to her heart and her throat. Tears threatened to spill down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cMake yourself comfortable and I\u2019ll get you a sandwich,\u201d she said, eager for an excuse to leave him. She needed this time to compose herself, to figure out how she was going to see him off and do it with a smile. No one was that good an actress.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be soon enough,\u201d she said, hoping she sounded enthusiastic. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want it, I\u2019ll eat it later.\u201d She walked into the kitchen and braced her hands against the kitchen sink and closed her eyes. Inhaling deep breaths didn\u2019t seem to help.</p><p>Trey was going back to Montana, where he belonged\u2014where she belonged, too. Only she was too proud to admit it, too stubborn to throw in the towel. For three years she\u2019d given all that she had, looking for a chance to prove herself. All that effort, all her talent, had gotten her was a job as a singing waitress in a two-star restaurant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leaning forward, she propped her elbows on the kitchen counter and pushed the hair away from her forehead. She tried taking in short breaths, followed by deep ones. Nothing seemed to help.</p><p>Damn it all, she was going to cry. Trey would see, and then he\u2019d want to know what was wrong. She didn\u2019t know what she would tell him.</p><p>If Michelle came home, perhaps her friend could distract him until Jenny had collected herself.</p><p>She felt the first tears slip from the corners of her eyes. She\u2019d held them back for so long that it was as if a dam had burst inside her. The tears marked more than Trey\u2019s return home. They represented the frustration, the disappointment, of three hard years of her life. Three long, fruitless years.</p> <p>\u201cJenny, is something wrong?\u201d Trey stood directly behind her. She could feel the warmth of his body so close to her own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she answered in a strained voice. She straightened, wiped the telltale moisture from her face, and reached toward the bread box.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound fine. Turn around.\u201d His hand fell gently on her shoulder.</p><p>She might have been able to pull it off if he hadn\u2019t been so tender with her. The moment he touched her, she knew she was lost. The sob was a painful tightening in her chest that worked its way up to her throat.</p><p>She turned in his arms and let his torso muffle her cry. Her shoulders shook as he wrapped her in his embrace.</p> <p>\u201cJenny, my heaven, what is it?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him; she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>His hand stroked her hair, and Jenny was confident he had no idea what to do with her. She feared her tears embarrassed him as much as they did her.</p><p>\u201cOh my,\u201d she said, breaking away from him. She smeared the traces of tears away from her cheeks and from some hidden reserve of strength offered him an apologetic smile. \u201cI wonder what that was all about.\u201d</p><p>Trey didn\u2019t respond. Instead he tucked his finger beneath her chin and lowered his mouth to hers. They\u2019d kissed before, and the hot sensation between them had shocked Jenny. He kissed her again and again, each kiss gaining in intensity and momentum until she was struggling for control.</p><p>\u201cJenny, sweet Jenny,\u201d he whispered, his voice husky and low. \u201cI don\u2019t think you know what kissing you does to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do know, because you do the same thing to me.\u201d She ran her tongue along the underside of his jaw and felt his body tense against hers. She\u2019d never experienced such a powerful sense of control over a man.</p><p>He cupped her face between his hands for another deep, breath-stealing kiss.</p><p>\u201cTell me why you were crying,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Jenny closed her eyes. Her hands bit into the material of his shirt, her hold so tight that her fingers lost feeling. \u201cI . . . I\u2019m going to miss you, Trey.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened, and she wondered if she\u2019d said something wrong. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry,\u201d she hurried to assure him. \u201cI\u2019m a big girl, really.\u201d</p><p>He led her into the living room and sat her down in the chair, then he started moving around as though he needed to sit himself but couldn\u2019t find an available seat.</p><p>\u201cTrey?\u201d</p><p>He held out his hand. \u201cI\u2019ve got something to ask you. I was going to wait until tonight at dinner, but now seems as good a time as any.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAsk me what?\u201d</p><p>He looked decidedly uncomfortable. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how to do this. I\u2019ve never done it before, and hell\u201d\u2014he paused and dragged a deep breath through his lungs\u2014\u201cI damn well never plan to do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never done what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPropose,\u201d he snapped, then seemed to realize what he\u2019d said. He ceased his roaming and stood directly in front of her. \u201cI love you, Jenny Lancaster. I\u2019ve loved you from the time you were fifteen years old. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen? But you never let on . . . you never told me.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cIf I\u2019d said anything, your father would have had me arrested, as well he should have. I never wanted you to leave Montana, but you deserved your chance. You\u2019ve had it, and now it\u2019s time to come home. With me, with the promise you\u2019ll be my wife.\u201d His eyes grew dark and serious as he got down on one knee in front of her. \u201cCome home with me, Jenny. Marry me, and mother my children. I don\u2019t have a lot to offer you, except a heart that will always be yours.\u201d</p><p>Jenny was too stunned to respond. She pressed her hand over her mouth and battled down a fresh batch of emotion.</p><p>The front door opened and Trey stood up abruptly and, irritated, glanced over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHello, everyone,\u201d Michelle greeted as she whirled into the room like a prairie dust storm. She hesitated and looked from Trey and Jenny. \u201cI\u2019m not disrupting anything, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Trey answered before Jenny could.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry. Do you want me to discreetly disappear for a few moments?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be much appreciated.\u201d Again it was Trey who responded.</p><p>Michelle had just started to tiptoe from the room when the telephone rang. \u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d she said, and then tossed Trey an apologetic look. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for a call all week.\u201d</p><p>Trey rubbed his hand along the back of his neck and gave her an impatient nod.</p><p>Michelle answered on the second ring, and her gaze swiveled automatically toward Jenny. She placed her hand over the mouthpiece. \u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Jenny asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Irene.\u201d</p><p>Jenny leapt off the sofa and hurried to the phone. \u201cIrene,\u201d she said eagerly, unable to hide her delight. When her agent phoned it was generally with good news.</p><p>\u201cJenny.\u201d Irene sounded excited. \u201cI just got off the phone with John Peterman. He\u2019s wants you for the second lead in his new play. This is it, kiddo. All your hard work has finally paid off. We couldn\u2019t ask for better money or better terms. You\u2019re on your way now.\u201d</p><p>Dumbstruck, Jenny listened while Irene relayed the details of her contract. When her agent had finished, Jenny replaced the receiver and turned to Michelle, who stood beside her expectantly.</p><p>\u201cI got the second lead,\u201d she whispered, her voice revealing the extent of her shock. \u201cJohn Peterman wants me.\u201d</p><p>Michelle let out a wild scream and hugged her enthusiastically. Then the two of them did a dance about the room, laughing, crying, their joy spilling over like champagne poured too fast from the bottle.</p><p>A good five minutes passed before Jenny remembered Trey, and then she couldn\u2019t find him.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d he go?\u201d Jenny asked her roommate.</p><p>Michelle gave her a blank look. \u201cI don\u2019t know. He must have left.\u201d</p><p>The minute Brynn walked into the school she knew something was very wrong. One of the secretaries sat at her desk, weeping silently. A handful of teachers stood in the corner of the office, talking in whispers. The tension in the room was thick enough to slice and butter.</p><p>Not knowing what was wrong, Brynn walked over to her cubicle and cleared out the space. As she suspected, there were a number of printed sheets detailing information about the winter break. The teachers\u2019 Christmas party was scheduled for that evening. Since her surname began with a C, she was responsible for supplying a main dish. Another paper detailed the period schedule for the last day.</p><p>Brynn slipped the papers into her bag. A white envelope fluttered from her space and landed on the floor. It was addressed to her personally, and she wondered who had put it there. On closer inspection, she realized the handwriting was familiar. It took a moment to recognize it was from Mike Glasser.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear?\u201d Doug Keast asked as he reached for his own papers.</p><p>\u201cHear about what?\u201d Brynn had never been particularly fond of Doug. Not since the day he\u2019d been so eager to have Emilio hauled off to the office. She had no problem with the school\u2019s policy regarding fighting, but she questioned the other teacher\u2019s attitude. It seemed Doug had welcomed the opportunity to see Emilio expelled.</p><p>\u201cMike Glasser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe blew his brains out.\u201d Doug pointed his finger to his temple and pulled an imaginary trigger. \u201cHis mother found him late yesterday afternoon.\u201d Doug hesitated. \u201cSay, isn\u2019t he one of the kids in your program?\u201d</p><p>Mike, dead? A suicide? It was as if Doug had pulled the floor out from under her. The information came at her like a fist in the dark.</p><p>Brynn gasped and slumped against the wall. It demanded every ounce of strength she possessed to remain upright. Involuntarily she started to hyperventilate, and she reached out and grabbed hold of the back of a chair.</p><p>\u201cBrynn?\u201d Doug\u2019s arm came around her. \u201cHere, sit down. Do you need something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater. Could you please get me a glass of water?\u201d A shocking, total numbness shrouded her.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Listen, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Doug steered her to a table and sat her down. \u201cI guess I shouldn\u2019t have told you like that.\u201d His voice was full of apology.</p><p>Brynn was too numb to respond.</p><p>Dead. Mike, the young man she\u2019d tried so hard to reach, was dead. There would be no more tomorrows. No dreams for Mike. No future.</p><p>The letter. Mike had written her a letter. A suicide note. No. No, please, please no. Had he written it to her as a desperate cry for help? Dear God, please no. She hadn\u2019t collected her messages in two days.</p><p>Her hands shook so badly that Brynn was barely able to retrieve the long white envelope from inside her bag. She ripped it open and pulled out a single sheet.</p><p>Miss Cassidy,</p><p>By the time you read this, I\u2019ll be dead. I\u2019m not going to go into the reasons why I\u2019m doing this because that wouldn\u2019t solve anything. For me death is the only solution. This is what I want. Life is simply too fucking painful.</p><p>I imagine you\u2019re wondering why I\u2019m writing you.</p><p>There\u2019s someone I care about, and she\u2019s going to take this hard. I don\u2019t know anyone who can help Suzie through this, except maybe you.</p><p>Suzie\u2019s the best thing that ever happened to me, and I love her. She tried to help me, but she couldn\u2019t. No one could.</p><p>My dad killed himself when I was a kid. I used to get upset about it, but now I understand why he did it. Dying is easier than living.</p><p>Unable to continue because her eyes had blurred with tears, Brynn paused long enough to search for a tissue, then returned to Mike\u2019s letter.</p><p>You don\u2019t owe me any favors, but I know you like Suzie.</p><p>Talk to her for me, would you? Tell her I\u2019m sorry. Tell her . . . Shit, you\u2019ll know what to say. It isn\u2019t her fault. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault. Not Suzie\u2019s. Not yours. Not mine. It\u2019s better this way for everyone.</p><p>I know I don\u2019t have any right to lay this on you, but there\u2019s no one else I trust. If you would, I\u2019d appreciate it if you said something to my mother, too. You\u2019re good with words and you\u2019ll know what to tell her.</p><p>Since this is the last thing I\u2019ll ever write, there\u2019s something I\u2019d like to know. I wish I could have traded places with Anne Frank. She wanted to live, when all I could think about was dying. You\u2019re a good teacher, Miss Cassidy. You made me care. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mike</p><p>Doug Keast returned with a paper cup filled with water. Brynn thanked him with a brisk nod as she folded the letter and placed it back inside the envelope.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Brynn nodded. She wanted nothing more to do with Doug Keast and was grateful when the first bell rang.</p> <p>\u201cBrynn,\u201d her fellow teacher pressed, \u201cdo you want me to call someone? You don\u2019t look so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d But she wouldn\u2019t be. It would be a long while before she would feel right again. Brynn couldn\u2019t keep from thinking that she should have known something was wrong. She should have been able to reach Mike. Should have realized the depth of his despair.</p><p>And Suzie. Poor Suzie. Brynn was certain the teenager had never told Mike she was pregnant. Suzie had loved him and tried to protect him. Mike had loved her enough to ask Brynn to help her through her grief. Brynn didn\u2019t know what she could possibly say that would comfort Suzie and Mike\u2019s mother.</p><p>By some miracle, she made it through the morning, teaching by rote. Not everyone had heard about Mike\u2019s death, but then only a handful of her morning students knew him.</p><p>At lunchtime, still numb, still in shock, Brynn returned to the office to ask about Suzie Chang. As she suspected, Suzie was absent. She wrote down Suzie\u2019s home address, tucked it inside her pocket, and returned to her classroom.</p> <p>Her heart ached. Her body ached, and she wondered if she would emotionally survive this day. The burden of explaining and comforting seemed beyond her.</p><p>When it was time for her afternoon class, Brynn sat at her desk. One by one, her students paraded single file past her. Mike\u2019s desk in the center of the room sat empty. Brynn found she couldn\u2019t look at it without experiencing a tremendous sense of loss.</p><p>Everyone appeared to be watching her, waiting for her to say something. Brynn walked to the front of the room. The silence was deafening.</p><p>\u201cBy now I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all heard about Mike,\u201d she said, and was shocked at how thin her voice had become. She struggled with her composure. \u201cTalking about it might do us all some good. Perhaps you can help me understand why Mike would take his own life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s stupid,\u201d Pearl Washington said.</p><p>\u201cBut Mike wasn\u2019t stupid,\u201d Brynn insisted. \u201cWhen I could get him to express his feelings, I found his essays to be full of insight.\u201d She realized as she spoke how dark his writing was, how bleakly he saw the world. Then and now. Guilt swamped her senses. She should have seen it coming, should have realized how much pain he was in.</p> <p>\u201cHe should have told someone,\u201d Emilio suggested.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Brynn asked. \u201cTold them what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t exactly his friends,\u201d Yolanda reminded everyone sadly.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t want no friends,\u201d Denzil insisted.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so he wasn\u2019t Mr. Personality, but he wasn\u2019t so bad, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sorry he\u2019s dead?\u201d Brynn asked.</p><p>A chorus of regrets chimed back, and Brynn knew that the class was suffering just as she was. Mike had asked her to talk to Suzie, to help Suzie. What he hadn\u2019t realized was that they were all going to need help dealing with his death.</p><p>\u201cHe never let on, you know?\u201d someone complained.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he knew how to share his pain,\u201d Brynn suggested.</p><p>Yolanda started to cry. \u201cIt makes me mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does?\u201d Brynn questioned, struggling not to weep herself.</p><p>\u201cThat he didn\u2019t give any of us a chance to tell him goodbye. When Modesto was shot it was bad, but this is worse because I feel like there was something I should have done, something I should have said. Maybe if I\u2019d been friendlier, it would have helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us had a clue how much emotional pain Mike was in,\u201d Brynn told them solemnly. \u201cDeath was obviously something Mike had been entertaining for a long time. It was wrong, and now each one of us is left with recriminations.\u201d</p><p>Brynn paused at the sharp pain in her chest. \u201cI can\u2019t blame Mike, but I wish I\u2019d known how much he was hurting. I might have been able to help him. Like Yolanda said, we never got a chance to say good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to get in his face and make him listen to reason,\u201d one of the girls shouted. \u201cHe\u2019s hurt so many people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was in pain himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can,\u201d Brynn whispered.</p><p>\u201cBut how?\u201d Denzil asked. \u201cIt isn\u2019t like we can write him a letter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t we?\u201d Brynn asked, remembering how much writing had helped her deal with the death of her beloved grandmother five years earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s true Mike won\u2019t be reading it, but writing Mike might help each of us deal with the shock of what he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Cassidy\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Binders opened and spiral notebooks appeared as her students automatically reached for a fresh piece of paper. They did this without Brynn so much as asking.</p><p>The remainder of the time was spent writing Mike. Brynn wrote her own letter and found herself struggling to hold in the emotion as she placed feelings of doubt on the page. When she glanced up, she found several of her students were weeping.</p><p>Afterward, those who were willing read their letters aloud.</p><p>Emilio volunteered first. Looking shaken but determined, he faced the class. \u201cMike, don\u2019t do it, man. Don\u2019t do it.\u201d Then he slid back onto his seat.</p><p>Pearl stood beside her desk. \u201cWhy do I hurt so bad? I barely knew you, and yet I feel some responsibility for your death. You sat three desks away from me. Three desks and you couldn\u2019t reach that far? Three desks and I couldn\u2019t see your pain? I\u2019m sorry, Mike. Forgive me.\u201d</p><p>Yolanda, tears streaming down her face, volunteered next. \u201cThank you, Mike, for what you taught me. I wasn\u2019t your friend, but I wish I had been. I never took the time to talk to you. But you touched my life. Never again will I sit in a classroom and not look around me. I wish I\u2019d known how much pain you were in. I\u2019d like to think you would have told me had I asked. Only I never asked. Next time will be different. Next time I\u2019m going to look.\u201d</p><p>When the bell rang her class filed out of the room with little of the enthusiasm they generally showed at the end of a day.</p><p>\u201cWill you find out about Mike\u2019s funeral?\u201d Emilio asked.</p><p>The other kids stopped and waited for Brynn to respond.</p><p>\u201cWe want to know,\u201d Yolanda said.</p><p>\u201cI think it would help if we went.\u201d</p><p>There was a chorus of agreement.</p><p>\u201cYou were the only friends Mike had,\u201d Brynn said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bad we didn\u2019t do a better job of it,\u201d Yolanda said just loudly enough for Brynn to hear.</p><p>Brynn left the school as soon as she could. She had Suzie\u2019s address with her and walked over to the teenager\u2019s apartment. The girl\u2019s mother greeted her at the door and was painfully polite as she ushered Brynn into the living room.</p><p>\u201cIs Suzie home?\u201d Brynn asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. She with Mike\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>Brynn studied the delicate Chinese woman who struggled with English. \u201cMy daughter has torn heart.\u201d</p><p>Brynn placed her hand over her own heart. It did indeed feel as if it had been torn. \u201cPlease tell Suzie that I\u2019m looking for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Thank you very much to coming.\u201d Her English was heavily accented and barely understandable.</p><p>Before she left, Brynn placed her hand on the other woman\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSuzie is a wonderful girl. I feel honored to have been the teacher of such a fine student.\u201d</p><p>The delicate woman\u2019s eyes avoided Brynn\u2019s, but she thought she might have detected a smile.</p><p>When Brynn arrived at Mike\u2019s, his mother was at the funeral home, making the arrangements for her son\u2019s burial. Brynn left feeling as if she\u2019d failed everyone. Mike. Suzie. His mother. Her students. Herself.</p><p>Her apartment was cold and bleak. She walked inside and stood in the dark, feeling as though she carried the burden of the world on her shoulders. With a heavy heart, she turned on the light switch and walked over to her desk.</p><p>It might have helped her had she been able to cry, but there were no tears left inside her. With a steady, sure hand, she wrote out her letter of resignation to give to Mr. Whalen in the morning. When school resumed after the first of the year, she wouldn\u2019t be there.</p><p>Roberto was right, and had been from the first, she realized. She didn\u2019t belong here. She\u2019d failed Mike, but most of all she\u2019d failed herself.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t actually going to quit, is she?\u201d Mercy asked.</p><p>Shirley stood with her hand planted protectively over Brynn\u2019s shoulder. Mercy knew that her friend had been with her charge from the moment Brynn had learned about Mike\u2019s suicide.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened with Mike wasn\u2019t her fault.\u201d Mercy wished there was something she could do. Poor Shirley was at a loss as to know how to help.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Brynn leaned forward and pressed her forehead against her folded arms.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there something we can do for you?\u201d Mercy asked.</p><p>Shirley shook her head.</p><p>It was then that Mercy realized her friend was weeping. \u201cOh, Shirley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the other angel said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I can\u2019t bear to see Brynn feeling this defeated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen?\u201d</p><p>Shirley rubbed her hand under her nose. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Gabriel\u2019s the one who can tell us that. But . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Mercy prodded.</p><p>\u201cI think it might be best if Brynn returned to Rhode Island.\u201d</p><p>Mercy was shocked. \u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe cares too much. If she\u2019d had a more experienced angel assigned to help her . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame yourself,\u201d Mercy cried, outraged at the suggestion.</p><p>\u201cShe needs Roberto,\u201d Shirley added.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get him,\u201d Mercy suggested. There were ways of dealing with stubborn men, and she wasn\u2019t opposed to using them. If Roberto Alcantara thought that he could trample over this sweet young woman\u2019s heart, well, there was a thing or two Mercy could teach that man. She\u2019d take a great deal of pleasure in doing it, too.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Shirley said with surprising strength. \u201cLeave Roberto out of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has what he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure of that?\u201d the strong male voice spoke from behind them.</p><p>\u201cGabriel.\u201d Mercy was quick to jump to attention.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Jenny?\u201d the archangel asked her.</p><p>Mercy brightened. \u201cGreat. At least she was the last time I checked. She was chosen for a major role in a new musical. It\u2019s the chance of a lifetime. She couldn\u2019t be more thrilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d</p><p>Mercy hesitated. This sounded like one of those trick questions. \u201cI . . . I . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Trey? The last I heard he\u2019d disappeared, and Jenny was looking for him. He\u2019d checked out of the hotel by the time she arrived.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTrey, well, that is a bit unfortunate.\u201d Mercy did feel bad about the young man who\u2019d set his heart on loving Jenny all these years. \u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone?\u201d Gabriel frowned, and when he did, he was something fierce to behold.</p><p>Mercy edged closer to her friend. \u201cYes, he left New York. He had a little trouble changing his airplane ticket, but managed to catch an earlier flight.\u201d</p><p>Brynn\u2019s doorbell chimed, and she straightened and wiped the tears from her face.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s coming?\u201d Shirley directed the question to Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cSuzie Chang,\u201d he answered. \u201cApparently there is a letter Brynn needs to share with the girl.\u201d</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>Talking to Carl proved to be so much more difficult than Hannah had thought it would be. She\u2019d waited all day for him, practiced in her mind how to break the news as gently as possible.</p><p>She\u2019d left her grandmother\u2019s filled with conviction. In the time since, her clear purpose had become clouded with the time-honored traditions of duty and honor.</p> <p>\u201cI know you\u2019re wondering why I asked to see you,\u201d Hannah said as she brought Carl a cup of tea and set it on the table in the family kitchen. She was nervous, and the hot liquid sloshed over the edges of the cup.</p><p>Hannah didn\u2019t worry that her parents would interrupt them. Her family seemed to think it was important that Hannah and Carl have time together alone, and for once Hannah was grateful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to talk to you, too,\u201d Carl said, smiling broadly. He looked happy, more so than she could remember in a long while. She suspected the situation with the school had been cleared up, and she was pleased for his sake.</p><p>\u201cMy father had a go-round with the school headmaster himself,\u201d Carl said, gloating a little.</p><p>So she was right.</p><p>\u201cI have my job back, Hannah, and if anyone\u2019s position is in jeopardy, it\u2019s Hiram Stienfield\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more pleased,\u201d she said, but before she could relay her own, less welcome news, Carl continued.</p><p>\u201cAs you might guess, my mind is greatly relieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, and now . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can seriously start planning for our wedding,\u201d he finished for her.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, that was what I wanted to talk to you about. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I agree June is an excellent time of year, but personally I\u2019d prefer May.\u201d Once again Carl wouldn\u2019t allow her to continue.</p><p>\u201cCarl, would you please listen to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute. There are a number of reasons I prefer May.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCarl!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s birthday is in May, and then there\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day. I\u2019ve always found it convenient to cluster certain dates together whenever possible. It helps to keep track, and if we\u2019re going to need to buy . . .\u201d He stopped abruptly when Hannah stood up.</p><p>She walked over to the stove. Now she understood what it was about Carl that had always disturbed her. He refused to listen.</p><p>\u201cHannah?\u201d he asked gently. \u201cYou\u2019re upset, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said between gritted teeth, unwilling to hide it.</p><p>\u201cYour heart\u2019s set on June, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said forcefully, and whirled around. \u201cI\u2019m not going to marry you.\u201d There, she\u2019d said it, but in far less diplomatic terms than she\u2019d wanted.</p><p>A stunned, disbelieving silence followed. At last she\u2019d found a way to capture his attention.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re honestly breaking our engagement?\u201d</p><p>He seemed to need confirmation. \u201cYes,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>He scratched the side of his head. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s a bit drastic, considering that I\u2019m willing to give up the May date? I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m a reasonable man. If you don\u2019t want the wedding in May, why don\u2019t you just say so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want the wedding in May or June or any other month of the year.\u201d She folded her arms and released a deep sigh of frustration. \u201cThis is the crux of the problem between us. You don\u2019t hear me. I\u2019m trying to tell you something important, and either you don\u2019t care or you\u2019ve already got your mind made up.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cI don\u2019t see it that way.\u201d</p><p>Hannah had never intended for them to discuss their basic personality differences. \u201cI want to break the engagement, Carl. I deeply regret hurting you, but I\u2019m fairly certain you aren\u2019t in love with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d he snapped. \u201cOf course I love you. I think you\u2019re wonderful. You\u2019ll make me a good wife, you\u2019re supportive and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing it again,\u201d she cried, clenching her fists at her sides. Hannah so seldom raised her voice that it shocked even her.</p><p>Carl looked genuinely baffled. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Hannah, listen, tell me whatever it is that you find offensive. I can change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course it matters. I realize that marriage is an important step and you\u2019re bound to have second thoughts, every woman does. Now it\u2019s true,\u201d he said, and raised his right hand with a dismissive gesture, \u201cthat I\u2019ve been wrapped up in my own problems of late. I haven\u2019t paid you nearly enough attention, have I? Naturally you\u2019re feeling short-changed in the romance department, and frankly I don\u2019t blame you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarl,\u201d she whispered, \u201cyou don\u2019t love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. I asked you to marry me, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered, her patience wearing paper thin. \u201cLet\u2019s try this from a different angle. I can\u2019t marry you, Carl, because I don\u2019t love you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. The man had the nerve to actually laugh aloud.</p><p>Dumbfounded, all Hannah could do was stare at him.</p><p>\u201cOf course you love me,\u201d he countered, sounding relieved. He placed his hand on his chest as if to restrain the bubbling amusement welling up inside him. \u201cHannah, these doubts of yours are only natural. I had them, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOccasionally,\u201d he was willing to admit. \u201cBut I\u2019ve worked through those feelings, and given time, you will, too.\u201d</p><p>Hannah had hoped that she could talk to Carl without telling him about Joshua. It was one thing to break the engagement and something else entirely to mention she\u2019d fallen in love with another man. She\u2019d hoped to spare Carl that.</p><p>\u201cThe problem as I see it,\u201d Carl said, talking to her as he would one of his students, \u201cis that people are rarely willing to see through their difficulties. Our society is caught up in fast-food restaurants, \u2018pay later\u2019 mentality, and instant gratification. My dear Hannah, what you\u2019re feeling isn\u2019t so difficult to understand. But we\u2019ve made a commitment to each other, and we can\u2019t treat it lightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarl, I\u2019m terminating our engagement.\u201d She couldn\u2019t say it any plainer than that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s times such as these that we need to hold on to each other instead of letting go of the most important relationship of our lives.\u201d</p><p>Hannah\u2019s heart was pounding so hard and fast, it felt as though her ribs were about to break. \u201cI\u2019ve met someone else,\u201d she said forcefully.</p><p>Her words stopped Carl cold. His eyes narrowed. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure. Tell me his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it matter what his name is?\u201d she demanded. \u201cI love him and he loves me.\u201d</p><p>Looking completely taken aback, Carl pulled out a kitchen chair and slumped onto it.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, Carl, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot care?\u201d he cried as though her comment had outraged him. \u201cOf course I care. Some man, some stranger, has stolen my bride, and you seem to think that it really shouldn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Hannah knew it was his ego speaking and was sorrier than she could say. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking to blame anyone, blame me,\u201d she told him gently. \u201cI never intended to tell you about him, but then I couldn\u2019t make you listen, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>His head jerked up. \u201cYou weren\u2019t going to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I wanted to do was break the engagement, but you refused to believe me . . . you weren\u2019t hearing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. I heard every word you said.\u201d</p><p>Hannah wasn\u2019t going to get into an argument with him, but this was too much. \u201cYou keep discounting me, offering excuses and reasons for my wanting to call off the engagement. You\u2019ve given me no option but to tell you about Joshua.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoshua . . .\u201d He repeated the name as if he were reading it off a post office poster.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m genuinely sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious? This isn\u2019t some stupid joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t marry you, Carl, nor can I go on pretending I love you.\u201d</p><p>The silence that followed fell like a butcher\u2019s cleaver into the middle of the room.</p><p>Carl reached for his jacket, swinging it over his shoulders like a shawl in his rush to get away from her. \u201cDo your parents know?\u201d</p><p>Hannah hesitated. \u201cThey will soon enough.\u201d</p><p>He walked toward the stairway, his steps abrupt and urgent. \u201cIf this other man is who you love, then all I can say is you\u2019re welcome to him. Just don\u2019t come crying to me when you\u2019ve regained your senses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoshua isn\u2019t going to break my heart,\u201d she assured him softly. \u201cI realize this is painful, Carl, but I\u2019d like it if we could be friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends?\u201d he echoed as though it were a ridiculous suggestion. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding. Frankly, Hannah, I doubt that I\u2019ll ever want to see you again.\u201d Having said that, he stormed out of the apartment, slamming the door behind him. The pictures on the walls shook with the force of his exit.</p><p>\u201cHannah?\u201d A moment later her father called from the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, hoping she sounded calm and assured.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right between you and Carl?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate, and the relief in her voice was evident. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Dad, everything\u2019s the way it should be.\u201d</p><p>There came a time in every man\u2019s life when he had to admit he\u2019d made a mistake, learn from it, and move forward. Joshua had reached that point the afternoon he\u2019d heard Hannah\u2019s father invite him to his daughter\u2019s wedding to another man.</p><p>Even now he couldn\u2019t find it in his heart to be angry with Hannah. Her inability to break her engagement highlighted what had attracted her to him. She was loyal to a fault, caring, and tenderhearted. Family took priority.</p><p>A part of him would always love her, he realized. Knowing her for this short period had blessed his life, but now it was time to own up to a few home truths.</p><p>First off, his love was hurting her. Because of the tenderness he held for Hannah, he couldn\u2019t continue to make her miserable. The truth was, he\u2019d found her too late. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His decision made, Joshua had hoped to experience some sort of emotional release, but he didn\u2019t. If anything, he felt considerably worse. He\u2019d stewed and fretted, doubted and reasoned, until he was blue with the effort. Nothing would ever change. Hannah loved him, but it went against the very grain of her being to defy and disappoint her family.</p><p>The snowstorm that had been predicted for that afternoon had already darkened the sky. Another night of sitting home alone, thinking about Hannah, would solve nothing.</p><p>Unfortunately all his favorite escapes had been ruined. He couldn\u2019t walk past Rockefeller Center now and not remember the time he and Hannah had skated together. Nor could he forget how good she\u2019d felt in his arms.</p><p>This was the real problem: he couldn\u2019t forget.</p> <p>The time had come to seek greener pastures, and he had just the woman in mind. He reached for the phone and dialed Carol\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cHannah,\u201d her mother called to her from the hallway. \u201cYour father and I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Hannah opened her bedroom door, her coat draped over her arm.</p><p>Ruth\u2019s eyes widened with distress. \u201cYou\u2019re not going out, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>Ruth hesitated and looked to her husband.</p><p>\u201cDid you need me to get you something?\u201d Hannah asked, then added, \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. . . . I just received a call from Carl\u2019s mother. Is it true, honey, have you broken the engagement with Carl?\u201d</p><p>Hannah should have realized something like this would happen. Carl had gone directly to his family and listed her sins. Hannah regretted that she hadn\u2019t prepared her parents for the news, but she\u2019d been hoping to confront them with Joshua at her side.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t love Carl,\u201d she told her mother gently. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mom, I know how much you and Dad like him, but I don\u2019t feel the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone else?\u201d her mother questioned, her voice revealing the depth of her disbelief. \u201cHelen seems to think you\u2019ve been seeing another man on the sly, without any of us knowing. I assured her that couldn\u2019t possibly be true.\u201d</p> <p>David Morganstern stood behind his wife, his hand on Ruth\u2019s shoulder. His eyes, dark and inquisitive, rested on his daughter.</p><p>\u201cHis name\u2019s Joshua Shadduck,\u201d she admitted. \u201cHe\u2019s an attorney.\u201d</p><p>Her mother gasped softly and covered her mouth with her hand. Hannah wasn\u2019t sure if this was because she\u2019d admitted to dating someone while engaged to Carl or because Joshua was an attorney.</p><p>Her father frowned. \u201cDidn\u2019t I recently meet this young man?\u201d</p><p>Ashamed that she\u2019d deceived them both, Hannah lowered her gaze. \u201cYes. He was in the deli.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you have fallen in love with him?\u201d her mother asked, her voice raised with disbelief. \u201cHow could you hurt Carl like this? He\u2019s such a good man. We couldn\u2019t ask for a better husband for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoshua will make me a good husband, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forbid you from seeing this Joshua again,\u201d her father said sternly.</p> <p>\u201cDaddy, I\u2019ve never defied you. I\u2019ve always done what you\u2019ve asked, but I love Joshua with all my heart. I need to see him. I need to be with him.\u201d</p><p>Her parents stared back at her, too shocked to respond right away.</p><p>\u201cHow did you meet him?\u201d The question came from her mother a moment later.</p><p>\u201cWe met at the Thanksgiving Day parade. Then, before I had a chance to analyze how I felt about him, Carl asked me to marry him. I didn\u2019t want to agree, but at the time it seemed like the best thing to do. You and Dad were so pleased, and you both like Carl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been like a son to me,\u201d her father admitted sadly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dad,\u201d Hannah whispered. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to disappoint you.\u201d Before either one could say anything more, she rushed out of the apartment.</p><p>\u201cHannah, please, don\u2019t go,\u201d her mother shouted from the top of the stairway, but Hannah pretended not to hear. Never in all her life had she ignored her mother and father.</p><p>Hannah caught a taxi outside the deli and read the driver the Riverside Drive address Joshua had written down on the back of his business card.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like it might snow,\u201d she said, glancing toward the darkening sky. The sooner she reached Joshua, the better. She needed him now as never before. When she told him what had happened, he\u2019d come with her and together they\u2019d talk to her family and make everything right.</p><p>The driver mumbled something in return that she didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>Several minutes later the cabdriver pulled over to the curb and flipped off the meter. Hannah gazed out the car window at the high-rise apartment building and experienced a sense of relief. The man she loved, the man she\u2019d defied her family to marry, lived in this building.</p><p>\u201cLady, are you going to stare out the window all day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sorry.\u201d She returned her attention to her purse and pulled out her wallet. From the corner of her eye, she caught sight of a familiar figure. Looking up, she saw Joshua coming out of the building. She raised her hand and was about to call him when, suddenly, she stopped. The happy shout died in her throat.</p><p>Joshua wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>Standing beside him was the most beautiful, elegant-looking woman Hannah had ever seen. Joshua slipped his arm around the other woman\u2019s waist, bent down, and kissed her gently on the lips.</p><p>Her heart pounding like a locomotive chugging uphill, Hannah hurled herself back against the seat, not wanting him to see her.</p><p>\u201cLady, are you going to pay me or not?\u201d the cabbie asked a second time with far less patience.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, of course.\u201d Hannah leaned forward just far enough to peek at Joshua. It was apparent the two were long-term acquaintances. The woman with him gazed up adoringly, as though this were the happiest day of her life.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Hannah whispered. \u201cTake me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got the money or don\u2019t you?\u201d the taxi driver asked.</p><p>She handed him a twenty-dollar bill for security. \u201cNow take me back,\u201d she pleaded. She\u2019d go home because she had nowhere else to go. With her tail between her legs, her heart heavy with pain, she\u2019d return to her family, who would love and support her despite the fact that she\u2019d deeply embarrassed and disappointed them.</p><p>\u201cAll right, if you want to go back, then fine, I\u2019ll take you.\u201d The driver hesitated, and Hannah met his gaze in the rearview mirror. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Hannah whispered.</p><p>She was too late. Joshua had found someone else.</p><p>Mike Glasser was buried two days later. Father Grady was scheduled to say the funeral mass and had spent considerable time counseling Mike\u2019s mother, Louise.</p><p>Brynn was one of the first to arrive at the church. She slipped into the pew and knelt down on the padded kneeler. Since hearing the news, she hadn\u2019t cried. It might have helped if she\u2019d been able to release her grief, but she held on to it with both hands, clenching it to her breast, fearing what would happen if she ever let go.</p><p>Mike\u2019s death was a constant, painful reminder of how badly she\u2019d failed him and her other students. How badly she\u2019d failed herself.</p><p>Emilio walked into church and sat in the pew directly across from her. Yolanda and Pearl arrived together and sat in front of Brynn.</p><p>The huge church was nearly half full with a number of other students and faculty members from Manhattan High. Mike\u2019s suicide had had a powerful impact on those who\u2019d known him.</p><p>Organ music, deep and somber, filled the church. Mike\u2019s mother and a handful of other relatives arrived. Together they walked down the center aisle. Louise Glasser\u2019s shoulders were bent under the weight of her grief. She appeared to be leaning heavily on the girl walking beside her. The two clung to each other. It didn\u2019t take Brynn long to realize the one with Mike\u2019s mother was Suzie Chang. They needed each other.</p><p>Brynn had met with them both, separately. They\u2019d come together as strangers with a common bond. Both had loved Mike. Both deeply grieved his death.</p><p>Organ music surged through the church as a man\u2019s voice, hauntingly melodic, rang loud and clear from the choir loft. The voice, a baritone, reached out and consoled with music those who\u2019d gathered to mourn Mike\u2019s death. Brynn recognized the singer\u2019s voice immediately.</p><p>Roberto.</p><p>Even from this distance his voice filled her with a bitter sadness. It settled in the pit of her stomach, and a chill came over her as she closed her eyes and soaked in the comfort of the song. She pretended it was Roberto\u2019s arms around her.</p><p>Since her last meeting with Roberto, Brynn had tried to push all thoughts of him from her mind. By the sheer force of her determination, she\u2019d partially succeeded. Despite her efforts to purge him from her thoughts, she couldn\u2019t keep from feeling that something important, something vital, was missing.</p><p>Once, a year or so before, Brynn had lost her purse. A knot had formed in her stomach that refused to go away until she was able to replace everything that had been lost. A similar sensation had been with her since her last meeting with Roberto. She was lost, and the way she felt just then, nothing would ever be right again. She supposed her thinking was melodramatic. In time she\u2019d be able to put these weeks in New York behind her.</p><p>As Roberto had encouraged her from the beginning, she would return to where she belonged. But she wouldn\u2019t go back to Rhode Island the same as when she\u2019d left. No, when she headed home, she\u2019d be bringing a lot of emotional baggage with her.</p><p>Father Grady said the mass. A wake was scheduled in the parish hall immediately following the service. Brynn knew she was expected to show. It was as good a time as any to tell her students that she wouldn\u2019t be back in class following winter vacation. Already they\u2019d been assigned another teacher, one with more experience than she.</p><p>Most of Brynn\u2019s apartment was packed. Depending on road conditions, she should be ready to leave in another day, two at the most.</p><p>When the service was over, Mike\u2019s family filed out first, then each row followed in turn.</p><p>Brynn stayed behind. She wanted a few moments alone before she headed over to the parish hall. With her head bowed, she tried to pray. Lately it had been a losing battle. Every concern she gave to God had claw marks all over it.</p><p>Not only had her abilities as a teacher been questioned, but her faith, once so stable and sure, had been badly shaken. She recognized that in time it would right itself again, but just then even that looked doubtful.</p><p>Footsteps sounded on the tile floor behind her. Brynn kept her head lowered, resenting the intrusion. She needed this time alone. She wasn\u2019t ready to join the others.</p><p>To her surprise it was Roberto who slipped into the pew and sat next to her. He didn\u2019t say anything, simply sat at her side, his head bowed in prayer.</p><p>After a while he touched her forearm. \u201cThe others are waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered back. \u201cTell them I\u2019ll be there in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t leave.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Roberto. I appreciate your concern, but there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d She hoped her weak smile would convince him she was telling the truth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t budge. \u201cI know you too well to believe that.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. His words set fire under her. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me at all, you never did.\u201d</p><p>Seeing that he wasn\u2019t going to leave her, she stood abruptly and made her way out of the pew and down the side aisle. Her crisp steps echoed in the empty church.</p><p>She must have risen too quickly, because she hadn\u2019t gone more than a few feet when her head started to swim and the room began to spin. Reaching out to the end of the wooden row, she caught herself in time to keep from collapsing.</p> <p>Roberto was at her side in an instant. He murmured something impatient in Spanish and led her to the back of the church.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d he insisted, and disappeared. No more than a minute passed before he returned with a glass of water.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with me,\u201d she insisted. She didn\u2019t want him to touch her. Didn\u2019t want him close to her. He was the one who wanted her out of his life. She\u2019d go. Kicking and screaming, she\u2019d abided by his wishes. However difficult, however painful. He had no reason to complain.</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you had anything to eat?\u201d</p><p>Brynn couldn\u2019t remember, but she wasn\u2019t about to let Roberto know that. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she insisted stiffly. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d kindly leave me alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrynn, please listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I understood you correctly, you don\u2019t want anything more to do with me. All I ask is that you respect my wishes, as I have yours.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, and Brynn felt a small sense of satisfaction, knowing her words had hit their mark.</p><p>\u201cAllow me to escort you to the wake. Please.\u201d She knew that the \u201cplease\u201d had cost him a great deal.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She didn\u2019t understand the necessity of this.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little thing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>It would be petty to refuse him, so she agreed. His arm came around her shoulder. She meant to shake it off, but the moment he brought her close to his side, the tears that had refused to come broke free in a surging dam of grief.</p><p>Brynn sank into the pew at the back of the vestibule and wept as though her very soul had been ripped from her body.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Roberto whispered, cradling her in his arms, pressing her head to his chest.</p><p>She didn\u2019t mean to cling to him, but her pride be damned, she needed him as she\u2019d never needed anyone.</p><p>He spoke again in Spanish, his voice low and soothing. Tucking her head against his shoulder, he rocked back and forth gently.</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d she admitted when the shoulder-shaking sobs had abated. \u201cYou tried to tell me, but I wouldn\u2019t listen. Now Mike\u2019s dead and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame yourself.\u201d</p><p>On a conscious level Brynn agreed with him, but deep inside she felt she carried a portion of the blame. Mike had trusted her enough to write her. She was the one person in all the world to whom he felt comfortable enough communicating his last wishes. Yet she\u2019d been oblivious of his pain, deaf to his needs. The boy had been desperate, and she had been blind.</p> <p>In retrospect Brynn realized that Mike had been trying to tell her in subtle ways of the hopelessness he experienced. His essays had been full of it. The dark side. Despondent words from a despondent youth.</p><p>Abruptly, Brynn pulled away from Roberto. In addition to his comfort, his embrace was a painful reminder that he wanted nothing more to do with her. If this was a contest, she was declaring him the winner.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be coming back,\u201d she announced firmly, surprised at the strength of her voice. \u201cI\u2019ve already given Mr. Whalen my letter of resignation. In January the kids will have a new teacher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo Emilio and the others know?\u201d Roberto asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do you plan to tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Something flashed in his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s for the best.\u201d</p><p>She noticed that Roberto didn\u2019t try to talk her out of leaving. She realized that was what she wanted, what she longed with all her being for him to do.</p><p>She stood. \u201cI\u2019ll do it now,\u201d she said, and boldly walked out the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to tell Gabriel?\u201d Shirley demanded of her two friends. The three had gathered in the choir loft following Mike\u2019s funeral, at a loss as to how to report their progress to the archangel.</p><p>\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve failed. He\u2019ll understand,\u201d Mercy offered.</p><p>\u201cHe might accept one failure, but all three of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened this year?\u201d Goodness threw her arms into the air, thoroughly disgusted by this unexpected turn of events.</p><p>Shirley cast them a disgruntled look. \u201cIt might have helped matters if you two hadn\u2019t been playing on escalators and writing on billboards in Times Square.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlaming each other isn\u2019t going to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s nearly Christmas Eve,\u201d Mercy protested. \u201cI can\u2019t possibly see us turning everything around at this late point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a chance if we work together.\u201d</p><p>Shirley shook her head slowly. \u201cIt seems to me working together is what got us into this mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, let\u2019s each report what\u2019s happening with our charges,\u201d Goodness suggested, and gestured for Shirley to go first.</p><p>\u201cWell, as you can see,\u201d Shirley said, pointing to Brynn, who sat in the corner of the parish hall, \u201cBrynn has said good-bye to her class. She\u2019s miserable, and blames herself for Mike\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t a clue,\u201d Shirley said, and sounded thoroughly miserable. \u201cGabriel was right, this assignment was too much for me. I\u2019ll leave him to pick up the pieces. It\u2019s going to take an archangel to bring about some good from this tragedy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoberto loves her,\u201d Goodness said, studying Emilio\u2019s brother.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d Shirley said sadly. \u201cLetting her leave is a sign of how much he cares for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more you can do?\u201d Mercy asked. \u201cPerhaps what Brynn needs is a little talking to from the three of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that would send her packing faster than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Goodness said, looking to Mercy. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening with Jenny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought she\u2019d be overjoyed to get this chance to star on Broadway. It\u2019s been her dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she isn\u2019t happy?\u201d</p><p>Mercy shrugged, apparently unable to come up with an explanation of her charge\u2019s behavior. \u201cShe\u2019s moped around the apartment for two days now. I\u2019m afraid she wants Trey with her and a chance to star on Broadway, but she can\u2019t have both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh boy,\u201d Shirley muttered. \u201cAnd what is Gabriel going to say about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I have the distinct notion he\u2019s going to think I was responsible for getting the play\u2019s director to notice her. I wasn\u2019t, truly I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d Shirley murmured, but her opinion wasn\u2019t the one that mattered, and all three knew it.</p><p>\u201cThat leaves me to tell you about Hannah,\u201d Goodness said, and her disappointment was keen. \u201cShe broke off the engagement with Carl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Both Shirley and Mercy brightened.</p><p>\u201cBut it was too late.\u201d Goodness told them that Joshua was dating Carol seriously now.</p><p>\u201cJoshua found someone else?\u201d Shirley asked. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>Mercy crossed her arms and pursed her lips. \u201cMen can be so fickle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my opinion he still loves Hannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he doesn\u2019t know that Hannah broke her engagement with Carl, does he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might have made a difference,\u201d Shirley insisted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d Goodness informed them sadly. \u201cHannah saw him with the other woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can fix that,\u201d Mercy said confidently. \u201cThis sort of thing is right up our alley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t work. Not this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Shirley insisted.</p><p>\u201cBecause Joshua has decided to cut his losses and look elsewhere for a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Hannah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannah will live with her parents the rest of her life and never marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a minute,\u201d Mercy said, and rolled up her sleeves. \u201cWe can fix that, and while we\u2019re at it, there are ways to deal with men as stubborn as Roberto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you and Jenny?\u201d Goodness asked.</p><p>Some of Mercy\u2019s brightness dimmed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we can do about Jenny and Trey.\u201d</p><p>Shirley rubbed her chin. \u201cI have an idea. All isn\u2019t lost yet.\u201d</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>From inside his office Joshua heard the raised voices of the receptionist and an angry man. He stepped into the hallway and heard David Morganstern, Hannah\u2019s father, demanding to see him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Julie,\u201d Joshua said, coming forward, \u201cI\u2019ll see Mr. Morganstern.\u201d</p><p>David shot the receptionist a look of triumph and straightened the cuffs of his coat sleeves. \u201cI told you Mr. Shadduck would see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have an appointment,\u201d Julie told Joshua, \u201cand he refused to make one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Julie.\u201d</p><p>Joshua escorted David into his office. The older man paused in the doorway and looked around. He didn\u2019t seem overly impressed. \u201cMighty fancy digs you have here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Giving the impression of nonchalance, Joshua sat down at his desk and invited Hannah\u2019s father to make himself comfortable. \u201cWhat can I do for you, Mr. Morganstern?\u201d</p><p>David sat on the cushion as if he expected it to jump up and bite him at any moment. \u201cI\u2019ve come to ask you a few questions, young man. I recently learned, through no fault of my daughter\u2019s, that you\u2019ve been sneaking around with Hannah. I want you to know I don\u2019t like it one bit.\u201d</p><p>Joshua folded his hands on top of the desk and waited.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to meet the man face to face who played havoc with my daughter\u2019s life.\u201d It was clear David\u2019s feelings ran strong and fervent. The older gentleman bolted out of the chair and stood directly in front of Joshua\u2019s desk.</p><p>Joshua wondered exactly how much David knew about the two of them and feared saying more than he should.</p><p>\u201cYour silence tells me everything I need to know,\u201d David said, spitting out the words, revealing his distaste. \u201cI find you to be the most despicable kind of man.\u201d</p><p>Joshua didn\u2019t blame Morganstern. His behavior had been less than honorable. He\u2019d never been comfortable meeting Hannah on the sly, kissing her, urging her to continue their relationship while she was engaged to another man. He wasn\u2019t comfortable now, offering excuses.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Joshua couldn\u2019t keep himself from asking.</p><p>\u201cHow do you think?\u201d David demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou have my apology,\u201d Joshua said, hoping the other man understood the full extent of his regret. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat about Carl? Are you willing to apologize to him, too? What about Hannah? My daughter gave you her heart, and it meant nothing to the mighty, powerful attorney. You people seem to think you have the right to disrupt lives. It\u2019s time someone made you accountable for your actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to apologize to Carl?\u201d Joshua asked, willing to do whatever he could to appease Hannah\u2019s family and make matters easier for her. Personally he thought the less Carl knew about him, the better.</p><p>David considered his offer, then shrugged. \u201cNo. Carl and our family aren\u2019t exactly on speaking terms.\u201d</p><p>Joshua leaned forward slightly, wondering if he\u2019d heard him correctly. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>David sat back down and eyed Joshua suspiciously. \u201cYou mean to say you honestly don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t ask if I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannah loves you.\u201d</p><p>The confirmation of her feelings should have brought him joy; instead he was filled with a deep, painful sense of loss. \u201cI love her, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in my book,\u201d David fumed. \u201cYou leave her to face Carl alone, and when she breaks the engagement, you dump her.\u201d</p> <p>It was Joshua\u2019s turn to bolt upright. \u201cHannah broke off the engagement?\u201d</p><p>David frowned and nodded. \u201cYou mean to say you didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>Joshua came out from behind his desk. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe defied both her mother and me when we insisted she not see you again. Then less than a half hour after she leaves, she returns, tells us how sorry she is for having upset us, and goes to her bedroom. She hasn\u2019t been herself since. She won\u2019t talk about you or Carl, but it\u2019s plain as the nose on my face that she\u2019s miserable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe never told me. I knew how difficult all this was for her. She didn\u2019t want to hurt anyone, least of all her family and especially not Carl. Every time she promised to break the engagement something more would happen to prevent it. I felt the only thing I could do was step aside.\u201d</p><p>It was clear David wasn\u2019t interested in hearing explanations. \u201cDo you or don\u2019t you love my daughter?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love her,\u201d Joshua said with conviction.</p><p>\u201cThen what are your intentions?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI want to marry her.\u201d</p><p>David glanced around the office once more, this time with a less critical eye. \u201cTalk to Hannah first, and then you and I might strike some kind of agreement. We could do with a lawyer in the family.\u201d He started toward the door, then stopped abruptly and turned around. \u201cAre you coming or not, young man?\u201d</p><p>Joshua laughed and reached for his coat. \u201cComing.\u201d</p><p>David nodded once, profoundly. \u201cGood, that\u2019s exactly what I wanted to hear.\u201d</p><p>Hannah was working the counter when Joshua walked inside the deli, her father at his side.</p><p>\u201cHannah,\u201d David shouted, \u201cyou\u2019ve got company. Take him upstairs and serve him a piece of your mother\u2019s cheesecake.\u201d</p> <p>Hannah ignored her father and directed her question to Joshua. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to talk to you. I suggest we go upstairs as your father advised.\u201d They\u2019d already attracted more than enough attention.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Ruth Morganstern insisted to Hannah. \u201cThis way, young man,\u201d she said, and directed Joshua around the counter, pointing the way to their private quarters.</p><p>Joshua followed Hannah up the stairs. She paused halfway up and turned to face him. From her position on the stairway they were at eye level. It required more discipline than he\u2019d needed in quite some time not to kiss her right then and there.</p><p>\u201cWhat did my father say to you?\u201d she demanded. Her eyes were full of fire. \u201cI don\u2019t need your pity, Joshua Shadduck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pity?\u201d This came at him out of the blue. \u201cIf anyone is asking questions, it should be me. The last thing I heard was your father inviting me to your wedding to another man.\u201d</p><p>Hannah\u2019s shoulders went stiff. \u201cThe last time I saw you, you were kissing another woman.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow should I know?\u201d she flared.</p><p>The door at the bottom of the stairs opened. \u201cUpstairs, Hannah. The entire deli is listening in on your conversation.\u201d</p><p>If ever Hannah needed an incentive, this appeared to be it. She raced up the remainder of the stairs.</p><p>Joshua was left with no choice but to follow her, which he did gladly. He found her standing in front of a window, looking out, her back to him, her arms folded around her middle.</p><p>\u201cHer name\u2019s Carol,\u201d he said gently, wanting to clear the air as soon as he could so they could move on to the more important matters. \u201cI\u2019ve known her for a number of years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should marry her,\u201d she suggested, turning to face him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. She\u2019s a wonderful woman, but she isn\u2019t you. You\u2019re the one who owns my heart. You have from nearly the first moment we met. I had to let you go, Hannah, surely you understand that. My love was hurting you. The family pressures on you to marry Carl were overwhelming. Stepping aside was the only decent thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t take you long to recover, did it?\u201d</p><p>She was jealous of Carol, and Joshua thrilled at the realization. \u201cI see it\u2019s done a bit of good for you to know how I\u2019ve felt these last few weeks. It wasn\u2019t easy on me when you were spending time with Carl. It was probably the most difficult thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always loved you, and you knew it. You never had a single reason to be jealous.\u201d</p><p>Joshua longed to hold and kiss her too much to argue the point. \u201cAre you going to marry me or not, Hannah Morganstern?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes searched his as if she questioned the sincerity of his proposal.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he added tenderly, and held open his arms to her.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take her long to find her way into his embrace. When she slipped her arms around his middle, Joshua sighed with a sense of peace, of homecoming. He\u2019d been waiting all his life for this woman, and now that she was his, he didn\u2019t intend to lose her.</p><p>Tunneling his fingers through her hair, Joshua positioned his mouth to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been so unhappy,\u201d she admitted on the tail end of a soft moan.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d He kissed her again.</p><p>\u201cBut you weren\u2019t lonely,\u201d she accused. \u201cI was miserable and lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Hannah,\u201d he said, laying his heart at her feet. \u201cYou\u2019re going to marry me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He held her against him protectively. \u201cIt\u2019s the oddest thing,\u201d he mumbled, nuzzling his face close to hers.</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d she said, thrilling him with small kisses along the underside of his jaw.</p><p>\u201cYour father claims I gave him my business card. I never did. I haven\u2019t a clue where he got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>Joshua chuckled. \u201cNot in the least.\u201d</p><p>The last thing Brynn anticipated when she was ready to leave New York was car problems. Ever since Roberto had worked on her carburetor, her Escort had been running like a dream. Now, however, the engine wouldn\u2019t so much as crank.</p><p>The first thing she did was contact her family and tell them. Her parents were concerned about her, and they weren\u2019t happy to have her traveling home alone, but she couldn\u2019t very well desert her vehicle.</p><p>Sitting inside her apartment, she thumbed through the telephone directory, looking for a garage listing, knowing full well her chances of finding someone willing to work on her car on Christmas Eve were damn near impossible.</p><p>Her doorbell chimed, and disheartened, Brynn slipped off the stool. When she checked her peephole the first person she saw was Emilio, but there were a number of others she recognized with him.</p><p>After flipping open the latch, she found herself facing a throng of her students and their parents.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d she asked. There must have been close to fifty people jam-packed into her hallway.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want you to leave, Miss Cassidy,\u201d Emilio said, serving as spokesperson for the group. \u201cAfter Mike\u2019s funeral a number of us went and talked to Mr. Whalen. We asked that the school refuse to accept your letter of resignation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how much we were able to influence him,\u201d Yolanda said, laughing nervously. \u201cI think our parents had a far greater impact.\u201d</p><p>Suzie Chang\u2019s delicate mother pressed forward and in halting English said, \u201cYou say it honor to have Suzie in class. We say it greater honor to have you for teacher.\u201d</p><p>A cry of agreement followed the Chinese woman\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cWe love you, Miss Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>Brynn couldn\u2019t speak for the lump in her throat. Never in all her dreams had she expected anything like this.</p><p>\u201cMr. Whalen says you can have your job back, if you want it,\u201d Denzil\u2019s mother told her. \u201cFor the first time in his life, my son\u2019s doing well in school. He\u2019s talking about something other than video games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say, Miss Cassidy?\u201d</p><p>Frankly, Brynn was left speechless.</p><p>\u201cSay something,\u201d Emilio urged.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know . . . I just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive the girl some room to breathe.\u201d Parents and teens parted so Father Grady could make his way to the front.</p><p>\u201cFather Grady!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know I was here? My dear, I was the one who drove the bus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou brought the church bus?\u201d Brynn placed both hands over her mouth to keep from laughing out loud.</p><p>\u201cRoberto\u2019s driving it around the block, looking for a place to park now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoberto.\u201d Brynn whispered his name.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you right now, Teach,\u201d Emilio advised from the corner of his mouth, \u201cyou have to be patient with my brother, but once he learns something, you\u2019ll never have to teach him again.\u201d</p><p>She caught sight of Roberto just then, hurrying down the corridor, breathing hard. He slowed his pace when he saw her.</p><p>\u201cWill you stay, Miss Cassidy?\u201d</p><p>Brynn reached out and touched Yolanda\u2019s face. Then, because it seemed to be so important to everyone else, she nodded.</p><p>A loud cheer went up, and Brynn\u2019s next-door neighbor opened the door and stuck out her head. \u201cRalph, I told you there was a party going on in the hallway. Come and look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Mrs. Camden,\u201d Brynn called, and waved.</p><p>\u201cIs everyone invited?\u201d her neighbor asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Father Grady answered. \u201cCome with us. We got what we came for.\u201d One by one they filed down the hallway. Lorraine Camden and her husband joined the line, chattering as they went.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Brynn heard the older woman ask.</p><p>\u201cTo the bus,\u201d someone answered.</p><p>\u201cRalph, they have a bus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Lorraine, I heard.\u201d</p><p>Soon only Brynn and Roberto were left. She led him inside her apartment and closed the door. With her back pressed against it, she studied him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally, when she couldn\u2019t stand not to know any longer, she asked, \u201cYou want me to stay, too?\u201d</p><p>He avoided eye contact. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d he shouted, as if it made him mad to have to say it. \u201cI want you to stay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She wasn\u2019t going to make it easy for him.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a damn good teacher and there isn\u2019t a student in your class who didn\u2019t protest when they learned you were leaving.\u201d</p><p>She took two steps away from the door. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about my students. I\u2019m asking why you don\u2019t want me to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d He swallowed uncomfortably, then pointed to the door. \u201cFather Grady might have a problem driving the bus. It would be better if we continued this conversation some other time.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cNot on your life, buster.\u201d</p> <p>To her amazement, Roberto broke out laughing. \u201cBuster. That\u2019s exactly why I love you so damn much, Brynn Cassidy. The worst you can think to call me is Buster.\u201d He whispered something in Spanish.</p><p>\u201cIf you love me, then why were you so eager to be rid of me?\u201d</p><p>He channeled his fingers through his hair and sighed audibly. \u201cBecause I love you. This neighborhood has a way of dragging people down. Eventually it would happen to you, and I couldn\u2019t bear to sit by and watch that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you\u2019re with me that\u2019s not going to happen. We can help one another.\u201d</p><p>He buried both hands deep in his pockets. \u201cI\u2019d like to be self-sacrificing and send you back to that fancy girls\u2019 school, but I can\u2019t. The problem is I need you as much as Emilio and his friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a start,\u201d she said, smiling through her tears. She held her arms out to him.</p> <p>Roberto reached for her and kissed her gently.</p><p>\u201cI need you, too, Roberto . . . so much,\u201d she whispered, kissing him freely and fully.</p><p>Roberto groaned and forced her lips to part beneath his. His tongue probed hers in a silken dance, then plunged forward, unleashing a fiery passion.</p><p>At last, groaning, he broke away. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnto the bus. Father Grady can\u2019t drive worth beans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we headed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChurch,\u201d he told her. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t mind. It seems like the perfect place for us to be on Christmas Eve.\u201d</p><p>The weather was perfect for such a night. Trey glanced at the clear, bright sky as he made his way from the house to the barn. When he\u2019d finished feeding the horses and settling them down for the evening, he planned on stopping off at the Lancasters\u2019 for some of Dillon\u2019s wassail. It had become tradition that he join Jenny\u2019s family for the Christmas Eve celebration.</p><p>He\u2019d eat dinner with them, and then they\u2019d attend church services together. The last couple of years the family had invited him to stay for the gift opening, but Trey had refused.</p><p>He\u2019d often spent time with the Lancasters on the off chance they could tell him something about Jenny. This year he knew everything there was to know. He\u2019d go for dinner and attend the evening church service, and then, as always, he\u2019d head home. Alone.</p><p>Jenny hadn\u2019t contacted him since he\u2019d left New York, not that he\u2019d expected she would.</p><p>Pausing in the hallway, Trey picked up the box of fancy chocolates he\u2019d bought for Jenny\u2019s mother. He figured every woman deserved a box of expensive French candies one time in her life. Besides, he owed Paula.</p><p>The Lancaster house was bright with outside lights. Trey never could pull into their yard and not think of Jenny. The tightness around his heart felt almost physical as he climbed down from his truck and headed inside.</p><p>His timing was perfect. Charlie, Jenny\u2019s brother, and his fianc\u00e9e, Mary Lou, were carrying serving dishes to the dining room table.</p><p>\u201cHello, Trey. Welcome.\u201d Paula kissed him on the cheek. Trey tucked the chocolates under the tree and shook Dillon\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cThink it\u2019ll snow?\u201d Dillon asked. It was the same question his friend proposed every Christmas Eve.</p><p>\u201cNot this year,\u201d Trey told him, knowing it would disappoint Dillon.</p><p>The smells coming from the kitchen were tantalizing enough to convince a confirmed bachelor to find a wife.</p><p>Dillon offered him a glass of hot wassail, but Trey declined. He didn\u2019t figure there was enough time to finish it before dinner was served.</p><p>\u201cMom, are these the linen napkins you were looking for earlier?\u201d a soft voice asked from the vicinity of the hallway.</p><p>It was a good thing Trey hadn\u2019t been holding a drink. Sure as hell, he would have dropped it. The voice he heard belonged to Jenny. She paused momentarily when she walked into the room. \u201cHello, Trey. Merry Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Trey felt as if someone had knocked him behind the knees with a baseball bat. He stared at Dillon. \u201cWhat\u2019s Jenny doing home?\u201d</p><p>Dillon looked well pleased. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask her that yourself.\u201d</p><p>Trey intended on doing exactly that. He followed her into the kitchen and stood behind her while she dished up a mound of steaming mashed potatoes.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you arrive?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThis morning.\u201d She answered him as though there were a hundred other more important items occupying her mind at that moment. \u201cI do need to talk to you, however. I didn\u2019t take kindly to your leaving New York without saying good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrey, would you mind putting the relish plate on the table?\u201d Paula asked.</p><p>\u201cIn a minute.\u201d He wasn\u2019t budging until he had the answer he wanted.</p><p>\u201cThe potatoes are ready,\u201d Jenny announced, and handed the bowl to her brother, who promptly delivered them to the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the play?\u201d Trey insisted.</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said the rehearsals started before Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did.\u201d Jenny dipped her finger inside the gravy boat and licked it clean. \u201cMom, this is your best ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, darling.\u201d</p><p>Charlie returned, and Trey handed Jenny\u2019s brother the relish dish. He followed Jenny to the other side of the kitchen. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be there?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>He figured she was being deliberately obtuse, and it irritated him no end. \u201cPracticing,\u201d he said louder than he intended.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d she mumbled, then said to her mother, \u201cAs far as I can see, everything\u2019s on the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Call your father and we\u2019ll sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner,\u201d Jenny called, and the family started to gather around the dining room table.</p><p>\u201cJenny.\u201d Trey\u2019s hand on her arm stopped her. Silently he pleaded with her to tell him what was going on. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you in New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou honestly don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>Baffled, he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m marrying you, Trey. We\u2019ve got the next fifty years to discuss all this, but right now dinner is getting cold.\u201d She left him standing in the middle of her mother\u2019s kitchen with his mouth sagging open so far, it damn near bounced against the floor.</p><p>By the time he\u2019d recovered enough to walk into the dining room, everyone was seated and waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cTrey, would you care to say grace?\u201d</p><p>Everyone looked to him, but for the life of him Trey couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Jenny long enough to do as her mother requested.</p><p>\u201cIt seems Trey\u2019s otherwise occupied,\u201d Dillon said, chuckling. \u201cI\u2019ll be happy to say the blessing.\u201d</p><p>The Lancaster family bowed their heads while Dillon offered up a short prayer of thanksgiving. When he\u2019d finished, he looked to Trey. \u201cSit down, Trey. Your place is directly across from Jenny. Once you\u2019re seated, would you kindly pass the mashed potatoes?\u201d</p><p>Trey was certain he gave them all a good laugh. The first thing he did was pour gravy over the sweet potatoes. He couldn\u2019t help it. Nothing could make him stop staring at Jenny. He doubted he ate two bites of the entire dinner.</p><p>Twice she looked up and smiled, and it was damn near all he could do not to reach for her right there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate a few minutes alone with Jenny after dinner,\u201d he said, looking to her parents.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need our permission,\u201d Dillon responded. \u201cJenny makes her own decisions.\u201d</p><p>An eternity passed before the meal was over. Jenny tormented him during dessert by licking the whipped cream off the back of her fork\u2014her eyes locked on him the entire time.</p><p>When she announced she was too full to take another bite, Trey nearly picked her up out of the chair in his eagerness to get her alone.</p><p>\u201cHow about a stroll to the barn,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He didn\u2019t care if she suggested New Zealand; he wasn\u2019t waiting another minute for her to explain her earlier statement.</p><p>The night was clear and crisp. Trey led her by the hand into the barn. \u201cAll right,\u201d he demanded without turning on any of the lights. \u201cDid you mean what you said earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said a number of things. Which one do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJenny, for the love of heaven.\u201d He jerked her into his arms, and it wasn\u2019t until she slammed against his chest that he realized how willingly she\u2019d come.</p><p>\u201cYou big oaf,\u201d she said, solidly planting her lips over his before he had a chance to kiss her. Wanting her as badly as he did, for as long as he had, Trey nearly crumpled to the floor under the weight of his joy. The kiss was slow and deep and moist.</p><p>\u201cOaf?\u201d he repeated, holding her head so he could kiss her again and again. Fifty years wouldn\u2019t be nearly enough to satisfy him.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t stick around long enough for me to answer. If you\u2019re going to propose to a woman, the least you can do is wait for the response.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her just long enough to cut off her tirade. \u201cAnswer me now.\u201d</p><p>She threw back her head and laughed. \u201cFirst I think I\u2019ll make you suffer.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t a clue to how much he\u2019d already been suffering. His breath came fast and heavy as she brought his mouth down to hers once more.</p><p>\u201cJenny, I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. We\u2019re going to be very happy, Trey. First we\u2019re going to get married, then we\u2019re going to start our family. I want a house full of children. I\u2019ve been so hungry for family.\u201d</p><p>His throat went thick. \u201cThat sounds perfectly fine with me.\u201d He kissed her a dozen times, and even the gentleness between them, the love and tenderness, were far from being sated. \u201cWhat about New York?\u201d He had to know.</p><p>\u201cMichelle got the part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I heard . . . Irene asked to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true they offered it to me first, but when I declined, the role went to Michelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this was your big dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved New York, but I love you more. Montana is where I belong, right here with you. I knew it a long time ago, but was too stubborn to admit it. I\u2019m home now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The back porch light went on, and Dillon appeared on the top step, although there wasn\u2019t any chance he could see them. \u201cHey, you two, it\u2019s about time for church. Are you ready or not?\u201d</p><p>Trey\u2019s hand squeezed Jenny\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019ll be inside in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there going to be a wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Trey shouted back. \u201cSoon, too, the sooner the better.\u201d</p> <p>Dillon laughed. \u201cWelcome to the family.\u201d</p><p>Trey kissed Jenny one last time, and with their arms wrapped around each other, they headed for the house.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t gone more than a few steps when thick, flat flakes of snow drifted down from the sky.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said it wasn\u2019t going to snow,\u201d Dillon challenged, waiting for them on the back porch.</p><p>Trey looked up to the bright, clear sky. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it\u2019s coming from,\u201d he mumbled, puzzled.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe someone up there is telling us how pleased they are to hear we\u2019re going to be married,\u201d Jenny suggested.</p><p>Trey kept his eyes trained on the cloudless sky. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me we\u2019ve met in a similar spot before,\u201d Gabriel said to Shirley, Goodness, and Mercy as they sat in the choir loft of St. Philip\u2019s. The congregation crowded into the church for the Christmas Eve ceremonies. Candles brightened the interior, and pure red poinsettias decorated the altar.</p><p>\u201cHello again,\u201d Shirley said, leaning over the loft to get a better view of Brynn and Roberto. The two sat together, holding hands and singing. They appeared to have eyes only for each other.</p><p>\u201cBrynn\u2019s decided to stay,\u201d Shirley told Gabriel, although it was unnecessary. The archangel was well aware of Brynn\u2019s future plans.</p><p>\u201cYou outdid yourself, Shirley. You all did. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p> <p>All three prayer ambassadors blushed with pleasure. \u201cThank you,\u201d Shirley said.</p><p>\u201cThere is that one small matter involving Brynn\u2019s car, however.\u201d</p><p>Shirley glanced guiltily toward her two friends, whose attention seemed to be conveniently occupied elsewhere. \u201cI had to do something, and fast,\u201d she rushed to explain.</p><p>\u201cShe was about to leave, and the church bus was due any time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Gabriel said benevolently. \u201cTampering with a car engine is small potatoes compared to horsing around with the Statue of Liberty.\u201d</p><p>That captured Goodness\u2019s and Mercy\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cWhat does the future hold for Brynn?\u201d Shirley asked in a diversionary tactic.</p><p>\u201cAh yes, Brynn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill she marry Roberto?\u201d Shirley asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, next year at this time, to be exact. Eventually Roberto will find a way out of this neighborhood, too. His shop will inspire other Hispanics to start their own businesses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Emilio, Suzie, and the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmilio will go on to college and become a teacher himself. The day will come when he\u2019ll be at Manhattan High once more, but not as a student.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmilio?\u201d Shirley didn\u2019t bother to disguise her amazement.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an intelligent young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Suzie and Modesto?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuzie will have a baby girl in the spring. She\u2019ll decide to raise the child herself, and with the help of Mike\u2019s mother and her own family she\u2019ll be able to attend college. Suzie is going to major in medicine and do great work in the study of depression and its treatment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Modesto?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel frowned and shook his head sadly. \u201cNot long after he recovers from the gunshot he\u2019ll become heavily involved in drugs and waste his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Trey and Jenny?\u201d Mercy asked.</p><p>\u201cAh yes, Jenny.\u201d Gabriel turned his attention to Mercy. \u201cIsn\u2019t it amazing that snow would fall from a cloudless sky?\u201d He watched his favorite prayer ambassadors squirm and had a difficult time not chuckling.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll marry on Valentine\u2019s Day,\u201d he informed her.</p><p>Mercy clapped her hands together. \u201cThat\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the next six years they\u2019ll add two girls and two boys to their family. The girls will be as talented as their mother, and the three will form a singing group and frequently perform at church functions. The boys won\u2019t be able to carry a tune to save their lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sweet. Will Jenny have any regrets about giving up her chance to perform on Broadway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a one,\u201d Gabriel assured Mercy.</p><p>\u201cHannah and Joshua?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yes . . .\u201d Gabriel scratched the side of his face. \u201cThey\u2019ll marry this June, and Hannah\u2019s mother will fight with the wedding coordinator from the first moment they meet. The wedding will be one of the most talked-about affairs in New York. It\u2019ll be lovely.\u201d Gabriel smiled to himself. \u201cTen years from now, when their son and daughter are still young, Joshua will run for state senator and win. Joshua realizes that Hannah is not only his wife and partner for life, she\u2019s his greatest political asset as well.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Gabriel asked, gesturing skyward.</p><p>The three nodded. In the distance the archangel could hear music from the harps of heaven. It was a night wrapped in glory and time for them to head home. </p> </body></html>"]
