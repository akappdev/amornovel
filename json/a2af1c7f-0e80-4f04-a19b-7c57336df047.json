It\u2019s hard to say who most of all. Before he was Margot\u2019s boyfriend, he was just Josh. He was always there. I say always, but I guess that\u2019s not true. He moved next door five years ago but it feels like always.</p><p>My dad loves Josh because he\u2019s a boy and my dad is surrounded by girls. I mean it: all day long he is surrounded by females. My dad is an ob-gyn, and he also happens to be the father of three daughters, so it\u2019s like girls, girls, girls all day. He also likes Josh because Josh likes comics and he\u2019ll go fishing with him. My dad tried to take us fishing once, and I cried when my shoes got mud on them, and Margot cried when her book got wet, and Kitty cried because Kitty was still practically a baby.</p><p>Kitty loves Josh because he\u2019ll play cards with her and not get bored. Or at least pretend to not get bored. They make deals with each other\u2014if I win this next hand, you have to make me a toasted crunchy-peanut-butter-sandwich, no crusts. That\u2019s Kitty. Inevitably there won\u2019t be crunchy peanut butter and Josh will say too bad, pick something else. But then Kitty will wear him down and he\u2019ll run out and buy some, because that\u2019s Josh.</p> <p>If I had to say why Margot loves him, I think maybe I would say it\u2019s because we all do.</p><p>We are in the living room, Kitty is pasting pictures of dogs to a giant piece of cardboard. There\u2019s paper and scraps all around her. Humming to herself, she says, \u201cWhen Daddy asks me what I want for Christmas, I am just going to say, \u2018Pick any one of these breeds and we\u2019ll be good.\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Margot and Josh are on the couch; I\u2019m lying on the floor, watching TV. Josh popped a big bowl of popcorn, and I devote myself to it, handfuls and handfuls of it.</p><p>A commercial comes on for perfume: a girl is running around the streets of Paris in an orchid-colored halter dress that is thin as tissue paper. What I wouldn\u2019t give to be that girl in that tissue-paper dress running around Paris in springtime! I sit up so suddenly I choke on a kernel of popcorn. Between coughs I say, \u201cMargot, let\u2019s meet in Paris for my spring break!\u201d I\u2019m already picturing myself twirling with a pistachio macaron in one hand and a raspberry one in the other.</p><p>Margot\u2019s eyes light up. \u201cDo you think Daddy will let you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, it\u2019s culture. He\u2019ll have to let me.\u201d But it\u2019s true that I\u2019ve never flown by myself before. And also I\u2019ve never even left the country before. Would Margot meet me at the airport, or would I have to find my own way to the hostel?</p><p>Josh must see the sudden worry on my face because he says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Your dad will definitely let you go if I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>I brighten. \u201cYeah! We can stay at hostels and just eat pastries and cheese for all our meals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can go to Jim Morrison\u2019s grave!\u201d Josh throws in.</p><p>\u201cWe can go to a parfumerie and get our personal scents done!\u201d I cheer, and Josh snorts.</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m pretty sure \u2018getting our scents done\u2019 at a parfumerie would cost the same as a week\u2019s stay at the hostel,\u201d he says. He nudges Margot. \u201cYour sister suffers from delusions of grandeur.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe is the fanciest of the three of us,\u201d Margot agrees.</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Kitty whimpers.</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d I scoff. \u201cYou\u2019re the least fancy Song girl. I have to beg you to wash your feet at night, much less take a shower.\u201d</p><p>Kitty\u2019s face gets pinched and red. \u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about that, you dodo bird. I was talking about Paris.\u201d</p><p>Airily, I wave her off. \u201cYou\u2019re too little to stay at a hostel.\u201d</p><p>She crawls over to Margot and climbs in her lap, even though she\u2019s nine and nine is too big to sit in people\u2019s laps. \u201cMargot, you\u2019ll let me go, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it could be a family vacation,\u201d Margot says, kissing her cheek. \u201cYou and Lara Jean and Daddy could all come.\u201d</p><p>I frown. That\u2019s not at all the Paris trip I was imagining. Over Kitty\u2019s head Josh mouths to me, We\u2019ll talk later, and I give him a discreet thumbs-up.</p> <p>It\u2019s later that night; Josh is long gone. Kitty and our dad are asleep. We are in the kitchen. Margot is at the table on her computer; I am sitting next to her, rolling cookie dough into balls and dropping them in cinnamon and sugar. Snickerdoodles to get back in Kitty\u2019s good graces. Earlier, when I went in to say good night, Kitty rolled over and wouldn\u2019t speak to me because she\u2019s still convinced I\u2019m going to try to cut her out of the Paris trip. My plan is to put the snickerdoodles on a plate right next to her pillow so she wakes up to the smell of fresh-baked cookies.</p><p>Margot\u2019s being extra quiet, and then, out of nowhere, she looks up from her computer and says, \u201cI broke up with Josh tonight. After dinner.\u201d</p><p>My cookie-dough ball falls out of my fingers and into the sugar bowl.</p><p>\u201cI mean, it was time,\u201d she says. Her eyes aren\u2019t red-rimmed; she hasn\u2019t been crying, I don\u2019t think. Her voice is calm and even. Anyone looking at her would think she was fine. Because Margot is always fine, even when she\u2019s not.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why you had to break up,\u201d I say. \u201cJust \u2019cause you\u2019re going to college doesn\u2019t mean you have to break up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara Jean, I\u2019m going to Scotland, not UVA. Saint Andrews is nearly four thousand miles away.\u201d She pushes up her glasses. \u201cWhat would be the point?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t even believe she would say that. \u201cThe point is, it\u2019s Josh. Josh who loves you more than any boy has ever loved a girl!\u201d</p><p>Margot rolls her eyes at this. She thinks I\u2019m being dramatic, but I\u2019m not. It\u2019s true\u2014that\u2019s how much Josh loves Margot. He would never so much as look at another girl.</p><p>Suddenly she says, \u201cDo you know what Mommy told me once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d For a moment I forget all about Josh. Because no matter what I am doing in life, if Margot and I are in the middle of an argument, if I am about to get hit by a car, I will always stop and listen to a story about Mommy. Any detail, any remembrance that Margot has, I want to have it too. I\u2019m better off than Kitty, though. Kitty doesn\u2019t have one memory of Mommy that we haven\u2019t given her. We\u2019ve told her so many stories so many times that they\u2019re hers now. \u201cRemember that time . . . ,\u201d she\u2019ll say. And then she\u2019ll tell the story like she was there and not just a little baby. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe told me to try not to go to college with a boyfriend. She said she didn\u2019t want me to be the girl crying on the phone with her boyfriend and saying no to things instead of yes.\u201d</p><p>Scotland is Margot\u2019s yes, I guess. Absently, I scoop up a mound of cookie dough and pop it in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t eat raw cookie dough,\u201d Margot says.</p><p>I ignore her. \u201cJosh would never hold you back from anything. He\u2019s not like that. Remember how when you decided to run for student-body president, he was your campaign manager? He\u2019s your biggest fan!\u201d</p> <p>At this, the corners of Margot\u2019s mouth turn down, and I get up and fling my arms around her neck. She leans her head back and smiles up at me. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she says, but she isn\u2019t, I know she isn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too late, you know. You can go over there right now and tell him you changed your mind.\u201d</p><p>Margot shakes her head. \u201cIt\u2019s done, Lara Jean.\u201d I release her and she closes her laptop. \u201cWhen will the first batch be ready? I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>I look at the magnetic egg timer on the fridge. \u201cFour more minutes.\u201d I sit back down and say, \u201cI don\u2019t care what you say, Margot. You guys aren\u2019t done. You love him too much.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cLara Jean,\u201d she begins, in her patient Margot voice, like I am a child and she is a wise old woman of forty-two.</p> <p>I wave a spoonful of cookie dough under Margot\u2019s nose, and she hesitates and then opens her mouth. I feed it to her like a baby. \u201cWait and see, you and Josh will be back together in a day, maybe two.\u201d But even as I\u2019m saying it, I know it\u2019s not true. Margot\u2019s not the kind of girl to break up and get back together on a whim; once she\u2019s decided something, that\u2019s it. There\u2019s no waffling, no regrets. It\u2019s like she said: when she\u2019s done, she\u2019s just done.</p><p>I wish (and this is a thought I\u2019ve had many, many times, too many times to count) I was more like Margot. Because sometimes it feels like I\u2019ll never be done.</p><p>Later, after I\u2019ve washed the dishes and plated the cookies and set them on Kitty\u2019s pillow, I go to my room. I don\u2019t turn the light on. I go to my window. Josh\u2019s light is still on.</p><p>2</p><p>THE NEXT MORNING, MARGOT IS making coffee and I am pouring cereal in bowls, and I say the thing I\u2019ve been thinking all morning. \u201cJust so you know, Daddy and Kitty are going to be really upset.\u201d When Kitty and I were brushing our teeth just now, I was tempted to go ahead and spill the beans, but Kitty was still mad at me from yesterday, so I kept quiet. She didn\u2019t even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs.</p><p>Margot lets out a heavy sigh. \u201cSo I\u2019m supposed to stay with Josh because of you and Daddy and Kitty?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m just telling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like he would come over here that much once I was gone, anyway.\u201d</p><p>I frown. This didn\u2019t occur to me, that Josh would stop coming over because Margot was gone. He was coming over long before they were ever a couple, so I don\u2019t see why he should stop. \u201cHe might,\u201d I say. \u201cHe really loves Kitty.\u201d</p><p>She pushes the start button on the coffee machine. I\u2019m watching her super carefully because Margot\u2019s always been the one to make the coffee and I never have, and now that she\u2019s leaving (only six more days), I\u2019d better know how. With her back to me she says, \u201cMaybe I won\u2019t even mention it to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, I think they\u2019ll figure it out when he\u2019s not at the airport, Gogo.\u201d Gogo is my nickname for Margot. As in go-go boots. \u201cHow many cups of water did you put in there? And how many spoons of coffee beans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll write it all down for you,\u201d Margot assures me. \u201cIn the notebook.\u201d</p><p>We keep a house notebook by the fridge. Margot\u2019s idea, of course. It has all the important numbers and Daddy\u2019s schedule and Kitty\u2019s carpool. \u201cMake sure you put in the number for the new dry cleaners,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cAlready done.\u201d Margot slices a banana for her cereal: each slice is perfectly thin. \u201cAnd also, Josh wouldn\u2019t have come to the airport with us anyway. You know how I feel about sad good-byes.\u201d Margot makes a face, like Ugh, emotions.</p> <p>I do know.</p><p>When Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with the maps and the travel books and the plans. Of course she would leave us one day.</p><p>I\u2019m still mad at her, just a little. Just a teeny-tiny bit. Obviously I know it\u2019s not her fault. But she\u2019s going so far away, and we always said we\u2019d be the Song girls forever. Margot first, me in the middle, and my sister Kitty last. On her birth certificate she is Katherine; to us she is Kitty. Occasionally we call her Kitten, because that\u2019s what I called her when she was born: she looked like a scrawny, hairless kitten.</p><p>We are the three Song girls. There used to be four. My mom, Eve Song. Evie to my dad, Mommy to us, Eve to everyone else. Song is, was, my mom\u2019s last name. Our last name is Covey\u2014Covey like lovey, not like cove. But the reason we are the Song girls and not the Covey girls is my mom used to say that she was a Song girl for life, and Margot said then we should be too. We all have Song for our middle name, and we look more Song than Covey anyway, more Korean than white. At least Margot and I do; Kitty looks most like Daddy: her hair is light brown like his. People say I look the most like Mommy, but I think Margot does, with her high cheekbones and dark eyes. It\u2019s been almost six years now, and sometimes it feels like just yesterday she was here, and sometimes it feels like she never was, only in dreams.</p><p>She\u2019d mopped the floors that morning; they were shiny and everything smelled like lemons and clean house. The phone was ringing in the kitchen, she came running in to answer it, and she slipped. She hit her head on the floor, and she was unconscious, but then she woke up and she was fine. That was her lucid interval. That\u2019s what they call it. A little while later she said she had a headache, she went to lie down on the couch, and then she didn\u2019t wake up.</p><p>Margot was the one who found her. She was twelve. She took care of everything: she called 911; she called Daddy; she told me to watch over Kitty, who was only three. I turned on the TV for Kitty in the playroom and I sat with her. That\u2019s all I did. I don\u2019t know what I would have done if Margot hadn\u2019t been there. Even though Margot is only two years older than me, I look up to her more than anybody. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When other adults find out that my dad is a single father of three girls, they shake their heads in admiration, like How does he do it? How does he ever manage that all by himself? The answer is Margot. She\u2019s been an organizer from the start, everything labeled and scheduled and arranged in neat, even rows.</p><p>Margot is a good girl, and I guess Kitty and I have followed her lead. I\u2019ve never cheated or gotten drunk or smoked a cigarette or even had a boyfriend. We tease Daddy and say how lucky he is that we\u2019re all so good, but the truth is, we\u2019re the lucky ones. He\u2019s a really good dad. And he tries hard. He doesn\u2019t always understand us, but he tries, and that\u2019s the important thing. We three Song girls have an unspoken pact: to make life as easy as possible for Daddy. But then again, maybe it\u2019s not so unspoken, because how many times have I heard Margot say, \u201cShh, be quiet, Daddy\u2019s taking a nap before he has to go back to the hospital,\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t bother Daddy with that; do it yourself\u201d?</p><p>I\u2019ve asked Margot what she thinks it would have been like if Mommy hadn\u2019t died. Like would we spend more time with our Korean side of the family and not just on Thanksgiving and New Year\u2019s Day? Or\u2014</p><p>Margot doesn\u2019t see the point in wondering. This is our life; there\u2019s no use in asking what if. No one could ever give you the answers. I try, I really do, but it\u2019s hard for me to accept this way of thinking. I\u2019m always wondering about the what-ifs, about the road not taken.</p> <p>Daddy and Kitty come downstairs at the same time. Margot pours Daddy a cup of coffee, black, and I pour milk in Kitty\u2019s cereal bowl. I push it in front of her, and she turns her head away from me and gets a yogurt out of the fridge. She takes it into the living room to eat in front of the TV. So she\u2019s still mad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go to Costco later today, so you girls make a list for whatever you need,\u201d Daddy asks, taking a big sip of coffee. \u201cI think I\u2019ll pick up some New York strips for dinner. We can grill out. Should I get one for Josh, too?\u201d</p><p>My head whips in Margot\u2019s direction. She opens her mouth and closes it. Then she says, \u201cNo, just get enough for the four of us, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>I give her a reproving look, and she ignores me. I\u2019ve never known Margot to chicken out before, but I suppose in matters of the heart, there\u2019s no predicting how a person will or won\u2019t behave.</p><p>3</p> <p>SO NOW IT\u2019S THE LAST days of summer and our last days with Margot. Maybe it\u2019s not altogether such a bad thing that she broke up with Josh; this way we have more time with just us sisters. I\u2019m sure she must have thought of that. I\u2019m sure it was part of the plan.</p><p>We\u2019re driving out of our neighborhood when we see Josh run past. He joined track last year, so now he\u2019s always running. Kitty yells his name, but the windows are up, and it\u2019s no use anyway\u2014he pretends not to hear. \u201cTurn around,\u201d Kitty urges Margot. \u201cMaybe he wants to come with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a Song-girls-only day,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>We spend the rest of the morning at Target, picking up last minute things like Honey Nut Chex mix for the flight and deodorant and hair ties. We let Kitty push the cart so she can do that thing where she gets a running start and then rides the cart like she\u2019s pushing a chariot. Margot only lets her do it a couple of times before she makes her stop, though, so as not to annoy other customers.</p><p>Next we go back home and make chicken salad with green grapes for lunch and then it\u2019s nearly time for Kitty\u2019s swim meet. We pack a picnic dinner of ham-and-cheese sandwiches and fruit salad and bring Margot\u2019s laptop to watch movies on, because swim meets can go long into the night. We make a sign, too, that says Go Kitty Go! I draw a dog on it. Daddy ends up missing the swim meet because he is delivering a baby, and as far as excuses go, it\u2019s a pretty good one. (It was a girl, and they named her Patricia Rose after her two grandmothers. Daddy always finds out the first and middle name for me. It\u2019s the first thing I ask when he gets home from a delivery.)</p><p>Kitty\u2019s so excited about winning two first-place ribbons and one second place that she forgets to ask where Josh is until we\u2019re in the car driving back home. She\u2019s in the backseat and she\u2019s got her towel wrapped around her head like a turban and her ribbons dangling from her ears like earrings. She leans forward and says, \u201cHey! Why didn\u2019t Josh come to my meet?\u201d</p> <p>I can see Margot hesitate, so I answer before she can. Maybe the only thing I\u2019m better at than Margot is lying. \u201cHe had to work at the bookstore tonight. He really wanted to make it, though.\u201d Margot reaches across the console and gives my hand a grateful squeeze.</p><p>Sticking out her lower lip, Kitty says, \u201cThat was the last regular meet! He promised he\u2019d come watch me swim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a last-minute thing,\u201d I say. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t get out of working the shift because one of his coworkers had an emergency.\u201d</p><p>Kitty nods begrudgingly. Little as she is, she understands emergency shifts.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get frozen custards,\u201d Margot says suddenly.</p><p>Kitty lights up, and Josh and his imaginary emergency shift is forgotten. \u201cYeah! I want a waffle cone! Can I get a waffle cone with two scoops? I want mint chip and peanut brittle. No, rainbow sherbet and double fudge. No, wait\u2014\u201d</p><p>I twist around in my seat. \u201cYou can\u2019t finish two scoops and a waffle cone,\u201d I tell her. \u201cMaybe you could finish two scoops in a cup, but not in a cone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can. Tonight I can. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine, but you better finish the whole thing.\u201d I shake my finger at her and say it like a threat, which makes her roll her eyes and giggle. As for me, I\u2019ll get what I always get\u2014the cherry chocolate-chunk custard in a sugar cone.</p><p>Margot pulls into the drive-thru, and as we wait our turn, I say, \u201cI bet they don\u2019t have frozen custard in Scotland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have another one of these until Thanksgiving,\u201d I say.</p><p>Margot looks straight ahead. \u201cChristmas,\u201d she says, correcting me. \u201cThanksgiving\u2019s too short to fly all that way, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanksgiving\u2019s gonna suck.\u201d Kitty pouts.</p><p>I\u2019m silent. We\u2019ve never had a Thanksgiving without Margot. She always does the turkey and the broccoli casserole and the creamed onions. I do the pies (pumpkin and pecan) and the mashed potatoes. Kitty is the taste tester and the table setter. I don\u2019t know how to roast a turkey. And both of our grandmothers will be there, and Nana, Daddy\u2019s mother, likes Margot best of all of us. She says Kitty drains her and I\u2019m too dreamy-eyed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All of a sudden I feel panicky and it\u2019s hard to breathe and I couldn\u2019t care less about cherry chocolate-chunk custard. I can\u2019t picture Thanksgiving without Margot. I can\u2019t even picture next Monday without her. I know most sisters don\u2019t get along, but I\u2019m closer to Margot than I am to anybody in the world. How can we be the Song girls without Margot?</p><p>4</p><p>MY OLDEST FRIEND CHRIS SMOKES, she hooks up with boys she doesn\u2019t know hardly at all, and she\u2019s been suspended twice. One time she had to go before the court for truancy. I never knew what truancy was before I met Chris. FYI, it\u2019s when you skip so much school you\u2019re in trouble with the law.</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure that if Chris and I met each other now, we wouldn\u2019t be friends. We\u2019re as different as different can be. But it wasn\u2019t always this way. In sixth grade Chris liked stationery and sleepovers and staying up all night watching John Hughes movies, just like me. But by eighth grade she was sneaking out after my dad fell asleep to meet boys she met at the mall. They\u2019d drop her back off before it got light outside. I\u2019d stay up until she came back, terrified she wouldn\u2019t make it home before my dad woke up. She always made it back in time though.</p> <p>Chris isn\u2019t the kind of friend you call every night or have lunch with every day. She is like a street cat, she comes and goes as she pleases. She can\u2019t be tied down to a place or a person. Sometimes I won\u2019t see Chris for days and then in the middle of the night there will be a knock at my bedroom window and it\u2019ll be Chris, crouched in the magnolia tree. I keep my window unlocked for her in case. Chris and Margot can\u2019t stand each other. Chris thinks Margot is uptight, and Margot thinks Chris is bipolar. She thinks Chris uses me; Chris thinks Margot controls me. I think maybe they\u2019re both a little bit right. But the important thing, the real thing, is Chris and I understand each other, which I think counts for a lot more than people realize.</p><p>Chris calls me on the way over to our house; she says her mom\u2019s being a beotch and she\u2019s coming over for a couple hours and do we have any food?</p><p>Chris and I are sharing a bowl of leftover gnocchi in the living room when Margot comes home from dropping Kitty off at her swim team\u2019s end-of-season barbecue. \u201cOh, hey,\u201d she says. Then she spots Chris\u2019s glass of Diet Coke on the coffee table, sans coaster. \u201cCan you please use a coaster?\u201d</p><p>As soon as Margot\u2019s up the stairs, Chris says, \u201cGawd! Why is your sister such a beotch?\u201d</p><p>I slide a coaster under her glass. \u201cYou think everyone\u2019s a beotch today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because everyone is.\u201d Chris rolls her eyes toward the ceiling. Loudly, she says, \u201cShe needs to pull that stick out of her ass.\u201d</p><p>From her room Margot yells, \u201cI heard that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant for you to!\u201d Chris yells back, scraping up the last piece of gnocchi for herself.</p><p>I sigh. \u201cShe\u2019s leaving so soon.\u201d</p><p>Snickering, Chris says, \u201cSo is Joshy, like, going to light a candle for her every night until she comes back home?\u201d</p><p>I hesitate. While I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s still supposed to be a secret, I am sure that Margot wouldn\u2019t want Chris knowing any of her personal business. All I say is, \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait a minute. Did she dump him?\u201d Chris demands.</p><p>Reluctantly I nod. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything to her, though,\u201d I warn. \u201cShe\u2019s still really sad about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMargot? Sad?\u201d Chris picks at her nails. \u201cMargot doesn\u2019t have normal human emotions like the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just don\u2019t know her,\u201d I say. \u201cBesides, we can\u2019t all be like you.\u201d</p><p>She grins a toothy grin. She has sharp incisors, which make her look always a little bit hungry. \u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>Chris is pure emotion. She screams at the drop of a hat. She says sometimes you have to scream out emotions; if you don\u2019t, they\u2019ll fester. The other day she screamed at a lady at the grocery store for accidentally stepping on her toes. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s in any danger of her emotions festering.</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t believe that in a few days she\u2019ll be gone,\u201d I say, feeling sniffly all of a sudden.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not dying, Lara Jean. There\u2019s nothing to get all boo-hoo about.\u201d Chris pulls at a loose string on her red shorts. They\u2019re so short that when she\u2019s sitting, you can see her underwear. Which are red to match her shorts. \u201cIn fact, I think this is good for you. It\u2019s about time you did your own thing and stopped just listening to whatever Queen Margot says. This is your junior year, beotch. This is when it\u2019s supposed to get good. French some guys, live a little, you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI live plenty,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYeah, at the nursing home.\u201d Chris snickers and I glare at her.</p><p>Margot started volunteering at the Belleview Retirement Community when she got her driver\u2019s license; it was her job to help host cocktail hour for the residents. I\u2019d help sometimes. We\u2019d set out peanuts and pour drinks and sometimes Margot would play the piano, but usually Stormy hogged that. Stormy is the Belleview diva. She rules the roost. I like listening to her stories. And Miss Mary, she might not be so good at conversation due to her dementia, but she taught me how to knit.</p><p>They have a new volunteer there now, but I know that at Belleview it really is the more the merrier, because most of the residents get so few visitors. I should go back soon; I miss going there. And I for sure don\u2019t appreciate Chris making fun of it.</p><p>\u201cThose people at Belleview have lived more life than everyone we know combined,\u201d I tell her. \u201cThere\u2019s this one lady, Stormy, she was a USO girl! She used to get a hundred letters a day from soldiers who were in love with her. And there was this one veteran who lost his leg\u2014he sent her a diamond ring!\u201d</p><p>Chris looks interested all of a sudden. \u201cDid she keep it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did,\u201d I admit. I think it was wrong of her to keep the ring since she had no intention of marrying him, but she showed it to me, and it was beautiful. It was a pink diamond, very rare. I bet it\u2019s worth so much money now.</p><p>\u201cI guess Stormy sounds kind of like a badass,\u201d Chris says begrudgingly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could come with me to Belleview sometime,\u201d I suggest. \u201cWe could go to their cocktail hour. Mr. Perelli loves to dance with new girls. He\u2019ll teach you how to fox-trot.\u201d</p><p>Chris makes a horrible face like I suggested we go hang out at the town dump. \u201cNo, thanks. How about I take you dancing?\u201d She nudges her chin toward upstairs. \u201cNow that your sister\u2019s leaving, we can have some real fun. You know I always have fun.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s true, Chris does always have fun. Sometimes a little too much fun, but fun nonetheless.</p><p>5</p><p>THE NIGHT BEFORE MARGOT LEAVES, all three of us are in her room helping pack up the last little things. Kitty is organizing Margot\u2019s bath stuff, packing it nice and neat in the clear shower caddy. Margot is trying to decide which coat to bring.</p><p>\u201cShould I bring my peacoat and my puffy coat or just my peacoat?\u201d she asks me.</p> <p>\u201cJust the peacoat,\u201d I say. \u201cYou can dress that up or down.\u201d I\u2019m lying on her bed directing the packing process. \u201cKitty, make sure the lotion cap is on tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s brand-new\u2014course it\u2019s on tight!\u201d Kitty growls, but she double-checks.</p><p>\u201cIt gets cold in Scotland sooner than it does here,\u201d Margot said, folding the coat and setting it on top of her suitcase. \u201cI think I\u2019ll just bring both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you asked if you already knew what you were going to do,\u201d I say. \u201cAlso, I thought you said you were coming home for Christmas. You\u2019re still coming home for Christmas, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, if you\u2019ll stop being a brat,\u201d Margot says.</p> <p>Honestly, Margot isn\u2019t even packing that much. She doesn\u2019t need a lot. If it was me, I\u2019d have packed up my whole room, but not Margot. Her room looks the same, almost.</p><p>Margot sits down next to me, and Kitty climbs up and sits at the foot of the bed. \u201cEverything\u2019s changing,\u201d I say, sighing.</p><p>Margot makes a face and puts her arm around me. \u201cNothing\u2019s changing, not really. We\u2019re the Song girls forever, remember?\u201d</p><p>Our father stands in the doorway. He knocks, even though the door is open and we can clearly see it is him. \u201cI\u2019m going to start packing up the car now,\u201d he announces. We watch from the bed as he lugs one of the suitcases downstairs, and then he comes up for the other one. Drily he says, \u201cOh no, don\u2019t get up. Don\u2019t trouble yourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we won\u2019t,\u201d we sing out.</p><p>For the past week our father has been in spring-cleaning mode, even though it isn\u2019t spring. He\u2019s getting rid of everything\u2014the bread machine we never used, CDs, old blankets, our mother\u2019s old typewriter. It\u2019s all going to Goodwill. A psychiatrist or someone could probably connect it to Margot\u2019s leaving for college, but I can\u2019t explain the exact significance of it. Whatever it is, it\u2019s annoying. I had to shoo him away from my glass-unicorn collection twice.</p> <p>I lay down my head in Margot\u2019s lap. \u201cSo you really are coming home for Christmas, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could come with you.\u201d Kitty pouts. \u201cYou\u2019re nicer than Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>I give her a pinch.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d she crows.</p><p>\u201cLara Jean will be nice,\u201d Margot says, \u201cas long as you behave. And you both have to take care of Daddy. Make sure he doesn\u2019t work too many Saturdays. Make sure he takes the car in for inspection next month. And make sure you buy coffee filters\u2014you\u2019re always forgetting to buy coffee filters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, drill sergeant,\u201d Kitty and I chorus. I search Margot\u2019s face for sadness or fear or worry, for some sign that she is scared to go so far away, that she will miss us as much as we will miss her. I don\u2019t see it, though.</p><p>The three of us sleep in Margot\u2019s room that night.</p> <p>Kitty falls asleep first, as always. I lie in the dark beside her with my eyes open. I can\u2019t sleep. The thought that tomorrow night Margot won\u2019t be in this room\u2014it makes me so sad I can hardly bear it. I hate change more than almost anything.</p><p>In the dark next to me Margot asks, \u201cLara Jean . . . do you think you\u2019ve ever been in love before? Real love?\u201d</p><p>She catches me off guard; I don\u2019t have an answer ready for her. I\u2019m trying to think of one, but she\u2019s already talking again.</p><p>Wistfully, she says, \u201cI wish I\u2019d been in love more than once. I think you should fall in love at least twice in high school.\u201d Then she lets out a little sigh and falls asleep. Margot falls asleep like that\u2014one dreamy sigh and she\u2019s off to never-never land, just like that.</p><p>I wake up in the middle of the night and Margot\u2019s not there. Kitty\u2019s curled up on her side next to me, but no Margot. It\u2019s pitch dark; only the moonlight filters through the curtains. I crawl out of bed and move to the window. My breath catches. There they are: Josh and Margot standing in the driveway. Margot\u2019s face is turned away from him, toward the moon. Josh is crying. They aren\u2019t touching. There\u2019s enough space between them for me to know that Margot hasn\u2019t changed her mind.</p><p>I drop the curtain and find my way back to the bed, where Kitty has rolled farther into the center. I push her back a few inches so there will be room for Margot. I wish I hadn\u2019t seen that. It was too personal. Too real. It was supposed to be just for them. If there was a way for me to unsee it, I would.</p><p>I turn on my side and close my eyes. What must it be like, to have a boy like you so much he cries for you? And not just any boy. Josh. Our Josh.</p><p>To answer her question: yes, I think I have been in real love. Just once, though. With Josh. Our Josh.</p><p>6</p><p>THIS IS HOW MARGOT AND josh got together. In a way I heard about it from Josh first.</p><p>It was two years ago. We were sitting in the library during our free. I was doing math homework; Josh was helping because he\u2019s good at math. We had our heads bent over my page, so close I could smell the soap he\u2019d used that morning. Irish Spring.</p><p>And then he said, \u201cI need your advice on something. I like someone.\u201d</p><p>For a split second I thought it was me. I thought he was going to say me. I hoped. It was the start of the school year. We\u2019d hung out nearly every day that August, sometimes with Margot but mostly just by ourselves, because Margot had her internship at the Montpelier plantation three days a week. We swam a lot. I had a great tan from all the swimming. So for that split second I thought he was going to say my name.</p><p>But then I saw the way he blushed, the way he looked off into space, and I knew it wasn\u2019t for me.</p><p>Mentally, I ran through the list of girls it could be. It was a short list. Josh didn\u2019t hang out with a ton of girls; he had his best friend Jersey Mike, who had moved from New Jersey in middle school, and his other best friend, Ben, and that was it.</p><p>It could have been Ashley, a junior on the volleyball team. He\u2019d once pointed her out as the cutest of all the junior girls. In Josh\u2019s defense, I\u2019d made him do it: I asked him who was the prettiest girl in each grade. For prettiest freshman, my grade, he said Genevieve. Not that I was surprised, but it still gave me a little pinch in my heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It could have been Jodie, the college girl from the bookstore. Josh often talked about how smart Jodie was, how she was so cultured because she\u2019d studied abroad in India and was now Buddhist. Ha! I was the one who was half-Korean; I was the one who\u2019d taught Josh how to eat with chopsticks. He\u2019d had kimchi for the first time at my house.</p><p>I was about to ask him who when the librarian came over to shush us, and then we went back to doing work and Josh didn\u2019t bring it up again and I didn\u2019t ask. Honestly, I didn\u2019t want to know. It wasn\u2019t me, and that was all I cared about.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think for one second that the girl he liked was Margot. Not that I didn\u2019t see her as a girl who could be liked. She\u2019d been asked out before, by a certain type of guy. Smart guys who would partner up with her in chemistry and run against her for student government. In retrospect, it wasn\u2019t so surprising that Josh would like Margot, since he\u2019s that kind of guy too.</p><p>If someone were to ask me what Josh looks like, I would say he\u2019s just ordinary. He looks like the kind of guy you\u2019d expect would be good at computers, the kind of guy who calls comic books graphic novels. Brown hair. Not a special brown, just regular brown. Green eyes that go muddy in the center. He\u2019s on the skinny side, but he\u2019s strong. I know because I sprained my ankle once by the old baseball field and he piggybacked me all the way home. He has freckles, which make him look younger than his age. And a dimple on his left check. I\u2019ve always liked that dimple. He has such a serious face otherwise.</p> <p>What was surprising, what was shocking, was that Margot would like him back. Not because of who Josh was, but because of who Margot was. I\u2019d never heard her talk about liking a boy before, not even once. I was the flighty one, the flibbertigibbet, as my white grandma would say. Not Margot. Margot was above all that. She existed on some higher plane where those things\u2014boys, makeup, clothes\u2014didn\u2019t really matter.</p><p>The way it happened was sudden. Margot came home from school late that day in October; her cheeks were pink from the cold mountainy air and she had her hair in a braid and a scarf around her neck. She\u2019d been working on a project at school, it was dinnertime, and I\u2019d cooked chicken parmesan with thin spaghetti in watery tomato sauce.</p><p>She came into the kitchen and announced, \u201cI have something to tell you.\u201d Her eyes were very bright; I remember she was unspooling the scarf from around her neck.</p><p>Kitty was doing her homework at the kitchen table, Daddy was on his way home, and I was stirring the watery sauce. \u201cWhat?\u201d Kitty and I asked.</p><p>\u201cJosh likes me.\u201d Margot gave a pleased kind of shrug; her shoulders nearly went up to her ears.</p> <p>I went very still. Then I dropped my wooden spoon into the sauce. \u201cJosh Josh? Our Josh?\u201d I couldn\u2019t even look at her. I was afraid that she would see.</p><p>\u201cYes. He waited for me after school today so he could tell me. He said\u2014\u201d Margot grinned ruefully. \u201cHe said I\u2019m his dream girl. Can you believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I said, and I tried to communicate happiness in that word, but I don\u2019t know if it came out that way. All I was feeling was despair. And envy. Envy so thick and so black I felt like I was choking on it. So I tried again, this time with a smile. \u201cWow, Margot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Kitty echoed. \u201cSo are you boyfriend and girlfriend now?\u201d</p><p>I held my breath, waiting for her to answer.</p><p>Margot took a pinch of parmesan between her fingers and dropped it in her mouth. \u201cYeah, I think so.\u201d And then she smiled, and her eyes went all soft and liquid. I understood then that she liked him too. So much.</p> <p>That night I wrote my letter to Josh.</p><p>Dear Josh . . .</p><p>I cried a lot. Just like that, it was over. It was over before I even had a chance. The important thing wasn\u2019t that Josh had chosen Margot. It was that Margot had chosen him.</p><p>So that was that. I cried my eyes out; I wrote my letter; I put the whole thing to rest. I haven\u2019t thought of him that way since. He and Margot are meant to be. They\u2019re MFEO. Made for each other.</p><p>I\u2019m still awake when Margot comes back to bed, but I quickly shut my eyes and pretend to be asleep. Kitty\u2019s cuddled up next to me.</p><p>I hear a snuffly sound and I peek out of one eye to look at Margot. Her back is to us; her shoulders are shaking. She\u2019s crying.</p><p>Margot never cries.</p><p>Now that I\u2019ve seen Margot cry over him, I believe it more than ever\u2014they\u2019re not over.</p> <p>7</p><p>THE NEXT DAY, WE DRIVE margot to the airport. Outside, we load up her suitcases on a luggage carrier\u2014Kitty tries to get on top and dance, but our father pulls her down right away. Margot insists on going in by herself, just like she said she would.</p><p>\u201cMargot, at least let me get your bags checked,\u201d Daddy says, trying to maneuver the luggage carrier around her. \u201cI want to see you go through security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she repeats. \u201cI\u2019ve flown by myself before. I know how to check a bag.\u201d She stretches up on her toes and puts her arms around our dad\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ll call as soon as I get there, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall every day,\u201d I whisper. The lump in my throat is getting bigger, and a few tears leak out of my eyes. I\u2019d hoped I wouldn\u2019t cry, because I knew Margot wouldn\u2019t, and it\u2019s lonely to cry alone, but I can\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare forget us,\u201d Kitty warns.</p><p>That makes Margot smile. \u201cI could never.\u201d She hugs us each one more time. She saves me for last, the way I knew she would. \u201cTake good care of Daddy and Kitty. You\u2019re in charge now.\u201d I don\u2019t want to let go, so I hold on tighter; I\u2019m still waiting and hoping for some sign, some indication that she will miss us as much as we\u2019ll miss her. And then she laughs and I release her.</p><p>\u201cBye, Gogo,\u201d I say, wiping my eyes with a corner of my shirt.</p><p>We all watch as she pushes the luggage carrier over to the check-in counter. I\u2019m crying hard, wiping my tears with the back of my arm. Daddy puts one arm around me and one around Kitty. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait until she\u2019s in line for security,\u201d he says.</p><p>When she\u2019s done checking in, she turns back and looks at us through the glass doors. She lifts one hand and waves, and then she heads for the security line. We watch her go, thinking she might turn around one more time, but she doesn\u2019t. She already seems so far away from us. Straight-A Margot, ever capable. When it\u2019s my time to leave, I doubt I\u2019ll be as strong as Margot. But, honestly, who is? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I cry all the way home. Kitty tells me I\u2019m a bigger baby than she is, but then from the backseat she grabs my hand and squeezes it, and I know she\u2019s sad too.</p><p>Even though Margot isn\u2019t a loud person, it feels quiet at home. Empty, somehow. What will it be like when I\u2019m gone in two years? What will Daddy and Kitty do then? I hate the thought of the two of them coming home to an empty, dark house with no me and no Margot. Maybe I won\u2019t go away far; maybe I\u2019ll even live at home, at least for the first semester. I think that would be the right thing to do.</p><p>8</p><p>LATER THAT AFTERNOON CHRIS CALLS and tells me to meet her at the mall; she wants my opinion on a leather jacket, and to get the full effect I have to see it in person. I\u2019m proud she\u2019s asking for my sartorial advice, and it would be good to get out of the house and not be sad anymore, but I\u2019m nervous about driving to the mall alone. I (or anyone, really) would consider myself a skittish driver.</p> <p>I ask her if she\u2019ll just send me a picture instead, but Chris knows me too well. She says, \u201cNuh-uh. You get your ass down here, Lara Jean. You\u2019ll never get better at driving if you don\u2019t just suck it up and do it.\u201d</p><p>So that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing: I\u2019m driving Margot\u2019s car to the mall. I mean, I have my license and everything; I\u2019m just not very confident. My dad has taken me for lessons numerous times, Margot too, and I\u2019m basically fine with them in the car, but I get nervous when I drive alone. It\u2019s the changing-lanes part that scares me. I don\u2019t like taking my eyes away from what\u2019s happening right in front of me, not for a second. Also I don\u2019t like going too fast.</p><p>But the worst thing is I have a tendency of getting lost. The only places I can get to with absolute certainty are school and the grocery store. I\u2019ve never had to know how to get to the mall, because Margot always drove us there. But now I have to do better, because I\u2019m responsible for driving Kitty around. Though truthfully, Kitty is better with directions than I am; she knows how to get to loads of places. But I don\u2019t want to have to hear her tell me how to get somewhere. I want to feel like the big sister; I want her to relax in the passenger seat, safe in the knowledge that Lara Jean will get her where she needs to go, just like I did with Margot.</p><p>Sure, I could just use a GPS, but I would feel silly putting in directions to go to the mall when I\u2019ve been there a million times. It should come to me intuitively, easy, where I don\u2019t even have to think about it. Instead I worry over every turn, second-guess every highway sign\u2014is it north or is it south, do I turn right here or is it the next one? I\u2019ve never had to pay attention.</p><p>But today, so far so good. I\u2019m listening to the radio, bopping along, even driving with just one hand on the wheel. I do this to feign confidence, because the more I fake it, the more it\u2019s supposed to feel true.</p> <p>Everything is going so well that I take the shortcut way instead of the highway way. I cut through the side neighborhood, and even as I\u2019m doing it, I\u2019m wondering if this was such a great idea. After a couple of minutes things aren\u2019t looking so familiar, and I realize I should have taken a left instead of a right. I push down the panic that\u2019s rising in my chest and I try to backtrack.</p><p>You can do it, you can do it.</p><p>There\u2019s a four-way stop sign. I don\u2019t see anyone, so I zip ahead. I don\u2019t even see the car on my right; I feel it before I see it.</p><p>I scream my head off. I taste copper in my mouth. Am I bleeding? Did I bite my tongue off? I touch it and it\u2019s still there. My heart is racing; my whole body feels wet and clammy. I try to take deep breaths, but I can\u2019t seem to get air.</p><p>My legs shake as I get out of the car. The other guy is already out, inspecting his car with his arms crossed. He\u2019s old, older than my dad, and he has gray hair, and he\u2019s wearing shorts with red lobsters on them. His car is fine; mine has a huge dent in the side. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see the stop sign?\u201d he demands. \u201cWere you texting on your phone?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head; my throat is closing up. I just don\u2019t want to cry. As long as I don\u2019t cry . . .</p> <p>He seems to sense this. The irritated furrow of his brow is loosening. \u201cWell, my car looks fine,\u201d he says reluctantly. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>I nod again. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cKids need to be more careful,\u201d the man says, as if I haven\u2019t spoken.</p><p>The lump in my throat is getting bigger. \u201cI\u2019m very, very sorry, sir.\u201d</p><p>He makes a grunty sound. \u201cYou should call someone to come get you,\u201d the man says. \u201cDo you want me to wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d What if he\u2019s a serial killer or a child molester? I don\u2019t want to be alone with a strange man.</p><p>The man drives off.</p><p>As soon as he\u2019s gone, it occurs to me that maybe I should have called the police while he was still here. Aren\u2019t you always supposed to call the police when you\u2019re in a car accident, no matter what? I\u2019m pretty sure they told us that in driver\u2019s ed. So that\u2019s another mistake I made.</p> <p>I sit down on the curb and stare at Margot\u2019s car. I\u2019ve only had it for two hours and I\u2019ve already wrecked it. I rest my head in my lap and sit in a tight bundle. My neck is starting to ache. This is when the tears start. My dad is not going to be happy. Margot is not going to be happy. They\u2019ll both probably agree that I have no business driving around town unsupervised, and maybe they\u2019re right. Driving a car is a lot of responsibility. Maybe I\u2019m not ready for it yet. Maybe I\u2019ll never be ready. Maybe even when I\u2019m old, my sisters or my dad will have to drive me around, because that\u2019s how useless I am.</p><p>I pull out my phone and call Josh. When he answers, I say, \u201cJosh, can you do me a f-f-favor?\u201d and my voice comes out so wobbly I\u2019m embarrassed.</p><p>Which of course he hears, because he\u2019s Josh. He comes to attention immediately and says, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got into a car accident. I don\u2019t even know where I am. Can you come get me?\u201d Wobble wobble.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d he demands.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just\u2014\u201d If I say another word, I will cry.</p><p>\u201cWhat street signs do you see? What stores?\u201d</p><p>I crane my neck to look. \u201cFalstone,\u201d I say. I look for the closet mailbox. \u201cI\u2019m at 8109 Falstone Road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way. Do you want me to stay on the phone with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay.\u201d I hang up and start to cry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve been sitting there crying when another car rolls up in front of me. I look up, and it\u2019s Peter Kavinsky\u2019s black Audi with the tinted windows. One of them rolls down. \u201cLara Jean? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod my head yes and make a motion like he should just go. He rolls the window back up, and I think he\u2019s really going to drive off, but then he pulls over to the side and parks. He climbs out and starts inspecting my car. \u201cYou really messed it up,\u201d he says. \u201cDid you get the other guy\u2019s insurance info?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, his car was fine.\u201d Furtively, I wipe my cheeks with my arm. \u201cIt was my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have Triple A?\u201d</p> <p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cSo you called them already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But someone\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>Peter sits down next to me. \u201cHow long have you been sitting here crying by yourself?\u201d</p><p>I turn my head and wipe my face again. \u201cI\u2019m not crying.\u201d</p> <p>Peter Kavinsky and I used to be friends, back before he was Kavinsky, when he was Peter K. There was a whole gang of us in middle school. The boys were Peter Kavinsky and John Ambrose McClaren and Trevor Pike. The girls were Genevieve and me and Allie Feldman who lived down the block and sometimes Chris. Growing up, Genevieve lived two streets away from me. It\u2019s funny how much of childhood is about proximity. Like who your best friend is is directly correlated to how close your houses are; who you sit next to in music is all about how close your names are in the alphabet. Such a game of chance. In eighth grade Genevieve moved to a different neighborhood, and we stayed friends a little while longer. She\u2019d come back to the neighborhood to hang out, but something was different. By high school Genevieve had eclipsed us. She was still friends with the boys, but the girls\u2019 crew was over. Allie and I stayed friends until she moved last year, but there was always something just a little bit humiliating about it, like we were two leftover heels of bread and together we made a dry sandwich.</p><p>We\u2019re not friends anymore. Me and Genevieve or me and Peter. Which is why it\u2019s so weird to be sitting next to him on somebody\u2019s curb like no time has passed.</p><p>His phone buzzes and he takes it out of his pocket. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d</p><p>I sniffle. \u201cWhere are you headed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Gen\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better get going then,\u201d I say. \u201cGenevieve will be mad if you\u2019re late.\u201d</p> <p>Peter makes a pfft sound, but he sure does get up fast. I wonder what it\u2019s like to have that much power over a boy. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want it; it\u2019s a lot of responsibility to hold a person\u2019s heart in your hands. He\u2019s getting into his car when, as an afterthought, he turns around and asks, \u201cWant me to call Triple A for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay,\u201d I say. \u201cThanks for stopping, though. That was really nice of you.\u201d</p><p>Peter grins. I remember that about Peter\u2014how much he likes positive reinforcement. \u201cDo you feel better now?\u201d</p><p>I nod. I do, actually.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he says.</p><p>He has the look of a Handsome Boy from a different time. He could be a dashing World War I soldier, handsome enough for a girl to wait years for him to come back from war, so handsome she could wait forever. He could be wearing a red letterman\u2019s jacket, driving around in a Corvette with the top down, one arm on the steering wheel, on his way to pick up his girl for the sock hop. Peter\u2019s kind of wholesome good looks feel more like yesterday than today. There\u2019s just something about him girls like.</p><p>He was my first kiss. It\u2019s so strange to think of it now. It feels like forever ago, but really it was just four years.</p><p>Josh shows up about a minute later, as I\u2019m texting Chris that I\u2019m not going to make it to the mall after all. I stand up. \u201cIt took you long enough!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou told me 8109. This is 8901!\u201d</p><p>Confidently I say, \u201cNo, I definitely said 8901.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you definitely said 8109. And why weren\u2019t you answering your phone?\u201d Josh gets out of his car, and when he sees the side of my car, his jaw drops. \u201cHoly crap. Did you call Triple A yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Can you?\u201d</p><p>Josh does, and then we sit in his car in the air-conditioning while we wait. I almost get into the backseat, when I remember. Margot isn\u2019t here anymore. I\u2019ve ridden in his car so many times, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever once sat up front in the passenger seat.</p><p>\u201cUm . . . you know Margot\u2019s going to kill you, right?\u201d</p><p>I whip my head around so fast my hair slaps me in the face. \u201cMargot\u2019s not going to find out, so don\u2019t you say a word!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen would I even talk to her? We\u2019re broken up, remember?\u201d</p><p>I frown at him. \u201cI hate when people do that\u2014when you ask them to keep something a secret and instead of saying yes or no, they say, \u2018Who would I tell?\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say, \u2018Who would I tell?\u2019!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust say yes or no and mean it. Don\u2019t make it conditional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell Margot anything,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019ll just be between you and me. I promise. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I say. And then it gets quiet with neither of us saying anything; there\u2019s just the sound of cool air coming out of the A/C vents.</p><p>My stomach feels queasy thinking about how I\u2019m going to tell my dad. Maybe I should break the news to him with tears in my eyes so he feels sorry for me. Or I could say something like, I have good news and bad news. The good news is, I\u2019m fine, not a scratch on me. The bad news is, the car is wrecked. Maybe \u201cwrecked\u201d isn\u2019t the right word.</p><p>I\u2019m mulling over the right word choice in my head when Josh says, \u201cSo just because Margot and I broke up, you\u2019re not going to talk to me anymore either?\u201d Josh sounds jokingly bitter or bitterly joking, if there is such a combination.</p><p>I look over at him in surprise. \u201cDon\u2019t be dumb. Of course I\u2019m still going to talk to you. Just not in public.\u201d This is the role I play with him. The part of the pesky little sister. As if I am the same as Kitty. As if we aren\u2019t only a year apart. Josh doesn\u2019t crack a smile, he just looks glum, so I bump my forehead against his. \u201cThat was a joke, dummy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she tell you she was going to do it? I mean, was it always her plan?\u201d When I hesitate, he says, \u201cCome on. I know she tells you everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Not this time anyway. Honestly, Josh. I didn\u2019t know a thing about it. Promise.\u201d I cross my heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Josh absorbs this. Chewing on his bottom lip he says, \u201cMaybe she\u2019ll change her mind. That\u2019s possible, right?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s more heartless for me to say yes or no, because he\u2019ll be hurt either way. Because while I\u2019m 99.99999 percent sure that she will get back together with him, there\u2019s that tiny chance she won\u2019t, and I don\u2019t want to get his hopes up. So I don\u2019t say anything.</p><p>He swallows, his Adam\u2019s apple bobbing up and down. \u201cNo, you\u2019re right. When Margot makes up her mind, she doesn\u2019t go back on it.\u201d</p><p>Please please please don\u2019t cry.</p> <p>I rest my head on his shoulder and say, \u201cYou never know, Joshy.\u201d</p><p>Josh stares straight ahead. A squirrel is darting up the big oak tree in the yard. Up and down and back up again. We both watch. \u201cWhat time does she land?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs . . . is she coming home for Thanksgiving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They don\u2019t get off for Thanksgiving. It\u2019s Scotland, Josh. They don\u2019t celebrate American holidays, hello!\u201d I\u2019m teasing again, but my heart\u2019s not in it.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he says.</p><p>I say, \u201cShe\u2019ll be home for Christmas, though,\u201d and we both sigh.</p><p>\u201cCan I still hang out with you guys?\u201d Josh asks me.</p><p>\u201cMe and Kitty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d I assure him.</p> <p>Josh looks relieved. \u201cGood. I\u2019d hate to lose you, too.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he says it, my heart does this pause, and I forget to breathe, and just for that one second I\u2019m dizzy. And then, just as quickly as it came, the feeling, the strange flutter in my chest, is gone, and the tow truck arrives.</p><p>When we pull into my driveway, he says, \u201cDo you want me to be there when you tell your dad?\u201d</p><p>I brighten up and then I remember how Margot said I\u2019m in charge now. I\u2019m pretty sure taking responsibility for one\u2019s mistakes is part of being in charge.</p><p>9</p><p>DADDY ISN\u2019T SO MAD AFTER all. I go through my whole good news\u2013bad news spiel and he just sighs and says, \u201cAs long as you\u2019re all right.\u201d</p><p>The car needs a special part that has to be flown in from Indiana or Idaho, I can\u2019t remember which. In the meantime I\u2019ll have to share the car with Daddy and take the bus to school or ask Josh for rides, which was already my plan.</p><p>Margot calls later that night. Kitty and I are watching TV and I scream for Daddy to come quick. We sit on the couch and pass the phone around and take turns talking to her.</p> <p>\u201cMargot, guess what happened today!\u201d Kitty shouts.</p><p>Frantically, I shake my head at her. Don\u2019t tell her about the car, I mouth. I give her warning eyes.</p><p>\u201cLara Jean got into . . .\u201d Kitty pauses tantalizingly. \u201cA fight with Daddy. Yeah, she was mean to me and Daddy told her to be nice, so they had a fight.\u201d</p><p>I grab the phone out of her hand. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a fight, Gogo. Kitty\u2019s just being annoying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you guys have for dinner? Did you cook the chicken I defrosted last night?\u201d Margot asks. Her voice sounds so far away.</p><p>I push the volume up on the phone. \u201cYes, but never mind about that. Are you settled into your room? Is it big? What\u2019s your roommate like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s nice. She\u2019s from London and she has a really fancy accent. Her name is Penelope St. George-Dixon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGosh, even her name sounds fancy,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat about your room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe room is about the same as that dorm we saw at UVA; it\u2019s just older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost midnight. We\u2019re five hours ahead, remember?\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re five hours ahead, like she\u2019s already considering Scotland her home, and she\u2019s only been gone a day, not even! \u201cWe miss you already,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cMiss you too.\u201d</p><p>After dinner I text Chris to see if she wants to come over, but she doesn\u2019t text back. She\u2019s probably out with one of the guys she hooks up with. Which is fine. I should catch up on my scrapbooking.</p><p>I was hoping to be done with Margot\u2019s scrapbook before she left for college, but as anyone who\u2019s ever scrapbooked knows, Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day. You could spend a year or more working on one scrapbook.</p><p>I\u2019ve got Motown girl-group music playing, and my supplies are laid out all around me in a semicircle. My heart hole punch, pages and pages of scrapbook paper, pictures I\u2019ve cut out of magazines, glue gun, my tape dispenser with all my different colored washi tapes. Souvenirs like the playbill from when we saw Wicked in New York, receipts, pictures. Ribbon, buttons, stickers, charms. A good scrapbook has texture. It\u2019s thick and chunky and doesn\u2019t close all the way.</p><p>I\u2019m working on a Josh-and-Margot page. I don\u2019t care what Margot says. They\u2019re getting back together, I know it. And even if they aren\u2019t, not right away, it\u2019s not like Margot can just erase him from her history. He was such a big part of her senior year. And, like, her life. The only compromise I\u2019m willing to make is I was saving my heart washi tape for this page, but I can just do a regular plaid tape instead. But then I put the plaid tape up against the pictures and the colors don\u2019t look as good.</p><p>So I go ahead and use the heart tape. And then, swaying to the music, I use my heart template to cut out a picture of the two of them at prom. Margot\u2019s going to love this.</p><p>I\u2019m carefully gluing a dried rose petal from Margot\u2019s corsage when my dad raps on the door. \u201cWhat are you up to tonight?\u201d he asks me.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d I say, gluing another petal. \u201cIf I keep at it, it\u2019ll probably be done by Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d My dad doesn\u2019t move. He just hovers there in the doorway, watching me work. \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to watch that new Ken Burns documentary in a bit, if you want to join me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say, just to be nice. It\u2019ll be too much of a pain to bring all my supplies downstairs and get set up again. I\u2019m in a good rhythm right now. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get it started without me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll righty. I\u2019ll leave you to it, then.\u201d Daddy shuffles down the stairs.</p><p>It takes me most of the night, but I finish the Josh-and-Margot page, and it comes out really nice. Next is a sister page. For this one I use flowered paper for the background, and I glue in a picture of the three of us from a long time ago. Mommy took it. We\u2019re standing in front of the oak tree in front of our house in our church clothes. We\u2019re all wearing white dresses, and we have matching pink ribbons in our hair. The best thing about the picture is Margot and I are smiling sweetly and Kitty is picking her nose. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I smile to myself. Kitty\u2019s going to pitch a fit when she sees this page. I can\u2019t wait.</p><p>10</p><p>MARGOT SAYS THAT JUNIOR YEAR is the most important year, the busiest year, a year so crucial that everything else in life hinges upon it. So I figure I should get in all the pleasure reading I can before school starts next week and junior year officially begins. I\u2019m sitting on my front steps, reading a 1980s romantic British spy novel I got for seventy-five cents at the Friends of the Library sale.</p><p>I\u2019m just getting to the good stuff (Cressida must seduce Nigel to gain access to the spy codes!) when Josh walks out of his house to get the mail. He sees me too; he lifts his hand like he\u2019s just going to wave and not come over, but then he does.</p> <p>\u201cHey, nice onesie,\u201d he says as he makes his way across the driveway.</p><p>It\u2019s faded light blue with sunflowers and it ties around the neck. I got it from the vintage store, 75 percent off. And it\u2019s not a onesie. \u201cThis is a sunsuit,\u201d I tell him, going back to my book. I try to subtly hide the cover with my hand. The last thing I need is Josh giving me a hard time for reading a trashy book when I\u2019m just trying to enjoy a relaxing afternoon.</p><p>I can feel him looking at me, his arms crossed, waiting. I look up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna see a movie tonight at the Bess? There\u2019s a Pixar movie playing. We can take Kitty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, text me when you want to head over,\u201d I say, turning the page of my book. Nigel is unbuttoning Cressida\u2019s blouse and she\u2019s wondering when the sleeping pill she slipped in his Merlot will kick in, while simultaneously hoping it won\u2019t kick in too soon, because Nigel is actually quite a good kisser.</p> <p>Josh reaches down and tries to get a closer look at my book. I slap his hand away, but not before he reads out loud, \u201cCressida\u2019s heart raced as Nigel moved his hand along her stockinged thigh.\u201d Josh cracks up. \u201cWhat the heck are you reading?\u201d</p><p>My cheeks are burning. \u201cOh, be quiet.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, Josh backs away. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to Cressida and Noel then.\u201d</p><p>To his back, I call out, \u201cFor your information, it\u2019s Nigel!\u201d</p><p>Kitty\u2019s over the moon about hanging out with Josh. When Josh asks the girl at the concession stand to layer the butter on the popcorn (bottom, middle, top), we both give an approving nod. Kitty sits in the middle of us, and at the funny parts she laughs so hard she kicks her legs up in the air. She weighs so little that the seat keeps tipping up. Josh and I share smiles over her head.</p><p>Whenever Josh, Margot, and I went to the movies, Margot always sat in the middle too. It was so she could whisper to both of us. She never wanted me to feel left out because she had a boyfriend and I didn\u2019t. She was so careful about this that it made me worry at first, that she sensed something from before. But she\u2019s not someone to hold back or pretty up the truth. She\u2019s just a really good big sister. The best.</p> <p>There were times I felt left out anyway. Not in a romantic way, but a friend way. Josh and I had always been friends. But those times when he\u2019d put his arm around Margot when we were in line for popcorn, or in the car when they\u2019d talk softly to each other and I felt like the kid in the backseat who can\u2019t hear what the adults are talking about, it made me feel a little bit invisible. They made me wish I had someone to whisper to in the backseat.</p><p>It\u2019s strange to be the one in the front seat now. The view isn\u2019t so different from the backseat. In fact, everything feels good and normal and the same, which is a comfort.</p><p>Chris calls me later that night while I\u2019m painting my toenails different-colored pinks. It\u2019s so loud in the background she has to yell. \u201cGuess what!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I can barely hear you!\u201d I\u2019m doing my pinky toe a fruit-punch color called Hit Me with Your Best Shot.</p><p>\u201cHold up.\u201d I can hear Chris moving rooms, because it gets quieter. \u201cCan you hear me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess who broke up.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve moved on to a mod pink color that looks like Wite-Out with a drop of red in it. \u201cWho?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGen and Kavinsky! She dumped his ass.\u201d</p><p>My eyes go huge. \u201cWhoa! Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently, she met some UVA guy at that hostessing job she had. I guarantee you she was cheating on Kavinsky the whole summer.\u201d A guy calls Chris\u2019s name, and Chris says, \u201cI gotta go. It\u2019s my turn at bocce.\u201d Chris hangs up without saying good-bye, which is her way.</p><p>I actually met Chris through Genevieve. They\u2019re cousins: their moms are sisters. Chris used to come over sometimes when we were little, but she and Gen didn\u2019t get along even back then. They\u2019d argue over whose Barbie had dibs on Ken, because there was only one Ken. I didn\u2019t even try to fight for Ken, even though he was technically mine. Well, Margot\u2019s. At school some people don\u2019t even know Gen and Chris are cousins. They don\u2019t look alike, like at all: Gen is petite with fit arms and sunny blond hair the color of margarine. Chris is blond too, but peroxide blond, and she\u2019s taller and has broad swimmer\u2019s shoulders. Still, there is a sameness to them.</p><p>Chris was pretty wild our freshman year. She went to every party, got drunk, hooked up with older boys. That year a junior guy from the lacrosse team told everyone that Chris had sex with him in the boys\u2019 locker room, and it wasn\u2019t even true. Genevieve made Peter threaten to kick his ass if he didn\u2019t tell everybody the truth. I thought it was a really nice thing Genevieve did for Chris, but Chris insisted that Gen had only done it so people wouldn\u2019t think she was related to a slut. After that Chris stopped hanging out and pretty much did her own thing, with people from another school.</p><p>She still has that freshman-year reputation though. She acts like she doesn\u2019t care, but I know she does, at least a little.</p><p>11</p><p>ON SUNDAY, DADDY MAKES LASAGNA. He does that thing where he puts black-bean salsa in it to jazz it up, and it sounds gross but it\u2019s actually good and you don\u2019t notice the beans. Josh comes over too, and he has three helpings, which Daddy loves. When Margot\u2019s name comes up over dinner, I look over at Josh and see how stiff he gets, and I feel sorry for him. Kitty must notice too, because she changes the subject over to dessert, which is a batch of peanut-butter brownies I baked earlier in the afternoon.</p><p>Since Daddy cooked, us kids have kitchen duty. He uses every pot in the kitchen when he makes lasagna, so it\u2019s the worst cleanup, but worth it.</p><p>After, the three of us are relaxing in the TV room. It\u2019s Sunday night, but there\u2019s not that Sunday night feeling in the air, because tomorrow is Labor Day and we have one last day before school starts. Kitty\u2019s working on her dog collage, quelle surprise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat kind do you want most of all?\u201d Josh asks her.</p><p>Kitty answers back lightning fast. \u201cAn Akita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy or girl?\u201d</p><p>Again her answer is prompt. \u201cBoy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll you name him?\u201d</p><p>Kitty hesitates, and I know why. I roll over and tickle Kitty\u2019s bare foot. \u201cI know what you\u2019ll name him,\u201d I say in a singsong voice.</p><p>\u201cBe quiet, Lara Jean!\u201d she screeches.</p><p>I have Josh\u2019s full attention now. \u201cCome on, tell us,\u201d Josh begs.</p><p>I look at Kitty and she is giving me evil glowy red eyes. \u201cNever mind,\u201d I say, feeling nervous all of a sudden. Kitty might be the baby of the family, but she is not someone to trifle with.</p> <p>Then Josh tugs on my ponytail and says, \u201cAw, come on, Lara Jean! Don\u2019t leave us in suspense.\u201d</p><p>I prop myself up on my elbows, and Kitty tries to put her hand over my mouth. Giggling, I say, \u201cIt\u2019s after a boy she likes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Lara Jean, shut up!\u201d</p><p>Kitty kicks me, and in doing so she accidentally rips one of her dog pictures. She lets out a cry and drops to her knees and examines it. Her face is red with the effort of not crying. I feel like such a jerk. I sit up and try to give her an I\u2019m sorry hug, but she twists away from me and kicks at my legs, so hard I yelp. I pick the picture up and try to tape it back, but before I can, Kitty snatches it out of my hands and gives it to Josh. \u201cJosh, fix it,\u201d she says. \u201cLara Jean ruined it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitty, I was only teasing,\u201d I say lamely. I wasn\u2019t going to say the name of the boy. I would never ever have said it.</p><p>She ignores me, and Josh smooths the paper back out with a coaster, and with the concentration of a surgeon he tapes the two pieces together. He wipes his brow. \u201cPhew. I think this one will make it.\u201d</p> <p>I clap, and I try to catch Kitty\u2019s eye, but she won\u2019t look at me. I know I deserve it. The boy Kitty has a crush on\u2014it\u2019s Josh.</p><p>Kitty whisks her collage away from Josh. Stiffly she says, \u201cI\u2019m going upstairs to work on this. Good night, Josh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, Kitty,\u201d Josh says.</p><p>Meekly, I say, \u201cGood night, Kitty,\u201d but she\u2019s already running up the stairs, and she doesn\u2019t reply.</p><p>When we hear the sound of her bedroom door closing, Josh turns to me and says, \u201cYou\u2019re in so much trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say. I\u2019ve got a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. Why did I do that? Even as I was doing it, I knew it was wrong. Margot would never have done that to me. That\u2019s not how big sisters are supposed to treat their little sisters, especially not when I\u2019m so much older than Kitty.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this kid she likes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a boy from school.\u201d</p> <p>Josh sighs. \u201cIs she really old enough to have crushes on boys? I feel like she\u2019s too young for all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had crushes on boys when I was nine,\u201d I tell him. I\u2019m still thinking about Kitty. I wonder how I can make it so she isn\u2019t mad at me anymore. Somehow I don\u2019t think snickerdoodles will cut it this time.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Josh asks me.</p><p>\u201cWho what?\u201d Maybe if I can somehow convince Daddy to buy her a puppy . . .</p><p>\u201cWho was your first crush?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. My first real crush?\u201d I had kindergarten and first- and second-grade crushes aplenty, but they don\u2019t really count. \u201cLike the first one that really mattered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . I guess Peter Kavinsky.\u201d</p><p>Josh practically gags. \u201cKavinsky? Are you kidding me? He\u2019s so obvious. I thought you\u2019d be into someone more . . . I don\u2019t know, subtle. Peter Kavinsky\u2019s such a clich\u00e9. He\u2019s like a cardboard cutout of a \u2018cool guy\u2019 in a movie about high school.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cYou asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he says, shaking his head. \u201cJust . . . wow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe used to be different. I mean, he was still very Peter, but less so.\u201d When Josh looks unconvinced, I say, \u201cYou\u2019re a boy, so you can\u2019t understand what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I don\u2019t understand!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re the one who had a crush on Ms. Rothschild!\u201d</p><p>Josh turns red. \u201cShe was really pretty back then!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d I give him a knowing look. \u201cShe was really \u2018pretty.\u2019?\u201d Our across-the-street neighbor Ms. Rothschild used to mow her lawn in terry-cloth short shorts and a string bikini top. The neighborhood boys would conveniently come and play in Josh\u2019s yard on those days.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Ms. Rothschild wasn\u2019t my first crush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You were.\u201d</p><p>It takes me a few seconds to process this. Even then, all I can manage is, \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I first moved here, before I knew your true personality.\u201d I kick him in the shin for that, and he yelps. \u201cI was twelve and you were eleven. I let you ride my scooter, remember? That scooter was my pride and joy. I saved up for it for two birthdays. And I let you take it for a ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were just being generous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou crashed it and you got a big scratch on the side,\u201d he continues. \u201cRemember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember you cried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t cry. I was justifiably upset. And that was the end of my little crush.\u201d Josh gets up to go and we walk to the foyer.</p><p>Before he opens the front door, Josh turns around and says to me, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if you hadn\u2019t been around after . . . Margot dumped me.\u201d A blush blooms pink across his face, underneath each sweetly freckled cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re keeping me going, Lara Jean.\u201d Josh looks at me and I feel it all, every memory, every moment we\u2019ve ever shared. Then he gives me a quick, fierce hug and disappears into the night.</p><p>I\u2019m standing there in the open door and the thought flies in my head, so quick, so unexpected, I can\u2019t stop myself from thinking it: If you were mine, I would never have broken up with you, not in a million years.</p><p>12</p><p>THIS IS HOW WE MET josh. We were having a teddy-bear, tea-party picnic on the back lawn with real tea and muffins. It had to be in the backyard so no one would see. I was eleven, way too old for it, and Margot was thirteen, way, way too old. I got the idea in my head because I read about it in a book. Because of Kitty I could pretend it was for her and persuade Margot into playing with us. Mommy had died the year before and ever since, Margot rarely said no to anything if it was for Kitty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We had everything spread out on Margot\u2019s old baby blanket, which was blue and nubby with a squirrel print. I laid out a chipped tea set of Margot\u2019s, mini muffins studded with blueberries and granules of sugar that I made Daddy buy at the grocery store, and a teddy bear for each of us. We were all wearing hats, because I insisted. \u201cYou have to wear a hat to a tea party,\u201d I kept saying until Margot finally put hers on just so I\u2019d stop. She had on Mommy\u2019s straw gardening hat, and Kitty was wearing a tennis visor, and I\u2019d fancied up an old fur hat of Grandma\u2019s by pinning a few plastic flowers on top.</p><p>I was pouring lukewarm tea out of the thermos and into cups when Josh climbed up on the fence and watched us. The month before, from the upstairs playroom, we\u2019d watched Josh\u2019s family move in. We\u2019d hoped for girls, but then we saw the movers unload a boy bike and we went back to playing.</p><p>Josh sat up on the fence, not saying anything, and Margot was really stiff and embarrassed; her cheeks were red, but she kept her hat on. Kitty was the one to call out to him. \u201cHello, boy,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said. His hair was shaggy, and he kept shaking it out of his eyes. He was wearing a red T-shirt with a hole in the shoulder.</p> <p>Kitty asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should play with us, Josh,\u201d Kitty commanded.</p><p>So he did.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know it then, how important this boy would become to me and to the people I love the most. But even if I had known, what could I have done differently? It was never going to be me and him. Even though.</p> <p>13</p><p>I THOUGHT I WAS OVER him.</p><p>When I wrote my letter, when I said my good-byes, I meant it, I swear I did. It wasn\u2019t even that hard, not really. Not when I thought about how much Margot liked him, how much she cared. How could I begrudge Margot a first love? Margot, who\u2019d sacrificed so much for all of us. She always, always put Kitty and me before herself. Letting go of Josh was my way of putting Margot first.</p><p>But now, sitting here alone in my living room, with my sister four thousand miles away and Josh next door, all I can think is, Josh Sanderson, I liked you first. By all rights, you were mine. And if it had been me, I\u2019d have packed you in my suitcase and taken you with me, or, you know what, I would have stayed. I would have never left you. Not in a million years, not for anything.</p><p>Thinking these kinds of thoughts, feeling these kinds of feelings, it\u2019s more than disloyal. I know that. It\u2019s downright traitorous. It makes my soul feel dirty. Margot\u2019s been gone less than a week and look at me, how fast I cave. How fast I covet. I\u2019m a betrayer of the worst kind, because I\u2019m betraying my own sister, and there\u2019s no greater betrayal than that. But what now? What am I supposed to do with all these feelings?</p><p>I suppose there\u2019s only one thing I can do. I\u2019ll write him another letter. A postscript with as many pages as it takes to X away whatever feelings I have left for him. I\u2019ll put this whole thing to rest, once and for all.</p> <p>I go to my room and I find my special writing pen, the one with the really smooth inky-black ink. I take out my heavy writing paper, and I begin to write.</p><p>P.S. I still love you.</p><p>I still love you and that\u2019s a really huge problem for me and it\u2019s also a really huge surprise. I swear I didn\u2019t know. All this time, I thought I was over it. How could I not be, when it\u2019s Margot you love? It\u2019s always been Margot . . .</p><p>When I\u2019m done, I put the letter in my diary instead of in my hat box. I have a feeling I\u2019m not done-done yet, that there\u2019s still more I need to say, I just haven\u2019t thought of it yet.</p><p>14</p><p>KITTY\u2019S STILL MAD AT ME. In the wake of the Josh revelation, I\u2019d forgotten all about Kitty. She ignores me all morning, and when I ask if she wants me to take her to the store for school supplies, she snaps, \u201cWith what car? You wrecked Margot\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. \u201cI was going to take Daddy\u2019s when he comes back from Home Depot.\u201d I back away from her, far enough away that she can\u2019t lash out at me with a kick or a hit. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be nasty, Katherine.\u201d</p><p>Kitty practically growls, which is exactly the reaction I was hoping for. I hate when Kitty goes mad and silent. But then she flounces away, and with her back to me she says, \u201cI\u2019m not speaking to you. You know what you did, so don\u2019t bother trying to get back on my good side.\u201d I follow her around, trying to provoke her into talking to me, but there\u2019s really no use. I\u2019ve been dismissed. So I give up and go back to my room and put on the Mermaids soundtrack. I\u2019m organizing my first-week back-to-school outfits on my bed when I get a text from Josh. A little thrill runs up my spine to see his name on my phone, but I sternly remind myself of my vow. He is still Margot\u2019s, not yours. It doesn\u2019t matter that they\u2019re broken up. He was hers first, which means he\u2019s hers always.</p> <p>Wanna go for a bike ride on that trail by the park?</p><p>Biking is a Margot-type activity. She loves going on trails and hikes and bikes. Not me. Josh knows it too. I don\u2019t even own my own bike anymore, and Margot\u2019s is too big for me. Kitty\u2019s is more my size.</p><p>I write back that I can\u2019t; I have to help my dad around the house. It\u2019s not a total lie. My dad did ask me to help him repot some of his plants. And I said only if he was making me and if I had no say in the matter, then sure.</p><p>What does he need help with?</p><p>What to say? I have to be careful about my excuses; Josh can easily look out the window and see if I\u2019m home or not. I text back a vague Just some random chores. Knowing Josh, he would show up with a shovel or a rake or whatever tool the chore entailed. And then he\u2019d stay for dinner, because he always stays for dinner.</p><p>He said I was keeping him going. Me, Lara Jean. I want to be that person for him, I want to be the one who keeps him going during this difficult time. I want to be his lighthouse keeper while we wait for Margot\u2019s return. But it\u2019s hard. Harder than I thought.</p><p>15</p><p>I WAKE UP HAPPY BECAUSE it\u2019s the first day of school. I\u2019ve always loved the first day of school better than the last day of school. Firsts are best because they are beginnings.</p><p>While Daddy and Kitty are upstairs washing up, I make whole-wheat pancakes with sliced bananas, Kitty\u2019s favorite. First-day-of-school breakfast was always a big thing with my mom, and then Margot took over, and now I guess it\u2019s my turn. The pancakes are a little dense, not quite as light and fluffy as Margot\u2019s. And the coffee . . . well, is coffee supposed to be light brown like cocoa? When Daddy comes down, he says in a merry voice, \u201cI smell coffee!\u201d And then he drinks it and gives me a thumbs-up, but I notice he only has the one sip. I guess I\u2019m a better baker than I am a cook. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou look like a farm girl,\u201d Kitty says with a touch of meanness, and I know she\u2019s still at least a little bit mad at me.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say. I\u2019m wearing faded shortalls and a scoop-neck floral shirt. It does look farm-girlish, but I think in a nice way. Margot left her brown lace-up combat boots, and they\u2019re only a half size too big. With thick socks, they\u2019re a perfect fit. \u201cWill you braid my hair to the side?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t deserve a braid from me,\u201d Kitty says, licking her fork. \u201cBesides, a braid would take it too far.\u201d</p><p>Kitty is only nine, but she has good fashion sense.</p> <p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d my dad says, not looking up from his paper.</p><p>I put my plate in the sink and then put Kitty\u2019s bag lunch down next to her plate. It\u2019s got all her favorite things: a Brie sandwich, barbecue chips, rainbow cookies, the good kind of apple juice.</p><p>\u201cHave a great first day,\u201d my dad chirps. He pops out his cheek for a kiss, and I bend down and give him one. I try to give Kitty one too, but she turns her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI got your favorite kind of apple juice and your favorite kind of Brie,\u201d I tell her pleadingly. I really don\u2019t want us to start the school year off on a bad note.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she sniffs.</p> <p>Before she can stop me, I throw my arms around her and squeeze her so tight she yelps. Then I get my new floral back-to-school book bag and head out the front door. It\u2019s a new day, a new year. I have a feeling it\u2019s going to be a good one.</p><p>Josh is already in the car, and I run over and open the door and slide inside.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on time,\u201d Josh says. He lifts his hand up for a high five, and when I slap it, our hands make a satisfying smack. \u201cThat was a good one,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cAn eight at least,\u201d I agree. We whizz past the pool, the sign for our neighborhood, then past the Wendy\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHas Kitty forgiven you yet for the other night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite, but hopefully soon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNobody can hold a grudge like Kitty,\u201d Josh says, and I nod wholeheartedly. I can never stay mad for long, but Kitty will nurse a grudge like her life depended on it.</p><p>\u201cI made her a good first-day-of-school lunch, so I think that\u2019ll help,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good big sister.\u201d</p><p>I pipe up with \u201cAs good as Margot?\u201d and together we chorus, \u201cNobody\u2019s as good as Margot.\u201d</p><p>16</p><p>SCHOOL HAS OFFICIALLY BEGUN AND found its own rhythm. The first couple of days of school are always throwaway days of handing out books and syllabuses and figuring out where you\u2019re sitting and who you\u2019re sitting with. Now is when school really begins.</p><p>For gym, Coach White set us loose outside to enjoy the warm sun while we still have it. Chris and I are walking the track field. Chris is telling me about a party she went to over Labor Day weekend. \u201cI almost got into a fight with this girl who kept saying I was wearing extensions. It\u2019s not my fault my hair is fabulous.\u201d</p><p>As we round the corner for our third lap, I catch Peter Kavinsky looking at me. I thought I was imagining it at first, him staring in my direction, but this is the third time. He\u2019s playing ultimate Frisbee with some of the guys. When we pass them, Peter jogs over to us and says, \u201cCan I talk to you for a minute?\u201d</p> <p>Chris and I look at each other. \u201cHer or me?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cLara Jean.\u201d</p><p>Chris puts her arm around my shoulder protectively. \u201cGo ahead. We\u2019re listening.\u201d</p><p>Peter rolls his eyes. \u201cI want to talk to her in private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she snaps, and she flounces away. Over her shoulder she looks back at me with wide eyes, like What? I shrug back, like I have no idea!</p><p>In a low, quiet voice, Peter says, \u201cJust so you know, I don\u2019t have any STDs.\u201d</p><p>What in the world? I stare at him, my mouth open. \u201cI never said you had an STD!\u201d</p><p>His voice is still low but actually furious. \u201cI also don\u2019t always take the last piece of pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you said. In your letter. How I\u2019m an egotistical guy who goes around giving girls STDs. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat letter? I never wrote you any letter!\u201d</p><p>Wait. Yes I did. I did write him a letter, about a million years ago. But that\u2019s not the letter he\u2019s talking about. It couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>\u201cYes. You. Did. It was addressed to me, from you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. No. No. This isn\u2019t happening. This isn\u2019t reality. I\u2019m dreaming. I\u2019m in my room and I\u2019m dreaming and Peter Kavinsky is in my dream, glaring at me. I close my eyes. Am I dreaming? Is this real?</p><p>\u201cLara Jean?\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes. I\u2019m not dreaming, and this is real. This is a nightmare. Peter Kavinsky is holding my letter in his hand. It\u2019s my handwriting, my envelope, my everything. \u201cHow\u2014how did you get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt came in the mail yesterday.\u201d Peter sighs. Gruffly he says, \u201cListen, it\u2019s no big deal; I just hope you\u2019re not going around telling people\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt came in the mail? To your house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I feel faint. I actually feel faint. Please let me faint right now, because if I faint I will no longer be here, in this moment. It will be like in movies when a girl passes out from the horror of it all and the fighting happens while she is asleep and she wakes up in a hospital bed with a bruise or two, but she\u2019s missed all the bad stuff. I wish that was my life instead of this.</p><p>I can feel myself start to sweat. Rapidly I say, \u201cYou should know that I wrote that letter a really long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, years ago. Years and years ago. I don\u2019t even remember what I said.\u201d Up close, your face wasn\u2019t so much handsome as beautiful. \u201cSeriously, that letter\u2019s from middle school. I don\u2019t even know who would have sent it. Can I see it?\u201d I reach for the letter, trying to stay calm and not sound desperate. Just casual cool.</p><p>He hesitates and then grins his perfect Peter grin. \u201cNah, I want to keep it. I never got a letter like this before.\u201d</p><p>I leap forward, and quick like a cat I snatch it out of his hand.</p><p>Peter laughs and throws up his hands in surrender. \u201cAll right, fine, have it. Geez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I start to back away from him. The paper is shaking in my hand.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He hesitates. \u201cListen, I didn\u2019t mean to steal your first kiss or whatever. I mean, that wasn\u2019t my intention\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I laugh, a forced and fake laugh that sounds crazy even to my own ears. People turn around and look at us. \u201cApology accepted! Ancient history!\u201d And then I bolt. I run faster than I\u2019ve ever run. All the way to the girls\u2019 locker room.</p><p>How did this even happen?</p><p>I sink to the floor. I\u2019ve had the going-to-school-naked dream before. I\u2019ve had the going-to-school-naked-forgot-to-study-for-an-exam-in-a-class-I-never-signed-up-for combo, the naked-exam-somebody-trying-to-kill-me combo. This is all that times infinity.</p><p>And then, because there\u2019s nothing left for me to do, I take the letter out of the envelope and I read it.</p> <p>Dear Peter K,</p><p>First of all I refuse to call you Kavinsky. You think you\u2019re so cool, going by your last name all of a sudden. Just so you know, Kavinsky sounds like the name of an old man with a long white beard.</p><p>Did you know that when you kissed me, I would come to love you? Sometimes I think yes. Definitely yes. You know why? Because you think EVERYONE loves you, Peter. That\u2019s what I hate about you. Because everyone does love you. Including me. I did. Not anymore.</p><p>Here are all your worst qualities:</p><p>You burp and you don\u2019t say excuse me. You just assume everyone else will find it charming. And if they don\u2019t, who cares, right? Wrong! You do care. You care a lot about what people think of you.</p> <p>You always take the last piece of pizza. You never ask if anyone else wants it. That\u2019s rude.</p><p>You\u2019re so good at everything. Too good. You could\u2019ve given other guys a chance to be good, but you never did.</p><p>You kissed me for no reason. Even though I knew you liked Gen, and you knew you liked Gen, and Gen knew you liked Gen. But you still did it. Just because you could. I really want to know: Why would you do that to me? My first kiss was supposed to be something special. I\u2019ve read about it, what it\u2019s supposed to feel like\u2014fireworks and lightning bolts and the sound of waves crashing in your ears. I didn\u2019t have any of that. Thanks to you it was as unspecial as a kiss could be.</p><p>The worst part of it is, that stupid nothing kiss is what made me start liking you. I never did before. I never even thought about you before. Gen has always said that you are the best-looking boy in our grade, and I agreed, because sure, you are. But I still didn\u2019t see the allure of you. Plenty of people are good-looking. That doesn\u2019t make them interesting or intriguing or cool.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s why you kissed me. To do mind control on me, to make me see you that way. It worked. Your little trick worked. From then on, I saw you. Up close, your face wasn\u2019t so much handsome as beautiful. How many beautiful boys have you ever seen? For me it was just one. You. I think it\u2019s a lot to do with your lashes. You have really long lashes. Unfairly long.</p><p>Even though you don\u2019t deserve it, fine, I\u2019ll go into all the things I like(d) about you:</p> <p>One time in science, nobody wanted to be partners with Jeffrey Suttleman because he has BO, and you volunteered like it was no big deal. Suddenly everybody thought Jeffrey wasn\u2019t so bad.</p><p>You\u2019re still in chorus, even though all the other boys take band and orchestra now. You even sing solos. And you dance, and you\u2019re not embarrassed.</p><p>You were the last boy to get tall. And now you\u2019re the tallest, but it\u2019s like you earned it. Also, when you were short, no one even cared that you were short\u2014the girls still liked you and the boys still picked you first for basketball in gym.</p><p>After you kissed me, I liked you for the rest of seventh grade and most of eighth. It hasn\u2019t been easy, watching you with Gen, holding hands and making out at the bus loop. You probably make her feel very special. Because that\u2019s your talent, right? You\u2019re good at making people feel special.</p><p>Do you know what it\u2019s like to like someone so much you can\u2019t stand it and know that they\u2019ll never feel the same way? Probably not. People like you don\u2019t have to suffer through those kinds of things. It was easier after Gen moved and we stopped being friends. At least then I didn\u2019t have to hear about it.</p><p>And now that the year is almost over, I know for sure that I am also over you. I\u2019m immune to you now, Peter. I\u2019m really proud to say that I\u2019m the only girl in this school who has been immunized to the charms of Peter Kavinsky. All because I had a really bad dose of you in seventh grade and most of eighth. Now I never ever have to worry about catching you again. What a relief! I bet if I did ever kiss you again, I would definitely catch something, and it wouldn\u2019t be love. It would be an STD!</p><p>Lara Jean Song</p><p>17</p> <p>IF I COULD CRAWL INTO a hole and burrow in it comfortably and live out the rest of my days in it, well, then that is what I would do.</p><p>Why did I have to bring up that kiss? Why?</p><p>I still remember everything about that day at John Ambrose McClaren\u2019s house. We were in the basement, and it smelled like mildew and laundry detergent. I was wearing white shorts and an embroidered blue-and-white halter top I stole out of Margot\u2019s closet. I had on a strapless bra for the first time ever. It was one of Chris\u2019s, and I kept adjusting it because it felt unnatural.</p><p>It was one of our first boy-girl hangouts on a weekend and at night. That was a weird thing too, because it felt purposeful. Not the same as going over to Allie\u2019s house after school and neighborhood boys are there hanging out with her twin brother. Also not the same as going to the arcade at the mall knowing we would probably run into boys. This was making a plan, getting dropped off, wearing a special bra, all on a Saturday night. No parents around, just us in John\u2019s ultraprivate basement. John\u2019s older brother was supposed to be watching us, but John paid him ten dollars to stay in his room.</p><p>Not that anything exciting happened, for instance an impromptu game of spin the bottle or seven minutes in heaven\u2014two possibilities for which us girls had prepared for with gum and lip gloss. All that happened was the boys played video games and us girls watched and played on our phones and whispered to each other. And then people\u2019s moms and dads were picking them up, and it was so anticlimactic after all that planning and anticipation. It was disappointing for me, not because I liked anyone, but because I liked romance and drama and I was hoping something exciting would happen to someone.</p><p>Something did.</p><p>To me!</p><p>Peter and I were downstairs alone, the last two people to be picked up. We were sitting on the couch. I kept texting my dad, Where are uuuuuu? Peter was playing a game on his phone.</p><p>And then, out of nowhere, he said, \u201cYour hair smells like coconuts.\u201d</p><p>We weren\u2019t even sitting that close. I said, \u201cReally? You can smell it from there?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He scooted closer and took a sniff, nodding. \u201cYeah, it reminds me of Hawaii or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d I said. I wasn\u2019t positive it was a compliment, but it seemed like enough of one to say thanks. \u201cI\u2019ve been switching between this coconut one and my sister\u2019s baby shampoo, to do an experiment on which makes my hair softer\u2014\u201d</p><p>Then Peter Kavinsky leaned right in and kissed me, and I was stunned.</p><p>I\u2019d never thought of him any kind of way before that kiss. He was too pretty, too smooth. Not my type of boy at all. But after he kissed me, he was all I could think about for months after.</p> <p>What if Peter is just the beginning? What if . . . what if my other letters somehow got sent too? To John Ambrose McClaren. Kenny from camp. Lucas Krapf.</p><p>Josh.</p><p>Oh my God, Josh.</p><p>I leap up off the floor. I\u2019ve got to find that hatbox. I\u2019ve got to find those letters.</p><p>I go back outside to the track. I don\u2019t see Chris anywhere, so I guess she is smoking behind the field house. I go straight over to Coach, who is sitting on the bleachers with his phone.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop throwing up,\u201d I whimper. I double over and cradle my arms to my stomach. \u201cCan I please go to the nurse\u2019s office?\u201d</p><p>Coach barely looks up from his phone. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>As soon as I\u2019m out of his eye line, I make a run for it. Gym\u2019s my last period of the day, and my house is only a couple of miles from school. I run like the wind. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever run so hard or so fast in my life, and I likely never will again. I run so hard, a couple of times I have to stop because I feel like I really am going to throw up. And then I remember the letters, and Josh, and Up close, your face wasn\u2019t so much handsome as beautiful, and I\u2019m off and running again.</p><p>As soon as I get home, I dash upstairs and go into my closet for my hatbox. It\u2019s not sitting on the top shelf where it usually sits. It\u2019s not on the floor, or behind my stack of board games. It\u2019s not anywhere. I get on my hands and knees and start rifling through piles of sweaters, shoe boxes, craft supplies. I look in places it could not possibly be, because it\u2019s a hatbox and it\u2019s big, but I look anyway. My hatbox is nowhere.</p><p>I collapse onto the floor. This is a horror movie. My life has become a horror movie. Next to me my phone buzzes. It\u2019s Josh. Where are you? Did you get a ride home with Chris?</p><p>I turn my phone off and go down to the kitchen and call Margot on the house phone. It\u2019s still my first impulse, to go to her when things get bad. I\u2019ll just leave out the Josh part of it and focus on the Peter part. She\u2019ll know what to do; she always knows what to do. I\u2019m all set to burst out, Gogo, I miss you so much and everything\u2019s a mess without you, but when she picks up the phone, she sounds sleepy, and I can tell that I\u2019ve woken her up. \u201cWere you sleeping?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I was just lying down,\u201d she lies.</p><p>\u201cYes you were sleeping! Gogo, it\u2019s not even ten o\u2019clock over there! Wait, is it? Did I calculate wrong again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re right. I\u2019m just so tired. I\u2019ve been up since five, because . . .\u201d Her voice trails off. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I hesitate. Maybe it\u2019s better not to burden Margot with all of this. I mean, she just got to college: this is what she\u2019s worked for; this is her dream come true. She should be having fun and not worrying over how things are going back home without her. Besides, what would I even say? I wrote a bunch of love letters and they got sent out, including one I wrote to your boyfriend? \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong,\u201d I say. I\u2019m doing what Margot would do, which is figure it out on my own.</p><p>\u201cIt definitely sounds like something\u2019s wrong.\u201d Margot yawns. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo back to sleep, Gogo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she says, yawning again.</p><p>We hang up and I make myself an ice cream sundae right in the carton: chocolate sauce, whipped cream, chopped nuts. The works. I take it back up to my room and eat it lying down. I feed it to myself like medicine, until I\u2019ve eaten the whole thing, every last bite.</p> <p>18</p><p>A LITTLE WHILE LATER I wake up to kitty standing at the foot of my bed. \u201cYou\u2019ve got ice cream on your sheets,\u201d she informs me.</p><p>I groan and turn over to my side. \u201cKitty, that\u2019s the least of my problems today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy wants to know if you want chicken for dinner or hamburgers. My vote is chicken.\u201d</p><p>I sit straight up. Daddy\u2019s home! Maybe he knows something. He was on that cleaning binge, throwing things away. Maybe he\u2019s spirited my hatbox away somewhere safe, and the Peter letter was just an unfortunate fluke!</p><p>I jump out of bed and run downstairs, my heart thumping hard in my chest. My dad\u2019s in his study, wearing his glasses and reading a thick book on Audubon paintings.</p><p>All in one breath I ask, \u201cDaddy-have-you-seen-my-hatbox?\u201d</p><p>He looks up; his face is hazy and I can tell he is still with Audubon\u2019s birds and not at all focused on my frenzied state. \u201cWhat box?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy teal hatbox Mommy gave me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that . . . ,\u201d he says, still looking confused. He takes off his glasses. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It might have gone the way of your roller skates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean? What are you even saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodwill. There\u2019s a slight possibility I took them to Goodwill.\u201d</p><p>When I gasp, my dad says defensively, \u201cThose roller skates don\u2019t even fit you anymore. They were just taking up space!\u201d</p><p>I sink to the floor. \u201cThey were pink and they were vintage and I was saving them for Kitty . . . and that\u2019s not even the point. I don\u2019t care about the roller skates. I care about my hatbox! Daddy, you don\u2019t even know what you\u2019ve done.\u201d My dad gets up and tries to pull me off the floor. I resist him and flop onto my back like a goldfish.</p><p>\u201cLara Jean, I don\u2019t even know that I got rid of it. Come on, let\u2019s have a look around the house, all right? Don\u2019t let\u2019s panic yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one place it could be, and it\u2019s not there. It\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll check Goodwill tomorrow on my way to work,\u201d he says, squatting down next to me. He\u2019s giving me that look\u2014sympathetic but also exasperated and mystified, like How is it possible that my sane and reasonable DNA created such a crazy daughter?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late. It\u2019s too late. There\u2019s no point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was in that box that\u2019s so important?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I can feel my ice cream sundae curdling in my stomach. For the second time today I feel like I\u2019m going to be sick. \u201cOnly everything.\u201d</p><p>He grimaces. \u201cI really didn\u2019t realize your mother had given it to you or that it was so important.\u201d As he retreats off to the kitchen, he says, \u201cHey, how about an ice cream sundae before dinner? Will that cheer you up?\u201d</p><p>As if dessert before dinner would be the thing that cheers me up, as if I am Kitty\u2019s age and not sixteen going on seventeen. I don\u2019t even bother dignifying it with an answer. I just lie there on the floor, my cheek against the cool hardwood. Besides, there isn\u2019t any ice cream left anyway, but he\u2019ll find that out soon enough.</p><p>I don\u2019t even want to think about Josh reading that letter. I don\u2019t even want to think it. It\u2019s too terrible.</p> <p>After dinner (chicken, per Kitty\u2019s request), I\u2019m in the kitchen doing dishes when I hear the doorbell ring. Daddy opens the door, and I hear Josh\u2019s voice. \u201cHey, Dr. Covey. Is Lara Jean around?\u201d</p><p>Oh, no. No no no no. I can\u2019t see Josh. I know I have to at some point, but not today. Not right this second. I can\u2019t. I just can\u2019t.</p><p>I drop the plate back into the sink and make a run for it, out the back door, down the porch steps, across the backyard to the Pearces\u2019 yard. I scramble up the wooden ladder and into Carolyn Pearce\u2019s old tree house. I haven\u2019t been in this tree house since middle school. We used to hang out up here sometimes, at night\u2014Chris and Genevieve and Allie and me, the boys a couple of times.</p><p>I peek through the wooden slats, crouched in a ball, waiting until I see Josh walk back to his house. When I\u2019m sure he\u2019s inside, I climb down the ladder and run back to mine. I sure have been doing a lot of running today. I\u2019m exhausted, now that I think of it.</p><p>19</p> <p>I WAKE UP THE NEXT morning renewed. I am a girl with a plan. I\u2019m just going to have to avoid Josh forever. It\u2019s as simple as that. And if not forever, then at least until this dies down and he forgets about my letter. There\u2019s still the tiny chance he never even got it. Perhaps whoever mailed Peter\u2019s only sent the one! You never know.</p><p>My mom always said optimism was my best trait. Both Chris and Margot have said it\u2019s annoying, but to that I say looking on the bright side of life never killed anybody.</p><p>When I get downstairs, Daddy and Kitty are already at the table eating toast. I make myself a bowl of cereal and sit down with them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to stop by Goodwill on my way to work,\u201d my dad says, crunching on his toast from behind his newspaper. \u201cI\u2019m sure the hatbox will turn up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hatbox is missing?\u201d Kitty asks me. \u201cThe one Mommy gave you?\u201d</p><p>I nod and shovel cereal into my mouth. I have to leave soon or else I\u2019ll risk running into Josh on my way out.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was in the box, anyway?\u201d Kitty asks.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s private,\u201d I say. \u201cAll you need to know is the contents are precious to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be mad at Daddy if you never get the hatbox back?\u201d Kitty answers her own question before I can. \u201cI doubt it. You never stay mad for long.\u201d</p><p>This is true. I never can stay mad for long.</p><p>Peering over his newspaper, he asks Kitty, \u201cWhat in the world was in that hatbox?\u201d</p><p>Kitty shrugs. Her mouth full of toast, she says, \u201cProbably more French berets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not more berets.\u201d I give them both a mean look. \u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, I don\u2019t want to be late for school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you leaving a little early?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m taking the bus today,\u201d I say. And probably every day until Margot\u2019s car is fixed, but they don\u2019t need to know that.</p><p>20</p><p>THE WAY IT HAPPENS IS a strange sort of serendipity. A slow-motion train wreck. For something to go this colossally wrong, everything must intersect and collide at the exact right, or in this case, wrong, moment.</p><p>If the bus driver hadn\u2019t had trouble backing out of the cul-de-sac, taking four extra minutes to get to school, I never would have run into Josh.</p><p>If Josh\u2019s car had started up and he hadn\u2019t had to get a jump from his dad, he wouldn\u2019t have been walking by my locker.</p><p>And if Peter hadn\u2019t had to meet Ms. Wooten in the guidance office, he would not have been walking down the hallway ten seconds later. And maybe this whole thing would not have happened. But it did.</p><p>I\u2019m at my locker; the door is jammed, and I\u2019m trying to yank it open. I finally get the door loose and there\u2019s Josh, standing right there.</p><p>\u201cLara Jean . . .\u201d He has this shell-shocked, confused expression on his face. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to talk to you since last night. I came by, and nobody could find you. . . .\u201d He holds out my letter. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. What is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know . . . ,\u201d I hear myself say. My voice feels far away. It\u2019s like I\u2019m floating above myself, watching it all unfold.</p><p>\u201cI mean, it\u2019s from you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, wow.\u201d I take a breath and accept the letter. I fight the urge to tear it up. \u201cWhere did you even get this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt got sent to me in the mail.\u201d Josh jams his hands into his pockets. \u201cWhen did you write this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, a long time ago,\u201d I say. I let out a fake little laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t even remember when. It might have been middle school.\u201d Good job, Lara Jean. Keep it up.</p><p>Slowly he says, \u201cRight . . . but you mention going to the movies with Margot and Mike and Ben that time. That was a couple of years ago.\u201d</p><p>I bite my bottom lip. \u201cRight. I mean, it was kind of a long time ago. In the grand scheme of things.\u201d I can feel tears coming on so close that if I break concentration even for a second, if I waver, I will cry and that will make everything worse, if such a thing is possible. I must be cool and breezy and nonchalant now. Tears would ruin that.</p><p>Josh is staring at me so hard I have to look away. \u201cSo then . . . Do you . . . or did you have feelings for me or . . .??\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, yes, sure, I did have a crush on you at one point, before you and Margot ever started dating. A million years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever say anything? Because, Lara Jean . . . God. I don\u2019t know.\u201d His eyes are on me, and they\u2019re confused, but there\u2019s something else, too. \u201cThis is crazy. I feel kind of blindsided.\u201d</p><p>The way he\u2019s looking at me now, I\u2019m suddenly in a time warp back to a summer day when I was fourteen and he was fifteen, and we were walking home from somewhere. He was looking at me so intently I was sure he was going to try to kiss me. I got nervous, so I picked a fight with him and he never looked at me like that again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Until this moment.</p><p>Don\u2019t.

I\u2019m dating someone, someone I really really like, so please don\u2019t worry about this.\u201d I wave the letter like it\u2019s just paper, trash, like once upon a time I didn\u2019t literally pour my heart onto this page. I stuff it into my bag. \u201cI was really confused when I wrote this; I don\u2019t even know how it got sent out. Honestly, it\u2019s not worth talking about. So please, please don\u2019t say anything to Margot about it.\u201d</p><p>He nods, but that\u2019s not good enough. I need a verbal commitment. I need to hear the words come out of his mouth. So I add, \u201cDo you swear? On your life?\u201d If Margot was to ever find out . . . I would want to die.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I swear. I mean, we haven\u2019t even spoken since she left.\u201d</p> <p>I let out a huge breath. \u201cGreat. Thanks.\u201d I\u2019m about to walk away, but then Josh stops me.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy you\u2019re dating.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when I see him. Peter Kavinsky, walking down the hallway. Like magic. Beautiful, dark-haired Peter. He deserves background music, he looks so good. \u201cPeter. Kavinsky. Peter Kavinsky!\u201d The bell rings, and I sail past Josh. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go! Talk later, Josh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d he calls out.</p> <p>I run up to Peter and launch myself into his arms like a shot out of a cannon. I\u2019ve got my arms around his neck and my legs hooked around his waist, and I don\u2019t even know how my body knows how, because I\u2019ve for sure never touched a boy like this in my life. It\u2019s like we\u2019re in a movie and the music is swelling and waves are crashing around us. Except for the fact that Peter\u2019s expression is registering pure shock and disbelief and maybe a drop of amusement, because Peter likes to be amused. Raising his eyebrows, he says, \u201cLara Jean? What the\u2014?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer. I just kiss him.</p><p>My first thought is: I have muscle memory of his lips.</p><p>My second thought is: I hope Josh is watching. He has to be watching or it\u2019s all for nothing.</p><p>My heart is beating so fast I forget to be afraid of doing it wrong. Because for about three seconds, he\u2019s kissing me back. Peter Kavinsky, the boy of every girl\u2019s dreams, is kissing me back.</p><p>I haven\u2019t kissed that many boys before. Peter Kavinsky, John Ambrose McClaren, Allie Feldman\u2019s cousin with the weird eye, and now Peter again.</p><p>I open my eyes and Peter\u2019s staring at me with that same expression on his face. Very sincerely I say, \u201cThank you.\u201d He replies, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d and I hop out of his arms and sprint off in the opposite direction.</p><p>It takes all of history class and most of English for my heart rate to slow down. I kissed Peter Kavinsky. In the hallway, in front of everybody. In front of Josh.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t think this thing through, obviously. That\u2019s what Margot would say, including and especially the \u201cobviously.\u201d If I had thought it through, I would have made up a boyfriend and not picked an actual person. More specifically, I would not have picked Peter K. He is literally the worst person I could have picked, because everybody knows him. He\u2019s Peter Kavinsky, for Pete\u2019s sake. Kavinsky of Gen and Kavinsky. It doesn\u2019t matter that they\u2019re broken up. They\u2019re an institution at this institution.</p><p>I spend the rest of the day hiding out. I even eat my lunch in the girls\u2019 bathroom.</p><p>My last class of the day is gym. With Peter. Coach White gives us a reintroduction to the weight room, and we have to practice using the machines. Peter and his friends already know how to use them, so they separate off from the group and have a free-throw contest, and I don\u2019t get a chance to talk to him. At one point he catches me looking at him and he winks, which makes me want to shrivel up and die.</p><p>After class is over, I wait for Peter outside the boys\u2019 locker room, planning out what I\u2019m going to say, how I\u2019m going to explain it. I\u2019ll start out with, \u201cSo about this morning . . . ,\u201d and then I\u2019ll give a little laugh, like how hilarious was that!</p><p>Peter\u2019s the last one to come out. His hair is wet from a shower. It\u2019s weird that boys take showers at school, since girls never do. I wonder if they have stalls in there, or just a bunch of shower heads and no privacy.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says when he sees me, but he doesn\u2019t stop.</p><p>To his back I hurriedly say, \u201cSo about this morning . . .\u201d I laugh, and Peter turns around and just looks at me.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. What was that all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a dumb joke,\u201d I begin.</p><p>Peter crosses his arms and leans against the lockers. \u201cDid it have anything to do with that letter you sent me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, yes. Tangentially.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he says kindly. \u201cI think you\u2019re cute. In a quirky way. But Gen and I just broke up, and I\u2019m not in a place right now where I want be somebody\u2019s boyfriend. So . . .\u201d</p><p>My mouth drops. Peter Kavinsky is giving me the brush-off! I don\u2019t even like him, and he\u2019s giving me the brush-off. Also, \u201cquirky\u201d? How am I \u201cquirky\u201d? \u201cCute in a quirky way\u201d is an insult. A total insult!</p><p>He\u2019s still talking, still giving me the kind eyes. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m definitely flattered. That you would like me all this time\u2014it\u2019s flattering, you know?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s enough. That\u2019s plenty enough. \u201cI don\u2019t like you,\u201d I say, loudly. \u201cSo there\u2019s no reason you should feel flattered.\u201d</p><p>Now it\u2019s Peter\u2019s turn to look taken aback. He quickly looks around to see if anyone heard. He leans forward and whispers, \u201cThen why did you kiss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kissed you because I don\u2019t like you,\u201d I explain, like this should be obvious. \u201cSee, my letters got sent out by someone. Not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute. \u2018Letters\u2019? How many of us are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive. And the guy I do like got one too\u2014\u201d</p><p>Peter frowns. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Why should I tell him anything? \u201cThat\u2019s . . . personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I think I have a right to know, since you pulled me into this little drama,\u201d Peter says with a pointed look. I suck in my top lip and shake my head and he adds, \u201cIf there even really is a guy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere is so a guy! It\u2019s Josh Sanderson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t he go out with your sister?\u201d</p><p>I nod. I\u2019m surprised he even knows this. I didn\u2019t think Josh and Margot would be on his radar. \u201cThey\u2019re broken up now. But I don\u2019t want him to know I have feelings for him . . . for obvious reasons. So . . . I told him you were my boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you used me to save face?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI mean, basically.\u201d Basically exactly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a funny girl.\u201d</p><p>First I\u2019m cute in a quirky way; now I\u2019m a funny girl. I know what that means. \u201cAnyway, thanks for going along with it, Peter.\u201d I flash him what I hope is a winning smile and turn on my heel to go. \u201cSee ya!\u201d</p><p>Peter reaches out and grabs me by the backpack. \u201cWait\u2014so Sanderson thinks I\u2019m your boyfriend now, right? So what are you going to tell him?\u201d</p><p>I try to shrug him loose, but he won\u2019t let go. \u201cI haven\u2019t figured that part out yet. But I will.\u201d I lift my chin. \u201cI\u2019m quirky like that.\u201d</p> <p>Peter laughs out loud, his mouth open wide. \u201cYou really are funny, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>21</p><p>MY PHONE VIBRATES NEXT TO me. It\u2019s chris.</p><p>\u201cIs it true?\u201d I can hear her puffing on her cigarette.</p><p>\u201cIs what true?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m lying on my bed, on my stomach. My mom told me that if my stomach hurt, I should lie on my stomach and it would warm up and feel better. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helping, though. My stomach\u2019s been in knots all day.</p> <p>\u201cDid you run up to Kavinsky and kiss him like a maniac?\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and whimper. I wish I could say no, because I\u2019m not the kind of person to do that. But I did do it, so I guess I am. But my reasons were really good! I want to tell Chris the truth, but the whole thing is just so embarrassing. \u201cYeah. I went up to Peter Kavinsky and kissed him. Like a maniac.\u201d</p><p>Chris exhales. \u201cDamn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly? I don\u2019t even know. I just . . . did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. I didn\u2019t know you had it in you. I\u2019m kind of impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you know Gen\u2019s gonna come after you, right? They may be broken up, but she still thinks she owns his ass.\u201d</p><p>My stomach lurches. \u201cYeah. I know. I\u2019m scared, Chris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best to protect you from her, but you know how she is. You better watch your back.\u201d Chris hangs up.</p><p>I feel even worse than before. If Margot was here, she\u2019d probably say that writing those letters was pointless in the first place, and she\u2019d get on me about telling such a big lie. Then she\u2019d help me figure out a solution. But Margot\u2019s not here, she\u2019s in Scotland\u2014and even bigger than that, she\u2019s the one person I can\u2019t talk to. She can never-never-never know how I felt about Josh.</p><p>After a while I get out of bed and wander into Kitty\u2019s room. She\u2019s on the floor rifling through her bottom drawer. Without looking up, she says, \u201cHave you seen my pajamas with the hearts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI washed them yesterday, so they\u2019re probably in the dryer. Tonight do you wanna watch a movie and play Uno?\u201d I could use a cheer-up night.</p><p>Kitty scrambles up. \u201cCan\u2019t. I\u2019m going to Alicia Bernard\u2019s birthday. It\u2019s in the schedule notebook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Alicia Bernard?\u201d I plop down on Kitty\u2019s unmade bed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the new girl. She invited all the girls in our class. Her mom\u2019s making us crepes for breakfast. Do you know what a crepe is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever had one? I heard they can be salty or sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I had one with Nutella and strawberries once.\u201d Josh and Margot and I drove down to Richmond because Margot wanted to go to the Edgar Allan Poe museum. We ate lunch at a caf\u00e9 downtown and that\u2019s what I had.</p><p>Kitty\u2019s eyes go big and greedy. \u201cI hope that\u2019s the kind her mom makes.\u201d Then she dashes off, I guess to find her pajamas in the laundry room downstairs.</p><p>I pick up Kitty\u2019s stuffed pig and cuddle it in my arms. So even my nine-year-old sister has plans on a Friday night. If Margot was here, we\u2019d be going to the movies with Josh, or stopping by the cocktail hour at the Belleview retirement home. If my dad was home, I could maybe get up the courage to take his car or have him drop me off, but I can\u2019t even do that.</p><p>After Kitty gets picked up, I go back to my room and organize my shoe collection. It\u2019s a little early in the season to switch out my sandals for my winter shoes, but I go ahead and do it because I\u2019m in the mood. I think about doing my clothes too, but that\u2019s no small undertaking. Instead I sit down and write Margot a letter on stationery my grandma bought me in Korea. It\u2019s pale blue with a border of fluffy white lambs. I talk about school, and Kitty\u2019s new teacher, and a lavender skirt I ordered from a Japanese website that I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll want to borrow, but I don\u2019t tell her any of the real things.</p><p>I miss her so much. Nothing\u2019s the same without her. I\u2019m realizing now that the year is going to be a lonely one, because I don\u2019t have Margot, and I don\u2019t have Josh, and it\u2019s just me alone. I have Chris, but not really. I wish I\u2019d made more friends. If I had more friends, maybe I wouldn\u2019t have done something as stupid as kiss Peter K. in the hallway and tell Josh he\u2019s my boyfriend.</p><p>22</p><p>I WAKE UP TO THE sound of the lawn mower.</p><p>It\u2019s Saturday morning and I can\u2019t fall back to sleep, so now I\u2019m lying in my bed staring at my walls, at all the pictures and things I\u2019ve saved. I\u2019m thinking I want to shake things up. I\u2019m thinking maybe I should paint my room. The only question is, what color? Lavender? Cotton-candy pink? Something bold, like turquoise? Maybe just an accent wall? Maybe one marigold wall, one salmon pink. It\u2019s a lot to consider. I should probably wait for Margot to come home before I make such a momentous decision. Plus I\u2019ve never painted a room before, and Margot has, with Habitat for Humanity. She\u2019ll know what to do.</p><p>On Saturdays we usually have something good for breakfast, like pancakes or frittata with frozen shredded potato and broccoli. But since there\u2019s no Kitty and no Margot, I just eat cereal instead. Who ever heard of making pancakes or frittata for just one person? My dad\u2019s been awake for hours; he\u2019s outside mowing the lawn. I don\u2019t want to get roped into helping him do yard work, so I make myself busy in the house and clean the downstairs. I Swiffer and DustBust and wipe the tables down, and all the while my wheels are turning about how I\u2019m going to get myself out of this Peter K. situation with even a sliver of dignity. The wheels turn and turn, but no good solutions come to mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Kitty gets dropped off, I\u2019m folding laundry.

I just stayed home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI organized my closet.\u201d It\u2019s humiliating to say that out loud. Hastily I change the subject. \u201cSo did Alicia\u2019s mom make sweet crepes or salty ones?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe made both. First we had ham and cheese and then we had Nutella. How come we never have any Nutella?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think maybe because hazelnuts make Margot\u2019s throat itch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we get some next time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to eat the whole jar before Margot comes home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Kitty says.</p> <p>\u201cOn a scale of one to ten, how badly do you miss Gogo?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>Kitty thinks this over. \u201cA six point five,\u201d she says at last.</p><p>\u201cOnly a six point five?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been really busy,\u201d she says, rolling over and kicking her legs up in the air. \u201cI\u2019ve hardly had time to miss Margot. You know, if you got out more, maybe you wouldn\u2019t miss her so much.\u201d</p><p>I boomerang a sock at her head and Kitty explodes into a giggle fit. I\u2019m tickling her armpits when Daddy comes in from outside with a stack of mail. \u201cSomething came back return to sender for you, Lara Jean,\u201d he says, handing me an envelope.</p><p>It\u2019s got my handwriting! I scramble up and snatch it out of his hands. It\u2019s my letter to Kenny from camp. It came back to me!</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s Kenny?\u201d Daddy wants to know.</p><p>\u201cJust a boy I met at church camp a long time ago,\u201d I say, tearing the envelope open.</p><p>Dear Kenny,</p><p>It\u2019s the last day of camp and possibly the last time I will ever see you because we live so far apart. Remember on the second day, I was scared to do archery and you made a joke about minnows and it was so funny I nearly peed my pants?</p><p>I stop reading. A joke about minnows? How funny could it have been?</p><p>I was really homesick but you made me feel better. I think I might\u2019ve left camp early if it hadn\u2019t been for you, Kenny. So, thank you. Also you\u2019re a really amazing swimmer and I like your laugh. I wish it had been me you kissed at the bonfire last night and not Blaire H.</p><p>Take care, Kenny. Have a really good rest of the summer and a really good life.</p><p>Love, Lara Jean</p> <p>I clutch the letter to my chest.</p><p>This is the first love letter I ever wrote. I\u2019m glad it came back to me. Though, I suppose it wouldn\u2019t have been so bad if Kenny Donati got to know that he helped two people at camp that summer\u2014the kid who almost drowned in the lake and twelve-year-old Lara Jean Song Covey.</p><p>23</p><p>WHEN MY DAD HAS A day off, he cooks Korean food. It\u2019s not exactly authentic, and sometimes he just goes to the Korean market and buys ready-made side dishes and marinated meat, but sometimes he\u2019ll call our grandma for a recipe and he\u2019ll try. That\u2019s the thing: Daddy tries. He doesn\u2019t say so, but I know it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t want us to lose our connection to our Korean side, and food is the only way he knows how to contribute. After Mommy died, he used to try to make us have play dates with other Korean kids, but it always felt awkward and forced. Except I did have a crush on Edward Kim for a minute there. Thank God the crush never escalated into full-on love\u2014or else I\u2019d have written him a letter too, and that\u2019d be just one more person I\u2019d have to avoid.</p><p>My dad\u2019s made bo ssam, which is pork shoulder you slice up and then wrap in lettuce. He brined it last night in sugar and salt and it\u2019s been roasting in the oven all day. Kitty and I keep checking on it; it smells so good.</p><p>When it\u2019s finally time to eat, my dad has everything laid out on the dining room table so pretty. A silver bowl of butter-lettuce leaves, just washed, with the water beads still clinging to the surface; a cut-glass bowl of kimchi he bought from Whole Foods; a little bowl of pepper paste; soy sauce with scallions and ginger.</p><p>My dad\u2019s taking arty pictures of the table. \u201cI\u2019m sending a pic to Margot so she can see,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it over there?\u201d I ask him. It\u2019s a cozy day: it\u2019s nearly six o\u2019clock, and I\u2019m still in my pj\u2019s. I\u2019m hugging my knees to me, sitting in the big dining-room chair with the armrests.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s eleven. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s still up,\u201d my dad says, snapping away. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you invite Josh over? We\u2019re going to need help finishing all this food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably busy,\u201d I say quickly. I still haven\u2019t figured out what I\u2019m going to say to him about me and Peter, much less me and him.</p><p>\u201cJust try him. He loves Korean food.\u201d Daddy moves the pork shoulder so it\u2019s more centered. \u201cHurry, before my bo ssam gets cold!\u201d</p><p>I pretend to text him on my phone. I feel a tiny bit guilty for lying, but Daddy would understand if he knew all the facts.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you kids text when you could just call. You\u2019d get an answer right away instead of waiting for one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so old, Daddy,\u201d I say. I look down at my phone. \u201cJosh can\u2019t come over. Let\u2019s just eat. Kitty! Dinner bell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCo-ming!\u201d Kitty screams from upstairs.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe he\u2019ll come over later and take some leftovers,\u201d Daddy says.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, Josh has his own life now. Why would he come over when Margot\u2019s not here? Besides, they\u2019re not even together anymore, remember?\u201d</p><p>My dad makes a confused face. \u201cWhat? They\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>I guess Margot didn\u2019t tell him after all. Though you\u2019d have thought he could have sussed it out for himself when Josh didn\u2019t come with us to the airport to drop Margot off. Why don\u2019t dads know anything? Does he not have eyes and ears? \u201cNo, they\u2019re not. And by the way, Margot is at college in Scotland. And my name is Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right, your dad is clueless,\u201d Daddy says. \u201cI get it. No need to rub it in.\u201d He scratches his chin. \u201cGeez, I could have sworn Margot never mentioned anything. . . .\u201d</p><p>Kitty comes crashing into the dining room. \u201cYum yum yum.\u201d She slams into her chair and starts spearing pork onto her plate.</p><p>\u201cKitty, we have to pray first,\u201d my dad says, settling into his chair.</p><p>We only ever pray before we eat when we eat in the dining room, and we only ever eat in the dining room when Daddy cooks Korean or on Thanksgiving or Christmas. Mommy used to take us to church when we were little, and after she died, Daddy tried to keep it going, but he has Sunday shifts sometimes and it became less and less. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you, God, for this food you have blessed us with. Thank you for my beautiful daughters, and please watch over our Margot. In Jesus\u2019s name we pray, amen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d we echo.</p><p>\u201cLooks pretty great, right, girls?\u201d My dad is grinning as he assembles a lettuce leaf with pork and rice and kimchi. \u201cKitty, you know how to do it, right? It\u2019s like a little taco.\u201d</p><p>Kitty nods and copies him.</p> <p>I make my own lettuce-leaf taco and nearly spit it out. The pork is really really salty. So salty I could cry. But I keep chewing, and across the table Kitty\u2019s making a horrible face at me, but I give her a shush look. Daddy hasn\u2019t tried his yet; he\u2019s taking a picture of his plate.</p><p>\u201cSo good, Daddy,\u201d I say. \u201cIt tastes like at the restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Lara Jean. It came out just like the picture. I can\u2019t believe how beautiful and crispy the top looks.\u201d My dad finally takes a bite, and then he frowns. \u201cIs this salty to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I say.</p><p>He takes another bite. \u201cThis tastes really salty to me. Kitty, what do you think?\u201d</p> <p>Kitty\u2019s chugging water. \u201cNo, it tastes good, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>I give her a secret thumbs-up.</p><p>\u201cHmm, no, it definitely tastes salty.\u201d He swallows. \u201cI followed the recipe exactly . . . maybe I used the wrong kind of salt for the brine? Lara Jean, taste it again.\u201d</p><p>I take a teeny-tiny bite, which I try to hide by putting the lettuce in front of my face. \u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe if I cut more from the center . . .\u201d</p><p>My phone buzzes on the table. It\u2019s a text from Josh. Was coming back from a run and saw the light on in the dining room. A totally normal text, as if yesterday never happened.</p> <p>Korean food??</p><p>Josh has some sixth sense of when my dad\u2019s cooking Korean food, because he\u2019ll come sniffing around right when we\u2019re sitting down to eat. He loves Korean food. When my grandma comes to visit, he won\u2019t leave her side. He\u2019ll even watch Korean dramas with her. She cuts him pieces of apple and peels clementines for him like he\u2019s a baby. My grandma likes boys better than girls.</p><p>Now that I think of it, all the women in my family really do love Josh. Except for Mommy, who never got to meet him. But I\u2019m sure she\u2019d love him too. She\u2019d love anyone who\u2019s as good to Margot as Josh is, was, to her.</p><p>Kitty cranes her neck to look over my shoulder. \u201cIs that Josh? Is he coming over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I set down my phone and it buzzes again. Can I come over?</p><p>\u201cIt says he wants to come over!\u201d</p><p>My dad perks up. \u201cTell him to come over! I want to get his opinion on this bo ssam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, everyone in this family needs to accept that Josh is no longer a part of it. He and Margot are donzo\u2014\u201d I hesitate. Does Kitty still not know? I can\u2019t remember if it\u2019s still supposed to be a secret. \u201cI mean now that Margot\u2019s at college and they\u2019re long distance . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know they\u2019re broken up,\u201d Kitty says, making a lettuce wrap with just rice. \u201cMargot told me over video chat.\u201d</p><p>Across the table my dad makes a sad face and stuffs a piece of lettuce in his mouth.</p><p>Her mouth full, Kitty continues, \u201cI just don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t still be friends with him. He\u2019s all of our friend. Right, Daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d my dad agrees. \u201cAnd look, relationships are incredibly amorphous. They could get back together. They could stay friends. Who\u2019s to say what will happen in the future? I say we don\u2019t count Josh out just yet.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re finishing up dinner when I get another text from Josh. Never mind, it says.</p><p>We are stuck eating that salty pork shoulder for the rest of the weekend. The next morning, my dad makes fried rice and cuts the pork into tiny pieces and says to \u201cthink of it like bacon.\u201d For dinner I test that theory by mixing it with Kraft macaroni and cheese, and I end up throwing out the whole batch because it tastes like slop. \u201cIf we had a dog . . . ,\u201d Kitty keeps saying. I make a batch of regular macaroni instead.</p><p>After dinner I take Sadie the Sweetheart for a walk. That\u2019s what my sisters and I call Sadie; she\u2019s a golden retriever that lives down the street. The Shahs are out of town for the night, so they asked me to feed her and walk her. Normally, Kitty would beg to be the one to do it, but there\u2019s some movie on TV that she\u2019s been waiting to see.</p><p>Sadie and I are doing the usual route around our cul-de-sac when Josh jogs up to us in his running clothes. Crouching down to pet Sadie, he says, \u201cSo how are things going with Kavinsky?\u201d</p><p>Funny you should bring that up, Josh. \u2019Cause I\u2019ve got my story locked and loaded. Peter and I had a fight via video chat this morning (in case Josh has noticed I haven\u2019t left the house all weekend), and we broke up, and I\u2019m devastated about the whole thing, because I\u2019ve been in constant love with Peter Kavinsky since the seventh grade, but c\u2019est la vie.</p><p>\u201cActually, Peter and I broke up this morning.\u201d I bite my lip and try to look sad. \u201cIt\u2019s just, really hard, you know? After I liked him for so long and then finally he likes me back. But it\u2019s just not meant to be. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s over his breakup yet. I think maybe Genevieve still has too strong a hold on him, so there\u2019s no room in his heart for me.\u201d</p><p>Josh gives me a funny look. \u201cThat\u2019s not what he was saying today at McCalls.\u201d</p><p>What in the world was Peter K. doing at a bookstore? He\u2019s not the bookstore type. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d I try to sound casual, but my heart is pounding so loudly I\u2019m pretty sure Sadie can hear it.</p><p>Josh keeps petting Sadie.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Now I\u2019m just trying not to sound shrill. \u201cLike, what was said exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was ringing him up, I asked him when you guys started going out, and he said recently. He said he really liked you.\u201d</p><p>What . . .</p><p>I must look as shocked as I feel, because Josh straightens up and says, \u201cYeah, I was kind of surprised too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were surprised that he would like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, kind of. Kavinsky just isn\u2019t the kind of guy who would date a girl like you.\u201d When I stare back at him, sour and unsmiling, he quickly tries to backtrack. \u201cI mean, because you\u2019re not, you know . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not what? As pretty as Genevieve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! That\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying. What I\u2019m trying to say is, you\u2019re like this sweet, innocent girl who likes to be at home with her family, and I don\u2019t know, I guess Kavinsky doesn\u2019t strike me as someone who would be into that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before he can say another word, I grab my phone out of my jacket pocket and say, \u201cThat\u2019s Peter calling me right now, so I guess he does like homely girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say homely! I said you like to be at home!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, Josh.\u201d I speed walk away, dragging Sadie with me. Into my phone I say, \u201cOh hey, Peter.\u201d</p><p>24</p> <p>IN CHEM, PETER SITS A row in front of me.</p><p>I write him a note. Why would you tell Josh that we\u2019re\u2014 I hesitate and then finish with a thing?</p><p>I kick the back of his chair, and he turns around and I hand him the note. He slouches in his seat to read it; then I watch as he scribbles something. He tips back in his chair and drops the note on my desk without looking at me.</p><p>A thing? Haha.</p><p>I press down so hard my pencil tip chips off. Please answer the question.</p> <p>We\u2019ll talk later.</p><p>I let out a frustrated sigh and Matt, my lab partner, gives me a funny look.</p><p>After class Peter is swept away with all his friends; they leave in a big group. I\u2019m packing up my backpack when he returns, alone. He hops up on the table. \u201cSo let\u2019s talk,\u201d he says, super casual.</p><p>I clear my throat and try to gather my bearings. \u201cWhy did you tell Josh we were\u2014\u201d I almost say \u201ca thing\u201d again, but then change it to \u201ctogether?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get what you\u2019re so upset about. I did you a favor. I could have just as easily blown up your spot.\u201d</p><p>I pause. He\u2019s right. He could have. \u201cSo why didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve sure got a funny way of saying thank you. You\u2019re welcome, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Automatically I say, \u201cThank you.\u201d Wait. Why am I thanking him? \u201cI appreciate you letting me kiss you, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he says again.</p><p>Ugh! He\u2019s so insufferable. Just for that I\u2019m going to toss a little dig his way. \u201cThat was . . . really generous of you. To let me do that. But I\u2019ve already explained to Josh that it\u2019s not going to work out with us because Genevieve has you whipped, so it\u2019s all good. You can stop pretending now.\u201d</p><p>Peter glares at me. \u201cI\u2019m not whipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut aren\u2019t you, though? I mean, you guys have been together since the seventh grade. You\u2019re basically her property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Peter scoffs.</p><p>\u201cThere was a rumor last year that she made you get a tattoo of her initials on your butt for her birthday.\u201d I pause. \u201cSo did you?\u201d I reach around him and fake try to lift up the back of his shirt. He yelps and jumps away from me, and I collapse in a fit of giggles. \u201cSo you do have a tattoo!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a tattoo!\u201d he yells. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not even together anymore, so can you stop with this shit? We broke up. We\u2019re over. I\u2019m done with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, didn\u2019t she break up with you?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Peter shoots me a dirty look. \u201cIt was mutual.\u201d</p><p>Hastily I say, \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get back together soon. You\u2019ve broken up before, right? Only to get back together again, like immediately. It\u2019s probably because you were each other\u2019s firsts. That\u2019s why you can\u2019t let each other go. I\u2019ve heard that\u2019s how it is with firsts, especially with guys.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s mouth drops. \u201cHow do you know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, everybody knows. You guys did it freshman year in her parents\u2019 basement, right?\u201d</p><p>He gives a grudging nod.</p><p>\u201cSee? Even I know, and I\u2019m a nobody. Even if you do stay broken up for real this time, which I doubt, it\u2019s not like any other girl can date you.\u201d Meaningfully I say, \u201cLet\u2019s not forget what happened to Jamila Singh.\u201d</p><p>Peter and Genevieve broke up for a month last year, so Peter started dating Jamila Singh. Jamila might even be prettier than Genevieve\u2014a different kind of pretty, anyway. More like hot. She has long wavy black hair and a little waist and a big butt. Let\u2019s just say it didn\u2019t end well for her. Not only did Genevieve cut her out of the group, but she told everyone that Jamila\u2019s family had an Indonesian slave living with them, when really it was just her cousin. And I\u2019m pretty sure it was Genevieve who started a rumor online that Jamila washed her hair only once a month. The final straw was when Jamila\u2019s parents got an anonymous e-mail saying that she was having sex with Peter. Her parents transferred her right out and put her in private school. Genevieve and Peter were back together by spring formal.</p><p>\u201cGen says she didn\u2019t have anything to do with that.\u201d</p><p>I give him a get real look. \u201cPlease, Peter. I know her well and so do you. Well, I did know her well. But I don\u2019t think people change at the core. They are who they are.\u201d</p><p>Slowly Peter says, \u201cThat\u2019s right. You two were BFFs back in the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were friends,\u201d I agree. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call us BFFs, but . . .\u201d Wait a minute, why are we talking about me again? \u201cEverybody knows it was Genevieve who told Jamila\u2019s parents. You don\u2019t have to be a detective to figure out that Genevieve was jealous of her. Jamila was the prettiest girl in our grade, next to Genevieve. Gen was always a very jealous person. I remember this one time my dad bought me a . . .\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s staring at me in a thoughtful way, and it\u2019s all of a sudden making me nervous.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just do this for a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s let people think we\u2019re a couple.\u201d</p><p>Wait . . . what?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s driving Gen crazy not knowing what\u2019s up with you and me. Why don\u2019t we let her sit with it a little longer? It\u2019s actually kind of perfect. You date me first, and then Gen will get it that we\u2019re over. You\u2019ll be breaking the seal.\u201d He raises an eyebrow at me. \u201cDo you even know what breaking the seal means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course I know what that means.\u201d I have no idea what that means. I make a mental note to ask Chris the next time I see her.</p><p>Peter comes up close to me, and I scoot backward. He laughs and cocks his head to the side and puts his hands on my shoulders. \u201cSo then break my seal.\u201d</p><p>I let out a nervous laugh. \u201cHa-ha, sorry, Peter, but I\u2019m not interested. In you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. That\u2019s the whole point. I\u2019m not interested in you, either. Like, at all.\u201d Peter shudders. \u201cSo what do you say?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shrug my shoulders so his hands fall away. \u201cHello, I just got through explaining to you how Gen will kill any girl that goes near you!\u201d</p><p>Peter dismisses this. \u201cGen\u2019s all talk. She\u2019d never do anything to anybody. You just don\u2019t know her like I do.\u201d When I don\u2019t say anything, he takes my silence as encouragement, and he says, \u201cIt would help you out too, you know. With that kid Josh. Weren\u2019t you so worried about losing face in front of him? This could save you from more humiliation. Because why would you be with him when you could be with me? Well, pretend be with me. Strictly business, though. I can\u2019t have you falling in love with me, too.\u201d</p><p>It gives me great pleasure to look up into his Handsome Boy face and sweetly say, \u201cPeter, I don\u2019t even want to be your pretend girlfriend, much less your real one.\u201d</p><p>He blinks. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou read my letter. You\u2019re not my type. Nobody would ever believe I would like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to you. I\u2019m just trying to do us both a favor.\u201d Then he shrugs and looks over my shoulder, like he\u2019s bored with this conversation. \u201cBut Josh definitely believed it.\u201d</p><p>In a flash, without even thinking, I say, \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>Hours later, I\u2019m lying in bed that night still marveling about it all. What people will say when they see me walking down the hall with Peter Kavinsky.</p><p>25</p> <p>THE NEXT MORNING, PETER IS waiting in the parking lot for me when I get off the bus. \u201cHey,\u201d he says. \u201cAre you seriously taking the bus every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy car is being fixed, remember? My accident?\u201d</p><p>He sighs like this is somehow offensive to him, me taking the bus to school. Then he grabs my hand and holds it as we walk into school together.</p><p>This is the first time I\u2019ve walked down the school hallway holding hands with a boy. It should feel momentous, special, but it doesn\u2019t, because it\u2019s not real. Honestly, it feels like nothing.</p><p>Emily Nussbaum does a double take when she sees us. Emily is Gen\u2019s best friend. She\u2019s staring so hard I\u2019m surprised she doesn\u2019t take a quick pic on her phone to send to Gen.</p><p>Peter keeps stopping to say hi to people, and I stand there smiling like it\u2019s the most natural thing in the world. Me and Peter Kavinsky.</p> <p>At one point I try to let go of his hand, because mine is starting to feel sweaty, but he tightens his grip. \u201cYour hand is too hot,\u201d I hiss.</p><p>Through clenched teeth he says, \u201cNo, your hand is.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sure Genevieve\u2019s hands are never sweaty. She could probably hold hands for days without getting overheated.</p><p>When we get to my locker, we finally drop hands so I can dump my books inside. I\u2019m shutting my locker door when Peter leans in and tries to kiss me on the mouth. I\u2019m so startled I turn my head, and we hit foreheads.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d Peter rubs his forehead and glares at me.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t just sneak up on me like that!\u201d My forehead hurts too. We really banged them hard, like cymbals. If I looked up right now, I would see blue cartoon birdies.</p><p>\u201cLower your voice, dummy,\u201d he says through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you call me a dummy, you dummy,\u201d I whisper back.</p> <p>Peter heaves a big sigh like he\u2019s really annoyed with me. I\u2019m about to snap at him that it\u2019s his fault, not mine, when I catch a glimpse of Genevieve gliding down the hallway. \u201cGotta go,\u201d I say, and I dart off in the opposite direction.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Peter calls out.</p><p>But I keep darting.</p><p>I\u2019m lying on my bed with my pillow over my face reliving the horrible kiss-that-wasn\u2019t. I keep trying to block it out, but it just keeps coming back.</p><p>I put my hand to my forehead. I don\u2019t think I can do this. It\u2019s all so . . . I mean, the kissing, the sweaty hands, everybody looking. It\u2019s too much.</p><p>I\u2019m just going to have to tell him I changed my mind, and I don\u2019t want to do this anymore, and that\u2019ll be that. I don\u2019t have his number, and I don\u2019t want to say any of this in an e-mail, either. I\u2019ll have to go to his house. It\u2019s not far; I still remember the way.</p><p>I run downstairs, passing Kitty, who is balancing a plate of Oreos and a glass of milk on a tray. \u201cI\u2019m borrowing your bike!\u201d I yell as I fly past her. \u201cI\u2019ll be back soon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better not let anything happen to it!\u201d Kitty yells back.</p><p>I grab her helmet and the bike and tear out of the yard, pedaling as fast as I can. My knees hit my chest a little, but I\u2019m not that much taller than Kitty, so it isn\u2019t so bad. Peter lives two neighborhoods away. It takes me less than twenty minutes to get there.</p><p>When I do, there aren\u2019t any cars in the driveway. Peter\u2019s not home. My heart sinks to the pavement. What do I do now? Sit and wait for him on the front porch like some kind of stalker? What if his mom comes home first?</p><p>I take off my helmet and sit for a minute so I can rest. My hair is damp and sweaty from the ride over, and I\u2019m exhausted. I try to run my fingers through my hair, smooth it out. It\u2019s a lost cause.</p><p>As I\u2019m contemplating texting Chris and seeing if she can come get me, Peter\u2019s car comes roaring down the street and up the driveway. I drop my phone and then scramble to pick it up.</p><p>Peter climbs out of his car and raises his eyebrows at me. \u201cLook who\u2019s here. My adoring girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>I stand up and wave at him. \u201cCan I talk to you for a minute?\u201d</p><p>He slings his backpack over his shoulder and takes his time sauntering over. He sits down on the front step like a prince on his throne, and I stand in front of him, my helmet in one hand and my phone in the other. \u201cSo what\u2019s up?\u201d he drawls. \u201cLet me guess. You\u2019re here to back out on me, am I right?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s so smug, so sure of himself. I don\u2019t want to give him the satisfaction of being right.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to go over our game plan with you,\u201d I say, sitting down. \u201cGet our story straight before people start asking questions.\u201d</p><p>He raises his eyebrows. \u201cOh. Okay. Makes sense. So how did we get together?\u201d</p><p>I clasp my hands in my lap and recite, \u201cWhen I got in that car accident last week, you happened to be driving by, and you waited for Triple A with me and then you drove me home. You were really nervous the whole time, because you\u2019ve actually had kind of a thing for me since middle school. I was your first kiss. So this was your big chance\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were my first kiss?\u201d he interrupts. \u201cHow about I was your first kiss. That\u2019s a lot more believable.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I ignore him and continue on. \u201cThis was your big chance. So you took it. You asked me out that very day and we\u2019ve been hanging out ever since and now we\u2019re basically a couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Gen\u2019s going to buy this,\u201d he says, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d I say in my most patient voice, \u201cthe most believable lies are the ones that are at least a little bit true. I did get into a car accident; you did stop and sit with me; we did kiss in middle school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGen and I hooked up that day after I saw you.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cOkay. Spare me the details. My story still works, though. After the car accident, you couldn\u2019t get me out of your mind, so you asked me out as soon as Genevieve dumped\u2014I mean, as soon as you guys broke up.\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cSince we\u2019re on the topic, I\u2019d also like to set some ground rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of ground rules?\u201d he asks, leaning back.</p><p>I press my lips together and take a breath. \u201cWell . . . I don\u2019t want you trying to kiss me again.\u201d</p> <p>Peter curls his lip at me. \u201cTrust me, I don\u2019t want to do it either. My forehead still hurts from this morning. I think I have a bruise.\u201d He pushes his hair off his forehead. \u201cDo you see a bruise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I see a receding hairline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Ha. I knew that would get him. Peter\u2019s so vain. \u201cCalm down, I\u2019m only kidding. Do you have a piece of paper and a pen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna write this down?\u201d</p><p>Primly I say, \u201cIt\u2019ll help us remember.\u201d</p> <p>Rolling his eyes, Peter reaches into his backpack, pulls out a notebook, and hands it to me. I turn to a clean page and write at the top, Contract. Then I write No kissing.</p><p>\u201cAre people really gonna buy it if we never touch each other in public?\u201d Peter asks, looking skeptical.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think relationships are just about physicality. There are ways to show you care about someone, not just using your lips.\u201d Peter\u2019s smiling, and he looks like he\u2019s about to crack a joke, so I swiftly add, \u201cOr any other body part.\u201d</p><p>He groans. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta give me something here, Lara Jean. I have a reputation to uphold. None of my friends will believe I suddenly turned into a monk to date you. How about at least a hand in your back jean pocket? Trust me, it\u2019ll be strictly professional.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say what I\u2019m thinking, which is that he cares way too much what people think about him. I just nod and write down, Peter is allowed to put a hand in Lara Jean\u2019s back jean pocket. \u201cBut no more kissing,\u201d I say, keeping my head down so he can\u2019t see me blush.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who started it,\u201d he reminds me. \u201cAnd also, I don\u2019t have any STDs, so you can get that out of your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you have any STDs.\u201d I look back up at him. \u201cThe thing is . . . I\u2019ve never had a boyfriend before. I\u2019ve never been on a real date before, or held hands walking down the hallway. This is all new for me, so I\u2019m sorry about the forehead thing this morning. I just . . . wish all of these firsts were happening for real and not with you.\u201d</p><p>Peter seems to be thinking this over. He says, \u201cHuh. Okay. Let\u2019s just save some stuff, then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. We\u2019ll save some stuff for you to do when it\u2019s the real thing and not for show.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m touched. Who knew Peter could be so thoughtful and generous?</p><p>\u201cLike, I won\u2019t pay for stuff. I\u2019ll save that for a guy who really likes you.\u201d</p><p>My smile fades. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting you to pay for anything!\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s on a roll. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t walk you to class or buy you flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get the picture.\u201d It seems to me like Peter\u2019s less concerned about me and more concerned about his wallet. He sure is cheap. \u201cSo when you were with Genevieve, what kinds of things did she like you to do?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s going to take this opportunity to make a joke, but instead he stares off into space and says, \u201cShe was always bitching at me to write her notes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNotes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, at school. I didn\u2019t get why I couldn\u2019t just text her. It\u2019s immediate, it\u2019s efficient. Why not use the technology that\u2019s available to us?\u201d</p><p>This I understand perfectly. Genevieve didn\u2019t want notes. She wanted letters. Real letters written in his handwriting on actual paper that she could hold and keep and read whenever the mood struck her. They were proof, solid and tangible, that someone was thinking about her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll write you a note a day,\u201d Peter says suddenly, with gusto. \u201cThat\u2019ll drive her ass crazy.\u201d</p><p>I write down, Peter will write Lara Jean one note every day.</p><p>Peter leans in. \u201cWrite down that you have to go to some parties with me. And write down no rom coms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about rom coms? Not every girl wants to watch rom coms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can just tell that you\u2019re the kind of girl who does.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m annoyed that he has this perception of me, and even more annoyed that he\u2019s right. I write, NO DUMB ACTION MOVIES.</p><p>\u201cThen what does that leave us with?\u201d Peter demands.</p><p>\u201cSuperhero movies, horror movies, period films, documentaries, foreign films\u2014\u201d</p><p>Peter makes a face, grabs the pen and paper from me, and writes down, NO FOREIGN FILMS. He also writes, Lara Jean will make Peter\u2019s picture her phone wallpaper. \u201cAnd vice versa!\u201d I say. I point my phone at him. \u201cSmile.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiles, and ugh, it\u2019s annoying how handsome he is. Then he reaches for his phone and I stop him. \u201cNot right now. My hair looks sweaty and gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d he says, and I want to punch him.</p><p>\u201cCan you also write down that under no circumstances can either of us tell anyone the truth?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cThe first rule of Fight Club,\u201d Peter says knowingly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen that movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you haven\u2019t,\u201d he says, and I make a face at him. Also: mental note, watch Fight Club.</p><p>Peter writes it down, and then I sit next to him and take the pen and underline \u201cunder no circumstances\u201d twice. \u201cWhat about an end date?\u201d I ask suddenly.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, how long are we going to do this for? Like, two weeks? A month?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Peter shrugs. \u201cFor as long as we feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014don\u2019t you think we should have something set\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cuts me off. \u201cYou need to relax, Lara Jean. Life doesn\u2019t have to be so planned. Just roll with it and let it happen.\u201d</p><p>I sigh and say, \u201cWords of wisdom from the great Kavinsky,\u201d and Peter wiggles his eyebrows at me. \u201cJust as long as it\u2019s over by the time my sister comes back for Christmas break. She can always tell when I\u2019m lying.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, we\u2019ll definitely be done by then,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I say, and then I sign the paper, and so does he, and we have our contract.</p><p>I\u2019m too proud to ask for a ride, and Peter doesn\u2019t offer, so I put my helmet back on and ride Kitty\u2019s bike back home. I\u2019m halfway there when I realize we never exchanged phone numbers. I don\u2019t even know my own supposed boyfriend\u2019s phone number.</p><p>26</p><p>I\u2019M AT MCCALLS BOOKSTORE, PICKING up a copy of The Glass Menagerie for English and scanning the store for Josh. Now that Peter and I have everything worked out, I can triumphantly crow all about it. That\u2019ll show him for thinking I\u2019m just a homebody no boy would want to date.</p> <p>I spot him setting up a display of new books in the nonfiction section. He doesn\u2019t see me, so I sneak up behind and yell, \u201cBoo!\u201d</p><p>He jumps and drops a book on the floor. \u201cYou scared the crap out of me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the point, Joshy!\u201d I\u2019m having a giggle fit. The look on his face! I wonder, why is it so deliciously funny to sneak up on people?</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right. Quit laughing. What are you here for?\u201d</p><p>I hold up my book and wave it in his face. \u201cI have Mr. Radnor for English. You had him, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s good. He\u2019s strict but fair. I still have my notes if you want them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say. Brightly I add, \u201cSo guess what. Peter and I aren\u2019t broken up after all. It was just a misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Josh starts stacking books into a column.</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm. I saw him yesterday and we talked and talked, for hours. I feel like I could talk to him about anything, you know? He just really gets me.\u201d</p><p>Josh\u2019s forehead wrinkles. \u201cWhat do you guys talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, everything. Movies, books, the usual stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. I never saw him as the reading type.\u201d He squints and looks over my shoulder. \u201cHey, I\u2019ve gotta go help Janice out at the counter. When you\u2019re ready to check out, come to my register so I can give you my discount.\u201d</p><p>Hmm, this isn\u2019t exactly the reaction I was hoping for. I barely even got a chance to crow. \u201cSounds good,\u201d I say, but he\u2019s already walking away.</p><p>I hug my book to my chest. Now that Josh knows I\u2019m not in love with him anymore and I\u2019m with Peter, I guess everything will slide right back into place and be normal again. Like my letter never happened.</p> <p>27</p><p>\u201cMARGOT CALLED WHEN YOU WERE out today,\u201d my dad says over dinner.</p><p>Dinner is just salad. Salad for me and Daddy and cereal for Kitty. There were supposed to be chicken breasts, but I forgot to take them out of the freezer this morning, so there\u2019s just lettuce and carrot with balsamic dressing. Daddy\u2019s supplementing his with two boiled eggs, and I have a piece of buttered toast. Some dinner. Cereal and lettuce. I need to get to the grocery store stat.</p><p>Since Margot left, I\u2019ve only spoken to her twice, and once was over video chat with all of us crowded around my laptop. I didn\u2019t get to ask her about the good stuff\u2014the real deal, all the adventures she\u2019s been going on and the people she\u2019s been meeting. I think I heard that British people drink absinthe at pubs. I wonder if she\u2019s tried it by now. I\u2019ve e-mailed Margot so many times and have only gotten back one e-mail in return so far. I understand that she is busy, but the least she can do is e-mail back once a day. For all she knows, I could be dead in a ditch. \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d I ask as I cut my carrot into tiny pieces.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s thinking about trying out for the shinty club team,\u201d my dad says, wiping salad dressing off his chin.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s shinty?\u201d Kitty asks me, and I shrug.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Scottish sport that\u2019s similar to field hockey,\u201d Daddy explains. \u201cIt started out as safe swordfight practice in medieval Scotland.\u201d</p><p>Boring. Before Daddy can get started on telling us more about medieval Scotland, I say, \u201cLet\u2019s send Gogo a care package! Stuff she can\u2019t get over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Kitty cheers.</p><p>\u201cWhat should we send?\u201d I ask. \u201cI say we all contribute something.\u201d</p><p>Daddy chews and taps his finger to his chin. \u201cI\u2019ll send gummy vitamins,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd Advil. I think she only took a small bottle of Advil, and you know how she gets migraines sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI approve.\u201d I point my fork at Kitty. \u201cAnd what about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got something I could send,\u201d Kitty says. \u201cShould I go get it?\u201d</p><p>Daddy and I look at each other and shrug. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Kitty comes running back with a picture she\u2019s drawn of Margot. Petting a dog. The exact breed of dog Kitty wants. Akita. I have to laugh.</p><p>Kitty frowns. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s good enough?\u201d Kitty asks me. \u201cGood enough to hang up on her wall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cNo, I want you to really look at it,\u201d she says. \u201cCritique it. I can always do better. Margot won\u2019t want it if it\u2019s not my best work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitty, it definitely is,\u201d I say. \u201cWhy would I lie?\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s finished yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly the artist knows,\u201d Daddy says with a sage nod.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think about the dog?\u201d she asks him. \u201cIsn\u2019t it cute?\u201d</p><p>Daddy takes the picture from me and looks at it closely. \u201cYes, the dog is undeniably a good-looking dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Asian too,\u201d she says. Kitty sits back down and takes a bite of cereal and tries not to smile. She is doing her inception thing. Planting positive associations about dogs in Daddy\u2019s head. The kid never rests. She always has an angle.</p><p>\u201cWhat else is going in the care package?\u201d Kitty wants to know.</p><p>I start ticking off with my fingers. \u201cTampons because I don\u2019t know if they have our brand in Scotland, flannel pj\u2019s, thick socks, Girl Scout cookies\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere are we going to get Girl Scout cookies this time of year?\u201d Daddy asks.</p><p>\u201cI have a box of Thin Mints hidden in the freezer,\u201d I say.</p><p>He gives me a hurt look. \u201cHidden from who?\u201d Thin Mints are his favorite.

I think that\u2019s it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget her brown boots,\u201d my dad reminds me. \u201cShe specifically requested we send her brown boots with the laces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she?\u201d I was hoping Margot hadn\u2019t noticed she\u2019d left them behind. \u201cWhen did she say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe e-mailed me yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see if I can find them.\u201d</p><p>My dad says, \u201cWeren\u2019t you wearing them this weekend?\u201d and at the same time Kitty says, \u201cThey\u2019re in your closet.\u201d</p> <p>I throw up my hands. \u201cAll right, all right!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you get the box together tonight, I can drop it off at the post office tomorrow morning on my way to work,\u201d Daddy offers.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI want to send the scarf I\u2019ve been knitting, and it won\u2019t be ready in time. Maybe in another week or two?\u201d</p><p>Slurping her milk, Kitty waves a hand at me and advises, \u201cJust give up on the scarf already. Knitting isn\u2019t your thing.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to argue and then close it. Maybe she\u2019s right. If we wait for my scarf to be done to send the care package, Margot will probably be out of college already. \u201cAll right,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019ll send the care package sans scarf. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m giving up on knitting, though. I\u2019ll keep chugging along on it and have it ready for you for your Christmas gift, Kitty.\u201d I smile at her sweetly. \u201cIt\u2019s pink. Your favorite.\u201d</p><p>Kitty\u2019s eyes go wide with horror. \u201cOr Margot. You could also give it to Margot.\u201d</p> <p>Kitty slides a piece of paper under my door that night. It\u2019s her Christmas list. It\u2019s only September\u2014Christmas is still months away! \u201cPuppy\u201d is written at the top in capital block letters. She also wants an ant farm and a skateboard and a TV in her room. Yeah, that TV\u2019s not going to happen. I could buy her the ant farm, though. Or maybe I could talk to Daddy about the puppy. She hasn\u2019t said so, but I think she misses Margot a lot. In a way, Margot is the only mother she\u2019s known. It must be hard for Kitty having her so far away. I\u2019ll just have to remind myself to be more patient with her, more attentive. She needs me now.</p><p>I go to her room and climb into her bed. She\u2019s just turned the lights off but is already halfway to sleep. \u201cWhat if we got a kitten?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>Her eyes fly open. \u201cNo way in heck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think we\u2019re more of a kitten family?\u201d Dreamily I say, \u201cA fluffy gray-and-white kitten with a bushy tail. We could name him Prince if it\u2019s a boy. Ooh, or Gandalf the Gray! Wouldn\u2019t that be cute? Or if it\u2019s a girl, maybe Agatha. Or Tilly. Or Boss. It really depends on her personality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit it,\u201d Kitty warns. \u201cWe\u2019re not getting a cat. Cats are blah. They\u2019re also very manipulative.\u201d</p><p>Impressed, I say, \u201cWhere\u2019d you learn that word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA puppy is a lot of work. Who\u2019s going to feed him and walk him and house-train him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll do it all. I\u2019m responsible enough to take care of it on my own.\u201d</p><p>I snuggle closer to her. I love the way Kitty\u2019s head smells after she\u2019s had a bath. \u201cHa! You don\u2019t even do the dishes ever. And you never clean your room. And when have you ever helped fold laundry even once in your life? I mean, really, if you don\u2019t do any of those things, how you can be responsible for another living creature?\u201d</p><p>Kitty shoves me off. \u201cThen I\u2019ll help more!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I help out more, will you help me convince Daddy about the puppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you help out more,\u201d I agree. \u201cIf you can prove to me you\u2019re not a baby anymore.\u201d Kitty will be ten in January. That\u2019s plenty old enough to help out around the house. Margot babies her too much, I think. \u201cI\u2019m putting you in charge of emptying the upstairs trash cans once a week. And helping with the laundry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo . . . would I get a raise in my allowance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The incentive is me helping you convince Daddy to get a dog, and also you not being so babyish anymore.\u201d I fluff up my pillow. \u201cBy the way, I\u2019m sleeping in here tonight.\u201d</p><p>Kitty gives me a swift kick and I almost fall out of the bed. \u201cYou\u2019re the babyish one, not me, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let me sleep in here one night!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou take up all the covers.\u201d</p><p>Kitty tries to kick me again, but I make my body heavy and pretend I\u2019m already asleep. Soon we both fall asleep for real.</p><p>Sunday night I\u2019m doing my homework in bed when I get a call from a number I don\u2019t recognize. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm . . . sorry, but who\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Peter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. How did you get my number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a longish silence. It\u2019s agonizing, every millisecond that ticks by with neither of us talking, but I don\u2019t know what to say. \u201cSo, what did you want?\u201d</p><p>Peter laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re so awk, Covey. Your car\u2019s in the shop, right? So how about I pick you up for school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO-kay . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye,\u201d I say, and I hang up.</p><p>28</p><p>THE NEXT MORNING, I WAKE kitty up early so she can braid my hair. \u201cLeave me alone,\u201d she says, rolling on to her other side. \u201cI\u2019m sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease please please can I get a braid crown?\u201d I ask her, squatting in front of her bed.</p><p>\u201cNo. You can have a side braid and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Swiftly Kitty braids my braid, and then she falls right back to sleep and I\u2019m on my way to figure out clothes. Now that Peter and I are official, people will be noticing me more, so I should wear something good. I try on a polka-dot puffy-sleeved dress with tights, but it doesn\u2019t look right. Neither does my favorite heart sweater with the little pom-poms. Everything looks so kiddish all of a sudden. I finally settle on a floral babydoll dress I ordered off a Japanese street fashion site, with ankle boots. Sort of a seventies London look. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I run downstairs at seven twenty-five, Kitty is sitting at the kitchen table with her jean jacket on waiting for me. \u201cWhy are you downstairs already?\u201d I ask her. Her bus doesn\u2019t come until eight.</p><p>\u201cI have my field trip today, so I have to go to school early. Remember?\u201d</p><p>I run and look at the calendar on the refrigerator. There it is, in my handwriting: Kitty\u2019s Field Trip. Shoot.</p><p>I was supposed to drive her, but that was before my car accident. Daddy had an overnight shift at the hospital and he\u2019s not home yet, so I don\u2019t have a car. \u201cCan one of the carpool moms come get you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late. The bus leaves at seven forty.\u201d Kitty\u2019s face is getting splotchy and her chin is starting to quiver. \u201cI can\u2019t miss the bus, Lara Jean!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Don\u2019t get upset. I\u2019ve got a ride coming for us right now. Don\u2019t worry, okay?\u201d I pluck a greenish banana from the banana hammock. \u201cLet\u2019s go outside and wait for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust hurry.\u201d</p><p>Kitty and I are waiting on the front steps sharing the greenish banana. We both prefer an unripe, greenish banana to a brown speckled one. It\u2019s Margot who likes the speckled ones. I\u2019ll try to save them for banana bread, but Margot gobbles them up, mushy bruised parts and all. I shudder to even think of it.</p> <p>There\u2019s a chill in the air, even though it\u2019s still September and therefore practically still summer. Kitty rubs her legs to keep warm. She says she\u2019ll wear shorts all the way to October; that\u2019s her plan.</p><p>It\u2019s past seven thirty now and no Peter yet. I\u2019m starting to get nervous, but I don\u2019t want Kitty to worry. I decide that if he\u2019s not here in exactly two minutes, I\u2019ll go next door to Josh\u2019s and ask him to run Kitty over to school.</p><p>Across the street, our neighbor Ms. Rothschild waves at us as she locks her front door, a big coffee thermos in her hand. She dashes toward her car.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Ms. Rothschild,\u201d we chorus. I elbow Kitty and say, \u201cFive, four, three\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d Ms. Rothschild shrieks. Ms. Rothschild has spilled coffee on her hand. She does this at least twice a week. I don\u2019t know why she doesn\u2019t just slow down or maybe just put the top on the thermos or not fill it up so high.</p><p>Just then Peter drives up, and his black Audi is even shinier in the daylight. I get up and say, \u201cCome on, Kitty,\u201d and she trails behind me.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d I hear her whisper.</p><p>His windows are down. I come up close to the passenger side and stick my head in. \u201cIs it okay if we drop my little sister off at the elementary school?\u201d I ask. \u201cShe has to be there early today for a field trip.\u201d</p><p>Peter looks annoyed. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you mention it yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know about it yesterday!\u201d Behind me I can feel rather than hear Kitty fidgeting.</p><p>\u201cThis is a two-seater,\u201d Peter says, as if I can\u2019t see with my own two eyes.</p><p>\u201cI know that. I\u2019ll just put Kitty in my lap and the seat belt over us.\u201d Which my dad would kill me for if he knew, but I\u2019m not telling, and neither will Kitty.</p><p>\u201cYeah, \u2019cause that sounds really safe.\u201d He\u2019s being sarcastic. I hate when people are sarcastic. It\u2019s so cheap.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s two miles!\u201d</p> <p>He sighs. \u201cFine. Get in.\u201d</p><p>I open the door and slide in, laying my bag at my feet. \u201cCome on, Kitty.\u201d I make space for her between my legs, and she climbs in. I strap us in tight, my arms around her. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Daddy,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cDuh,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cHey. What\u2019s your name?\u201d Peter asks her.</p><p>Kitty hesitates. More and more this happens. With new people she has to decide if she\u2019ll be Kitty or Katherine.</p><p>\u201cKatherine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut everyone calls you Kitty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone who knows me,\u201d Kitty says. \u201cYou can call me Katherine.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes light up. \u201cYou\u2019re tough,\u201d he says admiringly, which Kitty ignores, but she keeps sneaking peeks at him. He has that effect on people. On girls. Women, even.</p><p>We drive through the neighborhood in silence. At last Kitty says, \u201cSo who are you?\u201d</p><p>I look over at him and he\u2019s looking straight ahead. \u201cI\u2019m Peter. Your sister\u2019s, um, boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>My mouth drops. We never said anything about lying to our families! I thought this was going to be an at-school-only thing.</p><p>Kitty goes completely still in my arms. Then she twists around to look at me and shrieks, \u201cHe\u2019s your boyfriend? Since when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince last week.\u201d At least that much is the truth. Sort of.</p><p>\u201cBut you never said anything! Not one frigging word, Lara Jean!\u201d</p><p>Automatically I say, \u201cDon\u2019t say \u2018frig.\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot one frigging word,\u201d Kitty repeats with a shake of her head.</p><p>Peter cracks up, and I give him a dirty look. \u201cIt all happened really fast,\u201d he offers. \u201cThere was barely time to tell anybody\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I talking to you?\u201d Kitty snaps. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. I was talking to my sister.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widen, and I can see him trying to keep a straight face.</p><p>\u201cDoes Margot know?\u201d she asks me.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, and don\u2019t you go mentioning it to her before I have a chance to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d This seems to appease Kitty a tiny bit. Knowing something first, before Margot, is a big deal.</p><p>Then we\u2019re at the elementary school, and thank God the bus is still there in the parking lot. All the kids are lined up in front of it. I let out the breath I\u2019ve been holding the whole way over, and Kitty is already untangling herself from me and bounding out of the car. \u201cHave a good time on the field trip!\u201d I call out.</p><p>She spins back around and points an accusing finger at me. \u201cI want to hear the whole story when I get home!\u201d With that decree she\u2019s off running for the bus loop.</p><p>I rebuckle my seat belt. \u201cUm, I don\u2019t remember us deciding to tell our families that we\u2019re boyfriend-girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was going to have to find out at some point, with me chauffeuring you and her around town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to say \u2018boyfriend.\u2019 You could\u2019ve just said \u2018friend.\u2019?\u201d We\u2019re getting close to school now, just two more lights. I give my side braid a nervous tug. \u201cUm, so have you talked to Genevieve at all?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Peter frowns. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t said a word to you about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. But I\u2019m sure she will soon.\u201d</p><p>Peter speeds into the parking lot and zooms into a space. When we get out of the car and head for the entrance, Peter\u2019s fingers lace through mine. I think he\u2019s going to drop me off at my locker like he did before, but he leads us in the opposite direction.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cCafeteria.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m about to protest, but before I can, he says firmly, \u201cWe need to start hanging out in public more. The caf is where we\u2019ll get the most bang for our buck.\u201d</p><p>Josh won\u2019t be in the cafeteria\u2014that\u2019s for popular people\u2014but I know who will most certainly be there: Genevieve.</p><p>When we walk in, she\u2019s holding court at their lunch table\u2014her and Emily Nussbaum and Gabe and Darrell from the lacrosse team. They\u2019re all eating breakfast and drinking coffee. She must have a sixth sense where Peter is concerned, because she beams lasers at us immediately. I start slowing down, which Peter doesn\u2019t seem to notice. Peter makes a beeline for the table, but at the last second I chicken out. I tug on his hand and say, \u201cLet\u2019s sit over here,\u201d and point to an empty table in their line of vision.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\u2014please.\u201d I think fast. \u201cBecause, you see, it would be too blatantly jerky of you to bring a girl to the table after you\u2019ve only been broken up for, like, a minute. And this way Genevieve can watch from afar and wonder for just a little bit longer.\u201d And also, I\u2019m terrified.</p><p>As I drag Peter over to the table, he waves to his friends, shrugging his shoulders like Whaddareyougonnado? I sit down and Peter sits down next to me. He pulls my chair closer to his. Raising his eyebrows, he asks, \u201cAre you that afraid of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Yes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to face her sometime.\u201d Peter leans forward and grabs my hand again and starts tracing the lines on my palm.</p><p>\u201cQuit,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019re creeping me out.\u201d</p> <p>He flashes me a hurt look. \u201cGirls love it when I do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Genevieve loves it. Or she pretends to love it. You know, now that I think of it, you actually don\u2019t have that much experience when it comes to girls. Just one girl.\u201d I take my hand away from his and perch it on the table. \u201cI mean, everybody thinks you\u2019re this big ladies\u2019 man, when in reality you\u2019ve only ever been with Genevieve and then Jamila for like a month\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. I get it. Enough already. They\u2019re watching us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is? Your table?\u201d</p><p>Peter shrugs. \u201cEveryone.\u201d</p><p>I do a quick look around. He\u2019s right. Everyone is watching us. Peter\u2019s so used to people watching him, but I\u2019m not. It feels funny, like a new sweater that makes my skin feel itchy. Because no one ever watches me. It\u2019s like being onstage. And the funny thing, the really strange thing is, it\u2019s not an altogether unpleasant feeling.</p><p>I\u2019m pondering this when my eyes meet Genevieve\u2019s. There\u2019s this very brief moment of recognition between us, like I know you. Then she looks away and whispers something to Emily. Genevieve is looking at me like I am a tasty morsel and she is going to eat me alive and then spit out my bones. And then, just as quickly, the look is gone and she\u2019s smiling.</p><p>I shiver. The truth is, Genevieve scared me even when we were kids. One time I was playing at her house, and Margot called looking for me to come home for lunch, and Genevieve told her I wasn\u2019t there. She wouldn\u2019t let me leave because she wanted to keep playing dollhouse. She kept blocking the door. I had to call for her mom.</p> <p>The clock reads five minutes past eight. The bell\u2019s going to ring soon. \u201cWe should get going,\u201d I say, and when I stand up, my knees feel shaky. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s distracted because he was looking over at his table of friends. \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d Peter gets up and propels me toward the door; he keeps one hand on the small of my back. With his other hand he waves at his friends. \u201cSmile,\u201d he whispers to me, so I do.</p><p>I have to admit, it\u2019s not a bad feeling, having a boy sweep you along, usher you through crowds. It\u2019s the feeling of being cared for. It\u2019s kind of like walking in a dream. I\u2019m still me and Peter\u2019s still Peter, but everything around me feels fuzzy and unreal, like the time Margot and I snuck champagne on New Year\u2019s Eve.</p><p>I never knew it before, but I think maybe all this time I\u2019ve been invisible. Just someone who was there. Now that people think I\u2019m Peter Kavinsky\u2019s girlfriend, they\u2019re wondering about me. Like, why? What about me made Peter like me? What do I have? What makes me so special? I would be wondering too.</p><p>I am now a Mysterious Girl. Before I was just a Quiet Girl. But becoming Peter\u2019s girlfriend has elevated me to Mysterious Girl.</p><p>I take the bus home from school because Peter has to go to lacrosse practice. I sit in the front the way I\u2019ve been doing, but today people have questions for me. Underclassmen, mostly, because hardly any upperclassmen take the bus.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with you and Kavinsky?\u201d a sophomore girl named Manda asks me. I pretend like I don\u2019t hear her.</p><p>Instead I sink lower into my seat and open up the note Peter left for me in my locker.</p><p>Dear Lara Jean,</p><p>Good job today.</p><p>Peter</p><p>I start to smile and then I hear Manda whisper to her friend, \u201cIt\u2019s so weird that Kavinsky would like her. I mean . . . look at her and then look at Genevieve.\u201d I can feel myself shrink. Is that what everyone thinks? Maybe it\u2019s not that I\u2019m a Mysterious Girl. Maybe it\u2019s that I\u2019m a Not Good Enough Girl.</p><p>When I get home, I go straight to my room, put on a soft nightgown, and release my braid. It\u2019s sweet relief to let it out. My scalp is tingling with gratitude. Then I lie in my bed and stare out the window until it gets dark. My phone keeps buzzing, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s Chris, but I don\u2019t lift my head to look.</p><p>Kitty barges in at one point and says, \u201cAre you sick? Why are you still lying in bed like you have cancer like Brielle\u2019s mom did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need peace,\u201d I say, closing my eyes. \u201cI need to replenish myself with peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . then what are we eating for dinner?\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s a Monday. I\u2019m in charge of dinner on Mondays now. Ugh, Margot, where are you? It\u2019s dark already, there\u2019s not enough time to defrost anything. Maybe Mondays should be pizza nights. I eye her. \u201cDo you have any money?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We both get an allowance\u2014Kitty gets five dollars a week and I get twenty, but Kitty always has more money than me. She saves everything like a wily squirrel. I don\u2019t know where she keeps it, because she locks the door whenever she goes to take any out of her stash. And she\u2019ll lend it, but she charges interest. Margot has a credit card that she\u2019s allowed to use for groceries and gas, but she took that with her. I should probably ask Daddy about getting me one too, now that I\u2019m the oldest sister.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to order a pizza for dinner.\u201d Kitty opens her mouth to negotiate, but before she can get a word in, I say, \u201cDaddy will pay you back when he gets home, so don\u2019t even think about charging me interest. The pizza\u2019s for you, too, you know. A twenty ought to do it.\u201d</p><p>Kitty crosses her arms. \u201cI\u2019ll give you the money, but first you have to tell me about that boy from this morning. Your boyfriend.\u201d</p> <p>I groan. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know how you got together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe used to be friends back in middle school, remember? We\u2019d all hang out in the Pearces\u2019 tree house sometimes.\u201d Kitty gives me a blank shrug. \u201cWell, remember that day I got in a car accident?\u201d Kitty nods. \u201cWell, Peter was driving by, and he stopped and helped me. And we just . . . reconnected. It was fate.\u201d Actually, this is good practice, telling Kitty this story. I\u2019ll tell Chris the same story tonight.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? That\u2019s the whole story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s a pretty good story,\u201d I say. \u201cI mean, a car accident is very dramatic, plus our history together.\u201d</p> <p>Kitty just says, \u201cHmm,\u201d and she leaves it at that.</p><p>We have sausage and mushroom pizza for dinner, and when I broach the idea of Pizza Mondays, Daddy is quick to agree. I think he\u2019s remembering my bo ssam mac and cheese.</p><p>It\u2019s a relief that Kitty spends most of dinner talking about her field trip and all I have to do is chew on my pizza. I\u2019m still thinking about what Manda said and wondering if maybe this wasn\u2019t such a good idea after all.</p><p>When Kitty pauses to inhale her slice, Daddy turns to me and says, \u201cDid anything interesting happen to you today?\u201d</p><p>I swallow my mouthful of pizza. \u201cUm . . . not really.\u201d</p><p>Later that night I fix myself a bubble bath and soak in the tub for so long Kitty bangs on the door twice to check if I\u2019ve fallen asleep. Once I almost do.</p> <p>I\u2019ve just drifted off when my phone buzzes. It\u2019s Chris. I hit ignore, but then it keeps buzzing, and buzzing, and buzzing. I finally just pick up.</p><p>\u201cIs it true?\u201d she screams.</p><p>I hold the phone away from my ear. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my gawd. Tell me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, Chris. I\u2019ll tell you everything tomorrow. Good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight!\u201d</p><p>29</p> <p>THAT FRIDAY I GO TO my first ever football game. I\u2019ve never had even the tiniest bit of interest in it before, and I still don\u2019t. I\u2019m sitting high in the stands with Peter and his friends, and as far as I can tell, there\u2019s not a lot to see. It just seems like a lot of waiting and huddling and not a lot of action. Nothing at all like football games in the movies and on TV shows.</p><p>By nine thirty the game\u2019s almost over, I hope, and I\u2019m yawning into my coat when Peter suddenly throws his arm around me. I nearly choke on my yawn.</p><p>Down below, Genevieve is cheering with the rest of the squad. She is shimmying and shaking her pom-poms. She looks up in the stands, and when she sees us, she stops for just a half second before launching into a new cheer, eyes blazing.</p><p>I glance at Peter, who has a satisfied smirk on. When Genevieve\u2019s back on the sidelines, he drops his arm and suddenly seems to remember I\u2019m there. He says, \u201cEli\u2019s having people over tonight. Wanna go?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even know who Eli is. I yawn again, a big one for show. \u201cUm . . . I\u2019m really tired. So . . . no. No, thank you. Can you just drop me off on the way there?\u201d</p><p>Peter gives me a look, but he doesn\u2019t argue.</p><p>On the way home, we pass by the diner and Peter suddenly says, \u201cI\u2019m hungry. Do you want to stop and get something?\u201d Pointedly he adds, \u201cOr are you too tired?\u201d</p><p>I ignore the dig and say, \u201cSure, I can eat.\u201d</p><p>So Peter turns the car around and we go to the diner. We get a booth up front. Whenever I used to come here with Margot and Josh, we would always sit in the back near the jukebox so we could put coins in. Half the time the jukebox was broken, but we still liked sitting near it. It\u2019s weird to be here without them. We have so many traditions here. The three of us would get two grilled-cheese sandwiches and cut them up into squares, and we\u2019d order a bowl of tomato soup to dip the squares in, and then Josh and I would share a waffle with extra whipped cream for dessert and Margot would have a bowl of tapioca pudding. Gross, I know. I\u2019m pretty sure only grandmas like tapioca pudding.</p><p>Our waitress is Kelly, who\u2019s a student at the college. She was gone all summer, and I guess now she\u2019s back. She eyes Peter as she sets down our waters. \u201cWhere are your friends tonight?\u201d she asks me.</p><p>I say, \u201cMargot\u2019s left for Scotland, and Josh . . . isn\u2019t here.\u201d Which Peter rolls his eyes at.</p><p>Then Peter orders blueberry pancakes and bacon and scrambled eggs. I get a grilled cheese with fries on the side and a black-cherry soda.</p><p>When Kelly leaves to put in our orders, I ask him, \u201cWhy do you hate Josh so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate him,\u201d Peter scoffs. \u201cI barely know the guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you certainly don\u2019t like him.\u201d</p><p>Peter scowls at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s to like? That kid turned me in once for cheating in seventh grade.\u201d</p><p>Peter cheated? My stomach twists a little. \u201cWhat kind of cheating was it? Like, homework?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, a Spanish test. I wrote down the answers in my calculator, and Josh freaking told on me. Who does that?\u201d</p><p>I search his face for some sign of embarrassment or shame at having cheated, but I don\u2019t see even an iota. \u201cWhat are you so high and mighty for? You\u2019re the one who cheated!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was seventh grade!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, do you still cheat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Hardly ever. I mean, I have.\u201d He frowns at me. \u201cWould you quit looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith judgey eyes. Look, I\u2019m going to school on a lacrosse scholarship anyway, so what does it matter?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I have a sudden revelation. I lower my voice and say, \u201cWait . . . can you read?\u201d</p><p>He bursts out laughing. \u201cYes, I can read! Geez, Lara Jean. Not everything has a story behind it, okay? I\u2019m just lazy.\u201d He snorts. \u201cCan I read? I\u2019ve written you multiple notes! You\u2019re hilarious.\u201d</p><p>I can feel my face get flushed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that funny.\u201d I squint at him. \u201cIs everything a joke to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everything, but most things, sure.\u201d</p> <p>I drop my chin. \u201cThen maybe that\u2019s a character flaw that you should work on,\u201d I say. \u201cBecause some things are serious and they should be taken seriously. Sorry if you think that\u2019s me being judgey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, I think that\u2019s judgey. I think you\u2019re judgey in general. That\u2019s a character flaw that you should work on. I also think you need to learn how to kick back and have fun.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m listing off all the ways I have fun\u2014biking (which I hate), baking, reading; I consider saying knitting but I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019ll only make fun of me\u2014when Kelly drops off our food and I stop so I can bite into my grilled cheese while it\u2019s still oozy.</p><p>Peter steals one of my french fries. \u201cSo who else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else what?\u201d</p> <p>With his mouth full, he says, \u201cWho else got letters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, that\u2019s really private.\u201d I shake my head at him, like Wow, how rude.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m just curious.\u201d Peter dips another fry into my little ramekin of ketchup. Smirking, he says, \u201cCome on, don\u2019t be shy. You can tell me. I know I\u2019m number one, obviously. But I want to hear who else made the cut.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s practically flexing, he\u2019s so sure of himself. Fine, if he wants to know so bad, I\u2019ll tell him. \u201cJosh, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKenny.\u201d</p> <p>Peter snorts. \u201cKenny? Who\u2019s he?\u201d</p><p>I prop my elbows up on the table and rest my chin on my hands. \u201cA boy I met at church camp. He was the best swimmer of the whole boys\u2019 side. He saved a drowning kid once. He swam out to the middle of the lake before the lifeguards even noticed anything was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019d he say when he got the letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. It was sent back return to sender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, who\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>I take a bite of sandwich. \u201cLucas Krapf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gay,\u201d Peter says.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not gay!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDude, quit dreaming. The kid is gay. He wore an ascot to school yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he was wearing it ironically. Besides, wearing an ascot doesn\u2019t make someone gay.\u201d I give him a look like Wow, so homophobic.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t give me that look,\u201d he objects. \u201cMy favorite uncle\u2019s gay as hell. I bet you fifty bucks that if I showed my uncle Eddie a picture of Lucas, he\u2019d confirm it in half a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because Lucas appreciates fashion, that doesn\u2019t make him gay.\u201d Peter opens his mouth to argue but I lift up a hand to quiet him. \u201cAll it means is he\u2019s more of a city guy in the midst of all this . . . this boring suburbia. I bet you he ends up going to NYU or some other place in New York. He could be a TV actor. He\u2019s got that look, you know. Svelte with fine-boned features. Very sensitive features. He looks like . . . like an angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what did Angel Boy say about the letter, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing . . . I\u2019m sure because he\u2019s a gentleman and didn\u2019t want to embarrass me by bringing it up.\u201d I give him a meaningful look. Unlike some people is what I\u2019m saying with my eyes.</p><p>Peter rolls his eyes. \u201cAll right, all right. Whatever, I don\u2019t care.\u201d He leans back in his seat and stretches his arm out on the back of the empty seat next to him. \u201cThat\u2019s only four. Who\u2019s the fifth?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m surprised he\u2019s been keeping count. \u201cJohn Ambrose McClaren.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cMcClaren? When did you like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighth grade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you liked me in eighth grade!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere may have been a little bit of overlap,\u201d I admit. Stirring my straw, I say, \u201cThere was this one time, in gym . . . he and I had to pick up all the soccer balls, and it started to rain . . .\u201d I sigh. \u201cIt was probably the most romantic thing that ever happened to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it with girls and rain?\u201d Peter wonders.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know . . . I guess maybe because everything feels more dramatic in the rain,\u201d I say with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cDid anything actually happen with you two, or were you just standing out in the rain picking up soccer balls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d Someone like Peter could never understand.</p><p>Peter rolls his eyes. \u201cSo did McClaren\u2019s letter get sent to his old house?\u201d he prompts.</p><p>\u201cI think so. I never heard anything back from him.\u201d I take a long sip of my soda.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you sound so sad about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d</p><p>Maybe I am, a little. Besides Josh, I think John Ambrose McClaren matters the most to me of all the boys I\u2019ve loved. There was just something so sweet about him. It was the promise of maybe, maybe one day. I think John Ambrose McClaren must be the One That Got Away. Out loud I say, \u201cI mean, either he never got my letter or he did, and . . .\u201d I shrug. \u201cI just always wondered how he turned out. If he\u2019s still the same. I bet he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what, I think maybe he mentioned you once.\u201d Slowly he says, \u201cYeah, he definitely did. He said he thought you were the prettiest girl in our grade. He said his one regret from middle school was not asking you to the eighth-grade formal.\u201d</p><p>My whole body goes still and I think I even stop breathing. \u201cFor real?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>Peter busts up laughing. \u201cDude! You\u2019re so gullible!\u201d</p><p>My stomach squeezes. Blinking, I say, \u201cThat was really mean. Why would you say that?\u201d</p><p>Peter stops laughing and says, \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry. I was just kidding\u2014\u201d</p><p>I reach across the table and punch him in the shoulder, hard. \u201cYou\u2019re a jerk.\u201d</p><p>He rubs his shoulder and cries out, \u201cOw! That hurt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you deserved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says again. But there\u2019s still a trace of laughter in his eyes, so I turn my head away from him. \u201cHey, come on. Don\u2019t be mad. Who knows? Maybe he did like you. Let\u2019s call him and find out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My head snaps up. \u201cYou have his phone number?

Let\u2019s call him right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I try to grab his phone away from him, but he\u2019s too quick. He holds his phone above my head and I can\u2019t reach. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare call him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I thought you were so curious about what ever happened to him.\u201d</p> <p>I shake my head fervently.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you so afraid of? That he doesn\u2019t remember you?\u201d Something changes in his face, some dawning realization about me. \u201cOr that he does?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Peter nods to himself; he tips back in his chair, his hands linked around his head.</p><p>I don\u2019t like the way he\u2019s looking at me. Like he thinks he\u2019s figured me out. I hold my palm out to him. \u201cGive me your phone.\u201d</p> <p>Peter\u2019s jaw drops. \u201cYou\u2019re going to call him? Right now?\u201d</p><p>I like that I\u2019ve surprised him. It makes me feel like I\u2019ve won something back. I think throwing Peter off guard could be a fun hobby for me. In a commanding voice I\u2019ve only ever used with Kitty, I say, \u201cJust give me your phone.\u201d Peter hands me his phone, and I copy John\u2019s number into mine. \u201cI\u2019ll call him when I feel like it, not because you feel like it.\u201d</p><p>Peter gives me a look of grudging respect. Of course I\u2019m never going to call John, but Peter K. doesn\u2019t need to know that.</p><p>That night, I\u2019m lying in bed still thinking about John. It\u2019s fun to think of the what-if. Scary, but fun. It\u2019s like, I thought this door was closed before, but here it is open just the tiniest crack. What if? What would that be like, me and John Ambrose McClaren? If I close my eyes, I can almost picture it.</p><p>30</p><p>MARGOT AND I ARE ON the phone; it\u2019s Saturday afternoon here and Saturday night there. \u201cHave you lined up an internship for the spring?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet . . .\u201d</p><p>Margot lets out a sigh. \u201cI thought you were going to try and do something at Montpelier. I know they need help in the archives. Do you want me to call Donna for you?\u201d</p><p>Margot did an internship at Montpelier for two summers and she loved it. She was there for some important dig where they found a shard of Dolley Madison\u2019s china plate, and you\u2019d have thought they found diamonds or a dinosaur bone. Everybody loves Margot over there. When she left, they gave her a plaque for all her hard work. Daddy hung it up in the living room.</p><p>\u201cMontpelier\u2019s too far of a drive,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWhat about volunteering at the hospital?\u201d she suggests. \u201cYou could get a ride with Daddy on the days you have to go in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t like the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the library! You like the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already filled out an application,\u201d I lie.</p> <p>\u201cHave you really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I was just about to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to push you to want things. You should want them for yourself. You need to take the initiative. I\u2019m not always going to be beside you to push you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, do you realize how important this year is, Lara Jean? It\u2019s kind of everything. You don\u2019t get a do-over: this is junior year.\u201d</p><p>I can feel tears and panic building up inside me. If she asks me another question, it will be too much, and I\u2019ll cry.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still here.\u201d My voice comes out tiny, and I know Margot knows how close I am to crying.</p><p>She pauses. \u201cLook, you still have time, okay? I just don\u2019t want you to wait too long and have all the good placements go to other people. I\u2019m just worried about you is all. But everything\u2019s fine; you\u2019re still okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Even just that one little word is an effort.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s everything else?\u201d</p><p>I started out this conversation wishing I could tell her about Peter and everything that\u2019s been going on with me, but now I\u2019m just feeling relieved that there are all these miles between us and she can\u2019t see what I\u2019m up to. \u201cEverything\u2019s good,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Josh? Have you talked to him lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I say. Which I haven\u2019t. I\u2019ve been so busy with Peter I haven\u2019t really had a chance.</p><p>31</p><p>KITTY AND I ARE ON the front steps. She\u2019s drinking her Korean yogurt drink and I\u2019m working on that scarf for Margot while I wait for Peter. Kitty\u2019s waiting for Daddy to come out. He\u2019s dropping her off at school today.</p><p>Ms. Rothschild hasn\u2019t come outside yet. Maybe she\u2019s sick today or maybe she\u2019s running even later than usual.</p><p>We\u2019ve got our eyes locked on her front door when a minivan drives down our street and slows in front of our house. I squint my eyes. It\u2019s Peter Kavinsky. Driving a tan minivan. He ducks his head out the window. \u201cAre you coming or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you driving that?\u201d Kitty calls out.</p><p>\u201cNever mind that, Katherine,\u201d Peter calls back. \u201cJust get in.\u201d</p><p>Kitty and I look at each other. \u201cMe too?\u201d Kitty asks me.</p><p>I shrug. Then I lean back and open the front door and yell out, \u201cKitty\u2019s getting a ride with me, Daddy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d he yells back.</p><p>We stand up, but just then Ms. Rothschild comes dashing out of the house in her navy blue suit, briefcase in one hand, coffee in the other. Kitty and I look at each other gleefully. \u201cFive, four, three\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d</p><p>Giggling, we hurl ourselves toward Peter\u2019s minivan. I hop into the passenger seat and Kitty climbs into the back. \u201cWhat were you guys laughing about?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I\u2019m about to tell him when Josh walks out of his house. He stops and stares at us for a second before he waves. I wave back and Kitty hangs her head out the window and yells, \u201cHi, Josh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat up,\u201d Peter calls out, leaning over me.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Josh says back. Then he gets in his car.</p><p>Peter pokes me in the side and grins and puts the car in reverse. \u201cTell me why you guys were laughing.\u201d</p><p>Clicking into my seat belt, I say, \u201cAt least once a week, Ms. Rothschild runs out to her car and spills hot coffee all over herself.\u201d</p><p>Kitty pipes up, \u201cIt\u2019s the funniest thing in the world.\u201d</p><p>Peter snorts. \u201cYou guys are sadistic.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s sadistic?\u201d Kitty wants to know. She puts her head between us.</p><p>I push her back and say, \u201cPut your seat belt on.\u201d</p><p>Peter puts the car in reverse. \u201cIt means seeing other people in pain makes you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She repeats it to herself softly. \u201cSadistic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t teach her weird stuff,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI like weird stuff,\u201d Kitty protests.</p><p>Peter says, \u201cSee? The kid likes weird stuff.\u201d Without turning around, he lifts his hand up for a high five and Kitty leans forward and slaps it heartily. \u201cHey, gimme a sip of whatever it is you\u2019re drinking back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost gone, so you can have the rest,\u201d she says.</p><p>Kitty hands it over, and Peter tips back the plastic container in his mouth. \u201cThis is good,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s from the Korean grocery store,\u201d Kitty tells him. \u201cThey come in a pack and you can put them in the freezer and if you pack it for lunch, it\u2019ll be icy and cold when you drink it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me. Lara Jean, bring me one of these tomorrow morning, will you? For services rendered.\u201d</p><p>I shoot him a dirty look and Peter says, \u201cI mean the rides! Geez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring you one, Peter,\u201d Kitty says.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you give me a ride to school tomorrow, too,\u201d Kitty finishes, and Peter hoots.</p> <p>32</p><p>BEFORE FOURTH PERIOD, I\u2019M AT my locker, trying to repin my milkmaid braid in the little mirror hanging from the door.</p><p>\u201cLara Jean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>I peek around the door and it\u2019s Lucas Krapf, wearing a thin V-neck sweater in brilliant blue and stone-colored khakis. \u201cI\u2019ve had this for a while now . . . I wasn\u2019t going to say anything, but then I thought maybe you\u2019d want it back.\u201d He puts a pink envelope in my hand. It\u2019s my letter. So Lucas got his, too.</p><p>I drop it into my locker, make a yikes face at myself in the mirror, and then close the door. \u201cSo you\u2019re probably wondering what this is all about,\u201d I begin. And then I immediately falter. \u201cIt\u2019s um, well, I wrote it a long time ago, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You\u2019re not curious?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. It was just really nice to get a letter like that. I was actually pretty honored.\u201d</p><p>I let out a relieved sigh and sag against my locker. Why is Lucas Krapf just so exactly right? He knows how to say the perfect thing.</p><p>And then Lucas gives me a half grimace, half smile. \u201cBut the thing is . . .\u201d He lowers his voice. \u201cYou know I\u2019m gay, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right, totally,\u201d I say, trying not to sound disappointed. \u201cNo, I totally knew.\u201d So Peter was right after all.</p><p>Lucas smiles. \u201cYou\u2019re so cute,\u201d he says, and I perk up again. Then he says, \u201cListen, can you not tell anybody, though? I mean, I\u2019m out, but I\u2019m not out out yet. You know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally,\u201d I say, super confident.</p><p>\u201cFor instance, my mom knows but my dad only kind of knows. I haven\u2019t outright told him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just let people believe what they please. I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s my responsibility to quantify myself for them. I mean, you get what I\u2019m talking about. As a biracial person, I\u2019m sure people are always asking you what race you are, right?\u201d</p><p>I haven\u2019t thought of it that way before, but yes yes yes! Lucas just gets it. \u201cExactly. It\u2019s like, why do you need to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>We smile at each other and I feel that wonderful sensation of being known by someone. We walk together in the same direction; he has Mandarin class and I have French. At one point he asks me about Peter, and I\u2019m tempted to tell him the truth, because I\u2019m feeling so close to him. But Peter and I made that pact: we explicitly said we would never tell anyone. I don\u2019t want to be the one to break it. So when Lucas says, \u201cHey, so what\u2019s the deal with you and Kavinsky?\u201d I just shrug and give him an enigmatic smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s crazy, right? Because he\u2019s so . . .\u201d I search for the exact right word, but I can\u2019t think of it. \u201cI mean, he could play the part of a handsome guy in a movie.\u201d Hastily I add, \u201cSo could you, though. You\u2019d play the guy the girl should pick.\u201d</p><p>Lucas laughs, but I can tell he likes it.</p><p>Dear Lucas,</p><p>I never met a boy with manners as good as yours. You ought to have a British accent. At homecoming, you wore a cravat and it suited you so well I think you could wear one all the time and get away with it.</p><p>Oh, Lucas! I wish I knew what kind of girls you liked. As far as I can tell, you haven\u2019t dated anyone . . . unless you have a girlfriend at another school. You\u2019re just so mysterious. I hardly know a thing about you. The things I know are so unsubstantial, so unsatisfying, like that you eat a chicken sandwich every day at lunch, and you\u2019re on the golf team. I guess the one remotely real thing I know about you is you\u2019re a good writer, which must mean you have deep reserves of emotion. Like that short story you wrote in creative writing about the poisoned well, and it was from a six-year-old boy\u2019s perspective. It was so sensitive, so keen! That story made me feel like I knew you at least a little bit. But I don\u2019t know you, and I wish I did.</p><p>I think you\u2019re very special. I think you are probably one of the most special people at our school, and I wish more people knew that about you. Or maybe I don\u2019t, because sometimes it\u2019s nice to be the only one who knows something.</p><p>Love, Lara Jean</p><p>33</p><p>AFTER SCHOOL, CHRIS AND I are hanging out in my room. She\u2019s in trouble with her mom for staying out all night, so she\u2019s hiding out over here until her mom leaves for book club. We\u2019re sharing a big bag of Kitty\u2019s Pirate Booty, which I\u2019m going to have to replace because she\u2019ll complain if it\u2019s missing from her lunch on Monday.</p><p>Chris stuffs a handful of Pirate Booty puffs in her mouth. \u201cJust tell me, Lara Jean. How far have you guys gone?\u201d</p><p>I almost choke. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone nowhere! And we have no plans to go anywhere in the near future.\u201d Or ever.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? Not even over-the-bra action? A quick swipe across your chest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I told you, me and my sister aren\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>Chris snorts. \u201cAre you joking me? Of course Margot and Josh have had sex. Quit being so naive, Lara Jean.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t me being naive,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI know for a fact that he and Margot haven\u2019t done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? How do you know \u2018for a fact\u2019? I\u2019d love to hear this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you.\u201d</p><p>If I tell Chris, she\u2019ll only laugh more. She doesn\u2019t understand; she only has a little brother. She doesn\u2019t know how it is with sisters. Margot and I, we made a pact, back in middle school. We swore we wouldn\u2019t have sex until we were married or we were really, really in love and at least twenty-one. Margot might be really, really in love, but she\u2019s not married and she\u2019s not twenty-one. She\u2019d never go back on her word. With sisters a pact is everything.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019d really love to know.\u201d Chris has that hungry glint in her eyes, and I know she\u2019s just getting warmed up.</p><p>\u201cYou just want to make fun of it, and I\u2019m not going to let you,\u201d I say.</p><p>Chris rolls her eyes. \u201cFine. But there\u2019s no way they haven\u2019t boned.\u201d</p><p>I think Chris talks like that on purpose to get a reaction from me. She loves a reaction, so I\u2019m careful to not give her one. I calmly say, \u201cCan you please stop talking about my sister and Josh having sex. You know I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>Chris takes a permanent marker out of her bag and starts to color in her thumbnail. \u201cYou need to stop being such a scaredy-cat. Seriously, you\u2019ve built it up in your head to be this huge, life-changing moment, but it\u2019s actually done in under five, and it\u2019s not even the best part.\u201d</p> <p>I know she\u2019s waiting for me to ask what the best part is, and I am curious, but I ignore her and say, \u201cI think permanent marker is toxic for your nails,\u201d to which she shakes her head at me like I\u2019m a lost cause.</p><p>I wonder, though . . . what would it be like? To be that close to a boy and have him see all of you, no holding back. Would it be scary only for a second or two, or would it be scary the whole time? What if I didn\u2019t like it at all? Or what if I liked it too much? It\u2019s a lot to think about.</p><p>34</p><p>\u201cDO YOU THINK IF A guy and a girl have been dating for a long time, they\u2019ve automatically had sex?\u201d I ask Peter. We\u2019re sitting on the floor of the library, our backs against the wall of the reference section nobody ever goes to. It\u2019s after school, the library\u2019s empty, and we\u2019re doing homework. Peter gets Cs and Ds in chemistry, so I\u2019ve been helping him study.</p><p>Peter looks up from his chem book, suddenly interested. He tosses the book aside and says, \u201cI need more information. How long have they been dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA long time. Like two years, something like that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow old are they? Our age?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen most likely but not necessarily. It depends on the girl and the guy. But if I had to put money on it, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the girl\u2019s not like that. The guy isn\u2019t either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are we talking about here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a secret.\u201d I hesitate, and then say, \u201cChris thinks there\u2019s no way they haven\u2019t. She says it\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>Peter snorts. \u201cWhy are you going to her for advice? That girl is a train wreck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is not a train wreck!\u201d</p> <p>He gives me a look. \u201cFreshman year she got wasted on Four Loko and she climbed up on Tyler Boylan\u2019s roof and did a striptease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you there?\u201d I demand. \u201cDid you see it with your own two eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight. Fished her clothes out of the pool like the gentleman I am.\u201d</p><p>I blow out my cheeks. \u201cWell, Chris never mentioned that story to me, so I can\u2019t really speak to that. Besides, didn\u2019t they ban Four Loko or whatever it\u2019s called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey still make it, but a shitty watered-down version. You can dump Five-Hour Energy in it to get the same effect.\u201d I shudder, which makes Peter smile. \u201cWhat do you and Chris even talk about?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou have nothing in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we talk about?\u201d I counter.</p><p>Peter laughs. \u201cPoint taken.\u201d He pushes away from the wall and puts his head in my lap, and I go completely still.</p><p>I try to make my voice sound normal as I say, \u201cYou\u2019re in a really strange mood today.\u201d</p><p>He raises an eyebrow at me. \u201cWhat kind of mood am I in?\u201d Peter sure loves to hear about himself. Normally, I don\u2019t mind, but today I\u2019m not in the mood to oblige him. He already has too many people in his life telling him how great he is.</p><p>\u201cThe obnoxious kind,\u201d I say, and he laughs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sleepy.\u201d He closes his eyes and snuggles against me. \u201cTell me a bedtime story, Covey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t flirt,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>His eyes fly open. \u201cI wasn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you were. You flirt with everyone. It\u2019s like you can\u2019t help yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t ever flirt with you.\u201d Peter sits back up and checks his phone, and suddenly I\u2019m wishing I didn\u2019t say anything at all.</p><p>35</p><p>I\u2019M IN FRENCH CLASS, LOOKING out the window as I am wont to do, and that\u2019s when I see Josh walking toward the bleachers by the track. He\u2019s carrying his lunch, and he\u2019s alone. Why is he eating alone? He has his comic-book group; he has Jersey Mike.</p><p>But I guess he and Jersey Mike didn\u2019t hang out so much last year. Josh was always with Margot and me. The trio. And now we\u2019re not even a duo, and he\u2019s all alone. Part of it\u2019s Margot\u2019s fault for leaving, but I can see my part in it too\u2014if I\u2019d never started liking him, I wouldn\u2019t have had to make up this whole Peter K. story. I could just be his good friend Lara Jean like always.</p><p>Maybe this is why Mommy told Margot not to go to college with a boyfriend. When you have a boyfriend or a girlfriend, you only want to be with that person, and you forget about everybody else, and then when the two of you break up, you\u2019ve lost all your friends. They were off doing fun stuff without you.</p><p>All I can say is, Josh sure is a lonely figure eating his sandwich on the very top bleacher.</p><p>I take the bus home from school because Peter had to leave early for a lacrosse game with his club team. I\u2019m in front of the house, taking the mail out of our mailbox, when Josh pulls into his driveway. \u201cHey!\u201d he calls out. He climbs out of his car and jogs over to me, his backpack slung over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI saw you on the bus,\u201d he says. \u201cI waved, but you were doing your daydreaming thing. So how long\u2019s your car going to be in the shop?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It keeps changing. They had to order a part from, like, Indiana.\u201d</p><p>Josh gives me a knowing look. \u201cSo you\u2019re secretly relieved, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Why would I be relieved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. I know you. You hate driving. You\u2019re probably glad to have the excuse not to drive.\u201d</p> <p>I start to protest, but then I stop. There\u2019s no use. Josh knows me too well. \u201cWell, maybe I\u2019m a teeny-tiny bit relieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you ever need a ride, you know you can call me.\u201d</p><p>I nod. I do know that. I wouldn\u2019t call him for myself, but I would for Kitty, in an emergency.</p><p>\u201cI mean, I know you have Kavinsky now, but I\u2019m right next door. It\u2019s way more convenient for me to give you a ride to school than him. I mean, it\u2019s more environmentally responsible.\u201d I don\u2019t say anything, and Josh scratches the back of his neck. \u201cI want to say something to you, but I feel weird bringing it up. Which is also weird, because we\u2019ve always been able to talk to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can still talk to each other,\u201d I say. \u201cNothing\u2019s changed.\u201d That\u2019s the biggest lie I\u2019ve ever told him, even bigger than the lie about my so-called dead twin Marcella. Until a couple of years ago Josh thought I had a twin sister named Marcella who died of leukemia.</p> <p>\u201cOkay. I feel like . . . I feel like you\u2019ve been avoiding me ever since . . .\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s going to say it. He\u2019s actually going to say it. I look down at the ground.</p><p>\u201cEver since Margot broke up with me.\u201d</p><p>My head snaps up. That\u2019s what he thinks? That I\u2019m avoiding him because of Margot? Did my letter really make that little of an impact? I try to keep my face still and expressionless when I say, \u201cI haven\u2019t been avoiding you. I\u2019ve just been busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Kavinsky. I know. You and I have known each other a long time. You\u2019re one of my best friends, Lara Jean. I don\u2019t want to lose you, too.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the \u201ctoo\u201d that\u2019s the sticking point. The \u201ctoo\u201d is what stops me in my tracks. It sticks in my craw. Because if he hadn\u2019t said \u201ctoo,\u201d it would be about me and him. Not about me and him and Margot.</p> <p>\u201cThat letter you wrote\u2014\u201d</p><p>Too late. I don\u2019t want to talk about the letter anymore. Before he can say another word, I say, \u201cI\u2019ll always be your friend, Joshy.\u201d And then I smile at him, and it takes a lot of effort. It takes so much effort. But if I don\u2019t smile, I\u2019ll cry.</p><p>Josh nods. \u201cOkay. Good. So . . . so can we hang out again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Josh reaches out and chucks my chin. \u201cSo can I give you a ride to school tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say. Because wasn\u2019t that kind of the whole point of this? To be able to hang out with Josh again without that letter hanging over our heads? To just be his good friend Lara Jean again?</p><p>After dinner I teach Kitty how to do laundry. She resists me at first, but I tell her that this is a job we are all sharing from now on, so she\u2019d better just accept it.</p><p>\u201cWhen the buzzer goes off, that means it\u2019s done and you have to fold it right away or it\u2019ll get wrinkled.\u201d</p> <p>To both of our surprise, Kitty likes doing laundry. Mostly because she can sit in front of the TV and fold and watch her shows in peace.</p><p>\u201cNext time I\u2019ll teach you how to iron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIroning, too? Who am I, Cinderella?\u201d</p><p>I ignore her. \u201cYou\u2019ll be good at ironing. You like precision and clean lines. You\u2019ll probably be better at it than me.\u201d</p><p>This piques her interest. \u201cYeah, maybe. Your stuff always looks wrinkled no matter what.\u201d</p><p>After we finish the laundry, Kitty and I are washing up in the bathroom we share. There are two sinks; Margot had the one on the left and Kitty and I used to fight over who the sink on the right belonged to. It\u2019s hers now.</p><p>Kitty\u2019s brushing her teeth and I\u2019m putting on a cucumber-aloe face mask, when Kitty says to me, \u201cDo you think if I asked, Peter would take us to McDonald\u2019s tomorrow on the way to school?\u201d</p><p>I rub another dollop of green face mask onto my cheeks. \u201cI don\u2019t want you getting used to Peter giving us rides. You\u2019re taking the bus from now on, okay?\u201d</p><p>Kitty pouts. \u201cWhy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause. Besides, Peter\u2019s not giving me a ride tomorrow, Josh is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut won\u2019t Peter be mad?\u201d</p><p>My face is getting tight from the mask drying. Through clenched teeth I say, \u201cNah. He\u2019s not the jealous type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who\u2019s the jealous type?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have a good answer for that. Who is the jealous type? I\u2019m mulling this over when Kitty giggles at me in the mirror and says, \u201cYou look like a zombie.\u201d</p><p>I hold my hands out to her face and she ducks away. In my best zombie voice I say, \u201cI want to eat your brains.\u201d</p><p>Kitty runs away, screaming.</p><p>When I\u2019m back in my room, I text Peter that I don\u2019t need a ride to school tomorrow. I don\u2019t tell him Josh is giving me a ride. Just in case.</p><p>36</p><p>TODAY\u2019S NOTE FROM PETER SAYS, Tart and Tangy after school?</p><p>He\u2019s drawn two boxes, a yes or a no. I check yes and drop the note in his locker.</p><p>After school ends, I meet Peter at his car, and we caravan with his lacrosse friends to Tart and Tangy. I order an original frozen yogurt with Cap\u2019n Crunch and strawberries and kiwi and pineapple, and Peter gets key lime with crushed-up Oreos. I pull out my wallet to pay for my yogurt, but Peter stops me. He winks at me and says, \u201cI got this.\u201d</p><p>I whisper, \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t ever paying for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy boys are here. I can\u2019t look like a cheap-ass in front of my boys.\u201d Then he puts his arm around me and says loudly, \u201cFor as long as you\u2019re my girl, you don\u2019t pay for frozen yogurt.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes, but I\u2019m not going to say no to a free frozen yogurt. No boy has ever paid for me before. I could get used to this kind of nice treatment.</p><p>I was bracing myself to see Genevieve here, but she doesn\u2019t show. I think Peter\u2019s wondering too, because he keeps his eyes on the door. With Genevieve, I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. So far she\u2019s been eerily, disturbingly quiet. She\u2019s hardly ever in the cafeteria during lunch because she and Emily Nussbaum have been eating off campus, and when I see her in the hallways, she fake smiles at me without showing her teeth, which is somehow more menacing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When is she going to strike back against me? When will I have my Jamila Singh moment? Chris says Genevieve\u2019s too obsessed with her college boyfriend to care about me and Peter, but I don\u2019t believe it. I\u2019ve seen the way she looks at him. Like he\u2019s hers.</p><p>The boys put a few tables together and we basically take over the place. It\u2019s just like at the lunch table, with them being loud, talking about the football game coming up on Friday. I don\u2019t think I say two words. I don\u2019t really have anything to add. I just eat my free frozen yogurt and enjoy the fact that I\u2019m not at home organizing my shoe closet or watching the Golf Channel with my dad.</p><p>We\u2019re walking to our cars when Gabe says, \u201cHey, Lara Jean, did you know that if you say your name really fast, it sounds like Large? Try it! Larajean.\u201d</p><p>Dutifully I repeat, \u201cLarajean. Larjean. Largy. Actually I think it sounds more like Largy, not Large.\u201d</p> <p>Gabe nods to himself and announces, \u201cI\u2019m going to start calling you Large. You\u2019re so little it\u2019s funny. Right? Like those big guys who go by the name Tiny?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Gabe turns to Darrell. \u201cShe\u2019s so little she could be our mascot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not that small,\u201d I protest.</p><p>\u201cHow tall are you?\u201d Darrell asks me.</p> <p>\u201cFive two,\u201d I fib. It\u2019s more like five one and a quarter.</p><p>Tossing his spoon in the trash, Gabe says, \u201cYou\u2019re so little you could fit in my pocket!\u201d All the guys laugh. Peter\u2019s smiling in a bemused way. Then Gabe suddenly grabs me and throws me over his shoulder like I\u2019m a kid and he\u2019s my dad.</p><p>\u201cGabe! Put me down!\u201d I shriek, kicking my legs and pounding on his chest.</p><p>He starts spinning around in a circle, and all the guys are cracking up. \u201cI\u2019m going to adopt you, Large! You\u2019re going to be my pet. I\u2019ll put you in my old hamster cage!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m giggling so hard I can\u2019t catch my breath and I\u2019m starting to feel dizzy. \u201cPut me down!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut her down, man,\u201d Peter says, but he\u2019s laughing too.</p> <p>Gabe runs toward somebody\u2019s pickup truck and sets me down in the back. \u201cGet me out of here!\u201d I yell. Gabe\u2019s already running away. All the guys start getting into their cars. \u201cBye, Large!\u201d they call out. Peter jogs over to me and extends his hand so I can hop down.</p><p>\u201cYour friends are crazy,\u201d I say, jumping onto the pavement.</p><p>\u201cThey like you,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. They used to hate when I would bring Gen places. They don\u2019t mind if you hang out with us.\u201d Peter slings his arm around me. \u201cCome on, Large. I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><p>As we walk to his car, I let my hair fall in my face so he doesn\u2019t see me smiling. It sure is nice being part of a group, feeling like I belong.</p><p>37</p><p>I VOLUNTEERED TO BAKE SIX dozen cup cakes for Kitty\u2019s PTA bake sale. I did it because Margot\u2019s done it for the past two years. Margot only ever did it because she didn\u2019t want people to think Kitty\u2019s family wasn\u2019t involved enough in PTA. She did brownies both times, but I signed up for cupcakes because I thought they\u2019d be a bigger hit. I bought a few different kinds of blue sprinkles and I made little toothpick flags that say BLUE MOUNTAIN ACADEMY. I thought Kitty would have fun helping me decorate.</p> <p>But now I\u2019m realizing Margot\u2019s way was better, because with brownies, you just pour them in the pan, bake, and slice, and there you go. Cupcakes are a lot more work. You have to scoop the perfect amount six dozen times, and then you have to wait for them to cool, and then you\u2019re frosting and sprinkling.</p><p>I\u2019m measuring out my eighth cup of flour when the doorbell rings. \u201cKitty!\u201d I scream. \u201cGet the door!\u201d</p><p>It rings again. \u201cKitty!\u201d</p><p>From upstairs she screams back, \u201cI\u2019m running an important experiment!\u201d</p><p>I run to the door and fling it open without bothering to check who it is.</p><p>Peter. He busts up laughing.</p><p>\u201cYou have flour all over your face,\u201d he says, dusting off my cheeks with the backs of his hands.</p><p>I twist away from him and wipe my face with my apron. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to the game. Didn\u2019t you read my note from yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shoot. I had a test and I forgot.\u201d Peter frowns and I add, \u201cI can\u2019t go anyway because I have to bake seventy-two cupcakes by tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn a Friday night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this for the PTA bake sale?\u201d Peter brushes past me and starts taking off his sneakers. \u201cYou guys are a no-shoes house, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, surprised. \u201cIs your mom making something too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRice Krispie treats.\u201d Another way smarter choice than seventy-two cupcakes.</p><p>\u201cSorry you came over here for nothing. Maybe we can go to the game next Friday,\u201d I say, expecting him to put his shoes back on.</p><p>But he doesn\u2019t, he wanders into the kitchen and sits on a stool. Huh? \u201cYour house looks the same as I remembered,\u201d he says, looking around. He points at the framed picture of me and Margot taking a bath when we were babies. \u201cCute.\u201d</p><p>I can feel my cheeks burn. I go and turn the photo over. \u201cWhen have you ever been to my house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack in seventh grade. Remember how we\u2019d hang out in your neighbor\u2019s tree house? I had to pee once and you let me use your bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d I say.</p><p>It\u2019s funny to see a boy other than Josh in our kitchen. I feel nervous for some reason. \u201cHow long\u2019s it going to take?\u201d he asks me, his hands in his pockets.</p><p>\u201cHours, probably.\u201d I pick up the measuring cup again. I can\u2019t remember what cup I was on.</p><p>Peter groans. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we just go to the store and buy some?\u201d</p><p>I start measuring the flour that\u2019s in the bowl, separating it into piles. \u201cBecause, do you think any of the other moms are buying cupcakes from Food Lion? How would that make Kitty look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if it\u2019s for Kitty, then Kitty should be helping.\u201d Peter hops off the stool and comes up to me and slides his hands around my waist and tries to untie my apron strings. \u201cWhere is the kid?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. \u201cWhat . . . are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Peter looks at me like I\u2019m a dummy. \u201cI need an apron too if I\u2019m going to help. I\u2019m not trying to get my clothes all messed up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be done in time for the game,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll just go to the party after.\u201d Peter shoots me an incredulous look. \u201cThat was in the note I wrote you today! God, why do I even bother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was really busy today,\u201d I say meekly. I feel bad. He\u2019s following through on his end of the deal and faithfully writing me a note a day and I can\u2019t even be bothered to read them. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can go to a party. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m allowed to go out that late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your dad home? I\u2019ll ask him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s at the hospital.

Maybe late.\u201d Or maybe like in the next hour. But Peter will be long gone by then. \u201cYou should just go. I don\u2019t want to hold you up.\u201d</p><p>Peter groans. \u201cCovey. I need you. Gen hasn\u2019t said a word about us yet, which is kind of the whole point of this. And . . . she might bring that dickhole she\u2019s dating.\u201d Peter pushes out his lower lip. \u201cCome on. I came through for you with Josh, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I admit. \u201cBut, Peter, I have to make these cupcakes for the bake sale\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Peter stretches his arms out. \u201cThen I\u2019ll help you. Just give me an apron.\u201d</p><p>I back away from him and start rummaging around for another apron. I find one with a cupcake print and hand it to him.</p><p>He makes a face and points at mine. \u201cI want the one you\u2019re wearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s mine!\u201d It\u2019s red-and-white gingham with little brown bears; my grandma got it for me in Korea. \u201cI always bake in this. Just wear that one.\u201d</p><p>Slowly Peter shakes his head and holds out his hand. \u201cGive me yours. You owe me for not reading any of my notes.\u201d</p><p>I untie the apron and hand it over. I turn around and go back to my measuring. \u201cYou\u2019re a bigger baby than Kitty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust hurry up and give me a task.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you qualified, though? Because I only have exactly enough ingredients for six dozen cupcakes. I don\u2019t want to have to start over\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how to bake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. Dump those sticks of butter into the mixing bowl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then when you\u2019re done, I\u2019ll give you your next task.\u201d</p><p>Peter rolls his eyes but he does as he\u2019s told. \u201cSo this is what you do on Friday nights? Stay home and bake in your pj\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do other stuff too,\u201d I say, tying my hair into a tighter ponytail.</p> <p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m still so flustered from Peter\u2019s sudden appearance that I can\u2019t think. \u201cUm, I go out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I don\u2019t know! Quit interrogating me, Peter.\u201d I blow my bangs out of my eyes. It\u2019s getting really warm in here. I might as well just turn off the oven, because Peter\u2019s arrival has slowed down this whole process. At this rate I\u2019ll be up all night. \u201cYou made me lose my count on the flour. I\u2019m going to have to start over from scratch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, let me do it,\u201d Peter says, coming up close behind me.</p><p>I jerk away from him. \u201cNo no, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d I say, and he shakes his head and tries to take the measuring cup from me, but I won\u2019t let go, and flour poufs out of the cup and into the air. It dusts us both. Peter starts cracking up and I let out an outraged shriek. \u201cPeter!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s laughing too hard to speak.</p><p>I cross my arms. \u201cI\u2019d better still have enough flour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like a grandma,\u201d he says, still laughing.</p><p>\u201cWell, you look like a grandpa,\u201d I counter. I dump the flour in my mixing bowl back into the flour canister.</p><p>\u201cActually, you\u2019re really a lot like my granny,\u201d Peter says. \u201cYou hate cussing. You like to bake. You stay at home on Friday nights. Wow, I\u2019m dating my granny. Gross.\u201d</p><p>I start measuring again. One, two. \u201cI don\u2019t stay home every Friday night.\u201d Three.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you out. You don\u2019t go to parties. We used to hang out back in the day. Why\u2019d you stop hanging out?\u201d</p><p>Four. \u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know. Middle school was different.\u201d What does he want me to say? That Genevieve decided I wasn\u2019t cool enough so I got left behind? Why is he so clueless?</p><p>\u201cI always wondered why you stopped hanging out with us.\u201d</p><p>Was I on five or six? \u201cPeter! You made me lose my count again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have that effect on women.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes at him and he grins back at me, but before he can say anything else, I yell, \u201cKitty! Get down here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter\u2019s here!\u201d I know that will get her.</p><p>In five seconds flat, Kitty\u2019s running into the kitchen. She skids to a stop, all of a sudden shy. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d she asks him.</p><p>\u201cTo pick up Lara Jean. Why aren\u2019t you helping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was running an experiment. Wanna help me?\u201d</p><p>I answer for him. \u201cSure, he\u2019ll help you.\u201d To Peter I say, \u201cYou\u2019re distracting me. Go help Kitty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you want my help, Katherine. See, I\u2019m really distracting to women. I make them lose their count.\u201d Peter winks at her and I make a gagging sound. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay down here and help us bake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBo-ring!\u201d Kitty turns tail and runs back up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare try to sprinkle or frost when it\u2019s all over!\u201d I yell. \u201cYou haven\u2019t earned the right!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m creaming the butter and Peter\u2019s cracking eggs into a chipped salad bowl when my dad gets home. \u201cWhose car is that out front?\u201d Daddy asks as he walks into the kitchen. He stops short. \u201cHello,\u201d he says, surprised. He has a Chan\u2019s Chinese Bistro bag in his hands.</p><p>\u201cHey, Daddy,\u201d I say, like it\u2019s perfectly normal that Peter Kavinsky is cooking in our kitchen. \u201cYou look tired.\u201d</p><p>Peter stands up straighter. \u201cHi, Dr. Covey.\u201d</p><p>My dad sets the bag down on the kitchen table. \u201cOh, hello,\u201d he says, clearing his throat. \u201cNice to see you. You\u2019re Peter K., right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the old gang,\u201d my dad says jovially, and I cringe. \u201cWhat are you kids up to tonight?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m baking cupcakes for Kitty\u2019s PTA bake sale and Peter\u2019s helping,\u201d I say.</p><p>My dad nods. \u201cAre you hungry, Peter? I have plenty.\u201d He lifts the bag. \u201cShrimp lo mein, kung pao chicken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Lara Jean and I were going to stop by our friend\u2019s party,\u201d Peter says. \u201cIf that would be okay? I\u2019ll bring her back early.\u201d</p><p>Before my dad can answer, I say to Peter, \u201cI told you I have to finish these cupcakes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKitty and I will finish them,\u201d my dad interjects. \u201cYou two go to that birthday party.\u201d</p><p>My stomach flips. \u201cIt\u2019s really okay, Daddy. I have to be the one to do them; I\u2019m decorating them specially.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitty and I will figure it out. You can go get changed. We\u2019ll keep working on these cupcakes.\u201d</p><p>I open and close my mouth like a trout. \u201cAll right, then.\u201d And I don\u2019t make a move, I just stand there, because I\u2019m afraid to leave the two of them alone together.</p><p>Peter smiles at me broadly. \u201cYou heard the man. We\u2019ve got this covered.\u201d</p> <p>I think, Don\u2019t act too confident, because then my dad will think you\u2019re arrogant.</p><p>There are certain outfits you have that make you feel good every time you wear them, and then there are outfits where you wore them too many times in a row because you liked them so much, and now they just feel like garbage. I\u2019m looking at my closet now and everything looks like garbage. My anxiety is only compounded by the fact that I know Gen will be wearing the exact right thing, because she always wears the exact right thing. And I have to be wearing the right thing too. Peter wouldn\u2019t have come by and made such a point of going to this party if it weren\u2019t important to him.</p><p>I pull on my jeans and try on different tops\u2014a frilly peach one that suddenly looks prissy in my eyes, a long fuzzy sweater with a penguin on it that looks too kiddish. I\u2019m stepping into a pair of gray shorts with black suspenders when someone knocks at my door. I freeze and grab a sweater to cover myself up.</p><p>\u201cLara Jean?\u201d It\u2019s Peter.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you almost ready?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlmost! Just\u2014just go downstairs. I\u2019ll be down soon.\u201d</p><p>He lets out an audible sigh. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m gonna see what the kid\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>When I hear his footsteps walking away, I scramble and try a cream polka-dot blouse with the shorts-suspenders ensemble. It\u2019s cute, but is it too cute? Too much? And should I do black tights or black knee socks? Margot said I look Parisian in this outfit. Parisian is a good thing. It\u2019s sophisticated, romantic. I try on a beret, just to see the effect, and I immediately throw it off. Definitely too much.</p><p>I wish Peter hadn\u2019t snuck up on me with this. I need time to plan, to prepare. Though truthfully, if he\u2019d asked me ahead of time, I would have come up with an excuse not to go. It\u2019s one thing to go to Tart and Tangy after school, but a party with all of Peter\u2019s friends, not to mention Genevieve?</p><p>I hop around my room, searching for my over-the-knee socks, then searching for my strawberry lip pot that looks like a strawberry. Gosh, I really need to clean my room. It\u2019s hard to find anything in this mess.</p><p>I run to Margot\u2019s room for her big grandpa cardigan, and I pass Kitty\u2019s open door, where I see Peter and Kitty lying on the floor, working with her lab set. I root through Margot\u2019s sweater drawer, which is now T-shirts and shorts because she\u2019s taken most of her sweaters. No grandpa cardigan. But at the bottom of the drawer there is an envelope. A letter, from Josh.</p><p>I want to open it so badly. I know I shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Carefully, ever so carefully, I take out the letter and unfold it.</p> <p>Dear Margot,</p><p>You say we had to break up because you don\u2019t want to go to college with a boyfriend, and you want your freedom, and you don\u2019t want to be held back. But you know and I know that\u2019s not the real reason. You broke up with me because we had sex and you were scared of getting close to me.</p><p>I stop reading.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe it. Chris was right and I was wrong. Margot and Josh did have sex. It\u2019s like everything I thought I knew is the opposite. I thought I knew exactly who my sister was, but it turns out I don\u2019t know anything.</p><p>I hear Peter calling my name. \u201cLara Jean! Are you ready yet?\u201d</p><p>Hastily I fold the letter up and put it back in the envelope. I put it back in the drawer and slam the drawer shut. \u201cComing!\u201d</p><p>38</p><p>WE\u2019RE STANDING AT THE FRONT door of Steve Bledell\u2019s mansion. Steve\u2019s on the football team; he\u2019s mostly known for having a rich stepdad with his own plane.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Peter asks me.</p><p>I wipe my palms on my shorts. I wish I\u2019d had time to do something better to my hair. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s talk strategy for a second. All you have to do is act like you\u2019re in love with me. That shouldn\u2019t be too hard.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re the vainest boy I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>Peter grins and shrugs. He\u2019s got his hand on the doorknob, but then he stops. \u201cHold on,\u201d he says, and he pulls the hair tie out of my hair and tosses it into the yard.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks better down. Just trust me.\u201d Peter runs his fingers through my hair and fluffs it up, and I swat his hand away. Then he takes his phone out of his back pocket and he snaps a picture of me.</p><p>I give him a puzzled look, and he explains, \u201cIn case Gen checks my phone.\u201d I watch as he sets the picture as his wallpaper.</p><p>\u201cCan we do another one?\u201d I don\u2019t like the way my hair looks.</p><p>\u201cNah, I like it. You look pretty.\u201d He probably only said it so we could hurry up and go inside, but it makes me feel good.</p><p>Walking into this party with Peter Kavinsky, I can\u2019t help but feel a sudden rush of pride. He\u2019s here with me. Or is it that I\u2019m here with him?</p><p>I see her as soon as we walk in\u2014she\u2019s on the couch with her girls; they\u2019re all drinking from red Solo cups. No boyfriend in sight. She raises her eyebrows at me and whispers something to Emily Nussbaum. \u201cHeyyy, Lara Jean,\u201d Emily calls out, crooking her finger at me. \u201cCome sit by us.\u201d</p><p>I start to walk toward them, thinking Peter is next to me, but he\u2019s not. He\u2019s stopped to say hi to someone. I look at him with panicky eyes and he just gestures at me to keep going. He mouths, You\u2019re up.</p><p>Crossing the room alone feels like crossing a continent, with Gen and her friends watching me. \u201cHi, guys,\u201d I say, and my voice comes out high-pitched and little-girlish. There\u2019s no room for me on the couch, so I perch on an armrest like a bird on a telephone wire. I keep my eyes trained on Peter\u2019s back; he is across the room with some guys from the lacrosse team. It must be nice to be him. So at ease, so comfortable with himself, knowing that people are waiting for him, like Peter\u2019s here, now the party can really get started. I look around the room, just to have something to do, and see Gabe and Darrell, and they wave at me very nicely, but they don\u2019t come over. It feels like everyone is waiting and watching, waiting and watching to see what Genevieve will do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wish I hadn\u2019t come.</p><p>Emily leans forward. \u201cWe\u2019re all dying to know . . . what\u2019s the story with you and Kavinsky?\u201d</p><p>I know she\u2019s been commissioned by Gen to ask. Gen\u2019s sipping her drink, casual as can be, but she\u2019s waiting for my answer. Is she drunk yet? I wonder. From everything I\u2019ve heard and know about Gen, she is a mean drunk. Not that I\u2019ve ever personally experienced it, but I\u2019ve heard things. There are stories.</p><p>I wet my lips. \u201cWhatever Peter said . . . I guess that\u2019s the story.\u201d</p> <p>Emily waves this off like whatever Peter says doesn\u2019t really count. \u201cWe want to hear it from you. I mean, it\u2019s just so surprising. How did this even happen?\u201d She leans closer, like we are girlfriends.</p><p>When I hesitate, when my eyes dart toward Genevieve, she smiles and rolls her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you can say, Lara Jean. Peter and I are over. I don\u2019t know if he told you this, but I\u2019m actually the one who broke up with him, so.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cThat\u2019s what he said.\u201d That is not what he said, but it\u2019s what I already knew.</p><p>\u201cSo when did you guys get together?\u201d She tries to sound offhand, but I know my answer is important to her. She\u2019s trying to catch me in something.</p><p>\u201cPretty recently,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cHow recently?\u201d she presses.</p><p>I swallow. \u201cRight before school started,\u201d I tell her. Isn\u2019t that what Peter and I decided the story was going to be?</p><p>Genevieve\u2019s eyes go bright and my heart sinks. I\u2019ve said the wrong thing, but it\u2019s too late. It\u2019s hard not to get caught up in her spell. She\u2019s the kind of person you want to like you. You know she can be cruel; you\u2019ve seen her be cruel. But when her eyes are on you, and she\u2019s paying attention to you, you want it to last. Her beauty is part of it, but there\u2019s something more\u2014something that draws you in. I think it\u2019s her transparency\u2014everything she thinks or feels is written all over her face, and even if it wasn\u2019t, she\u2019d say it anyway, because she says what she thinks, without thinking first.</p><p>I can see why Peter has loved her for so long.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s adorable,\u201d Genevieve says, and then the girls start talking about some concert they\u2019re trying to get tickets for and I just sit there, glad I don\u2019t have to talk anymore, wondering how it\u2019s going with the cupcakes back at home. I hope Daddy isn\u2019t overbaking them. There\u2019s nothing worse than a dry cupcake.</p><p>The girls move on to talking about Halloween costumes, so I get up and go to the bathroom. I come back to find Peter sitting in a wingback leather armchair, drinking a beer and talking to Gabe. There\u2019s nowhere for me to sit; my spot on the couch has been taken. Now what?</p> <p>I stand there for a second and then I go for it: I do what a girl in love with Peter would do. I do what Genevieve would do. I march right in and plop down in his lap like it\u2019s my rightful place.</p><p>Peter yelps in surprise. \u201cHey,\u201d he says, coughing on his beer.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say. Then I tweak him once on the nose like I saw a girl do in a black-and-white movie.</p><p>Peter shifts in his seat and gives me a look like he\u2019s trying not to laugh, and I get nervous\u2014tweaking a boy on the nose is romantic, right? Then, out of the corner of my eye, I see Genevieve glaring at us. She whispers something to Emily and stalks out of the room.</p><p>Success!</p><p>Later I am pouring myself Cherry Coke and I see Genevieve and Peter, talking in the kitchen. She\u2019s speaking to him in a low, urgent voice, and she reaches out and touches his arm. He tries to brush her hand away, but she doesn\u2019t let go.</p><p>I\u2019m so mesmerized I don\u2019t even notice when Lucas Krapf comes up to me, popping the cap off a bottle of Bud Light. \u201cHey, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I\u2019m relieved to see a familiar face.</p> <p>He stands next to me, our backs against the dining room wall. \u201cWhat are they fighting about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho even knows?\u201d I say. I smile a secret smile. Hopefully, it\u2019s about me, and Peter will be happy our plan is finally working.</p><p>Lucas crooks his finger at me so I\u2019ll come closer. He whispers, \u201cFighting isn\u2019t a good sign, Lara Jean. It means you still care.\u201d His breath smells like beer.</p><p>Hmm. Genevieve obviously still cares. Peter must too.</p><p>Lucas pats me on the head fondly. \u201cJust be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say.</p><p>Peter stalks out of the kitchen and says, \u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d He doesn\u2019t wait for me to answer him; he just starts walking, his shoulders stiff.</p><p>I give Lucas a shrug. \u201cSee you on Monday, Lucas!\u201d Then I scurry after Peter.</p><p>He\u2019s still mad; I can tell by the way he jerks the keys into the ignition. \u201cGod, she makes me crazy!\u201d He\u2019s so keyed up energy is vibrating off him in waves. \u201cWhat did you say to her?\u201d</p><p>I shift uncomfortably in my seat. \u201cShe asked me when we got together. I told her just before school started.\u201d</p><p>Peter does a full-body groan. \u201cWe hooked up that first weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . you guys were broken up already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well.\u201d Peter shrugs. \u201cWhatever. What\u2019s done is done.\u201d</p><p>Relieved, I click on my seat belt and kick my shoes off. \u201cWhat were you two fighting about tonight, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. You did a good job, by the way. She\u2019s so jealous it\u2019s killing her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay,\u201d I say. Just as long as she doesn\u2019t kill me.</p><p>We drive through the night in silence. Then I ask, \u201cPeter . . . how did you know you loved Genevieve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Lara Jean. Why do you have to ask those kind of questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a naturally curious person.\u201d I flip down his mirror and start braiding the top of my hair. \u201cAnd maybe the question you should be asking yourself is, why are you so afraid to answer those kinds of questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why won\u2019t you answer the question?\u201d</p><p>Peter goes silent, and I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s not going to answer, but then, after a long pause where my question just hangs in the air, he says, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I ever loved Genevieve. How would I even know what that felt like? I\u2019m seventeen, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeventeen\u2019s not so young. A hundred years ago people got married when they were practically our age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that was before electricity and the Internet. A hundred years ago eighteen-year-old guys were out there fighting wars with bayonets and holding a man\u2019s life in their hands! They lived a lot of life by the time they were our age. What do kids our age know about love and life?\u201d I\u2019ve never heard him talk like this before\u2014like he actually cares about something. I think he\u2019s still all worked up from his fight with Genevieve. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wind my hair into a honey bun and secure it with a ponytail holder. \u201cYou know who you sound like? You sound like my grandpa,\u201d I say. \u201cAlso I think you\u2019re stalling because you don\u2019t want to answer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI answered it, you just didn\u2019t like my answer.\u201d</p><p>We pull up in front of my house. Peter turns off the engine, which is what he does when he wants to talk a little while longer. So I don\u2019t jump out right away, I put my bag in my lap and search for my keys even though the lights are on upstairs. Gosh. To be sitting in the passenger seat of Peter Kavinsky\u2019s black Audi. Isn\u2019t that what every girl has ever wanted, in the history of boys and girls? Not Peter Kavinsky specifically, or yes, maybe Peter Kavinsky specifically.</p><p>Peter leans his head back against the headrest and closes his eyes.</p> <p>I say, \u201cDid you know that when people fight with each other, that means they still really care about each other?\u201d When Peter doesn\u2019t answer, I say, \u201cGenevieve must really have a hold on you.\u201d</p><p>I expect him to deny it, but he doesn\u2019t. Instead he says, \u201cShe does, but I wish she didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to be owned by anyone. Or belong to anyone.\u201d</p><p>Margot would say she belongs to herself. Kitty would say she belongs to no one. And I guess I would say I belong to my sisters and my dad, but that won\u2019t always be true. To belong to someone\u2014I didn\u2019t know it, but now that I think about, it seems like that\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted. To really be somebody\u2019s, and to have them be mine.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why you\u2019re doing this,\u201d I tell him\u2014I\u2019m partly asking but I\u2019m mostly telling. \u201cTo prove you don\u2019t belong to her. Or with her.\u201d I stop. \u201cDo you think there\u2019s a difference? Between belonging with and belonging to, I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. One implies choice; the other doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou must really love her to go to all this trouble.\u201d</p><p>Peter makes a dismissive sound. \u201cYou\u2019re too dreamy-eyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say, even though I know he doesn\u2019t mean it as a compliment. I say it just to bug him.</p><p>I know I\u2019ve succeeded when he says, his face sour, \u201cWhat would you know about love, Lara Jean? You\u2019ve never even had a boyfriend before.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m tempted to make up someone, a boy from camp, from another town, from anywhere. His name is Clint is on the tip of my tongue. But it would be too humiliating, because he\u2019d know I was lying; I already told him I never dated anybody before. And even if I hadn\u2019t, it is far more pathetic to make up a boyfriend than to just admit the truth. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve never had a boyfriend. But plenty of people I know have had boyfriends but they\u2019ve never once been in love. I\u2019ve been in love.\u201d That\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this.</p><p>Peter snorts. \u201cWith who? Josh Sanderson? That tool?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a tool,\u201d I say, frowning at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know him to say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnybody with one eye and half a brain could tell what a tool that guy is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying my sister\u2019s blind and brainless?\u201d I demand. If he says one bad word about my sister, that\u2019s it. This whole thing is off. I don\u2019t need him that badly.</p><p>Peter laughs. \u201cNo. I\u2019m saying you are!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what? I changed my mind. You\u2019ve obviously never loved anyone but yourself.\u201d I try to jerk the passenger door open, but it\u2019s locked.</p><p>\u201cLara Jean, I was just kidding. Come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, wait. First tell me something.\u201d Peter leans back in his seat. \u201cHow come you never dated anybody?\u201d</p> <p>I shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know . . . because nobody ever asked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. I know for a fact that Martinez asked you to homecoming and you said no.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m surprised he knows about that. \u201cWhat is it with you guys all calling each other by your last name?\u201d I ask him. \u201cIt\u2019s so\u2014\u201d I struggle to find the right word. \u201cEffected? Affected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t change the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I said no because I was scared.\u201d I stare out the window and run my finger along the glass, making an M for Martinez.</p><p>\u201cOf Tommy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I like Tommy. It\u2019s not that. It\u2019s scary when it\u2019s real. When it\u2019s not just thinking about a person, but, like, having a real live person in front of you, with, like, expectations. And wants.\u201d I finally look at Peter, and I\u2019m surprised by how hard he\u2019s paying attention; his eyes are intent and focused on me like he\u2019s actually interested in what I\u2019m saying. \u201cEven when I liked a boy so much, loved him even, I would always rather be with my sisters, because that\u2019s where I belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. What about right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now? Well, I don\u2019t like you that way so . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Peter says. \u201cDon\u2019t go falling for me again, okay? I can\u2019t have any more girls in love with me. It\u2019s exhausting.\u201d</p><p>I laugh out loud. \u201cYou\u2019re so full of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding,\u201d he protests, but he\u2019s not. \u201cWhat did you ever see in me anyway?\u201d He grins at me then, cocky again and so sure of his charm.</p><p>\u201cHonestly? I really couldn\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>The grin falters and then rights itself, but now it\u2019s not so certain. \u201cYou said it was because I make people feel special. You . . . you said it was because I was a good dancer and I was science partners with Jeffrey Suttleman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, you really memorized every single word of that letter, huh?\u201d I tease. It gives me a small, mean surge of satisfaction to see Peter\u2019s grin fade completely. That surge is immediately followed by remorse, because now I\u2019ve hurt his feelings for no good reason. What is it in me that wants to hurt Peter Kavinsky\u2019s feelings? To make it better, I quickly add, \u201cNo, it\u2019s true\u2014you really did have something about you then.\u201d</p><p>I guess I made it worse, because he flinches.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what else to say, so I open the car door and climb out. \u201cThanks for the ride, Peter.\u201d</p><p>When I get inside the house, I go look in the kitchen first to check on the cupcakes. They\u2019re packed away in Tupperware and my cupcake carrier. The frosting\u2019s a little messy and the sprinkles are haphazard, but overall they look pretty good. That\u2019s a relief. Kitty won\u2019t be shamed at the PTA bake sale on my account, at least! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>From: Margot Covey</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */</p><p>To: Lara Jean Covey</p> <p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */</p><p>How\u2019s school going so far?

Don\u2019t worry about a thing, I\u2019ve got everything under control here!</p><p>xx</p><p>39</p><p>PETER\u2019S MOM OWNS AN ANTIQUE store called Linden &amp; White in the cobblestoney part of downtown. She sells furniture mostly, but she has jewelry cases too, arranged by decades. My favorite decade is the aughts, which means the 1900s. There\u2019s this one gold heart locket with a tiny diamond chip in the center; it looks like a starburst. It costs four hundred dollars. The store is right next to McCalls bookstore, so I go in sometimes and visit with it. I always expect it to be gone, but then it never is.</p><p>We once bought our mom a gold clover pin from the 1940s for Mother\u2019s Day. Margot and I ran a lemonade stand every Saturday for a month, and we were able to chip in sixteen dollars for it. I remember how proud we were when we presented Daddy with the money, we had it nice and neat in a ziplock bag. At the time I thought we were paying the lion\u2019s share and my dad was only helping out a little. I realize now that the pin cost a lot more than sixteen dollars. I should ask Daddy how much it really cost. But then maybe I don\u2019t want to know. Maybe it\u2019s nicer not knowing. We buried her with it because it was her favorite.</p><p>I\u2019m standing over the case, touching my finger to the glass, when Peter comes out from around back. \u201cHey,\u201d he says, surprised.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Peter gives me a look like I\u2019m a dummy. \u201cMy mom owns the place, remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, duh. I\u2019ve just never seen you here before,\u201d I say. \u201cDo you work here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I had to drop something off for my mom. Now she\u2019s saying I have to go pick up a set of chairs in Huntsburgh tomorrow,\u201d Peter says in a grumbly voice. \u201cIt\u2019s two hours there and back. Annoying.\u201d</p><p>I nod companionably and lean away from the case. I pretend to look at a pink-and-black globe. Actually, Margot would like this. It could be a nice Christmas present for her. I give it a little spin. \u201cHow much is this globe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever it says on the sticker.\u201d Peter rests his elbows on the case and leans forward. \u201cYou should come.\u201d</p><p>I look up at him. \u201cCome where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo pick up the chairs with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just complained about how annoying it\u2019s going to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, alone. If you go, it might be slightly less annoying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. Peter says \u201cyou\u2019re welcome\u201d to everything! It\u2019s like, No, Peter, that was not a genuine thank-you, so you do not need to say you\u2019re welcome.</p><p>\u201cSo are you coming or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on! I\u2019m picking the chairs up from an estate sale. The owner was some kind of shut-in. Stuff has just been sitting there for like fifty years. I bet there\u2019ll be stuff you can look at. You like old stuff, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, surprised that he knows this about me. \u201cActually, I\u2019ve kind of always wanted to go to an estate sale. How did the owner die? Like, how long was it before someone found him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re morbid.\u201d He shudders. \u201cDidn\u2019t know you had that side to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have lots of sides to me,\u201d I tell him. I lean forward. \u201cSo? How did he die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t dead, you weirdo. He\u2019s just old. His family\u2019s sending him to a nursing home.\u201d Peter raises an eyebrow at me. \u201cSo I\u2019ll pick you up tomorrow at seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven? You never said anything about leaving at seven in the morning on a Saturday!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says contritely. \u201cWe have to go early before all the good stuff gets snatched up.\u201d</p><p>That night I pack lunches for Peter and me. I make roast beef sandwiches with cheese and tomato, mayonnaise for me, mustard for Peter. Peter doesn\u2019t like mayonnaise. It\u2019s funny the things you pick up in a fake relationship.</p><p>Kitty zooms into the kitchen and tries to grab a sandwich half. I smack her hand away. \u201cThat\u2019s not for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who\u2019s it for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for my lunch tomorrow. Mine and Peter\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>She climbs onto a stool and watches me wrap the sandwiches in wax paper. Sandwiches look so much prettier wrapped in wax paper than encased in ziplock. Any chance I get, I use wax paper. \u201cI like Peter,\u201d Kitty says. \u201cHe\u2019s a lot different than Josh, but I like him.\u201d</p><p>I look up. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He\u2019s really funny. He jokes around a lot. You must really be in love if you\u2019re making sandwiches for him. When Margot and Josh first became a couple, she made three-cheese macaroni and cheese all the time because that\u2019s his favorite. What\u2019s Peter\u2019s favorite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know. I mean, he likes everything.\u201d</p><p>Kitty gives me the side eye. \u201cIf you\u2019re his girlfriend, you should know what his favorite food is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he doesn\u2019t like mayonnaise,\u201d I offer.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because mayonnaise is gross. Josh hates mayonnaise too.\u201d</p><p>I feel a pang. Josh does hate mayonnaise. \u201cKitty, do you miss Josh?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cI wish he still came over.\u201d A wistful look crosses over her face, and I\u2019m about to give her a hug when she puts her hands on her hips. \u201cJust don\u2019t use all the roast beef, because I need it for my lunch next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we run out, I\u2019ll make tuna salad. Sheesh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee that you do,\u201d Kitty says, and zooms off again.</p><p>\u201cSee that you do\u201d? Where does she get this stuff?</p><p>At seven thirty I\u2019m sitting by the window, waiting for Peter to pull up. I\u2019ve got a brown paper bag with our sandwiches and my camera, in case there\u2019s anything spooky or cool I can take a picture of. I\u2019m picturing a crumbling, gray old mansion like you see in horror movies, with a gate and a murky pond or a maze in the backyard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Peter\u2019s mom\u2019s minivan pulls up at seven forty-five, which is annoying. I could\u2019ve slept a whole hour longer. I run out to the car and hop inside, and before I can say a word, he says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. But look what I brought you.\u201d He passes me a donut in a napkin, still warm. \u201cI stopped and got it special, right when they opened at seven thirty. It\u2019s mocha sugar.\u201d</p><p>I break off a piece and pop it into my mouth. \u201cYum!\u201d</p><p>He gives me a sidelong glance as he pulls out of my driveway. \u201cSo I did the right thing being late, right?\u201d</p><p>I nod, taking a big bite. \u201cYou did the exact right thing,\u201d I say, my mouth full. \u201cHey, do you have any water?\u201d</p> <p>Peter hands me a half-full water bottle and I gulp it down. \u201cThis is the best donut I ever had,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he says. Then he takes one look at me and laughs. \u201cYou have sugar all over your face.\u201d</p><p>I wipe my mouth off with the other side of the napkin.</p><p>\u201cCheeks, too,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d Then it\u2019s quiet, which makes me nervous. \u201cCan I put some music on?\u201d I start pulling out my phone.</p> <p>\u201cActually, do you mind if we just drive in quiet for a while? I can\u2019t have music blaring in my face before my caffeine kicks in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . . sure.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if that means he wants me to be quiet too. I wouldn\u2019t have agreed to come on this little outing if I\u2019d known I would have to be silent.</p><p>Peter has a serene look on his face, like he is a fishing-boat captain and we are floating placidly along in the middle of the sea. Except he isn\u2019t driving slowly; he is driving really fast.</p><p>I stay quiet for all of ten seconds and then say, \u201cWait, were you wanting me to be quiet too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just didn\u2019t want music. You can talk as much as you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d And then I\u2019m quiet, because it\u2019s awkward when someone tells you you can talk as much as you want. \u201cHey, so what\u2019s your favorite food?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s your favorite? Like, your favorite favorite. Is it macaroni and cheese, or um, fried chicken, or steak, or pizza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like all that stuff. Equally.\u201d</p><p>I let out an aggrieved sigh. Why does Peter not get the concept of picking a favorite thing?</p><p>Peter mimics my sigh and laughs. \u201cFine. I like cinnamon toast. That\u2019s my favorite thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCinnamon toast?\u201d I repeat. \u201cYou like cinnamon toast better than crab legs? Better than a cheeseburger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than barbecue?\u201d</p> <p>Peter hesitates. Then he says, \u201cYes! Now quit picking my choice apart. I stand by my choice.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cOkay.\u201d I wait, give him a chance to ask me what my favorite food is, but he doesn\u2019t. So I say, \u201cMy favorite food is cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. All cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just gave me so much shit for not picking,\u201d he begins.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s so hard to pick one kind!\u201d I burst out. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s coconut cake, the kind with white frosting that looks like a snowball\u2014I like that a lot. But then I also like cheesecake, and lemon cake, and carrot cake. Also red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting, and chocolate cake with chocolate ganache frosting.\u201d I pause. \u201cHave you ever had olive-oil cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That sounds weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really, really good. Really moist and delicious. I\u2019ll make it for you.\u201d</p><p>Peter groans. \u201cYou\u2019re making me hungry. I should have gotten a whole bag of those donuts.\u201d</p><p>I open up my brown paper bag and pull out his sandwich. I wrote a P on his in Sharpie so I\u2019d know whose was whose. \u201cDo you want a sandwich?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made that for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, I was making one for myself, too. It would have been rude to just bring one sandwich and eat it in front of you.\u201d</p><p>Peter accepts the sandwich and eats it with the bottom half still wrapped. \u201cThis is good,\u201d he says, nodding. \u201cWhat kind of mustard is this?\u201d</p><p>Pleased, I say, \u201cIt\u2019s beer mustard. My dad orders it from some fancy food catalog. My dad\u2019s really into cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to eat yours, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saving it for later,\u201d I say.</p><p>Halfway into the ride, Peter starts weaving in and out of traffic, and he keeps looking at the clock on the dashboard.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we in such a hurry?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cThe Epsteins,\u201d he says, rapping his fingers on the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cWho are the Epsteins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re an old married couple with an antiques store in Charlottesville. Last time, Phil got there five minutes before me and cleared the whole place out. That\u2019s not gonna happen today.\u201d</p><p>Impressed, I say, \u201cWow, I had no idea this business was so cutthroat.\u201d</p><p>Like a know-it-all Peter smirks and goes, \u201cIsn\u2019t all business?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes at the window. Peter\u2019s so Peter.</p><p>We\u2019re at a stoplight when Peter suddenly sits up straight and says, \u201cOh, shit! The Epsteins!\u201d</p><p>I was halfway asleep. My eyes fly open and I yell, \u201cWhere? Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed SUV! Two cars ahead on the right.\u201d I crane my neck to look. They are a gray-haired couple, maybe in their sixties or seventies. It\u2019s hard to tell from this far away.</p><p>As soon as the light turns green, Peter guns it and drives up on the shoulder. I scream out, \u201cGo go go!\u201d and then we\u2019re flying past the Epsteins. My heart is racing out of control, I can\u2019t help but lean my head out the window and scream because it\u2019s such a thrill. My hair whips in the wind and I know it\u2019s going to be a tangled mess, but I couldn\u2019t care less. \u201cYahhh!\u201d I scream.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy,\u201d Peter says, pulling me back in by the hem of my shirt. He\u2019s looking at me like he did that day I kissed him in the hallway. Like I\u2019m different than he thought.</p><p>We pull up to the house and there are already a few cars parked in front. I\u2019m craning my head trying to get a good look. I was expecting a mansion with a wrought iron gate and maybe a gargoyle or two, but this just looks like a normal house. I must look disappointed, because as he puts the car in park, Peter says to me, \u201cDon\u2019t judge an estate sale by the house. I\u2019ve seen all kinds of treasures at regular houses and junk at fancy houses.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hop out and bend down to tie my shoelace. \u201cHurry, Lara Jean! The Epsteins will be here any second!\u201d Peter grabs my hand and we run up the driveway; I am breathing hard trying to keep up with him. His legs are so much longer than mine.</p><p>As soon as we are inside, Peter goes right up to a man in a suit and I bend over and try to catch my breath. A few people are milling around looking at the furniture. There\u2019s a long dining room table in the center of the room with china and milk glass and porcelain knickknacks. I go up to it and take a closer look. I like a little white creamer with pink rosebuds but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m allowed to touch it and see how much it costs. It could be really expensive.</p><p>There\u2019s a big basket with olden-day Christmas memorabilia in it, plastic Santas and Rudolphs and glass ornaments. I\u2019m sifting through it when Peter comes up to me, a huge grin on his face. \u201cMission accomplished,\u201d he says. He nods at an older couple who are looking at a wooden sideboard. \u201cThe Epsteins,\u201d he whispers to me.</p><p>\u201cDid you get the chairs?\u201d Mr. Epstein calls out. He\u2019s trying to sound casual and not annoyed, but his hands are on his hips and he\u2019s standing very rigidly.</p> <p>\u201cYou know it,\u201d Peter calls back. \u201cBetter luck next time.\u201d To me he says, \u201cDo you see anything cool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of stuff.\u201d I hold up a hot pink reindeer. It\u2019s glass, with an electric blue nose. \u201cThis would look great on my vanity. Will you ask the man how much it costs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you can. It\u2019ll be good for you to learn how to negotiate.\u201d Peter grabs my hand and leads me over to the man in the suit. He\u2019s filling out some paperwork on a clipboard. He looks very busy and important. I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019m supposed to be here. I\u2019m thinking I don\u2019t really need this reindeer.</p><p>But Peter\u2019s looking at me expectantly, so I clear my throat and say, \u201cExcuse me, sir, but how much is this reindeer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s part of a lot,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cOh. Um, I\u2019m sorry but what\u2019s a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means it\u2019s part of a set,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou have to buy the whole set of ornaments. Seventy-five dollars. They\u2019re vintage, you see.\u201d</p><p>I start to back away. \u201cThank you anyway,\u201d I say.</p><p>Peter pulls me back and gives him a winning smile and says, \u201cCan\u2019t you just throw it in with the chairs? A gift with purchase?\u201d</p><p>The man sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t want to separate them.\u201d He turns away to flip through his clipboard.</p><p>Peter throws me a look, like You\u2019re the one who wants the reindeer; you should step up. I give him back a look that says I don\u2019t want it that bad, and Peter shakes his head firmly and pushes me toward the man. I say, \u201cPlease, sir? I\u2019ll give you ten dollars for it. No one will know they\u2019re missing a reindeer. And look, his paw is a little chipped on the bottom, see?\u201d I hold it up.</p> <p>\u201cAll right, all right. Just take it,\u201d the man says begrudgingly, and I beam at him and start to pull my wallet out of my purse, but he waves me off.</p><p>\u201cThank you! Thank you so much.\u201d I clutch the reindeer to my chest. Maybe haggling isn\u2019t as hard as I thought.</p><p>Peter winks at me, and then he says to the man, \u201cI\u2019ll bring my van closer so we can load up the chairs.\u201d</p><p>They go out the back, and I hang around, looking at the framed pictures on the wall. I wonder if they\u2019re for sale too. Some of them look really old: black-and-white pictures of men in suits and hats. There\u2019s one picture of a girl in a confirmation dress, it\u2019s white and lacy like a wedding gown. The girl isn\u2019t smiling, but she has a mischievous glint in her eye that reminds me of Kitty.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my daughter, Patricia.\u201d</p><p>I turn around. It\u2019s an old man in a navy blue sweater and stiff jeans. He\u2019s leaning against the staircase watching me. He looks very frail; his skin is paper white and thin.</p><p>\u201cShe lives in Ohio. She\u2019s an accountant.\u201d He\u2019s still gazing at me, like I remind him of someone.</p><p>\u201cYour house is lovely,\u201d I say, even though it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s old; it could use a good cleaning. But the things inside it are lovely.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s empty now. All my things sold up. Can\u2019t take it with you, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean when you die?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>He glares at me. \u201cNo. I mean to the nursing home.\u201d</p><p>Whoops. \u201cRight,\u201d I say, and I giggle the way I do when I feel awkward.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have there in your hand?\u201d</p><p>I lift it up. \u201cThis. He\u2014the man in the suit gave it to me. Do you want it back? I didn\u2019t pay for it. It\u2019s part of a lot.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, and the wrinkles in his paper skin deepen. \u201cThat was Patty\u2019s favorite.\u201d</p><p>I hold it out to him. \u201cMaybe she\u2019d like to keep it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you have it. It\u2019s yours. She couldn\u2019t even be bothered to help me move, so.\u201d He gives a spiteful nod. \u201cIs there anything else you want to take? I\u2019ve got a trunk full of her old clothes.\u201d</p><p>Yikes. Family drama. Best not to get involved in that. But vintage clothes! That\u2019s tempting.</p><p>When Peter finds me, I\u2019m sitting cross-legged on the floor in the music room, looking through an old trunk. Mr. Clarke is snoozing on the couch next to me. I found a mod minidress the color of cotton candy pink that I\u2019m crazy about, and a sleeveless button-down with little daisies on it that I can tie at the waist. \u201cLook, Peter!\u201d I lift up the dress. \u201cMr. Clarke said I could have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Mr. Clarke?\u201d Peter asks, and his voice fills the room.</p><p>I point at him and put my finger to my lips.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019d better get out of here fast before the guy in charge of the sale sees him giving stuff away for free.\u201d</p><p>I get up in a hurry. \u201cBye, Mr. Clarke,\u201d I say, not too loud. Probably better to let him sleep. He was very down earlier, when he was telling me about his divorce.</p><p>Mr. Clarke\u2019s eyes flutter open. \u201cIs this your feller?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not really,\u201d I say, and Peter throws his arm around my shoulder and says, \u201cYes, sir. I\u2019m her feller.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t like the way he says it, like he\u2019s making fun. Of both me and Mr. Clarke. \u201cThank you for the clothes, Mr. Clarke,\u201d I say, and he sits up straight and reaches for my hand. I give it to him and he kisses it, and his lips feel like dry moth\u2019s wings.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Patty.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I give him a good-bye wave and grab my new things. As we walk out the front door, Peter says, \u201cWho\u2019s Patty?\u201d and I pretend I don\u2019t hear.</p><p>I must fall asleep in about two seconds from the excitement of the day, because the next thing I know, we\u2019re parked in my driveway, and Peter\u2019s shaking my shoulder, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re here, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes. I\u2019m clutching my dress and shirt to my chest like a security blanket, and my reindeer is in my lap. My new treasures. I feel like I just robbed a bank and got away with it. \u201cThanks for today, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming with me.\u201d Then, abruptly, he says, \u201cOh yeah. I forgot to ask you something. My mom wants you to come over to dinner tomorrow night.\u201d</p> <p>My mouth drops. \u201cYou told your mom about us?\u201d</p><p>Peter gives me a dirty look. \u201cKitty knows about us! Besides, my mom and I are close. It\u2019s just her and me and my brother, Owen. If you don\u2019t want to come, then don\u2019t come. But just know that my mom will think you\u2019re rude if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying . . . the more people that know, the harder it is to manage. You have to keep lies restricted to as few people as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know so much about lying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I used to lie all the time as a kid.\u201d I didn\u2019t think of it as lying, though. I thought of it as playing make-believe. I told Kitty she was adopted and her real family was in a traveling circus. It\u2019s why she took up gymnastics.</p> <p>40</p><p>I\u2019M NOT SURE HOW DRESSED up I should get for dinner at Peter\u2019s house. At the store his mom seems so fancy. I just don\u2019t want to meet her and have her be thinking of all the ways that I\u2019m lacking compared to Genevieve. I don\u2019t see why I have to meet her at all.</p><p>But I do want her to like me.</p><p>I go through my closet, and then Margot\u2019s closet. I finally pick a cream-colored sweater and a blouse with a Peter Pan collar, with a corduroy mustard circle skirt. Plus tights and flats. Then I put on some makeup, which I hardly ever wear. I put on peach blush and I try to do some eye makeup, but I end up washing everything off and starting over again, this time with just mascara and lip gloss.</p><p>I go show Kitty and she says, \u201cLooks like a uniform.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike in a good way?\u201d</p> <p>Kitty nods. \u201cLike you work at a nice store.\u201d</p><p>Before Peter arrives at my house, I go on the computer and look up what fork to use with what, just in case.</p><p>It\u2019s strange. Sitting at Peter\u2019s kitchen table, I feel like I\u2019m living someone else\u2019s life. It turns out Peter\u2019s mom has made pizzas, so I didn\u2019t even need to worry about forks. And their house isn\u2019t fancy on the inside; it\u2019s just normal and nice. There\u2019s a real butter churner on display in the kitchen, pictures of Peter and his brother hanging on the walls in wooden frames, and red-and-white gingham everything.</p><p>There are a bunch of pizza toppings on the breakfast bar\u2014not just pepperoni and sausage and mushroom and pepper, but also artichoke hearts and greasy kalamata olives and fresh mozzarella and whole cloves of garlic.</p><p>Peter\u2019s mom is nice. She keeps putting more salad on my plate all throughout dinner, and I keep eating it even though I\u2019m full. Once, I catch her looking at me, and she has a soft smile on her face. When she smiles, she looks like Peter.</p><p>Peter\u2019s younger brother is named Owen. He\u2019s twelve. He\u2019s like a miniature Peter, but he doesn\u2019t talk as much. He doesn\u2019t have Peter\u2019s easy way. Owen grabs a slice of pizza and shoves it into his mouth even though it\u2019s too hot. He puffs out hot air and he almost spits a piece back out into his napkin, and their mom says, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare, Owen. We have company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone,\u201d Owen mumbles.</p><p>\u201cPeter says you have two sisters,\u201d Mrs. Kavinsky says with a bright smile. She cuts a piece of lettuce into bite-sized bits. \u201cYour mother must love having three girls.\u201d</p> <p>I open my mouth to answer her, but before I can, Peter does. He says, \u201cLara Jean\u2019s mom passed away when she was little.\u201d He says it like she should already know, and embarrassment crosses her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I remember that now.\u201d</p><p>Quickly I say, \u201cShe did love having three girls. They thought for sure my little sister Kitty was going to be a boy, and my mom said she was so used to girls she was nervous about what she was going to do with a boy. So she was really relieved when Kitty turned out to be a girl. My sister Margot and I were too; we would pray every night we\u2019d get a sister and not a brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong with boys?\u201d Peter objects.</p><p>Mrs. Kavinsky\u2019s smiling now. She puts another piece of pizza on Owen\u2019s plate and says, \u201cYou\u2019re heathens. Wild animals. I bet Lara Jean and her sisters are angels.\u201d</p><p>Peter snorts.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . Kitty might be part heathen,\u201d I admit. \u201cBut my older sister Margot and I are pretty good.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Kavinsky takes her napkin and tries to wipe tomato sauce off Owen\u2019s face, and he swats her hand away. \u201cMom!\u201d</p><p>When she gets up to take another pizza out of the oven, Peter says to me, \u201cSee how my mom babies him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe babies you way more,\u201d Owen counters. To me he mumbles, \u201cPeter doesn\u2019t even know how to cook ramen.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cCan you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah, I\u2019ve been cooking for myself for years,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI like to cook too,\u201d I say, taking a sip of iced tea. \u201cWe should give Peter a cooking lesson.\u201d</p><p>He eyes me and then says, \u201cYou wear more makeup than Genevieve did.\u201d</p><p>I shrink back like he slapped me. All I\u2019m wearing is mascara! And a little lip gloss! I know for a fact that Genevieve wears bronzer and eye shadow and concealer every day. Plus mascara and eyeliner and lipstick!</p><p>Swiftly Peter says, \u201cShut up, Owen.\u201d</p><p>Owen\u2019s snickering. I narrow my eyes. This kid is only a few years older than Kitty! I lean forward and wave my hand in front of my face. \u201cThis is all natural. But thank you for the compliment, Owen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he says, just like his big brother.</p><p>On the drive home, I say, \u201cHey, Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Just ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . your parents are divorced, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how often do you see your dad?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay. I was just wondering.\u201d</p><p>Peter looks over at me with expectant eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just waiting for the next question. You never just have one question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, do you miss him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s more that I miss how it used to be with us. Him and my mom and me and Owen. We were like a team. He used to come to every lacrosse game.\u201d Peter gets quiet. \u201cHe just . . . took care of things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s what dads do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he\u2019s doing for his new family.\u201d Peter says it matter-of-factly, without bitterness. \u201cWhat about you? You miss your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, when I think about it.\u201d Suddenly I say, \u201cYou know what I miss? I miss bath time. I miss when she would wash my hair. Don\u2019t you think getting your hair washed is just the best feeling? Like, warm water and bubbles and fingers in your hair. It\u2019s so nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I don\u2019t think about her at all, and then . . . and then sometimes I\u2019ll have a thought like, I wonder what she would think of me now? She only knew me as a little girl, and now I\u2019m a teenager, and I wonder, if she saw me on the street, would she recognize me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she would. She\u2019s your mom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, but I\u2019ve changed a lot.\u201d An uncomfortable look has crossed his face, and I can tell he\u2019s regretting complaining about his dad, because at least his dad is still alive. And then, because Peter\u2019s looking at me like he feels sorry for me, I straighten up and say in a haughty voice, \u201cI\u2019m very mature, you know.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s grinning now. \u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, I\u2019m very refined, Peter.\u201d</p><p>When Peter drops me off, right before I get out of the car, he says, \u201cI can tell my mom liked you.\u201d This makes me feel good inside. It\u2019s always been really important to me that other people\u2019s moms like me.</p><p>It was my favorite part of going over to Genevieve\u2019s house\u2014hanging out with her mom. Wendy was so stylish. She used to wear a silky blouse and nice pants and a statement necklace, just for sitting around the house. Perfect hair, always smooth and flat. Genevieve has that same good hair, but she doesn\u2019t have her mom\u2019s perfect straight nose. Hers has a little bump on the bridge that I think only adds to her appeal.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, you definitely don\u2019t wear more makeup than Gen. She was always getting bronzer on my white shirts.\u201d</p><p>For someone who\u2019s over Genevieve, he sure does talk about her a lot. Though it\u2019s not just him. I was thinking about her too. Even when she\u2019s not here, she\u2019s here. That girl has some kind of reach.</p><p>41</p> <p>DURING CHEMISTRY, PETER WRITES ME a note that says, Can I come over tonight to study for the test?</p><p>I write back, I don\u2019t remember study sessions being in the contract. After he reads it, he turns around and gives me a wounded look. I mouth, I\u2019m kidding!</p><p>At dinner I announce that Peter\u2019s coming over to study and we\u2019re going to need the kitchen, and my dad raises his eyebrows. \u201cLeave the door open,\u201d he jokes. We don\u2019t even have a door to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d I groan, and Kitty groans with me.</p><p>Casually he asks, \u201cIs Peter your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm . . . something like that,\u201d I say.</p><p>After we eat and Kitty and I do the dishes, I set up the kitchen like a study room. My textbook and notes are stacked up in the center of the table, with a row of highlighters in blue, yellow, and pink, a bowl of microwave kettle corn, and a plate of peanut-butter brownies I baked this afternoon. I let Kitty have two but that\u2019s it.</p><p>He said he\u2019d be over around eight. At first I think he\u2019s just late as usual, but the minutes tick by and I realize he\u2019s not coming. I text him once but he doesn\u2019t text back.</p><p>Kitty comes down between commercial breaks, sniffing around for another brownie, which I give her. \u201cIs Peter not coming?\u201d she asks. I pretend I\u2019m so absorbed in my studying I don\u2019t hear.</p><p>Around ten he sends a text that says, Sorry something came up. I can\u2019t come over tonight. He doesn\u2019t say where he is or what he\u2019s doing, but I already know. He\u2019s with Genevieve. At lunch he was distracted; he kept texting on his phone. And then, later in the day, I saw them outside the girls\u2019 locker room. They didn\u2019t see me, but I saw them. They were just talking, but with Genevieve it\u2019s never just anything. She put her hand on his arm; he brushed her hair out of her eyes. I may only be a fake girlfriend, but that\u2019s not nothing.</p><p>I keep studying, but it\u2019s hard to concentrate when your feelings are hurt. I tell myself it\u2019s just because I went to the trouble of baking brownies and cleaning up the downstairs. I mean, it\u2019s rude to just not show up somewhere. Does he not have manners? How would he like it if I did that? And really, what\u2019s the whole point of this charade if he\u2019s just going to keep going back to her anyway? What\u2019s even in it for me anymore? Things are better with Josh and me, practically normal. If I wanted to I could just call the whole thing off.</p><p>The next morning, I wake up still mad. I call Josh to ask him for a ride to school. For a second I worry he might not pick up; it\u2019s been so long since we hung out. But he does, and he says no problem.</p><p>Let\u2019s see how Peter likes it when he comes to my house to pick me up and I\u2019m not there.</p><p>Halfway to school I start to feel uneasy. Maybe Peter had a legitimate reason for not coming over. Maybe he wasn\u2019t with Genevieve and now I\u2019ve just done a very petty thing out of spite.</p><p>Josh is looking at me with suspicious eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t believe me, I can tell. \u201cDid you and Kavinsky have a fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Josh sighs and says, \u201cJust be careful.\u201d He says it in a patronizing older-brother kind of way that makes me want to scream. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see you hurt by that guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosh! He won\u2019t hurt me. Geez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a douche. I\u2019m sorry, but he is. All the guys on the lacrosse team are. Guys like Kavinsky, they only care about one thing. As soon as they get what they want, they\u2019re bored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Peter. He dated Genevieve for almost four years!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust trust me. You haven\u2019t had much experience with guys, Lara Jean.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Quietly I ask, \u201cHow would you know?\u201d</p><p>Josh gives me an Oh, come on look. \u201cBecause I know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as well as you think.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re quiet the rest of the way.</p> <p>It won\u2019t be that big of a deal. Peter will stop by my house, see that I\u2019m not there, and then he\u2019ll leave. Big deal, so he had to go five minutes out of his way. I waited for him last night for two friggin\u2019 hours.</p><p>When we get to school, Josh heads for the senior hall and I go straight to the junior hall. I keep sneaking peeks down the hallway at Peter\u2019s locker, but he doesn\u2019t arrive. I wait at my locker until the bell rings, and he still doesn\u2019t come. I run off to first period, my backpack banging against my back as I go.</p><p>Mr. Schuller is taking attendance, when I look up and see Peter standing in the doorway glaring at me. He gestures at me to come out. I gulp and quickly look down at my notebook and pretend like I didn\u2019t see him. But then he hisses my name, and I know I have to talk to him.</p><p>Shakily I raise my hand. \u201cMr. Schuller, can I go the bathroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have gone before class,\u201d he grumbles, but he waves me on.</p> <p>I hurry out to the hallway and pull Peter away from the door so Mr. Schuller can\u2019t see.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you this morning?\u201d Peter demands.</p><p>I cross my arms and try to stand tall. It\u2019s hard, because I\u2019m so short and he really is tall. \u201cYou\u2019re one to talk.\u201d</p><p>Peter huffs, \u201cAt least I texted you! I\u2019ve called you like seventeen times. Why is your phone off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know we\u2019re not allowed to have our phones on at school!\u201d</p><p>He huffs, \u201cLara Jean, I waited in front of your house for twenty minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Yikes. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get to school? Sanderson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Peter exhales. \u201cListen, if you were pissed I couldn\u2019t come over last night, you should\u2019ve just called and said so instead of the shit you pulled this morning.\u201d</p><p>In a small voice I say, \u201cWell, what about that shit you pulled last night?\u201d</p><p>A smile tugs at the corners of his mouth. \u201cDid you just say \u2018shit\u2019? It sounds really funny coming out of your mouth.\u201d</p><p>I ignore that. \u201cSo . . . where were you? Were you with Genevieve?\u201d I don\u2019t ask what I really want to know, which is, Did you guys get back together?</p><p>He hesitates and then he says, \u201cShe needed me.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t even look at him. Why is he such a dummy? Why does she have such a hold on him? Is it just the amount of time they\u2019ve been together? Is it the sex? I don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s disappointing, how little self-control boys have. \u201cPeter, if you\u2019re just going to go running every time she beckons, I don\u2019t see a point to any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCovey, come on! I said I was sorry. Don\u2019t be pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never said you were sorry,\u201d I say. \u201cWhen did you say you were sorry?\u201d</p><p>Chastened, he says, \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go to Genevieve\u2019s anymore. How do you think that makes me look to her?\u201d</p><p>Peter looks at me steadily. \u201cI can\u2019t not be there for Gen, so don\u2019t ask me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Peter, what does she even need you for when she has a new boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>He flinches, and right away I\u2019m sorry I said it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t expect you to understand it. Gen and I . . . we just get each other.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t know it, but when Peter talks about Genevieve, he gets a certain softness in his face. It\u2019s tenderness mixed with impatience. And something else. Love. Peter can protest all he wants, but I know he still loves her.</p><p>Sighing, I ask, \u201cDid you at least study for the test?\u201d</p><p>Peter shakes his head, and I sigh again.</p><p>\u201cYou can look at my notes during lunch,\u201d I say, and I head back to my class.</p><p>It\u2019s starting to make sense to me. Why he\u2019d go along with a scheme like this, why he\u2019d spend his time with someone like me. It\u2019s not so he can move on from Gen. It\u2019s so he can\u2019t. I\u2019m just his excuse. I\u2019m holding Genevieve\u2019s place for her. When that piece makes sense, everything else starts to.</p><p>42</p><p>JOSH\u2019S PARENTS FIGHT A LOT. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a normal amount of fighting because I only have one parent, but I don\u2019t remember my parents fighting that much when I had two. Our houses are close enough that I can hear them sometimes, if my window is open. The fights usually start out with something small, like Mrs. Sanderson accidentally leaving the car door open and the battery going dead, and end with something big, like how Mr. Sanderson works too much and is inherently selfish and not cut out for a family.</p><p>When they fight bad, Josh comes over. When we were younger, he\u2019d sneak out sometimes in his pajamas with his pillow, and he\u2019d stay until his mom came looking for him. It\u2019s not something we talk about. Maybe him and Margot, but not me and him. The most he ever said about it was that sometimes he wished they\u2019d just get divorced so it could finally be over. They never did, though.</p><p>I can hear them tonight. I\u2019ve heard them other nights since Margot left, but tonight sounds particularly bad. So bad I close my window. I gather up my homework and go downstairs and turn on the living room light so Josh knows he can come over if he wants.</p><p>Half an hour later there\u2019s a knock at the door. I wrap myself in my pale blue baby blanket and open it.</p><p>It\u2019s Josh. He smiles at me sheepishly. \u201cHey. Can I hang out here for a bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourse you can.\u201d I leave the door open and trudge back to the living room. I call back, \u201cLock it behind you.\u201d</p><p>Josh watches TV and I do my homework. I\u2019m highlighting my way through US history when Josh asks me, \u201cAre you going to try out for Arcadia?\u201d That\u2019s the spring play. They just announced it yesterday.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, switching highlighter colors. \u201cWhy would I?\u201d I hate public speaking and getting up in front of people, and Josh knows it.</p><p>\u201cDuh, because it\u2019s your favorite play.\u201d Josh changes the channel. \u201cI think you\u2019d be a really good Thomasina.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cThanks but no thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It could be something good to put on your college apps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to be a theater major or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t kill you to get out of your comfort zone a little bit,\u201d he says, stretching his arms out behind his head. \u201cTake a risk. Look at Margot. She\u2019s all the way over in Scotland.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not Margot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying you should move to the other side of the world.

I\u2019m just saying . . . your world could be bigger than just playing checkers with Kitty and riding around in Kavinsky\u2019s car.\u201d</p> <p>I stop highlighting midsentence. Is he right? Is my world really that small? It\u2019s not like his world is so big! \u201cJosh,\u201d I begin. Then I pause, because I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to finish the sentence.

I just mean that you should give people a chance to know you.\u201d Josh points the remote control at me and says, \u201cIf people knew you, they would love you.\u201d He sounds so matter-of-fact.</p><p>Josh, you break my heart. And you\u2019re a liar. Because you know me, you know me better than almost anybody, and you don\u2019t love me.</p> <p>After Josh goes back home, I tidy up the living room, lock all the doors, and turn off the lights. Then I pour myself a glass of water and head upstairs.</p><p>The light is on in my bedroom, and Chris is asleep in my bed. I roll her to the side so I can fit in too. Stirring, she mumbles, \u201cWanna go get hot wings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late to eat hot wings,\u201d I say, pulling my quilt up so it covers both of us. \u201cYou just missed Josh.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes fly open. \u201cJoshy was here? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason.\u201d I won\u2019t tell Josh\u2019s secrets, not even to Chris.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t mention it to Kavinsky.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t care,\u201d I say.</p><p>Chris shakes her head. \u201cAll boys care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter\u2019s not like that. He\u2019s really confident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re the ones that care the most,\u201d she says. I\u2019m about to ask her what she means, but before I can, she says, \u201cLet\u2019s go do something wild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d It\u2019s a school night; I can\u2019t go anywhere and she knows it. But I still like to hear her schemes. They\u2019re like bedtime stories.</p><p>\u201cLike . . . I don\u2019t know. We could sneak into the nursing home and break out that grandma you\u2019re always talking about. What\u2019s her name again? Thunder?\u201d</p><p>I giggle. \u201cStormy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Stormy.\u201d She yawns. \u201cShe seems like she knows how to have a good time. I bet she\u2019d buy us cocktails.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStormy goes to sleep at nine every night to get her beauty rest. Let\u2019s do it tomorrow.\u201d By tomorrow, Chris will have forgotten all about it, but it\u2019s still a nice thought. Her eyes are closed again. I poke her in the side. \u201cChris, wake up. Go brush your teeth.\u201d I keep a toothbrush in my bathroom drawer just for her. I painted a cursive C on it with red nail polish so it doesn\u2019t get mixed up with anybody else\u2019s toothbrush.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. I\u2019m too tired to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA second ago you wanted to break Stormy out of Belleview, and now you\u2019re too tired to wash your face and brush your teeth?\u201d</p><p>Chris smiles but doesn\u2019t open her eyes.</p><p>I turn off my bedside lamp. \u201cNight, Chris.\u201d</p><p>She wriggles closer to me. \u201cG\u2019night.\u201d</p><p>43</p><p>THERE ARE VERY LIMITED OPTIONS for Asian girls on Halloween. Like one year I went as Velma from Scooby-Doo, but people just asked me if I was a manga character. I even wore a wig! So now I\u2019m committed to dressing up as Asian characters exclusively.</p><p>Margot never goes as a person; she is always an inanimate object or a concept of some kind. Like last year she went as a \u201cformal apology\u201d: she wore a floor-length evening gown we found at Goodwill for ten dollars, and she had a sign around her neck, written in calligraphy, which said, I\u2019m sorry. It won second prize in the school contest. First prize went to a Rastafarian alien.</p><p>Kitty\u2019s going as a ninja, which I suppose is in line with my whole Asian costume idea.</p><p>This year I\u2019m going as Cho Chang from Harry Potter. I\u2019ve got my Ravenclaw scarf and an old black choir robe I found on eBay, plus one of my dad\u2019s ties and a wand. I\u2019m not going to win any contests, but at least people will know what I am. I wish I never have to answer a What are you? question ever again.</p><p>I\u2019m waiting for Peter to pick me up for school, messing with my knee-highs. They won\u2019t stay up.</p><p>\u201cLara Jean!\u201d</p><p>Automatically I call back, \u201cJosh!\u201d It\u2019s our version of Marco Polo.</p><p>Then I look up. There\u2019s Josh, standing in front of his car. In a full-on Harry Potter costume. Black robe, glasses, lightning mark on his forehead, wand.</p><p>We both burst out laughing. Of all the random costumes! Ruefully Josh says, \u201cThe guys from the graphic-novel club are going as different fantasy-book characters. I was going to go as Drogo from Game of Thrones because, you know, I\u2019ve got the upper body for it, but . . .\u201d</p><p>I giggle, trying to picture Josh with eyeliner and a long braid and no shirt. It\u2019s a funny picture. I wouldn\u2019t exactly call Josh scrawny, but . . .</p><p>\u201cHey, quit laughing so hard,\u201d he objects. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that funny.\u201d He jingles his keys. \u201cSo do you need a ride, Cho?\u201d</p><p>I look at my phone. Peter\u2019s five minutes late as usual. Not that I can really complain, because it\u2019s a free ride to school, and I could be taking the bus. But if I go with Josh, I won\u2019t have to rush to class, I can go by my locker, I can go pee, I can get a juice at the vending machine. But he\u2019s probably already nearly here. \u201cThanks, but I\u2019m waiting for Peter.\u201d</p><p>Josh nods. \u201cOh, yeah . . . right.\u201d He starts to climb into his car.</p><p>I shout out, \u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d and Josh spins around and calls back, \u201cFinite!\u201d Then we grin at each other like goofs.</p><p>He drives off and I hug my knees to my chest. Josh and I read Harry Potter around the same time, when I was in sixth and he was in seventh. Margot had already read them. Neither of us can read as fast as she does. It drove her crazy waiting for us to get to the third book so we could discuss.</p><p>The longer I sit waiting for Peter, the more prickly I feel. I take off my robe and put it back on a few times. It\u2019s polyester, and polyester doesn\u2019t breathe or feel nice against your skin. When he drives up, I run to his car and get in without saying hello. I spread my robe over my lap like a blanket, because my kilt is short. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyes are big. \u201cYou look hot,\u201d he says, sounding surprised. \u201cWhat are you? An anime character?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, or more like snap. \u201cI\u2019m Cho Chang.\u201d Peter still has a blank look on his face, so I add, \u201cFrom Harry Potter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. Cool.\u201d</p><p>I look over at him. He\u2019s wearing a regular button-down and jeans. \u201cWhere\u2019s your costume?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe and my boys are going to change right before the assembly. It\u2019s a better effect if we unveil at the same time.\u201d</p><p>I know he wants me to ask what his costume is, but I don\u2019t feel like talking to him, so I sit there, not saying anything and looking out the window. I keep waiting for him to ask me what\u2019s wrong, but he doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s so oblivious; I don\u2019t even think he notices I\u2019m mad.</p><p>Abruptly I say, \u201cI wish you weren\u2019t always late.\u201d</p><p>Peter frowns. \u201cGeez, sorry. I was trying to get my costume together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday you were trying to get your costume together. But you\u2019re late all the time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not late all the time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were late today, and yesterday, and last Thursday.\u201d I stare out the window. The autumn leaves are already falling. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to be on time, I don\u2019t want you giving me rides anymore.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have to look; I can feel him glaring at me. \u201cFine. That means I get five extra minutes of sleep, so, works for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>During the judging, Chris and I are sitting in the balcony of the theater. Chris is dressed up as Courtney Love. She\u2019s wearing a pink slip and holey knee socks and lots of smudgy eye makeup. \u201cYou should go down there too,\u201d I say. \u201cI bet you\u2019d win something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople at this school wouldn\u2019t even know who she is,\u201d Chris sneers. But I can tell she kind of wants to.</p> <p>The guys in Peter\u2019s group are all superheroes. There\u2019s Batman, Superman, Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, all to varying degrees of effort. Peter went all out. He is, of course, Peter Parker. Who else would Kavinsky go as? His Spider-Man costume is super authentic, with yellow Mylar eyes and gloved hands and bootied feet. He is a total ham up onstage. All the guys run around, capes flapping, pretend fighting each other. Peter tries to climb up a column, but Mr. Yelznik stops him before he can get far. I cheer when his group wins for best group costume.</p><p>Genevieve is Catwoman. She\u2019s wearing pleather leggings and a bustier and black cat ears. I wonder if she was in on the superhero theme, if Peter told her, or if she came up with that on her own. Every guy in the auditorium goes wild when she goes onstage for best junior costume. \u201cWhat a ho,\u201d Chris says. She sounds almost wistful.</p><p>Genevieve wins, of course. I sneak a look at Peter, and he\u2019s whistling and stomping his feet with all his friends.</p><p>After the assembly I\u2019m getting my chem book out of my locker when Peter comes over and leans his back against the locker next to mine. Through his mask he says, \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say. And then he doesn\u2019t say anything else; he just stands there. I close my locker door and spin the combination lock. \u201cCongratulations on winning best group costume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? That\u2019s all you\u2019re going to say?\u201d</p><p>Huh? \u201cWhat else am I supposed to say?\u201d</p><p>Just then Josh walks by with Jersey Mike, who\u2019s dressed up as a hobbit, hairy feet and all. Walking backward, Josh points his wand at me and says, \u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d</p> <p>Automatically I point my wand back at him and say, \u201cAvada Kedavra!\u201d</p><p>Josh clutches his chest like I\u2019ve shot him. \u201cWay harsh!\u201d he calls out, and he disappears down the hallway.</p><p>\u201cUh . . . don\u2019t you think it\u2019s weird for my supposed girlfriend to wear a couples costume with another guy?\u201d Peter asks me.</p><p>I roll my eyes. I\u2019m still mad at him from this morning. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t talk to you when you look like this. How am I supposed to have a conversation with a person in head-to-toe latex?\u201d</p><p>Peter pushes his mask up. \u201cI\u2019m serious! How do you think it makes me look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, it wasn\u2019t planned. Second of all, nobody cares what my costume is! Who would even notice something like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople notice,\u201d Peter huffs. \u201cI noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m very sorry that a coincidence like this would ever occur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really doubt it was a coincidence,\u201d Peter mutters.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do? Do you want me to pop over to the Halloween store during lunch and buy a red wig and be Mary Jane?\u201d</p><p>Smoothly Peter says, \u201cCould you? That\u2019d be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I could not. You know why? Because I\u2019m Asian, and people will just think I\u2019m in a manga costume.\u201d I hand him my wand. \u201cHold this.\u201d I lean down and lift the hem of my robe so I can adjust my knee socks.</p><p>Frowning, he says, \u201cI could have been someone from the book if you\u2019d told me in advance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, today you\u2019d make a really great Moaning Myrtle.\u201d</p><p>Peter gives me a blank look, and disbelieving, I say, \u201cWait a minute . . . have you never read Harry Potter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve read the first two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should know who Moaning Myrtle is!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a really long time ago,\u201d Peter says. \u201cWas she one of those people in the paintings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! And how could you stop after Chamber of Secrets? The third one\u2019s the best out of the whole series. I mean, that\u2019s literally crazy to me.\u201d I peer at his face. \u201cDo you not have a soul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry if I haven\u2019t read every single Harry Potter book! Sorry I have a life and I\u2019m not in the Final Fantasy club or whatever that geek club is called\u2014\u201d</p><p>I snatch my wand back from him and wave it in his face. \u201cSilencio!\u201d</p><p>Peter crosses his arms. Smirking, he says, \u201cWhatever spell you just tried to cast on me, it didn\u2019t work, so I think you need to go back to Hogwarts.\u201d He\u2019s so proud of himself for the Hogwarts reference, it\u2019s kind of endearing.</p><p>Quick like a cat I pull down his mask, and then I put one hand over his mouth. With my other hand I wave my wand again. \u201cSilencio!\u201d Peter tries to say something, but I press my hand harder. \u201cWhat? What was that? I can\u2019t hear you, Peter Parker.\u201d</p><p>Peter reaches out and tickles me, and I laugh so hard I almost drop my wand. I dart away from him but he pounces after me, pretend shooting webs at my feet. Giggling, I run away from him, further down the hall, dodging groups of people. He gives chase all the way to chem class. A teacher screams at us to slow down, and we do, but as soon as we\u2019re around the corner, I\u2019m running again and so is he. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m breathless by the time I\u2019m in my seat. He turns around and shoots a web in my direction, and I explode into giggles again and Mr. Meyers glares at me. \u201cSettle down,\u201d he says, and I nod obediently. As soon as his back is turned, I giggle into my robe. I want to still be mad at Peter, but it\u2019s just no use.</p><p>Halfway through class he sends me a note. He\u2019s drawn spiderwebs around the edges. It says, I\u2019ll be on time tomorrow. I smile as I read it. Then I put it in my backpack, in my French textbook so the page won\u2019t crease or crumble. I want to keep it so when this is over, I can have something to look at and remember what it was like to be Peter Kavinsky\u2019s girlfriend. Even if it was all just pretend.</p><p>44</p><p>WHEN WE PULL UP IN my driveway, Kitty runs out of the house and over to the car. \u201cSpider-Man!\u201d she shrieks. She\u2019s still in her ninja costume, though she\u2019s taken the mask off. \u201cAre you coming inside?\u201d</p> <p>I glance at Peter. \u201cHe can\u2019t. He has to go condition.\u201d Peter spends an hour a day conditioning for lacrosse. He\u2019s very dedicated to it.</p><p>\u201cCondition?\u201d Kitty repeats, and I know she\u2019s imagining Peter washing his hair.</p><p>\u201cI can hang out for a little bit,\u201d Peter says, turning the engine off.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s show him the dance!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitty, no.\u201d The dance is something Margot and I made up when we were bored one night a few summers ago at the beach. Let\u2019s just say neither of us is particularly talented at choreography.</p> <p>Peter\u2019s eyes light up. He\u2019ll take any opportunity for a laugh, especially at my expense. \u201cI wanna see the dance!\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget about it,\u201d I tell him. We\u2019re in the living room; each of us has our own couch or armchair. I poured us iced teas and put out a bowl of potato chips, which we\u2019ve already finished.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he pouts. \u201cShow me the dance. Please, please show me the dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to work on me, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not going to work?\u201d</p><p>I wave my hand in his Handsome Boy face. \u201cThat. I\u2019m immune to your charms, remember?\u201d</p> <p>Peter lifts his eyebrows like I\u2019ve dared him. \u201cIs that a challenge? \u2019Cause I\u2019m warning you, you do not want to step into the ring with me. I\u2019ll crush you, Covey.\u201d He doesn\u2019t take his eyes off mine for several long seconds, and I can feel my smile fade and my cheeks heat up.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Lara Jean!\u201d</p><p>I blink. Kitty. I\u2019d forgotten she was still in the room. I scramble to my feet. \u201cCue up the music. Peter just challenged us to a dance-off.\u201d</p><p>Kitty squeals and runs to turn on the speakers. I push back the coffee table. We take our places in front of the fireplace, backs turned, heads down, hands clasped behind our backs.</p><p>When the bass kicks in, we jump and turn around. Hip thrust, swivel, then move into our knee slides. Then the running man, then this move Margot made up called the treadmill. The music stops, and Kitty and I freeze in our crunking positions\u2014and then it starts up again, and we\u2019re doing the butterfly, then back into the knee slides. I forget what the next move is so I sneak a peek at Kitty, who\u2019s shimmying and clapping her hands. Oh yeah.</p><p>Our big finish is splits, with our arms crossed for emphasis.</p><p>Peter\u2019s bowled over, laughing his head off. He claps and claps and stomps his feet.</p><p>When it\u2019s over, I try to catch my breath and manage to say, \u201cOkay, you\u2019re up, Kavinsky.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Peter gasps. \u201cHow do I follow a performance like that? Kitty, will you teach me that pop-and-lock move?\u201d</p><p>Kitty gets shy all of a sudden. She sits on her hands and looks at him through her lashes and shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cPlease, please?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Kitty finally caves in\u2014I think she just wanted to make him work for it. I watch them dance all afternoon, my little sister the ninja and my pretend boyfriend Spider-Man. First I laugh, but then a worrying thought comes out of nowhere\u2014I can\u2019t let Kitty get too attached to Peter. This is temporary. The way Kitty looks at him, so adoringly, like he\u2019s her hero. . . .</p><p>When Peter has to leave, I walk him out to his car. Before he gets in, I say, \u201cI don\u2019t think you should come over anymore. It\u2019s confusing to Kitty.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, he says, \u201cHow is it confusing to Kitty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause . . . because when our . . . our thing is over, she\u2019s going to miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll still see the kid around.\u201d Peter pokes me in the stomach. \u201cI want joint custody.\u201d</p><p>All I can think of is how patient he was with her, how sweet. Impulsively I get up on my tiptoes and kiss him on the cheek, and he jerks back in surprise.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>My cheeks feel scalded. I say, \u201cFor being so nice to Kitty.\u201d Then I wave good-bye and I run into the house.</p><p>45</p><p>IF I DON\u2019T BUY GROCERIES today, it\u2019s scrambled eggs for dinner tonight. Again.</p><p>Margot\u2019s car is fixed and sitting in the driveway, where it\u2019s been sitting for the past few weeks. I could go to the store if I wanted to. I do want to. But I don\u2019t want to drive. If I was a nervous driver before, the accident has only made me worse. What business do I have behind the wheel of a car? What if I hurt someone? What if I hurt Kitty? They shouldn\u2019t just give out driver\u2019s licenses so easily. I mean, a car is a really dangerous thing. It\u2019s practically a weapon.</p><p>But the store is less than ten minutes away. It\u2019s not like I\u2019d be getting on the highway. And I really really don\u2019t want to eat scrambled eggs for dinner tonight. Besides . . . if Peter and Genevieve are getting back together, he won\u2019t be giving me rides anymore. I\u2019ve got to learn how to do for myself. I can\u2019t depend on other people to help me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to the store, Kitty,\u201d I say.</p><p>She\u2019s lying down in front of the TV, propped up on her elbows. Her body looks so long; it\u2019s getting longer every day. Pretty soon she\u2019ll be taller than me. Kitty doesn\u2019t look away from the TV. \u201cI don\u2019t want to come. I want to watch my shows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you come, I\u2019ll let you pick out an ice cream.\u201d</p><p>Kitty gets to her feet.</p><p>On the drive there, I\u2019m going so slow that Kitty keeps telling me the speed limit. \u201cThey give tickets for going under the limit too, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one. I just know it. I bet I\u2019m going to be a better driver than you, Lara Jean.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I grip the steering wheel tighter. \u201cI bet you are.\u201d Brat. I bet when Kitty starts driving, she\u2019s going to be a speed demon without the slightest concern for those around her. But she\u2019ll still probably be better at it than me. A reckless driver is better than a scared one; ask anybody.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared of things like you are.\u201d</p><p>I adjust my rearview mirror. \u201cYou sure are proud of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs there a car coming? Can I switch lanes?\u201d</p><p>Kitty turns her head. \u201cYou can go, but hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike how much time do I have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already too late. Wait . . . now you can go. Go!\u201d</p><p>I jerk into the left lane and look in my rearview. \u201cGood job, Kitty. You just keep being my second pair of eyes.\u201d</p> <p>As we push the cart around the store, I\u2019m thinking about the drive home and having to get behind the wheel again. My heart still races even as I\u2019m trying to decide if we should have zucchini or green beans with dinner. By the time we\u2019re in the dairy aisle, Kitty\u2019s whining. \u201cCan you hurry? I don\u2019t want to miss my next show!\u201d</p><p>To appease her, I say, \u201cGo pick out an ice cream,\u201d and Kitty heads off toward the frozen-food aisle.</p><p>The way home, I stay in the right lane for blocks and blocks so I don\u2019t have to switch lanes. The car in front of me is an old lady, and she\u2019s moving at a snail\u2019s pace, which suits me just fine. Kitty begs me to switch lanes, but I just ignore her and keep doing what I\u2019m doing, nice and easy. My hands are gripping the steering wheel so tightly my knuckles are white.</p><p>\u201cThe ice cream\u2019s going to be all melted by the time we get home,\u201d Kitty gripes. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve missed every single one of my shows. Can you please go to the fast lane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitty!\u201d I screech. \u201cWill you just let me drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen drive already!\u201d</p> <p>I lean across the console to cuff her upside the head, and she scoots closer to the window so I can\u2019t reach her. \u201cCan\u2019t touch me,\u201d she says gleefully.</p><p>\u201cQuit playing around and be my eyes,\u201d I say.</p><p>A car is coming up on my right, zooming off a highway exit. He\u2019s going to have to merge into my lane soon. Lightning fast I look over my shoulder for my blind spot, to see if I can switch lanes. Every time I have to take my eyes away from the road, even for a second, I feel so much panic in my chest. But I don\u2019t have a choice, I just hold my breath and I switch over to the left lane. Nothing bad happens. I exhale.</p><p>My heart races the whole way home. But we make it, no accidents and nobody honking their horn at me, and that\u2019s the important thing. And the ice cream is fine, only a little melted on top. It will get easier each time, I think. I hope. I just have to keep trying.</p><p>I can\u2019t stand the thought of Kitty being scornful of me. I\u2019m her big sister. I have to be someone she looks up to, the way I look up to Margot. How can Kitty look up to me if I\u2019m weak?</p><p>That night I pack Kitty\u2019s and my lunches. I make what Mommy used to make us sometimes when we went on picnics at the winery in Keswick. I dice up a carrot and an onion and fry it with sesame oil and a little vinegar; then I mix in sushi rice. When it\u2019s cooked, I scoop pats of rice into tofu skins. They\u2019re like rice balls in little purses. I don\u2019t have an exact recipe to follow, but it tastes right enough. When I\u2019m finished, I get on a ladder and search for the bento boxes Mommy used to put them in. I finally find them in the back of the Tupperware cabinet.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if Kitty will remember eating these rice balls, but I hope that her heart will.</p><p>46</p> <p>AT THE LUNCH TABLE PETER and his friends can\u2019t get enough of the rice balls. I only get to eat three. \u201cThese are so good,\u201d Peter keeps saying. When he reaches for the last one, he stops short and quickly looks up at me to see if I noticed.</p><p>\u201cYou can have it,\u201d I say. I know what he\u2019s thinking of. The last piece of pizza.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s all right, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want it!\u201d</p><p>I pick up the rice ball with my fingers and put it in his face. \u201cSay \u2018ah.\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Stubbornly he says, \u201cNo. I\u2019m not going to give you the satisfaction of being right.\u201d</p><p>Darrell hoots with laughter. \u201cI\u2019m jealous of you, Kavinsky. I wish I had a girl to feed me my lunch. Lara Jean, if he doesn\u2019t take it, I will.\u201d He leans forward and opens his mouth for me.</p><p>Peter shoves him to the side and says, \u201cStep off, it\u2019s mine!\u201d He opens his mouth and I pop it in like he\u2019s a seal at Sea World. With his mouth full of rice and his eyes closed, he says, \u201cYum yum yum.\u201d</p><p>I smile, because it\u2019s so cute. And for a second, just for a second, I forget. I forget that this isn\u2019t real.</p><p>Peter swallows the food in his mouth and says, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why do you look sad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sad. I\u2019m hungry because you guys ate my lunch.\u201d I cross my eyes at him to show him I\u2019m joking.</p><p>Immediately Peter pushes out his chair and stands up. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get you a sandwich.\u201d</p><p>I grab his sleeve. \u201cDon\u2019t. I\u2019m just kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d I nod, and he sits back down. \u201cIf you\u2019re hungry later, we can stop somewhere on the way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout that,\u201d I say. \u201cMy car\u2019s fixed now, so I won\u2019t be needing you to give me rides anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Peter leans back in his chair. \u201cI don\u2019t mind picking you up, though. I know you hate to drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only way I\u2019ll get better is if I practice,\u201d I say, feeling like Margot. Margot the Good. \u201cBesides, now you\u2019ll get back your extra five minutes of sleep.\u201d</p><p>Peter grins. \u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>47</p><p>VIRTUAL SUNDAY NIGHT DINNER WAS an idea I thought up.</p><p>I\u2019ve got my laptop propped up on a stack of books in the center of the table. Daddy and Kitty and I are all sitting in front of it with our slices of pizza. It\u2019s our lunchtime and Margot\u2019s dinnertime. Margot\u2019s sitting at her desk with a salad. She\u2019s already in her flannel pj\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are eating pizza again?\u201d Margot gives me and Daddy a disapproving look. \u201cKitty\u2019s going to stay tiny if you don\u2019t feed her any green food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, Gogo, there\u2019s peppers on this pizza,\u201d I say, holding up my slice, and everybody laughs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be spinach salad with dinner tonight,\u201d Daddy offers.</p><p>\u201cCan you make my spinach portion into a green juice instead?\u201d Kitty asks. \u201cThat\u2019s the healthiest way to eat spinach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Margot asks.</p><p>\u201cFrom Peter.\u201d</p> <p>The pizza slice that was halfway to my mouth freezes in midair.</p><p>\u201cPeter who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara Jean\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute . . . Lara Jean\u2019s dating who?\u201d On the computer screen Margot\u2019s eyes are huge and incredulous.</p><p>\u201cPeter Kavinsky,\u201d Kitty chirps.</p> <p>I whip my head around and give her a dirty look. With my eyes I say, Thanks for spilling the beans, Kitty. With her eyes she says, What? You should have told her yourself ages ago.</p><p>Margot looks from Kitty to me. \u201cWhat in the world? How did that happen?\u201d</p><p>Lamely I say, \u201cIt just sort of . . . happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious? Why would you ever be interested in someone like Peter Kavinsky? He\u2019s such a . . .\u201d Margot shakes her head in disbelief. \u201cI mean, did you know Josh caught him cheating on a test once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter cheats at school?\u201d Daddy repeats, alarmed.</p><p>I quickly look at him and say, \u201cOnce, in seventh grade! Seventh grade doesn\u2019t even count anymore it\u2019s so long ago. And it wasn\u2019t a test, it was a quiz.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI definitely don\u2019t think he\u2019s a good guy for you. All of those lacrosse guys are so douchey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Peter\u2019s not like those other guys.\u201d I don\u2019t understand why Margot can\u2019t just be happy for me. I was at least pretend happy for her when she started dating Josh. She could be pretend happy for me too. And it makes me mad, the way she\u2019s saying all of this stuff in front of Daddy and Kitty. \u201cIf you talk to him, if you just give him a chance, you\u2019ll see, Margot.\u201d I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m bothering trying to convince her of Peter when it will be over soon anyway. But I want her to know that he is a good guy, because he is.</p><p>Margot makes a face like Yeah, okay, sure and I know she doesn\u2019t believe me. \u201cWhat about Genevieve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey broke up months ago.\u201d</p><p>Daddy looks confused and says, \u201cPeter and Genevieve were an item?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind, Daddy,\u201d I say.</p><p>Margot is quiet, chewing on her salad, so I think she\u2019s done, but then she says, \u201cHe\u2019s not very smart, though, is he? I mean, at school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everybody can be a National Merit Scholar! And there are different kinds of intelligence, you know. He has a high emotional IQ.\u201d Margot\u2019s disapproval makes me feel prickly all over. More than prickly. Mad. What right does she have to weigh in when she doesn\u2019t even live here anymore? Kitty has more of a right than she does. \u201cKitty, do you like Peter?\u201d I ask her. I know she\u2019ll say yes.</p> <p>Kitty perks up, and I can tell she is pleased to be included in the big-girl talk. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Surprised, Margot says, \u201cKitty, you\u2019ve hung out with him too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. He comes over all the time. He gives us rides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn his two-seater?\u201d Margot shoots a look at me.</p><p>Kitty pipes up. \u201cNo, in his mom\u2019s van!\u201d With innocent eyes she says, \u201cI want to go for a ride in his convertible. I\u2019ve never been in a convertible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he doesn\u2019t drive around his Audi anymore?\u201d Margot asks me.</p><p>\u201cNot when Kitty\u2019s riding with us,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHmm\u201d is all Margot says, and the skeptical look on her face makes me want to x her right off the screen.</p><p>48</p><p>AFTER SCHOOL I GET A text from josh.</p><p>You, me, and the diner like old times.</p><p>Except old times would have included Margot. Now it\u2019s new times, I suppose. Maybe that\u2019s not altogether a bad thing. New can be good.</p><p>OK but I\u2019m getting my own grilled cheese because you always hog more than your fair share.</p><p>Deal.</p><p>We\u2019re sitting in our booth by the jukebox.</p><p>I wonder what Margot\u2019s doing right now. It\u2019s nighttime in Scotland. Maybe she\u2019s getting ready to go out to the pub with her hallmates. Margot says pubs are really big over there; they have what they call pub crawls, where they go from pub to pub and drink and drink. Margot\u2019s not some big drinker, I\u2019ve never even seen her drunk. I hope she\u2019s learned how to by now.</p><p>I hold my hand out for quarters. Another Lara Jean\u2013and-Josh tradition. Josh always gives me quarters for the jukebox. It\u2019s because he keeps mounds of them in his car for the tollbooth, and I never have quarters because I hate change.</p><p>I can\u2019t decide if I want doo-wop or folksy guitar, but then at the last second I put in \u201cVideo Killed the Radio Star,\u201d for Margot. So in a way it\u2019s like she is here.</p><p>Josh smiles when it comes on. \u201cI knew you\u2019d pick that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you didn\u2019t, because I didn\u2019t know I was going to until I did.\u201d I pick up my menu and study it like I haven\u2019t seen it a million times.</p><p>Josh is still smiling. \u201cWhy bother looking at the menu when we already know what you\u2019re going to get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could change my mind at the last second,\u201d I say. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance I could order a tuna melt or a turkey burger or a chef salad. I can be adventurous too, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Josh agrees, and I know he\u2019s just humoring me.</p><p>The server comes over to take our order and Josh says, \u201cI\u2019ll have a grilled cheese and a tomato soup and a chocolate milkshake.\u201d He looks at me expectantly. There\u2019s a smile coming up on the corners of his lips.</p><p>\u201cAh . . . um . . .\u201d I scan the menu as fast as I can, but I don\u2019t actually want a tuna melt or a turkey burger or a chef salad. I give up. I like what I like. \u201cA grilled cheese, please. And a black-cherry soda.\u201d As soon as the server is gone, I say, \u201cDon\u2019t say a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I wasn\u2019t going to.\u201d</p><p>And then, because there\u2019s a silence, we both speak at the same time. I say, \u201cHave you talked to Margot lately?\u201d and he says, \u201cHow are things going with Kavinsky?\u201d</p><p>Josh\u2019s easy smile fades and he looks away. \u201cYeah, we chat online sometimes. I think . . . I think she\u2019s kind of homesick.\u201d</p><p>I give him a funny look. \u201cI just talked to her last night and she didn\u2019t seem homesick at all. She seemed like the same old Margot. She was telling us about Raisin Weekend. It makes me want to go to Saint Andrews too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Raisin Weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a hundred percent sure . . . it sounds like it was a mix between drinking a lot and Latin. I guess it\u2019s a Scottish thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you do that?\u201d Josh asks. \u201cWould you go somewhere far away?\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cNo, probably not. That\u2019s Margot, not me. It\u2019d be nice to visit, though. Maybe my dad will let me go during spring break.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think she\u2019d like that a lot. I guess our Paris trip isn\u2019t happening anymore, huh?\u201d He laughs awkwardly, and then he clears his throat. \u201cSo wait, how are things going with Kavinsky?\u201d</p><p>Before I can answer, the server comes back with our food. Josh pushes the bowl of soup so it\u2019s in the middle of the table. \u201cFirst sip?\u201d he asks, holding up the milkshake.</p><p>Eagerly I nod and lean across the table. Josh holds the glass and I take a long sip. \u201cAhhh,\u201d I say, sitting back down.</p><p>\u201cThat was a pretty big sip,\u201d he says. \u201cHow come you never get your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I when I know you\u2019ll share?\u201d I break off a piece of grilled cheese and dip it into the soup.</p> <p>\u201cSo you were saying?\u201d Josh prods. When I stare at him blankly, he says, \u201cYou were about to talk about Kavinsky . . .\u201d</p><p>I was hoping this wouldn\u2019t come up. I\u2019m not in the mood to tell more lies to Josh. \u201cThings are good.\u201d Because Josh is looking at me like he\u2019s expecting something more, I add, \u201cHe\u2019s really sweet.\u201d</p><p>Josh snorts.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not what you\u2019d think. People are so quick to judge him, but he\u2019s different.\u201d I\u2019m surprised to find I\u2019m telling the truth. Peter isn\u2019t what you\u2019d think. He is cocky and he can be obnoxious and he\u2019s always late, true, but there are other good and surprising things about him too. \u201cHe\u2019s . . . not what you think.\u201d</p><p>Josh gives me a dubious look. Then he dunks half his sandwich into the soup and says, \u201cYou already said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s true.\u201d He shrugs at this like he doesn\u2019t believe me. So I say, \u201cYou should see the way Kitty acts around Peter. She\u2019s crazy about him.\u201d I don\u2019t realize it until the words are actually out of my mouth, but I say it to hurt him.</p> <p>Josh tears off a hunk of grilled cheese. \u201cWell, I hope she doesn\u2019t get too attached.\u201d Even though I\u2019ve had that exact same thought for different reasons, it still hurts to hear.</p><p>Suddenly the easy Josh-and\u2013Lara Jean feeling is lost. Josh is withdrawn and closed off, and I\u2019m stinging from what he said about Peter, and it feels like playacting to sit across from each other and pretend it\u2019s the same as the old days. How could it be, when Margot isn\u2019t here? She is the point of our little triangle.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Josh says suddenly. I look up. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that. That was a shitty thing to say.\u201d He ducks his head. \u201cI guess . . . I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m just jealous. I\u2019m not used to sharing the Song girls.\u201d</p><p>I go soft inside. Now that he\u2019s said this nice thing, I am feeling warm and generous toward him again. I don\u2019t say what I\u2019m thinking, which is, You may not be used to sharing us, but we\u2019re very used to sharing you. \u201cYou know Kitty still loves you best,\u201d I say, which makes him smile.</p><p>\u201cI mean, I did teach her how to hock a loogie,\u201d Josh says. \u201cYou don\u2019t forget the person who teaches you something like that.\u201d He takes a long sip of his milkshake. \u201cHey, they\u2019re doing a Lord of the Rings marathon at the Bess this weekend. Wanna go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s like . . . nine hours!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, nine hours of awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d I agree. \u201cI wanna go; I just have to check with Peter first. He said something about going to a movie this weekend, and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Josh cuts me off before I can finish. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I can just go with Mike. Or maybe I\u2019ll take Kitty. It\u2019s about time I introduced her to the genius that is Tolkien.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m quiet. Are Kitty and I interchangeable in his mind? Are Margot and I?</p><p>We\u2019re sharing a waffle when Genevieve walks into the diner with a little kid who I guess must be her little brother. Not her actual little brother; Gen is an only child. She\u2019s the president of the Little Sib program. It\u2019s where a high school student is paired up with an elementary school kid and you tutor them and take them out for fun days.</p><p>I slump down in my seat, but of course Gen still sees me. She looks from me to Josh, and then she gives me a little wave. I don\u2019t know what to do so I just wave back. Something about the way she\u2019s smiling at me is unsettling. It\u2019s how genuinely happy she looks.</p><p>If Genevieve is happy, that\u2019s not good for me.</p><p>At dinner I get a text from Peter. It says, If you\u2019re going to hang out with Sanderson, can you at least not do it in public?</p><p>Under the table I read it over and over. Could it be that Peter\u2019s the teensiest bit jealous? Or is he really just worried about how it looks to Genevieve?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you keep looking at?\u201d Kitty wants to know.</p><p>I put my phone down, facedown. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>Kitty turns to Daddy and says, \u201cI bet it was a text from Peter.\u201d</p><p>Buttering a roll, my dad says, \u201cI like Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d I say.</p><p>Daddy nods. \u201cHe\u2019s a good kid. He\u2019s really taken with you, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaken with me?\u201d I repeat.</p><p>To me Kitty says, \u201cYou sound like a parrot.\u201d To Daddy she says, \u201cWhat does that mean? Taken by her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means he\u2019s charmed by her,\u201d Daddy explains. \u201cHe\u2019s smitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what\u2019s smitten?\u201d</p><p>He chuckles and stuffs the roll in Kitty\u2019s open, perplexed mouth. \u201cIt means he likes her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe definitely likes her,\u201d Kitty agrees, her mouth full. \u201cHe . . . he looks at you a lot, Lara Jean. When you\u2019re not paying attention. He looks at you, to see if you\u2019re having a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does?\u201d My chest feels warm and glowy, and I can feel myself start to smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just happy to see you so happy. I used to worry about Margot taking on so many responsibilities at home and helping out the way she did. I didn\u2019t want her to miss out on her high school experience. But you know Margot. She\u2019s so driven.\u201d Daddy reaches over and squeezes my shoulder. \u201cTo see you now, going out and doing things and making new friends . . . it makes your old man very happy.

She knows exactly what she wants, and she\u2019ll do whatever it takes to get it. She\u2019s shameless that way.</p><p>I\u2019m going to talk to Daddy and help her cause. The two of us will wear him down. There\u2019ll be a puppy under our tree Christmas morning. I\u2019d bet money on it.</p> <p>49</p><p>THE NEXT NIGHT PETER AND I study at Starbucks for a few hours\u2014well, I study, and he keeps getting up and talking to people from school. On the way home he asks, \u201cDid you sign up for the ski trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m a terrible skier.\u201d Only cool people like Peter and his friends go on the ski trip. I could try to twist Chris\u2019s arm into going, but she\u2019d probably laugh in my face. She\u2019s not going on any school trip.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to ski. You can snowboard. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>I give him a look. \u201cCan you picture me snowboarding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll teach you. Come on, it\u2019ll be fun.\u201d Peter grabs my hand and says, \u201cPlease please please, Lara Jean? Come on, be a sport. It\u2019ll be fun, I promise.\u201d</p> <p>He catches me by surprise with this. The ski trip isn\u2019t until winter break. So he wants to keep this, us, up until then. For some reason I feel relieved.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to snowboard,\u201d he continues, \u201cthe lodge has a big stone fireplace and big comfy chairs. You can sit and read for hours. And they sell the best hot chocolate. I\u2019ll buy you one.\u201d He squeezes my hand.</p><p>My heart does a little zing, and I say, \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll go. But the hot chocolate had better be as good as you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you as many as you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you better bring a lot of singles,\u201d I say, and Peter snorts. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>When we get to my house, I climb out and he drives away before it occurs to me I left my bag on the floor of his car, and Daddy and Kitty aren\u2019t home. They\u2019re at Kitty\u2019s school for parent-teacher conferences.</p><p>I fumble around blindly under the deck, feeling around in the dark for the spare keys we keep hidden under the wheelbarrow. Then I remember that the spare keys are in the junk drawer, in the house, because I forgot to put them back the last time I got locked out. I have no keys, no phone, no way of getting into the house.</p> <p>Josh! Josh has a spare key. He\u2019s watered my dad\u2019s plants for him a few times when we went away on vacation.</p><p>I find a rock in the driveway and I cross the lawn and stand underneath Josh\u2019s window. I throw the rock at it and I miss. I find another one, and it pings off the glass, barely making a sound. I try again, with a bigger rock. This one hits.</p><p>Josh opens the window and leans his head out. \u201cHey. Did Kavinsky leave already?\u201d</p><p>Surprised, I say, \u201cYeah. I left my bag in his car. Can you throw down the spare keys?\u201d</p><p>Josh sighs, like I\u2019m asking for something huge. \u201cHold on.\u201d Then he disappears.</p><p>I stand there and wait for him to come back to the window, but he doesn\u2019t. He comes outside the front door instead. He\u2019s wearing a hoodie and sweatpants. It\u2019s Margot\u2019s favorite hoodie. When they first got together, she used to wear it all the time, like it was a letterman\u2019s jacket or something.</p><p>I hold my hand out for the keys and Josh drops them in my hand. \u201cThanks, Joshy.\u201d</p><p>I turn to leave, but he says, \u201cWait. I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>He sighs heavily and adjusts his glasses. He only wears his glasses at night. \u201cThis thing with Kavinsky . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that again. Josh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a player. He\u2019s not good enough for you. You\u2019re . . . innocent. You\u2019re not like other girls. He\u2019s a typical guy. You can\u2019t trust him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I know him a lot better than you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just looking out for you.\u201d Josh clears his throat. \u201cYou\u2019re like my little sister.\u201d</p><p>I want to hit him for saying that. \u201cNo I\u2019m not,\u201d I say.</p><p>An uneasy look crosses over Josh\u2019s face. I know what he\u2019s thinking, because we\u2019re both thinking it.</p><p>Then, headlights are beaming down our street. It\u2019s Peter\u2019s car. He\u2019s come back. I hand Josh his set of keys and run over to my driveway. Over my shoulder I call out, \u201cThanks, Joshy!\u201d</p><p>I come around the front to the driver\u2019s side. Peter\u2019s window is down. \u201cYou forgot your bag,\u201d he says, glancing over toward Josh\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say breathlessly. \u201cThanks for coming back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He was a minute ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen just in case,\u201d Peter says, and he leans his head out and kisses me on the lips, open-mouthed and sure.</p><p>I\u2019m stunned.</p><p>When he pulls away, Peter\u2019s smiling. \u201cNight, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>He drives off into the night and I\u2019m still standing there with my fingers to my lips. Peter Kavinsky just kissed me. He kissed me, and I liked it. I\u2019m pretty sure I liked it. I\u2019m pretty sure I like him.</p><p>The next morning I\u2019m at my locker, putting my books away, when I see Peter walking down the hallway. My heart thumps in my chest so loud I can hear it echo in my ears. He hasn\u2019t seen me yet. I duck my head into my locker and start arranging my books into a pile.</p><p>From behind the locker door he says, \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say back.</p><p>\u201cI just want to set your mind at ease, Covey. I\u2019m not going to kiss you again, so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p><p>So that\u2019s that. It doesn\u2019t matter if I like him or not, because he doesn\u2019t like me back. It\u2019s kind of silly to feel so disappointed about something you only just realized you wanted, isn\u2019t it?</p><p>Don\u2019t let him see that you\u2019re disappointed.</p><p>I face him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t worrying about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes you were. Look at you: your face is all pinched together like a clam.\u201d Peter laughs, and I try to unpinch my face, to look serene. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen again. It was all for Sanderson\u2019s benefit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he says, and he takes my hand, and he closes my locker door, and he walks me to class like a real boyfriend, like we\u2019re really in love.</p><p>How was I supposed to know what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not? It feels like I\u2019m the only one who doesn\u2019t know the difference.</p><p>50</p> <p>MY DAD\u2019S THRILLED WHEN I ask him to sign the permission slip. \u201cOh, Lara Jean, this is great. Did Peter convince you? You\u2019ve been scared of skiing ever since you were ten and you did the splits and you couldn\u2019t get back up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember.\u201d My boots froze onto the skis, and I lay there in the splits for what felt like days.</p><p>Signing the paper, my dad says, \u201cHey, maybe we can all of us go to Wintergreen over Christmas. Peter too.\u201d</p><p>So that\u2019s where I get it from. My dad. He lives in a fantasy world. Handing me the slip, he says cheerfully, \u201cYou can wear Margot\u2019s ski pants. Her gloves, too.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t tell him that I won\u2019t need them, because I\u2019ll be cozy in the lodge reading and sipping hot cocoa by the fire. I should bring my knitting stuff with me too.</p> <p>When I talk to Margot on the phone that night, I tell her I\u2019m going on the ski trip, and she\u2019s surprised. \u201cBut you hate skiing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to try out snowboarding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust . . . be careful,\u201d she says.</p><p>I\u2019m thinking she means on the slopes, but when Chris comes over the next night to borrow a dress, I learn otherwise. \u201cYou know everybody hooks up on the ski trip, right? It\u2019s like a school-sanctioned booty call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where I lost my V freshman year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you lost it in the woods near your house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. Whatever, the point is, I had sex on the ski trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are chaperones,\u201d I say worriedly. \u201cHow can people just have sex with chaperones around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChaperones go to sleep early because they\u2019re old,\u201d Chris says. \u201cPeople just sneak out. Plus there\u2019s a hot tub. Did you know that there\u2019s a hot tub?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo . . . Peter never mentioned that.\u201d Well, that\u2019s that, I just won\u2019t pack a bathing suit. It\u2019s not like they can make you go in a hot tub if you don\u2019t want to.</p><p>\u201cThe year I went, people were skinny-dipping.\u201d</p><p>My eyes bug out. Skinny-dipping! \u201cPeople were nude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the girls took their tops off. Just be prepared.\u201d Chris chews on her fingernail. \u201cLast year I heard Mr. Dunham got in the hot tub with students and it was weird.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis sounds like the Wild West,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cMore like Girls Gone Wild.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not that I\u2019m worried Peter will try something with me. I know he won\u2019t, because he doesn\u2019t see me that way. But are people going to expect it? Am I going to have to sneak into his room in the middle of the night so people think we\u2019re doing something? I don\u2019t want to get in trouble on a school trip, but Peter has a way of convincing me to do stuff I don\u2019t want to do.</p><p>I grab Chris\u2019s hands. \u201cWill you please come? Please, please!\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cYou know better than that. I don\u2019t do school trips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have before!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, freshman year. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I need you!\u201d Desperately I squeeze her hands and say, \u201cRemember how I covered for you last year when you went to Coachella? I spent the whole weekend sneaking in and out of your house so your mom would think you were at home! Don\u2019t forget the things I\u2019ve done for you, Chris! I need you now!\u201d</p><p>Unmoved, Chris plucks her hands away from mine and goes to the mirror and starts examining her skin. \u201cKavinsky\u2019s not going to pressure you to have sex if you don\u2019t want to. If you minus the fact that he dated the devil, he\u2019s not a total dummy. He\u2019s kind of decent, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by decent? Decent like he doesn\u2019t care that much about sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, no. He and Gen were in constant heat for each other. She\u2019s been on the pill longer than I have. Too bad everyone in my family thinks she\u2019s this angel.\u201d Chris pokes at a zit on her chin. \u201cWhat a fake. I should send an anonymous letter to our grandma . . . Not that I really would. I\u2019m no rat, unlike her. Remember that time she told our grandma I was going to school drunk?\u201d She doesn\u2019t wait for me to answer. When Chris gets going on a Genevieve rant, she is single-minded. \u201cMy grandma wanted to use the money she saved for my college for rehab! They had a family meeting about me! I\u2019m so glad you stole Kavinsky from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t steal him. They were already broken up!\u201d</p><p>Chris snorts. \u201cSure, keep telling that to yourself. Gen\u2019s going on the ski trip, you know. She\u2019s class president, so she\u2019s basically organizing it. So just beware. Don\u2019t ever ski alone.\u201d</p><p>I let out a gasp. \u201cChris, I\u2019m begging you. Please come.\u201d In a burst of inspiration I say, \u201cIf you come, it\u2019ll make Genevieve really mad! She\u2019s organizing this whole thing; it\u2019s her trip. She won\u2019t want you there!\u201d</p><p>Chris purses her lips into a smile. \u201cYou know how to play me.\u201d She juts her chin at me. \u201cDo you think this zit is ready to pop?\u201d</p><p>51</p><p>THANKSGIVING DAY, DADDY CLEANS OUT the turkey for me and then leaves to go pick up our Korean grandma, who lives an hour away in a retirement community with a lot of other Korean grandmas. Daddy\u2019s mom, Nana, is spending Thanksgiving with her boyfriend\u2019s family, which is fine by me, because I know she wouldn\u2019t have anything nice to say about the food.</p><p>I make up a green-bean dish with orange peel and dill, in an earnest effort to be jazzy and inventive. I nominate Kitty to be my taste tester and she takes a bite of green bean and says it tastes like an orange pickle. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we just have green-bean casserole with the fried onion rings that come in the can?\u201d Kitty ponders. She\u2019s cutting out different-colored feathers for her turkey place mats.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m trying to be jazzy and inventive,\u201d I say, dumping a can of gravy into the saucepan.</p><p>Doubtfully Kitty says, \u201cWell, are we still having broccoli casserole? People will eat that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see any broccoli anywhere in this kitchen?\u201d I ask. \u201cNo, the green in this meal is the green bean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about mashed potatoes? We\u2019re still having mashed potatoes, right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mashed potatoes. I jump up and check the pantry. I forgot to buy the potatoes. I got the whole milk and the butter and even the chives to put on top like Margot always does. But I forgot the actual potatoes. \u201cCall Daddy and ask him to pick up Yukon gold potatoes on the way home,\u201d I say, closing the pantry door.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you forgot the potatoes,\u201d Kitty says with a shake of her head.</p><p>I glare at her. \u201cJust focus on your place mats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because if I didn\u2019t just ask about the mashed potatoes, the meal would have been ruined, so you should be thanking me.\u201d</p> <p>Kitty gets up to call Daddy, and I yell out, \u201cBy the way, those turkeys look more like the NBC peacock logo than actual turkeys, so!\u201d</p><p>Kitty is unfazed, and I take another bite of the green beans. They do taste like an orange pickle.</p><p>It turns out I have cooked the turkey upside down. Also, Kitty kept hounding me about salmonella because she watched a video on it in science, so I wind up leaving the bird in too long. The mashed potatoes are fine, but there are some crunchy bits here and there because I rushed to boil them.</p><p>We are seated around the dining room table, and Kitty\u2019s place mats really do add a certain something.</p><p>Grandma is eating a whole pile of green beans, and I shoot Kitty a triumphant look. See? Someone likes them.</p> <p>There was a minute or two, after Mommy died, when Grandma moved in to help take care of us. There was even talk of her staying. She didn\u2019t think Daddy could manage on his own.</p><p>\u201cSo, Danny,\u201d Grandma begins. Kitty and I exchange a look across the table, because we know what\u2019s coming. \u201cAre you seeing anyone these days? Going on dates?\u201d</p><p>My dad reddens. \u201cEr . . . not so much. My work keeps me so busy . . .\u201d</p><p>Grandma clucks. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for a man to be alone, Danny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got my girls to keep me company,\u201d my dad says, trying to sound jovial and not tense.</p><p>Grandma fixes him with a cold stare. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean.\u201d</p> <p>When we\u2019re doing the dishes, Grandma asks me, \u201cLara Jean, would you mind if your daddy had a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s something Margot and I have discussed at length over the years, most often in the dark, late at night. If Daddy absolutely had to date, what kind of woman would we like to see him with? Someone with a good sense of humor, kindhearted, all of the usual things. Someone who\u2019d be firm with Kitty but not rein her in so much that it would squash all the special things about her. But also someone who wouldn\u2019t try to be our mother; that\u2019s what Margot is fiercest about. Kitty needs a mom, but we\u2019re old enough to not need mothering, she says.</p><p>Of the three of us, Margot would be the most critical. She\u2019s incredibly loyal to Mommy\u2019s memory. Not that I\u2019m not, but there have been times, over the years, where I\u2019ve thought how it would be nice to have someone. Someone older, a lady, who knows about certain things, like the right way to put on blush, or how to flirt to get out of a speeding ticket. Things to know for the future. But then it never happened. Daddy\u2019s been on some dates, but he hasn\u2019t had a steady girlfriend he\u2019s brought around. Which has always been sort of a relief, but now that I\u2019m getting older, I keep thinking about what it will be like when I\u2019m gone and it\u2019s just Kitty and Daddy, and then before long it will just be Daddy. I don\u2019t want him to be alone.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind at all.\u201d</p><p>Grandma gives me an approving look. \u201cGood girl,\u201d she says, and I feel warm and cozy inside, like how I used to feel after a cup of the Night-Night tea Mommy used to make me when I couldn\u2019t fall asleep at night. Daddy\u2019s made it for me a few times since, but it never tasted the same, and I never had the heart to tell him.</p><p>52</p><p>THE CHRISTMAS COOKIE BONANZA STARTS December first. We drag out all of Mommy\u2019s old cookbooks and cooking magazines and we spread them out on the living room floor and turn on the Charlie Brown Christmas album. No Christmas music is allowed in our house until December first. I don\u2019t remember whose rule this is, but we abide by it. Kitty keeps a list of which cookies we\u2019re definitely doing and which ones we\u2019re maybe doing. There are a few perennials. My dad loves pecan crescents, so those are a must. Sugar cookies, because those are a given. Snickerdoodles for Kitty, molasses cookies for Margot, cowgirl cookies for me. White-chocolate cranberry are Josh\u2019s favorite. I think this year, though, we should mix things up and do different cookies. Not entirely, but at least a few new ones.</p><p>Peter\u2019s here; he stopped by after school to work on chem, and now it\u2019s hours later and he\u2019s still here. He and Kitty and I are in the living room going through the cookbooks. My dad\u2019s in the kitchen listening to NPR and making tomorrow\u2019s lunches.</p> <p>\u201cPlease no more turkey sandwiches,\u201d I call out.</p><p>Peter nudges my sock and mouths spoiled, and he points at me and Kitty, shaking his finger at us. \u201cWhatever. Your mom makes your lunches every day, so shut it,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>My dad calls back, \u201cHey, I\u2019m sick of leftovers too, but what are we going to do? Throw it away?\u201d</p><p>Kitty and I look at each other. \u201cPretty much exactly,\u201d I say. My dad has a thing about wasting food. I wonder if I snuck down to the kitchen tonight and threw it out, if he\u2019d notice. He probably would.</p><p>\u201cIf we had a dog,\u201d Kitty pipes up loudly, \u201cthere wouldn\u2019t be any more leftovers.\u201d She winks at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of dog do you want?\u201d Peter asks her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get her hopes up,\u201d I tell him, but he waves me off.</p><p>Immediately Kitty says, \u201cAn Akita. Red fur with a cinnamon-bun tail. Or a German shepherd I can train to be a seeing-eye dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not blind,\u201d Peter says.</p><p>\u201cBut I could be one day.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Peter shakes his head. He nudges me again and in an admiring voice he says, \u201cCan\u2019t argue with the kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much futile,\u201d I agree. I hold up a magazine to show Kitty. \u201cWhat do you think? Creamsicle cookies?\u201d Kitty writes them down as a maybe.</p><p>\u201cHey, what about these?\u201d Peter pushes a cookbook in my lap. It\u2019s opened up to a fruitcake cookie recipe.</p><p>I gag. \u201cAre you kidding? You\u2019re kidding, right? Fruitcake cookies? That\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen done right, fruitcake can be really good,\u201d Peter defends. \u201cMy great-aunt Trish used to make fruitcake, and she\u2019d put ice cream on top and it was awesome.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you put ice cream on anything, it\u2019s good,\u201d Kitty says.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t argue with the kid,\u201d I say, and Peter and I exchange smiles over Kitty\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cPoint taken, but this isn\u2019t your average fruitcake. It\u2019s not, like, a wet loaf of neon jujubes. It\u2019s got pecans and dried cherries and blueberries and good stuff. I think she called it Christmas Memory fruitcake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love that story!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cThat\u2019s my favorite. It\u2019s so good but so sad.\u201d</p> <p>Peter looks puzzled and so does Kitty so I explain. \u201c?\u2018A Christmas Memory\u2019 is a short story by Truman Capote. It\u2019s about a boy named Buddy and his older lady cousin who took care of him when he was little. They\u2019d save up all year to buy ingredients for fruitcake and then they\u2019d send them as presents to friends, but also to, like, the president.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it so sad?\u201d Kitty wants to know.</p><p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re best friends and they love each other more than anybody, but they get separated in the end, because the family thinks she doesn\u2019t take good enough care of him. And maybe she doesn\u2019t, but maybe it doesn\u2019t matter, because she was still his soul mate. In the end she dies, and Buddy doesn\u2019t even get to say good-bye to her. And, it\u2019s a true story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s depressing,\u201d Peter says. \u201cForget the fruitcake cookies.\u201d</p><p>Kitty crosses out fruitcake cookies on her pad.</p> <p>I\u2019m thumbing through an old Good Housekeeping magazine when the doorbell rings. Kitty scrambles up and runs for the door. \u201cCheck who it is before you open it,\u201d I call after her. She\u2019s always forgetting to check first.</p><p>\u201cJosh!\u201d I hear her squeal.</p><p>Peter\u2019s head jerks up.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here to see Kitty,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>Josh walks into the living room with Kitty hanging around his neck like a monkey. \u201cHey,\u201d he says, eyes flickering in Peter\u2019s direction.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, man,\u201d Peter says, friendly as can be. \u201cHave a seat.\u201d</p><p>I give him a strange look. Just a second ago he was grousing, and now he\u2019s happy as a clam. I don\u2019t get boys.</p><p>Josh holds up a plastic bag. \u201cI brought back your casserole dish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that Josh?\u201d my dad calls from the kitchen. \u201cJosh, do you want a snack? Turkey sandwich?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m positive he\u2019s going to say no, because I\u2019m sure he\u2019s had as many leftover turkey sandwiches over at his house as we\u2019ve been eating over here, but then he goes, \u201cSure!\u201d Josh disentangles himself from Kitty and plops down on the couch. To me he says, \u201cChristmas Cookie Bonanza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristmas Cookie Bonanza,\u201d I confirm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making my favorite, right?\u201d Josh gives me puppy-dog eyes, which always makes me laugh, because it\u2019s so un-Josh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a dork,\u201d I say, shaking my head.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite?\u201d Peter asks him. \u201cBecause I think the list is pretty set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s already on the list,\u201d Josh says.</p><p>I look from Josh to Peter. I can\u2019t tell if they\u2019re kidding or not.</p><p>Peter reaches out and tickles Kitty\u2019s feet. \u201cRead us the list, Katherine.\u201d</p><p>Kitty giggles and rolls over to her notepad. Then she stands up and grandly says, \u201cM&amp;M cookies are a yes, cappuccino cookies are a maybe, Creamsicle cookies are a maybe, fruitcake cookies are a no way\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute, I\u2019m a part of this council too,\u201d Peter objects, \u201cand you guys just turned down my fruitcake cookies without a second thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said to forget the fruitcake cookies, like, five seconds ago!\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWell, now I want them back under consideration,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you don\u2019t have the votes,\u201d I tell him. \u201cKitty and I both vote no, so that\u2019s two against one.\u201d</p><p>My dad pops his head into the living room. \u201cPut me down as a yes vote for the fruitcake cookies.\u201d His head disappears back into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Dr. Covey,\u201d Peter crows. He drags me closer to him. \u201cSee, I knew your dad was on my side.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re such a suck-up!\u201d</p><p>And then I look over at Josh, and he is staring at us with a funny, left-out look on his face. It makes me feel bad, that look. I scoot away from Peter and start flipping through my books again. I tell him, \u201cThe list is still a work in progress. The cookie council will strongly consider your white-chocolate cranberry cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreatly appreciated,\u201d Josh says. \u201cChristmas isn\u2019t Christmas without your white-chocolate cranberry cookies.\u201d</p><p>Kitty pipes up, \u201cHey, Josh, you\u2019re a suck-up too.\u201d Josh grabs her and tickles her until she\u2019s laughing so hard she has tears in her eyes.</p><p>After Josh leaves and Kitty goes upstairs to watch TV, I\u2019m tidying up the living room and Peter\u2019s sprawled out on the couch watching me. I keep thinking he\u2019s about to leave, but then he keeps lingering.</p><p>Out of nowhere he says, \u201cRemember back at Halloween how you were Cho Chang and Sanderson was Harry Potter? I bet you that wasn\u2019t a coincidence. I bet you a million bucks he got Kitty to find out what your costume was and then he ran out and bought a Harry Potter costume. The kid is into you.\u201d</p><p>I freeze. \u201cNo, he isn\u2019t. He loves my sister. He always has and he always will.\u201d</p><p>Peter waves this off. \u201cJust you wait. As soon as you and I are done, he\u2019s gonna pull some cheesy-ass move and, like, profess his love for you with a boom box. I\u2019m telling you, I know how guys think.\u201d</p><p>I yank away the pillow he\u2019s got cushioning his back and put it on the recliner. \u201cMy sister will be home for winter break soon. I bet you a million dollars they get back together.\u201d</p><p>Peter holds his hand out for me to shake on it, and when I take it, he pulls me onto the couch next to him. Our legs touch. He has a mischievous glint in his eye, and I think maybe he\u2019s going to kiss me, and I\u2019m scared, but I\u2019m excited, too. But then I hear Kitty\u2019s footsteps coming down the stairs, and the moment\u2019s over.</p><p>53</p><p>\u201cCAN WE PUT UP THE tree this weekend?\u201d Kitty asks at breakfast.</p><p>My dad looks up from his bowl of oatmeal. Oatmeal, ugh. \u201cI don\u2019t see why not.\u201d</p><p>Halfheartedly I say, \u201cMargot might be mad if we do it without her.\u201d Truth be told, I want to put up the tree too. It\u2019s so cozy to do Christmas Cookie Bonanza and have the lights twinkling on the tree and Christmas music and the whole house smelling like sugar and butter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBrielle\u2019s family put their tree up the day after Thanksgiving,\u201d Kitty says.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just do it, then,\u201d I say. \u201cCan we, Daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if Brielle\u2019s family is doing it,\u201d Daddy says.</p><p>We drive out to the Christmas tree farm an hour away, because that\u2019s where the really nice ones are. Kitty insists on seeing each and every tree to make sure ours is the best one. I vote for a plump balsam fir because it smells the best, but Kitty doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s tall enough. We go for a Douglas fir instead, and the whole drive home the air smells like Christmas morning.</p> <p>Josh runs out of his house when he sees us struggling to get the tree inside. He and my dad heft it up and take it inside the house. He holds the tree up straight as my dad screws the Christmas tree stand around it tight. I have a feeling like he\u2019s going to want to stay and help decorate the tree. I can\u2019t stop thinking about what Peter said. How Josh could maybe like me.</p><p>\u201cA little to the left,\u201d Kitty directs. \u201cIt\u2019s not straight enough.\u201d</p><p>I bring down the box with the twinkle lights and the ornaments and start sorting through them. My favorite is the painted blue star I made in kindergarten out of dough. It\u2019s my favorite because there\u2019s a bite taken out of it\u2014I told Kitty it was a cookie and she chomped right into it like the Cookie Monster. And then she cried, and I got in trouble, but it was worth it. \u201cShould we do colored lights or white lights this year?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWhite,\u201d Kitty says. \u201cIt\u2019s classier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut colored lights are whimsical,\u201d Josh argues. \u201cI mean, they\u2019re nostalgic.\u201d</p> <p>I roll my eyes. \u201cWhimsical, Josh?\u201d And then Josh proceeds to make a case for colored lights, and he and I argue back and forth until Daddy intercedes and says we should just do half and half. This is when things finally feel really and truly normal between us, now that we are bickering again like old times. Peter was wrong about Josh.</p><p>The tree is so tall it nearly touches the ceiling. We run out of lights, so Daddy goes to buy more at the store. Josh puts Kitty on his shoulders so she can put the star on the tippy top.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad we got a big tree this year,\u201d I say with a happy sigh, falling back onto the sofa and looking up at the top. There\u2019s nothing cozier than a Christmas tree all lit up.</p><p>A little later, Daddy has to go in to the hospital, and Kitty goes over to our neighbor\u2019s house because they\u2019re making s\u2019mores in the fireplace, so it\u2019s just Josh and me cleaning up. I\u2019m putting ornament hooks back into their different ziplock bags and Josh is loading up a cardboard box with the ornaments we didn\u2019t have room for. He hoists the box in his arms and bumps into a branch on the tree, and a glass ornament slips off and breaks.</p><p>Josh groans.</p><p>\u201cJo-osh,\u201d I say. \u201cI made that in home ec.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It wasn\u2019t my best work anyway. I put in too many feathers.\u201d It\u2019s a clear glass ball with white feathers and white sequins inside.</p><p>I go get a broom, and when I come back, he says, \u201cYou act different around Kavinsky. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>I look up from sweeping the broken ornament. \u201cNo I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t act like you. You act like . . . like how all girls act around him. That\u2019s not you, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>Annoyed, I say, \u201cI act the same as I always do. What would you know about it, Josh? You\u2019ve barely ever even been around us.\u201d I crouch down and pick up a shard of glass.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d Josh says. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d He stoops down next to me and reaches for another shard. \u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou be careful!\u201d I lean close to him and try to get a closer look at his finger. \u201cAre you bleeding?\u201d</p> <p>He shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d And then he says, \u201cYou know what I don\u2019t get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Josh stares at me, his cheeks a dull red. \u201cWhy you never said anything. If all that time you felt like that about me, why didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d</p><p>My whole body goes stiff. I wasn\u2019t expecting that. I\u2019m not prepared. I swallow hard and say, \u201cYou were with Margot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t always with Margot. The stuff you wrote\u2014you liked me before I ever liked her. Why didn\u2019t you just tell me?\u201d</p><p>I let out a breath. \u201cWhat does that even matter now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt matters. You should have told me. You should have at least given me a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have made a difference, Josh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you it would have!\u201d He steps toward me.</p><p>Jerkily I rise to my feet. Why is he bringing this up now, just when things are back to normal again? \u201cYou\u2019re so full of it. You\u2019ve never thought of me that way, not ever, so don\u2019t go trying to reinvent history now when I have somebody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I think,\u201d he snaps. \u201cYou don\u2019t know my every thought, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes I do. I know you better than anyone. You know why? You\u2019re predictable. Everything you do. It\u2019s so predictable. The only reason you\u2019re even saying this now is because you\u2019re jealous. And it\u2019s not even because of me. You don\u2019t care about who I\u2019m with. You\u2019re just jealous that Peter took your spot. Kitty likes him better than you now too.\u201d</p><p>His face darkens. He glares at me and I glare back. \u201cFine!\u201d he yells. \u201cI\u2019m jealous! Are you happy now?\u201d</p><p>And then he jerks his head toward mine, and he kisses me. On the lips. His eyes are closed, mine are wide open. And then mine close too, and for a second, just for a second, I kiss him back. Then I break away. I push him off.</p><p>Triumphantly he says, \u201cDid you predict that, Lara Jean?\u201d</p><p>My mouth opens and closes, but no words come out. I drop the broom and run up the stairs, as fast as I can. I run all the way to my room and lock my door behind me. Josh just kissed me. In my living room. My sister is coming back in a few weeks. And I have a fake boyfriend I just cheated on.</p><p>54</p><p>AFTER THIRD PERIOD, LUCAS IS waiting for me.</p><p>He\u2019s wearing a skinny tie today with a V-neck and he has a full-size bag of Cheetos in his hand. He stuffs a handful of Cheetos into his mouth, and orange dust floats onto his white V-neck. The corners of his mouth look slightly orange too. With his mouth full he says, \u201cLook, there\u2019s something I need to tell you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I laugh. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I ever thought you were so refined,\u201d I say, blowing Cheetos powder off his shirt. \u201cWhat do you need to tell me?\u201d I ask. I steal a few Cheetos out of the bag. When he hesitates, I say, \u201cLucas, I hate when people say that they have something to tell you and they don\u2019t just say it. It\u2019s like when people say they have a funny story\u2014like, just hurry up and tell the story and I\u2019ll decide for myself if I think it\u2019s funny or not.\u201d</p><p>Lucas licks cheese off his lips. \u201cWell, you know I live in the same neighborhood as Genevieve, right?\u201d I nod. \u201cLast night I saw Kavinsky leaving her house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That\u2019s all I say. Just \u201coh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormally I wouldn\u2019t think it was that big of a deal, but there\u2019s one other thing.\u201d Lucas wipes his mouth off with the back of his hand. \u201cGenevieve and her college guy broke up over the weekend. You know what that means, right?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m nodding but I\u2019m numb inside. \u201cYes. . . . Wait, what?\u201d</p><p>Lucas gives me a look that\u2019s half pitying, half impatient. \u201cShe\u2019s going to try to get Peter back, Lara Jean!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, and I feel a pang even as I\u2019m saying it. \u201cOf course she will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let her,\u201d he warns.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I say, and the words come out soft like jelly, without any conviction at all.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know it until now but I think maybe I\u2019ve been counting down to this moment all along. For Genevieve to want Peter back. For Peter to figure out this whole thing has been a zany little detour and now it\u2019s time for him to go back where he belongs. To the person he belongs to.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t planning on telling Peter a thing about Josh kissing me. I really wasn\u2019t. But then, as Lucas and I are walking together, I see him and Genevieve walking down the hallway. Lucas gives me a meaningful look, which I pretend not to see.</p><p>In chemistry class I write Peter a note.</p><p>You were right about Josh.</p><p>I tap him on the back and slip the note in his hand. When he reads it, he sits up straight and immediately scrawls something back.</p><p>Be more specific.</p> <p>He kissed me.</p><p>When Peter stiffens, I am ashamed to say that I feel a little bit vindicated. I wait for him to write back, but he doesn\u2019t. As soon as the bell rings, he turns around and says, \u201cWhat the hell? How did that even happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came over to help us trim the tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what? He kissed you in front of Kitty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! It was just the two of us at the house.\u201d</p><p>Peter looks really irritated, and I\u2019m starting to regret mentioning it. \u201cWhat the hell is he thinking, kissing my girlfriend? It\u2019s fucking ridiculous. I\u2019m gonna say something to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what? No!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to, Lara Jean. He can\u2019t just get away with it.\u201d</p> <p>I stand up and start packing up my bag. \u201cYou\u2019d better not say anything to him, Peter. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>Peter watches me silently. And then he asks, \u201cDid you kiss him back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d</p><p>He looks taken aback. \u201cAre you mad at me for something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I will be if you say anything to Josh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say back.</p><p>55</p><p>I HAVEN\u2019T SEEN JOSH SINCE he kissed me, but when I get home that night from studying at the library, he is sitting on the front porch in his navy parka, waiting for me. The lights are on in the house; my dad is home. Kitty\u2019s bedroom light is on. I\u2019d rather go on avoiding Josh, but here he is, at my house.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says. \u201cCan I talk to you?\u201d</p><p>I sit down next to him and look straight ahead, across the street. Ms. Rothschild\u2019s put her Christmas tree up too. She always puts it by the window near the door so people can see it from the outside.</p><p>\u201cWe have to figure out what we\u2019re going to do before Margot gets here. It was my fault what happened. I should be the one to tell her.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him in disbelief. \u201cTell her? Are you nuts? We\u2019re never telling Margot because there\u2019s nothing to tell.\u201d</p><p>He juts his chin out. \u201cI don\u2019t want to keep a secret from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have thought of that before you kissed me!\u201d I hiss. \u201cAnd for the record, if anybody was going to tell her, it would be me. I\u2019m her sister. You were just her boyfriend. And you\u2019re not even that anymore, so . . .\u201d</p><p>Hurt flashes across his face and it stays there. \u201cI was never just Margot\u2019s boyfriend. This is weird for me, too, you know. It\u2019s like, ever since I got that letter . . .\u201d He hesitates. \u201cForget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust say it,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cEver since I got that letter, things have been messed up between us. It\u2019s not fair. You got to say everything you wanted to say, and I\u2019m the one who has to rearrange the way I think about you; I have to make sense of it in my head. You totally blindsided me, and then you just shut me out. You start dating Kavinsky, you stop being my friend.\u201d He exhales. \u201cEver since I got your letter . . . I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about you.\u201d</p><p>Whatever I was expecting him to say, it wasn\u2019t that. It definitely wasn\u2019t that. \u201cJosh . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t want to hear it, but just let me say what I need to say, okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cI hate that you\u2019re with Kavinsky. I hate it. He\u2019s not good enough for you. I\u2019m sorry to say it, but he\u2019s just not. In my opinion, no guy will ever be good enough for you. Least of all me.\u201d Josh ducks his head, and then suddenly he looks up at me and says, \u201cThere was this one time, I guess it was a couple of summers ago. We were walking home from somebody\u2019s house\u2014I think it was Mike\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>It was hot, around dusk. I was mad because Mike\u2019s older brother Jimmy had said he\u2019d give us a ride home, and then he went somewhere and didn\u2019t come back, so we had to walk. I was wearing espadrilles and my feet were hurting something terrible. Josh kept telling me to keep up with him.</p><p>Quietly he says, \u201cIt was just me and you. You had on that tan suede fringy shirt you used to wear, with the straps, and it showed your belly button.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Pocahontas-meets-seventies-Cher-style shirt.\u201d Oh, how I loved that shirt.</p><p>\u201cI almost kissed you that day. I thought about it. It was this weird impulse I had. I just wanted to see what it would be like.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My heart stops. \u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then I don\u2019t know. I guess I forgot about it.\u201d</p><p>I let out a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you got that letter. You were never supposed to see that. It wasn\u2019t meant for you to ever read. It was just for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was fate. Maybe this was all supposed to happen just like this, because . . . because it was always gonna be you and me.\u201d</p> <p>I say the first thing that comes to mind. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t.\u201d And I realize it\u2019s true.</p><p>This is the moment I realize I don\u2019t love him, that I haven\u2019t for a while. That maybe I never did. Because he\u2019s right there for the taking: I could kiss him again; I could make him mine. But I don\u2019t want him. I want someone else. It feels strange to have spent so much time wishing for something, for someone, and then one day, suddenly, to just stop.</p><p>I tuck my fingers inside my jacket sleeves. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell Margot. You have to promise me, Josh.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly he nods.</p><p>\u201cHas Margot been in touch with you recently?\u201d I ask him.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. She called the other night. She said she wants to hang out while she\u2019s home. She wants to go to DC for the day. Go to the Smithsonian, get dinner in Chinatown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Then that\u2019s what you\u2019ll do.\u201d I pat him on the knee and then quickly take my hand back. \u201cJosh, we just have to act like before. Like always. If we do that, everything will be fine.\u201d I repeat it to myself in my head. Everything will be fine. We\u2019ll all go back to our proper places now. Josh and Margot. Me. Peter.</p><p>56</p><p>AFTER SCHOOL LETS OUT THE next day, I go look for Peter in the weight room. He\u2019s sitting at the bench press. I think it\u2019s better to talk here and not in his car. I\u2019m going to miss riding around in his car. It was starting to feel like home. I\u2019m going to miss being somebody\u2019s pretend girlfriend. Not just somebody\u2019s\u2014Peter\u2019s. I\u2019ve gotten to really like Darrell and Gabe and the other lax guys. They aren\u2019t as douchey as people say. They\u2019re good people.</p><p>The weight room is empty except for Peter. He\u2019s at the bench press, lifting weights. When he sees me, he smiles. \u201cAre you here to spot me?\u201d He sits up and wipes sweat off his face with the collar of his T-shirt.</p><p>My heart squeezes painfully. \u201cI\u2019m here to break up. To fake break up, I mean.\u201d</p> <p>Peter does a double take. \u201cWait. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to keep it going. You got what you wanted, right? You saved face, and so did I. I talked to Josh, and everything\u2019s back to normal with us again. And my sister will be home soon. So . . . mission accomplished.\u201d</p><p>Slowly he nods. \u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d</p><p>My heart is breaking even as I smile. \u201cSo okay, then.\u201d With a flourish I whip our contract out of my bag. \u201cNull and void. Both parties have hereby fulfilled their obligations to each other in perpetuity.\u201d I\u2019m just rattling off lawyer words.</p><p>\u201cYou carry that around with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! Kitty\u2019s such a snoop. She\u2019d find it in two seconds.\u201d</p><p>I hold up the piece of paper, poised to rip it in half, but Peter grabs it from me. \u201cWait! What about the ski trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re still coming, right?\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t thought of that. The only reason I was going to go was for Peter. I can\u2019t go now. I can\u2019t be a witness to Peter and Genevieve\u2019s reunion, I just can\u2019t. I want them to come back from the trip magically together again, and it will be like this whole thing was just something I dreamed up. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widen. \u201cCome on, Covey! Don\u2019t bail on me now. We already signed up and gave the deposits and everything. Let\u2019s just go, and have that be our final hurrah.\u201d When I start to protest, Peter shakes his head. \u201cYou\u2019re going, so take this contract back.\u201d Peter refolds it and carefully puts it back in my bag.</p><p>Why is it so hard to say no to him? Is this what it\u2019s like to be in love with somebody?</p><p>57</p><p>I GET THE IDEA DURING the morning announcements, when they announce that our school\u2019s hosting a Model UN scrimmage this weekend. John Ambrose McClaren was the middle school Model UN president. I wonder if he\u2019s on his school\u2019s team.</p><p>I bring it up to Peter at lunch, before any of the guys sit down. \u201cDo you know if John McClaren still does Model UN?\u201d</p><p>He gives me a funny look. \u201cHow should I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I was just wondering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think maybe I\u2019m going to go to the Model UN scrimmage this weekend. I have a feeling that he\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor real?\u201d Peter hoots. \u201cIf he is, what are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t figured that part out yet. Maybe I\u2019ll go up to him, maybe I won\u2019t. I just want to see how he turned out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can look him up online right now and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, that would be cheating. I want to see him with my own eyes. I want to be surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t bother asking me to go and keep you company. I\u2019m not going to waste a whole Saturday on Model UN.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on asking you to go.\u201d</p><p>Peter throws me a hurt look. \u201cWhat? Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just something I want to do by myself.\u201d</p><p>Peter lets out a low whistle. \u201cWow. The body ain\u2019t even cold yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a little player, Covey. We aren\u2019t even broken up yet and you\u2019re already trying to talk to other guys. I would be hurt if I wasn\u2019t impressed.\u201d</p><p>This makes me smile.</p><p>In eighth grade I kissed John McClaren at a party. It wasn\u2019t a romantic kiss. It was a barely anything kiss. We were playing spin the bottle, and when it was his turn, I held my breath and prayed the bottle would land on me. And it did! It almost landed on Angie Powell, but luck was on my side that day, and he was mine by half an inch. I tried to keep my face very still and robotic so I wouldn\u2019t smile. John and I crawled into the center and we did this very quick chicken peck, and everybody groaned, and his face was red. I was disappointed; I think maybe I\u2019d expected something more, a kiss with more weight to it. More va-va-va-voom. More zsa zsa zsu. But that was it. Maybe I\u2019ll get a second chance. Maybe it\u2019ll make me forget Peter.</p><p>58</p><p>AS I WALK INTO SCHOOL on saturday morning, I go over what I\u2019m going to say. Maybe just, Hey, John, how are you? It\u2019s Lara Jean. I haven\u2019t seen him since the eighth grade. What if he doesn\u2019t recognize me? What if he doesn\u2019t even remember me? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I scan the sandwich boards in the lobby and I find John\u2019s name under General Assembly. He\u2019s representing the People\u2019s Republic of China.</p><p>The General Assembly is meeting in the auditorium. There are desks set up for each delegate, and onstage there is a podium where a girl in a black suit is making a speech about nuclear nonproliferation. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll just slip in the back and sit and watch but there\u2019s nowhere to sit, so I just stand at the back of the room with my arms crossed and look for John. There are so many people here, and everybody\u2019s facing the front, so it\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s what.</p><p>A kid in a navy suit turns around and looks at me and whispers, \u201cAre you a page?\u201d He\u2019s holding up a folded piece of paper.</p><p>\u201cUm . . .\u201d I\u2019m not sure what a page is, and then I see a girl hustling around the room delivering notes to people.</p> <p>The boy thrusts the piece of paper at me and turns back around and scribbles in his notebook. The note is addressed to Brazil, from France. So I guess I\u2019m a page.</p><p>The tables aren\u2019t in alphabetical order, so I just start wandering around trying to find Brazil. I finally find Brazil, a guy in a bow tie, and other people are raising their hands with notes for me to deliver. Before long I\u2019m hustling too.</p><p>From behind I see a boy\u2019s hand raised for me to pick up his note, so I hurry forward, and then he turns his head just slightly. And oh my God, it\u2019s John Ambrose McClaren, delegate from the People\u2019s Republic of China, a few feet away from me.</p><p>He has sandy hair, clean-cut. His cheeks are rosy, just the way I remember. They still have that fresh-scrubbed wholesomeness that makes him look young. He\u2019s wearing khakis and a light blue button-down with a navy crew-neck sweater. He looks serious, focused, like he\u2019s a real delegate and this isn\u2019t pretend.</p><p>Honestly, he looks just the way I imagined he\u2019d grow up to look.</p> <p>John\u2019s holding the piece of paper out for me as he takes notes with his head down. I reach for it; my fingers close around the paper, and then he looks up and does a double take.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I whisper. We\u2019re both still holding on to the note.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says back. He blinks, and then he lets go of the paper, and I hurry away, my heart pounding in my ears. I hear him call out my name in a loud whisper, but I don\u2019t slow down.</p><p>I look down at the paper. His handwriting is neat, precise. I go deliver his note to the USA, and then I ignore Great Britain, who is waving a note at me, and I walk right out the auditorium double doors and into the afternoon light.</p><p>I just saw John McClaren. After all these years, I finally saw him. And he knew me. Right away he knew who I was.</p><p>I get a text from Peter around lunchtime.</p> <p>Did you see McClaren?</p><p>I type back yes, but then I delete it before I hit send. I write back no instead. I\u2019m not sure why I do it. I think maybe I just want to keep it for myself, and be happy just knowing that John remembered me, and have that be enough.</p><p>59</p><p>WE ALL GO TO PICK up margot from the airport. Kitty\u2019s made a sign that says Welcome Home Gogo. I keep my eyes peeled for her, and when she comes out I almost don\u2019t recognize her for a second\u2014her hair is short! It\u2019s cut in a bob! When Margot sees us, she waves, and Kitty drops her sign and runs toward her. Then we\u2019re all hugging and Daddy has tears in his eyes. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Margot says to me, and I know she means her hair.</p><p>\u201cIt makes you look older,\u201d I lie, and Margot beams. If anything it makes her look younger, but I knew she wouldn\u2019t want to hear that.</p><p>On the way home, Margot makes Daddy pull over at Clouds for a cheeseburger, even though she says she isn\u2019t hungry. \u201cI\u2019ve missed this so much,\u201d she says, but she only has a few bites and Kitty has the rest.</p><p>I\u2019m excited to show Margot all the cookies we made, but when I take her into the dining room and show her all the tins, she frowns. \u201cYou guys did the Christmas Cookie Bonanza without me?\u201d</p><p>I feel a little bit guilty, but I honestly didn\u2019t think Margot would mind. I mean, she was in Scotland, doing way more fun stuff than baking cookies, for Pete\u2019s sake. \u201cWell, yeah. We kind of had to. School ends tomorrow. If we\u2019d waited for you, we wouldn\u2019t have had time. We saved half the dough in the freezer, though, so you can still help us bake the rest for the neighbors.\u201d I open the big blue tin so she can see the cookies layered and lined up in rows. I\u2019m proud of how they are the same size and height. \u201cWe did some new cookies this year. Try an orange Creamsicle; it\u2019s really good.\u201d</p> <p>Margot picks through the tin and frowns. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do molasses cookies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this year . . . We decided to do orange Creamsicle cookies in their place.\u201d She picks one up and I watch her bite into it. \u201cGood, right?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cMm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose were Kitty\u2019s pick.\u201d</p><p>Margot glances toward the living room. \u201cWhen did you guys do the tree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitty couldn\u2019t wait,\u201d I say, and it sounds like an excuse, but it\u2019s true. I try not to sound defensive as I add, \u201cI think it\u2019ll be nice to enjoy the tree for as long as we can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when did you put it up?\u201d</p><p>Slowly I say, \u201cA couple of weeks ago . . .\u201d Why is she in such a bad mood?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so long ago. It\u2019ll probably be dried out by Christmas Day.\u201d Margot walks over to the tree and moves the wooden owl ornament to a different branch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been watering it every day and putting in Sprite like Grandma taught us.\u201d</p><p>Somehow this feels like a fight, and we never fight.</p><p>But then Margot yawns and says, \u201cI\u2019m really jet-lagged. I think I\u2019m going to take a nap.\u201d</p><p>When someone\u2019s been gone a long time, at first you save up all the things you want to tell them. You try to keep track of everything in your head. But it\u2019s like trying to hold on to a fistful of sand: all the little bits slip out of your hands, and then you\u2019re just clutching air and grit. That\u2019s why you can\u2019t save it all up like that.</p><p>Because by the time you finally see each other, you\u2019re catching up only on the big things, because it\u2019s too much bother to tell about the little things. But the little things are what make up life. Like a month ago when Daddy slipped on a banana peel, a literal banana peel that Kitty had dropped on the kitchen floor. Kitty and I laughed for ages. I should have e-mailed Margot about it right away; I should have taken a picture of the banana peel. Now everything feels like you had to be there and oh never mind, I guess it\u2019s not that funny. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Is this how people lose touch? I didn\u2019t think that could happen with sisters. Maybe with other people, but never us. Before Margot left, I knew what she was thinking without having to ask; I knew everything about her. Not anymore. I don\u2019t know what the view looks like outside her window, or if she still wakes up early every morning to have a real breakfast or if maybe now that she\u2019s at college she likes to go out late and sleep in late. I don\u2019t know if she prefers Scottish boys to American boys now, or if her roommate snores. All I know is she likes her classes and she\u2019s been to visit London once. So basically I know nothing.</p><p>And so does she. There are big things I haven\u2019t told her\u2014how my letters got sent out. The truth about me and Peter. The truth about me and Josh.</p><p>I wonder if Margot feels it too. The distance between us. If she even notices.</p><p>Daddy makes spaghetti bolognese for dinner. Kitty has hers with a big pickle and a glass of milk, which sounds terrible, but then I take a bite, and actually pickle and spaghetti taste good together. Milk, too.</p> <p>Kitty\u2019s dumping more noodles on her plate when she says, \u201cLara Jean, what are you going to get Peter for Christmas?\u201d</p><p>I glance at Margot, who is looking at me. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I hadn\u2019t thought about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I go with you to pick it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, if I get him something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to get him something; he\u2019s your boyfriend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you\u2019re dating Peter Kavinsky,\u201d Margot says.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t say it in a nice way, like it\u2019s a good thing. \u201cCan you just . . . not?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just don\u2019t like the guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to like him. I do,\u201d I say, and Margot shrugs.</p><p>Daddy stands up and claps his hands together. \u201cWe have three different kinds of ice cream for dessert! Pralines and cream, Chunky Monkey, and strawberry. All your favorites, Margot. Help me get the bowls, Kitty.\u201d They gather up the dirty dishes and go into the kitchen.</p><p>Margot looks out the window, toward Josh\u2019s house. \u201cJosh wants to see me later. I hope he finally gets that we\u2019re broken up and he doesn\u2019t try to come over every day while I\u2019m home. He needs to move on.\u201d</p> <p>What a mean thing to say. She\u2019s the one who\u2019s been calling Josh, not the other way around. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been pining for you, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re imagining,\u201d I say. \u201cHe gets that it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Margot stares at me in surprise. \u201cWell, I hope that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>60</p><p>\u201cI THINK WE SHOULD DO recital party this year,\u201d Margot says from her spot on the couch.</p><p>When my mom was alive, every Christmas we\u2019d have what she called a recital party. She\u2019d make tons of food and invite people over one night in December, and Margot and I would wear matching dresses and play Christmas carols on the piano all night. People would drift in and out of the piano room and sing along, and Margot and I would take turns playing. I hated real piano recitals because I was the worst in my age group and Margot was the best. It was humiliating to have to play some easy \u201cF\u00fcr Elise\u201d while the other kids had already moved on to Liszt. I always hated recital party. I used to beg and beg not to have to play.</p><p>The last Christmas, Mommy bought us matching red velvet dresses to wear, and I threw a fit and said I didn\u2019t want to wear it, even though I did, even though I loved it. I just didn\u2019t want to have to play the piano in it next to Margot. I screamed at her and I ran to my room and slammed the door and I wouldn\u2019t come out. Mommy came up and tried to get me to open the door, but I wouldn\u2019t, and she didn\u2019t come back. People started arriving, and Margot started playing the piano, and I stayed upstairs. I sat in my room, crying and thinking about all the dips and little canap\u00e9s Mommy and Daddy had made and how there would be none left for me and how Mommy probably didn\u2019t even want me down there anyway after the way I\u2019d behaved.</p><p>After Mommy died, we never had another recital party.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d I ask her.</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Margot shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun. I\u2019ll plan it all, you won\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I hate piano.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t play.\u201d</p><p>Kitty\u2019s looking from me to Margot with worried eyes. Biting her lip, she offers, \u201cI\u2019ll do some tae kwon do moves.\u201d</p><p>Margot reaches out and cuddles Kitty to her and says, \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea. I\u2019ll play the piano and you\u2019ll do tae kwon do, and Lara Jean will just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch,\u201d I finish.</p><p>\u201cI was going to say hostess, but suit yourself.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer her.</p><p>Later, we\u2019re watching TV and Kitty\u2019s asleep, curled up on the couch like she\u2019s a real cat. Margot wants to wake her up and make her go to her bed, but I say just let her sleep, and I put a quilt over her.</p><p>\u201cWill you help me work on Daddy about a puppy for Christmas?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Margot groans. \u201cPuppies are so much work. You have to let them out to pee like a million times a day. And they shed like crazy. You\u2019ll never be able to wear black pants again. Also who\u2019s going to walk it, and feed it, and take care of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitty will. And I\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitty is so not ready for the responsibility.\u201d Her eyes say, And neither are you.</p><p>\u201cKitty\u2019s matured a lot since you\u2019ve been gone.\u201d And so have I. \u201cDid you know that Kitty packs her own lunch now? And she helps with the laundry? I don\u2019t have to nag her to do her homework, either. She just does it on her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Then I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>Why can\u2019t she just say, Good job, Lara Jean? That\u2019s it. If she could just acknowledge that I\u2019ve been doing my part to keep the family going since she\u2019s been gone. But no.</p><p>61</p><p>AT SIX THIRTY IN THE morning the day of the ski trip, Daddy drops me off at school. It\u2019s not even light out yet. It seems like every day the sun takes longer and longer to come up. Before I hop out of the car, my dad pulls a hat out of his coat pocket. It\u2019s light pink yarn with a pom-pom on top. He fits it on my head so it covers my ears. \u201cI found this in the hall closet. I think it was one of your mom\u2019s. She was such a great skier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll go out on the slopes at least once.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re doing this. It\u2019s good for you to try new things.\u201d</p><p>I smile weakly. If he only knew what went down at the ski trip, he wouldn\u2019t be so glad then. Then I spot Peter and his friends messing around outside by the charter bus. \u201cThanks for the ride, Daddy. See you tomorrow night.\u201d I give him a peck on the cheek and grab my duffel bag.</p><p>\u201cZip up your coat,\u201d he calls out as I shut the car door.</p> <p>I zip up my coat and watch his car drive off. Across the parking lot, Peter\u2019s talking to Genevieve. He says something that makes her laugh. Then he sees me and gestures at me to come over. Genevieve walks away, looking down at her clipboard. When I get there, he takes my duffel bag off my shoulder and puts it next to his. \u201cI\u2019ll put this on the bus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s freezing,\u201d I say, my teeth chattering.</p><p>Peter pulls me in front of him and puts his arms around me. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you warm.\u201d I look up at him like so cheesy, but his attention is somewhere else. He\u2019s watching Genevieve. He snuggles against my neck, and I squirm away from him. \u201cWhat\u2019s with you?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I say.</p><p>Ms. Davenport and Coach White are looking through kids\u2019 bags\u2014Ms. Davenport\u2019s doing the girls and Coach White is doing the boys. \u201cWhat are they looking for?\u201d I ask Peter.</p> <p>\u201cAlcohol.\u201d</p><p>I whip out my phone and text Chris.</p><p>Don\u2019t bring alcohol! They are checking!</p><p>No response.</p><p>Are you awake??</p><p>Wake up!</p> <p>But then her mom\u2019s SUV pulls into the parking lot and she stumbles out of the passenger seat. She looks like she just woke up.</p><p>What a relief! Peter can talk to Genevieve all he wants; I\u2019ll be sharing a seat with Chris and eating the snacks I packed. I have strawberry gummies and the wasabi peas that Chris loves, and Pocky sticks.</p><p>Peter groans. \u201cChris is coming?\u201d</p><p>I ignore him and wave at her.</p><p>Genevieve\u2019s standing by the bus with her clipboard when she spots Chris too. She has a big frown on her face. She marches right up to Chris and says, \u201cYou didn\u2019t sign up.\u201d</p><p>I run over to them and hover next to Chris. In a small voice I say, \u201cIn the announcements last week they said there were still spots left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that you had to sign up for.\u201d Genevieve shakes her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but Chrissy can\u2019t come if she didn\u2019t sign up or give a deposit.\u201d</p><p>I wince. Chris hates being called \u201cChrissy.\u201d She always has. She started going by Chris as soon as we got to high school, and the only people who still call her that are Genevieve and their grandma.</p> <p>Peter shows up beside me out of nowhere. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Folding her arms, Genevieve says, \u201cChrissy didn\u2019t sign up for the ski trip, so I\u2019m sorry, but she can\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m panicking, but all the while Chris is smirking and saying nothing.</p><p>Peter rolls his eyes and says, \u201cGen, just let her come. Who gives a shit if she didn\u2019t sign up?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flush with anger. \u201cI didn\u2019t make the rules, Peter! Should she just get to come for free? How is that fair to everybody else?\u201d</p><p>Chris finally speaks. \u201cOh, I already talked to Davenport and she said it was cool.\u201d Chris makes a kissy face at Genevieve. \u201cToo bad, Gen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, whatever, I don\u2019t care.\u201d Genevieve turns on her heel and spins off in Ms. Davenport\u2019s direction.</p><p>Chris watches her go, grinning. I tug on her coat sleeve. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so from the beginning?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cObvi because it was more fun that way.\u201d She slings her arm around my shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an interesting weekend, Covey.\u201d</p><p>Worried, I whisper, \u201cYou didn\u2019t bring any alcohol, did you? They\u2019re checking bags.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m covered.\u201d</p><p>When I give her a dubious look, she whispers back, \u201cShampoo bottle filled with tequila at the bottom of my bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you washed it out really well! You could get sick!\u201d I\u2019m envisioning Chris and company trying to take shots of bubbly tequila and then having to go to the hospital to get their stomachs pumped.</p><p>Chris ruffles my hair. \u201cOh, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>We file onto the bus and Peter slides into a seat in the middle and I shuffle forward. \u201cHey,\u201d he says, surprised. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to sit with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sitting with Chris.\u201d I try to keep walking down the aisle, but Peter grabs my arm.</p><p>\u201cLara Jean! Are you kidding me? You have to sit with me.\u201d He looks around to see if anybody\u2019s listening. \u201cYou\u2019re my girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>I shake him off. \u201cWe\u2019re breaking up soon, aren\u2019t we? We might as well make it look more realistic.\u201d</p><p>When I slide into the seat next to her, Chris is shaking her head at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I couldn\u2019t just let you sit alone. You came here for me, after all.\u201d I open up my backpack and show her the snacks. \u201cSee? I brought your favorite things. What do you want to eat first? Gummies or Pocky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s barely even morning,\u201d she grouses. Then: \u201cHand me the gummies.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, I rip open the bag for her. \u201cHave as much as you want.\u201d</p><p>I stop smiling when I see Genevieve get on the bus and sit down in the seat next to Peter.</p><p>\u201cYou did that,\u201d Chris says.</p><p>\u201cFor you!\u201d Which isn\u2019t true, not really. I think maybe I\u2019m just tired of all this. This in-betweenness of being somebody\u2019s girlfriend but not really.</p><p>Chris stretches. \u201cI know you\u2019re all about hos before bros, but if I were you, I\u2019d be careful. My cousin\u2019s a barracuda.\u201d</p><p>I stuff a gummy into my mouth and chew. It\u2019s hard to swallow. I watch Genevieve whisper something in Peter\u2019s ear, and Chris falls asleep right away just like she said, her head on my shoulder.</p><p>The lodge is exactly the way Peter described\u2014there\u2019s a big fireplace and bearskin rugs and lots of little nooks. It\u2019s snowing outside, tiny little whisper flakes. Chris is in good spirits\u2014halfway through the bus ride she woke up and started flirting with Charlie Blanchard, who\u2019s going to take her out on the black diamond slopes. We even lucked out with a double room instead of a triple, because all the other girls had signed up for triples together.</p><p>Chris went off to snowboard with Charlie. She invited me to come along, but I said no thanks. I tried to ski next to Margot when she snowboarded once, and it ended up with us coming down the slopes at different times and waiting for each other and then losing each other all day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If Peter were to invite me to go snowboarding with him, I think I\u2019d go. But he doesn\u2019t, and I\u2019m hungry anyway, so I go to the lodge to eat lunch.</p><p>Ms. Davenport is there looking at her cell phone and eating a bowl of soup. Ms. Davenport is young, but she presents herself old. I think it\u2019s her heavy foundation and her severe part down the middle. She isn\u2019t married. Chris told me she saw her having an argument with some guy outside the Waffle House once, so I guess she has a boyfriend.</p><p>When she spots me sitting alone, eating a sandwich by the fireplace, she waves me over. I carry my plate to her table and sit down across from her. I\u2019d rather eat alone and read my book, but it\u2019s not like I have much of a choice in the matter. I ask her, \u201cDo you have to stay here in the lodge all weekend, or can you go ski too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m officially home base,\u201d she says, wiping the corners of her mouth. \u201cCoach White\u2019s on slope duty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem very fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind. I actually like sitting in the lodge. It\u2019s peaceful. Besides, somebody has to be here for emergencies.\u201d She takes another bite of soup. \u201cWhat about you, Lara Jean? Why aren\u2019t you out on the slopes with everybody else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the best skier,\u201d I say, feeling embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cOh, really? I hear Kavinsky\u2019s a very good snowboarder. You should get him to teach you. Aren\u2019t you two dating?\u201d</p><p>Ms. Davenport loves being in on student drama. She calls it having her finger on the pulse, but really she\u2019s just a gossip. If you give her an opening, she\u2019ll burrow in for as much dirt as she can. I know she and Genevieve are close.</p> <p>I have a quick flash of Genevieve and Peter on the bus with their heads close together, and the picture makes my heart squeeze. Our contract isn\u2019t over yet. Why should I let her have him back even one second early? \u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019re together.\u201d Then I stand up. \u201cYou know what? I think I will go check out the slopes.\u201d</p><p>62</p><p>I\u2019M BUNDLED UP IN MARGOT\u2019S pink ski bib and the pom-pom hat and my parka and I feel like an Easter treat\u2014a strawberry-flavored marshmallow. As I try to click into my skis, a group of girls from school walk by in cute yoga-ish ski pants. I didn\u2019t even know those existed.</p><p>I always think I could like skiing and then I go on a ski trip and I remember, oh yeah, I hate it. All the other kids are on the black diamond slopes and I\u2019m on green circle, aka the bunny slope. I pizza wedge down the whole way, and little kids keep zooming by me, which makes me lose my concentration because I\u2019m terrified they\u2019re going to run into me. They whoosh back and forth like Olympic skiers. Some of them aren\u2019t even using poles. They\u2019re like Kitty. She can go down black diamond slopes. She and my dad love it. Margot, too, though Margot prefers snowboarding to skiing now.</p><p>I\u2019ve been keeping my eyes peeled for Peter but I haven\u2019t seen him yet, and it\u2019s starting to feel a bit bleak out here all alone.</p><p>I\u2019m considering giving the intermediate slope a try, just for kicks, when I spot Peter and all his friends carrying their snowboards. No Genevieve in sight. \u201cPeter!\u201d I call out, feeling very relieved.</p> <p>He turns his head and I think he sees me, but he keeps walking.</p><p>Huh.</p><p>He saw me. I know he saw me.</p><p>After dinner, Chris goes back to the slopes to snowboard. She says she\u2019s addicted to the rush. I\u2019m heading back to the room when I run into Peter again, this time in swimming trunks and a hoodie. He\u2019s with Gabe and Darrell. They have towels around their necks. \u201cHey, Large,\u201d Gabe says, flicking me with his towel. \u201cWhere you been all day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been around.\u201d I look over at Peter, but he won\u2019t meet my eyes. \u201cI saw you guys on the slopes.\u201d</p><p>Darrell says, \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you holler at us? I wanted to show off my ollies for you.\u201d</p><p>Teasingly I say, \u201cWell, I called Peter\u2019s name, but I guess he didn\u2019t hear me.\u201d</p><p>Peter finally looks me in the eyes. \u201cNope. I didn\u2019t hear you.\u201d His voice is cold and indifferent and so un-Peterlike, the smile fades from my face.</p> <p>Gabe and Darrell exchange looks like oooh and Gabe says to Peter, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna head out to the hot tub,\u201d and they trot off.</p><p>Peter and I are left standing in the lobby, neither of us saying anything. I finally ask, \u201cAre you mad at me or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I be mad?\u201d</p><p>And then it\u2019s back to quiet again.</p><p>I say, \u201cYou know, you\u2019re the one who talked me into coming on this trip. The least you could do is talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe least you could do was sit next to me on the bus!\u201d he bursts out.</p><p>My mouth hangs open. \u201cAre you really that mad that I didn\u2019t sit next to you on the bus?\u201d</p><p>Peter lets out an impatient breath of air. \u201cLara Jean, when you\u2019re dating someone, there are just . . . certain things you do, okay? Like sit next to each other on a school trip. That\u2019s pretty much expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t see what the big deal is,\u201d I say. How can he be this mad over such a tiny thing?</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d He turns like he\u2019s going to leave, and I grab his sweatshirt sleeve. I don\u2019t want to be in a fight with him; I just want it to be fun and light the way it always is with us. I want him to at least still be my friend. Especially now that we\u2019re at the end.</p><p>I say, \u201cCome on, don\u2019t be mad. I didn\u2019t realize it was that big of a deal. I swear I\u2019ll sit next to you on the way home, okay?\u201d</p><p>He purses his lips. \u201cBut do you get why I was pissed?\u201d</p><p>I nod back. \u201cMm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then, you should know that you missed out on mocha sugar donuts.\u201d</p><p>My mouth falls open. \u201cHow\u2019d you get those? I thought the shop didn\u2019t open that early!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went out and got them last night specifically for the bus ride,\u201d Peter says. \u201cFor you and me.\u201d</p><p>Aw. I\u2019m touched. \u201cWell, are there any left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I ate them all.\u201d</p><p>He looks so smug that I reach out and swat at his hoodie strings. \u201cYou creep,\u201d I say, but I mean it affectionately.</p><p>Peter grabs my hand mid-swat and says, \u201cWanna hear something funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I started liking you.\u201d</p><p>I go completely still. Then I pull my hand away from his, and I start to gather my hair into a ponytail, and then I remember I don\u2019t have a hair tie. My heart is thudding in my chest and it\u2019s hard to think all of a sudden. \u201cStop teasing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not teasing. Why do you think I kissed you that day at McClaren\u2019s house back in seventh grade? It\u2019s why I went along with this thing in the first place. I\u2019ve always thought you were cute.\u201d</p><p>My face feels hot. \u201cIn a quirky way.\u201d</p><p>Peter grins his perfect grin. \u201cSo? I guess I must like quirky, then.\u201d</p><p>Then he leans his head closer to mine, and I blurt out, \u201cBut aren\u2019t you still in love with Genevieve?\u201d</p> <p>Peter frowns.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you always bringing up Gen? I\u2019m trying to talk about us, and all you want to do is talk about her. Yeah, Gen and I have history. I\u2019m always going to care about her.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cBut now . . . I like you.\u201d</p><p>People are walking in and out of the lodge; a guy from school walks by and claps Peter on the shoulder. \u201cWhat up,\u201d Peter says. When he\u2019s gone, Peter says to me, \u201cSo what do you say?\u201d He\u2019s looking at me expectantly. He\u2019s expecting me to say yes.</p><p>I want to say yes, but I don\u2019t want to be with a boy whose heart belongs to somebody else. Just once, I want to be somebody\u2019s first choice. \u201cYou might think you like me, but you don\u2019t. If you did, you wouldn\u2019t still like her.\u201d</p><p>Peter shakes his head. \u201cWhat Gen and I have is completely separate from you and me,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cHow can that be true when from the very first minute, this has been about Genevieve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d he objects. \u201cWhen we started this thing, you liked Sanderson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d I swallow hard. \u201cBut you still love Genevieve.\u201d</p><p>Frustrated, Peter backs away from me and runs his hands through his hair. \u201cGod, what makes you such an expert on love? You\u2019ve liked five guys in your life. One was gay, one lives in Indiana or Montana or some place, McClaren moved away before anything could actually happen, one was dating your sister. And then there\u2019s me. Hmm, what do we all have in common? What\u2019s the common denominator?\u201d</p><p>I feel all the blood rush to my face. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>Peter leans in close and says, \u201cYou only like guys you don\u2019t have a shot with, because you\u2019re scared. What are you so scared of?\u201d</p> <p>I back away from him, right into the wall. \u201cI\u2019m not scared of anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you\u2019re not. You\u2019d rather make up a fantasy version of somebody in your head than be with a real person.\u201d</p><p>I glare at him. \u201cYou\u2019re just mad because I didn\u2019t die of happiness because the great Peter Kavinsky said he liked me. Your ego really is that enormous.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flash. \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t show up on your doorstep with flowers and profess my undying love for you, Lara Jean, but guess what, that\u2019s not real life. You need to grow up.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s it. I don\u2019t have to listen to this. I turn on my heel and walk away. Over my shoulder I say, \u201cEnjoy the hot tub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always do,\u201d he calls back.</p><p>I\u2019m shaking.</p><p>Is it true? Could he be right?</p> <p>Back at the room, I change into my flannel nighty and put on thick socks. I don\u2019t even go wash up. I just turn out the lights and crawl into bed. I can\u2019t fall asleep, though. Every time I close my eyes, I see Peter\u2019s face.</p><p>How dare he say I need to grow up? What does he know about anything? As if he\u2019s so mature!</p><p>But . . . is he right about me? Do I only like the boys I can never have? I\u2019ve always known Peter was out of my reach. I\u2019ve always known he didn\u2019t belong to me. But tonight he said he liked me. The thing I\u2019ve been hoping for, he said it. So why didn\u2019t I just tell him I liked him back when I had the chance? Because I do. I like him back. Of course I do. What girl wouldn\u2019t fall for Peter Kavinsky, handsomest boy of all the Handsome Boys. Now that I really know him, I know he\u2019s so much more than that.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to be afraid anymore. I want to be brave. I want . . . life to start happening. I want to fall in love and I want a boy to fall in love with me back.</p><p>Before I can talk myself out of it, I put on my puffy coat, slip my keycard in my pocket, and head off to the hot tub.</p><p>63</p><p>THE HOT TUB IS BEHIND the main lodge, tucked in the woods on a wooden platform. On the way there, I run into kids with wet hair who are on their way back to their rooms before curfew. Curfew is at eleven, and it\u2019s already ten forty-five. There\u2019s not much time left. I hope Peter\u2019s still out there. I don\u2019t want to lose my nerve. So I quicken my pace and that\u2019s when I spot him, alone in the hot tub, his head tipped back with his eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, and my voice echoes into the woods.</p><p>His eyes fly open. Nervously, he looks over my shoulder. \u201cLara Jean! What are you doing out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to see you,\u201d I say, and my breath comes out in white puffs. I start taking off my boots and socks. My hands are shaking, and not because it\u2019s cold. I\u2019m nervous.</p><p>\u201cUh . . . what are you doing?\u201d Peter\u2019s looking at me like I\u2019m crazy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting in!\u201d Shivering, I unzip my puffy coat and set it on the bench. Steam is rising out of the water. I dip my feet in and sit down on the ledge of the hot tub. It\u2019s hotter than a bath, but it feels nice. Peter\u2019s still watching me warily. My heart is racing out of control and it\u2019s difficult to look him in the eyes. I\u2019ve never been so scared in my life. \u201cThat thing you brought up earlier . . . you caught me off guard, so I didn\u2019t know what to say. But . . . well, I like you too.\u201d It comes out so fumbly and uncertain, and I wish I could start over and say it smoothly and confidently. I try again, louder. \u201cI like you, Peter.\u201d</p><p>Peter blinks, and he looks so young all of a sudden. \u201cI don\u2019t understand you girls. I think I have you figured out, and then . . . and then . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d I hold my breath as I wait for him to speak. I\u2019m so nervous; I keep swallowing, and it sounds loud to my ears. Even my breathing sounds loud, even my heartbeat.</p><p>His pupils are dilated he\u2019s looking at me so hard. He\u2019s staring at me like he\u2019s never seen me before. \u201cAnd then I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>I think I stop breathing when I hear him say \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Did I screw things up that badly that now he doesn\u2019t know? It can\u2019t be over, not when I finally found my courage. I can\u2019t let it be. My heart is pounding like a million trillion beats a minute as I scoot closer to him. I bend my head down and press my lips against his, and I feel his jolt of surprise. And then he\u2019s kissing me back, open-mouthed, soft-lipped kissing-me-back, and at first I\u2019m nervous, but then he puts his hand on the back of my head, and he strokes my hair in a reassuring way, and I\u2019m not so nervous anymore. It\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m sitting down on this ledge, because I am weak in the knees. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pulls me into the water so I\u2019m sitting in the hot tub too, and my nightgown is soaked now but I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care about anything. I never knew kissing could be this good.</p><p>My arms are at my sides so the jets won\u2019t make my skirt fly up. Peter\u2019s holding my face in his hands, kissing me. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he whispers. His voice is different: it\u2019s ragged and urgent and vulnerable somehow. He doesn\u2019t sound like the Peter I know; he is not smooth or bored or amused. The way he\u2019s looking at me right now, I know he would do anything I asked, and that\u2019s a strange and powerful feeling.</p><p>I wind my arms around his neck. I like the smell of chlorine on his skin. He smells like pool, and summer, and vacations. It\u2019s not like in the movies. It\u2019s better, because it\u2019s real.</p><p>\u201cTouch my hair again,\u201d I tell him, and the corners of his mouth turn up.</p> <p>I lean into him and kiss him. He starts to run his fingers through my hair, and it feels so nice I can\u2019t think straight. It\u2019s better than getting my hair washed at the salon. I move my hands down his back and along his spine, and he shivers and pulls me closer. A boy\u2019s back feels so different than a girl\u2019s back\u2014more muscular, more solid somehow.</p><p>In between kisses he says, \u201cIt\u2019s past curfew. We should go back inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d I say. All I want is to stay and be here, with Peter, in this moment.</p><p>\u201cMe either, but I don\u2019t want you to get in trouble,\u201d Peter says. He looks worried, which is so sweet.</p><p>Softly, I touch his cheek with the back of my hand. It\u2019s smooth. I could look at his face for hours, it\u2019s so beautiful.</p> <p>Then I stand up, and immediately I\u2019m shivering. I start wringing the water out of my nightgown, and Peter jumps out of the hot tub and gets his towel, which he wraps around my shoulders. Then he gives me his hand and I step out, teeth chattering. He starts drying me off with the towel, my arms and legs. I sit down to put on my socks and boots. He puts my coat on me last. He zips me right in.</p><p>Then we run back inside the lodge. Before he goes to the boys\u2019 side and I go to the girls\u2019 side, I kiss him one more time and I feel like I\u2019m flying.</p><p>64</p><p>WHEN I SEE PETER AT the bus the next morning, he\u2019s standing around with all his lacrosse friends, and at first I feel shy and nervous, but then he sees me, and his face breaks into a grin. \u201cC\u2019mere, Covey,\u201d he says, so I go to him and he throws my tote over his shoulder. In my ear he says, \u201cYou\u2019re sitting with me, right?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>As we make our way onto the bus, somebody wolf whistles. It seems like people are staring at us, and at first I think it\u2019s just my imagination, but then I see Genevieve look right at me and whisper to Emily Nussbaum. It sends a chill down my spine.</p> <p>\u201cGenevieve keeps staring at me,\u201d I whisper to Peter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re so adorably quirky,\u201d he says, and he rests his hands on my shoulders and gives me a kiss on the cheek, and I forget all about Genevieve.</p><p>Peter and I sit in the middle of the bus with Gabe and the lacrosse guys. I wave to Chris so she\u2019ll sit with us, but she\u2019s cozy with Charlie Blanchard. I haven\u2019t had a chance to tell her about last night. When I got back to the room, she was already asleep. This morning, we both overslept and there wasn\u2019t time. I\u2019ll tell her all about it later. But, for now, it\u2019s kind of nice that Peter and I are the only ones who know about it.</p><p>The way down the mountain, I share my Pocky sticks with the boys and we play a heated round of Uno, which I also brought.</p><p>An hour into the trip, we stop at a rest-stop diner for breakfast. I eat a cinnamon bun, and under the table Peter and I hold hands.</p><p>I go to use the bathroom, and there is Genevieve, alone, applying lip gloss with a little brush. I step inside the stall to pee and hope she\u2019ll be gone by the time I come out, but she\u2019s still there. I wash my hands quickly, and then she says, \u201cDid you know that when we were kids, I used to wish I was you?\u201d I freeze. Genevieve snaps her compact shut. \u201cI used to wish your dad was my dad and Margot and Kitty were my sisters. I loved coming over to your house. I would hope and pray that you would invite me to sleep over. I hated being at home with my dad.\u201d</p><p>Haltingly, I say, \u201cI-I didn\u2019t know that. I used to like going to your house, because your mom was so nice to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe really liked you,\u201d Genevieve says.</p> <p>I screw up all my courage and I ask, \u201cSo why did you stop being friends with me?\u201d</p><p>Genevieve narrows her eyes at me. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kissed Peter that day at my house in seventh grade. You knew I liked him, but you kissed him anyway.\u201d I recoil, and she continues. \u201cI always knew your goody-goody act was fake. It\u2019s no wonder you and my cousin are BFFs now. Although at least Chris owns her sluttiness. She doesn\u2019t put on an act.\u201d</p><p>My whole body goes rigid. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>She laughs, and it\u2019s chilling how happy she sounds. That\u2019s when I know I\u2019m already dead. I brace myself for whatever mean thing will come out of her mouth, but even still I\u2019m not ready for what comes next.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about how you and Peter had full-on sex in the hot tub last night.\u201d</p><p>My mind goes completely blank. I might even black out for a second. I can feel myself sway on my feet. Somebody come quick with the smelling salts; I\u2019m about to faint.</p><p>My head is swimming. \u201cWho told you that?\u201d I choke out. \u201cWho said that?\u201d</p><p>Genevieve tilts her head to the side. \u201cEverybody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014but we didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I think it\u2019s absolutely disgusting. I mean, sex in a hot tub\u2014a public hot tub\u2014is just . . .\u201d She shudders. \u201cGod only knows what kind of stuff is floating around in there now. Families use that hot tub, Lara Jean. There could be a family in there right now.\u201d</p><p>Tears are spiking my eyes. \u201cAll we did was kiss. I don\u2019t know why people would even say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, because Peter\u2019s telling them you did?\u201d</p><p>My whole body goes cold. It\u2019s not true. There\u2019s no way that\u2019s true.</p><p>\u201cAll the guys think he\u2019s a god \u2019cause he got sweet little Lara Jean Covey to give it up in the hot tub. Just so you know, the only reason Peter even dated you was to make me jealous. His ego couldn\u2019t take the fact that I dumped him for an older guy. He was using you. If he got free sex out of it, all the better. But he still came running whenever I called. That\u2019s because he loves me. He will never love another girl as much as he loves me.\u201d Whatever she sees in my face must please her, because she smiles. \u201cNow that Blake and I are done . . . well, I guess we\u2019ll see, won\u2019t we?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stand there mute and numb as she fluffs her hair in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t worry.

I run out of the ladies\u2019 room and out the doors, back onto the bus, and I cry.</p><p>65</p> <p>PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO FILE back on the bus. I can feel their eyes on me so I keep my head turned toward the window. I run my finger along the edge of the foggy glass. The window is cold, so it leaves a trail.</p><p>Chris slides in next to me. In a low voice she says, \u201cUm, I just heard something cray-cray.\u201d</p><p>Dully I say, \u201cWhat did you hear? That Peter and I had sex in the hot tub last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God! Yeah! Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>My chest feels really tight. If I get in a good breath, I am going to start crying again, I know it.</p> <p>I close my eyes. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have sex. Who told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlie.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s making his way down the aisle. He stops at our seat. \u201cHey, why didn\u2019t you come back to the table? Is everything okay?\u201d Peter is looming over the seat, looking at me with concerned eyes.</p><p>In a quiet voice I say, \u201cEverybody\u2019s saying how we had sex in the tub.\u201d</p><p>Peter groans. \u201cPeople need to mind their own business.\u201d He doesn\u2019t sound surprised, not at all.</p><p>\u201cSo you already knew?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome of the guys were asking me about it this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . where did they even get that idea?\u201d I feel like I\u2019m going to be sick.</p><p>Peter shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe somebody saw us. What does it even matter? It\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>I screw my lips together tight. I can\u2019t cry right now, because if I start, I\u2019ll never be able to stop. I will cry the whole way home, and everyone will see, and I can\u2019t have that. I fix my gaze somewhere over Peter\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it. Why are you mad at me?\u201d He\u2019s still confused.</p><p>People are starting to bottleneck behind Peter. They need to get to their seats. \u201cPeople are waiting behind you,\u201d I say.</p><p>Peter says, \u201cChris, can I have my seat?\u201d</p><p>Chris looks at me and I shake my head.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my seat now, Kavinsky,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Lara Jean,\u201d Peter says, touching my shoulder.</p><p>I jerk away from him and his mouth drops open. People are looking at us and whispering and snickering. Peter glances over his shoulder, his face red. Then he finally makes his way down the aisle.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Chris asks.</p><p>I can feel my eyes welling up. \u201cNo. Not really.\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair for the girl. Guys have it easy. I\u2019m sure they were all congratulating him, pounding him on the back for being such a stud.\u201d</p><p>Sniffling, I say, \u201cDo you think he\u2019s the one who told people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d</p><p>A tear trickles down to my cheek and Chris wipes it away with her sweater sleeve. \u201cIt might not have been him. But it doesn\u2019t matter, Lara Jean, because even if he didn\u2019t encourage all the talk, I doubt he discouraged it, if you know what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is, I\u2019m sure he denied it\u2014with a shit-eating grin on his face. That\u2019s how guys like Peter are. They love to look like the man, have all the other guys look up to them.\u201d Bitterly she says, \u201cThey care more about their reputation than yours.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cBut what\u2019s done is done. You\u2019ve just gotta hold your head up and act like you don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d</p><p>I nod, but more tears leak out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, he isn\u2019t worth it. Let Gen have him.\u201d Chris tousles my hair. \u201cWhat else can you do, kid?\u201d</p><p>Genevieve comes on board last. I quickly straighten up and wipe my eyes and brace myself. But she doesn\u2019t go directly to her seat. She stops at Bethy Morgan\u2019s seat and whispers something in her ear. Bethy gasps and turns in her seat\u2014and looks right at me.</p><p>Oh my God.</p><p>Chris and I watch as Genevieve goes from seat to seat.</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d Chris breathes.</p><p>Tears burn my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna go to sleep now,\u201d and I rest my head on Chris\u2019s shoulder, and I cry. She keeps her arm tight around me.</p><p>66</p><p>MARGOT AND KITTY PICK ME up from school. They ask me how the trip was, if I stayed on the bunny slope all day. I try to be upbeat; I even make up a story about how I went down a blue circle slope. Softly Margot asks, \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>I falter. Margot always knows when I\u2019m not telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m just tired. Chris and I stayed up late talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a nap when we get home,\u201d Margot advises.</p><p>My phone buzzes, and I look down at it. A text from Peter.</p><p>Can we talk?</p><p>I turn off my phone. \u201cI think maybe I\u2019ll just sleep right through Christmas break,\u201d I say. Thank God and Jesus for Christmas break. At least I have ten days before I have to go back to school and face everyone. Maybe I\u2019ll just never go back. Maybe I can convince Daddy to home school me.</p><p>When Daddy and Kitty go to bed, Margot and I wrap presents in the living room. Mid-wrap, Margot decides that we should have recital party the day after Christmas. I\u2019d hoped she\u2019d forgotten all about her grand idea to have recital party, but Margot\u2019s memory has always been killer. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a post-Christmas, pre\u2013New Year\u2019s Eve party,\u201d she says, tying a bow on one of Kitty\u2019s presents from Daddy.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too last-minute,\u201d I say, carefully cutting a sheet of rocking-horse wrapping paper. I\u2019m being extra careful because I want to save a strip of it for a background page in Margot\u2019s scrapbook, which is nearly done. \u201cNo one will come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes they will! We haven\u2019t had one in ages; tons of people used to come.\u201d Margot gets up and starts pulling down Mommy\u2019s old cookbooks and stacking them on the coffee table. \u201cDon\u2019t be a Grinch. I think this should be a tradition that we bring back for Kitty\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>I cut off a strip of fat green ribbon. Maybe this party will help me take my mind off things. \u201cFind that Mediterranean chicken dish Mommy used to make. With the honey-yogurt dip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! And remember the caviar dip? People love the caviar dip. We have to make that, too. Should we do cheese straws or cheese puffs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheese puffs,\u201d I say. Margot\u2019s so excited about it that even in my current state of self-pity, I can\u2019t begrudge her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She gets a pen and paper from the kitchen and starts writing things down. \u201cSo we said the chicken dish, caviar dip, cheese puffs, punch . . . We can bake some cookies or brownies. We\u2019ll invite all the neighbors\u2014Josh and his parents, the Shahs, Ms. Rothschild. Who of your friends do you want to invite? Chris?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cChris is visiting her relatives in Boca Raton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Peter? He could bring his mom, and doesn\u2019t he have a younger brother?\u201d I can tell she is trying.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s leave off Peter,\u201d I say.</p> <p>Her forehead creases and she looks up from her list. \u201cDid something happen on the ski trip?\u201d</p><p>Too quickly I say, \u201cNo. Nothing happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why not? I want to get to know him better, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he might be going out of town too.\u201d I can tell Margot doesn\u2019t believe me, but she doesn\u2019t press me further.</p><p>She sends the evites out that night, and right away there are five yeses. In the comments section Aunt D. (not our real aunt, but one of Mommy\u2019s best friends) writes, Margot, I can\u2019t wait to hear you and dad sing \u201cBaby, It\u2019s Cold Outside!\u201d Another recital party tradition. Margot and Daddy sing \u201cBaby, It\u2019s Cold Outside\u201d and I am always commissioned to sing \u201cSanta Baby.\u201d I used to do it lying on top of the piano with my mom\u2019s high heels on and our grandma\u2019s fox stole. Not this year. No way.</p> <p>When Margot tries to get me to go with her and Kitty to deliver our cookie baskets to the neighbors the next day, I beg off and say I\u2019m tired. I go up to my room to put the finishing touches on Margot\u2019s scrapbook and listen to only the slow songs from Dirty Dancing, and I keep checking my phone to see if Peter\u2019s texted again. He hasn\u2019t, but Josh has.</p><p>I heard what happened. Are you okay?</p><p>So even Josh knows? He\u2019s not even in our grade. Does the whole school know?</p><p>I write back, It isn\u2019t true, and he writes back, You don\u2019t have to tell me\u2014I didn\u2019t believe it for a second, which makes me feel weepy.</p><p>He and Margot have hung out once since she\u2019s been home, but they haven\u2019t taken that DC trip Josh mentioned. It\u2019s probably for the best if I go ahead and take the Josh-and-Margot page out of the scrapbook.</p><p>I stay up late just in case Peter texts again. I think to myself, if Peter calls or texts me tonight, I\u2019ll know he\u2019s thinking about me too and maybe I\u2019ll forgive him. But he doesn\u2019t text or call.</p> <p>Around three a.m. I throw away Peter\u2019s notes. I delete the picture of him from my phone; I delete his number. I think that if I just delete him enough, it will be like none of it ever happened and my heart won\u2019t hurt so badly.</p><p>67</p><p>CHRISTMAS MORNING, KITTY WAKES UP everyone while it is still dark out, which is her tradition, and Daddy makes waffles, which is his tradition. We only ever eat waffles on Christmas, because we all agree it\u2019s too much trouble to lug the waffle iron out and clean it and store it back on the cabinet top shelf where we keep it. And anyway it makes waffles more of a special occasion this way.</p><p>We take turns opening presents to make it last longer. I give Margot her scarf, and the scrapbook, which she loves. She pores over every page, exclaiming over my handiwork, marveling over my font choices and paper scraps. Hugging it to her chest, she says, \u201cThis is the perfect gift,\u201d and I feel like all the tension and bad feelings between us evaporate into nothingness. Margot\u2019s gift to me is a pale pink cashmere sweater from Scotland. I try it on over my nightgown and it\u2019s so soft and luxurious.</p><p>Kitty\u2019s present from Margot is an art set with oil pastels and watercolors and special markers, which makes Kitty squeal like a piglet. In return Kitty gives her socks with monkeys on them. I give Kitty a new basket for her bike and the ant farm she asked for months ago, and Kitty gives me a book on knitting. \u201cSo you can get better,\u201d she says.</p><p>The three of us pitched in for Daddy\u2019s present\u2014a thick Scandinavian sweater that makes him look like an ice fisherman. It\u2019s a little too big, but Daddy insists he likes it that way. He gives Margot a fancy new e-reader, Kitty a bike helmet with her name on it\u2014Katherine, not Kitty\u2014and me a gift certificate to Linden &amp; White. \u201cI wanted to get you that locket necklace you\u2019re always looking at, but it was gone,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I bet you\u2019ll find something else you like just as much.\u201d I jump up and throw my arms around him. I feel like I could cry.</p><p>Santa, aka Daddy, brings silly gifts like sacks of coal and water guns with disappearing ink inside, and also practical things like athletic socks and printer ink and my favorite kind of pens\u2014I guess Santa shops at Costco too.</p><p>When we\u2019re done opening presents, I can tell Kitty is disappointed there is no puppy, but she doesn\u2019t say anything. I pull her into my arms and whisper to her, \u201cThere\u2019s always your birthday next month,\u201d and she nods.</p> <p>Daddy goes to see if the waffle iron is hot and the doorbell rings. \u201cKitty, could you get that?\u201d he calls from the kitchen.</p><p>Kitty goes to the door, and seconds later we hear her high-pitched scream. Margot and I leap up and run to the door, and right there on the welcome mat is a basket with a biscuit-colored puppy in it and a ribbon around its neck. We all start jumping up and down and screaming.</p><p>Kitty scoops the puppy up in her arms and runs into the living room with it, where Daddy stands grinning. \u201cDaddy Daddy Daddy!\u201d she squeals. \u201cThank you thank you thank you!\u201d</p><p>According to Daddy, he picked the puppy up from the animal shelter two nights ago, and our neighbor Ms. Rothschild has been hiding him in her house. It\u2019s a boy, by the way\u2014we figure that out pretty quick, since he pees all over the kitchen floor. He is a Wheaten Terrier mix, which Kitty declares is far better than an Akita or a German shepherd.</p><p>\u201cI always wanted a dog with bangs,\u201d I say, cuddling him to my cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhat should we name him?\u201d Margot asks. We all look to Kitty, who chews on her bottom lip in a contemplative way.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cHow about Sandy?\u201d I suggest.</p><p>Kitty sneers. \u201cUnoriginal.\u201d</p><p>So I say, \u201cWhat about Fran\u00e7ois? We can call him Frankie for short.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d Kitty says. Cocking her head, she says, \u201cWhat about Jamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie,\u201d Daddy repeats. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>Margot nods. \u201cIt has a nice ring to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his full name?\u201d I ask, setting him down on the floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kitty promptly says, \u201cJamie Fox-Pickle, but we\u2019ll only call him that when he\u2019s in trouble.\u201d She claps her hands and coos, \u201cCome here, Jamie!\u201d and he skitters over to her, tail wagging like mad.</p><p>I\u2019ve never her seen her so happy or so patient. She spends all of Christmas Day trying to teach him tricks and taking him outside to pee. Her eyes never stop shining. It makes me wish I was little again and everything could be solved with a Christmas Day puppy.</p><p>I only check my phone once to see if Peter called. And he didn\u2019t.</p><p>68</p> <p>THE MORNING OF THE PARTY I come downstairs after ten, and they\u2019ve been working for hours. Margot\u2019s the head chef and Daddy\u2019s her sous-chef. She has him chopping onions and celery and washing pots. To us she says, \u201cLara Jean, I need you to clean the downstairs bathroom and mop and tidy. Kitty, you\u2019re overseeing decorations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we at least have some cereal first?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYes, but be quick about it.\u201d She goes back to scooping cookie dough.</p><p>To Kitty I whisper, \u201cI didn\u2019t even want to have this party and now she\u2019s got me scrubbing the toilet. Why do you get the good job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m the littlest,\u201d Kitty says, climbing onto a stool at the breakfast bar.</p> <p>Margot spins around and says, \u201cHello, the toilet needed to be scrubbed anyway! Besides, it\u2019ll all be worth it. We haven\u2019t done recital party in so long.\u201d She slides a cookie sheet into the oven. \u201cDaddy, I\u2019m going to need you to make a run to the store soon. We\u2019re out of sour cream and we need a big bag of ice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, aye, Captain,\u201d our dad says.</p><p>The only one of us Margot doesn\u2019t put to work is Jamie Fox-Pickle, who is taking a nap under the Christmas tree.</p><p>I\u2019m wearing a red-and-green plaid bow tie with a white button-down and a tartan skirt. I read on a fashion blog that mixing plaids is a thing. I go to Kitty\u2019s room to beg her to give me a braid crown, and she curls her lip at me and says, \u201cThat\u2019s not very sexy.\u201d</p><p>I frown. \u201cExcuse me? I wasn\u2019t trying to look sexy! I was trying to look festive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . you look like you\u2019re a Scottish waiter, or maybe a bartender at a bar in Brooklyn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you know about bartenders in Brooklyn, Katherine?\u201d I demand.</p><p>She gives me a withering look. \u201cDuh, I watch HBO.\u201d</p><p>Hmm. We might need to put some parental controls on the TV.</p><p>Kitty goes to my closet and pulls out my red off-the-shoulder knit dress with the swishy skirt. \u201cWear this. It\u2019s still Christmasy but less elf-costumey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, but I\u2019m putting my candy-cane pin on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, you can wear the pin. But leave your hair down. No braid.\u201d I give her my best sad pouty face, but Kitty shakes her head. \u201cI\u2019ll curl the ends to give it some body, but no braids of any kind.\u201d</p><p>I plug in the curling iron and sit on the floor with Jamie in my lap, and Kitty sits on the bed and sections my hair off. She wraps my hair around the barrel like a real pro. \u201cDid Josh RSVP yes to the party?\u201d she asks me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not coming,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just can\u2019t,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>Margot\u2019s at the piano playing \u201cBlue Christmas,\u201d and our old piano teacher Mr. Choi is sitting next to her singing along. Across the room, Daddy\u2019s showing off a new cactus to the Shahs from down the street, and Kitty and Josh and a few of the other little kids are trying to teach Jamie how to sit. I\u2019m sipping cranberry-and-ginger-ale punch and talking to Aunt D. about her divorce when Peter Kavinsky walks in wearing a hunter-green sweater with a button-down shirt underneath, carrying a Christmas tin. I almost choke on my punch.</p><p>Kitty spots him when I do. \u201cYou came!\u201d she cries. She runs right into his arms, and he puts down the cookie tin and picks her up and throws her around. When he sets her down, she takes him by the hand and over to the buffet table, where I\u2019m busying myself rearranging the cookie plate.</p><p>\u201cLook what Peter brought,\u201d she says, pushing him forward.</p><p>He hands me the cookie tin. \u201cHere. Fruitcake cookies my mom made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I whisper accusingly.</p><p>\u201cThe kid invited me.\u201d He jerks his head toward Kitty, who has conveniently run back over to the puppy. Josh is standing up now, looking over at us with a frown on his face. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>So now he wants to talk. Well, too late. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything to talk about.\u201d</p><p>Peter takes me by the elbow and I try to shake him off, but he won\u2019t let go. He steers me into the kitchen. \u201cI want you to make up an excuse to Kitty and leave,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd you can take your fruitcake cookies with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst tell me why you\u2019re so pissed at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause!\u201d I burst out. \u201cEveryone is saying how we had sex in the hot tub and I\u2019m a slut and you don\u2019t even care!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told the guys we didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you? Did you tell them that all we did was kiss and that\u2019s all we\u2019ve ever done?\u201d Peter hesitates, and I go on. \u201cOr did you say, \u2018Guys, we didn\u2019t have sex in the hot tub,\u2019 wink wink, nudge nudge.\u201d</p><p>Peter glares at me. \u201cGive me a little more credit than that, Covey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a scumbag, Kavinsky.\u201d</p><p>I spin around. There is Josh, in the doorway, glaring at Peter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your fault people are saying that crap about Lara Jean.\u201d Josh shakes his head in disgust. \u201cShe\u2019d never do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your voice down,\u201d I whisper, my eyes darting around. This is not happening right now. At recital party, with everyone I\u2019ve ever known my whole entire life in the next room.</p><p>Peter\u2019s jaw twitches. \u201cThis is a private conversation, Josh, between me and my girlfriend. Why don\u2019t you go play World of Warcraft or something. Or maybe there\u2019s a Lord of the Rings marathon on TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Kavinsky,\u201d Josh says. I gasp. To me Josh says, \u201cLara Jean, this is exactly what I\u2019ve been trying to protect you from. He\u2019s not good enough for you. He\u2019s only bringing you down.\u201d</p><p>Beside me Peter stiffens. \u201cGet over it! She doesn\u2019t like you anymore. It\u2019s over. Move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Josh says. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhatever, dude.

I pull Peter\u2019s arm back. \u201cStop it!\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when I see her. Margot, standing a few feet behind Josh, her hand to her mouth. The piano music has stopped, the world has stopped spinning, because Margot has heard everything.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not true, is it? Please tell me it\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>I open and close my mouth. I don\u2019t have to say anything, because she already knows. Margot who knows me so well.</p><p>\u201cHow could you?\u201d she asks, and her voice trembles. The hurt in her eyes makes me want to die. I\u2019ve never seen that look in her eyes before.</p><p>\u201cMargot,\u201d Josh begins, and she shakes her head and backs away.</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d she says, her voice breaking. Then she looks at me. \u201cYou\u2019re my sister. You\u2019re the person I trust more than anybody.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGogo, wait\u2014\u201d But she\u2019s already gone. I hear her feet run up the stairs. I hear her door shut and not slam.</p><p>And then I burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Josh says to me. Bleakly, he says, \u201cThis is all my fault.\u201d He walks out the back door.</p><p>Peter moves to put his arms around me, but I stop him. \u201cCan you just . . . can you just go?\u201d</p><p>Hurt and surprise register on his face. \u201cSure, I can go,\u201d he says, and he walks out of the kitchen.</p><p>I go to the bathroom off the side of the kitchen and sit on the toilet and cry. Someone knocks and I stop crying and call out, \u201cJust a minute.\u201d</p> <p>Mrs. Shah\u2019s cheery voice says, \u201cSorry, dear!\u201d and I hear her heels clack away.</p><p>Then I get up and splash cold water on my face. My eyes are still red and puffy. I run water over a hand towel and I wet my face with it. My mom used to do this for me when I was sick. She\u2019d put an ice-cold washcloth over my forehead and she\u2019d switch it out with a fresh one when it wasn\u2019t cold anymore. I wish my mom was here.</p><p>When I step back into the party, Mr. Choi is sitting at the piano playing \u201cHave Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,\u201d and Ms. Rothschild has my dad cornered on the couch. She\u2019s throwing back champagne, and he has a mildly startled look on his face. As soon he sees me, my dad jumps off the couch and over to me. \u201cOh, thank God,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere\u2019s Gogo? We haven\u2019t done our number yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t feel well,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHm. I\u2019ll go check on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she just wants to be left alone.\u201d</p><p>Daddy\u2019s forehead creases. \u201cDid she and Josh have a fight? I just saw him leave.\u201d</p><p>I swallow. \u201cMaybe. I\u2019ll go talk to her.\u201d</p> <p>He pats me on the shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re a good sister, honey.\u201d</p><p>I force a smile. \u201cThank you, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>I go upstairs and Margot\u2019s bedroom door is locked. I stand outside it and ask, \u201cCan I come inside?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Margot. Please just let me explain. . . .\u201d</p><p>Still nothing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Margot, I\u2019m so sorry. Please talk to me.\u201d</p><p>I sit down outside my door and start to cry. My big sister knows how to hurt me best. Silence from her, being shut out by her, is the worst punishment she could conjure up.</p><p>69</p><p>BEFORE MOMMY DIED, MARGOT AND I were enemies. We battled constantly, mostly because I was always messing up something of hers\u2014some game, some toy.</p><p>Margot had a doll she loved named Rochelle. Rochelle had silky auburn hair, and she wore glasses like Margot did. Mommy and Daddy had given her to her for her seventh birthday. Rochelle was Margot\u2019s only doll. She adored her. I remember begging Margot to let me hold her, just for a second, but Margot always said no. There was this one time, I had a cold, and I stayed home from school. I crept into Margot\u2019s room and I took Rochelle, I played with her all afternoon, I pretended Rochelle and I were best friends. I got it into my head that Rochelle\u2019s face was actually kind of plain; she would look better with lipstick on. It would be a favor to Margot if I made Rochelle more beautiful. I got one of Mommy\u2019s lipsticks out of her bathroom drawer and I put some on her lips. Right away I knew it was a mistake. I\u2019d drawn it on outside of her lip lines, she looked clownish, not sophisticated. So then I tried to clean off the lipstick with toothpaste, but it only made her look like she had a mouth disease. I hid under my blankets until Margot came home. When she found the state Rochelle was in, I heard Margot\u2019s scream.</p><p>After Mommy died, we all had to realign ourselves. Everybody had new roles. Margot and I were no longer locked in battle, because we both understood that Kitty was ours to take care of now. \u201cLook out for your sister,\u201d Mommy was always saying. When she was alive, we did it begrudgingly. After she was gone, we did it because we wanted to.</p><p>Days go by and still nothing. She looks through me, speaks to me only when necessary. Kitty watches us with worried eyes. Daddy is bewildered and asks what\u2019s going on with us, but doesn\u2019t push me for an answer.</p><p>There is a wall between us now, and I can feel her moving farther and farther away from me. Sisters are supposed to fight and make up, because they are sisters and sisters always find their way back to each other. But the thing that scares me is that maybe we won\u2019t.</p><p>70</p><p>OUTSIDE MY WINDOW, SNOW IS falling in clumps that look like cotton. The yard is starting to look like a cotton field. I hope it snows all day and all night. I hope it\u2019s a blizzard.</p><p>There\u2019s a knock at my door.</p><p>I lift my head up from my pillow. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>My dad comes in and sits down at my desk. \u201cSo,\u201d he says, scratching his chin the way he does when he\u2019s uncomfortable. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>My stomach drops. I sit up and wrap my arms around my knees. \u201cDid Margot tell you?\u201d</p><p>My dad clears his throat. \u201cShe did.\u201d I can\u2019t even look at him. \u201cThis is awkward. I never had to do this with Margot, so . . .\u201d He clears his throat again. \u201cYou\u2019d think I would be better at this since I\u2019m a health professional. I\u2019ll just say that I think you\u2019re too young to be having sex, Lara Jean. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready yet.\u201d He sounds like he\u2019s about to cry. \u201cDid . . . did Peter pressure you in any way?\u201d</p><p>I can feel all the blood rush to my face. \u201cDaddy, we didn\u2019t have sex.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nods, but I don\u2019t think he believes me. \u201cI\u2019m your dad, so of course I\u2019d rather you wait until you\u2019re fifty, but . . .\u201d He clears his throat again. \u201cI want you to be safe. I\u2019m making an appointment with Dr. Hudecz on Monday.\u201d</p><p>I start to cry. \u201cI don\u2019t need an appointment, because I\u2019m not doing anything! I didn\u2019t have sex! Not in the hot tub or anyplace. Somebody made the whole thing up. You have to believe me.\u201d</p><p>My dad has a pained expression on his face. \u201cLara Jean, I know it\u2019s not easy to talk about this with a dad and not a mom. I wish your mom was here to navigate us through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish she was too, because she\u2019d believe me.\u201d Tears are running down my cheeks. It\u2019s bad enough for strangers to think the worst of me, but I never thought my sister and dad would believe it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d My dad puts his arms around me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I do believe you. If you tell me you\u2019re not having sex, you\u2019re not having sex. I just don\u2019t want you to grow up too fast. When I look at you, you\u2019re still as young as Kitty to me. You\u2019re my little girl, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>I sag against him. There\u2019s no place safer than my dad\u2019s arms. \u201cEverything\u2019s a mess. You don\u2019t trust me anymore; Peter and I are broken up; Margot hates me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust you. Of course I trust you. And of course you and Margot will make up like you always do. She was only worried about you; that\u2019s why she came to me.\u201d No, it\u2019s not. She did it out of spite. It\u2019s her fault that Daddy thought that of me for even a second.</p><p>Daddy lifts my chin and wipes the tears off my face. \u201cYou must really like Peter, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I sob. \u201cMaybe. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>He tucks my hair behind my ears. \u201cEverything will work out.\u201d</p><p>There is a specific kind of fight you can only have with your sister. It\u2019s the kind where you say things you can\u2019t take back. You say them because you can\u2019t help but say them, because you\u2019re so angry it\u2019s coming up your throat and out your eyes; you\u2019re so angry you can\u2019t see straight. All you see is blood.</p><p>As soon as Daddy leaves and I hear him go to his room to get ready for bed, I barge into Margot\u2019s room without knocking. Margot is at her desk on her laptop. She looks up at me in surprise.</p><p>Wiping my eyes, I say, \u201cYou can be mad at me all you want, but you had no right to go to Daddy behind my back.\u201d</p><p>Her voice is piano-string tight as she says, \u201cI didn\u2019t do that as revenge. I did it because you clearly have no idea what you\u2019re doing, and if you\u2019re not careful, you\u2019re going to end up some sad teenage statistic.\u201d Coldly, as if she is speaking to a stranger, Margot continues. \u201cYou\u2019ve changed, Lara Jean. I honestly don\u2019t even know who you are anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you definitely don\u2019t know me anymore, if you think for one second that I would have sex on a school trip! In a hot tub, in plain view of anybody who might happen to walk by? You must not know me at all!\u201d And then I lay it down, the card I\u2019ve been holding against her. \u201cJust because you had sex with Josh, that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to have sex with Peter.\u201d</p> <p>Margot sucks in her breath. \u201cLower your voice.\u201d</p><p>I feel happy that I\u2019ve wounded her too. I yell, \u201cNow that Daddy\u2019s already disappointed in me, he can\u2019t be disappointed in you, too, right?\u201d</p><p>I whirl around to go back to my room, and Margot follows close behind me.</p><p>\u201cCome back here!\u201d she shouts.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I try to close my door in her face, but she wedges her foot inside. \u201cGet out!\u201d</p><p>I lean my back against the door, but Margot is stronger than me. She pushes her way in and locks the door behind her.</p><p>She advances toward me and I back away from her. There\u2019s a dangerous light in her eyes. She\u2019s the righteous one now. I can feel myself start to shrink, to cower. \u201cHow did you know Josh and I had sex, Lara Jean? Did he tell you that himself while you two were going behind my back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe never went behind your back! It wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen what was it like?\u201d she demands.</p><p>A sob escapes my throat. \u201cI liked him first. I liked him all that summer before ninth grade. I thought . . . thought he liked me back. But then one day you said you were dating, and so I just, I just swallowed it. I wrote him a good-bye letter.\u201d</p><p>Margot\u2019s face twists into a sneer. \u201cDo you seriously expect me to feel sorry for you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m just trying to explain what happened. I stopped liking him, I swear I did. I didn\u2019t think of him like that again, but then, after you left, I realized that deep down I still had feelings for him. And then my letter got sent and Josh found out, so I started pretend dating Peter\u2014\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cJust stop. I don\u2019t want to hear it. I don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re talking about right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosh and I only kissed one time. Once. And it was a huge mistake, and I didn\u2019t even want to do it in the first place! You\u2019re the one he loves, not me.\u201d</p><p>She says, \u201cHow can I believe anything you ever say to me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s the truth.\u201d Trembling, I tell her, \u201cYou have no idea the power you have over me. How much your opinion means to me. How much I look up to you.\u201d</p><p>Margot\u2019s face screws up like a fist; she is holding back tears. \u201cYou know what Mommy would always say to me?\u201d She lifts her chin higher. \u201c?\u2018Take care of your sisters.\u2019 So that\u2019s what I did. I\u2019ve always tried to put you and Kitty first. Do you have any idea how hard it was being so far away from you guys? How lonely it was? All I wanted to do was come back home, but I couldn\u2019t, because I have to be strong. I have to be\u201d\u2014she struggles for a breath\u2014\u201cthe good example. I can\u2019t be weak. I have to show you guys how to be brave. Because . . . because Mommy isn\u2019t here to do it.\u201d</p><p>Tears roll down my cheeks. \u201cI know. You don\u2019t have to tell me, Gogo. I know how much you do for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then I left, and it\u2019s like you didn\u2019t need me as much as I thought.\u201d Her voice breaks. \u201cYou were fine without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because you taught me everything!\u201d I cry out.</p><p>Margot\u2019s face crumbles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I weep. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI needed you, Lara Jean.\u201d</p><p>She takes one step toward me and I take one toward her, and we fall into each other\u2019s arms, crying, and the relief I feel is immeasurable. We are sisters, and there\u2019s nothing she or I can ever say or do to change that.</p><p>Daddy knocks on the door. \u201cGirls? Everything okay in there?\u201d</p><p>We look at each other and together at the same time, we say, \u201cWe\u2019re fine, Daddy.\u201d</p> <p>71</p><p>IT\u2019S NEW YEAR\u2019S EVE. NEW year\u2019s eve has always been a stay-at-home holiday for us. We make popcorn and drink sparkling cider, and at midnight we go outside to the backyard and light up sparklers.</p><p>Some of Margot\u2019s friends from high school are having a party at a cabin in the mountains, and she said she wasn\u2019t going to go, that she\u2019d rather stay with us, but Kitty and I made her. My hope is that Josh is going too, and that they\u2019ll talk, and who knows what will happen. It\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve, after all. The night for new beginnings.</p><p>We sent Daddy to a party someone from the hospital is throwing. Kitty ironed his favorite button-down shirt and I picked the tie and we shoved him out the door. I think Grandma is right; it\u2019s not good to be alone.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you still sad?\u201d Kitty asks me as I dump popcorn into a bowl for us. We\u2019re in the kitchen; she\u2019s sitting on a stool at the breakfast bar with her legs dangling. The puppy is curled up like a centipede under her stool, gazing up at Kitty with hopeful eyes. \u201cYou and Margot made up. What\u2019s to be sad about?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m about to deny being sad, but then I just sigh and say, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Kitty grabs a handful of popcorn and drops a few kernels on the floor, which Jamie gobbles up. \u201cHow can you not know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause sometimes you just feel sad and you can\u2019t explain it.\u201d</p><p>Kitty cocks her head to the side. \u201cPMS?\u201d</p><p>I count the days since my last period. \u201cNo. It\u2019s not PMS. Just because a girl is sad, it doesn\u2019t mean it has anything to do with PMS.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d she presses.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know! Maybe I miss someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou miss Peter? Or Josh?\u201d</p><p>I hesitate. \u201cPeter.\u201d Despite everything, Peter.</p><p>\u201cSo call him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know how to answer her. It\u2019s all so embarrassing, and I want to be someone she can look up to. But she\u2019s waiting, her little brow furrowed, and I know I have to tell her the truth. \u201cKitty, it was all fake. The whole thing. We were never really together. He never really liked me.\u201d</p><p>Kitty wrinkles. \u201cWhat do you mean it was fake?\u201d</p> <p>Sighing, I say, \u201cIt all started with those letters. Remember how my hatbox went missing?\u201d Kitty nods. \u201cI had letters inside, letters I wrote to the boys I loved. They were supposed to be private, they were never supposed to be sent, but then somebody did, and everything turned into a mess. Josh got one, and Peter got one, and I was just so humiliated. . . . Peter and I decided to pretend to date so I could save face in front of Josh and he could make his ex-girlfriend jealous, and the whole thing just spun out of control.\u201d</p><p>Kitty is biting her lip nervously. \u201cLara Jean . . . if I tell you something, you have to promise not to be mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Just tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I promise I won\u2019t be mad.\u201d Prickles are going up my spine.</p><p>In a rush Kitty says, \u201cI\u2019m the one who sent the letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I scream.</p><p>\u201cYou promised you wouldn\u2019t be mad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I scream again, but less loud. \u201cKitty, how could you do that to me?\u201d</p><p>She hangs her head. \u201cBecause I was mad at you. You were teasing me about liking Josh; you said I was going to name my dog after him. I was so mad at you. So when you were sleeping . . . I snuck into your room and stole your hatbox and I read all your letters and then I sent them. I regretted it right away, but it was too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you even know about my letters?\u201d I yell.</p><p>She squints at me. \u201cBecause I go through your stuff sometimes when you\u2019re not at home.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m about to scream at her some more, and then I remember how I read Margot\u2019s letter from Josh and I bite my tongue. As calmly as I can, I say, \u201cDo you even know how much trouble you\u2019ve caused? How could you be so spiteful to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispers. Fat teardrops form in the corners of her eyes, and one plops down like a raindrop.</p><p>I want to hug her, to comfort her, but I\u2019m still so mad. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I say in a voice that is the exact opposite of fine. None of this would have happened if she hadn\u2019t sent those letters.</p><p>Kitty jumps up and runs upstairs, and I think she\u2019s going to her room to cry in private. I know what I should do. I should go comfort her, forgive her for real. It\u2019s my turn to be the good example. To be the good big sister.</p><p>I\u2019m about to go upstairs when she comes running back into the kitchen. With my hatbox in her arms.</p><p>72</p><p>WHEN IT WAS JUST MARGOT and me, my mom used to buy two of everything, blue for Margot and pink for me. The same quilt, stuffed animal, or Easter basket in two different colors. Everything had to be fair; we had to have the exact same number of carrot sticks or french fries or marbles or erasers shaped like cupcakes. Except I was always losing my erasers or eating my carrot sticks too fast, and then I\u2019d beg for just one of Margot\u2019s. Sometimes Mommy would make her share, which even then I realized wasn\u2019t fair, that obviously, Margot shouldn\u2019t be penalized for eating her snack slowly or keeping track of her erasers. After Kitty was born, Mommy tried to do blue, pink, and yellow, but it\u2019s just a lot harder finding one thing in three different colors. Also, Kitty was enough years younger than us that we didn\u2019t want the same kinds of toys as her.</p><p>The teal hatbox might be the only gift from Mommy I got that was just for me. I didn\u2019t have to share it; this one was mine and mine alone.</p><p>When I opened it, I expected to find a hat, maybe a straw hat with a floppy brim, or maybe a newsboy\u2014but it was empty. \u201cThis is for your special things,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can put all your most precious, most favorite, most secret things in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhatever fits inside. Whatever you want to keep just for you.\u201d</p><p>Kitty\u2019s pointy little chin trembles, and she says, \u201cI really am sorry, Lara Jean.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I see that, the chin tremble, I can\u2019t be mad anymore. I just can\u2019t, not even a little bit. So I go to her, and I hug her tight. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I say, and she sags against me in relief. \u201cYou can keep the box. Put all your secrets in it.\u201d</p><p>Kitty shakes her head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s yours. I don\u2019t want it.\u201d She thrusts it at me. \u201cI put something in there for you.\u201d</p><p>I open the box, and there are notes. Notes and notes and notes. Peter\u2019s notes. Peter\u2019s notes I threw away.</p><p>\u201cI found them when I was emptying your trash,\u201d she says. Hastily she adds, \u201cI only read a couple. And then I saved them because I could tell they were important.\u201d</p> <p>I touch one that Peter folded into an airplane. \u201cKitty . . . you know Peter and I aren\u2019t getting back together, right?\u201d</p><p>Kitty grabs the bowl of popcorn and says, \u201cJust read them.\u201d Then she goes into the living room and turns on the TV.</p><p>I close the hatbox and take it with me upstairs. When I am in my room, I sit on the floor and spread them out around me.</p><p>A lot of the notes just say things like \u201cMeet you at your locker after school\u201d and \u201cCan I borrow your chemistry notes from yesterday?\u201d I find the spiderweb one from Halloween, and it makes me smile. Another one says, \u201cCan you take the bus home today? I want to surprise Kitty and pick her up from school so she can show me and my car off to her friends.\u201d \u201cThanks for coming to the estate sale with me this weekend. You made the day fun. I owe you one.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t forget to pack a Korean yogurt for me!\u201d \u201cIf you make Josh\u2019s dumb white-chocolate cranberry cookies and not my fruitcake ones, it\u2019s over.\u201d I laugh out loud. And then, the one I read over and over: \u201cYou look pretty today. I like you in blue.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never gotten a love letter before. But reading these notes like this, one after the other, it feels like I have. It\u2019s like . . . it\u2019s like there\u2019s only ever been Peter. Like everyone else that came before him, they were all to prepare me for this. I think I see the difference now, between loving someone from afar and loving someone up close. When you see them up close, you see the real them, but they also get to see the real you. And Peter does. He sees me, and I see him.</p> <p>Love is scary: it changes; it can go away. That\u2019s part of the risk. I don\u2019t want to be scared anymore. I want to be brave, like Margot. It\u2019s almost a new year, after all.</p><p>Close to midnight, I gather up Kitty and the puppy and the sparklers. We put on heavy coats and I make Kitty wear a hat. \u201cShould we put a hat on Jamie too?\u201d she asks me.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need one,\u201d I tell her. \u201cHe\u2019s already got on a fur coat.\u201d</p><p>The stars are out by the dozen; they look like faraway gems. We\u2019re so lucky to live by the mountains the way we do. You just feel closer to the stars. To heaven.</p><p>I light up sparklers for each of us, and Kitty starts dancing around the snow making a ring of fire with hers. She\u2019s trying to coax Jamie to jump through but he isn\u2019t having it. All he wants to do is pee around the yard. It\u2019s lucky we have a fence, or I bet he\u2019d pee his way down this whole block.</p><p>Josh\u2019s bedroom light is on. I see him in the window just as he opens it and calls out, \u201cSong girls!\u201d</p> <p>Kitty hollers, \u201cWanna light a sparkler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe next year,\u201d Josh calls back. I look up at him and wave my sparkler, and he smiles, and there\u2019s just this feeling of all rightness between us. One way or another, Josh will be in our lives. And I\u2019m certain, I\u2019m so suddenly certain that everything is exactly the way it\u2019s supposed to be, that I don\u2019t have to be so afraid of good-bye, because good-bye doesn\u2019t have to be forever.</p><p>When I\u2019m back in my room in my flannel nightgown, I get out my special flowy pen and my good thick stationery, and I start to write. Not a good-bye letter. Just a plain old love letter.</p><p>Dear Peter . . .</p>  </body></html>"]
