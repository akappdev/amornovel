I slide the door down and pull the latch shut, locking up eighteen years of memories, all of which include my dad.</p><p>It's been six months since he passed away. Long enough that my nine-year-old brother, Kel, doesn't cry every time we talk about him, but recent enough that we\u2019re being forced to accept the financial aftermath that comes with a newly single parented household. A household that couldn't afford to remain in Texas and in the only home I've ever known.</p><p>\"Lake, stop being such a downer,\" my mom says as she hands me the keys to the house. \"I think you'll love Michigan.\"</p><p>She never seems to call me by the name she legally gave me. She and my dad argued for nine months over what I would be named. She loved the name Layla, after the Eric Clapton song. Dad loved the name Kennedy, after a Kennedy. \"It doesn't matter which Kennedy,\" he would say. \"I love them all!\"</p> <p>I was almost three days old before the hospital finally forced them to decide. They agreed to take the first three letters of both names and compromised on Layken, but neither of them has ever once referred to me as such.</p><p>I mimic my mother's tone, \"Mom, stop being such an upper! I'm going to hate Michigan.\"</p><p>My mother has always had an ability to deliver an entire lecture with a single glance. I get the glance.</p><p>I walk up the porch steps and head inside the house to make a walkthrough before the final turn of the key. All of the rooms are eerily empty. It doesn't seem as though I'm walking through the same house where I've lived since the day I was born. These last six months have been a whirlwind of emotions, all of them low. Moving out of this home was inevitable, I realize that. I just expected it to come after the end of my senior year.</p><p>I'm standing in what is no longer our kitchen when I catch a glimpse of a purple plastic hair clip exposed under the cabinet in the space where the refrigerator once stood. I pick it up, wipe the dust off of it and run it back and forth between my fingers.</p><p>\u201cIt'll grow back,\u201d Dad said.</p> <p>I was five years old and my mother had left her trimming scissors on the bathroom counter. Apparently, I had done what most kids of that age do. I cut my own hair.</p><p>\u201cMommy's going to be so mad at me,\u201d I cried. I thought that if I cut my hair, it would immediately grow back and no one would notice. I cut a pretty wide chunk out of my bangs and sat in front of the mirror for probably an hour, waiting for it to grow back. I picked the straight brown strands up off the floor and held them in my hand, contemplating how I could secure them back to my head, when I began to cry.</p><p>When dad walked into the bathroom and saw what I had done he just laughed and scooped me up, then positioned me on the countertop. \u201cMommy's not going to notice, Lake\u201d he promised as he removed something out of the bathroom cabinet. \"I just happen to have a piece of magic right here.\" He opened up his palm and revealed the purple clip. \"As long as you have this in your hair, Mommy will never know.\" He brushed the remaining strands of hair across and secured the clip in place. He then turned me around to face the mirror. \"See? Good as new!\"</p><p>I looked at our reflection in the mirror and felt like the luckiest girl in the world. I didn't know of any other dad that had magic clips.</p><p>I wore that clip in my hair every day for two months and my mother never once mentioned it. Now that I look back on it, I realize he more than likely told her what I had done. But when I was five, I believed in his magic.</p><p>I look more like my mother than I did him. Mom and I are both of average height. After having two kids she can\u2019t really fit into my jeans, but we are pretty good at sharing everything else. We both have brown hair that, depending on the weather, is either straight or wavy. Her eyes are a deeper emerald than mine, although it could be that the paleness of her skin just makes them more prominent.</p><p>I favor my dad in all the ways that count. We had the same dry sense of humor, the same personality, the same love of music, the same laugh. Kel is a different story. He took after our dad in the physical aspect with his dirty blond hair and soft features. He\u2019s on the small side for nine years old, but his personality makes up for what he lacks physically.</p><p>I walk to the sink and turn it on, rubbing my thumb over the thirteen years of grime collected on the hair clip. Kel walks backwards into the kitchen, just as I'm drying my hands on my jeans. He\u2019s a strange kid, but I couldn\u2019t love him more. He has a game he likes to play which he calls \u2018backwards day\u2019 where he spends most of the time walking everywhere backwards, talking backwards and even requests dessert first. I guess with such a big age difference and no other siblings, he has to find a way to entertain himself somehow.</p> <p>\u201cHurry to says Mom Layken!\u201d he says, backwards.</p><p>I place the hair clip in the pocket of my jeans and head back out the door, locking up my home for the very last time.</p><p>Over the course of the next few days my mother and I alternate between driving my jeep and the U-Haul, stopping only twice at hotels to sleep. Kel switches between Mom and me, riding the final day with me in the U-Haul. We complete the last exhausting nine-hour stretch throughout the night, only stopping once for a short break. As we close in on our new town of Ypsilanti, I take in my surroundings and the fact that it's September but my heater is on. I'll definitely need a new wardrobe.</p><p>As I make a final right-hand turn onto our street, my GPS informs me that I've \"reached my destination.\"</p><p>\"My destination,\" I laugh aloud to myself. My GPS doesn't know squat.</p><p>The cul-de-sac is not very long, lined with about eight single story brick houses on each side of the street. There's a basketball goal in one of the driveways, which gives me hope that Kel might have someone to play with. Honestly, it looks like a decent neighborhood. The lawns are manicured, the sidewalks are clean, but there's too much concrete. Way too much concrete. I already miss home.</p><p>Our new landlord e-mailed us pictures of the house so I immediately spot which one is ours. It's small. It's really small. We had a ranch-style home in Texas on several acres of land. The miniscule amount of land surrounding this home is almost nothing but concrete and garden gnomes. The front door is propped open and I see an older man who I assume is our new landlord come outside and wave.</p><p>I drive past the house about fifty yards so that I can back into the driveway where the rear of the U-Haul will face the front door. Before I put the gear shift in reverse, I reach over and shake Kel awake. He's been passed out since Indiana.</p><p>\"Kel, wake up,\" I whisper. \"We've reached our destination.\"</p><p>He stretches his legs out and yawns, then leans his forehead against the window to get a look at our new home. \u201cHey, there's a kid in the yard!\u201d Kel says. \"Do you think he lives in our house too?\u201d</p><p>\"He better not,\" I reply. \"But he's probably a neighbor. Hop out and go introduce yourself while I back up.\"</p><p>When the U-Haul is successfully backed in, I put the gear shift in park, roll down the windows, and kill the engine. My mother pulls in beside me in my jeep. I watch as she gets out and greets the landlord. I crouch down a few inches in the seat and prop my foot against the dash. I lean my head back and watch Kel and his new friend sword fight with imaginary swords in the street. I'm jealous of him. Jealous of the fact that he can accept the move so easily, and I'm stuck being the angry, bitter child.</p><p>He was upset when mom first decided on the move. Mostly because he was in the middle of his little league season. He had friends he would miss, but at the age of nine your best friend is usually imaginary, and transatlantic. Mom subdued him pretty easily by promising he could sign up for hockey, something he wanted to do in Texas. It was a hard sport to come by in the rural south. After she agreed, he was pretty upbeat, if not stoked about Michigan.</p><p>I understand why we had to move. Dad had made a respectable living managing a paint store. Mom worked PRN as a nurse when she needed to, but mostly tended to the house and to us. About a month after he died, she was able to find a full-time job. I could see the stress of my father's death taking its toll on her, along with being the new head of household.</p><p>One night over dinner, she explained to us that she wasn't left with enough income to continue paying all the bills and the mortgage. She said there was a job that could pay her more, but we would have to move. She was offered a job from her old high school friend, Brenda. They grew up together in my mother's hometown of Ypsilanti, right outside of Detroit. It paid more than anything she could find in Texas, so she had no choice but to accept. I don't blame her for the move. My grandparents are deceased and she has no one to help her. I understand why we had to do it, but understanding a situation doesn't always make it easier.</p><p>\"Layken, you're dead!\" Kel shouts through the open window as he thrusts his imaginary sword into my neck. He waits for me to slump over, but I just roll my eyes at him. \"I stabbed you. You're supposed to die!\" he says.</p><p>\"Believe me, I'm already dead,\" I mumble as I open the door and climb out. Kel's shoulders are slumped forward and he's staring down at the concrete, his imaginary sword limp by his side. Kel\u2019s new friend stands behind him looking just as defeated, causing me to immediately regret the transference of my bad mood.</p><p>\"I'm already dead,\u201d I say in my best monster voice, \u201cbecause I'm a zombie!\u201d</p><p>They start screaming as I stretch my arms out in front of me, cock my head to the side and make a gurgling sound. \u201cBrains!\u201d I grumble as I walk stiff legged after them around the U-Haul. \u201cBrains!\u201d</p><p>I slowly round the front of the U-Haul holding my arms out in front of me when I notice someone holding my brother and his new friend by the collars of their shirts.</p><p>\u201cGet \u2018em!\u201d The stranger yells as he holds the two screaming boys.</p><p>He looks a couple of years older than me and quite a bit taller. \"Hot\" would be how most girls would describe him, but I\u2019m not most girls. The boys are flailing around and his muscles flex under his sleeves as he tries hard to hold onto them.</p><p>Unlike Kel and I, it's unmistakable these two are siblings. Aside from the obvious age difference, they're identical. They both have smooth olive skin, the same jet black hair, even the same cropped hair style. He's laughing as Kel breaks free and starts slicing at him with his \"sword.\" He looks up at me and mouths \"help,\" when I realize I'm still frozen in my zombie pose.</p><p>My first instinct is to crawl back inside the U-Haul and hide in the floor for the remainder of my life. Instead, I yell \"Brains\" once more and lunge forward, pretending to bite the younger boy on top of his head. I grab Kel and his new friend and start tickling them until they melt into heaps on the concrete driveway.</p><p>As I straighten up, the older brother extends his hand. \u201cHey, I'm Will. We live across the street,\" he says as he points to the house directly across from ours.</p><p>I reciprocate his handshake. \"I'm Layken. I guess I live here,\" I say as I glance to the house behind me.</p><p>He smiles. Our handshake lingers as neither one of us says anything. I hate awkward moments. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Well, welcome to Ypsilanti,\" he says as he pulls his hand from mine and puts it in his jacket pocket. \"Where are you guys moving here from?\"</p><p>\"Texas?\" I reply. I'm not sure why the tail end of my reply comes out like a question. I'm not sure why I'm even analyzing why it came out like a question. I'm not sure why I'm analyzing the reason why I'm analyzing-I'm flustered. It must be the lack of sleep I've gotten over the past three days.</p><p>\"Texas, huh?\" he says. He's rocking back and forth on his heels. The awkwardness intensifies as I fail to respond. He glances down at his brother and bends over, grabbing him by the ankles. \"I've got to get this little guy to school,\" he says as he swings his brother up and over his shoulders. \"There\u2019s a cold front coming through tonight. You should try to get as much unloaded today as you can. It\u2019s supposed to last a few days so if you guys need help unloading this afternoon, let me know. We should be home around four.\"</p><p>\"Sure, thanks,\" I say as they head across the street. I'm still watching them when Kel stabs me in my lower back. I drop to my knees and clutch at my stomach, crouching forward as Kel climbs on top of me and finishes me off. I glance across the street again and see Will watching us as he shuts his brother's door then walks around to the driver's side door. He waves goodbye as he climbs inside the car.</p> <p>It takes us most of the day to unload all of the boxes and furniture. Our landlord helps move the larger items that mom and I can't lift on our own. We're too tired to get to the boxes inside the jeep and agree to put it off until tomorrow. I'm a little disappointed when the U-Haul is finally empty; I no longer have an excuse to solicit Will's help.</p><p>As soon as my bed is put together, I start grabbing boxes labeled with my name on them from the hallway. I get most of them unpacked and my bed made when I notice the furniture in my bedroom casting shadows across the walls. I look out my window and the sun is setting. Either the days are a lot shorter here, or I've lost track of time.</p><p>In the kitchen, I find Mom and Kel unloading dishes into the cabinets. I climb into one of the six tall chairs at the bar, which also doubles as the dining room table due to the lack of dining room. There isn't much to this house. When you walk through the front door, there's a small entryway followed by the living room. The living room is separated from the kitchen by nothing more than a hallway to the left and a window to the right. The living room's beige carpet is edged by hard wood that leads throughout the rest of the house.</p><p>\"Everything is so clean here,\u201d my mother says as she continues putting away dishes. \"I haven't seen a single insect.\"</p><p>Texas has more insects than blades of grass. If you aren't swatting flies, you're killing wasps.</p> <p>\"That's one good thing about Michigan, I guess,\u201d I reply. I open up a box of pizza in front of me and eye the selection.</p><p>\"One good thing?\" she says as she winks at me. She leans across the bar, grabs a pepperoni and pops it in her mouth. \"I\u2019d think that would be at least two good things.\"</p><p>I pretend I\u2019m not following.</p><p>\"I saw you talking to that boy this morning,\" she says with a smile.</p><p>\"Oh, please Mom,\" I reply as indifferently as I can get away with. \"I'm pretty positive we'll find it no surprise that Texas isn't the only state inhabited by the male species.\" I walk to the refrigerator and grab a soda.</p><p>\"What\u2019s anabited?\" Kel asks.</p> <p>\"Inhabited,\" I correct him. \"It means to occupy, dwell, reside, populate, squat, live.\" My SAT prep courses are paying off.</p><p>\"Oh, kinda like how we anabited Ypsilanti?\" he says.</p><p>\"Inhabited,\" I correct him again. I finish my slice of pizza and take another sip of the soda. \"I'm beat, guys. I'm going to bed.\"</p><p>\"You mean you\u2019re going to inhabit your bedroom?\" Kel says.</p><p>\"You're a quick learner, young grasshopper.\" I bend and kiss the top of his head and retreat to my room.</p><p>It feels so good to crawl under the covers. At least my bed is familiar. I close my eyes and try to imagine that I'm in my old bedroom. My old,warm bedroom. My sheets and pillow are ice cold, so I pull the covers over my head to generate some heat. Note to self: locate the thermostat first thing in the morning.</p><p>And that's exactly what I set out to do as soon as I crawl out of bed and my bare feet meet the ice cold floor beneath them. I grab a sweater out of my closet and throw it on over my sweats and tank top while I search for socks. It\u2019s a futile attempt. I quietly tiptoe down the hallway, trying not to wake anyone while at the same time attempting to expose the least amount of foot as possible to the coldness of the hard wood. As I pass Kel's room, I spot his Darth Vader house shoes on the floor. I sneak in and slip them on, finally finding some relief as I head into the kitchen.</p><p>I look around for the coffee pot, but don't find it. I remember packing it in the jeep, which is unfortunate since the jeep is parked outside. Outside in this absurdly cold weather.</p> <p>The jackets are nowhere to be found. Septembers in Texas rarely call for jackets. I grab the keys and decide I'll just have to make a mad dash to the jeep. I open the front door and some sort of white substance is all over the yard. It takes me a second to realize what it is. Snow? In September? I bend down and scoop some up in my hands and examine it. It doesn't snow that often in Texas, but when it does it isn't this kind of snow. Texas snow is more like miniscule pieces of rock-hard hail. Michigan snow is just how I imagined real snow would be: fluffy, soft, and cold! I quickly drop the snow and dry my hands on my sweatshirt as I head toward the jeep.</p><p>I don't make it far. The second my Darth Vader house shoes meet the snow dusted concrete, I'm no longer looking at the jeep in front of me. I'm flat on my back, staring up at the clear blue sky. I immediately feel the pain in my right shoulder and realize I've landed on something hard. I reach around and pull a concrete garden gnome out from beneath me, half of his red hat broken off and shattered into pieces. He's smirking at me. I groan and raise the gnome with my good arm and pull it back, preparing to chuck the thing, when someone stops me.</p><p>\"That's not a good idea!\"</p><p>I immediately recognize Will\u2019s voice. His voice is smooth and soothing like my father\u2019s was, but at the same time had an authoritative edge to it. I sit upright and see Will walking up the driveway toward me.</p><p>\"Are you okay?\" he laughs.</p><p>Oh, no. I haven't even looked in the mirror this morning. I'm immediately embarrassed, but do my best to appear anything but.</p><p>\"I'll feel a lot better after I bust this damn thing,\" I say, trying to pull myself up with no success.</p><p>\"You don't want to do that, gnomes are good luck,\" he says as he reaches me. He takes the gnome out of my hands and gently places it on the snow covered grass.</p><p>\"Yeah,\" I reply sarcastically as I take in the gash on my shoulder that has now formed a bright red circle on my sweater sleeve. \"Real good luck.\"</p><p>Will stops laughing when he sees the blood on my shirt. \"Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I wouldn't have laughed if I knew you were hurt.\" He bends over and takes my uninjured arm and pulls me up. \"You need to get a bandage on that.\"</p><p>\"I wouldn't have a clue where to find one at this point,\" I reply, referring to the mounds of unopened boxes we have yet to unpack.</p><p>\"You'll have to walk with me. There\u2019s some in our kitchen.\"</p><p>He removes his jacket and wraps it around my shoulders, holding onto my arm as he walks me across the street. I feel a little pathetic with him assisting me-I can walk on my own. I don't object though, and I feel hypocritical to the entire feminist movement. I've regressed to the damsel in distress.</p><p>I remove his jacket and lay it across the back of the couch as I follow him into the kitchen. It's still dark inside so I assume everyone is still asleep. His house is more spacious than ours. The open floor plans are similar but the living room seems to be a few feet larger. There's a bay window to the left of the living room with a sitting bench and large pillows.</p><p>Several family pictures hang along the wall opposite the kitchen. Most of them are of Will and his little brother with a few pictures that include his parents.</p><p>I walk over to inspect the pictures as Will looks for a bandage. They must have gotten their genes from their dad. In the most recent picture, which still looks a few years dated, his dad has his arms around the two boys and he's squeezing them together for an impromptu photo. His jet black hair is speckled with gray and a thick black moustache outlines his huge smile. His features are identical to Will's. They both have eyes that smile when they laugh, exposing perfect white teeth.</p><p>Will\u2019s mother is breathtaking. She has long blond hair and, from the pictures at least, looks tall. I can\u2019t pick out any facial features of hers that were passed on to her boys. Maybe Will has her personality. All of the pictures on the wall prove one big difference between our houses-this one is a home.</p><p>I walk into the kitchen and take a seat at the bar.</p><p>\"It needs to be cleaned before you put the bandage on it,\" he says as he rolls up his shirt sleeves and turns on the faucet. He\u2019s wearing a pale yellow button-up collared shirt that is slightly transparent under the kitchen lights, revealing the outline of his undershirt. He has broad shoulders and his sleeves are snug around the muscles in his arms. The top of his head meets the cabinet above him and I estimate from the similarities in our kitchens that he stands about six inches taller than me. I\u2019m staring at the pattern on his black tie that\u2019s flipped over his shoulder in an attempt to avoid getting it wet, when he turns the water off and walks back to the bar. I feel my face flush as I grab the wet napkin out of his hands, not proud of the amount of attention his physique is getting from me.</p><p>\"It's fine,\" I say as I pull my sleeve down over my shoulder. \"I can get it.\"</p><p>He opens a bandage as I wipe the blood off the wound. \"So, what were you doing outside in your pajamas at seven o'clock in the morning?\" he asks. \"Are you guys still unloading?\"</p><p>I shake my head and lean over and throw the napkin into the trash can. \"Coffee.\"</p><p>\"Coffee? I guess you aren't a morning person.\" Will says this as more of a statement than a question.</p><p>As he moves in closer to place the bandage on my shoulder, I can feel his breath on my neck. I rub my arms to hide the chills that are creeping up them. He adheres it to my shoulder and pats it.</p><p>\"There. Good as new,\" he says.</p><p>\"Thanks. And I am a morning person,\" I say. \"After I get my coffee.\" I stand up and look over my shoulder, pretending to inspect the bandage as I plot my next move. I already thanked him. I could turn and walk out now, but that would seem rude after he just helped me. If I just stand here waiting on him to make more small talk, I might look stupid for not leaving. I don't understand why I'm even contemplating basic actions around him. He's just another inhabitant!</p><p>When I turn around, he's at the counter pouring a cup of coffee. He walks toward me and sets it on the counter in front of me. \"You want cream or sugar?\"</p><p>I shake my head. \"Black is fine. Thanks,\" I say as I pick up the cup and take a sip.</p><p>He's leaning across the bar watching me as I drink the coffee. His eyes are the exact same hue of deep green as his mothers are from the picture. I guess he did get a feature from her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He smiles and breaks our gaze by looking down at his watch. \"I need to go, my brother is waiting in the car and I\u2019ve got to get to work,\" he says. \"I'll walk you back. You can keep the cup.\"</p><p>I look at the cup before taking another sip and notice the big letters emblazoned on the side. World's Greatest Dad. It's the exact same cup my father used to drink coffee from.</p><p>\"I'll be okay,\" I say as I head toward the front door. \"I think I've got the whole walking erect thing down now.\"</p><p>He follows me outside and shuts his front door behind him, insisting I take his jacket with me. I pull it on over my shoulders, thank him again, then head across the street.</p> <p>\u201cLayken!\u201d he yells just as I'm about to walk back inside my house. I turn back toward him and he's standing in his driveway.</p><p>\u201cMay the force be with you!\" He laughs and hops into his car and backs out of the driveway as I stand there, staring down at the Darth Vader house shoes I'm still sporting. Classic.</p><p>The coffee helps. I locate the thermostat and by lunch the house has finally started to warm up. Mom and Kel are gone to the utility company to get everything switched into her name and I\u2019m left with the last of the boxes, if you don't count what\u2019s still in the jeep. I get a few more things unpacked and decide it's high time for a shower. I'm pretty sure I'm closing in on day three of my granola girl look.</p><p>I get out of the shower and wrap myself in a towel; flipping my hair forward as I brush it out and blow dry it. When it's dry, I point the blow dryer at the fogged up mirror, forming a clear circular area so that I can apply a little makeup. I notice my tan has started to fade. There won't be much laying out here so I might as well get used to a slightly paler complexion.</p><p>I brush my hair and pull it back into a ponytail and put on some lip-gloss and mascara. I forego the blush since there no longer seems to be a need for it anymore. Between the weather and my brief encounters with Will my cheeks seem to stay red.</p> <p>I search my closet and find a long sleeved shirt and throw it on with some jeans and the socks I wasn't able to find this morning. The only shoes I find that are weather appropriate are a pair of thin black boots. I slide them on and zip them up over my pant legs.</p><p>Mom and Kel have already come and gone while I was in the shower. There is a note from her informing me she and Kel are following her friend Brenda into the city to return the U-Haul. Three twenty-dollar bills are on the counter next to the car keys and a grocery list. I snatch them up and head to the jeep, reaching it successfully this time.</p><p>I realize as I'm putting the car into reverse that I have absolutely no idea where I'm going. I know nothing about this town, much less whether I need to turn left or right off of my own street. Will's little brother is in their front yard so I pull the car up parallel to their curb and roll down my passenger window.</p><p>\u201cHey, come here for a sec!\u201d I yell at him.</p><p>He looks at me and hesitates. Maybe he thinks I'm going to bust out in Zombie mode again. He walks toward the car, but stops three feet short of the window.</p><p>\"How do I get to the closest grocery store?\" I ask him.</p> <p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cSeriously? I'm nine.\"</p><p>Okay. So the resemblance to his brother is only skin deep.</p><p>\"Well, thanks for nothing,\" I say. \"What's your name anyway?\"</p><p>He smiles at me mischievously and yells, \u201cDarth Vader!\u201d He\u2019s laughing as he runs in the opposite direction of the car.</p><p>Darth Vader? I realize the significance of his response. He's making a crack at the house shoes I had on this morning. Not a big deal. The big deal is that Will must have been talking about me to him. I can't help but try to imagine the conversation between them, and what Will thinks about me. If he even thinks about me. For some reason, I've been thinking about him more than I'm comfortable with. I keep wondering how old he is, what his major is, if he's single.</p><p>Luckily, I didn't leave any boyfriends behind in Texas. I haven't dated anyone in almost a year. Between High School, my part time job, and helping out with Kel's sports, I hadn't had much time for boys. I realize it's going to be an adjustment, going from a person with absolutely no free time to a person with absolutely nothing to do.</p><p>I reach into the glove box to retrieve my GPS.</p><p>\"That's not a good idea,\" Will says.</p> <p>I look up to see him walking toward the car. I make my best attempt to stifle the smile that is involuntarily trying to take over my face. \"What's not a good idea?\" I ask as I insert the GPS into its holder and power it on.</p><p>He crosses his arms as he leans in the window of the car.</p><p>\"There's quite a bit of construction going on right now. That thing will get you lost.\"</p><p>I'm about to respond when Brenda pulls up along side me with my mother. Brenda rolls down her driver window and my mother leans across the seat.</p><p>\"Don't forget laundry detergent, I can't remember if I put it on the list. And cough syrup. I think I'm coming down with something,\" she says through the window.</p><p>Kel jumps out of the backseat, runs to Will's brother and invites him inside to look at our house.</p><p>\"Can I?\" Will's brother asks him.</p><p>\"Sure,\" Will says as he opens my passenger door. \"I'll be back in a little while, Caulder. I'm riding with Layken to the store.\"</p><p>He is? I shoot a look in his direction as he's buckling his seat belt.</p><p>\"I don't give very good verbal directions. Mind if I go with you?\"</p><p>\"I guess not,\" I laugh.</p><p>I look back toward Brenda and my mother but they have already pulled forward into the driveway. I put the car in drive and listen as Will gives me directions out of the neighborhood.</p><p>\"So, Caulder is your little brother's name?\" I ask, making a half-hearted attempt at small talk.</p><p>\"One and only. My parents tried for years to have another baby after me. They eventually had Caulder when names like 'Will' weren't that cool anymore.\"</p><p>\"I like your name,\" I say. I immediately regret saying it as soon as it comes out of my mouth. It sounds like a lame attempt at flirting.</p><p>He laughs. I like his laugh. I hate that I like his laugh.</p><p>It startles me when I feel him brush the hair off my shoulder and touch my neck. His fingers slip under the collar of my shirt and he pulls it slightly down over my shoulder. \u201cYou're going to need a new bandage soon.\" He pulls my shirt back up and gives it a pat. His fingers leave a streak of heat across my neck.</p><p>\"Remind me to grab some at the store,\" I say, trying to prove that his actions and his presence have no effect on me whatsoever.</p><p>\"So, Layken.\" He pauses as he glances past me at the boxes still piled high in the back seat. \"Tell me about yourself.\"</p><p>\"Um, no. That's so clich\u00e9,\" I say.</p><p>\"Fine,\" he laughs. \"I'll figure you out myself.\" He leans forward and hits eject on my c.d. player. His movements are so fluid, like he\u2019s been rehearsing them for years. I envy this about him. I\u2019ve never been known for my grace.</p><p>\"You know, you can tell a lot about a person by their taste in music.\" He pulls the c.d. out and examines the label.</p><p>\"Layken's shit?\" he laughs aloud. \"Is 'shit' descriptive here, or possessive?\"</p><p>\"I don't like Kel touching my shit, okay?\" I grab the c.d. out of his hands and insert it back into the player.</p><p>When the banjo pours out of the speakers at full volume, I'm immediately embarrassed. I'm from Texas, but I don't want him confusing this for country music. If there's one thing I don't miss about Texas, it's the country music. I reach over and turn down the volume when he grabs my hand in objection.</p><p>\"Turn it back up, I know this,\" he says as his hand remains clasped on top of mine.</p><p>My fingers are still on the volume so I turn it back up. There's no way he knows this. I realize he's bluffing; his own lame attempt at flirting.</p><p>\"Oh yeah?\" I say. I'll call his bluff. \"What's it called?\"</p><p>\"It's The Avett Brothers,\" he says. \"I call it 'Gabriella,\u2019 but I think it's the end to one of their 'Pretty Girl' songs. I love the end of this one when they break out with the electric guitars.\"</p><p>His response to my question startles me. He really does know this. \"You like The Avett Brothers?\"</p><p>\"I love them. They played in Detroit last year. Best live show I've ever seen,\" he says.</p><p>A rush of adrenaline shoots through my body as I look down at his hand, still holding onto mine, still holding onto the volume button. I like it, but I'm mad at myself for liking it. Boys have given me the butterflies before, but I usually have more control over my susceptibility to such mundane movements.</p><p>He notices me noticing our hands and he lets go, rubbing his palms on his pant leg. It seems like a nervous gesture, and I'm curious if he shares my uneasiness.</p><p>I tend to listen to music that isn\u2019t typically mainstream. It\u2019s rare when I meet someone that has even heard of half the bands I love. The Avett Brothers are my all time favorite, though.</p><p>My father and I would stay up at night and sing some of the songs together as he attempted to work the chords out on his guitar. He described them to me once. He said, \"Lake, you know a band has true talent when their imperfections define perfection.\"</p><p>I eventually understood what he meant when I started really listening to them. Broken banjo strings, momentary passionate lapses of harmony, voices that go from smooth to gravelling to all out screaming in a single verse. All these things add substance, character and believability to their music.</p><p>After my father died, my mother gave me an early present he had intended to give me for my eighteenth birthday\u2014a pair of Avett Brothers concert tickets. I cried when she gave them to me, thinking about how much my father was probably looking forward to giving me the gift himself. I knew he would have wanted me to use them, but I couldn\u2019t. The concert was just weeks after his death and I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy it. Not like I would have if he were with me.</p><p>\"I love them too,\u201d I say unsteadily.</p><p>\"Have you ever seen them play live?\" Will asks.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure why, but as we talk, I tell him the entire story about my dad. He listens intently, interrupting only to instruct me when and where to turn. I tell him all about our passion for music. I tell him about how my father died suddenly and extremely unexpectedly of a heart attack. I tell him about my eighteenth birthday and the concert we never made it to. I don't know why I keep talking, but I can't seem to shut myself up. I never divulge information so freely, especially to people I barely know. Especially to guys I barely know. I'm still talking when I realize we\u2019ve come to a stop in a grocery store parking lot.</p><p>\"Wow,\" I say as I take in the time on the clock. \"Is that the quickest way to the store? That drive took twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>He winks at me as he opens his door. \"No, actually it's not.\"</p><p>That's definitely flirting. And I definitely have butterflies.</p><p>The snow flurries start to mix with sleet as we're making our way through the parking lot. \u201cRun,\u201d he says. He takes my hand in his and pulls me faster toward the entrance.</p><p>We\u2019re out of breath and laughing when we make it inside the store, shaking the wetness from our clothes. I take my jacket off and shake it out when his hand brushes against my face, wiping a strand of wet hair away that's stuck to my cheek. His hand is cold but the moment his fingers graze my skin, I forget about the frigid temperatures when my face grows warm. His smile fades as we both stare at each other. I\u2019m still trying to become accustomed to the reactions I have around him. The slightest touch and simplest gestures have such an illicit effect on my senses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I clear my throat and break our stare as I grab an available cart next to us and hand him the grocery list.</p><p>\u201cDoes it always snow in September?\u201d I ask in an attempt to appear unfazed by his touch.</p><p>He lays his jacket across the side of the shopping cart. \u201cNo, it won\u2019t last more than a few days, maybe a week. Most of the time the snow doesn\u2019t start until late October,\" he says. \"You\u2019re lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky?\"</p> <p>\"Yeah. It\u2019s a pretty rare cold front. You got here right in time.\"</p><p>\"Huh. I assumed most of y\u2019all would hate the snow. Doesn\u2019t it snow here most of the year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY\u2019all?\u201d he laughs.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\" he says with a smile on his face. \"I\u2019ve just never heard anyone say \u2018y\u2019all\u2019 in real life before. It\u2019s cute. So southern belle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry,\" I laugh. \"From now on I\u2019ll do like you Yankees and waste my breath by saying 'all you guys.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He laughs and nudges my shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t. I like your accent, it\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve actually turned into a girl who swoons over a guy. I detest it so much; I start to inspect his features more intently, trying to find a flaw. I can\u2019t. Everything about him so far is perfect.</p><p>We get most of the items on our list and head to the checkout. He refuses to let me put anything on the conveyor belt, so I just stand back and watch as he unloads the items from the buggy. The last item he places on the line is a box of bandages. I never even saw him grab them.</p><p>When we pull out of the grocery store, Will tells me to turn in the opposite direction in which we came. We drive maybe two whole blocks when he instructs me to turn left-onto our street. The drive that took us twenty minutes on the way there takes us less than a minute on the way back.</p><p>\"Nice,\" I laugh as I pull in my driveway. I realize what he's done and that the flirtation on his end is blatantly obvious.</p> <p>I park the car, remove the keys from the ignition and grab my purse. Will has already rounded to the back of the jeep so I press the trunk lever for him. I get out and walk to where he is, expecting him to have an armload of groceries. Instead, he's just standing there holding the trunk up, watching me.</p><p>With my best southern belle impression, I place my hand across my chest and say, \"Why! I never would have been able to find the store without your help. Thank you so much for your hospitality kind sir.\"</p><p>I sort of expect him to laugh, but he just stands there, staring at me.</p><p>\"What?\" I ask nervously.</p><p>He takes a step toward me and softly cups my chin with his free hand. I'm shocked by my own reaction; the fact that I allow it. He studies my face for a few seconds as my heart races within my chest. I think he's about to kiss me.</p><p>I attempt to calm my breathing as I stare up at him. He steps in even closer and removes his hand from my chin and places it on the back of my neck, leaning my head in toward him. His lips press gently against my forehead, lingering a few seconds before he releases his hand and steps back.</p><p>\"You're so cute,\" he says as he reaches in the trunk and grabs four sacks with one hefty swoop. He walks toward the house and sets them at the entryway outside the door.</p><p>I'm frozen, attempting to absorb the last fifteen seconds of my life. Where did that come from? Why did I just stand there and let him do that? Despite my objections I realize, almost pathetically, that I have just experienced the most passionate kiss I've ever received from a guy, and it was on the freaking forehead!</p> <p>As Will is reaching into the trunk for another handful of groceries, Kel and Caulder run out of the house, followed by my mother.</p><p>The boys dart across the street to check out Caulder\u2019s bedroom. Will politely extends his hand out to my mother as she walks toward us.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Layken and Kel\u2019s mom. I\u2019m Will Cooper. We live across the street.\u201d</p><p>\"Julia Cohen,\" she says. \"You're Caulder's older brother?\"</p><p>\"Yes, Ma\u2019am,\" he replies. \"Older by twelve years.\"</p><p>\"So that makes you...twenty-one?\" She turns toward me and winks.</p><p>Oh no, she's trying to embarrass me. I'm standing behind Will at this point, so I take the opportunity to reciprocate one of her infamous glares. She just smiles.</p><p>\u201cWell, I'm glad Kel and Lake were able to make friends so fast,\u201d she says.</p><p>\"Me too,\" he replies.</p><p>She turns and heads inside but purposefully nudges me with her shoulder as she passes. She doesn't speak a word but I know what she's hinting at; she's giving me her approval.</p><p>Will reaches in for the last two sacks. \"Lake, huh? I like that.\" He hands me the sacks as he shuts the trunk.</p><p>\"So, Lake.\" He leans back against the car and crosses his arms. \"Caulder and I are going to Detroit on Friday. We\u2019ll be gone until late Sunday, family stuff,\" he says with a dismissing wave of his hand. \"I was wondering if you had any plans for tomorrow night, before I go?\"</p><p>It's the first time anyone has ever referred to me as \"Lake,\" other than my mom and dad. I like it. I lean my shoulder against the car too, and face him. I try to keep my cool, but inside I'm screaming with excitement.</p><p>\"Are you really going to make me admit that I have absolutely no life here?\" I say.</p><p>\"Great! It's a date then. I'll pick you up at seven-thirty.\" He immediately turns and heads toward his house when I realize he never actually asked, and I never actually agreed.</p><p>2.</p><p>\"It won't take long for me</p><p>To tell you who I am.</p><p>Well you hear this voice right now</p><p>Well that's pretty much all I am.\"</p><p>-The Avett Brothers, Gimmeakiss</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The next afternoon, I'm picking out what to wear but can't seem to locate any clean, weather appropriate clothing. I don't own many winter shirts, besides what I've already worn this week. I choose a purple long sleeved shirt and smell it, deciding it's clean enough. I spray some perfume though, just in case it isn't. I brush my teeth, touch up my makeup, brush my teeth again and let down my ponytail. I curl a few sections of my hair and pull some silver earrings out of my drawer when I hear a knock on the bathroom door.</p><p>My mother enters with a handful of towels. She opens the cabinet next to the shower and places them inside.</p><p>\"Going somewhere?\" she asks. She sits down on the edge of the bathtub while I continue to get ready.</p><p>\"Yes, somewhere.\" I try to hide my smile as I put in my earrings. \"Honestly, I'm not sure what we're doing. I really never even agreed to the date.\"</p><p>She stands up and walks to the door, leaning up against the frame as she watches me in the mirror. She has aged so much in the short time since my dad's death. Her bright green eyes against her smooth porcelain skin used to be breathtaking. Now, her cheekbones stand out above the hallowed shadows in her cheeks. The dark circles under her eyes overpower their emerald hue. She looks tired. And sad.</p><p>\"Well, you're eighteen now. You've had enough of my dating advice for a lifetime,\" she says. \"But I'll provide you with a quick recap just in case. Don't order anything with onion or garlic, never leave your drink unattended and always use protection.\"</p><p>\"Ugh, Mom!\" I roll my eyes. \"You know I know the rules, and you know I don't have to worry about the last one. Please don't give Will a recap of your rules. Promise?\" I make her promise.</p><p>\"So tell me about Will. Does he work? Is he in college? What's his major? Is he a serial killer?\" She says this with such sincerity.</p><p>I walk the short distance to my bedroom from the bathroom and bend down to search through my shoes. She follows me and sits on the bed.</p><p>\"Honestly Mom, I don't know anything about him. I didn't even know how old he was until he told you.\"</p><p>\"That's good,\" she says.</p><p>\"Good?\" I glance back at her. \"How is not knowing anything about him good? I'm about to be alone with him for hours. He could be a serial killer.\" I grab my boots and walk over to the bed to slip them on.</p><p>\"It\u2019ll give you plenty to talk about. That's what first dates are for.\"</p><p>\"Good point,\" I say.</p><p>Growing up, my mother did give great advice. She always knew what I wanted to hear, but would tell me what I needed to hear. My dad was her first boyfriend so I have always been curious how she seems to know so much about dating, boys, and relationships. She's only been with one person, and it seems most knowledge would have to come from life experiences. She's the exception, I guess.</p><p>\"Mom?\" I say as I slip on my boots. \"I know you were only eighteen when you met dad. I mean, that's really young to meet the person you spend the rest of your life with. Do you ever regret it?\"</p><p>She doesn't answer immediately. Instead, she lies back on my bed and clasps her hands behind her head as she ponders my question.</p><p>\"I've never regretted it. Questioned it? Sure. But never regretted.\"</p><p>\"Is there a difference?\" I ask.</p><p>\"Absolutely. Regret is counterproductive. It's looking back on a past that you can't change. Questioning things as they occur can prevent regret in the future. I questioned a lot about my relationship with your father. People make spontaneous decisions based off of their hearts all the time. There's so much more to relationships than just love.\"</p><p>\"Is that why you always tell me to follow my head, not my heart?\u201d</p><p>My mother sits up on the bed and takes my hands in hers as she speaks. \"Lake, do you want some real advice that doesn't include a list of foods you should avoid?\"</p><p>Has she been holding out on me? \"Of course,\" I reply.</p><p>She's lost the authoritative, parented edge to her voice, which makes me aware that this conversation is less from a mother-daughter standpoint and more woman to woman. She pulls her legs up Indian style on the bed and faces me.</p><p>\"There are three questions every woman should be able to answer yes to before they commit to a man. If you answer no to any of the three questions, run like hell.\"</p><p>\"It's just a date,\" I laugh. \"I doubt we'll be doing any committing.\"</p><p>\"I know you're not, Lake. I'm serious. If you can't answer yes to these three questions, don't even waste your time on a relationship.\"</p><p>When I open my mouth, I feel like I'm just reinforcing the fact that I'm her child. I don't interrupt her again.</p><p>\"Does he treat you with respect at all times? That\u2019s the first question. The second question is, if he is the exact same person twenty years from now that he is today, would you still want to marry him? And finally, does he inspire you to want to be a better person? You find someone you can answer yes to all three, then you\u2019ve found a good man.\"</p><p>\"Wow, those are some intense questions.\" I take a deep breath as I soak in even more sage advice from her. \"Were you able to answer yes to all of them? When you were with Dad?\"</p><p>\"Absolutely.\" She doesn't hesitate. \"Every second I was with him.\"</p><p>I watch the sadness enter her eyes as she finishes her sentence. She loved my dad. I start to regret bringing it up. I put my arms around her and embrace her. It's been so long since I've hugged her, a twinge of guilt rises up inside me. She kisses my hair, then pulls away and smiles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stand up and run my hands down my shirt, smoothing out the folds.</p><p>\"Well? How do I look?\" I ask.</p><p>\"Like a woman,\u201d she sighs.</p><p>It's seven-thirty sharp so I go to the living room, grab the jacket Will insisted I borrow the day before and head to the window. He's coming out of his house so I walk outside and stand in my driveway. He looks up and notices me as he's opening his car door.</p> <p>\"You ready?\" he yells.</p><p>\"Yes!\"</p><p>\"Well, come on then!\"</p><p>I don't move. I just stand there and fold my arms across my chest.</p><p>\"What are you doing?\" He throws his hand up in defeat and laughs.</p> <p>\"You said you would pick me up at seven-thirty! I'm waiting for you to pick me up!\"</p><p>He grins as he gets in the car. He backs straight out of his driveway and into mine so that the passenger door is closest to me. He hops out of the car and runs around to open it. Before I get in I give him the onceover. He\u2019s wearing loose fitted jeans and a black long sleeved shirt that outlines his arms. It's the defined arms that prompt me to return his jacket to him.</p><p>\u201cThat reminds me,\u201d I say as I hand him his jacket. \u201cI bought this for you.\u201d</p><p>He grabs the jacket and slides his arms inside. \u201cWow, it even smells like me,\u201d he laughs.</p><p>He waits until I've buckled up before he shuts the door. As he's walking around to his side, I notice the car smells like...cheese. Not old, stale cheese; but fresh cheese, cheddar maybe. My stomach growls. I'm curious where we're going to eat.</p><p>When Will gets in, he reaches into the backseat and grabs a sack. \"We don't have time to eat, so I made us grilled cheese.\" He hands me a sandwich and a bottle of soda.</p> <p>\"Wow. This is a first,\" I say as I stare at the items in my hands. \"And where exactly are we going in such a hurry?\u201d I twist open my lid. \"It's obviously not a restaurant.\"</p><p>He unwraps his sandwich and takes a bite. \"It's a surprise,\" he says with a mouthful of bread. He navigates the steering wheel with his free hand as he simultaneously drives and eats. \"I know a lot more about you than you know about me, so tonight I want to show you what I'm all about.\"</p><p>\"Well, I'm intrigued,\" I say. I really am intrigued.</p><p>We both finish our sandwiches and I put the trash back in the bag and place it in the backseat. I try to think of something to say to break the silence, so I ask him about his family.</p><p>\"What are your parents like?\"</p><p>He takes a deep breath and slowly exhales. \"I'm not big on small talk, Lake. We can figure all that out later. Let's make this drive interesting,\" he says as he relaxes further into his seat.</p><p>Driving, no talking, keeping it interesting. I'm repeating what he said in my head and hope I\u2019m misunderstanding his intent. He laughs when he sees the hesitation on my face and it dawns on him that I've taken what he said out of context.</p><p>\"Lake, No!\" he laughs. \"I just meant let\u2019s talk about something besides what we\u2019re expected to talk about.\"</p> <p>I breathe a sigh of relief. I thought I had found his flaw. \"Good,\" I laugh.</p><p>\"I know a game we can play. It's called 'would you rather.' Have you played it before?\"</p><p>I shake my head. \"No, but I know I would rather you go first.\"</p><p>\"Okay.\" He clears his throat and pauses for a few seconds. \"Okay, would you rather spend the rest of your life with no arms; or would you rather spend the rest of your life with arms you couldn't control?\"</p><p>What the hell? I can honestly say this date has definitely not started the way any of my previous dates have gone. It's pleasantly unexpected though.</p><p>\"Well...\" I hesitate. \"I guess I would rather spend the rest of my life with arms I couldn't control?\"</p><p>\"What? Seriously? But you wouldn't be controlling them!\" he says, flapping his arms around in the car. \"They could be flailing around and you'd be constantly punching yourself in the face! Or worse, you might grab a knife and stab yourself!\"</p><p>\"I didn't realize there were right and wrong answers,\" I say.</p><p>\"You suck at this!\" he teases. \"Your turn.\"</p><p>\"Okay, let me think.\"</p><p>\"You have to have one ready!\" he says.</p><p>\"Jeez, Will! I barely heard of this game for the first time thirty seconds ago. Give me a second to think of one.\"</p><p>He reaches over and squeezes my hand. \"I'm teasing.\"</p><p>He repositions his hand underneath mine and our fingers interlock. I like how easy the transition is, like we've been holding hands for years. So far, everything about this date has been easy. I like Will's sense of humor. I like that I find it so easy to laugh around him after having gone so many months without laughing. I like that we're holding hands. I really like that we're holding hands.</p><p>\"Okay, I've got one,\" I say. \"Would you rather pee on yourself once a day at random, unknown times? Or would you rather have to pee on someone else?\"</p><p>\"It depends on who I'd have to pee on. Can I pee on people I don\u2019t like? Or is it random people?\"</p><p>\"Random people.\"</p><p>\"Pee on myself,\" he says without hesitation. \"My turn now. Would you rather be four feet tall, or seven feet tall?\"</p><p>\"Seven feet tall,\" I reply.</p><p>\"Why?\"</p><p>\"You aren't allowed to ask why,\" I say. \"Okay, let\u2019s see. Would you rather drink an entire gallon of bacon grease for breakfast every day? Or would you rather have to eat five pounds of popcorn for supper every night?\"</p><p>\"Five pounds of popcorn.\"</p><p>I like the game we\u2019re playing. I like that he didn\u2019t worry about impressing me with dinner. I like that I have no idea where we're headed. I even like that he didn\u2019t compliment what I was wearing, which seems to be the standard opening line for dates. So far, I like everything about tonight. As far as I\u2019m concerned, we could drive around for another two hours just playing \u2018would you rather\u2019-and it would be the most fun I\u2019ve ever had on a date.</p><p>But, we don\u2019t. We eventually reach our destination and I immediately tense up when I see the sign on the building.</p><p>Club N9NE</p><p>\"Uh, Will? I don't dance.\" I'm hoping he'll be empathetic.</p><p>\"Uh, neither do I.\"</p><p>We exit the vehicle and meet at the front of the car. I'm not sure who reached out first, but once again our fingers find each other in the dark and he holds my hand as he guides me toward the entrance. As we get closer to the entrance, I notice a sign posted on the door.</p><p>Closed for Slam</p><p>Thursdays</p><p>8:00-Whenever</p><p>Admission: Free</p><p>Fee to slam: $3</p><p>Will opens the door without reading the sign. I start to inform him the club is closed but he seems like he knows what he's doing. The silence is interrupted by the energy of the crowd as I follow him through the entryway and into the room. There is an empty stage to the right of us, with tables and chairs set up all over the dance floor. The place is packed. I see a table toward the front that looks like a group of younger kids, around age fourteen or so. Will turns to the left and heads to an empty booth in the back of the room.</p><p>\"It's quieter back here,\" he says.</p><p>\"How old do you have to be to get into clubs here?\" I ask, still observing the group of out of place children.</p><p>\"Well, tonight it's not a club,\" he says as we scoot into the booth.</p><p>It's a half circle booth facing the stage so I scoot all the way to the middle to get the best view. He moves in right beside me.</p><p>\"It's slam night,\" he says. \"Every Thursday they shut the club down and people come here to compete in the slam.\"</p><p>\"And what's a slam?\" I ask.</p><p>\u201cIt's poetry,\" he says as he smiles at me. \"It's what I'm all about.\"</p><p>Is he for real? A hot guy who makes me laugh and loves poetry? Someone pinch me. Or not; I'd rather not wake up.</p><p>\"Poetry, huh?\" I say. \"Do people write their own or do they get it from other authors?\"</p><p>He leans back in the seat and looks up at the stage. I can see the passion in his eyes when he talks about it. \"People get up there and pour their hearts out just using their words and the movement of their bodies,\" he says. \"It's amazing. You aren't going to hear any Dickinson or Frost here.\"</p><p>\"Is it like a competition?\" I ask.</p><p>\"It's complicated,\" he says. \"It differs between every club. Normally during a slam, the judges are picked at random from the audience and they assign points to each performance. The one with the most points at the end of the night wins. That's how they do it here, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\"So do you slam?\" I ask.</p><p>\"Sometimes. Sometimes I judge, sometimes I just watch.\"</p><p>\"Are you performing tonight?\"</p><p>\"Nah. Just an observer tonight. I don't really have anything ready.\"</p><p>I'm disappointed. It would be amazing to see him perform on stage. I still have no idea what slam poetry is, but I'm really curious to see him do anything that requires a performance.</p><p>\"Bummer,\" I say.</p><p>\"You want something to drink?\" he says.</p><p>\"Sure. I'll take some chocolate milk.\"</p><p>\"Chocolate milk? Really?\"</p><p>\"With ice.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" he says as he slides out of the booth. \"One chocolate milk on the rocks coming right up.\"</p><p>While he's gone, the emcee comes to the stage and attempts to pump up the crowd. No one is in the back of the room where we're seated, so I feel a little silly when I yell 'yeah!' with the rest of the crowd. I sink further into my seat and decide just to be a spectator for the remainder of the night.</p><p>The emcee announces it\u2019s time to pick the judges and the entire crowd roars, almost everyone wanting to be chosen. They pick five people at random and move them to the judging table. As Will walks back to the booth with our drinks, the emcee announces it's time for the 'sac,' and chooses someone at random.</p><p>\"What's the sac?\" I ask as he hands me my drink.</p><p>\"Sacrifice...It's what they use to prepare the judges,\" he says as he slides back into the booth. Somehow, he slides even closer this time.</p><p>\"Someone performs something that isn't part of the competition so the judges can calibrate their scoring.\"</p><p>\"So they can call on anyone? What if they would have called on me?\" I ask, suddenly nervous.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess you should have had something ready,\u201d he says as he smiles at me.</p><p>He takes a sip from his drink then leans back against the booth, finding my hand in the dark. Our fingers don't interlock this time, though. Instead, he places my hand on his leg and his fingertips start to trace the outline of my wrist. He gently traces each of my fingers, following the lines and curves of my entire hand. His fingertips feel like electric pulses penetrating my skin.</p><p>\"Lake,\" he says quietly as he continues to trace up my wrist and back to my fingertips with a fluid motion. \"I don\u2019t know what it is about you...but I like you.\"</p><p>His fingers slide between mine as he takes my hand in his and turns his attention back to the stage. I inhale and reach for my chocolate milk with my free hand, downing the entire glass. The ice feels good against my lips. It cools me off.</p><p>They call on a young woman who looks to be around twenty-five. She announces that she is performing a piece she wrote titled 'Blue Sweater.\u2019 The lights are lowered as a spotlight is positioned on her. She raises the microphone and steps forward, staring down at the floor. A hush sweeps over the audience and the only sound in the entire room is the sound of her breath, amplified through the speakers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She raises her hand to the microphone, still staring down to the floor. She begins to tap her finger against it in a repetitive motion, resonating the sound of a heartbeat. I realize I'm holding my own breath as she begins her piece.</p><p>Bom Bom...</p><p>Bom Bom...</p><p>Bom Bom...</p> <p>Do you hear that?</p><p>(Her voice lingering on the word hear)</p><p>That's the sound of my heart beating...</p><p>(She taps the microphone again)</p><p>Bom Bom...</p> <p>Bom Bom...</p><p>Bom Bom...</p><p>Do you hear that? That's the sound of your heart beating.</p><p>(She begins to speak faster, much louder than before.)</p><p>It was the first day of October. I was wearing my blue sweater, you know the one I bought at Dillard\u2019s? The one with a double knitted hem and holes in the ends of the sleeves that I could poke my thumbs through when it was cold but I didn't feel like wearing gloves? It was the same sweater you said made my eyes look like reflections of the stars on the ocean.</p><p>You promised to love me forever that night...</p> <p>ever!</p><p>It was the first day of December this time. I was wearing my blue sweater, you know the one I bought at Dillard\u2019s? The one with a double knitted hem and holes in the ends of the sleeves that I could poke my thumbs through when it was cold but I didn't feel like wearing gloves? It was the same sweater you said made my eyes look like reflections of the stars on the ocean.</p><p>I told you I was three weeks late.</p><p>You said it was fate.</p><p>You promised to love me forever that night...</p><p>ever!</p><p>It was the first day of May. I was wearing my blue sweater, although this time the double stitched hem was worn and the strength of each thread tested as they were pulled tight against my growing belly. You know the one. The same one I bought at Dillard\u2019s? The one with holes in the ends of the sleeves that I could poke my thumbs through when it was cold but I didn't feel like wearing gloves? It was the same sweater you said made my eyes look like reflections of the stars on the ocean.</p><p>The SAME sweater you RIPPED off of my body as you shoved me to the floor,</p> <p>calling me a whore,</p><p>telling me</p><p>you didn't love me</p><p>anymore.</p><p>Bom Bom...</p><p>Bom Bom...</p><p>Bom Bom...</p><p>Do you hear that? That's the sound of my heart beating.</p><p>Bom Bom...</p><p>Bom Bom...</p><p>Bom Bom...</p><p>Do you hear that? That's the sound of your heart beating.</p><p>(There is a long silence as she clasps her hands to her stomach, tears streaming down her face)</p><p>Do you hear that? Of course you don't. That's the silence of my womb.</p><p>Because you</p><p>RIPPED</p><p>OFF</p><p>MY</p><p>SWEATER!</p><p>The lights come back up and the audience roars. I take a deep breath and wipe tears from my eyes. I am mesmerized by her ability to hypnotize an entire audience with such powerfully portrayed words. Just words. I'm immediately addicted and want to hear more. I'm still immobile when Will puts his arm around my shoulders and leans back into the seat with me, bringing me back to reality.</p><p>\"Well?\" he asks.</p><p>I accept his embrace and move my head to his shoulder as we both stare out over the crowd. He rests his chin on the top of my head.</p><p>\"That was unbelievable,\" I whisper. His hand touches the side of my head, leaning me slightly forward as his lips brush my forehead. I close my eyes and wonder how much more my emotions can be tested. Three days ago, I was devastated, bitter, hopeless. Today I woke up feeling happy for the first time in months. I feel vulnerable. I try to mask my emotions but I feel like everyone knows what I'm thinking and feeling and I don't like it. I don't like being an open book. I feel like I'm up on the stage, pouring my heart out to him, and it scares the hell out of me.</p><p>We sit there in the same embrace as several more people perform their pieces. The poetry is as vast and electrifying as the audience. I have never laughed and cried so much. The way these poets were able to lure you into a whole new world, viewing things from a vantage point you have never seen before. Making you feel like you are the mother who lost her baby, or the boy who killed his father, or even the man who got high for the first time and ate five plates of bacon. I feel a connection with these poets and their stories. More so, I feel a deeper connection to Will. I can't imagine that he's brave enough to get up on the stage and bare his soul like these people are doing. I have to see it. I have to see him do this.</p><p>The emcee makes one last appeal for performers.</p><p>\"Will, you can't bring me here and not perform. Please do one? Please, please, please?\"</p><p>He leans his head back against the booth. \"You\u2019re killing me, Lake. Like I said, I don't really have anything new.\u201d</p><p>\"Do something old then,\" I suggest. \"Or do all these people make you nervous?\"</p><p>He tilts his head toward me and smiles. \"Not all of them. Just one of them.\"</p><p>I suddenly have the urge to kiss him. I suppress the urge, for now, as I continue to plead. I clasp my hands together under my chin.</p><p>\"Don't make me beg,\" I say.</p><p>\"You already are!\" he laughs. \"Alright, alright. But I'm warning you, you asked.\"</p><p>He pulls his wallet out of his pocket just as the emcee is announcing the start of round two. He stands up, holding his three dollars in the air. \"I'm in!\"</p><p>The emcee shields his eyes with his hand, squinting into the audience to see who spoke up. \"Ladies and Gentlemen it's one of our very own, Mr. Will Cooper! So nice of you to finally join us,\" he teases into the microphone.</p><p>Will makes his way through the crowd and walks onto the stage and into the spotlight.</p><p>\"What's the name of your piece tonight Will?\" the emcee asks.</p><p>\"Death,\" Will replies, looking past the crowd and directly at me. The smile fades from his eyes as he begins his performance.</p><p>Death. The only thing inevitable in life.</p><p>People don\u2019t like to talk about death because</p><p>it makes them sad.</p><p>They don\u2019t want to imagine how life will go on without them,</p><p>all the people they love will briefly grieve</p><p>but continue to breathe.</p><p>They don\u2019t want to imagine how life will go on without them,</p><p>Their children will still grow</p><p>Get married</p><p>Get old...</p><p>They don\u2019t want to imagine how life will continue to go on without them,</p><p>Their material things will be sold</p><p>Their medical files stamped \u2018closed\u2019</p><p>Their name becoming a memory to everyone they know.</p><p>They don\u2019t want to imagine how life will go on without them, so instead of accepting it head on, they avoid the subject altogether,</p><p>hoping and praying it will somehow</p><p>pass them by.</p><p>Forget about them,</p><p>moving on to the next one in line.</p><p>No, they didn\u2019t want to imagine how life would continue to go on...</p><p>without them.</p><p>But death</p><p>didn\u2019t</p><p>forget.</p><p>Instead they were met head-on by death,</p><p>disguised as an eighteen-wheeler</p><p>behind a cloud of fog.</p><p>No.</p><p>Death didn\u2019t forget about them.</p><p>If they only would have been prepared, accepted the inevitable, laid out their plans, understood that it wasn\u2019t just their lives at hand.</p><p>I may have legally been considered an adult at the age of nineteen, but I still felt very much</p><p>of just nineteen.</p><p>Unprepared</p><p>and overwhelmed</p><p>to suddenly have the entire life of a seven-year-old</p><p>In my realm.</p><p>Death. The only thing inevitable in life.</p><p>Will steps out of the spotlight and off of the stage before he even sees his scores. I find myself hoping he gets lost on his way back to our booth so that I have time to absorb this. I have no idea how to react. I had no idea that this was his life. That Caulder was his whole life. I\u2019m amazed by his performance but devastated by his words. I wipe tears away with the back of my hand. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m crying for the loss of Will\u2019s parents, the responsibilities of that loss or the simple fact that he spoke the truth. He spoke about a side of death and loss that never seems to be considered until it\u2019s too late. A side that I'm unfortunately all too familiar with. The Will I watched walk up to the stage is not the same Will I\u2019m watching walk toward me. I'm conflicted, I'm confused, and most of all I'm taken aback. He was beautiful.</p><p>He notices as I'm wiping tears from my eyes. \u201cI warned you,\u201d he smiles as he slides back into the booth.</p><p>He reaches for his drink and takes a sip, stirring the ice cubes with his straw. I have no idea what to say to him. He completely put it all out there, right in front of me.</p><p>My emotions take control over my actions. I reach forward and take his hand in mine and he sets his drink back down on the table. He looks at me and smiles as he reaches to my face and traces the side of my cheek. I don\u2019t understand the connection I feel with him. It all seems so fast. I turn his hand over and gently kiss the inside of his palm as we hold each other\u2019s stare. We suddenly become the only two people in the entire room; all the external noise fades into the distance.</p><p>He takes my face in his hands and I close my eyes. I feel his breath draw closer as he pulls my face toward his. When he touches his lips to mine, he hesitates. He slowly kisses my bottom lip, then my top lip. His lips are warm, still wet from his drink. I try to kiss him back, but he pulls away when my mouth responds. I open my eyes and he is smiling at me, still holding my face in his hands.</p><p>\"Patience,\" he whispers. He leans in and kisses me on the cheek. He moves his mouth to my other cheek and kisses me again. I close my eyes and inhale as I try to calm the overwhelming impulse I have to wrap my arms around him and kiss him back. I don't know how he has so much self-control. He presses his forehead against mine and slides his hands down to my arms. Our eyes lock as we open them. It's during this moment that I finally understand why my mother accepted her fate at the age of eighteen.</p><p>\"Wow,\u201d I exhale.</p><p>\"Yeah,\u201d he agrees. \"Wow.\"</p><p>We hold each other\u2019s gaze for a few more seconds when the audience starts to roar again. They are announcing the qualifiers for round two when Will grabs my hand and whispers, \"Let's go.\"</p><p>As I make my way out of the booth, my entire body feels like it's about to give out on me. I've never experienced anything like what just happened. Ever.</p><p>We exit the booth and our hands remain locked as he navigates me through the ever growing crowd and into the parking lot. I didn't realize how warm I was until the cold Michigan air touches my skin. It feels exhilarating. Or I feel exhilarated. I can't tell which. All I know is that I wish the last two hours of my life could repeat for eternity.</p><p>\"You don't want to stay?\" I ask him.</p><p>\"Lake, you've been moving and unpacking for days. You need sleep.\"</p><p>\"Sleep does sound good,\" I say as I yawn.</p><p>He opens my door but before I get in, he wraps his arms around my waist and pulls me to him in a tight embrace. He runs his hand through my hair as I take in his scent. I try to pull him closer, but we can't seem to get close enough. Several minutes pass as we just stand there, holding on to the moment. I've always been so guarded. This new side of me that Will brings out is a side of me I didn't know I had.</p><p>We eventually break apart and get in the car. As we drive away from the parking lot I lean my head against the window and watch the club as it minimizes in the rearview mirror. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Will?\" I whisper without breaking my gaze as the building disappears behind us. \"Thank you for this.\"</p><p>He takes my hand into his and I fall asleep, smiling.</p><p>I wake up as he's opening my door and we're in my driveway. He reaches in and grabs my hand as I step out of the car. I can't remember the last time I fell asleep in a moving vehicle. Will was right, I am tired. I rub my eyes and yawn again as he walks me to the front door. He wraps his arms around my waist as I raise mine around his shoulders and we embrace again. He squeezes my waist tighter and moves me closer into him. Our bodies are a perfect fit.</p><p>\"Lake, I already miss you,\" he whispers in my ear. A chill runs down my body as his breath warms my neck. I can't believe we only met three days ago; it seems like we've been doing this for years.</p> <p>\"Just think,\" I say. \"You'll be gone three whole days. That's the same length of time that I've known you.\"</p><p>I didn't think it was possible, but he pulls me even closer. \"This will be the longest three days of my life,\" he says.</p><p>If I know my mother at all, then we've got an audience, so I'm relieved his final kiss is nothing more than a quick peck on the cheek. He slowly walks backwards toward his car, his fingers sliding out of mine, eventually letting go. My arm falls limp to my side as I watch him get into his car. He cranks the engine and rolls down his window. \"Lake, I've got a pretty long drive home,\" he teases. \"How about one for the road?\"</p><p>I walk to the car and lean through his window, expecting another peck. Instead, he slips his hand behind my neck and gently presses me toward him, our lips separating as they meet. Neither of us holds back this time. I reach through the window and run my fingers through the back of his hair as we continue kissing. It takes all I have not to swing open the car door and crawl into his lap. The door between us feels more like a barricade.</p><p>We finally come to a stop; our lips are still touching as we both hesitate to part. Our breath rises in small waves of fog as it meets the cold air.</p> <p>\"Damn,\" he whispers. \"It gets better every time.\"</p><p>I plant a small peck on his mouth. He does the same. We continue back and forth until I start to laugh. \"I'll see you in three days,\" I smile. \"You be careful driving home tonight.\" I give him one final kiss as I pull away from the window.</p><p>He backs out of the driveway and again straight into his own. I'm tempted to run after him and kiss him again to prove his theory. Instead, I avoid temptation and turn to head inside.</p><p>\"Lake!\"</p><p>I turn around just as he shuts his car door and jogs across the street toward me. Did I leave something in his car? I wait for him to say something else to explain what he's doing, but instead he just smiles as he gets closer.</p><p>\"I forgot to tell you something,\" he says as he wraps his arms around me again. \"You look beautiful tonight.\" He kisses me on top of my head, releases his hold and turns back toward his house.</p> <p>Maybe I was wrong earlier-about me liking the fact that he didn't compliment me tonight. I was definitely wrong. When he gets to his front door, he turns around and smiles before he goes inside.</p><p>Just like I had imagined, my mother is sitting on the sofa with a book, attempting to appear uninterested as I walk through the front door. \"Well, how'd it go? Is he a serial killer?\" she asks.</p><p>My smile is uncontrollable now. I walk to the sofa opposite her and throw myself on it like a ragdoll and sigh. \"You were right Mom, I love Michigan.\"</p><p>3.</p><p>\"But I can tell by watching you</p><p>That there's no chance of pushing through</p><p>The odds are so against us</p><p>You know most young love, it ends like this.\"</p> <p>-The Avett Brothers, I Would Be Sad</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>I'm more nervous than I had anticipated when I wake up Monday morning. My mind has been so preoccupied with all things Will, I haven't had time to process my impending doom. Or rather, my first day ever at a brand new school.</p><p>Mom and I finally had a chance to go shopping for weather appropriate clothing over the weekend. I throw on what I picked out the evening before and slide on my new snow boots. I leave my hair down for the day but slide an extra band onto my wrist for when I want to pull it back, which I know I\u2019ll do.</p><p>After I finish up in the bathroom I move to the kitchen and grab my backpack and my class schedule off of the counter. Mom began her new night shift at the hospital last night, so I agree to take Kel to school.</p><p>Back in Texas, Kel and I went to the same school. In fact, everyone in the vicinity of our town went to the same school. Here, there are so many schools I have to print out a district map just to be sure I'm taking him to the right place.</p><p>When we pull up to the elementary, Kel immediately spots Caulder and jumps out of the car without even saying goodbye. He makes life look so easy.</p><p>Luckily, the Elementary is only a few blocks from the High School. I\u2019ll have extra time to spare so that I can locate my first class. I pull into the parking lot of what I consider to be a massive High School and search for a spot. When I find one available, it's as far from the building as it could be and there are dozens of students standing around their vehicles chatting. I am hesitant to get out of my car, but realize when I do that no one even notices me. It's not like in the movies when the new girl steps out of her car onto the lawn of the new school, clutching her books, everyone stopping what they're doing to stare. It's not like that at all. I feel invisible and I like it.</p><p>I make it through first period math without being assigned homework, which is good. I plan on spending the entire evening with Will. When I woke up this morning, there was a note on my jeep from him. All it said was, \"Can't wait to see you. I'll be back by four. I've missed you so bad.\"</p><p>Seven hours and three minutes to go.</p><p>History isn't any harder. The teacher is giving notes on the Punic Wars, something we had just covered in my previous school. I find it hard to focus as I literally count down the minutes. The teacher is very monotonous and mundane. If I don't find something to be interesting, my mind has a tendency to wander. It keeps wandering to Will. I am methodically taking notes, trying my best to focus when someone behind me pokes my back.</p><p>\"Hey, let me see your schedule,\u201d the girl directs.</p><p>I inconspicuously reach for my schedule and fold it up tightly in my left hand. I raise my hand behind me and quickly drop the schedule on her desk.</p><p>\"Oh please!\" she says louder. \"Mr. Hanushek is half blind and can barely hear. Don't worry about him.\"</p><p>I stifle a laugh and turn toward her as Mr. Hanushek is facing the board. \"I'm Layken,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\"Eddie,\" she responds.</p><p>I look at her questioningly and she rolls her eyes.</p><p>\"I know,\" she whispers. \"It's a family name. But if you call me Eddie Spaghetti I'll kick your ass!\" she threatens mildly.</p><p>\"I'll keep that in mind,\" I laugh.</p><p>\"Cool, we have the same third period,\" she says as she inspects my schedule. \"It's a bitch to find. Stick with me after class and I'll show you where it is.\"</p><p>Eddie leans forward to write something down and her slinky blond hair swings forward with her. It falls just below her chin in an asymmetrical style. Her nails are each painted a completely different color, and she has a variety of about 15 bracelets on each of her wrists that rattle and clank every time she moves. She has a small, simple outline of a black heart tattooed on the inside of her left wrist.</p><p>When the bell rings, I stand up as Eddie passes me back the schedule. She reaches into my jacket pocket and pulls out my phone and starts punching numbers. I look at the schedule she has returned to me and it\u2019s now covered in websites and phone numbers; in green ink. Eddie sees me looking and points to the first web address on the page.</p><p>\"That's my facebook page, but if you can't find me there, I'm also on twitter. Don't ask me for my myspace username because that shit\u2019s lame,\" she says, strangely serious.</p><p>She scrolls down the remaining numbers jotted on my schedule with her finger. \"That's my cell phone number, that's my home phone number and that's the number to Getty\u2019s Pizza,\" she says.</p><p>\"Is that where you work?\"</p><p>\"No, they just have great pizza.\"</p><p>She moves past me and I start to follow her out the door as she turns and hands me back my phone.</p><p>\u201cI just called myself so I have your number now, too. Oh, and you need to go to the office before next period.\"</p><p>\"Why? I thought you wanted me to follow you?\" I ask, feeling slightly overwhelmed by my new friend.</p><p>\"They have you in 'B' lunch. I'm in 'A' lunch. Go switch yours to 'A' lunch and meet me in third period.\"</p><p>And she's gone. Just like that.</p><p>The administration office is just two doors down. The secretary, Mrs. Alex, makes rolling her eyes a new form of art as she prints my 'new' new schedule just as the second bell for third period rings.</p><p>\"Do you know where this English elective is located?\" I say before I leave.</p><p>She gives me somewhat lengthy and confusing directions, assuming that I know where 'Hall A' is, and \u2018Hall D.\u2019 I wait patiently until she's finished and walk out the door, more confused than before.</p><p>I wander across three different hallways, entering two wrong classrooms and one janitor's closet. I round the corner when I finally see 'Hall D' and feel some relief. I set my backpack down on the floor as I place the schedule between my lips and pull the rubber band off of my wrist. It's not even ten in the morning and I'm already pulling my hair up. It's that kind of day already. I gather my hair in a bunch and pull it through the rubber band twice. I pull at my hair to tighten it inside the band.</p><p>\"Layken?\"</p><p>My heart nearly jumps out of my chest when I hear his voice. I turn around and see Will standing next to me with a confused look on his face. I pull the schedule out of my mouth and smile as I instinctively wrap my arms around him. \"Will! What are you doing here?\"</p><p>He hugs me back, but only for a second before his hands wrap around my wrists, removing my arms from around his neck.</p><p>\"Lake,\" he says hesitantly. \"Where...What are you doing here?\"</p><p>I sigh as I thrust my schedule into his chest. \"I'm trying to find this stupid elective but I'm lost,\" I whine. \"Help me!\"</p><p>He takes another step back against the wall. \"Lake, no...\" he says, putting the schedule back into my hands without even looking at it.</p><p>He's horrified to see me! He turns away from me and clasps his hands behind his head.</p><p>I don't understand his reaction. I stand there, waiting for some sort of explanation when it dawns on me. He's here to see his girlfriend! The girlfriend that he failed to mention. I snatch my backpack up and immediately start to walk away when his arm reaches out and pulls me to a stop.</p><p>\"Where are you going?\" he demands.</p><p>I roll my eyes and let out a short sigh. \"I get it Will. I get it. I'll leave you alone before your girlfriend sees us.\" I'm trying to hold back tears at this point, so I step out of his grasp and turn away from him.</p><p>\"Girlfr-no. No, Lake. I don't think you do get it.\" he says.</p><p>The faint sound of footsteps slowly becomes louder as they round the corner to Hall D. I turn to see another student barreling toward us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Oh man, I thought I was late,\" the student says as he spots us in the hallway. He comes to a stop in front of the classroom.</p><p>\"You are late, Javier,\" Will replies, opening the door behind him, motioning for Javier to enter. \"Javi, I'll be there in a few minutes. Let the class know they have five minutes to review before the exam.\"</p><p>Will closes the door behind him, and we are once again alone in the hallway.</p><p>The air is all but gone from my lungs. I feel pressure building in my chest as this new realization sinks in. This can't be happening. This can't be possible. How is this possible?</p> <p>\"Will,\" I whisper, not able to get a full breath out. \"Please don't tell me-\"</p><p>His face is red and he has a disdained look in his eyes as he bites his lower lip. He leans his head back and looks up at the ceiling, rubbing his palms on his face as he paces the length of the hallway between the lockers and the classroom door. With each step he takes, I catch a glimpse of his faculty badge as it sways back and forth from his neck. He flattens his palms against the lockers, repeatedly tapping his forehead against the metal.</p><p>\"How did I not see this?\" he says as he drops his hands and turns toward me. \"You\u2019re still in high school?\u201d</p><p>4.</p><p>\"I am sick of wanting</p> <p>And it's evil how it's got me</p><p>And every day is worse</p><p>Than the one before.\"</p><p>-The Avett Brothers, Ill With Want</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Will turns and leans with his back against the lockers. His legs are crossed at the feet and his arms are folded across his chest as he stares at the floor. The events unfolding have caught me so off guard, I can barely stand. I go to the wall opposite him and lean against it for support.</p> <p>\u201cMe?\" I reply. \"How did the fact that you\u2019re a teacher not come up? How are you a teacher? You\u2019re only twenty-one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLayken, listen,\u201d he says as he ignores my questions.</p><p>He didn\u2019t call me \u2018Lake.\u2019</p><p>\u201cThere has apparently been a huge misunderstanding between the two of us.\" He doesn't make eye contact with me as he speaks. \u201cWe need to talk about this, but now is definitely not the right time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d I say. I want to say more, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll cry.</p><p>The door to Will\u2019s classroom opens and Eddie emerges. I selfishly pray that she, too, is lost. This cannot be my elective.</p><p>\u201cLayken, I was just coming to look for you,\u201d she smiles. \u201cI saved you a seat.\u201d She looks at Will, then back at me and realizes she's interrupted a conversation. \u201cOh, sorry Mr. Cooper. I didn\u2019t know you were out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine Eddie. I was just going over Layken\u2019s schedule with her.\u201d He says this as he walks toward the classroom and holds the door for both of us.</p> <p>I reluctantly follow Eddie through the door, around Will, and to the only empty seat in the room; directly in front of the teachers\u2019 desk. I don\u2019t know how I am expected to successfully sit through an entire hour in this classroom. The walls won\u2019t stop dancing when I try to focus, so I close my eyes. I need water.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the hottie?\u201d asks the boy I now know as Javier.</p><p>\u201cShut it, Javi!\u201d Will snaps as he walks toward his desk, picking up a stack of papers. Several students let out a small gasp at this reaction. I guess Will isn\u2019t his usual self right now, either.</p><p>\u201cChill out, Mr. Cooper! I was paying her a compliment. She\u2019s hot! Look at her!\u201d Javi says this as he leans back in his chair, watching me.</p><p>\u201cJavi, get out!\u201d Will says as he points to the classroom door.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cooper! Jeez! What\u2019s with the temp? Like I said, I was just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, get out! You will not disrespect women in my classroom!\u201d</p><p>Javi snaps back as he\u2019s grabbing his books. \u201cFine! I\u2019ll go disrespect them in the hallway!\u201d</p><p>After the door shuts behind him, the only sound in the room is the distant second hand ticking on the clock above the blackboard. I don\u2019t turn around, but I can feel most of the eyes in the classroom on me, waiting for some sort of reaction. It\u2019s not so easy to blend in now.</p><p>\u201cClass, we have a new student, this is Layken Cohen,\u201d Will says, attempting to break the tension. \u201cReview is over. Put up your notes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to have her introduce herself?\u201d Eddie asks.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get to that another time.\u201d Will raises up a stack of papers. \u201cTests.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m relieved Will has spared me from having to get in front of the class and speak. It\u2019s the last thing I would be able to do right now. It feels like there is a ball of cotton in my throat as I unsuccessfully try to swallow.</p><p>\u201cLake,\u201d he hesitates, and then clears his throat, realizing his slip. \u201cLayken, if you have something else to work on, feel free. The class is completing a chapter test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather just take the test,\u201d I say. I have to focus on something.</p><p>Will hands me a test, and in the time it takes to complete it I do my best to focus entirely on the questions at hand, hoping I\u2019ll find momentary respite from my new reality. I finish fairly quickly though, but keep erasing and rewriting answers just to avoid having to deal with the obvious; the fact that the boy I was falling in love with is now my teacher.</p><p>When the dismissal bell rings, I watch as the rest of the class files toward Will\u2019s desk, laying their papers face down in a pile. Eddie lays hers down and walks to my desk.</p><p>\u201cHey, did you get your lunch switched?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cSweet. I\u2019ll save you a seat,\u201d she says as she turns to leave. She stops at Will\u2019s desk and he looks up at her. She removes a red tin from her purse and pulls out a small handful of mints and sets them on Will\u2019s desk. \u201cAltoids,\u201d she says as he stares questioningly at the mints. \u201cI\u2019m just making assumptions here,\u201d she whispers loud enough for me to hear her. \u201cBut I\u2019ve heard altoids work wonders on hangovers.\u201d She pushes the mints toward him.</p><p>And again, just like that, she\u2019s gone.</p><p>Will and I are the only ones left in the classroom at this point. I need to talk to him so bad. I have so many questions but I know it\u2019s still not a good time. I grab my paper and walk over to his desk, placing it on top of the stack.</p><p>\u201cIs my mood that obvious?\u201d he asks as he continues to stare at the mints on his desk.</p><p>I grab two of the altoids and walk out of the room without responding.</p><p>As I navigate the halls searching for my fourth period class, I see a bathroom and quickly duck inside. I decide to spend the remainder of fourth period and my entire lunch in the bathroom stall. I feel guilty knowing Eddie is waiting on me but I can\u2019t face anyone right now. Instead, I spend the entire time reading and re-reading the writing on the walls of the stall, doing my best to somehow make it through the rest of the day without bursting out in tears.</p><p>My last two classes are a blur. Luckily, neither of those teachers seem interested in my \u2018about me\u2019 either. I don\u2019t speak to anyone and no one speaks to me. I have no idea if I was ever even assigned homework. My mind is consumed by this whole situation.</p><p>I walk to my car as I search in my bag for my keys. I pull them out and fidget with the lock but my hands are shaking so bad I drop them. When I climb inside I don\u2019t give myself time to reflect as I throw the car in reverse and head home. The only thing I want to think about right now is my bed.</p><p>I pull into my driveway and kill the engine. I don\u2019t want to face Kel or my mother yet, so I kick my seat back and shield my eyes with my arms as I begin to cry. I replay everything over in my head. How did I spend so much time with him and not know he was a teacher? How can something as big as an occupation not come up in conversation? Or better yet, how did I do so much talking and fail to mention the fact that I was still in high school? I\u2019m angry at the whole situation. I told him so much about myself. I feel like it\u2019s what I deserve for finally letting down my walls.</p><p>I wipe at my eyes with my sleeve, trying hard to conceal my tears. I was getting pretty good at it. Up until six months ago, I hardly had reason to cry. My life back in Texas was simple. I had a routine, a great group of friends, a school I loved and even a home I loved. I cried a lot in the weeks following my father\u2019s death until I realized Kel and my mother would not be able to move on until I did. I started making a conscious effort to be involved in Kel's life more. Our father was also his best friend at the time and I feel Kel lost more than any of us. I got involved in youth baseball, his karate lessons and even cub scouts; all the things my dad used to do with him. It kept Kel and I both preoccupied, and the grieving eventually started to subside.</p><p>Until today.</p><p>A tap on the passenger window brings me back to reality. I don't want to acknowledge it. I don't want to see anyone, let alone speak to anyone. I look over and see someone standing there, the only thing visible is their torso...and faculty I.D.</p><p>I flip the visor down and wipe the mascara from my eyes. I divert my attention out the driver side window as I press the automatic unlock button, focusing my gaze on the injured garden gnome who is staring back at me with his smug little grin.</p><p>Will slides into the passenger seat and shuts the door. He lays the seat back a few inches and sighs, but says nothing. I don't think either of us knows what to say at this point.</p><p>I look over at him when he finally does start speaking. His foot is resting on the dash and he's stiff against the seat with his arms folded across his chest. He's staring directly at the note he wrote this morning that is still sitting on my console. I guess he made it by four o'clock after all.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I sit up and turn toward him, pulling my right leg up into the seat, hugging it with my arms. \u201cI\u2019m confused as hell, Will. I don\u2019t know what to think!\u201d</p><p>He sighs and turns to look out the passenger window. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. This is all my fault,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault,\u201d I disagree. \u201cIn order for there to be fault, there has to be some sort of conscious decision. You didn\u2019t know, Will.\u201d</p><p>He sits up and turns to face me. \u201cThat\u2019s just it, Lake. I should have known. I\u2019m in an occupation that doesn\u2019t just require ethics inside the classroom, they apply to all aspects of my life. I wasn\u2019t aware because I wasn\u2019t doing my job. When you told me you were eighteen, I just assumed you were in college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only been eighteen for two weeks,\u201d I reply. I don\u2019t know why I felt the need to clarify that. After I say it I realize it sounds like I\u2019m placing blame on him. He\u2019s already blaming himself; he doesn\u2019t need me to be angry at him too. This was an outcome that neither of us could have possibly predicted.</p><p>\"I student teach,\" he says as he begins to explain. \"Sort of.\"</p><p>\"Sort of?\" I ask.</p><p>\"After my parents died, I doubled up on all my classes. I have enough credits to graduate a semester early. Since the school was so short-handed, they offered me a one year contract. I have three months left of student teaching. After that I'm under contract through June of next year.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I listen as I take in everything he says.

My parents left me with a mound of debt and now college tuition. I can't quit now.\"</p><p>Does he think I'm asking him to quit his job?</p><p>\u201cWill, I understand. I'd never ask you to jeopardize your career. You\u2019ve worked hard. It would be stupid if you threw that away for someone you\u2019ve only known for three days.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying you would ask me that. I just want you to understand where I\u2019m coming from,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI do understand,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous to assume we even have anything worth risking.\u201d</p><p>His eyes glance at the note on my console again as he hesitates. \u201cWe both know it's more than that.\u201d</p><p>His words cause me to wince, because I know deep down he\u2019s right. Whatever was happening with us, it was more than just an infatuation. I can\u2019t possibly comprehend at this moment what it must be like to actually have a broken heart. If it hurts even one percent more than the pain I'm feeling now, I'll forego love. It's not worth it.</p><p>I attempt to stop the tears from welling up again but the effort is futile. He brings his leg off of the dash and pulls me to him. I bury my face in his shirt and he puts his arms around me and gently rubs my back.</p> <p>\"I'm so sorry,\u201d he says. \u201cI wish there was something I could do to change things. I have to do this right, for Caulder. I\u2019m not sure where we go from here, or how we'll transition.\"</p><p>\u201cTransition?\u201d I say. I suddenly start to panic at the thought of losing him. \"But-What if you talk to the school? Tell them we didn\u2019t know. Ask them what our options are...\u201d I realize as the words are coming out of my mouth that I\u2019m grasping at straws. There is no situation in which a relationship between us would be feasible at this point.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Lake.\u201d His voice is small. \"It won't work. It can't work.\"</p><p>We hear a door slam and Kel and Caulder come bounding down the driveway. We immediately pull apart and reposition our seats. I rest my head against the headrest and close my eyes, attempting to conjure up a loophole in our situation. There has to be one.</p><p>When the boys have crossed the street and are safely inside Will's house, he turns to me.</p><p>\u201cLayken?\u201d he says nervously. \u201cThere\u2019s one more thing I need to talk to you about.\"</p> <p>Oh god, what else? What else could be relevant at this moment?</p><p>\"I need you to go to administration tomorrow. I want you to withdraw from my class. I don't think we should be around each other anymore.\"</p><p>I feel the blood rushing from my face. My hands start to sweat and the car is slowly becoming too small for the two of us. He really means it. Anything we had up to this point is over. He\u2019s going to shut me out of his life entirely.</p><p>\"Why?\u201d I make no effort to mask the hurt in my voice.</p><p>He clears his throat. \"I'm not asking you to do this because I want to avoid you. I'm asking you this because what we have isn\u2019t appropriate. We have to separate ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Separate ourselves? My hurt quickly succumbs to the anger building up inside of me. \"Not appropriate? Separate ourselves? You live across the street from me!\"</p><p>He opens the door and gets out of the car. I do the same and slam my door.</p><p>\"We\u2019re both mature enough to know what\u2019s appropriate, Will. You\u2019re the only person I know here. Please don\u2019t ask me to act like I don\u2019t even know you,\u201d I plead.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, Lake! You aren't being fair.\" He matches his tone to mine, and I know I\u2019ve hit a nerve. \u201cI can\u2019t do this. We can\u2019t just be friends. It\u2019s the only choice we have.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but feel like we\u2019re going through a horrible break-up, and we aren\u2019t even in a relationship. I'm so angry at him. At the entire situation. I can\u2019t discern if I\u2019m really just upset about what has happened today, or my entire life this year.</p><p>The one thing I know for sure is that the only time I\u2019ve been truly happy lately has been with Will. To hear him tell me that we can\u2019t even be friends hurts. It scares me that I'll go back to who I've been for the past six months; someone I'm not proud of.</p><p>I open the door to the car and grab my purse and keys. \u201cSo, you\u2019re saying it\u2019s either all or nothing, right? And since it obviously can\u2019t be all!\u201d I slam the car door again and head toward the house. \u201cYou\u2019ll be rid of me by third period tomorrow!\u201d I say as I purposefully kick the gnome over with my boot.</p><p>I walk in the house and throw the keys toward the bar in the kitchen with such force that they glide completely across the surface and hit the floor. I step on the heel of my boot with my toe and kick it off in the entry when my mother comes in.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d she asks. \u201cWere you just yelling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s about. Absolutely nothing!\u201d I pick up my boots and walk to my room, slamming the door behind me.</p><p>I lock my bedroom door and head straight to the hamper of clothes. I pick it up and dump the contents out onto the floor, searching through them until I find what I\u2019m looking for. My hand slides into the pocket of my jeans and I remove the purple hair clip and walk over to the bed, pull back the covers and climb in. I make a tight fist around the clip as I pull my hands up to my face, and I cry myself to sleep.</p><p>When I wake up, it\u2019s midnight. I lay there a moment, hoping I will come to the conclusion that this was all a bad dream but the clarity never comes. When I pull back the covers my hair clip falls from my hands and lands on the floor. This small piece of plastic, so old that it\u2019s probably covered in lead ridden paint. I think about how I felt the day my father gave it to me, and how all the sadness and fears were eliminated as soon as he put it in my hair.</p><p>I lean forward and retrieve it from the floor, pressing down in the center so that it snaps open. I move a section of my bangs to the opposite side and secure it in place on my head. I wait for the magic to take effect, but sure enough, everything still hurts. I pull the clip from my hair and throw it across the room as I climb back into bed.</p><p>5.</p><p>\"I keep tellin' myself</p><p>That it'll be fine.</p><p>You can't make everybody happy</p><p>All of the time.\"</p><p>-The Avett Brothers,Paranoia in B flat Major</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>My pulse is pounding against my temples as I climb out of bed. I\u2019m in dire need of my own box of altoids. My entire body is dragging from hours of alternating between crying and inadequate sleep.</p><p>I make a quick pot of coffee and sit down at the bar and drink it in silence, as I dread the day that lies ahead of me.</p><p>Kel eventually comes in, wearing his pajamas and darth vader house shoes. \u201cMorning,\u201d he says groggily as he grabs a cup out of the sink strainer. He walks over to the coffee pot and proceeds to pour coffee into the World's Greatest Dad cup.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cHey, you aren\u2019t the only one who had a bad night.\u201d Kel climbs onto a stool on the opposite side of the bar. \u201cFourth grade is rough. I had two hours of homework,\u201d he says as he brings the cup to his mouth.</p><p>I take the coffee out of his hands and pour the contents into my own, then toss the mug into the trashcan. I walk to the refrigerator, grab a juice and place it in front of him.</p><p>Kel rolls his eyes and pokes through the hole at the top of the pouch, bringing it to his mouth. \u201cDid you see they delivered the rest of our stuff yesterday? Mom\u2019s van finally got here. We had to unpack the whole thing by ourselves, you know,\u201d he says, obviously trying to guilt me.</p><p>\u201cGo get dressed,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving in half an hour.\u201d</p><p>It begins to snow again just as I drop Kel off at school. I hope Will is right about it being gone soon. I hate the snow. I hate Michigan.</p><p>When I arrive at the school, I go straight to the administration office. Mrs. Alex is powering on her computer when she notices me and shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess, you want 'C' lunch now?\u201d</p><p>I should have brought her Kel\u2019s coffee.</p><p>\u201cActually, I need a list of third period electives. I want to switch classes.\u201d</p><p>She shoots me a questioning glance. \u201cAren\u2019t you in the Poetry elective with Mr. Cooper? That\u2019s one of the more popular electives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one,\u201d I confirm. \u201cI\u2019d like to withdraw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you have until the end of the week before I submit your final schedule,\u201d she says as she grabs a sheet and hands it to me. \u201cWhich class do you prefer?\u201d</p><p>I look over the short list of available electives.</p><p>Botany</p><p>Russian Literature</p><p>My options are limited.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take Russian Literature for two hundred, Alex.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes as she turns and enters the information into the computer. I guess she\u2019s heard that one before. She hands me yet another \u2018new\u2019 new schedule, and a yellow form.</p><p>\u201cHave Mr. Cooper sign this and bring it back to me before third period and you\u2019ll be all set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I mumble as I exit the office.</p><p>When I successfully navigate my way to Will's classroom, I\u2019m relieved to find the door locked and the lights turned out. Seeing him again was not on my to-do list for the day, so I decide to take matters into my own hands. I reach into my backpack and retrieve a pen, press the yellow form up against the door to the classroom, and begin to forge Wills name.</p><p>\"That's not a good idea.\u201d</p><p>I spin around and see Will standing behind me with a black satchel slung across his shoulder, keys in hand. My stomach flips when I look at him. He\u2019s wearing khaki slacks and a black shirt, tucked in at the waist. The color of his tie matches his green eyes perfectly, making them hard to look away from. He looks so, professional.</p><p>I step back as he moves past me and puts his key in the door. He enters the room and flips the light switch on as he places his satchel on the desk. I'm still standing in the doorway when he motions for me to come in.</p><p>I smack the form face up on his desk. \"Well, you weren't here yet, I thought I\u2019d spare you the trouble,\u201d I say, defending my actions with a defensive tone.</p><p>Will picks up the form and grimaces.</p><p>\u201cRussian Lit? That\u2019s what you chose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was either that or Botany,\u201d I reply evenly.</p><p>Will pulls his chair out and sits. He grabs a pen and lays the paper flat, pressing the tip of the pen on the line. He hesitates, though, and lays the pen down on the paper without signing his name.</p><p>\u201cI thought a lot last night...about what you said yesterday,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair of me to ask you to transfer just because it makes me uneasy. We live a hundred yards apart; our brothers are becoming best friends. If anything, this class will be good for us, help us figure out how to navigate when we\u2019re around each other. Besides,\u201d he says this as he pulls a paper from his satchel and shoves it forward on the desk. \u201cYou\u2019ll obviously breeze through.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I look at the test I had completed the day before, and it\u2019s marked with a \u2018100.'</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind switching,\u201d I say. \u201cI understand where you\u2019re coming from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but it can only get easier from here, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I lie. He\u2019s completely wrong. Being around him every day is definitely not going to be easier. I could move back to Texas today and I\u2019d still feel too close to him. However, I still can't come up with a good enough argument for my conscience to convince me to switch classes.</p> <p>He crumples up my transfer form and chucks it toward the trash can. It misses by about two feet. I pick it up as I walk to the door and toss it in.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll see you third period, Mr. Cooper.\u201d</p><p>I see him frown out of my peripheral vision as I exit.</p><p>I feel somewhat relieved. I hated how we had left things yesterday. Even though I would do whatever it took to rectify the awkward situation we\u2019re in, he still somehow finds a way to put me at ease.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you yesterday?\u201d Eddie says as we enter second period. \u201cGet lost again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, sorry about that. Issues with admin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have texted,\u201d she teases in a sarcastic tone. \u201cI was worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry dear.\"</p><p>\u201cDear? You tryin\u2019 to steal my girl?\u201d A guy I have yet to meet puts his arm around Eddie and kisses her on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cLayken, this is Gavin,\u201d she says. \u201cGavin, this is Layken, your competition.\"</p><p>Gavin has blonde hair almost identical to Eddies except in length. They could pass for brother and sister, although his eyes are a chestnut compared to her blues. He is wearing a black hoodie and jeans, and when he moves his arm from Eddie\u2019s shoulder to shake my hand, I notice a tattoo of a heart on his wrist...the same as Eddie\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about you,\u201d he says as he extends his hand.</p><p>I eye him curiously, wondering what he could have possibly heard.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he admits, smiling. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything at all about you. That\u2019s usually just what people say when they\u2019re introduced.\u201d</p><p>He turns toward Eddie and gives her another peck on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll see you next period Babe. I\u2019ve got to get to class.\u201d</p><p>I envy them.</p><p>Mr. Hanushek enters the room and announces there's a chapter test. I don\u2019t object when he hands me a test and we spend the rest of the class period in silence.</p><p>As I follow Eddie through the crowd of students, my stomach is in knots. I\u2019m already regretting not having switched to Russian Literature. How either of us thought this would help make things easier, I don\u2019t know.</p><p>We arrive in Will\u2019s class and he's holding the door open, greeting the students as they arrive.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Cooper, you look a little better today. Need a mint?\u201d Eddie says as she walks to her seat.</p><p>Javi walks in and glares at Will as he slides into his seat.</p><p>\u201cAlright everyone,\u201d Will says as he shuts the door behind him. \u201cGood efforts on the test yesterday. Elements of Poetry is a pretty mundane section so I know you\u2019re all glad to have it out of the way. I think you\u2019ll find the performance section more interesting, which is what we'll focus on the rest of this semester.</p><p>\u201cPerformance Poetry resembles traditional poetry, but with an added element; the actual performance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerformance?\u201d Javi asks, disdained. \u201cYou mean like in that movie about the dead poets? Where they had to read crap in front of the whole class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Will says. \u201cThat\u2019s just poetry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe means slamming,\u201d Gavin adds. \u201cLike they do down at Club N9NE on Thursdays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s slamming?\u201d a girl inquires from the back of the room.</p><p>Gavin turns toward her, \u201cIt\u2019s awesome! Eddie and I go sometimes. You have to see it to really get it,\u201d he adds.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one form of it,\u201d Will says. \u201cHas anyone else ever been to a slam?\u201d</p><p>A couple of other students raise their hand. I don\u2019t.</p><p>\"Mr. Cooper, show them. Do one of yours,\" Gavin says.</p><p>I can see the hesitation in Will's face. I know from experience he doesn\u2019t like being put on the spot.</p><p>\"I'll tell you what. We'll make a deal. If I do one of my pieces, everyone has to agree to go to at least one slam this semester at Club N9NE.\"</p><p>No one objects. I'd like to object, but that would require raising my hand and speaking. So, I don't object.</p><p>\"No objections? Alright, then. I'll do a short one I wrote. Remember, slam poetry is about the poetry and the performance.\"</p><p>Will stands in the front of the room and faces the students. He shakes his arms out and stretches his neck left and right in an attempt to relax himself. When he clears his throat, it's not the kind of throat clearing people do when they're nervous; it's the kind they do right before they yell.</p><p>Expectations, evaluations, internal evasions</p><p>Fly out of me like puddles of blood from a wound</p><p>A fetus from the womb of a corpse in a tomb</p><p>Withered and strewn like red sheets on the bed</p><p>Of an immaculate room.</p><p>I can't breathe,</p><p>I can't win,</p><p>From this indelible position I'm in</p><p>It controls the only piece of my unfortunate soul</p><p>Left to fend for itself in this hollowed out hole</p><p>That I dug from within, like a prisoner in</p><p>An unlocked cell sitting in the deepest pits of hell</p><p>Unencumbered he's not in his sweltering spot</p><p>He could open the door 'cause he don't need a damn key</p><p>But then again,</p><p>Why would he?</p><p>Circumlocution is his revolution.</p><p>The silence in the room is deafening. No one speaks, no one moves, no one claps. We are in awe. I am in awe. How does he expect me to transition if he keeps doing things like this?</p><p>\"There you go,\" he says matter-of-factly as he walks back to his seat. The rest of the class period is spent talking about slam poetry. I try hard to follow along as he goes into further explanation, but the entire time I\u2019m simply focused on the fact that he hasn\u2019t made eye contact with me. Not even once.</p><p>I claim my seat next to Eddie at lunch as we set our trays down. I notice a guy that sits a couple of rows behind me in Will\u2019s class walking toward us. He is balancing two trays with his left arm, and his back pack and a bag of chips in the right. He positions himself in the seat across from me and proceeds to combine the food onto one tray. When that task is complete, he pulls a two-liter of coke out of his backpack and places it in front of him, unscrewing the lid and drinking directly from it. As he is chugging the soda, he looks at me and places it back down on the table, wiping his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna drink that chocolate milk, New Girl?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cThat\u2019s why I got it.\"</p><p>\u201cWhat about that roll? You gonna eat that roll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot the roll for a reason, too.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs and reaches across to Gavin\u2019s tray and takes his roll just as Gavin turns around and swipes at his hand, a moment too late.</p><p>\u201cDude, Nick! There\u2019s no way you\u2019re gaining ten pounds by Friday. Give it up!\u201d Gavin yells.</p><p>\u201cNine,\u201d Nick corrects him with a mouthful of bread.</p><p>Eddie takes her roll and throws it across the table. Nick catches it midair and gives her a wink. \u201cYour girl has faith in me,\u201d Nick says to Gavin.</p><p>\u201cHe lifts weights,\u201d Eddie is directing her comment to me. \u201cHe\u2019s got to be nine pounds heavier by Friday to compete in his weight class, and it\u2019s not looking good.\u201d</p><p>With that, I grab my roll and toss it on Nick\u2019s tray. He winks at me as he dips it in a mound of butter.</p><p>I\u2019m thankful to Eddie for accepting me into her group of friends so easily. Not that I had a decision, it was done pretty forcibly. In Texas there were twenty-one people in my entire senior class. I had friends, but with such a limited pool to choose from I never really considered any of them to be my best friend. I mostly hung out with my friend Kerris, but I haven\u2019t even spoken to her since the move. From what I\u2019ve seen of Eddie so far, she\u2019s intriguing enough that I can\u2019t help but hope we become closer.</p><p>\u201cSo, how long have you and Gavin been dating?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cSophomore Year. I hit him with my car.\u201d She looks at him and smiles. \u201cIt was love at first swipe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asks. \u201cYou got a boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>I wish I could tell her about Will. I want to tell her about how when we met, I immediately felt something I have never felt about a guy before. I want to tell her about our first date and how the entire night seemed like we had known each other for years. I want to tell her about his poetry, our kiss, everything. Most of all though, I want to tell her about seeing him in the hallway when we realized our fate was not our own to decide. I want to tell her how much I am hurting, knowing I can\u2019t talk to him. But I know I can\u2019t. I can't tell anyone. So I don\u2019t. I simply reply, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? No boyfriend? Well, we can fix that,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cNo need. It\u2019s not broken.\u201d</p><p>Eddie laughs and turns to Gavin, discussing possible suitors for her new, lonely friend.</p><p>The end of the school week finally arrives and I have never felt more relieved to pull out of a parking lot in my entire life. Even though he lives across the street from me, I feel less vulnerable when I\u2019m inside my house than I do two feet from him in a classroom. He successfully achieved an entire week of absolutely no eye contact. Not saying I didn\u2019t do my best to catch even a glimpse in my direction, I practically stared him down.</p><p>I plan to tell my mother everything that happened. I just haven't found the right time yet. She's been leaving for work before dinner every night so we really haven't had a chance to talk about Will.</p><p>During the drive home, I make a detour to better formulate my plan to spend the entire weekend indoors. It\u2019s called movies and junk food.</p><p>Mom is sitting at the bar in the kitchen when I walk through the front door. I can see by the stern look on her face that she isn\u2019t particularly happy to see me. I walk into the kitchen and lay the movies and bags of junk food on the counter in front of her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m spending the weekend with Johnny Depp,\u201d I say, attempting to appear oblivious to her demeanor.</p><p>She doesn't smile.</p><p>\u201cI took Caulder home from school today,\u201d she says. \"He mentioned something very interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? You sound sick Mom. Do you have a cold?\u201d I try to sound nonchalant, but I can tell by the tone in her voice that what she\u2019s really trying to say is, \"I found out something from your little brother\u2019s friend that I should have found out from you.\"</p><p>\u201cAnything you want to tell me?\u201d she asks, staring daggers through me.</p><p>I sip from a bottle of water and take a seat at the bar. I had planned on talking to her about everything tonight but it looks like it\u2019s going to happen sooner rather than later.</p><p>\u201cMom. I was going to talk to you about it. I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a teacher at your school, Lake!\u201d She starts coughing and grabs at a kleenex as she gets up from the bar. After she regains her composure, she lowers her voice as she continues speaking in an attempt to avoid garnering attention from the nine-year-olds that are somewhere within our vicinity. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s something you should have mentioned before I allowed you out of the house with him?\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know!

Don\u2019t you realize he's raising his little brother? This can ruin his-\u201d</p><p>Both of our eyes dart to the front door as we hear Will\u2019s car pull into his driveway. I quickly head to the front door in an attempt to block it so she'll let me explain. She beats me to it so I follow her outside, pleading.</p> <p>\u201cMom, please. Just let me explain everything. Please.\u201d</p><p>She is walking up Will\u2019s driveway when he notices us bombarding him. He smiles when he first notices my mother, but his smile fades when he sees I\u2019m right behind her. He has surmised that this is not a friendly visit.</p><p>\u201cJulia, please. Can we go inside to talk about this?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t respond, she just marches toward his front door and lets herself in.</p><p>Will looks at me questioningly.</p> <p>\u201cYour brother mentioned you were a teacher. I haven\u2019t had a chance to explain anything to her,\u201d I say. He sighs as we make our way inside.</p><p>It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been inside his home since I found out about the death of his parents. Nothing has changed, yet at the same time everything has changed. That first day when I sat at his bar, I assumed that everything in the house belonged to his parents; that Will\u2019s situation was not unlike my own. Now when I take in my surroundings, it sheds a different light on him. A light of responsibility. Maturity.</p><p>My mother is sitting stiffly on the sofa. Will walks quietly across the room and sits on the edge of the couch across from her. He leans forward and clasps his hands in front of him, his elbows resting on his knees.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain everything.\u201d He says this with a serious, respectful tone to his voice.</p><p>\u201cI know you will,\u201d she replies evenly.</p><p>\u201cBasically, what it boils down to is that I made a lot of assumptions. I thought she was older. She seemed older. Once she told me she was eighteen, I guess I assumed she was in college. It's only September, most students aren't eighteen when they start their senior year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMost of them. She\u2019s only been eighteen for two weeks.\"</p><p>\u201cYeah, I...I realize that now,\u201d he stutters, shooting a look in my direction.</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t attending school the first week you guys moved in, so I guess I just assumed. Somehow the topic never came up while we were together.\u201d</p><p>My mother starts to cough again. Will and I wait, but the coughing intensifies and she stands and takes a few deep breaths. I would think she's having a panic attack if I didn\u2019t already know she was coming down with something. Will goes to the kitchen and comes back with a glass of water. She takes a sip and turns toward the living room window that faces the front yard. Caulder and Kel are outside now, I can hear them laughing. My mother walks to the front door and opens it.</p><p>\"Kel, Caulder! Don't lay in the street!\" She coughs again as she closes the door and turns toward us.</p><p>\u201cTell me, when did the topic come up?\u201d she asks, looking at both of us now.</p><p>I can't answer her. Somehow in the presence of the two of them, I feel small. Two adults hashing it out in front of the children. That's what this feels like.</p><p>\u201cWe didn't find out until she showed up in my class,\u201d Will replies.</p> <p>My mother looks at me and her jaw gapes open. \u201cYou\u2019re in his class?\u201d She looks at Will and repeats what she said. \u201cShe\u2019s in your class?\u201d</p><p>God it sounds really bad coming from her mouth. She stands up and paces the length of the living room as both Will and I allow her time to process.</p><p>\u201cYou're telling me that both of you deny having any knowledge of this prior to the first day of school?\u201d</p><p>We both nod in agreement.</p><p>\u201cWell what the hell happens now?\u201d she asks. She has both of her hands on her hips. Will and I are silent, hoping she can magically come up with the solution that we\u2019ve both been searching for all week.</p><p>\u201cWell, Lake and I are doing our best to work through this a day at a time,\u201d he finally replies.</p><p>She glares at him accusingly. \u201cLake? You call her Lake?\u201d</p><p>Will looks down at the floor and clears his throat.</p><p>My mother sighs and takes a seat next to Will on the sofa. \u201cBoth of you need to accept the severity of this situation. I know my daughter, and my daughter likes you, Will. A lot. If you share even a fraction of those feelings, you will do whatever you can to distance yourself from her. That includes ditching the nicknames. This will jeopardize your career, and her reputation.\u201d She stands up and walks to the front door, holding it open for me to follow her out. She wasn\u2019t allowing us the opportunity for any private time.</p><p>Kel and Caulder brush past us as they run into Caulder's bedroom. Mom's eyes follow after them as she gazes down the hallway that the two boys just ran through.</p><p>\"Kel and Caulder don't need to be affected by this,\" she says as she brings her attention back to Will. \"I suggest we work something out now so that the contact between you and my Lake can be minimized.\"</p><p>\"Absolutely. I completely agree,\" he says.</p><p>\"I sleep in the mornings. If you want to take them to school, Lake or I will pick them up after school. Where they go from there can be up to them. They seem to do pretty well going back and forth.\"</p><p>\"That sounds good. Thank you.\"</p><p>\"He's a good kid, Will.\"</p><p>\"Really, Julia. It's all fine with me. I haven\u2019t seen Caulder this happy in a ...\u201d Will\u2019s voice trails off and he doesn\u2019t finish his sentence.</p><p>\u201cJulia?\u201d he asks. \u201cWill you be talking to the school about this? I mean, I completely understand if that\u2019s what you need to do. I would just like to be prepared, beforehand.\u201d</p><p>She looks at him, then at me and holds her stare as she speaks. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing currently going on that I would need to inform them about, is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I swear,\u201d I quickly reply. I want Will to look at me so he can see the apology in my eyes, but he doesn't. As soon as he shuts his front door behind us, I can\u2019t hold my tongue any longer.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d I yell. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even give me the opportunity to explain!\u201d I dart across the street and don't look back at her as I run into the house and into the solitude of my bedroom where I will remain until she's left for work.</p><p>\u201cLayken, do we have any packets of Kool-Aid?\u201d Kel is standing in the entryway, covered in snow slush.</p><p>It\u2019s not the oddest thing he\u2019s ever asked me for, so I don\u2019t question him as I grab a package of grape out of the kitchen cabinet and take it to him.</p><p>\u201cNot purple, we need red,\u201d he commands. I grab the purple package from his hands and return with a red one.</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d</p><p>I close the door behind him and grab a towel and lay it down on the tile of the entryway. It\u2019s not even nine in the morning and already Kel and Caulder have been outside in the snow for over two hours.</p><p>I take a seat at the bar and finish my cup of coffee, staring at the pile of junk food that I\u2019m no longer excited about eating. My mother got home around seven-thirty this morning and climbed into bed where she\u2019ll stay until around two o\u2019clock. I\u2019m still angry with her and don\u2019t feel like confronting the situation at all today, so it looks like I have about five more hours before I\u2019ll lock myself in my bedroom again. I grab a movie off the bar and, despite my lack of appetite, a bag of chocolate. If there is any man who can take my mind off of Will, it\u2019s definitely Johnny Depp.</p><p>Halfway through my movie, Kel comes bounding in the house, still covered in snow and slush as he grabs my hand and starts to pull me outside.</p><p>\u201cKel, stop. I\u2019m not going outside!\u201d I snap.</p><p>\u201cPlease? Just for a minute. You have to see the snowman we made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Let me get some shoes on at least.\u201d</p><p>I put my shoes on and Kel grabs my hand again and pulls me out the door. I continue to allow Kel to pull me along as I shield my eyes. It\u2019s taking them a moment to adjust to the suns reflection on the snow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s right over here,\u201d I hear Caulder saying, but not to me. I look up to see Caulder handling his brother in the same way that Kel is handling me. We are both led to the rear of the jeep where they position us inches apart, directly in front of a casualty.</p><p>I now know the purpose behind the demand for red Kool-Aid. In front of us, lying flat on the ground beneath the rear of my jeep, is a dead snowman. His eyes are small pieces of twig, shaped into a grim expression. His arms are two thin branches lying at his side, one of them broken in half under my rear tire. His head and neck are sprinkled with a trail of red Kool-Aid that leads to a pool of bright red snow about a foot down from the snowman.</p><p>\u201cHe was in a terrible accident,\u201d Kel says seriously before he and Caulder break out into a fit of giggles.</p><p>Will and I look at one another, and for the first time in a week, he smiles at me.</p><p>\u201cWow, I need my camera,\u201d he says.</p><p>\"I\u2019ll grab mine,\u201d I say as I head back inside.</p><p>So this is what it\u2019s going to be like from now on? Conversing under false pretenses in front of our brothers, avoiding each other in public? I hate the transition.</p><p>When I return with the camera, the boys are still admiring the murder scene as I snap a couple of pictures.</p><p>\u201cKel, let\u2019s kill a snowman with Will\u2019s car now,\u201d Caulder says before they dart across the street.</p><p>The tension is thick as Will and I stare excessively at the snowman in front of us, not knowing what else to look at. He eventually glances toward his house at our brothers.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re lucky to have each other you know,\u201d he says quietly.</p><p>I analyze this sentence and wonder if it has a deeper meaning, or if he was simply just making an observation.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they are,\u201d I agree.</p><p>We both stand there watching them gather more snow when he takes a deep breath and stretches his arms out above his head.</p><p>\u201cWell, I better get back inside,\u201d he says. He turns away.</p><p>\u201cWill, wait.\u201d He swings back around and puts his hands in his pockets, but doesn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about yesterday. About my mom,\u201d I say as I stare at the ground between us. I can't look him in the eye for two reasons. One, the snow is still blinding me; two, it hurts for me to look at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Layken.\u201d</p><p>And we\u2019re back to the official first name.</p><p>He stares at the ground where the \u2018blood\u2019 has tinted the snow and he kicks at it with his shoe. \u201cShe\u2019s just doing her job as a mom, you know.\u201d Sadness spreads across his face as he speaks. \u201cDon\u2019t be so mad at her. You\u2019re lucky to have her.\u201d</p><p>He spins and walks back to his house. Guilt overcomes me as I think of what it's like for them to just have each other, and here I sit complaining about the only parent left between the four of us. I feel ashamed for bringing it up. I feel more ashamed having even been mad at my mother for what she did. It was my fault for not talking to her about it sooner. Will is right, as usual. I am lucky to have her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The shower in my mother\u2019s bedroom is running after lunch, so I heat up some leftovers and make her a glass of tea. I place them at her usual seat at the bar and wait for her. When she finally emerges from the hallway and sees the food, she gives me a slight smile and takes her seat.</p><p>\u201cIs this a peace offering or did you poison my food?\u201d she asks as she unfolds a napkin into her lap.</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019ll have to eat it first to find out.\u201d</p><p>She eyes me cautiously and takes a bite of her food. She chews for a minute and takes another bite after she fails to keel over.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mom. I should have talked to you about it sooner. I was just really upset.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me with pity in her eyes so I turn away from her and busy my hands with the dishes.</p><p>\u201cLake, I know how much you like him, I do. I like him too. But like I said yesterday, this can\u2019t happen. You have to promise me you won\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear, Mom. He\u2019s made it clear he wants nothing to do with me, so you don\u2019t have anything to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not,\u201d she says as she continues to eat.</p> <p>I finish up the dishes and return to the living room to continue my affair with Johnny.</p><p>6.</p><p>\u201cYour heart says not again</p><p>What kind of mess have you got me in?</p><p>But when the feeling's there</p><p>It can lift you up and take you anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>-The Avett Brothers, Living of Love</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>The next three weeks fly by as my homework gets more intense, along with the isolation in Will\u2019s classroom. We haven\u2019t spoken since the day the snowman was murdered. We haven\u2019t had eye contact since then either. He avoids me like the plague.</p><p>I haven't been adjusting very well to Michigan. Maybe everything that happened with Will ended up making the move even harder. All I ever feel like doing is sleeping. I guess because it doesn't hurt as bad when you're asleep.</p><p>Eddie keeps bringing up possible fillers for the obvious hole in my boyfriend department, but I\u2019ve rejected them all. She has finally resorted to switching places in Will\u2019s class with Nick in the hopes that something will bloom there.</p><p>It won\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHey, Layken,\u201d Nick smiles as he sits in his new spot nearest me. \u201cGot another one for ya. Wanna hear it?\u201d</p><p>In the past week alone, I\u2019ve had to endure at least three Chuck Norris jokes a day from Nick. He incorrectly assumes that since I\u2019m from Texas, I must be obsessed with \"Walker, Texas Ranger.\"</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d I don\u2019t try to deny him this privilege anymore, it doesn\u2019t work.</p><p>\u201cChuck Norris got a g-mail account today. It\u2019s</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ .\"</p><p>It takes me a second to process. I\u2019m normally quick with jokes, but my mind has been sluggish lately, and for good reason.</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d I reply flatly in order to appease him.</p><p>\u201cChuck Norris counted to infinity. Twice.\u201d</p><p>As much as I didn\u2019t feel like laughing, I did. Nick did annoy me quite a bit, but his ignorance was endearing.</p><p>When Will walks into the classroom, his eyes dart to Nick. Although he still doesn\u2019t look at me, I like to imagine a twinge of jealousy building up inside of him. I\u2019ve been making it a point recently, once Will comes into the room, to become more attentive toward Nick. I hate this new desire that has overcome me; the desire to make Will jealous. I know I need to stop before Nick starts to get the wrong idea, but I can\u2019t. I feel like this is the only aspect of this entire situation that I have any control over.</p><p>\u201cGet out your notebooks, we\u2019re making poetry today,\u201d Will says as he takes a seat at his desk. Half the class groans. I hear Eddie clapping.</p><p>\u201cCan we have partners?\u201d Nick asks as he starts inching his desk toward mine.</p><p>Will glares at him. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugs and scoots his desk back into place.</p><p>\u201cEach of you needs to write a short poem which you will perform in front of the class tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I start taking notes on the assignment, not willing to watch him as he speaks. Remaining in his class was a very bad idea. I can't focus on anything he's saying. I'm constantly wondering what's going on inside his head, if he's thinking about us, what he does inside his house at night. Even at home he\u2019s been the only thing I can think about. I find myself stealing glances across the street any chance I get. Honestly, if I would have just switched classes it probably wouldn't have made a difference. I would just rush home and beat him in the driveway so I could watch from the window when he pulls up to the house. This game I'm playing with myself is so exhausting. I wish I could find a way to let go of the hold he has on me. He seems to have done a pretty good job of moving on.</p><p>\u201cYou just need to start out with about ten sentences for tomorrow's presentation. We can expand over the next couple of weeks, giving you something to prepare for the slam,\u201d Will says. \u201cAnd don\u2019t think I haven\u2019t forgotten. So far no one in here has shown up at the slam. We made a deal.\u201d</p><p>The entire class starts to protest.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the deal! You said we just had to observe. Now we have to perform?\u201d says Gavin.</p><p>\u201cNo. Well, technically not. Everyone in here is required to attend one slam. You aren't required to perform, I just want you to observe. However, there\u2019s a chance you could be chosen to be the sacrifice, so it wouldn't hurt to have something prepared.\u201d</p><p>Several students ask what the sacrifice is in unison. Will explains the term and how it can be anyone chosen at random. Therefore, he wants everyone to have a piece ready before the night they are to attend, just in case.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we want to perform?\u201d Eddie asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what. We\u2019ll make one more deal. Whomever willingly slams will be exempt from the final.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet, I\u2019m in,\u201d Eddie says.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we don\u2019t go?\u201d Javi asks.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re missing out on something amazing. And you get an F for participation,\u201d he replies.</p><p>Javi rolls his eyes and groans at Will's response.</p><p>\u201cSo, what kinds of things can we write about?\u201d Eddie asks.</p><p>Will moves to the front of the desk and sits, only inches from me.</p><p>\u201cThere are no rules, you can write about anything. You can write about love, food, your hobby, something significant that\u2019s happened in your life. You can write about how much you hate your Poetry teacher. Write about anything, as long as it\u2019s something you\u2019re passionate about. If the audience doesn\u2019t feel your passion, they won\u2019t feel you\u2014and that\u2019s never fun, believe me.\u201d He says this as though he speaks from experience.</p><p>\u201cWhat about sex? Can we write about that?\u201d Javi asks. It\u2019s obvious he\u2019s trying to push Will\u2019s buttons. Will remains cool.</p><p>\u201cAnything. As long as it doesn\u2019t get you in hot water with your parents. I\u2019ll be sending permission slips home for the slam at the end of the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if they don\u2019t let us go? I mean, it is a club,\u201d A student asks from the back of the room.</p><p>\u201cI understand if they have hesitations. If there are any parents that don\u2019t feel comfortable, I\u2019ll talk to them about it. I also don\u2019t want transportation to be an issue. This club is somewhat of a drive, so if it\u2019s an issue, I\u2019ll take a school vehicle. Whatever the obstacle, we\u2019ll work through it. I\u2019m very passionate about Slam Poetry and don\u2019t feel I\u2019ll be doing justice as your teacher if I don\u2019t allow you the opportunity to experience this in person.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll answer questions throughout the week regarding the semester requirement. But for now, let's get back to today's assignment. You have the entire class period to complete the poem. We\u2019ll start presenting them tomorrow. Get to it.\u201d</p><p>I open my notebook and lay it flat on my desk. I stare at it, not having the first clue as to what to write about. The only thing that\u2019s been on my mind lately is Will and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m doing a poem about him.</p><p>By the end of the class period, the only thing that\u2019s written on my paper is my name. I glance up to Will who is seated at his desk, biting the corner of his bottom lip. His eyes are focused on my desk, down on the poem that I\u2019ve yet to write. He glances up and sees me watching him. It\u2019s the first eye contact we\u2019ve had in three weeks. Surprisingly, he doesn\u2019t immediately look away. If he had any idea how this lip biting quirk affected me, he'd stop. The intensity in his eyes causes me to flush as the room suddenly becomes warm. His stare is impenetrable by nothing but the final class dismissal bell. He stands and walks to the door, holding it open for the students exiting. I immediately put away my notebook and throw my bag over my shoulder. I don\u2019t make eye contact when I leave the classroom, but I can feel him watching me.</p><p>Just when I think he\u2019s forgotten about me, he goes and does something like this. The entire rest of the day I\u2019m extremely quiet as I attempt to analyze his actions. I eventually come up with just one conclusion: He\u2019s just as confused as I am.</p><p>I\u2019m relieved to feel the warm sun beating down on my face as I walk toward my jeep. The weather has been insanely cold going into October. The predictions are that the next two weeks will be a nice respite from the snow before the full winter season begins. I insert the key into the ignition and turn it.</p><p>Nothing happens.</p><p>Great, my jeep is shot. I have no idea what I'm doing, but I pop the hood on the jeep and take a look. There's a bunch of wires and metal, that's about all I can comprehend from a mechanical standpoint. I do know what the battery looks like so I grab a crowbar from the trunk and tap it against the battery. After a failed attempt at getting the ignition to turn over again, I resort to pounding a little harder until I'm pretty much bludgeoning the battery out of sheer frustration.</p><p>\"That's not a good idea.\"</p><p>Will walks up beside me, satchel across his chest, looking very much like a teacher and less like Will.</p><p>\"You've made it clear that you don't think a lot of what I do is a very good idea,\" I say as I return my focus back under the hood.</p><p>\"What's wrong, it won't crank?\" He bends forward under the hood and starts to mess with wires.</p><p>I don't understand what he's doing. One day he tells me he doesn't want to speak to me, the next minute he\u2019s staring me down in class and now he's under my hood trying to help me. I'm not a fan of inconsistency.</p><p>\"What are you doing, Will?\"</p><p>He rises out from under the hood and cocks his head at me. \"What does it look like I'm doing? I'm trying to figure out what's wrong with your jeep.\" He walks around to the driver's side and gets in, attempting to turn the ignition.</p><p>I follow him to the door. \"I mean, why are you doing this? You\u2019ve made it pretty clear you don\u2019t want me to speak to you.\"</p><p>\"Layken, you're a student stranded in the parking lot. I'm not going to get in my car and just drive away.\"</p><p>His comparison, although accurate, hurts. He realizes his poor choice of words and sighs as he gets out of the car and looks back under the hood.</p><p>\"Look, that's not how I meant it,\" he says as he fidgets with more wires. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I lean under the hood next to him in an attempt to look natural as I continue my point.</p><p>\"It's just really hard, Will. It was so easy for you to accept this and move past it. It hasn't been that easy for me. It's all I think about.\"</p><p>Will grips the edge of the hood with his hands as he turns his head toward me.</p><p>\"You think this is easy for me?\" he whispers.</p> <p>\"Well, that's how you make it seem.\"</p><p>\"Lake, nothing about this has been easy. It's a daily struggle for me to come to work, knowing this very job is what's keeping us apart.\" He turns away from the car and leans against it. \"If it weren't for Caulder, I would have quit that first day I saw you in the hallway. I could have taken the year off...waited until you graduated to go back.\" He turns toward me, his voice lower than before. \"Believe me, I\u2019ve ran every possible scenario through my mind. How do you think it makes me feel to know that I'm the reason you're hurting? That I'm the reason you're so sad?\"</p><p>The sincerity in his voice is surprising. I had no idea. Over the last couple of weeks, I'd convinced myself he must have never even cared to begin with.</p><p>\"I-I\u2019m sorry. I just thought-\"</p><p>Will cuts me off mid-sentence and turns back toward the car. \"Your battery is fine, looks like it might be your alternator.\"</p> <p>\"Car won't start?\" Nick asks as he walks up beside us, explaining the reason behind Will's sudden guarded behavior.</p><p>\"No, Mr. Cooper thinks I need a new alternator.\"</p><p>\"That sucks,\" Nick says as he glances under the hood. \"I'll give you a ride home if you need one.\"</p><p>I start to decline when Will interrupts.</p><p>\"That would be great, Nick,\" Will says as he closes the hood of the jeep.</p><p>I shoot Will a glance and he ignores my silent protest. Will walks away and leaves me with Nick and no other option for a ride home.</p> <p>\"I'm parked over here,\" Nick says as he leads the way to his car.</p><p>\"Let me grab my stuff first.\" I reach for my bag and my hand goes up to find the ignition empty. Will must have accidentally taken my keys. I leave the door unlocked just in case he doesn't have them. I don't want to add a locksmith charge on top of our already mounting debt.</p><p>\u201cWow. Nice car,\u201d I say as we reach Nicks vehicle. It\u2019s a small black sports car. Not sure what kind but there isn\u2019t a spec of dirt on it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not mine,\u201d he says as we climb inside. \u201cIt\u2019s my dads. He lets me drive it when he\u2019s off work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, it\u2019s nice. Do you mind if we swing by Chapman Elementary? I\u2019m supposed to pick up my little brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d he says as he turns left out of the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cSo, New Girl. You miss Texas yet?\u201d Although it\u2019s been a month, he still calls me new girl.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I reply shortly.</p> <p>He attempts to make more small talk but I treat his questions as if they are rhetorical, even if they aren't. I can't stop thinking about the things Will said to me before Nick interrupted us. Nick finally grasps the idea that I'm not in a chatty mood so he turns on the radio.</p><p>We pull up to Kel\u2019s school and I get out of the car so Kel can spot me, since I\u2019m not in my jeep. When Kel notices me, he comes running up to me, followed by Caulder. \u201cHey, where's your jeep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t start. Hop in, Nick is giving us a ride home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well Caulder is supposed to go with us today.\"</p><p>I open the back door as the two climb in the small backseats. They immediately start oohing and aahing. The remainder of the short drive consists of transformer comparisons and Nick's car.</p><p>When we arrive at the house, Kel and Caulder jump out of the car and run inside. I thank Nick and follow the boys toward the house when I hear Nick open his door.</p><p>\u201cLayken, wait,\u201d Nick calls after me.</p><p>Ugh. Almost in the clear. I turn to see him standing in my driveway, looking nervous.</p><p>\u201cLater this week, Eddie and Gavin and I are going to Getty\u2019s. You wanna come?\u201d</p><p>I definitely should have laid off on the obvious flirtation with Nick. I feel guilty, knowing good and well I\u2019ve sent him the wrong signals.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I'd have to run it by my mom. I\u2019ll let you know tomorrow, okay?\u201d I see the hope fill his eyes and wish I would have went ahead and turned him down. I don't want to give him any more false hope than I already have.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Tomorrow. See ya.\u201d Nick gets back in his car and drives away.</p><p>When I walk in the house, Kel and Caulder are both at the bar with their homework out. \"Caulder, do you live with us now or what?\"</p><p>He looks at me with his big, green, Will-looking eyes. \"I can go home if you want me to.\"</p><p>\"No. I was just kidding. I like you being here, it keeps this little creeper away from me.\" I squeeze Kel's shoulders then walk into the kitchen and grab a drink.</p><p>\"So is that Nick guy your boyfriend? I thought my brother was going to be your boyfriend.\"</p><p>Juice spews from my mouth as Caulder catches me off guard with his observation. \"No, neither of them are my boyfriend. Your brother and I are just friends, Caulder.\"</p><p>\"But Layken,\" Kel gives Caulder a mischievous grin. \"I saw you kissing him that night y'all came home. In the driveway. I was watching from my bedroom window.\"</p><p>My heart jumps to my throat. I walk over to them and place my hands firmly on the bar in front of them.</p><p>\"Kel, don't ever repeat what you just said do you hear me?\"</p><p>His eyes get big and he and Caulder both lean back in their chairs as I lean forward across the bar.</p><p>\"I'm serious. You did not see what you thought you saw. Will can get in a lot of trouble if you repeat what you said. I mean it.\"</p><p>They both nod as I leave the room. I pull my notebook out of my bag and throw it on the bed, plopping down next to it to start on my homework, but I can\u2019t. The thought of anything getting out about Will and I distracts me. As much as I hate the fact that we can't be together, I hate the thought of him getting fired even more. He needs this job. Will was only one year older than me when his parents died, and he essentially became a parent himself. The more thought I give it, the guiltier I feel for being so hard on Will and the decision he's made. The pain I'm feeling as a result of us not being together pales in comparison to what Will must be going through. I feel less and less like Will's peer every day and more like his student.</p><p>I decide to work on the poem I\u2019ve yet to start, but after half an hour I\u2019m still staring at a blank page when my mother walks in.</p><p>\"Where's your jeep?\"</p><p>\"Oh, I forgot to tell you. It won't crank, alternator or something. It's parked at school.\"</p><p>\"How can you forget to mention that?\" she says, obviously frustrated.</p><p>\"I'm sorry. You were sleeping when I got home. I know you\u2019ve been sick this week so I didn\u2019t want to wake you up.\"</p><p>She sighs as she sits on my bed. \"I don\u2019t know when I'll be able to get it fixed. I work the next few days. Do you mind just keeping it at the school for a couple days until I can work it out?\"</p><p>\"I'll ask tomorrow. I doubt they would even notice it\u2019s there.\"</p><p>\"Okay. Well, I've got to get to work.\u201d She stands up to leave.</p><p>\u201cWait. Your shift doesn\u2019t start for a few more hours.\"</p><p>\"I need to run errands.\" She shuts the door, leaving me to question the validity of her response.</p><p>I'm drying my hair after my shower when I think I hear the doorbell. I turn the dryer off and listen for a moment and it eventually rings again.</p><p>\"Kel, get the door!\" I yell as I pull on my sweats. I pile my still-wet hair into a band and double it up on top of my head as I throw on a tank top. The doorbell rings again.</p><p>\"Kel!\" I yell as I make my way to the front door. I check the peep hole and see Will standing outside, his arms crossed as he trembles. My heart skips a beat at the sight of him and I turn to check my reflection in the entryway mirror. Sure enough, I look like I just got out of the shower. At least I'm not wearing Kel's house shoes. Ugh. Why do I even care?</p><p>I open the door and motion for him to come inside. He steps in far enough for me to shut the door behind him but doesn't come any further inside.</p><p>\u201cI just need Caulder. Bath time.\u201d</p><p>His arms are still crossed and his speech is curt. I take this as a sign that I'm not going to get any confessions out of him right now, so I tell him to give me a sec as I go fetch Caulder.</p><p>I check Kel's room, my mother's room and eventually my room when I run out of rooms to check.</p><p>\"They aren't here, Will.\" I say as I walk back into the living room.</p><p>\"Well, they have to be. They aren't at my house.\" He makes his way down the hallway and checks the rooms as he calls for them. I open the patio door, flick on the outdoor switch and make a quick scan of the small backyard.</p><p>\"They aren't out back,\" I say as we meet back in the living room.</p><p>\"I'll check my house again,\" he says.</p><p>Will makes his way across the street as I follow behind him. It's dark outside and the temperature has dropped since earlier in the day. I become increasingly concerned as we make our way to Will's house. I know Kel and Caulder wouldn't be outside this time of night. If they aren\u2019t in one of the houses, I don't know where they could be.</p><p>Will makes a quick run of his house. I don't feel comfortable walking through it since I\u2019ve never really been further than the kitchen, so I stand in the doorway and wait.</p><p>\"They aren't here,\" he says, unable to hide the uncertainty in his voice. My hands go to my mouth as I gasp, fully realizing the seriousness of the situation. Will can see the fear in my eyes and he puts his arms around me.</p><p>\"We'll find them. They\u2019re just off playing somewhere.\" His reassurance is brief as he lets go and heads back out the front door. \"Check the backyard; I'll meet you out front,\" he says.</p><p>We are both calling the boys\u2019 names when the panic rises up in my chest. It reminds me of the time I was babysitting Kel when he was four, and I thought I had lost him. I searched the entire house for twenty minutes before finally breaking down and calling my mother. She immediately called the police who arrived within minutes. They were still searching when she finally made it home-the panic in her eyes when she walked through the door cut through me and we both started to cry. After searching for over fifteen minutes, an officer found Kel passed out on the folded towels in the bathroom cabinet. Apparently he had been hiding from me when he fell asleep.</p><p>I\u2019m hoping to find the same sense of relief when I look through Will\u2019s backyard, but they aren\u2019t here. I make my way around the side of his house and see Will standing in the driveway, staring inside his car. When he sees me running toward him, his finger goes up to his mouth, instructing me to be quiet. I peer into the backseat where Kel and Caulder are both crouched in the floorboard, their fingers and hands clamped together in the shape of guns; they're both passed out.</p><p>I breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cThey would make horrible guards,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they sure would.\u201d</p><p>We both stand there, staring at our little brothers. Will's arm goes around me and he gives my shoulders a quick squeeze. His hug doesn't linger at all though, so I know it's nothing more than a gesture expressing relief that our brothers are safe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Hey, before you wake them up, I've got something of yours inside.\" He walks toward his house so I follow him inside and into the kitchen.</p><p>My heart is still pounding against my chest, although I can't distinguish if it's the aftermath of the search for our brothers, or if it's just being in Will's presence.</p><p>He pulls something out of his satchel and hands it to me. \"Your keys\" he says as he drops them into my hand.</p><p>\"Oh, thanks,\" I say, somewhat disappointed. I don\u2019t know what I expected him to have but I was fantasizing that maybe it was his resignation letter.</p> <p>\"It's running fine now. You should be able to drive it home tomorrow.\" He makes his way to his couch and sits.</p><p>\"What? You fixed it?\" I say.</p><p>\"Well, I didn't fix it. I know a guy who was able to put an alternator on it this afternoon.\"</p><p>His comparison in the parking lot comes back to mind. Somehow I doubt he would have an alternator put on any other student's vehicle.</p><p>\"Will, you didn't have to do that,\" I say as I sit beside him on the couch. \"Thanks though. I'll pay you back.\"</p> <p>\"Don't worry about it. You guys have helped me a lot with Caulder lately, it's the least I can do.\"</p><p>And yet again, I'm at a loss for what to say next. It feels like that first day I was standing in his kitchen, contemplating my next move after he helped me with my bandage. I know I should get up and leave, but I like being here next to him. Even if I am finding myself in his debt again. I finally find the confidence to speak again.</p><p>\"So, can we finish our conversation from earlier?\"</p><p>He adjusts himself in the couch and props his feet on the coffee table in front of us. \"That depends,\" he says. \"Did you come up with a solution?\"</p><p>\"Well, no,\" I reply, just as a possible solution comes to mind. I lean my head against the back of the couch and meekly suggest my idea.</p><p>\"Suppose these feelings we have just get more... complex.\" I pause for a moment. I'm not sure how he's going to take this new suggestion of mine, so I tread lightly.</p> <p>\"I wouldn't be opposed to the idea of getting a G.E.D.\"</p><p>\"That's ridiculous,\" he says, eyeing me sharply. \"Don't even think like that. There's no way you\u2019re quitting school, Lake.\"</p><p>I'm Lake again.</p><p>\"It was just an idea,\" I say.</p><p>\"Well, it was a dumb one.\u201d</p><p>We both think silently, neither of us coming up with any other solutions. My head is still resting against the back of the couch as I watch him. His arms are crossed behind his head as he stares up at the ceiling. His jaw is clenched tight and he's absentmindedly popping his knuckles.</p><p>He's no longer wearing the clothes he wears as a teacher. Instead, he has a plain white fitted t-shirt on and grey jogging pants that are almost identical to the ones I'm wearing. For the first time tonight, I notice his hair is wet. I haven't been this close to him in weeks; I was beginning to forget what he smells like. I inhale as I take in the scent of his aftershave. It smells like the air in Texas right before it starts to rain. If thunder had a smell, I imagine Will would smell just like it.</p><p>There's a small dab of shaving cream right below his left ear. My hand instinctively moves up to his neck as I wipe it away. He flinches and turns toward me and I defensively hold up my finger as if to prove my reason for touching him. He pulls my hand toward him as he rubs my finger across his shirt, wiping off the excess shaving cream.</p> <p>Our hands come to rest on his chest as we continue to look at each other in silence. My palm is flat against his heart and I can feel it rapidly beating against my hand. I know this exchange between us is wrong, but it feels incredibly right.</p><p>He allows my hand to remain on his chest as it moves up and down to the rhythm of his breath. The look in his eyes is the exact look he had when he was watching me in class today. Although this time, my physical response is more intense and I struggle to control the powerful urge to lean in and kiss him. I\u2019ve wanted to talk to him like this for over a month now. I still had so much to say before he started pretending I didn\u2019t exist. I\u2019m afraid as soon as I walk out of his house tonight, the isolation will return. I decide to tell him what I\u2019ve wanted to say to him for weeks.</p><p>\"Will?\" I whisper. \"I'll wait for you-until I graduate.\"</p><p>He exhales and closes his eyes as he strokes his thumb across the back of my hand. \"That's a long wait, Lake. A lot can happen in a year.\" His pulse increases against my palm.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what comes over me, but I lean closer and turn his face toward mine. I just need him to look at me.</p><p>He doesn't meet my gaze. Instead, his eyes focus on his hand as he slowly moves it up my arm. All the same sensations that flowed through me the first night we kissed come flooding back. I've missed his touch so much.</p><p>I watch him as he moves his hand to my shoulder. He slides his fingers underneath the strap of my shirt as he traces along the edges. His movements are slow and methodical as he pulls his legs off of the table in front of him and turns his body toward me. His expression seems full of conflict as he slowly leans in and presses his lips against my shoulder. I wrap my arms around him as I inhale. His breath becomes heavier as his lips move across my shoulder and onto my neck. The room starts to spin, so I close my eyes. His lips make their way to my jaw and closer to my mouth. When I feel him pull away I open my eyes again and he's watching me. There's a slight moment of hesitation in his eyes just before his lips close over mine.</p><p>In the past, his kisses have been very delicate and smooth. There is a different hunger behind him now as he slides his hands under my shirt and grasps at my waist. I return his kisses with the same feverish passion. I run my hands through his hair and pull him to me as I lay back on the couch. As soon as he begins to ease his body on top of mine, his lips break away and he sits back up.</p><p>\"We've got to stop,\" he says. \"We can't do this.\" He squeezes his eyes shut and rests his head against the couch.</p><p>I sit back up and ignore his protest as I slide my hands up his neck and through his hair. I press my lips to his and pull myself onto his lap. His hands wrap around my waist and he pulls me into him as he returns my kiss with even more intensity than before. He\u2019s right; they do get better every time.</p><p>My hands find the bottom edge of his shirt and I slide it up. Our lips separate for a brief moment as his shirt passes between us. I place my hands on his chest and run them over the contours of his muscles as we continue to kiss. His hands grip my arms and he pushes me down onto the couch. I'm waiting for him to find his way back to my mouth, but instead he pushes away from me and stands up.</p><p>\"Layken, get up!\" He demands as he grabs my hand and pulls me up from the couch.</p><p>I stand up, still caught up in the moment and unable to catch my breath.</p><p>\"This\u2014this can't happen!\" He\u2019s attempting to catch his breath too. \"I'm your teacher now. Everything has changed, we can't do this.\u201d</p><p>His timing sucks. My knees are weak so I sit back down on the couch for support. \"Will, I won\u2019t say anything. I swear.\" I don't want him to regret what just happened between us. For a moment, it felt like we were back where we belonged. Now, seconds later I'm confused again.</p><p>\"I'm sorry, Layken but it's not right,\u201d he says as he paces the floor. \u201cThis isn't good for either of us. This isn't good for you.\"</p><p>\"You don't know what's good for me,\" I snap. I'm getting defensive again.</p><p>He stops pacing and turns toward me. \"You won't wait for me. I won't let you give up what should be the best year of your life. I had to grow up way too fast, I'm not taking that away from you, too. It's not fair. I don\u2019t want you to wait for me, Layken.\"</p><p>The shift in his demeanor and the way my entire first name is flowing from his mouth is causing the oxygen to deplete from the room. I\u2019m dizzy.</p><p>\"I won't be giving anything up,\" I reply weakly. I would have screamed it if I could muster enough energy.</p><p>He grabs his shirt and pulls it on over his head as he moves further away from me. He walks to the opposite side of the living room and grips the back of the couch, his head falling between his shoulders.</p><p>\"My life is nothing but responsibilities. I'm raising a child for Christ\u2019s sake. I wouldn't be able to put your needs first. Hell, I wouldn't even be able to put them second. You deserve better than third.\"</p><p>I stand up and walk over to him, kneeling on the couch in front of him. I place my hands on top of his. \"Your responsibilities should come before me, which is why I want to wait for you, Will. You're a good person. This thing about you that you think is your flaw-it's the reason I'm falling in love with you.\"</p><p>My last few words trickle out as though I've lost what little control over myself I had left. I don't regret saying it, though.</p><p>He pulls his hands out from under mine and places them firmly on either side of my face. He looks me directly in the eyes. \"You are not falling in love with me.\" He says this as if it's a command. \u201cYou cannot fall in love with me.\u201d His face is hard as he clenches his jaw again. I feel the tears begin to well in my eyes as he releases me and walks toward the front door.</p><p>\"What happened tonight-\" He's pointing to the couch as he speaks. \"That can't happen again. That won't happen again.\" He says this as though he's trying to convince more than just me.</p><p>After he walks outside, he slams the door behind him and I'm left alone in his living room. My hands clutch at my stomach as the nausea intensifies. I'm afraid if I don't regain my composure soon, I won't be able to stand long enough to make it out of the house. I inhale through my nose and exhale from my mouth as I count backwards from ten.</p><p>It's a coping technique I learned when I was younger from my father. I used to have what my parent\u2019s referred to as \"emotional overloads.\" My dad would wrap his arms around me and squeeze me as tight as he could as we counted down. Sometimes I would fake the tantrums just so he would have to squeeze me. What I wouldn't give for my dad's embrace right now.</p><p>The front door opens and Will re-enters carrying a sleeping Caulder in his arms. \"Kel woke up, he's walking home now. You should go too,\" he says quietly.</p><p>I feel completely embarrassed. Embarrassed of what just happened between us and the fact that he is making me feel desperate; weaker than him. I snatch my keys off the coffee table and turn toward the door, stopping in front of him.</p><p>\u201cYou're an asshole,\u201d I say. I turn and leave, slamming the door behind me.</p><p>As soon as I get to my bedroom, I collapse on the bed and cry. Although it's negative, I finally have inspiration for my poem. I grab a pen and simultaneously start writing as I wipe away smudged tears off of the paper.</p><p>7.</p><p>\"You can\u2019t be like me</p><p>But be happy that you can\u2019t</p><p>I see pain but I don\u2019t feel it</p><p>I am like the old Tin Man.\u201d</p><p>-The Avett Brothers, Tin Man</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>According to Elizabeth Kubler Ross, there are five stages of grief a person passes through after the death of a loved one: Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.</p><p>I took a psychology class during the last semester of my junior year when we lived in Texas. We were discussing stage four when the principal walked into the room, pale as a ghost. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Layken, can I see you in the hallway please?\"</p><p>Principal Bass was a pleasant man. Plump in the belly, plump in the hands, plump in places you didn't know could be plump. It was an unusually cold spring day in Texas, but you wouldn't know it from the rings of sweat underneath his arms. He was the type of principal that hung out in his office rather than the halls. He never went looking for trouble, just waited for it to come to him. So why was he here?</p><p>I had a sinking feeling deep in the pit of my stomach as I stood up and walked as slow as I could to the classroom door. He wouldn't make eye contact with me. I remember I looked right at him and his eyes darted to the floor. He felt sorry for me. But why?</p><p>When I walked out into the hallway my mother was standing there, mascara streaked down her cheeks. The look in her eyes told me why she was there. Why she was there, and my father wasn't.</p> <p>\"How?\" I remember crying. She threw her arms around me and started to collapse to the floor. Rather than hold her up, I simply melted with her. That day we experienced our first stage of grief in the hallway floor of my High School: Denial.</p><p>Gavin is preparing to perform his poetry. He's standing in front of the class, his paper shaking between his fingers as he clears his throat to read from it.</p><p>I wonder, as I ignore Gavin's presence and focus on Will, do the five stages of grief only apply to the death of a loved one? Could it not also apply to the death of an aspect of your life? If it does, then I'm definitely smack dab in the center of stage two: Anger.</p><p>\"What's it called, Gavin?\" Will asks. He's sitting at his desk, writing notes into his pad as students perform. It pisses me off-the way he's being so attentive, focused on everything except me. His ability to make me feel like this huge invisible void pisses me off. The way he pauses to chew on the tip of his pen pisses me off. Just last night, those same lips that are wrapped around the tip of his ugly red pen were making their way up my neck.</p><p>I push the thought of his kiss out of my mind as quickly as it crept in. I don't know how long it will take, but I'm determined to break from this hold he has on me.</p> <p>\"Um, I didn't really give it a title,\" Gavin responds. He's standing at the front of the classroom, second to last person to perform. \"I guess you can call it Pre-Proposal?\"</p><p>\"Pre-Proposal, go ahead then,\" Will states in a teacher-ish voice that also pisses me off.</p><p>\"Eh-hem,\" Gavin clears his throat. His hands start trembling more as he begins to read.</p><p>One million, fifty one thousand and two hundred minutes.</p><p>That's approximately how many minutes I've loved you,</p><p>It's how many minutes I've thought about you,</p> <p>How many minutes I've worried about you,</p><p>How many minutes I've thanked God for you,</p><p>How many minutes I've thanked every deity in the Universe for you.</p><p>One million</p><p>Fifty one thousand</p><p>And</p><p>Two</p><p>Hundred</p> <p>Minutes...</p><p>One million, fifty one thousand and two hundred times.</p><p>It's how many times you've made me smile,</p><p>How many times you\u2019ve made me dream,</p><p>How many times you\u2019ve made me believe,</p><p>How many times you\u2019ve made me discover,</p><p>How many times you\u2019ve made me adore,</p><p>How many times you\u2019ve made me cherish,</p><p>My life.</p><p>(Gavin walks toward the back of the room where Eddie is sitting. He bends down on one knee in front of her as he reads the last line of his poem.)</p><p>And exactly one million, fifty one thousand and two hundred minutes from now, I'm going to propose to you, and ask that you share all the rest of the minutes of your life with me.</p><p>Eddie is beaming as she leans down and hugs him. The classroom is divided as the boys groan and the girls swoon. I simply squirm in my seat, anticipating the last poet of the day: Me.</p><p>\u201cThanks Gavin, you can take your seat. Good job.\u201d Will doesn't look up from his notes as he calls me to read my poem. His voice is soft, full of trepidation as he says my name. \"Layken, it\u2019s your turn.\"</p><p>I'm ready. I feel good about my piece. It's short but to the point. I already have it memorized so I leave the poem on my desk as I walk to the front of the classroom.</p><p>\"I have a question.\" My heart is racing as I realize this is the first time I've spoken out loud to Will in his classroom since I entered it a month ago. He hesitates as though he can't decide if he should acknowledge that I even have a question. He gives me a slight nod.</p><p>\"What if it doesn\u2019t rhyme?\u201d I say.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what he thought I was about to ask, but he looks relieved that this was my question.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Remember, there are no rules.\u201d His voice cracks slightly as he replies. I can see on his face that what happened between us last night is fresh on his mind. All the better.</p><p>\"Good. Okay then,\" I stammer. \"My poem is called mean.\" I face the front of the classroom and proudly recite my poem from heart.</p><p>According to the thesaurus...</p><p>and according to me...</p><p>there are over thirty different meanings and substitutions for the word</p><p>mean.</p><p>(I quickly yell the following words; the entire class flinches-including Will)</p><p>Jackass, jerk, cruel, dickhead, unkind, harsh, wicked, hateful, heartless, vicious, virulent, unrelenting, tyrannical, malevolent, atrocious, bastard, barbarous, bitter, brutal, callous, degenerate, brutish, depraved, evil, fierce, hard, implacable, rancorous, pernicious, inhumane, monstrous, merciless, inexorable.</p><p>And my personal favorite\u2014asshole.</p><p>I glance at Will as I return to my seat and his face is red, his teeth clenched. Eddie is the first to clap, followed by the rest of the girls in the class. I fold my arms across my chest and focus my eyes solely on my desk.</p><p>\"Man,\" Javi says. \u201cWho pissed you off?\u201d</p><p>The bell rings and the students begin to file out. Will never utters a word. I begin to pack my things into my bag when Eddie runs up to me as most of the class has filed out.</p><p>\"Have you talked to your mom yet?\" she asks.</p><p>\"My mom? About what?\"</p><p>I have no clue what she's referring to.</p><p>\"The date. Nick asked you out yesterday? You said you'd have to ask your mom?\"</p><p>\"Oh, that,\" I respond.</p><p>That was yesterday? It seems like a lifetime ago. I shoot a quick glance in Will's direction and see that he\u2019s watching me, waiting for my response to Eddie. His expression is stone cold. I wish at this moment he was easier to read. I assume his internal expression is jealousy, so I go with it.</p><p>\"Yeah, sure. Tell Nick I'd love to,\" I lie as I keep my eyes locked on Will. He grabs his pen and paper and opens one of the desk drawers and drops them in, slamming it shut. The action startles Eddie and she jumps, spinning around to look at him. He\u2019s aware of the attention he brought upon himself so he stands up and acts oblivious to us as he starts erasing chalk off the board. Eddie turns back toward me.</p><p>\"Great! Oh, and we decided on Thursday so after Getty\u2019s we can go to the slam. We've only got a few weeks, might as well get it out of the way. You want us to pick you up?\"</p><p>\"Uh, sure.\"</p><p>Eddie claps excitedly as she bounces out of the room. Will continues to erase away nothing as I start toward the exit.</p><p>\"Layken,\" Will says with a hardness to his voice.</p><p>I pause at the door but don\u2019t turn toward him.</p><p>\"Your mom works Thursday nights. I always get a sitter for Thursday's since I have to go to the slams. Just send Kel over before you leave. You know, before your date.\"</p><p>I don't respond. I simply walk out.</p><p>Lunch is awkward. Eddie has already informed Nick that I've agreed to go out with them, so everyone is extremely chatty about our new plans. Everyone except me. Other than the occasional nod and mutters of agreement, I don't speak. I have no appetite, so Nick eats the majority of my food. I stir the rice pudding around on my tray with my spoon, dribbling in traces of ketchup here and there. It reminds me of the remnants of the murdered snowman in my driveway. For days, every time I would back out, my tire would glide over his ice-hard body. I wonder if that's how quiet my jeep would be if I were to run over Will? Just accidentally back up over him, then put my car in drive and continue on.</p><p>\"Layken, are you just going to ignore him?\" Eddie says.</p><p>I look up to see Will standing behind Nick, staring down at the mess I've made of my tray.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\" I say to Eddie.</p><p>\"Mr. Cooper needs to see you,\" she says, nudging her head in Will's direction.</p><p>\"I bet you're in trouble for saying asshole,\" Nick says.</p><p>I put my hand against my throat, afraid it's about to explode. What is he doing? Why is he asking me to go with him in front of everyone? Has he lost his mind?</p><p>I slide my chair back and leave my tray on the table as I eye him cautiously. He walks out of the cafeteria toward his classroom, and I follow him. It's a long walk. A long, awkward, tension filled, quiet walk.</p><p>\"We need to talk,\" he says as he shuts his door behind us. \"Now.\"</p><p>I don't know if he's being 'Will' right now. I don't understand the angle he's coming at me from. I don't know whether or not to obey him, or punch him. I don't walk very far into his room. I fold my arms across my chest and attempt to look annoyed.</p><p>\u201cThen talk!\" I snap.</p><p>\"Dammit, Lake! I'm not your enemy. Stop hating me.\"</p><p>He's being Will.</p><p>I rush toward him and throw my hands up in the air in frustration. \"Stop hating you? Make up your freaking mind Will! Last night, you told me to stop loving you, now you're telling me to stop hating you? You tell me you don't want me to wait on you, yet you act like an immature little boy when I agree to go out with Nick! You want me to act like I don't know you, but then you pull me out of the lunchroom in front of everyone! We've got this whole fa\u00e7ade between us, like we're different people all the time and it's exhausting! I never know when you're Will or Mr. Cooper and I really don't know when I'm supposed to be Layken or Lake.\"</p><p>I'm tired of playing his head games. I'm so tired.</p><p>I throw myself into the desk I occupy during his class. He is hard to read as he stands there, expressionless. His hands are in his pockets and he's leaning against the chalkboard.</p><p>He slowly walks around me and takes a seat in the desk behind me. I continue to face forward as I feel him lean forward in the desk, close enough to whisper. My body tenses and my chest tightens when he speaks.</p><p>\"I didn't think it would be this hard,\" he says quietly.</p><p>I don't want to give him the gratification of seeing the tears that are making their way down my cheeks.</p><p>\"I'm sorry I said that to you earlier, about Thursday,\" he says. \"I was being sincere-for the most part. I know you'll need someone to watch Kel and I did make the slam a required assignment. But I shouldn't have reacted like that. That's why I asked you to come here, I just needed to apologize. It won't happen again, I swear.\"</p><p>The door to the classroom swings open and Will hops up out of the seat as Eddie eyes us curiously from the doorway. She's holding the backpack that I left in the cafeteria. I can't conceal the tears that are still flowing from my eyes so I turn away from her. There's nothing Will nor I could do at this point to mask the tension between us.</p><p>Eddie holds her palms up and gently lays my backpack on the desk closest to the door. She backs out of the room as she whispers, \"My bad...continue.\" She closes the door behind her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"That\u2019s just great,\" Will mutters.</p><p>\"Let it go, Will,\" I say as I stand up and walk to my backpack. \"If she asks me about it, I'll just tell her you were upset because I said asshole. And jackass. And dickhead. And bastar-\"</p><p>\"I get your point!\" he snaps.</p><p>My hand is on the doorknob when he calls my name again. I pause.</p> <p>\"I also want to say I'm sorry-about last night,\" he says.</p><p>I turn toward him as I speak. \"Are you sorry you let it happen? Or sorry about the way you stopped it?\"</p><p>He cocks his head and shrugs his shoulders as if he doesn't understand my question. \"All of it. It never should have happened.\u201d</p><p>\"Bastard,\" I finish.</p><p>The engine of my jeep purrs its' familiar sound when I crank it, and that pisses me off too. I slam my fist against the steering wheel, wishing so many things. I wish I never would have met Will the first week I was here. It would have been so much easier if I'd have met him in class first. Or better yet, I wish we never would have even moved to Ypsilanti. I wish my dad were alive. I wish my mother wasn't being so vague about her errands. I wish Caulder wasn't at our house every day. Seeing him just makes me think of Will. I wish Will would never have fixed my jeep. I hate that he does considerate things like that. It would make it so much easier to hate him if he really was all those things I called him. Oh my god, I can't believe I called him all those names. Wait, no regrets.</p> <p>I pick the boys up from school and drive home. I beat Will home today, but I won\u2019t be waiting at the window. I\u2019m done waiting at the window.</p><p>\"We'll be at Caulder's,\" Kel yells as they slam the jeep door.</p><p>Good.</p><p>When I walk inside, I hear my mother talking to someone in her bedroom. I pause outside her door. It's a one-sided conversation so she must be on the phone. Normally, I would never eavesdrop on one of her conversations. However, her behavior lately warrants a little nosiness. Or maybe my behavior warrants a little rebellion. Either way, I cup my ear to the door.</p><p>\"I know. I know. I'll tell them soon,\" she whispers.</p><p>\"No, I think it will go over better if I tell them alone...\"</p> <p>\"Of course I will. I love you too, Babe.\"</p><p>She's signing off. I quietly tiptoe to my bedroom and slip inside. I shut the door behind me and slide to the floor.</p><p>Seven months now. It took her all of seven months to move on. She can't be seeing someone else already, but her words on the phone couldn't have been more clear. I'm in stage one again: Denial.</p><p>How could she? And whoever he is, he already wants her to introduce us to him? I already don't like him. And her nerve! How could she accost Will like she did, when what she's doing is just as deplorable, if not worse? Stage one is extremely brief. I'm back in stage two again: Anger.</p><p>I decide not to bring it up right away. I want to find out more before I confront her about it. I want the upper hand in this situation, and it's going to take some thought.</p><p>\"Lake? Are you back?\" She's knocking on my door. I have to roll forward and hop up to get out of the way when she opens it. She sees me stand and her eyebrows raise as she watches me jump up.</p><p>\"What are you doing?\" she asks.</p><p>\"Stretching. My back hurts.\"</p> <p>She doesn't buy it, so I clasp my hands behind me and stretch my arms upward, bending forward.</p><p>\"Take some aspirin,\" she says.</p><p>\"Okay.\"</p><p>\"I'm off tonight, but I have a lot of sleep to catch up on. I didn't get any at all today so I'm going to lie down. Can you make sure Kel gets a bath before he goes to bed tonight?\"</p><p>\"Sure.\"</p><p>We both start down the hallway. \"Wait, Mom?\"</p><p>She turns back to me, her lids dragging over her bloodshot eyes.</p><p>\"I'm going out Thursday night. Is that okay?\"</p><p>She eyes me suspiciously. \"With who?\"</p><p>\"Eddie, Gavin and Nick.\"</p><p>\"Three guys? You aren't going anywhere with three guys.\"</p><p>\"No. Eddie's a girl. She's my friend. Her boyfriend is Gavin and we\u2019re double dating. I'm going with Nick.\"</p><p>Her eyes brighten a little. \"Oh. Well, good.\" She smiles as she opens the door to her bedroom. \"Wait,\" she says. \"I work Thursday. What about Kel?\"</p><p>\"Will has a sitter on Thursdays. He already said Kel could stay there.\"</p><p>She looks pleased, but only for a second. \"Will agreed to pay a sitter? To watch Kel? So you could go on a date?\"</p><p>Crap. I didn't realize how this would look. \"Mom, it's been weeks. We went on one date, we're over it.\"</p><p>She eyes me curiously. \"Hmm.\" She returns to her room, still unappeased.</p><p>Her suspicion brings me a small sense of gratification. She thinks I'm lying about something. Now we're even.</p><p>\"I'm not going to third period,\" I say to Eddie as we exit history.</p><p>\"Why not?\"</p><p>\"I just don't feel like it. Headache. I think I'll go sit in the courtyard and get some fresh air.\"</p><p>She shrugs as we start to part ways in the hallway.</p><p>\"Layken.\" She grabs my arm. \"Does it have anything to do with what happened at lunch? With Mr. Cooper? Is everything okay?\"</p><p>I smile at her reassuringly. \"No, it's fine. Mr. Cooper just wants me to refrain from my colorful choice of words in his class.\"</p><p>She purses her lips together and walks away with the same unappeased look my mother had last night.</p><p>The courtyard is empty. I guess none of the other students need a breather from the teacher they're secretly in love with. I sit at a bench and pull my phone out of my pocket. Nothing. I've only spoken to Kerris once since I moved. She was the one friend in Texas I was closest to, but she was actually best friends with another girl. It's odd when your best friend has an even better best friend. I chalked it up to the fact that I was too busy for best friends, but maybe it was more than that. Maybe I'm not a good listener. Maybe I'm not a good sharer.</p><p>\"Mind if I join you?\"</p><p>I look up as Eddie takes a seat on the bench across from me. \"Misery loves company,\" I say.</p><p>\"Misery? And why are we miserable? You have a date to look forward to tomorrow night. And your best friend is me,\" she says.</p><p>Best friend. Maybe. Hopefully.</p><p>\"You don't think Will is going to come looking for us?\" I say.</p><p>She cocks her head at me. \"Will? You mean Mr. Cooper?\"</p><p>Oh god, I just called him Will. She's already suspicious. I smile and come up with the first excuse that pops into my head.</p><p>\"Yeah, Mr. Cooper. We called teachers by their first names at my last school.\"</p><p>She doesn't respond. She's picking at the paint on the bench with her blue fingernail. Nine of her fingernails are green, just the one is blue. \"I'm just going to say something here,\" she says. Her voice is calmer. \"Maybe I'm way off base, maybe I'm not. But whatever I say, I don't want you to interject.\"</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\"I think what was happening at lunch yesterday was more than just a slap on the wrist for inappropriate verb usage. I don't know how much more, and honestly it's none of my business. I just want you to know you can talk to me. If you need to. I'd never repeat anything, I don't have anyone besides Gavin to repeat stuff to.\"</p><p>\"No one? Best friends? Siblings?\" I hope this changes the subject.</p><p>\"Nope. He's all I have,\" she says. \"Well, technically. If you want to know the truth, I've had seventeen sisters, twelve brothers, six moms and seven dads.\"</p><p>I can't tell if she's making a joke, so I don't laugh in case she isn't.</p><p>\"Foster care,\" she says. \"I'm on my seventh home in nine years.\"</p><p>\"Oh. I'm sorry.\" I don't know what else to say.</p><p>\"Don't be. I've been with Joel for four of those nine years. He's my foster dad. It works. I'm content. He gets his check.\"</p><p>\"Were any of your twenty-nine sibling\u2019s blood related?\"</p><p>She laughs. \"Man, you pay attention. And no, I'm an only child. Born to a mother with a yearn for cheap crack and pricey babies.\"</p><p>She can see I'm not following.</p><p>\"She tried to sell me. Don't worry, nobody wanted me. Or she was just asking too much. When I was nine she offered me to a lady in a Wal-Mart parking lot. She gave her a sob story about how she couldn't take care of me, yada yada, offered the lady a deal. A hundred bucks was my going rate. It wasn\u2019t the first time she tried this right in front of me. I was getting bored with it, so I looked right at the lady and said, 'You got a husband? I bet he\u2019s hot!' My mother backhanded me for ruining the sale. Left me in the parking lot. The lady took me to the police station and dropped me off. That's the last time I ever saw my mom.\"</p><p>\"God, Eddie. That's unreal.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, it is. But it's my real.\"</p><p>I lie down on the bench and look up at the sky. She does the same.</p><p>\"You said Eddie was a family name,\u201d I say. \u201cWhich family?\"</p><p>\"Don't laugh.\"</p><p>\"But what if I think it's funny?\"</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \"There was a comedy DVD my first foster family owned. Eddie Izzard. I thought I had his nose. I watched that DVD a million times, pretending he was my dad. I had people refer to me as Eddie after that. I tried Izzard for a while, but it never stuck.\"</p><p>We both laugh. I pull my jacket off and pull it on top of me, sliding my arms through it backwards so that it warms the parts of me that have been exposed to the cold for too long. I close my eyes.</p><p>\"I had amazing parents,\" I sigh.</p><p>\"Had?\"</p><p>\"My dad died seven months ago. My mother moved us up here, claimed it was for financial reasons, but I'm not so sure she was being honest now. She's seeing someone else already. So yes, amazing is past tense at the moment.\"</p><p>\"Suck.\"</p><p>We both lie there pondering the hands we were dealt. Mine pales in comparison to hers. The things she must have seen. Kel is the same age now that Eddie was when she was put into foster care. I don\u2019t know how she walks around so happy, so full of life. We're quiet. Everything is comfortably quiet. I silently wonder if this is what it feels like to have a best friend.</p><p>She sits up on her bench after a while, hands stretched out in front of her as she yawns. \u201cEarlier, the thing I said about Joel-and me being a check to him? It\u2019s not like that. He\u2019s really been a great guy. Sometimes when things get too real, my sarcasm takes over.\u201d</p><p>I smile at her in understanding. \"Thanks for skipping with me, I really needed it.\"</p><p>\"Thanks for needing it. Apparently, I did too. And about Nick? He\u2019s a good guy, just not for you. I\u2019ll drop it. But you still have to go with us tomorrow.\"</p><p>\u201cI know I do. If I don\u2019t, Chuck Norris will hunt me down and kick my ass.\u201d I flip my jacket around and ease my arms in as we walk through the door and back into the hallway.</p><p>\"So if Eddie is something you made up, what's your real name?\" I ask her before we part ways. She smiles and shrugs her shoulders.</p><p>\"Right now, it\u2019s Eddie.\u201d</p><p>8.</p><p>\u201cI wanna have friends</p><p>that will let me be</p><p>All alone when being alone</p><p>is all that I need.\u201d</p><p>-The Avett Brothers, The Perfect Space</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s mom?\u201d I ask Kel.

Said she would be back in a couple of hours. She wants you to order pizza.\u201d</p><p>If I\u2019d have been home a few minutes sooner, I would have followed her. \u201cDid she say where she was going?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cCan you ask them to put the pepperonis under the sauce this time?\u201d He asks.</p><p>\u201cWhere'd she say she was going?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, wait. Tell them to put the pepperonis on first, then the cheese, then the sauce on top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Kel! Where did she go?\u201d</p><p>His eyes grow wide as he climbs off the stool and walks backward toward the front door. He slumps his shoulders as he slips his shoes on. I've never cussed at him before.</p><p>\u201cKnow don\u2019t I. Caulder\u2019s to going I\u2019m.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe back by six, I\u2019ll have your pizza.\u201d</p> <p>I decide to knock my homework out first. Mr. Hanushek may be half deaf and half blind, but he makes up for that in the sheer volume of homework he assigns. I finish within an hour. It\u2019s just four-thirty.</p><p>I take this opportunity to play detective. Whatever she\u2019s up to and whoever she\u2019s with, I\u2019m determined to find out. I rummage through kitchen drawers, cabinets, hallway closets. Nothing. I\u2019ve never snooped in my parent\u2019s room before. Ever. This is definitely a year of firsts though, so I let myself in and close the door behind me.</p><p>Everything is the same as it was in their old bedroom. Same furniture, same beige carpet. If it wasn\u2019t for the lack of space, I would hardly be able to tell the difference between this room and the one she shared with my father. I check the obvious first; the underwear drawer. I don\u2019t find anything. I move to the edge of the bed and slide open the drawer to her nightstand. Eye mask, pen, lotion, book, note-</p><p>Note.</p><p>I slip it out of the drawer and open it. It\u2019s written in black ink, centered down the page. It\u2019s a poem.</p><p>Julia,</p> <p>I\u2019ll paint you a world one day</p><p>A world where smiles don\u2019t fade</p><p>A world where laughter is played</p><p>In the background</p><p>Like a P.S.A.</p><p>I\u2019ll paint it when the sun goes down</p><p>While you\u2019re lying there in your gown</p><p>The moment your smile turns around</p> <p>I\u2019ll paint right over your frown</p><p>I\u2019ll be finished when the sun breaks in</p><p>You\u2019ll wake with a still-wet grin</p><p>You\u2019ll see that I finish what I begin</p><p>The world I\u2019ve painted on your chin...</p><p>It\u2019s pathetic. The world I\u2019ve painted on your chin? Like a P.S.A.? What is that, anyway? Public service announcement? Who rhymes with acronyms? Whoever he is, I don\u2019t like him. I hate him. I fold the note up and put it back in its place.</p><p>I call Getty\u2019s and order two pizzas. Mom is pulling up in the driveway when I hang up the phone. Perfect opportunity for a shower. I lock myself in the bathroom before she makes it inside. I don\u2019t want to see the look on her face. That look of \u2018falling in love.'</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d my mother says when she opens up the box of pizza.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Kel\u2019s. It\u2019s backwards,\u201d I tell her. She rolls her eyes as she pulls the second box toward her. It makes me cringe how her eyes scroll over all the slices of pizza like she\u2019s trying to find the one that tastes the best. They\u2019re all slices from the same pizza!</p><p>\u201cJust pick one!\u201d I snap.</p><p>She flinches. \u201cJeez, Lake. Have you eaten today? Quite the crab, are we?\u201d She picks up a slice and thrusts it toward me. I throw it on my plate and plop down at the bar just as Kel comes running in backwards.</p><p>\u201cHere pizza the is?\u201d he asks, just as he trips over the rug and lands on his butt.</p><p>\u201cGod Kel, grow up!\u201d I snap.</p><p>My mother shoots me a look. \u201cLake! What is your problem? Is there something you need to talk about?\u201d</p><p>I push my pizza across the table and get up from the bar. I can\u2019t pretend anymore.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mother! There\u2019s nothing I need to talk about. I don\u2019t keep secrets!\u201d</p><p>She sucks in a small gasp of air. This is it-she knows I know.</p><p>I expect her to defend herself, yell at me, put up a fight, send me to my room. Something. Isn\u2019t that what happens when things come to fruition? The climax?</p><p>Instead, she simply looks away and grabs a plate for Kel, filling it with slices of backward pizza.</p><p>I march to my room and slam the door. Again. Who knows how many doors I\u2019ve slammed since we moved here. I\u2019m constantly leaving or entering rooms pissed off at someone. Will slams poems, I slam doors.</p><p>The alarm clock is flashing red when I wake up. The power must have gone out overnight. The sun is unusually bright for this early in the morning so I grab my phone to check the time and sure enough, we slept in. I jump out of bed and throw on my clothes, brush my teeth and pull my hair on top of my head. No time for makeup. I wake Kel up and rush him to get dressed as I gather my homework. No time for coffee either.</p><p>\u201cBut I ride to school with Caulder in the mornings,\u201d Kel whines as we pull our jackets on.</p><p>\u201cNot today. We slept in.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s apparent we aren\u2019t the only ones who slept in when I see Will\u2019s car still in his driveway. Great! I can\u2019t just leave and not wake them up.</p><p>\u201cKel, go knock on their door and wake them up.\u201d</p><p>Kel runs across the street and beats on the door as I climb inside my jeep and crank it. I turn the heater up full blast and grab the scraper and start wiping the frost away from the windows. I get the final window cleared when Kel returns.</p><p>\u201cNo one answered the door. I think they\u2019re still asleep.\u201d</p><p>Ugh! I hand the scraper to Kel and tell him to get inside the jeep as I walk to Will\u2019s house. Kel already tried the front door so I walk to the side of the house that the bedrooms are on. I don\u2019t know which one is Will\u2019s, so I knock on all three windows just to be sure I wake someone up.</p><p>As I round the front of the house, the front door swings open and Will is standing there, shielding his eyes from the sun, shirtless. My hands have touched those abs before. I force myself to look away.</p><p>\u201cPower went out. We slept in,\u201d I tell him. \u2018We\u2019 feels odd. It\u2019s like I\u2019m insinuating we\u2019re a team.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he says groggily as he rubs his face. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost eight.\u201d</p><p>He immediately perks up.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d he says as he remembers something. \u201cI\u2019ve got a conference at eight!\u201d</p><p>He turns back inside but leaves the door open. I peek my head further inside but don\u2019t dare step over the threshold.</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to take Caulder to school?\u201d I yell after him.</p><p>He reappears from the hallway.</p><p>\u201cWould you? Can you? You don\u2019t mind?\u201d He\u2019s really frantic. He\u2019s got a tie around his neck, but still no shirt.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind. Which one is his room? I\u2019ll get him ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yeah. That would be great. Thanks. First one on the left. Thank you.\u201d He disappears down the hallway again.</p><p>I go to Caulder\u2019s room and shake him awake. \u201cCaulder I\u2019m taking you to school. You need to get dressed.\u201d</p><p>I assist Caulder while he gets ready, catching glimpses of Will running back and forth. The front door eventually shuts, followed by a car door. He\u2019s gone. I\u2019m in his house. Awkward.</p><p>\u201cReady, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Food. Let me see.\u201d I rummage through cabinets in Will\u2019s kitchen. The canned goods are stacked according to their labels. There\u2019s an abundance of pasta. It\u2019s easy enough to cook I guess. Everything\u2019s so clean. Not like most twenty-one year old guys. I locate some pop tarts above the fridge and grab one for both Kel and Caulder.</p><p>I\u2019m half an hour late for first period so I decide to sit it out in my jeep. That\u2019s two classes in two days. I\u2019m becoming a real rebel.</p><p>I take my seat in history and Eddie swings in behind me.</p><p>\u201cYou skip math and you don\u2019t take me with you?\u201d she whispers from behind me.</p><p>I turn around and she draws her neck in and pouts.</p><p>\u201cOh. You slept in.\u201d</p><p>Makeup. I forgot to bring my makeup. Eddie reaches into her purse and pulls out a cosmetic bag. She can read my mind. Isn\u2019t that what best friends do?</p><p>\u201cMy hero,\u201d I say as I take it from her and turn around. I pull lipstick and mascara out, along with a mirror. I apply it quickly and hand her the bag back.</p><p>As we walk into third period, Will makes eye contact with me as he mouths, \u201cthank you.\u201d I smile and shrug my shoulders, letting him know it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Eddie pinches my arm as she walks past me, letting me know she saw our exchange.</p><p>You wouldn\u2019t know by looking at him that Will got ready in less than three minutes. His black pants are wrinkle-free, his white shirt tucked in at the waist. His tie...oh my god, his tie. I let out a laugh and he glances in my direction. He must not have noticed he put his tie on first this morning; it\u2019s barely visible underneath his white shirt. I tug at the collar of my shirt and point to him. He glances down and pats his chest where his tie should be. He laughs as he turns and faces the chalkboard and corrects his wardrobe malfunction. The other students were still taking their seats and chatting, but I know Eddie saw what just happened. I can feel her staring a hole into my back.</p><p>Nick throws himself into the seat next to me at lunch. Eddie is sitting right across from me. I expect her to give me the eye but she doesn\u2019t, she\u2019s just as exuberant as ever. She already knows too much. I\u2019m afraid she may assume it\u2019s more than it is. I was late for school today; Will obviously got dressed in a hurry. She has every right to bombard me with questions but she doesn\u2019t. I respect her for that-for respecting me.</p><p>\u201cNew Girl, what time we leavin\u2019?\u201d Nick asks as he\u2019s piling his food together.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Who\u2019s driving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive,\u201d Gavin says.</p><p>Nick looks up at Gavin. \u201cNo way, man. We\u2019re taking my dad\u2019s car. No way I\u2019m riding in Monte Car-no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonte Car-no?\u201d I look at Gavin.</p><p>\u201cMy car,\u201d Gavin replies.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your address Layken?\u201d Eddie asks. I\u2019m shocked she failed to obtain it the first time we met.</p><p>\u201cOh I know where she lives,\u201d Nick says. \u201cI gave her a ride home. Same street as Mr. Cooper. We\u2019ll pick her up last.\u201d</p><p>How does Nick know that? I flush as I glance down to my tray and stir my mashed potatoes, attempting to seem oblivious to Eddie\u2019s stare.</p><p>Nick and Gavin are both sitting in the front seat so I take the backseat with Eddie. When I climb in she smiles a friendly smile. She\u2019s not going to press me. I breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cLayken, we need your help,\u201d Gavin says. \u201cSettle something for us will ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like disputes. Shoot,\u201d I say as I put on my seatbelt.</p><p>\u201cNick here thinks Texas is nothing but tornadoes. He says they don\u2019t have hurricanes because there\u2019s no beach. School him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s wrong on both counts,\u201d I say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t be,\u201d Nick says.</p><p>\u201cThere are hurricanes,\" I say. \"You forgot about the little area known as The Gulf of Mexico.

Chuck Norris just hates trailer parks.\u201d</p><p>There is a moment of silence before they break out in laughter. Eddie scoots closer to me in the backseat and cups her hand to my ear.</p><p>\u201cHe knows.\u201d</p><p>I hold my breath, thinking back on conversations that might give me a clue who she\u2019s talking about.</p><p>\u201cWho knows? And what does he know?\u201d I finally ask.</p> <p>\u201cNick. He knows you aren\u2019t interested. He's fine with it. There\u2019s no pressure. We\u2019re just friends tonight, all of us.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m relieved. So relieved. I was already planning out how I would let him down.</p><p>I never did get to taste the pizza from Getty\u2019s that I had delivered last night. It\u2019s heaven. We had to order two, since Nick is eating a whole one by himself. I haven\u2019t thought about being mad at my mother so far. I haven\u2019t even thought about Will, (that much). I\u2019m having fun. It\u2019s nice.</p><p>\u201cGavin, what\u2019s the stupidest thing you\u2019ve ever done?\u201d Nick asks.</p><p>We all quiet down at this question.</p><p>\u201cI can only pick one?\u201d Gavin asks.</p> <p>\u201cThe one. The stupidest one,\u201d Nick replies.</p><p>\u201cHmm. I guess it would have to be the time I was visiting my grandparents on their ranch right outside of Laramie, Wyoming. I had to use the bathroom so bad. It\u2019s not a big deal, I\u2019m a guy. We can whip it out anywhere. The big deal was that it was my turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cTo complete the dare. My brothers used to dare me to do stuff all the time. They would do it first, and then I\u2019d have to do it. The only problem was, I was younger by several years so they always outsmarted me somehow. This particular day, they told me my rubber boots were too wet to wear so I had to throw on my hiking boots. They, of course, wore their rubber boots. Well, they came up with the dare to see who would pee on the electric fence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d Eddie laughs.</p><p>\u201cOh, just wait, Babe. It gets better. They went first, which I realize now that rubber absorbs electricity, so they didn\u2019t feel anything. I, on the other hand, was not so lucky. It knocked me on my back and I was crying, trying to get up when I tripped. I fell forward and met the fence with my mouth. Saliva and electricity don\u2019t mix well either. It shocked me so bad my tongue started to swell and my brothers freaked out. Both of them ran home to get my parents while I lay there, unable to move with my dick hanging out of my pants.\u201d</p><p>Eddie, Nick and I are all laughing so hard we get glares from the other customers. Eddie wipes away a tear when Gavin tells her it\u2019s her turn.</p><p>\u201cI guess when I ran over you with my car,\u201d Eddie says.</p> <p>\u201cTry again,\u201d Gavin says.</p><p>\u201cWhat? That\u2019s it! That\u2019s the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about after you ran over me? Tell them about that,\u201d he laughs.</p><p>\u201cWe fell in love. The end.\u201d She\u2019s obviously embarrassed by the aftermath of the swipe.</p><p>\u201cYou have to tell us now,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cFine. It was the second day after I got my license. Joel let me drive his car to school so I was being super careful. I was focused. When Joel was teaching me to drive, he paid careful attention to how I parked. He hates people who double park. In fact, I knew he was going to have someone drive him through the parking lot just to double check my parking job, so I really wanted to be perfect. So, that\u2019s what I was focused on. I didn\u2019t like how I parked the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr the second, third or fourth time,\u201d Gavin says.</p><p>Eddie smirks at him. \u201cSo on the fifth time, I was determined to get it right. I backed out extra far to get a better angle and that\u2019s when it happened. The thud. I turned around and didn\u2019t see anyone so I panicked, thinking I had hit the car next to me or something. I continued to back out of the spot and threw the car in drive and was looking for a better spot so that I could inspect the car for damage. I pulled over in the next lot and got out. That\u2019s when I saw him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...drug him?\u201d I ask. I\u2019m trying to hold back the laughter.</p><p>\u201cOver 200 yards. After I hit him the first time, I kept backing up and his pant leg got hung up in the bumper. I broke his leg. Joel was so worried they were going to sue, he made me take food to him at the hospital every day for a week. That\u2019s when we fell in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t kill him,\u201d Nick says. \u201cYou\u2019d be locked up on a hit and run charge and involuntary manslaughter. Poor Gavin would be ten feet under.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix feet under!\u201d I laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to hear your stupid story Layken, but it\u2019s gonna have to wait. We\u2019re gonna be late,\u201d Eddie says as she scoots out of the booth.</p><p>On our drive to the slam, Eddie pulls a folded up sheet of paper out of her back pocket.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my poem. I\u2019m going to slam tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? God you're brave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. The first time Gavin and I went, I promised myself I would do one before I turned eighteen. My birthday is next week. When Mr. Cooper told us we could skip the final if we performed, I took it as a sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would just say I did one, Mr. Cooper won\u2019t know. I doubt he\u2019ll be there,\u201d Nick says.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gavin says. \u201cHe\u2019ll be there. He\u2019s always there.\u201d</p><p>The empty feeling in my stomach returns, despite being full from supper. I slide my hands across my pants and fix my eyes on a star outside the window. I\u2019ll wait to join back in the conversation until the subject changes.</p><p>\u201cMan, Vaughn really did a number on him,\u201d Nick says.</p><p>I cock my head in Nick\u2019s direction. Eddie sees the interest perk in me and she folds her paper up and puts it back in her pocket.</p><p>\u201cHis ex,\u201d she says. \u201cThey dated their last two years of high school. They were the couple. Homecoming queen, football star...\"</p><p>\u201cFootball? He played football?\u201d I\u2019m shocked. This doesn\u2019t sound like Will.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, star quarterback three years running,\u201d Nick says. \u201cWe were freshmen when he was a senior. He was a nice guy, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say the same about Vaughn,\u201d Gavin says.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Was she a bitch?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, she wasn\u2019t that bad in high school. It\u2019s what she did to him after they graduated. After his parents...\u201d Eddie\u2019s voice trails off.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d she do?\u201d I sound too interested, I know.</p><p>\u201cShe dumped him. Two weeks after his parents were killed in a car wreck. He had a football scholarship but lost it when he had to move back home to take care of his little brother. Vaughn told everyone she wasn\u2019t marrying a college dropout with a kid. So, that\u2019s it. He lost his parents, his girlfriend, his scholarship and became a guardian all in the same two week time frame.\u201d</p><p>I return my gaze out the window. I don\u2019t want Eddie to see the tears welling up in my eyes. This explains so much. It explains why he\u2019s scared to take everything away from me, like it was taken from him. All this time I've been assuming his feelings just aren't as strong for me as mine are for him. Maybe I'm wrong. I fade out of the conversation as I become entranced with the falling snow as we drive toward Detroit.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Eddie whispers as she lays something in my lap. A tissue. I squeeze her hand to thank her, then wipe the tears from my eyes.</p><p>9.</p><p>\u201cA slight figure of speech</p><p>I cut my chest wide open</p><p>They come and watch us bleed</p><p>Is it art like I was hoping now?\u201d</p><p>-The Avett Brothers, Slight Figure of Speech</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>When we enter the building, I immediately search for Will. Nick and Gavin lead us to a table on the floor, so much more exposed than the booth Will and I sat in. The sac has already performed and they are well into round one. Eddie goes to the judges table and pays her money and comes back.</p><p>\u201cLayken, come to the bathroom with me,\u201d she says as she pulls me out of my chair.</p><p>When we get in the bathroom, she backs me up to the sink and stands in front of me with her hands on my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cSnap out of it girl! We\u2019re here to have fun.\u201d She reaches into her purse and pulls out her makeup bag. She wets her thumbs under the faucet and wipes mascara from underneath my eyes. She meticulously applies my makeup. She\u2019s extremely focused on the task. No one\u2019s ever done my makeup before besides me. She pulls a brush out of her purse and pushes me forward, brushing my hair upside down over my head. I feel like a ragdoll. She pulls me back up and does some fancy handiwork as her fingers twist and pull at my hair. She steps back and smiles as though she\u2019s admiring her accomplishment.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>She turns me to the mirror and my jaw drops to the floor. I can\u2019t believe it. I look...pretty. My bangs are pulled into a French braid that hangs loose down my shoulder. The soft amber hue of eye shadow brings out my eyes. My lips are defined but not too colorful. I look just like my mother.</p><p>\u201cWow. You have a gift, Eddie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Twenty-nine brothers and sisters in nine years, you\u2019re bound to learn a few tricks.\u201d</p><p>She pulls me out of the bathroom and we head back. As we approach our seats, I stop. Eddie stops too, since she has hold of my hand and is suddenly being jerked back. She follows my gaze to our table and sees Javi...and Will.</p><p>\u201cLooks like we have company,\u201d she says as she winks at me. She tries to pull me forward but I pull her hand back. My feet are weighted to the floor beneath me.</p><p>\u201cEddie, it\u2019s not like that. I don\u2019t want you thinking it\u2019s like that.\u201d</p><p>She turns and faces me and takes my hands in hers.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anything, Layken. But, if it really isn\u2019t like that, it would explain the obvious tension between you two,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only obvious to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s how it shall remain,\u201d she says as she pulls me forward.</p><p>When we reach the table, all eight eyes are focused on me. I want to run.</p><p>\u201cDamn girl, you look good,\u201d Javi says.</p><p>Gavin glares at Javi and then smiles back at me. \u201cEddie got hold of you, did she?\u201d He wraps his arm around Eddie\u2019s waist and pulls her to him, leaving me to fend for myself.</p><p>Nick pulls a chair out for me and I take it. I glance up at Will and he gives me a half smile. I know what it means. He thinks I look pretty.</p><p>\u201cAlright we\u2019ve got four more performers for round one. Next one goes by the name of Eddie. Where is he?\u201d</p><p>I look at Eddie as she rolls her eyes and stands. \u201cI\u2019m a she!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my bad. There she is. Come on up Ms. Eddie,\u201d</p><p>Eddie gives Gavin a quick peck on the lips and bounces to the stage, her confidence pouring from her smile. Everyone takes a seat other than Will. Javi takes the seat to my left and the only available seat at the table is to my right. Will hesitates before he takes a step and finally sits. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you performing Eddie?\u201d the emcee asks her.</p><p>She leans into the microphone and says, \u201cPink Balloon.\"</p><p>As soon as the emcee is off the stage, Eddie loses her smile and goes into her zone.</p><p>My name is Olivia King</p> <p>I am five years old.</p><p>My mother bought me a balloon. I remember the day she walked through the front door with it. The curly hot pink ribbon trickling down her arm, wrapped around her wrist. She was smiling at me as she untied the ribbon and wrapped it around my hand.</p><p>\u201cHere Livie, I bought this for you.\u201d</p><p>She called me Livie.</p><p>I was so happy. I\u2019d never had a balloon before. I mean, I always saw balloons wrapped around other kids wrists in the parking lot of Wal-Mart, but I never dreamed I would have my very own.</p> <p>My very own pink balloon.</p><p>I was so excited! So ecstatic! So thrilled! I couldn\u2019t believe my mother bought me something! She\u2019d never bought me anything before! I played with it for hours. It was full of helium and it danced and swayed and floated as I drug it around from room to room with me, thinking of places to take it. Thinking of places the balloon had never been before. I took it in the bathroom, the closet, the laundry room, the kitchen, the living room. I wanted my new best friend to see everything I saw! I took it to my mother\u2019s bedroom!</p><p>My mothers</p><p>Bedroom?</p><p>Where I wasn\u2019t supposed to be?</p><p>With my pink</p> <p>I covered my ears as she screamed at me, wiping the evidence off of her nose! She slapped me across the face as she told me how bad I was! How much I misbehaved! How I never listened! She shoved me into the hallway and slammed the door, locking my pink balloon inside with her. I wanted him back! He was my best friend! Not hers! The pink ribbon was still tied around my wrist so I pulled and pulled, trying to get my new best friend away from her.</p><p>And</p><p>it</p><p>My name is Eddie.</p><p>I\u2019m seventeen years old.</p><p>My birthday is next week. I\u2019ll be the big One-Eight. My foster dad is buying me these boots I\u2019ve been wanting. I\u2019m sure my friends will take me out to eat. My boyfriend will buy me a gift, maybe even take me to a movie. I\u2019ll even get a nice little card from my foster care worker, wishing me a happy eighteenth birthday, informing me I\u2019ve aged out of the system.</p><p>I\u2019ll have a good time. I know I will.</p><p>But there\u2019s one thing I know</p> <p>for sure.</p><p>I better not get any</p><p>shitty ass pink balloons!</p><p>When the crowd cheers for her, Eddie eats it up. She\u2019s bouncing up and down on the stage and clapping along with the crowd, forgetting all about the somber poem she just performed. She\u2019s a natural. We give her a standing ovation as she comes back to the table.</p><p>\u201cThat felt so awesome,\u201d she squeals. Gavin throws his arms around her and picks her up off the ground and kisses her cheek.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d he says as they sit back down in their seats.</p><p>\u201cThat was great Eddie, guess you\u2019re exempt,\u201d Will says.</p><p>\u201cThat was so easy! Layken, you really need to do one next week. You\u2019ve never had one of Mr. Cooper\u2019s finals before. They aren\u2019t fun, believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d I say. She did make it look easy.</p><p>Will laughs and leans forward. \u201cEddie, you haven\u2019t had one of my finals either, I\u2019ve only been teaching two months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure they suck,\u201d she laughs.</p><p>They call another performer to the stage as the table grows quiet. Javi\u2019s leg keeps brushing against mine. Something about him gives me the creeps. Maybe it\u2019s the obvious creep factor. Throughout the performance, I keep drawing myself in more and more until I have nowhere else to go, but he somehow keeps getting closer. Just when I\u2019m on the verge of punching him, Will moves in and whispers in my ear.</p><p>\u201cTrade me seats.\u201d</p><p>I hop up and he slides over as I take his seat. I silently thank him with a look. Javi straightens back up and glares over at Will. It\u2019s obvious there is no love lost between the two of them.</p><p>By the start of the second round, everyone at our table is dispersing amongst the crowd. I spot Nick at the bar chatting up a girl. Javi eventually sulks off, leaving just Will and I at the table with Gavin and Eddie.</p><p>\"Mr. Cooper did you see-\"</p><p>\u201cGavin,\u201d Will interrupts him. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to call me \u2018Mr. Cooper\u2019 here. We went to high school together.\u201d</p><p>A mischievous grin crosses Gavin\u2019s face. He nudges Eddie and they both smile at Will. \u201cCan we call you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! You can\u2019t!\u201d Will interrupts again. He\u2019s blushing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m missing something here,\u201d I say as I look from Will to Gavin.</p><p>Gavin leans forward in his chair and puts his elbows on his knees. \u201cYou see Layken, about three years ago...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin, I\u2019ll fail you. I\u2019ll fail your little girlfriend too,\" Will says.</p><p>Everyone\u2019s laughing now, but I\u2019m still lost.</p><p>\u201cThree years ago, Duckie here decided to start a prank war with the freshmen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuckie?\u201d I say. I look at Will and his face is buried in his hands.</p><p>\u201cIt became apparent that Will, I mean \u2018Duckie\u2019, was the one behind all the pranks. We suffered at the hands of this man.\u201d Gavin laughs as he gestures toward Will.</p><p>\u201cSo, we decided we\u2019d had enough. We came up with a little plan of our own, now known as Duckie\u2019s revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Gavin. I knew it was you! I knew it,\u201d Will says.</p><p>Gavin laughs. \u201cWill was known for his daily naps in his car. Particularly during Mr. Hanushek\u2019s History class. So, we followed him to the parking lot one day and waited until he was off in la la land. We got about twenty five rolls of duct tape and wrapped him inside the car. There had to be six layers of duct tape around his car already before he finally woke up. We could hear him screaming and kicking at the door all the way back to the school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god. How long were you in there?\u201d I ask Will. I don\u2019t even hesitate when I speak to him. I like that we're interacting again, even if it is just as friends. This is good.</p><p>He cocks an eyebrow at me as he responds. \u201cNow that\u2019s the kicker. Mr. Hanushek\u2019s history class was second period. I wasn\u2019t cut out of the car until my dad called the school trying to find me. I don\u2019t remember what time it was, but it was dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in there almost twelve hours?\u201d</p><p>He nods.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you use the bathroom?\u201d Eddie asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never tell,\u201d he laughs.</p><p>We can do this. I watch Will as he interacts with Eddie and Gavin; they\u2019re all laughing. I didn\u2019t think it would be possible before-a friendship between us. But here, right now, I do.</p><p>Nick walks back up to the table with a sour look on his face. \u201cI don\u2019t feel so hot. Can we go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much did you eat Nick?\u201d Gavin says as he stands up.</p><p>Eddie looks at me and tilts her head to the front door, insinuating it\u2019s time to go. \u201cSee you tomorrow, Mr. Cooper,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about that Eddie?\" Will asks her. \"You and your friend here aren\u2019t taking another courtyard nap tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Eddie looks back at me and clasps her hand to her mouth as she exaggerates a gasp and laughs. Will and I stand up as they all file out.</p><p>\u201cJust leave Kel at my house tonight,\u201d he says after everyone is out of earshot. \u201cI\u2019ll get him to school tomorrow. They\u2019re probably asleep by now anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it's fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, thanks.\u201d</p><p>We both stand there, not certain how to part. He steps out of my way. \u201cSee ya tomorrow,\u201d he says. I smile and shuffle my way past him as I catch up to Eddie.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Mom? Please?\u201d Kel says.</p><p>\u201cKel, y\u2019all spent the night with each other last night. I\u2019m sure his brother wants some time with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Caulder says.</p><p>\u201cSee? We\u2019ll stay in our room. I swear,\u201d Kel says.</p><p>\u201cFine. But Caulder, I\u2019ll need you to be at your house tomorrow night. I\u2019m taking Lake and Kel to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am. I\u2019ll go tell my brother and get my clothes.\u201d</p><p>Kel and Caulder run out the front door. I squirm in my seat on the couch as I unzip my boots. This dinner she\u2019s referring to must be it; the big introduction. I decide to press her a little further.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going to dinner?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She comes to the couch and sits, grabbing the remote to flip on the TV.</p><p>\u201cWherever. Maybe we\u2019ll just eat here. I don\u2019t know. I just want some alone time, just the three of us.\u201d</p><p>I pull my boots off and snatch them up. \u201cThe three of us,\u201d I mumble as I walk to my room. I think about that as I throw my boots in my closet and lay on the bed. It used to be \"the four of us.\" Then it became \"the three of us.\" Now, in less than seven months, she\u2019s making it \"the four of us\" again.</p><p>Whoever he is, he will never be included in a count with Kel and I. She doesn\u2019t know I know about him. She doesn\u2019t even know I\u2019ve already labeled him and her as \"the two of them,\" and Kel and I as \"the two of us.\" Divide and conquer. That\u2019s my new family motto.</p><p>We\u2019ve been living in Ypsilanti for a month now and I\u2019ve spent every single Friday night in my room. I grab my phone and text Eddie, hoping her and Gavin won\u2019t mind a third wheel tonight on their movie date. She texts me back in a matter of seconds, giving me thirty minutes to get ready. It isn\u2019t enough time to thoroughly enjoy a shower, so I go to the bathroom and touch up my makeup. The mail is in a pile on the bathroom counter next to the sink, so I pick it up and look at it. All three envelopes have a big red post office stamp across them. Forward to new address is stamped over our old Texas address.</p><p>Eight more months. Eight more months and I\u2019m moving back home. I contemplate hanging a calendar on my wall so I can start marking down the days. I toss the envelopes back on the counter, when the contents of one of them falls to the floor. When I pick it up, I notice the numbers printed in the top right-hand corner.</p><p>$178,343.00</p><p>It\u2019s a bank statement. It\u2019s an account balance. I snatch up the rest of the mail as I run to my room and shut the door.</p><p>I look at the dates on the bank statement and then sort through the other envelopes. One of them is from a mortgage company so I tear it open. It\u2019s an insurance invoice. An invoice for our house back in Texas that I was told we sold. Oh my god, I want to kill her. We aren\u2019t broke! We didn\u2019t even sell our house! She tore my brother and I from the only home we\u2019ve ever known for some guy? I hate her. I have to get out of this house before I explode. I grab my phone and throw the envelopes in my purse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out,\u201d I say as I walk through the living room toward the front door.</p><p>\u201cWith who?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cEddie. Going to a movie.\u201d I keep my replies short and sweet so she won\u2019t see the fury behind my voice. My whole body is shaking I\u2019m so angry. I just want to get out of the house and process things before I confront her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She walks over to me and grabs my cell phone out of my hand and starts pressing buttons.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d I yell as I grab it back out of her grasp.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re up to, Lake! Don\u2019t pretend with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I up to? I\u2019d really like to know!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLast night you and Will were both gone. He conveniently had a babysitter. Tonight, his brother says he\u2019s spending the night and half an hour later you\u2019re going out? You aren\u2019t going anywhere!\u201d</p><p>I throw my phone in my purse and wrap my purse across my shoulder as I head to the front door.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact I am going out. With Eddie. You can watch me leave with Eddie. You can watch me return with Eddie.\u201d I walk out the front door and she follows me. Luckily, Eddie is pulling up in the driveway.</p><p>\u201cLake? Get back here! We need to talk,\u201d she yells from the doorway.</p><p>I open the door to Eddie\u2019s car and I turn to face her. \u201cYou\u2019re right mom, but I think you\u2019re the one that needs to do the talking. I know why we\u2019re having dinner tomorrow! I know why we moved to Michigan! I know about everything! So don\u2019t you dare talk to me about hiding stuff!\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t wait for her to respond as I get in the backseat and slam the door.</p><p>\u201cGet me out of here. Hurry,\u201d I say to Eddie.</p><p>I start crying as we drive away. I never want to go back.</p><p>\u201cHere, drink this.\u201d Eddie shoves another soda across the table as she and Gavin watch me drink-and cry. We stopped at Getty\u2019s because Eddie said their pizza was the only thing that could help me right now. I couldn\u2019t eat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I ruined your date,\u201d I say to both of them.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ruin it. Did she babe?\u201d Eddie says as she turns to Gavin.</p> <p>\u201cNot at all. It\u2019s a nice change of routine,\u201d he says as he shoves his pizza into a takeout box.</p><p>My phone is vibrating again. It\u2019s the sixth time my mother has called, so I hold down the power button and throw it back in my purse.</p><p>\u201cCan we still make it to the movie?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Gavin looks at his watch and nods. \u201cSure, if you really feel like going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I need to stop thinking about this for a little while.\u201d</p><p>We pay our bill and head to the theater. It\u2019s not Johnny Depp, but any actor will do right now.</p><p>10.</p><p>\u201cShe puts her hands against</p> <p>the life she had.</p><p>Living with ignorance,</p><p>Blissful and sad.</p><p>But nobody knows what lies behind</p><p>The days before the day we die.\u201d</p><p>-The Avett Brothers, Die Die Die</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>We pull up to my house a few hours later. I don\u2019t immediately get out of the car as I take a few deep breaths, preparing for the fight that\u2019s about to go down.</p><p>\u201cLayken, call me later. I wanna know everything. Good luck,\u201d Eddie says.</p><p>\u201cThanks, I will.\u201d I get out of the car and walk up to the door as they drive away. When I walk inside, my mom is lying on the couch. She hears the door close and jumps up. I expect her to continue yelling but she runs to me and throws her arms around my neck. I stand stiff.</p><p>\u201cLake, I\u2019m so sorry, I should have told you. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d She\u2019s crying.</p><p>I back apart from her and go sit on the couch. There\u2019s tissue paper all over both end tables. She\u2019s been crying a lot. Good, she should feel bad. Awful, even.</p><p>\u201cDad and I were going to tell you before he-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad? You were seeing him before dad even died?\u201d I stand up and pace the floor. \u201cMom! How long has this been going on?\u201d I\u2019m yelling now. And crying again.</p><p>I look at her, waiting for her to defend her repulsive behavior but she is staring at the table in front of her.</p><p>She leans forward and cocks her head at me. \u201cSeeing who? What do you think\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who! Whoever wrote you that poem in your nightstand! Whoever you\u2019ve been going to see every time you run errands. Whoever you\u2019ve been saying I love you to on the phone. I don\u2019t know who and I really don\u2019t care who.\u201d</p><p>She walks to me and places her hands on my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cLake, I\u2019m not seeing anyone. You\u2019ve misunderstood everything. All of it.\u201d</p><p>I can tell she\u2019s being honest, but I still don\u2019t have any answers.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the note? And the bank statements? We aren\u2019t broke, Mom. And you never even sold the house! You lied to us to drag us up here. If it wasn\u2019t for some guy, then why? Why are we here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh god, Lake. I thought you knew. I thought you figured it out.\u201d She sits back down on the couch.</p><p>\u201cApparently not,\" I say. I'm frustrated. I don't understand what could possibly be so important about Michigan that she would drag us away from our entire lives.</p><p>\"So tell me,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cSit down. Please, sit down.\u201d</p><p>I sit back down on the couch and wait for her to explain everything. She pauses for a long time as she gathers her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cThe note, it\u2019s just something your dad wrote. He was being silly. He drew on my face one night and left the note on my pillow. I kept it. I loved your dad, Lake. I miss him so much. I would never do anything like that to him. There\u2019s no one else.\u201d</p><p>She's being sincere.</p><p>\u201cThen why did we move here, Mom? Why did you make us move here?\u201d</p><p>She takes a deep breath and grabs my hands. The look in her eyes makes my heart sink. It\u2019s the same look she had in the hallway earlier this year when she came to tell me the news about my dad. She takes another deep breath and squeezes my hands.</p><p>\u201cLake, I have cancer.\u201d</p><p>Denial. I\u2019m definitely in denial. And anger. Bargaining? Yes, that too. I\u2019m in all three. All five, maybe. I can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cYour father and I were going to tell you. After he died, y\u2019all were so devastated. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to talk to you about it. When I started getting worse, I wanted to move back here. Brenda begged me to, said she\u2019d help take care of me. She\u2019s the one I\u2019ve been talking to on the phone. There\u2019s a doctor in Detroit that specializes in lung cancer. That\u2019s where I\u2019ve been going.\u201d</p><p>Lung cancer. It has a name. That makes it even more real.</p><p>\u201cI was going to tell you and Kel tomorrow. It\u2019s time you guys know, so we can all prepare.\u201d</p><p>I pull my hands away from her.</p><p>\u201cPrepare...for what, Mom?\u201d</p><p>She wraps her arms around me and starts crying again. I push her back.</p><p>\u201cPrepare for what, Mom?\u201d</p><p>Just like plump Principal Bass, she can\u2019t look me in the eyes. She feels sorry for me.</p><p>I don\u2019t remember walking out of the house, and I don\u2019t remember going across the street. The only thing I know is that it\u2019s midnight and I\u2019m beating on Will\u2019s door.</p><p>When he opens it he doesn\u2019t ask any questions. He can see on my face that I just need him to be Will. Just for a little while. He puts his arm around me shoulders and ushers me inside as he shuts the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cLake, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t respond. I can\u2019t breathe. Will wraps his arms around me just as I start to collapse to the floor and cry. And just like in the school hallway with my mother, he melts to the floor with me. He puts my head under his chin as he rubs my hair and lets me cry.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d he finally whispers.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to say it. If I say it out loud, that means it\u2019s real. It is real.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dying, Will,\u201d I say between sobs. \u201cShe has cancer.\u201d He squeezes me tighter, then picks me up and carries me to his bedroom. He lays me on the bed and pulls the covers over me when the doorbell rings. He kisses me on the forehead as he leaves the room.</p><p>I can hear her speak when he answers the door, but I can\u2019t hear what she says. His voice is low but I'm able to make out what Will says.</p><p>\u201cLet her stay, Julia. She needs me right now.\u201d</p><p>A few more things are spoken that I can\u2019t make out. I hear him eventually shut the door and he comes back to the bedroom. He crawls into the bed, puts his arms around me and holds me while I cry.</p><p>Part Two</p><p>11.</p><p>\u201cWho cares about tomorrow?</p><p>What more is tomorrow,</p><p>Than another Day?\u201d</p><p>-The Avett Brothers, Swept Away</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>The window is on the wrong side of the room. What time is it? I throw my arm across the bed and reach for the phone on my nightstand. My phone\u2019s not there. Neither is the nightstand. I sit up in the bed and rub my eyes. This isn\u2019t my room. When it all comes flooding back to me, I lie back down and pull the blanket over my head, wishing it all away.</p><p>\u201cLake.\u201d</p><p>I wake up again. The sun isn\u2019t as bright, but it\u2019s still not my room. I pull the covers tighter over my head.</p><p>\u201cLake, wake up.\u201d</p><p>Someone is pulling the covers back off of my head. I groan and grip them even tighter. I try to wish it all away again, but my bladder is screaming at me. I throw the covers off and see Will sitting on the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou really aren\u2019t a morning person,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cBathroom. Where\u2019s your bathroom?\u201d</p><p>He points across the hall. I jump out of the bed and hope I can make it. I run to the toilet and sit, but nearly fall in. The seat\u2019s up.</p><p>\u201cBoys,\u201d I mutter as I let the seat down.</p><p>When I emerge from the bathroom, Will is at the bar in the kitchen. He smiles and scoots a cup of coffee to the empty seat next to him. I take the seat, and the coffee.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOne-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Your bed\u2019s really comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently,\u201d he smiles as he nudges my shoulder.</p><p>We drink our coffee in silence. Comfortable silence.</p><p>Will takes my empty cup to the sink and rinses it out before putting it in the dishwasher.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking Kel and Caulder to a matinee,\u201d he says as he turns on the dishwasher. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving in a few minutes. I\u2019ll probably take them to dinner afterwards, so we\u2019ll be back around six. Should give you and your mom time to talk.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t like how he throws that last sentence in there, like I\u2019m susceptible to his manipulation.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to talk? What if I want to go to a matinee?\u201d</p><p>He lays his elbows on the bar and leans toward me.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to watch a movie. You need to talk to your mom. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He grabs his keys and jacket and starts walking toward the door. I lean back in my chair and fold my arms across my chest.</p><p>\u201cI just woke up. The caffeine hasn\u2019t even kicked in yet. Can I stay here for a while?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m lying. I just want him to leave so I can crawl back into his comfortable bed.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He walks toward me and bends down as he kisses the top of my head. \u201cBut not all day. You need to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>He puts his jacket on and walks out, shutting the door behind him. I walk to the window and watch as Kel and Caulder climb in the car and they all drive away.</p><p>I look across the street at my house. My house that\u2019s not a home. I know my mom is inside, just yards away. I have no idea what I would begin to say to her if I walked over there right now. I decide not to go right away. I don\u2019t like that I\u2019m so mad at her. I know this isn\u2019t her fault, but I don\u2019t know who else to blame. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I notice someone grinning at me. It's just the gnome. The gnome with a broken red hat and his ugly little smirk. It's like he knows. He knows I'm over here, too scared to go over there. He's taunting me. Just as I'm about to shut the curtain and let him win, I notice someone pull up in our driveway. Eddie.</p><p>I open the front door to Will\u2019s house and wave as she gets out of her car. \u201cEddie, I\u2019m over here!\u201d She looks at me, back toward my house, then back at me with a confused look across her face before she crosses the street.</p><p>Great. Why did I just do that? How am I going to explain this?</p><p>I step aside and hold the door open for her as she enters, eyeing the living room curiously.</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay? I\u2019ve called you a hundred times!\u201d she says as she plops down on the sofa. She props her foot up on the coffee table and starts removing her boots. \u201cWhose house is this?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have to answer her. The family portrait hanging on the wall in front of her answers for me.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says. That\u2019s all she says about it, though.</p><p>\u201cWell? What happened? Did she tell you who he is? Do you know him?\u201d</p><p>I walk to the couch, step over her legs and take the seat next to her.</p> <p>\u201cEddie? Are you ready to hear my version of the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever done?\u201d</p><p>She raises her eyebrows and waits for me to spill it.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong. She\u2019s not seeing anyone, she\u2019s sick. She has cancer.\u201d</p><p>Eddie places her boots beside her and brings her feet back up to the coffee table as she leans back against the couch. She has two completely different socks on.</p><p>\u201cMan, that\u2019s unreal,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is. But it\u2019s my real.\u201d</p> <p>She sits there for a moment, picking at her black fingernails. I can tell she doesn\u2019t really know what to say. Instead of saying anything, she just leans across the couch and hugs me, right before she bounces up.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s Mr. Cooper got to drink around here?\u201d She walks to the kitchen and opens the refrigerator. She grabs two glasses and fills them with ice and brings them back to the living room where she fills them with soda.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t find any wine. He\u2019s such a bore,\u201d she says as she hands me my drink. \u201cSo, what\u2019s her prognosis?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I left right after she told me last night. It doesn't sound good, though. I haven\u2019t been able to face her.\u201d</p><p>I turn my head toward the window and look at our house again. I know it\u2019s inevitable. I know I\u2019ll have to face her; I just want one more day of normalcy.</p><p>\u201cLayken, you need to go talk to her.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cGod, you sound just like Will.\u201d</p><p>She takes a sip of her drink and returns it to the coffee table. \u201cSpeaking of Will.\u201d</p> <p>Here we go.</p><p>\u201cLayken, I\u2019m trying so hard to mind my business. I really am. But you\u2019re in his house! You\u2019re wearing the same clothes I dropped you off in last night. If you don\u2019t at least deny there\u2019s something going on, then I\u2019ll have to assume you\u2019re admitting it.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. She\u2019s right. From her standpoint, it seems like more is going on than there really is. I don\u2019t have a choice but to be honest with her or she\u2019ll assume the worst of him.</p><p>\u201cFine. But Eddie, you have to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear. Not even to Gavin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Well, I met him the first day we moved here. There was something there, between both of us. He asked me out, we went out. We had a great time. We kissed. It was probably the best night of my life. It was the best night of my life.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s smiling now. I hesitate before I continue. She can tell by my body language that it\u2019s not a happy ending and her smile fades.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know. Until my first day of school, I didn\u2019t know he was a teacher. He didn\u2019t know I was in high school.\u201d</p><p>She stands up. \u201cThe hallway! That\u2019s what was going on in the hallway!\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cOh my god. So he ended it?\u201d</p><p>I nod again. She falls back onto the couch.</p><p>\u201cShit. That sucks.\u201d</p><p>I nod again.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re here. You spent the night,\u201d she grins. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t hold back could he?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that. I was upset so he let me stay here. Nothing happened. He\u2019s just being a friend.\u201d</p><p>She slumps her shoulders and pouts, making it obvious she was hoping we caved.</p><p>\u201cJust one more question. Your poem. It was about him, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d she laughs.</p><p>She\u2019s quiet again, but not for long. \u201cLast question. I swear. For real.\u201d</p><p>I look at her, letting her know it's okay to continue.</p><p>\u201cIs he a good kisser?\u201d</p><p>I smile. I can't help but smile. \u201cOh my god, he\u2019s so freakin' hot!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d She claps her hands and bounces on the couch.</p><p>Our laughter fades as the reality of the moment returns. I turn and look out the window again and gaze at our house across the street while she takes our glasses to the sink. As she\u2019s walking back through the living room, she grabs my hand and pulls me off the couch.</p><p>\u201cCome on, we\u2019re going to talk to your mom.\u201d</p><p>We? I don\u2019t object. There\u2019s something about Eddie that you just don\u2019t object to.</p><p>12.</p><p>\u201cWith paranoia on my heels</p><p>Will you love me still</p><p>When we awake and you see that</p><p>The sanity has gone from my eyes?\u201d</p><p>-The Avett Brothers, Paranoia in B Flat Major</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Eddie has never been inside my house before. You wouldn't know that by watching her bounce through the front door. She's still pulling me along behind her when we walk inside. My mother is sitting on the sofa, watching this stranger scamper toward her with a smile on her face, dragging her angry daughter behind her. I have to admit, the surprise on my mom's face is gratifying.</p><p>Eddie pulls me to the couch and pushes my shoulders down until I'm seated next to my mother. Eddie proceeds to take a seat on the coffee table directly in front of us, posture straight, head held high. She is in charge.</p><p>\"I'm Eddie, your daughter's best friend,\" she says to my mother. \"There, now that we all know each other, let's get down to the nitty gritty.\"</p><p>My mother looks at me, then back at Eddie and doesn\u2019t respond. I actually have nothing to say either. I don't know where Eddie is taking this so all I can do is allow her to continue.</p><p>\"Julia, right? That's your name?\"</p><p>My mother nods.</p><p>\"Julia, Layken has questions. Lots of questions. You have answers.\" Eddie looks at me. \"Layken, you ask questions and your mother will answer them.\" She looks at both of us simultaneously. \"That's how you do it. Any questions? For me, I mean?\"</p><p>My mother and I both shake our heads. Eddie stands up. \"Alright then. My work here is done. Call me later.\"</p><p>Eddie steps over the coffee table and heads for the front door, but spins on her feet and comes back to us. She wraps her arms around my mother's neck. My mother looks at me wide-eyed before she returns the hug. Eddie continues to squeeze my mother's neck for an unusually long time before she finally lets go. She smiles at us, hops over the coffee table and walks out the front door. And she's gone. Just like that.</p><p>We both sit in silence, staring at the front door-confused as to where exactly things went wrong with Eddie. Or where exactly they went right. It was hard to tell. I glance back at my mother and we both laugh.</p><p>\"Wow, Lake. You sure know how to pick 'em.\"</p><p>\"I know. She's great, huh?\"</p><p>We both settle into the couch and my mother reaches over and pats the top of my hand.</p><p>\"We better do what she says. Ask me a question, I'll answer it best I can.\"</p><p>I cut right to the chase. \"Are you gonna die?\"</p><p>\"Aren't we all?\" she replies.</p><p>\"That's a question. You're supposed to just answer.\"</p><p>She sighs, like she's hesitating, not really wanting to answer.</p><p>\"Possibly. Probably,\" she admits.</p><p>\"How long? How bad is it?\"</p><p>\"Lake, maybe I should explain it first. It'll give you a better idea of what we're up against.\"</p><p>She stands and moves to the kitchen and takes a seat at the bar. She motions for me to sit with her as she grabs a pen and a sheet of paper and starts to write something down.</p><p>\"There are two types of lung cancer. Non-small cell and small cell. Unfortunately, I have small cell, which spreads faster.\"</p><p>She is drawing a diagram. \"Small cell can either be limited or extensive.\" She points to an area on a sketched pair of lungs. \"Mine was limited. Which means it was contained into this area.\" She circles an area of the lungs and makes a pinpoint. \"This is where they found a tumor. I was having some symptoms a few months before your father died. He had me go in for a biopsy and that's when we found out it was malignant. We researched doctors for a few days and finally decided our best course of action would be a doctor we found here in Michigan-in Detroit. He specializes in SCLC. We decided on the move before your father even died. We-\"</p><p>\"Mom, slow down.\"</p><p>She lays down the pen.</p><p>\"I need a minute,\" I say. \"God, it feels like I'm in science class.\"</p><p>I rest my head in my hands. She's had months to think about this. She talks about it like she's teaching me how to bake a cake!</p><p>She patiently waits as I get up and go to the bathroom. I splash water on my face and stare at my reflection in the mirror. I look like complete crap. I haven't even glanced in a mirror since before I went out with Gavin and Eddie last night. My mascara is smudged under my eyes. My eyes are puffy. My hair is wild. I wipe the makeup off and brush out my hair before I go back to the kitchen and listen to her tell me how she's going to die.</p><p>She looks up at me as I walk back into the kitchen and I nod, giving her the go-ahead.</p><p>\"A week after we decided we were moving to Michigan to be closer to the Doctor, your father died. I was so consumed with it, with his death and the arrangements and everything. I just tried to push what was going on with me out of my mind. I didn't go back to the doctor for three months. By that time, it had spread. It was no longer limited small cell, it was extensive.\"</p><p>She looks away, ashamed. Her voice lowers. \"I blamed myself-for your dad's heart attack. I knew it was the stress of the diagnosis that caused it.\" She stands and walks to the living room and looks out the front window.</p><p>\"Why didn't you tell me? I could have helped you, Mom. You didn't need to deal with all of it on your own.\"</p><p>\"I know that now. I was in denial. I was angry. I was hoping for a miracle, I guess. I don't know. The days turned into weeks, then months. Now we're here. I started Chemotherapy again three weeks ago.\"</p><p>\"That's good, right? If they're giving you chemo then there's a chance it'll go away.\"</p><p>She shakes her head. \"It's not to fight it, Lake. It's to manage my pain. It's all they can do now.\"</p><p>I drop my head in my hands and cry. It's amazing how many tears one person can have. One night after my father died, I had cried so much I started to become paranoid I was doing damage to my eyes, so I googled it. I googled 'can a person cry too much?' Apparently, everyone eventually falls asleep and stops crying in order for their bodies to process normal periods of rest. So no, you can't cry too much. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I grab a tissue and take a few deep breaths in an attempt to hold back the rest of my tears. I'm really sick of crying.</p><p>I feel my mother's arms go around me so I turn into her and hug her. My heart aches for her. For us. She eventually starts coughing and has to turn away. I watch her as she continues to cough, gasping for breath. She's so sick. How did I not notice? Her cheeks were even shallower than before. Her hair is thinner. I hardly recognize her. I've been so focused on my own misery that I haven't even noticed my own mother being swept away right before my eyes.</p><p>The coughing spell passes and my mother returns to her seat at the bar. \"We'll tell Kel tonight. Brenda will be here at seven, she wants to be here since she'll be his guardian.\"</p><p>I laugh. Because she's joking. Right?</p> <p>\"What do you mean his guardian?\"</p><p>\"Lake. You're still in high school, soon you'll be in college. I don't expect you to give everything up. I don't want you to. Brenda has raised children before. She wants to do it. Kel likes her.\"</p><p>Of all the things I have been through this year. This moment, these words that have just come out of her mouth-I have never been more enraged.</p><p>I stand up and grip the back of the chair and throw it to the floor with such force that the seat comes loose from the base. She flinches as I sprint toward her, pointing my finger into her chest.</p><p>\"She is NOT getting Kel! You are not giving her MY brother!\" I scream so loud my throat burns.</p> <p>She attempts to subdue me by putting her hands on my shoulders but I spin away from her.</p><p>\"Lake, stop it! Stop this! You're still in high school! You haven't even started college yet, what do you expect me to do? We've got no one else,\" she walks after me as I head for the front door. \"I've got no one else, Lake,\" she cries.</p><p>I open the door and swing around to her, ignoring her tears as I continue to scream.</p><p>\"You aren't telling him tonight! He doesn\u2019t need to know yet. You better not tell him!\"</p><p>\"We have to tell him. He needs to know,\" she says. She's following me down the driveway now. I keep walking.</p><p>\"Go home, Mother! Just go home! I'm done talking about it! And if you ever want to see me again, you WILL NOT TELL HIM!\"</p> <p>I hear her sobs fade as I slam the door to Will's living room behind me. I run to his bedroom and throw myself on the bed. I don't just cry; I sob, I wail, I scream.</p><p>I've never used drugs before. If you don't count the sip of my mother's wine when I was fourteen, I've never even willingly had alcohol before. It's not that I was too afraid, or too straight laced. Honestly, I'd just never been offered anything. I never went to parties in Texas. I never spent the night with anyone who ever tried to coerce me into doing something illegal. I have frankly just never been in a situation where I could succumb to peer pressure. I spent my Friday nights at football games. Saturday nights my dad usually took us out to a movie and to dinner. Sunday I did homework. That was my life.</p><p>There was one exception when Kerris' cousin had a wedding and she invited me to go. I was sixteen, she just got her license and the reception had just ended. We stayed late to help clean up. We were having the best time. We drank punch, ate leftover cake, danced, drank more punch. We realized pretty quickly that someone had laced the punch when we both noticed how much fun we were having. I don't know how much of it we drank. Too much that we were already too drunk to stop when we noticed we were even drunk. We never even thought twice when we got in the car to go home. We got a mile down the road before she swerved and hit a tree. I got a laceration above my eye and she broke her arm. We both ended up being okay. In fact, the car was still drivable. Rather than do the smart thing and wait for help, we turned the car around and actually drove back to the reception to call my dad. The trouble we got into the next day is a different story.</p><p>But there was a moment, right before she hit the tree. We were laughing at the way she said 'bubble'. We just kept saying it over and over until the car started to glide off of the road. I saw the tree, and I knew we were about to hit it. But it was as if time slowed down. The tree could have been five million feet away. That's how long it took for the car to actually hit the tree. The only thing I thought about was Kel. The only thing. I didn't think about school, the boys, the college I would miss out on if I died. I thought about Kel, and how he was the only thing that was important to me. The only thing that mattered in the seconds before I thought I was about to die.</p><p>I somehow fell asleep in Will's bed again. I know this, because when I opened my eyes, I was no longer crying. See? People can't cry forever. Everyone eventually falls asleep.</p><p>I expect the tears to return once the fog clears from my mind, but instead I feel motivated, renewed. Like I'm on some sort of mission. I get out of bed and have an odd urge to clean. And sing. I need music. I head to the living room and immediately find what I'm looking for. The stereo. I don't even have to search for music when I turn it on, there's already an Avett Brothers c.d. inside. I crank up the volume to one of my favorites and get busy.</p><p>Unfortunately, Will's house is surprisingly clean for two male inhabitants, so I have to search hard for something to keep me busy. I hit the bathroom first, which is good. I know nine-year-olds don't have very good aim so I start scrubbing. I scrub the toilet, the floors, the shower, the sinks. It's clean.</p><p>I move on to the bedrooms where I organize, make beds, re-make beds. Next, I hit the living room where I dust and vacuum. I mop the bathroom floors and wipe down every surface I can find. I end up at the kitchen sink where I wash the only two dirty dishes in the house; mine and Eddie's glasses.</p> <p>It's almost seven when I hear Will's car pull up. He and the two boys walk in the house and come to a halt when they see me sitting in his living room floor.</p><p>\"What are you doing?\" Caulder asks.</p><p>\"Alphabetizing,\" I reply.</p><p>\"Alphabetizing what?\" Will says.</p><p>\"Everything. First I did the movies, then I did the c.d.'s. Caulder, I did the books in your room. I did a few of your games, but some of those started with numbers so I put the numbers first, then the titles.\" I point to the piles in front of me. \"These are recipes. I found them on top of the fridge. I'm alphabetizing them by category first; like beef, lamb, pork, poultry. Then behind the categories I'm alphabetizing them by-\"</p><p>\"Guys, go to Kel's. Let Julia know you're back,\" Will says as he continues to watch me.</p><p>The boys don't move. They just stare at the recipe cards in front of me.</p><p>\"Now!\" Will yells. They both jerk their eyes away and start back toward the door.</p><p>\"Your sister's weird,\" I hear Caulder say as they leave.</p><p>Will sits down on the couch in front of me as I continue to alphabetize the recipes.</p><p>\"You're the teacher,\" I say. \"Should I put 'Baked Potato Soup' behind potato, or soup?\"</p><p>\"Stop,\" he says. He seems moody.</p><p>\"I can't stop, silly. I'm halfway finished. If I stop now you won't know where to find...\" I grab a random card off the floor. \"Jerk Chicken?\" It would be that one. I throw the card back in the pile.</p><p>Will eyes the living room, then stands and walks into the kitchen. I see him run his finger along the baseboards. Good thing I thought about those. He walks down the hallway and returns a couple of minutes later.</p><p>\"You color coded my closet?\"</p><p>He's not smiling. I thought he would be happy.</p><p>\"Will, it wasn't that hard. You wear like, three different color shirts.\"</p><p>He glides across the living room and bends down; snatching up the recipe cards I've organized into piles.</p><p>\"Will! Stop! That took me a long time!\" I snatch them back out of his hands as fast as he's picking them up.</p><p>He finally throws them back in the floor and grabs my wrists and tries to pull me up, but I start kicking at his legs. \"Let me go! I'm...not...done!\"</p><p>He lets go of my hands and I fall back to the floor. I pick up the recipe cards and start re-organizing them back into piles. He completely took me back to square one. I can't even find the 'beef' card. I flip over two cards that are upside down but-</p><p>\"What the hell!\" I scream. I'm suddenly drenched in water.</p><p>I look up and Will is standing over me with an empty pitcher in his hand. I lunge forward and start punching at his legs. He backs away as I start hitting at him, trying to get off of the floor.</p><p>Why the hell did he just do that? I'm gonna punch him in the face. I stand up and try to hit him but he steps aside and grabs my arm and wraps it around my back. I'm flailing my other arm at him as he pushes me toward the hallway and into the bathroom. The next thing I know, his arms are around me and he lifts me up, pulls the shower curtain back and shoves me in. I'm still trying to punch him but his arms are longer than mine. He holds me against the wall with one arm while he turns the faucet on with the other. A stream of ice cold water splashes across my face. I gasp.</p><p>\"Jerk! Jackass! Asshole!\"</p><p>He continues to hold me back as he turns the other faucet on and the water turns warmer.</p><p>\"Take a shower, Layken! Take a damn shower!\" He lets go of me and slams the bathroom door.</p><p>I jump out of the shower; my clothes are drenched. I try to open the bathroom door but I can't because he's holding the doorknob from the other side.</p><p>\"Let me out, Will! Now!\" I'm beating on the door and trying to turn the doorknob but it doesn't budge.</p><p>\"Layken,\" he calmly responds from the other side of the door. \"I'm not letting you out of the bathroom until you take off your clothes, get in the shower, wash your hair, and calm down.\"</p><p>I flip him off. He can't see me of course, but it still feels good. I take off my wet clothes and throw them in the floor, hoping I get something dirty. I climb in the shower. The warm water feels good against my skin. I close my eyes and let the water trickle through my hair and down my face.</p><p>Dammit. Will is right again.</p><p>\"I need a towel!\" I yell. I've been in the shower well over half an hour. Will has a shower head with a jet setting. I turned it on and focused it on the back of my neck for the majority of the time. It really does relieve tension.</p><p>\"It's on the sink. So are your clothes,\" he yells from outside the bathroom.</p><p>I pull the curtain back and there is definitely a towel there. And clothes. My clothes. Clothes he obviously just got out of my house, and somehow put in the bathroom. While I was in the shower.</p><p>I turn the water off and step out of the shower and dry off. I twist the towel around my head and put on my clothes.</p><p>He brought me pajamas. Maybe that means I'm sleeping in his comfortable bed again. I hesitate as I turn the doorknob, assuming I still won't be able to open it, but it swings open.</p><p>When he hears me open the bathroom door, he jumps over the back of the couch and runs toward me. I back up to the wall, afraid he's about to shove me back in the bathroom when his arms go around my waist and he hugs me.</p><p>\"I'm sorry, Lake. I'm sorry I did that. You were just losing it.\"</p><p>I hug him back. Of course I hug him back. \"It's okay. I kinda sorta had a bad day,\u201d I say.</p><p>He pulls away from me and places his hands on my shoulders. \"So we're friends? You aren't going to try to punch me again?\"</p><p>\"Friends,\" I say reluctantly. That's the last thing I want to be to him right now. His friend. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"How was the matinee?\" I ask as we walk down the hallway.</p><p>\"Did you talk to your mom?\" He ignores my question.</p><p>\"Jeez. Deflect much?\"</p><p>\"Did you talk to her? Please don't tell me you spent the entire day cleaning.\" He enters the kitchen and pulls two glasses out of the cabinet.</p> <p>\"No. Not the entire day. We talked.\"</p><p>\"And?\"</p><p>\"And...she has cancer,\" I reply frankly.</p><p>He looks at me and scowls. I roll my eyes at him and put my elbows on the table, gripping my forehead with my hands. My fingers brush against the towel that's on my head. I bend away from the bar and pull the towel off and flip my head forward, brushing the tangled strands with my fingers to smooth them out.</p><p>After I remove all the tangles, I raise my head back up just as Will darts his eyes away from me and to the cup that's now overflowing in his hand with milk. I pretend not to notice the spill and continue to mess with my hair as he wipes up the milk with a rag.</p> <p>He pulls something out of the cabinet and gets a spoon out of the drawer. He's making me chocolate milk.</p><p>\"Will she be okay?\" he asks.</p><p>I sigh. He's relentless.</p><p>\"No. Probably not.\"</p><p>\"But she's getting treatment?\"</p><p>I've been able to go the entire day without thinking about it. I've been comfortably numb since I woke up from my nap. I know this is his house, but I'm beginning to wish he would leave again.</p> <p>\"She's dying, Will. Dying. She'll probably be dead within the year, maybe less than that. They're just doing chemo to keep her comfortable. While she dies. 'Cause she'll be dead. Because she's dying. There. Is that what you wanted to hear?\"</p><p>His expression softens as he sets the milk in front of me. He grabs a handful of ice out of the refrigerator and drops it into my cup.</p><p>\"On the rocks,\" he says.</p><p>He's good at deflecting, and even better at ignoring my snide remarks. \"Thanks,\" I say. I drink my chocolate milk and shut up. It feels like he somehow just won our fight.</p><p>The Avett Brothers are still strumming away in the background when I finish my chocolate milk. I walk to the living room and put the song on repeat. I lie on the floor and stare up at the ceiling with my hands stretched out above my head. It's relaxing.</p><p>\"Turn the lights off,\" I tell him. \"I just want to listen for a while.\"</p><p>He turns the lights off and I sense him lie down beside me on the floor. A dancing green glow from the sound waves on the stereo illuminate the walls as The Avett Brothers put on a color show.</p><p>My thoughts drift with the music as we lay there motionless. After the song ends and loops around again, I tell him what's really on my mind.</p> <p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want me to raise Kel. She wants to give him to Brenda.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the only thing spoken during the hour that we lay in the floor. He finds my hand in the dark and holds it. He holds it; and I let him just be my friend.</p><p>The lights flick on and I immediately cover my eyes. We\u2019re still lying in the middle of the floor. I sit up and see Will next to me, sound asleep.</p><p>\"Hey,\" Eddie whispers. \"I knocked, nobody answered.\u201d She walks through the front door and sits on the couch. She watches Will as he snores, sprawled out in the living room floor.</p><p>\u201cIt's Saturday night,\" she says as she rolls her eyes. \"Told you he was a bore.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChecking on you. You haven\u2019t answered your phone or texted me back at all today. Your mom has cancer so you decide to swear off technology? Doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where my phone is.\u201d</p><p>We both stare at Will for a moment. He's snoring really loud. The boys must have worn him out today.</p><p>\u201cSo, I assume things didn\u2019t go well with your mom? Since you\u2019re here, sleeping in the damn floor.\u201d She looks annoyed that we weren\u2019t doing anything more than just sleeping.</p><p>\u201cNo, we talked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>I get up and stretch before I sit on the sofa beside her. She\u2019s already got her boots off. I guess going so long without a permanent home makes you feel like you\u2019re at home anywhere you go. I pull my feet up and lay back on the arm of the couch, facing her.</p><p>\u201cLast week in the courtyard when you were telling me about your mom and what happened when you were nine-\"</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was grateful. I was so grateful that nothing like that would ever happen to Kel. I was grateful that he was able to live a normal nine-year-old life. But now-it's like God has it out for us. Why both of them? Wasn't my dad enough? It\u2019s like death came and punched us square in the face.\u201d</p><p>Eddie turns her gaze away from Will and looks at me.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t death that punched you, Layken. It was life. Life happens. Shit happens. And it happens a lot. To a lot of people.\"</p><p>I don\u2019t even bother with the worst of the details. I\u2019m too embarrassed to admit to her that my own mother doesn\u2019t even want me raising her child.</p><p>Will rustles in the floor.</p><p>Eddie leans over and gives me a squeeze and grabs her boots. \u201cTeacher's waking up, I better get outta here. I just wanted to check on you. Oh, and go find your phone,\u201d she says as she walks toward the door.</p><p>I watch her as she leaves. She\u2019s in a room for three minutes and her energy is infectious. I turn back around to see Will sitting up in the floor. He\u2019s looking at me like he\u2019s about to give me detention.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was she doing here?\u201d</p><p>He can be really intimidating when he wants to be.</p><p>\u201cVisiting,\u201d I mutter. \u201cChecking on me.\u201d If I don\u2019t make it sound like a big deal, maybe he won\u2019t either.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Layken!\u201d</p><p>Nope. He thinks it\u2019s a big deal.</p><p>He pushes himself up off the floor and throws his hands up in the air. \u201cAre you trying to get me fired? Are you that selfish that you don\u2019t give a crap about anyone else\u2019s problems? Do you know what would happen if she let it get out that you spent the night here?\u201d A light bulb goes off in his head and he takes a step toward me. \u201cDoes she know you spent the night here?\u201d</p><p>I press my lips into a tight, thin line and look down at my lap, avoiding his eyes.</p><p>\"Layken, what does she know?\" he says, his voice getting lower. He can see by my body language that I've told her everything.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Layken. Go home.\u201d</p><p>My mother is already in bed. Kel and Caulder are sitting on the couch watching TV.</p><p>\u201cCaulder, your brother wants you to go home. Kel and I have plans tomorrow, so we won't be home all day.\u201d</p><p>Caulder grabs his jacket and heads toward the front door.</p><p>\"See ya, Kel!\" He slips his shoes on and leaves.</p><p>I walk to the living room and throw myself into the seat beside Kel. I grab the remote and start flipping through channels, attempting to put the fact that I just pissed Will off out of my mind.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d Kel asks.</p><p>\u201cWith Eddie.\u201d</p><p>\"What were y'all doing?\"</p><p>\"Driving around.\"</p><p>\u201cWhy were you at Caulder\u2019s house when we got home from the movies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill paid me to clean his house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is Mom sad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause. She doesn\u2019t have enough money to pay me to clean her house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Our house isn\u2019t dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go ice skating tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\"Yes!\"</p><p>\u201cThen stop asking so many questions.\u201d</p><p>I press the power button on the remote and send Kel to bed.</p><p>When I climb into my own bed, I set the alarm for six o\u2019clock. I want to be out of this house before my mother wakes up.</p><p>Kel and I spend the entire day Sunday blowing every cent of my savings account. I took him to breakfast where we ordered two meals each off of the menu. We went ice skating and we both sucked at it so we didn't stay long. I took him to lunch at a concession stand inside an arcade where we stayed for four hours. After the arcade, I took him to an afternoon movie where we had dinner that consisted of even more concession stand food. I would have taken him for dessert, but he's now complaining that his stomach hurts.</p><p>My mother is at work by the time we get home. My timing isn\u2019t accidental by any means. I take a shower, pick out our clothes for school and put away a load of laundry. I\u2019m so tired that I\u2019m able to fall asleep, without confronting anything at all.</p><p>13.</p><p>\u201dShooting off vicious</p><p>collections of words</p><p>The losers make facts</p><p>by the things they have heard</p><p>And I find myself</p><p>trying hard to defend them.\"</p><p>-The Avett Brothers, All my mistakes</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\u201cGot another one for ya,\u201d Nick says as he takes his seat Monday morning.</p><p>If I have to hear another Chuck Norris joke, I\u2019m literally going to explode. \u201cNot today, my head hurts,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cYou know what Chuck Norris does to a headache?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick, I\u2019m serious. Shut up!\u201d</p><p>Nick withdraws and turns to the unfortunate student to his right.</p><p>Will\u2019s not here. The class waits a few minutes, not really knowing what to do. Apparently this is uncharacteristic of him.</p><p>Javi stands up and gets his books. \u201cFive minute rule,\u201d he says as he walks out the door. He walks right back in though, followed by Will.</p><p>Will shuts the door behind him and goes to his desk and sets a stack of papers down. He's on edge today, and it's obvious to everyone. He hands the first student of each row a smaller stack of the papers to pass back, including me. I look down at my paper and there are about ten sheets stapled together. I start flipping through them and recognize one page is Eddie's poem about the pink balloon. They must all be poems written by students. I don't recognize any of the others.</p><p>\u201cSome of you in here have performed at the slam this semester. I appreciate it. I know it takes a lot of courage.\" He holds up his own copy of the collection of poems.</p><p>\"These are your poems. Some were written by students in my other classes, some by students in here. I want you to read them. Once you\u2019ve read them, I want you to score them. Write a number between zero and ten, ten being the best. Be honest. If you don't like it, give it a low score. We're trying to find the best and worst. Write the score in the bottom right of each page. Go ahead.\u201d He sits at his desk and watches the class.</p><p>I don't like this assignment. It doesn't seem fair. I'm raising my hand. Why am I raising my hand? He looks at me and nods.</p><p>\"What's the point of this assignment?\" I ask.</p><p>His eyes slowly make their way around the classroom. \"Layken, ask that question again after everyone's finished.\"</p><p>He's acting strange.</p><p>I start reading the first poem when Will grabs two slips of paper off of his desk and walks past me. I glance back just as he lays a slip on Eddie\u2019s desk. She picks it up and frowns. He walks back to the front, dropping the other slip on my desk. I pick it up and look it over. It's a detention slip.</p><p>I glance back at Eddie and she just shrugs her shoulders. I wad my slip into a ball and throw it across the room to the trashcan by the door. I make it.</p><p>Over the next half hour, students begin to finish their scoring. Will is taking the stacks as they are finished and he's adding up the totals with his calculator. Once the last of the points have been added up, Will writes the totals on a sheet of paper and walks to the front of his desk and sits. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He holds the paper up in the air and shakes it. \"Is everyone ready to hear which poems sucked?

Except Eddie.</p><p>\"Some of us who wrote those poems may not want to know how many points we got. I know I don't.\"</p><p>Will takes a few steps toward Eddie. \"If you don't care how many points it\u2019s worth, then why did you write it?\"</p> <p>Eddie is quiet for a moment as she thinks about Will's question.</p><p>\"Aside from wanting to be exempt from your final?\" she asks.</p><p>Will nods.</p><p>\"I guess because I had something to say.\"</p><p>Will looks at me. \"Layken, ask your question again.\"</p> <p>My question. I try to remember what my question was. Oh yeah, what's his point?</p><p>\"What's the point of this assignment?\" I ask cautiously.</p><p>Will holds the paper up in front of him that contains the tallied scores, and he rips it right down the middle. He reaches behind him and picks the stack of poems up that everyone scored and he throws them in the trash. He walks to the chalkboard and begins to write something on the board. When he's finished, he steps aside.</p><p>\"The points are not the point; the point is poetry.\" ~Allan Wolf</p><p>The class is quiet as we take in the words sprawled across the board. Will allows a moment of silence before he continues.</p><p>\"It shouldn't matter what anyone else thinks about your words. When you\u2019re on that stage-you share a piece of your soul. You can\u2019t assign points to that.\u201d</p> <p>The bell rings. On any other day, students would be filing out the door. No one has moved; we're all just staring at the writing on the board.</p><p>\"The points are not the point; the point is poetry.\" ~Allan Wolf</p><p>\"Tomorrow, be prepared to learn why it's important for you to write poetry,\" he says.</p><p>There was a moment, in the midst of all the distraction in my head, when I forgot he was Will. I listened to him like he was my teacher.</p><p>Javi is the first to get up, soon followed by the rest of the students. Will is facing the desk with his back to me when Eddie walks up, detention slip in hand. I had already forgotten he gave us detention. She gives me a wink as she passes me and stops at his desk.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cooper?\u201d She\u2019s being respectful, but dramatically so. \u201cIt is my understanding that detention proceeds commencement of the final class period at approximately three-thirty. It is my desire, as I\u2019m sure it is Layken\u2019s desire as well, to be punctual, so that we may serve our fairly deserved sentences with due diligence. Would you be so kind as to share with us the location in which this sentence shall be carried out?\u201d</p><p>Will never looks at her as he walks toward the door. \u201cHere. Just you two. Three-thirty.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019s gone. Just like that.</p> <p>Eddie bursts out laughing. \u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d</p><p>I stand up and walk to the door with her. \u201cOh it wasn\u2019t just me, Eddie. It was both of us.\u201d</p><p>She spins around wide eyed. \u201cOh my god, he knows I know? What's he going to say about it?\u201d</p><p>I shrug my shoulders. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll find out at three-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetention? Duckie gave you detention?\u201d Gavin laughs.</p><p>\u201cMan, he really needs to get laid,\u201d Nick says.</p><p>Nick\u2019s comment causes Eddie to laugh and spew milk out of her mouth. I shoot her a cease and desist look.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he gave you detention,\" Gavin says. \"But you aren\u2019t positive that\u2019s what it\u2019s for, right? For skipping? I mean, he already mentioned that at the slam last week and he didn\u2019t seem too mad.\u201d</p><p>I know what the detention is for. I\u2019m pretty sure I know, anyway. He wants to make sure he can trust Eddie. I'm not positive, though, so I lie.</p><p>\u201cHe said it\u2019s for not turning in the assignment we were supposed to do the day we skipped.\u201d</p><p>Gavin turns to Eddie. \u201cBut you did that one, I remember.\u201d</p><p>Eddie looks at me as she replies to Gavin. \u201cI guess I lost it,\u201d she shrugs.</p><p>Eddie and I meet outside the door to Will's classroom at approximately three-thirty.</p><p>\"You know, the more I think about it, this really sucks,\" Eddie says. \"Why couldn't he just call me or something if he wanted to talk about what I know? I had plans today.\"</p><p>\"Maybe we won't have to stay long,\" I say.</p><p>\"I hate detention. It's boring. I'd rather lay in Will's floor with you than sit in detention,\" she says.</p><p>\"Maybe we can try and make it fun,\" I say.</p><p>She turns to open the door but hesitates, then spins around and faces me. \"You know, you're right. Let's make it fun. I'm pretty sure detention is an hour long. Do you realize how many Chuck Norris puns we can make in a whole hour?\"</p><p>I smile at her. \"Not as many as Chuck Norris could.\"</p><p>She opens the door to detention.</p><p>\"Afternoon, Mr. Cooper,\" Eddie says as she flurries inside.</p><p>\"Take a seat,\" he says as he wipes the point of poetry off the board.</p><p>\"Mr. Cooper, did you know that seats actually stand up when Chuck Norris walks into a room?\" she says.</p><p>I laugh as I follow Eddie to our seats. Rather than taking the two front seats, she keeps walking until she's in the very back of the room where she scoots two desks together. We sit as far from the teacher as possible.</p><p>Will doesn't laugh. He doesn't even smile. He sits in his seat and glares at us while we giggle; like high school girls.</p><p>\"Listen,\" he says as he stands back up and walks toward us. He leans against the window and folds his arms across his chest. He stares at the floor like he's trying to think of a delicate way to broach the subject.</p><p>\"Eddie, I need to know where your head's at. I know you were at my house. I know you know Layken spent the night. I know she told you about our date. I just need to know what you plan to do about it; if you plan to do anything about it.\"</p><p>\"Will, I already told you,\" I say. \"She's not saying anything. There's nothing to say.\"</p><p>He doesn't look at me. He continues to look at Eddie, waiting for her response. I guess mine wasn't good enough.</p><p>I don't know if it's nerves or the fact that I've had the strangest last three days of my life, but I start laughing. Eddie shoots me a questioning glance, but she can't hold it in. She starts laughing, too.</p><p>Will throws his hands up in the air, exasperated. \"What? What the hell is so funny?\" he says. He's getting agitated.</p><p>\"Nothing,\" I say. \"It's just weird. You gave us detention, Will.\" I inhale as I try to control my laughter. \"Couldn't you just like, come over tonight or something? Talk to us about it then? Why'd you give us detention?\"</p><p>He waits until our laughter subsides before he continues. \"This is the first chance I\u2019ve had to talk to either of you. I didn't sleep all night. I wasn't sure if I even had a job to come back to today.\" He looks at Eddie. \"If anything gets out, if anyone finds out that a student slept in my bed with me, I'd get fired. I'd get kicked out of college.\"</p><p>Eddie straightens in her seat and turns to me and smiles. \"You slept in his bed with him? You're holding back vital information. You didn't tell me that,\" she laughs.</p><p>He walks back to the front of the room and throws himself into his chair. He leans onto his desk and sets his face in his hands. This isn\u2019t going how he had planned.</p><p>\"You slept in his bed?\" she whispers, low enough so Will doesn't hear her.</p><p>\"Nothing happened,\" I say. \"Like you said, he's such a bore.\"</p><p>Eddie laughs again, causing me to lose my composure.</p><p>\"Is this funny?\" Will says from his desk. \"Is this a joke to you two?\"</p><p>I can see in his eyes that we're enjoying detention way more than we're supposed to. Eddie isn't fazed, however.</p><p>\"Did you know Chuck Norris doesn't have a funny bone? It tried to make him laugh once, so he ripped it out,\" she says.</p><p>Will lays his head on his desk in defeat. Eddie and I look at each other and our laughter ceases as we respect that he's attempting to have a serious conversation with us.</p><p>Eddie sighs and straightens up in her desk. \"Mr. Cooper?\" she says. \"I won\u2019t say anything. Swear. It's not that big of a deal anyway.\"</p><p>He looks up at her. \"It is a big deal Eddie. That's what I'm trying to tell both of you. If you don't treat this as a big deal, you'll get careless. Something might slip. I've got too much at stake.\"</p><p>We both sigh. The energy in the room is non-existent now. It's like a black hole just sucked all the fun out of detention. Eddie feels it too, so she attempts to rectify it.</p><p>\"Did you know Chuck Norris likes his steaks med-\" Eddie doesn't finish her sentence as Will reaches his limit. He slams his fist against the desk as he stands up. Neither Eddie nor I are laughing at this point. I look at her wide eyed and shake my head, letting her know that Chuck Norris needs to retreat.</p><p>\"This isn't a joke,\" he says. \"This is a big deal.\" He reaches over and takes something out of his drawer and swiftly walks to where we're sitting in the back of the room. He smacks a picture down on the crack where the edges of our desks meet and flips it over. It's a picture of Caulder.</p><p>He points his finger to the picture as he says, \"This boy. This boy is a big deal.\"</p><p>He backs up a step and grabs a desk and turns it around to face us as he sits down.</p><p>\"I don't think we're following you, Will,\" I say as I look at Eddie. She shakes her head in agreement. \"What's Caulder got to do with what Eddie knows?\"</p><p>He takes a deep breath as he leans across his desk and picks the picture back up. I can tell by the look in his eyes that his recollection is unpleasant. He lays the picture down on the desk and leans back in the chair, folding his arms across his chest.</p><p>\"He was with them...when it happened. He watched them die.\"</p><p>I suck in a breath. Eddie and I give him respectful silence as we wait for him to continue. I'm beginning to feel this big.</p><p>\"They said it was a miracle he survived. The car was totaled. When the first person came on the scene, Caulder was still buckled up in what was left of the backseat. He was screaming my mom's name, trying to get her to turn around. For five minutes he had to sit there alone and watch as they died.\"</p><p>Will clears his throat. Eddie reaches under the table and grabs my hand and squeezes it. Neither of us says a word.</p><p>\"I sat in the hospital with him while he recovered for six days. Never left his side-not even for their funeral. When my grandparents came to pick him up and take him home with them, he cried. He didn't want to go. He wanted to stay with me. He begged me to take him back to campus with me. I didn't have a job, I didn't have insurance. I was nineteen. I didn't know the first thing about raising a kid...so I let them take him.\"</p><p>Will stands up and walks to the window. He doesn't say anything for a while as he watches the parking lot slowly empty. His hand goes to his face and it looks like he\u2019s wiping at his eyes. If Eddie wasn't in here right now, I would hug him.</p><p>He eventually turns to face us again. \"Caulder hated me. He was so mad at me he wouldn't return my calls for days. It was in the middle of a football game when I started to question the choice I made. I was studying the football in my hands, running my fingers over the pigskin, across the letters of the brand name printed on the side. This elongated spheroid shaped ball that didn't even weigh a whole pound. I was choosing this ridiculous ball of leather in my hands over my own flesh and blood. I was putting myself, my girlfriend, my scholarship-I was putting everything before this little boy that I loved more than anything in the world. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"I dropped the football and walked right off the field. I got to my grandparent's house at two in the morning and grabbed Caulder right out of bed. I brought him home that night. They begged me not to do it. Said it would be too hard on me and that I wouldn't be able to give him what he needed. I knew they were wrong. I knew all Caulder really needed-was me.\"</p><p>He turns and slowly walks back to the desk in front of us and places his hands on the back of it. He looks at both of us, tears streaming down our faces.</p><p>\"I've spent the last two years of my life trying to convince myself that I made the right decision for him. So my job? My career? This life I'm trying to build for this little boy? It is a big deal. It's a very big deal to me.\"</p><p>He calmly returns the desk to its place in the aisle and walks back to the front of his room, grabs his things and leaves.</p> <p>Eddie gets up and walks to Will's desk and grabs a box of tissues. She brings the box and slumps back down in her seat. I pull out a tissue as we both wipe at our eyes.</p><p>\"God, Layken. How do you do it?\" she says.</p><p>She blows her nose and grabs another tissue out of the box.</p><p>\"How do I do what?\" I sniff as I continue to wipe the tears from my eyes.</p><p>\"How do you not fall in love with him?\"</p> <p>The tears begin flowing just as quickly as they were ceasing. I grab yet another tissue. \"I don't not fall in love with him. I don't not fall in love with him a lot!\"</p><p>She laughs and squeezes my hand as we willingly sit out our much deserved detentions.</p><p>14.</p><p>\u201cAnd I know you need me in the next room over</p><p>But I am stuck in here all paralyzed.\u201d</p><p>-The Avett Brothers, 10,000 words</p> <p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>I've never had sex before. I came really close once, but chickened out at the last minute. My longest relationship was with a boy I met right before I turned seventeen.</p><p>Kerris had a brother who was in college and he brought a friend home with him during Spring Break two summers ago. His name was Seth and he was eighteen. I thought I loved him. I think I really just loved having a boyfriend. He attended the University of Texas, which was a good four hour drive away.</p><p>We had been together for about six months. We talked on the phone and online a lot. I was seventeen at this point and we had discussed it plenty, so I decided I was ready to have sex with him. I had a midnight curfew that night so he rented a hotel room and we told my mother we were going to the movie theater.</p><p>When we got to the hotel, my hands were shaking. I knew I had changed my mind but was too scared to tell him. He had put so much effort into everything. He even brought his own sheets and blankets from home so it would feel more intimate.</p><p>We had been kissing for a while on the bed when he took off my shirt. His hands were making their way to my pants when I started crying. He immediately stopped. Never pressured me, never made me feel guilty for changing my mind. He just kissed me and told me it was okay. We stayed in bed and rented a movie instead.</p><p>It was seven hours later and daytime when we finally woke up. We were both frantic. No one knew where we were, both of our phones had been turned off all night. I knew my parents were worried sick. He was too scared to face them with me so instead he dropped me off at my driveway and left. I remember staring at my house, wanting to be anywhere else but there. I knew they were going to make me talk to them; tell them about where I had been. I hated confrontation.</p><p>I'm standing in front of my jeep now, staring at the gnome filled yard of our house that's not our home. That same feeling of trepidation deep within the pit of my stomach is back. I know my mother is going to want to talk about it all. The cancer. Kel. She'll want to confront it and I'll want to hide.</p> <p>I slowly make my way to the front door and turn the knob, wishing someone was holding it shut from the other side. Her, Kel and Caulder are all seated at the bar.</p><p>They're carving pumpkins. She can't talk now. This is good.</p><p>\"Hey,\" I say to no one in particular as I walk through the front door. She doesn't acknowledge me.</p><p>\"Hey, Layken. Check out my pumpkin!\" Kel says as he swings it around to face me. Its' eyes and mouth are three big X's and he's taped a bag of candy to the side of the pumpkins face.</p><p>\"He's making a sour face. 'Cause he ate some sour skittles,\" he says.</p><p>\"Creative,\" I say.</p><p>\"Look at mine,\" Caulder says as he turns his around. There's just a bunch of huge holes where the pumpkin's face should be.</p><p>\"Oh...what is it?\" I ask him.</p><p>\"It's God.\"</p><p>I cock my head at him, confused. \"God?\"</p><p>Caulder laughs. \"Yeah, God.\" He looks at Kel and in unison they both say, \"Because he's 'holy.'\"</p><p>I roll my eyes and laugh. \"I don't know how you two found each other.\"</p><p>I look at my mom and she's watching me, trying to gauge my mood.</p><p>\"Hey,\" I say, specifically to her this time.</p><p>\"Hey,\" she smiles.</p><p>\"So,\" I say, hoping she'll grasp the double meaning behind what I\u2019m about to say. \"Do you mind if we just carve pumpkins tonight? Is it okay if that's all we do? Just carve pumpkins?\"</p><p>She smiles and turns her attention back to the pumpkin in front of her.</p><p>\"Sure. But we can't carve pumpkins every night, Lake. One of these nights we'll eventually have to stop carving pumpkins.\"</p><p>I grab one of the available pumpkins off the floor and set it on the bar and take a seat when someone knocks at the door.</p><p>\"I'll get it,\" Caulder yells as he jumps down.</p><p>My mother and I both turn to the front door as he opens it. It's Will.</p><p>\"Hey, Buddy. You answering doors here now?\" Will says to him.</p><p>Caulder grabs his hand and pulls him inside.</p><p>\"We're carving pumpkins for Halloween. Come on, Julia bought one for you, too.\" He's pulling Will through the living room and toward the kitchen.</p><p>\"No, it's fine. I'll carve mine another time. I just wanted to bring you home so they can have some family time.\"</p><p>My mother pulls out the available chair on the other side of her. \"Sit down, Will. We're just carving pumpkins tonight. That's all we're doing. Just carving pumpkins.\"</p><p>Caulder already has a pumpkin and is placing it at the table in front of Will's chair.</p><p>\"Okay, then. I guess we're carving pumpkins,\" Will says.</p><p>Caulder hands him a knife and we all sit at the bar-and just carve pumpkins.</p><p>Kel instigates the first awkward moment when he asks why I'm so late getting home from school. Mom eyes me, waiting for my response while Will just cuts away at his pumpkin and doesn't look up.</p><p>\"Eddie and I had detention,\" I say.</p><p>\"Detention? What were you in detention for?\" my mom asks.</p><p>\"We skipped class last week, took a nap in the courtyard.\"</p><p>She brings her scooper down to the table and looks at me, obviously disappointed.</p><p>\"Lake, why would you do something like that? What class did you skip?\"</p><p>I don't reply. I purse my lips together and nudge my head toward Will. My mother looks at Will just as he looks up from his pumpkin.</p><p>He shrugs his shoulders. \"She skipped my class! What was I supposed to do?\" he laughs.</p><p>My mother stands up and pats him on the back as she picks up the phone book.</p><p>\"I'm buying you supper for that.\"</p><p>The whole evening is surreal. Everyone's eating pizza, talking, laughing, including my mother. It's good to hear her laugh. I can see a difference in her tonight. I think simply being able to tell me she was sick has helped relieve some of her stress. I can see it in her eyes, she's more at ease.</p><p>We listen as Kel and Caulder tell us what they want to be for Halloween. Caulder keeps switching back and forth between a Transformer and an angry bird. Kel still hasn't come up with anything.</p><p>I wipe pumpkin remnants up off the floor and take the rag to the sink and rinse it out. I put my elbows on the counter and rest my chin in my hands as I watch them. This is more than likely my mother's last time to carve pumpkins. Next month will be the last time she sees Thanksgiving. After that, she'll have her last Christmas. But she's just sitting here, talking to Will about Halloween plans, laughing. I wish I could freeze this moment. I wish we could just carve pumpkins forever.</p><p>Will and Caulder leave as my mom goes to her room to get ready for her shift. I finish cleaning the kitchen and gather the sacks of pumpkin discard and combine them all into a large trash bag. I take the bag to the curb at the end of the driveway when Will comes outside with his own bag of trash.</p><p>He walks to the end of his driveway before he realizes I'm even there. He smiles at me and lifts the lid, throwing the bag inside.</p><p>\"Hey,\" he says as he puts his hands in his jacket pockets and walks toward me.</p><p>\"Hey,\" I reply.</p><p>\"Hey,\" he says again. He walks past me and sits against the bumper of my jeep.</p><p>\"Hey,\" I reply as I lean against the jeep next to him.</p><p>\"Hey.\"</p><p>\"Stop it,\" I laugh.</p><p>We both wait for the other to talk again, but instead there's just an awkward silence. I hate awkward silences, so I break it.</p><p>\"I'm sorry I told Eddie. She's just so smart. She figured it out and thought there was more going on than there is, so I had to tell her the truth. I didn't want her to think bad of you.\"</p><p>He leans his head back and stares up at the sky.</p><p>\"I trust your judgment, Lake. I even trust Eddie. I just wanted her to know why this job is so important to me. Or maybe I said all that so you would know why it's so important to me.\"</p><p>My brain is too tired to even analyze his comment. \"Either way, I know it was hard for you...telling us everything like that. Thank you.\"</p><p>We watch as a car passes by and pulls into the driveway next to us. A woman gets out, followed by two girls. They\u2019re all carrying pumpkins.</p><p>\"You know, I don't know a single person on this whole street other than you and Caulder,\" I say.</p><p>He directs his eyes to the house that the three people just entered. \"That's Erica. She's been married to her husband, Gus, for about twenty years I think. They have two daughters, both teenagers. The oldest one is who babysits Caulder sometimes.</p><p>\"The couple to the right of Caulder and I have been here the longest, Bob and Melinda. Their son just joined the military. They were great after my parents died. Melinda cooked for us every day for months. She still brings something over about once a week.</p><p>\"The house over there?\" He points down the street. \"He's the one renting your house to you. His name is Scott. He owns six of the houses on this street alone. He's a good guy, but his renters come and go a lot. Those are about the only people I know anymore.\"</p><p>I look at all the houses along the street. They're all so similar and I can't help but try to imagine the differences of all the families inside the homes. I wonder if any of them are hiding secrets? If any of them are falling in love? Or out of love? Are they happy? Sad? Scared? Broke? Lonely? Do they appreciate what they have? Do Gus and Erica appreciate their health? Does Scott appreciate his supplemental rental income? Because every bit of it, every last bit of it is fleeting. Nothing is permanent. The only thing any of us have in common is the inevitable. We'll all eventually die.</p><p>\"There was this one girl,\" Will says. \"She moved into a house on the street a while back. I still remember the moment I saw her pull up in the U-Haul. She was so confident in that thing. It was a hundred times bigger than her, yet she backed it right up without even asking for help. I watched as she put it in park and propped her leg up on the dash, like driving a U-Haul was something she did every day. Piece of cake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"I had to leave for work but Caulder had already run across the street. He was imaginary sword fighting with the little boy that had been in the U-Haul. I was just going to yell at him to come get in the car, but there was something about that girl. I just had to meet her. I walked across the street but she never even noticed me. She was watching her brother play with Caulder with this distant look on her face.</p><p>\"I stood beside the U-Haul and I just watched her. I stared at her while she looked on with the saddest look in her eyes. I wanted to know what she was thinking about, what was going on in her head. What had made her so sad? I wanted to hug her so bad. When she finally got out of the U-Haul and I introduced myself to her, it took all I had to let go of her hand. I wanted to hold onto it forever. I wanted to let her know that she wasn't alone. Whatever burden it was that she was carrying around, I wanted to carry it for her.\"</p><p>I lean my head on his shoulder and he puts his arm around me.</p><p>\"I wish I could, Lake. I wish I could take it all away. Unfortunately, that's not how it works. It doesn't just go away. That's what your mom is trying to tell you. She needs you to accept it, and she needs for Kel to know, too. You need to give that to her.\"</p> <p>\"I know, Will. I just can't. Not yet. I'm not ready to deal with it yet.\"</p><p>He pulls me to him and hugs me.</p><p>\"You'll never be ready for it, Lake. No one ever is.\"</p><p>He lets go of me and walks away. And he's right again, but I don't care this time.</p><p>\"Lake? Can I come in?\" Mom says from outside the bedroom door.</p> <p>\"It's open,\" I say.</p><p>She walks in. She's got her scrubs on now. She sits on the bed next to me as I'm writing in my notebook.</p><p>\"What are you writing?\" she asks.</p><p>\"A poem.\"</p><p>\"For school?\"</p><p>\"No, for me.\"</p> <p>\"I didn't know you wrote poetry,\" she says as she tries to peek over my shoulder at it.</p><p>\"I don't, really. If we read our poetry at Club N9NE we're exempt from the final. I'm thinking about doing one, but I don't know. The thought of getting up there in front of all those people makes me nervous.\"</p><p>\"Push your boundaries, Lake. That's what they're there for.\"</p><p>I flip the poem upside down and sit up. \"So what's up?\"</p><p>She smiles at me and reaches to my face and tucks my hair behind my ear.</p><p>\"Not much,\" she says. \"I just had a few minutes before I had to leave for work. I wanted to let you know that it's my last night. I'm not working anymore after tonight.\"</p><p>I break our stare and lean forward and grab my pen. I put the cap back on it and close my notebook, tucking both the items inside my backpack.</p><p>\"I'm still carving pumpkins, Mom.\"</p> <p>She slowly inhales and stands up, hesitates, then walks back out the door.</p><p>15.</p><p>\u201cForever I will move like the world that turns</p><p>beneath me</p><p>And when I lose my direction, I\u2019ll look up to the</p><p>sky</p><p>And when the black cloak drags upon the ground</p><p>I\u2019ll be ready to surrender, and remember</p><p>Well we\u2019re all in this together</p><p>If I live the life I\u2019m given, I won\u2019t be scared to</p><p>die.\u201d</p><p>-The Avett Brothers, Once and Future Carpenter</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Will walks into the classroom carrying a small projector. He sets it on the desk and begins hooking it up to his laptop.</p><p>\"What we doing today, Mr. Cooper?\" Gavin asks.</p><p>Will continues to prepare the projector as he responds to Gavin. \"I want to show you why you should write poetry.\" He swings the plug around his desk and inserts it into the outlet on the wall.</p><p>\"I know why people write poetry,\" Javi says. \"Because they're a bunch of emotional saps with nothin' better to do than whine about ex-girlfriends and dead dogs.\"</p><p>\"You're wrong, Javi,\" I say. \"That's called country music.\"</p><p>Everyone laughs, including Will. He sits at his desk and turns the laptop on and glances at Javi.</p><p>\"So what? If it makes someone feel better to write a poem about their dead dog, then great. Let them. What if some girl broke your heart Javi, and you decided to vent with a pen and paper? That's your business.\"</p><p>\"That's fair,\" Javi says. \"People are free to write what they want to write about. But the thing that bothers me is, what if the person who writes it doesn't want to relive it? What if a dude performs a slam about a bad breakup, but then he gets over it and moves on? He falls in love with some other chick, but now there's probably this YouTube video floating around on the internet of him talking all sad about how his heart got broke. That sucks. If you perform it, or even write it down, someday you'll have to relive it.\"</p><p>Will stops fidgeting with the projector and stands up and turns to the board. He grabs a piece of chalk, writes something and then steps aside.</p><p>The Avett Brothers</p><p>Will points to the name on the board. \"Has anyone heard of them?\" He looks at me and gives his head a slight shake, indicating he doesn't want me to speak up.</p><p>\"Sounds familiar,\" someone says from the back of the room.</p><p>\"Well,\u201d he says as he paces the room. \u201cThey're famous philosophers who speak and write extremely wise, thought-provoking words of wisdom.\"</p><p>I try to stifle my laugh. He's mostly right, though.</p><p>\"They were asked about this once. I believe they were doing a reading. Someone asked them a question about their poetry, and if it was hard having to relive their words each time they performed. Their reply was, that although they had ideally moved beyond that-from the person or event that inspired their words at that point in time, it doesn't mean someone listening to them wasn't in that.</p><p>\"So? So what if the heartache you wrote last year isn't what you're feeling today. It may be exactly what the person in the front row is feeling. What you\u2019re feeling now, and the person you may reach with your words five years from now-that's why you write poetry.\"</p><p>He flips on the overhead projector and I immediately recognize the words projected onto the wall. It's the piece he performed at the slam on our date. His piece about death.</p><p>\"See this? I wrote this piece two years ago, after my parents died. I was angry. I was hurt. I wrote down exactly what I was feeling. When I read it now, I don't share those same feelings. Do I regret writing it? No. Because there's a chance that someone in this very room may relate to this. It might mean something to them.\"</p><p>He moves his mouse and the projector zooms in, highlighting one of the lines of his poem.</p><p>People don't like to talk about death because...</p><p>it makes them sad.</p><p>\"You never know, someone in this very room might relate to this. Does talking about death make you sad? Of course it does. Death sucks. It's not a fun thing to talk about. But sometimes, you need to talk about it.\"</p><p>I know what he's doing. I fold my arms across my chest and glare at him as he looks directly at me. He glances back to his computer, highlighting another line.</p><p>If they only would have been prepared, accepted the inevitable, laid out their plans,</p><p>\"What about this one? My parents weren't prepared to die. I was angry at them for this. I was left with bills, debt, and a child. But what if they would have had warning? A chance to discuss it, to lay out their plans? If talking about death wasn't so easy to avoid while they were alive, then maybe I wouldn't have had such a hard time dealing with it after they died.\"</p><p>He's looking directly at me as he zooms in on another line.</p><p>understood that it wasn\u2019t just their lives at hand.</p><p>\"Everyone assumes they have at least one more day. If my parents had any clue what was about to happen to them before it happened, they would have done everything in their power to prepare us. Everything. It's not that they weren't thinking about us, it's that they weren't thinking about death.\"</p><p>He highlights the last line of his poem.</p><p>Death. The only thing inevitable in life...</p><p>I look at the phrase and I read it. I read it again. I read it again, and again, and again. I read it until the end of the class period, after everyone around me has left. Everyone but Will.</p><p>He's sitting at his desk, watching me. Waiting for me to understand.</p><p>\"I get it, Will,\" I finally whisper. \u201cI get it. In the first line, when you said that death was the only thing inevitable in life...you emphasized the word death. But when you said it again at the end of the poem, you didn't emphasize the word death, you emphasized the word life. You put the emphasis on life at the end. I get it, Will. You're right. She's not trying to prepare us for her death. She's trying to prepare us for her life. For what she has left of it.\"</p><p>He leans forward and turns the projector off. I grab my stuff, and I go home.</p><p>I sit on the edge of my mother's bed. She's asleep in the center of it. She doesn't have a side anymore, now that she sleeps in it alone.</p><p>She's still wearing her scrubs. When she wakes up and takes them off, it'll be the last time she takes off a pair of scrubs. I wonder if that's why she's still wearing them, because she realizes this too.</p><p>I watch the rhythm of her body as she breathes. With every breath that she inhales, I can hear the struggle of her lungs within her chest. The struggle of lungs that failed her.</p><p>I reach over and stroke her hair. When I do, a few of the strands fall off into my fingers. I pull my hand back and slowly wrap them around my finger as I walk to my room and pick my purple hair clip up off the floor. I open the clip and place the strands of hair inside and snap it shut. I place the clip under my bedroom pillow and I go back to my mother's room. I slide into the bed beside her and wrap my arms around her. She finds my hand and we interlock fingers as we talk without saying a single word.</p><p>16.</p><p>\" \"</p><p>-The Avett Brothers, COMPLAINTE D'VN MATELOT MOURANT</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>After my mother falls back to sleep, I go to the grocery store. Kel's favorite food is basagna. It's how he used to say lasagna, so we still call it basagna. I gather everything I need for the meal and I go back home and start cooking.</p><p>\"Smells like basagna,\" Mom says as she comes out of her bedroom. She's in regular clothes now. She must have taken her scrubs off for the last time.</p><p>\"Yep. I figured we could make Kel his favorite tonight. He'll need it.\"</p><p>She walks to the sink and washes her hands before she starts helping me layer the noodles.</p><p>\"So, I guess we finally stopped carving pumpkins?\" she asks.</p><p>\"Yep,\" I reply. \"The pumpkins have all been carved.\"</p><p>She laughs.</p><p>\"Mom? Before he gets here, we need to talk. About what's going to happen to him.\"</p><p>\"I want to, Lake. I want to talk about it.\"</p><p>\"Why don't you want him to be with me? Do you not think I'm capable? That I wouldn't make a good mom?\"</p><p>She layers the last of the noodles as I cover them with sauce.</p><p>\"Lake, I don't think that at all. I just want you to be able to live your life. I've spent the entire last eighteen years raising you, teaching you everything I know. It's supposed to be time for you to go screw up. Make mistakes. Not raise a child.\"</p><p>\"But sometimes life doesn't happen in chronological order,\" I say. \"You're a prime example of that. If it did, you wouldn't die until you were supposed to. Until you were seventy-seven or so, I think. That's the average age of death.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She laughs and shakes her head.</p><p>\"Seriously, Mom. I want him. I want to raise him. He'll want to stay with me, you know he will. You have to give us the choice. We haven't had a choice in any of this. You have to give us this one.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" she says.</p><p>\"Okay? Okay you'll think about it? Or okay, okay?\"</p> <p>\"Okay, okay.\"</p><p>I hug her. I hug her tighter than I've ever hugged her before.</p><p>\"Lake?\" she says. \"You're getting basagna sauce all over me.\"</p><p>I pull away and realize I'm still holding the spatula and it's dripping all over her back.</p><p>\"Why can't he come over?\" Kel asks after I pull in the driveway and send Caulder home.</p> <p>\"I told you already. Mom needs to talk to us.\"</p><p>We walk inside the house and Mom is putting the basagna in the oven.</p><p>\"Mom, guess what?\" Kel says as he runs to the kitchen.</p><p>\"What, Sweetie?\"</p><p>\"Our school is having a costume contest on Halloween. The winner gets fifty bucks!\"</p><p>\"Fifty bucks? Wow. Have you decided what you want to be yet?\"</p> <p>\"Not yet.\" He walks over to the bar and throws his backpack down.</p><p>\"Did your sister tell you we're all having a talk tonight?\"</p><p>\"Yeah. She didn't have to, though. We're having basagna.\"</p><p>My mother and I both look at him.</p><p>\"Every time we have basagna it's bad news. Y'all cooked basagna when grandpa died. Y'all cooked basagna when y'all told me dad was dead. Y'all cooked basagna when y'all told me we were moving to Michigan. Y'all are cooking basagna right now. Someone's either dying or we're moving back to Texas.\"</p><p>My mom looks at me wide eyed, questioning our timing. He seems to have opened it up for an even earlier discussion. She walks over to him and sits down. I follow suit.</p><p>\"You're very observant, that's for sure,\" she says.</p><p>\"So, which one is it?\" he asks, looking up at her.</p> <p>She places her hand on the side of his face and strokes it. \"I have lung cancer, Kel.\"</p><p>He immediately throws his arms around her and hugs her. She strokes the back of his head, but he doesn't cry. They are both silent for a while as she waits for him to speak.</p><p>\"Are you gonna die?\" he finally asks. His voice is muffled because his head is buried in her shirt.</p><p>\"I am, Sweetie. But I don't know when. Until then though, we're going to spend a lot of time together. I quit my job today so that I can spend more time with you.\"</p><p>I wasn't sure how he would react. At only nine years old, he probably won't grasp the true reality of it until after she actually passes away. My father's death was sudden and unexpected, which naturally prompted a more dramatic reaction from him.</p><p>\"But what about after you die? Who are we gonna go live with?\"</p><p>\"Your sister is an adult now. You're going to live with her.\"</p><p>\"But I wanna stay here, by Caulder,\" he says as he lifts his head from her shirt and looks at me. \"Layken, are you gonna make me move back to Texas with you?\"</p><p>Up until this very second, I had every intention of moving back to Texas.</p><p>\"No, Kel. We're staying right here.\"</p><p>Kel sighs, soaking in everything he's just been told. \"Are you scared, Mom?\" he asks her.</p><p>\"Not anymore,\" she says. \"I've had a lot of time to accept it. In fact, I feel lucky. Unlike your dad, at least I've got warning. Now I get to spend more time with the two of you here at home.\"</p><p>He lets go of my mother and puts his elbows on the bar.</p><p>\"You have to promise me something, Layken.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" I respond.</p><p>\"Don't ever make basagna again.\"</p><p>We all laugh. We all laugh. This was the hardest thing my mother and I have ever had to do, and we're laughing. Kel is amazing.</p><p>Two hours later, we have a huge spread of basagna, bread sticks and salad. There's no way we're eating all of this.</p><p>\"Kel, why don't you go see if Caulder and Will have eaten yet,\" my mother says as she eyes the food with me. Kel darts out the door.</p><p>She sets two more places at the table while I fill drinks with tea.</p><p>\"We need to talk to Will about helping out with Kel,\" I tell her.</p><p>\"Will? Why?\"</p><p>\"Because, I want to take you to your treatments from now on. It's too much for Brenda. I can miss a day of school every now and then, or we can go when I get out.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" she says as we finish preparing the table.</p><p>Kel and Caulder come running through the front door, followed by Will a moment later.</p><p>\"Kel said we're having basagna?\" Will asks hesitantly.</p><p>\"Yes sir,\" my mother says as she scoops basagna onto plates.</p><p>\"What is basagna? Bologne lasagna?\"</p><p>He looks scared.</p><p>\"It's basagna. And it's the last time we'll ever have it so you better enjoy it,\" she says.</p><p>Will walks to the table and waits for Mom and I to sit before he takes his seat.</p><p>We pass around breadsticks and salad until everyone's plates are filled. And just like last night, Kel is the first one to make it awkward.</p><p>\"My mom's dying, Caulder.\"</p><p>Will glances at me and I give him a half smile, letting him know we talked.</p><p>\"When she dies, I'm gonna live with Layken. Just like you live with Will. It's like we'll be the same. All of our parents will be dead, and we'll live with our brother and sister.\"</p><p>\"Cool. That's crazy,\" Caulder says.</p><p>\"Caulder!\" Will yells.</p><p>\"It's fine, Will,\" my mom says. \"It is kind of crazy if you think about it from the perspective of a nine-year-old.\"</p><p>\"Mom,\" Kel says. \"What about your bedroom? Can I have it? It's bigger than mine.\"</p><p>\"No,\" I say. \"It's got a bathroom in it. I get her bedroom.\"</p><p>Kel looks defeated. I don't budge, though. I'm getting the bedroom with the bathroom.</p><p>\"Kel, you can have my computer,\" my mother says.</p><p>\"Sweet!\"</p><p>I look at Will, hoping this conversation isn't weirding him out, but he's laughing. This is exactly what he was hoping would happen. Acceptance.</p><p>Over dinner, we all discuss what will happen over the next few months and make arrangements for Caulder and Kel while mom receives her treatments. Will agreed to let Kel come over whenever he needed to and said he'll continue to take them to school. I'll be picking them up on the way home every day, unless I'm at a treatment with mom. She made Will agree to let her cook them supper most nights in return for his help. The entire night was a success. I feel like together, we all just punched death square in the face.</p><p>\"I'm exhausted,\" my mom says. \"I need to take a shower and get to bed.\"</p><p>She walks into the kitchen where Will is washing dishes at the sink. She puts her arms around his waist and hugs him from behind. \"Thanks, Will. For everything.\"</p><p>He turns around and hugs her back.</p><p>When she walks past me on her way to her bedroom, she purposefully nudges me with her shoulder. She doesn't speak a word but I know what she's hinting at-she's giving me her approval. Again. Too bad it doesn't count.</p><p>I wipe the table off and walk to the sink to rinse out the rag.</p><p>\"Eddie's birthday is Thursday. I don't know what I should get her.\"</p><p>\"Well, I know what you shouldn't get her,\" he says.</p><p>\"Believe me, I know,\" I laugh. \"I think Gavin's taking her out Thursday night. Maybe I'll do something for her on Friday.\"</p><p>\"Oh, speaking of Friday. Do you guys need me to watch Kel Friday? I forgot Caulder and I go to Detroit this weekend.\"</p><p>\"No, you're fine. Family stuff?\"</p><p>\"Yeah. We stay with our grandparents one weekend a month. Kind of a truce we worked out for me stealing him away in the middle of the night.\"</p><p>\"That's fair enough,\u201d I say. I reach over to the sink and unplug the drain.</p><p>\"So you won't be at the slam Thursday?\" he asks.</p><p>\"No. We'll watch Caulder that night, though. Just send him over after school.\"</p><p>He puts the last dish in the strainer and dries his hands on the towel.</p><p>\"It's pretty weird isn't it? How everything worked out? You guys moving here when you did? Kel and Caulder finding each other, right when Kel probably needed a best friend the most? Him taking your mother's news so well? It just all worked out.\"</p><p>He turns toward me and smiles. \"I'm proud of you, Lake. You did good today.\" He plants one of his lingering kisses on my forehead, then walks to the living room.</p><p>\"Caulder still needs to take a shower, I guess we need to go. I'll see you tomorrow,\" he says.</p><p>\"Yeah. See ya.\"</p><p>I sigh as I think about the one thing that isn't on his mind. The one incredibly huge thing that didn't work out; us.</p><p>I'm starting to accept it. That we won't be together. That we can't be together. Especially the last two nights he's been here. It really feels like we've finally transitioned. There are definitely still moments, but none we're not able to overcome. It's only October and he'll be my teacher until June. That's still eight long months. When I look at the shift my life has made in the past eight months, I can't fathom what my life will be eight months from now. When I lie down and close my eyes, I make a resolution. Will is not going to be my first priority anymore. I'm putting my mother first, Kel second and life third.</p><p>Finally. He no longer has a hold on me.</p><p>\"Eddie, will you go grab me a chocolate milk, Babe? I forgot to get one.\" Gavin is giving Eddie puppy dog eyes. Eddie rolls her eyes and gets up. As soon as she leaves the table, he turns toward us and starts whispering.</p><p>\"Tomorrow night. Getty\u2019s. Six o'clock. Bring a pink balloon. And we're going to the slam afterward.\"</p><p>\"Gavin, are you crazy? That's not funny, she'll be pissed,\" I whisper.</p><p>\"Just trust me.\"</p><p>She's back at the table with the chocolate milk.</p><p>\"Here, Babe. You owe me fifty-cents.\"</p><p>\"I owe you my heart,\" Gavin says as she hands him the milk.</p><p>She slaps him lightly across the head. \"Oh, grow a pair! You're such a sap,\" she says, right before she kisses his cheek.</p><p>I reluctantly walk into Getty\u2019s pizza with a pink balloon in my hand. Gavin and Nick are gathered in the back of the room at a booth. He motions for me to join them. There are so many pink balloons. She's going to be pissed.</p><p>Gavin grabs my balloon and writes something on it with a big marker. \"Here,\" Gavin says as he hands me the fistful of balloons. \"Take all these and go to the back by the bathrooms. I'll come get you when it's time, she'll be here soon.\"</p><p>He shoves me toward the bathroom before I have a chance to object. I stand in a corner in the hallway between the men's room and the janitors\u2019 closet. I look up at all the balloons, and that's when I notice there are names written on each one of them.</p><p>Moments later, an older gentleman walks down the hall toward me.</p><p>\"Are you Layken?\" he asks.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I reply.</p><p>\"I'm Joel, Eddie\u2019s foster dad.\"</p><p>\"Oh, hey.\"</p><p>\"Gavin wants you out front, I'll take the balloons now. Eddie's out there. She thinks I went to the bathroom so don't say anything about the balloons.\"</p><p>\"Uh, okay.\" I hand him the balloons and walk back to the table.</p><p>\"Layken! You came! Guys this is so sweet,\" Eddie says. She starts to sit at the booth when Gavin pulls her back up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"We're not eating yet. We need to go outside.\"</p><p>\"Outside? But it's cold out there.\"</p><p>\"Come on,\" he says as he pulls her toward the door.</p><p>We all follow Gavin outside and stand next to Eddie. I look at Nick but he shrugs, implying he doesn't know what's going on, either. Gavin pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket and stands in front of Eddie.</p> <p>\"I didn't write this letter, Sweetie. But I was told to read it.\"</p><p>Eddie looks at us and smiles, trying to gain hints from our expressions. We can't give her any, because we don't even know.</p><p>It was July 4th when you came to me. Independence Day. You were fourteen. You burst in the door and went straight to the refrigerator, telling me you needed a sprite. I didn't have any sprite. You told me it was okay and you grabbed a Dr. Pepper instead. You freaked me out. I told the caseworker there was no way I could keep you. I'd never fostered a teenager before. She told me she would find you somewhere to go the next day, that she just needed me to keep you for the night.</p><p>I was so nervous. I didn't know what to say to a fourteen year old girl. I didn't know what kinds of things they liked, what shows they watched. I was clueless. But you made it so easy. You were so worried about making me feel comfortable.</p><p>Later that night when it was dark outside-we heard fireworks. You grabbed my hand and pulled me off the couch and drug me outside. We laid on the grass in the front yard and we watched the sky. You didn't shut up. You told me all about the family you just came from, the family before that, and the family before that. The whole time you were talking, I was listening. Listening to this little girl, so full of life. So full and enthralled with a life that tried so hard to knock her down.</p> <p>Eddie gasps when she sees Joel in the window of the restaurant with dozens of pink balloons. He walks outside and stands beside Gavin. Gavin continues reading the letter.</p><p>I've never been able to give you much. Other than eventually teaching you how to park, I've never even taught you very much. But you've taught me more than you will ever know. And on this very special birthday, your eighteenth birthday-you no longer belong to the state of Michigan. And as of right now, you legally no longer belong to me. You no longer belong to any of the following people that once held claim to you and your past.</p><p>Joel starts reading names out loud as he releases balloons one by one. Eddie is crying as we all watch the balloons slowly disappear into the darkness. He continues releasing them, until all 29 siblings and all 13 parents names have been read and released.</p><p>He still has one pink balloon remaining in his hand. Across the front of it, in big black letters, it says DAD.</p><p>Gavin folds the paper up and takes a step back as Joel walks toward Eddie.</p><p>\"I hope for your birthday, you\u2019ll accept this gift,\" Joel says as he hands her the pink balloon. \"I want to be your Dad, Eddie. I want to be your family for the rest of your life.\"</p> <p>Eddie hugs him and they cry. The rest of us slowly walk back inside Getty\u2019s so they can have their moment.</p><p>\"Oh my god, I need a napkin,\" I sniff as I search for something to wipe my eyes. I grab some napkins off the counter when I look at Nick and Gavin. They're both crying. I grab a few more napkins for them as we walk back to our booth.</p><p>17.</p><p>\u201cIf I get murdered in the city</p><p>don\u2019t go revengin\u2019 in my name</p><p>One person dead from such is plenty</p><p>No need to go get locked away.\u201d</p><p>-The Avett Brothers, Murder in the City</p> <p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>I can honestly say I feel like I've moved through the five stages of grief in every aspect of my life.</p><p>I have accepted my father's death. I accepted his death months before we even moved to Michigan. I've accepted my mother's fate. I realize she hasn't even died yet, and that the stages of grief will once again recommence when she does. But I know it won't be as hard.</p><p>I've accepted living in Michigan. The song I listened to on repeat at Will's house in the floor was called Weight of Lies. A portion of the lyrics say,</p><p>\"The weight of lies will bring you down, follow you to every town 'cause</p><p>nothing happens here that doesn't happen there.\"</p><p>Every time the song looped, all I ever heard was the part about the lies-and how they weigh you down. Tonight as I drive toward Detroit in my jeep, I know what those words really mean. It's not just lies they're referring to. It's life. You can't run to another town, another place, another state. Whatever it is you\u2019re running from-it goes with you. It stays with you until you find out how to confront it.</p><p>Whatever it is I was hoping to run back to Texas from, it would eventually make its way back to me. So here I am in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Where I'll stay. And I'm okay with that.</p><p>I've accepted the situation with Will. I don't blame him at all for what he chose. Sure, I had fantasies of him sweeping me off my feet, telling me he doesn't need a career when he has love. The reality of it is, if he would have put his feelings for me first; it would've been hard to accept that he could so easily throw away the things that are the most important to him. It would have said a lot less about his character. So, I don't blame him, I respect him. And someday when I'm ready, I'll thank him.</p><p>I pull up to the club a little after eight o'clock. Gavin had a surprise for Eddie so they took a detour, said they'd be here late. The parking lot is unusually crowded, so I have to take a spot in the back of the building. When I get out of the car, I take a deep breath and prepare myself. I'm not sure when it was that I decided I was going to perform tonight, but I'm having second thoughts.</p><p>My mother's words linger in my head as I make my way to the front door. \"Push your boundaries Lake, that\u2019s what they\u2019re there for.\"</p><p>I can do this. They're just words. Repeat them and you're done. It's that simple.</p><p>I walk in the door a few minutes late. I can tell the sac is about to perform because you could hear a pin drop. I sneak in and quietly make my way to the back of the room. I don't want to draw attention to myself, so I slide into an empty booth. I take my phone out to turn the volume down and text Eddie letting her know where I'm sitting. That's when it happens; I hear him.</p><p>Will is standing in front of the microphone on the stage, performing a piece as the sacrifice.</p><p>I used to love the ocean.</p><p>Everything about her.</p><p>Her coral reefs, her white caps, her roaring waves, the rocks they lap, her pirate legends and mermaid tails,</p><p>Treasures lost and treasures held...</p><p>And ALL</p><p>Of her fish</p><p>In the sea.</p><p>Yes, I used to love the ocean,</p><p>Everything about her.</p><p>The way she would sing me to sleep as I lay in my bed</p><p>then wake me with a force</p><p>That I soon came to dread.</p><p>Her fables, her lies, her misleading eyes,</p><p>I'd drain her dry</p><p>If I cared enough to.</p><p>I used to love the ocean,</p><p>Everything about her.</p><p>Her coral reefs, her white caps, her roaring waves, the rocks they lap, her pirate legends and mermaid tails, treasures lost and treasures held.</p><p>And ALL</p><p>Of her fish</p><p>In the sea.</p><p>Well, if you've ever tried navigating your sailboat through her stormy seas, you would realize that her white caps are your enemies. If you've ever tried swimming ashore when your leg gets a cramp and you just had a huge meal of In-n-Out burgers that's weighing you down, and her roaring waves are knocking the wind out of you, filling your lungs with water as you flail your arms, trying to get someone's attention, but your friends</p><p>just</p><p>wave</p><p>back at you?</p><p>And if you've ever grown up with dreams in your head about life, and how one of these days you would pirate your own ship and have your own crew and that all of the mermaids</p><p>would love</p><p>Well, you would realize...</p><p>Like I eventually realized...</p><p>That all the good things about her?</p><p>All the beautiful?</p><p>It's not real.</p><p>It's fake.</p><p>So you keep your ocean,</p><p>I'll take the Lake.</p><p>Air. Or Water. I don't know which one I need. I slide out of the booth and head toward the front door but make a beeline for the bathroom. I just need silence.</p><p>When I open the door to the bathroom, the stalls are empty. There's a girl washing her hands at the only available sink, so I decide to wait on the water. I pick the big stall. I lock it behind me and lean up against the door.</p><p>Did that just really happen? Does he know I'm even here? No, he doesn't. I told him I wasn't coming. He didn't intend for me to hear it. Even so, he wrote it. He said himself that he writes what he's feeling. Oh my god, he loves me. Will Cooper is in love with me.</p><p>I've known all along how he felt about me. I can see it in the way he looks at me. But to hear his words and the emotions behind them-how he said my name. How am I supposed to face him? I'm not. He still doesn't know I'm here, I just have to leave. I need to leave before he sees me.</p><p>I open the bathroom door and scan the area but I don't see him. Luckily, another performer is on stage so most of the eyes are glued to the front of the room. I slip through the entryway and out the front door.</p><p>\"Layken! Look what Gavin got me!\" Eddie is making her way inside, holding her hair back, wanting me to look at her ears.</p><p>\"Eddie, I've got to go.\"</p><p>Her smile fades.</p><p>\"I'll call you later.\" I brush past her without looking at the earrings. \"You didn't see me!\" I yell behind me as I go.</p><p>I make my way around the building and smash into Javier as he's rounding the corner. Good grief! Is the whole class here? Someone's going to let it slip that I was here. I don't want Will to know I saw him.</p><p>\"Hey, what's the hurry?\" he asks as I slip between him and the wall.</p><p>\"I gotta go. I'll see you tomorrow.\" I quickly walk away. I don't have time for chit chat. I just want to get in my jeep and pull out of this parking lot as soon as I can.</p><p>\"Wait, I'll walk you to your car,\" he says as he catches up to me.</p><p>\"I'm fine, Javi. Go ahead and go inside, they already started.\"</p><p>\"Layken, we're in Detroit. You're parked behind a club. I'm walking you to your car.\"</p><p>\"Fine. But walk fast.\"</p><p>\"What's your hurry?\" he asks as we make our way to the rear of the building.</p><p>\"I'm just tired. I need sleep,\" I say as I slow down, feeling confident that Will didn't see me.</p><p>\"There's a caf\u00e9 down the road. Want to go grab some coffee?\" he asks.</p><p>\"No, thanks. I don't need caffeine, I need my bed.\"</p><p>He is silent as we make our way to my jeep in the back of the lot. I reach down to grab my keys out of my-shit! My purse. I left my purse in the booth.</p><p>\"Shit!\" I say as I kick at the gravel in front of me. My shoe loosens a piece of rock and it flicks against the door of my jeep.</p><p>\"What's wrong?\" he asks.</p><p>\"My purse. I left my keys and my purse inside.\" I fold my arms across my chest and lean against the jeep.</p><p>\"It's not that big of a deal. We'll go back inside and get them.\"</p><p>\"No, I don't want to. Would you mind getting it for me?\" I smile at him, hoping it will be enough.</p><p>\"Layken, you don't need to stay back here by yourself.\"</p><p>\"Fine. I'll just text Eddie to bring it out. Do you have your phone?\"</p><p>He pats his pockets. \"No, it's in my truck. Come on, you can use it.\" Javi says this as he reaches down and takes my hand and leads me toward his truck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He unlocks his door and reaches inside for his phone.</p><p>\"It's dead,\" he says as he plugs it into the charger. \"Give it couple minutes to get a charge, then you can call her.\"</p><p>\"Thanks,\" I say as I lean against his truck and wait.</p><p>He stands next to me as we wait for the phone to charge. \"It's snowing again,\" Javi says as he wipes something off my arm.</p> <p>I look up and see the falling flakes contrasted against the black sky. I guess we're about to finally see what a Michigan Winter really looks like.</p><p>I turn to face Javi. I was about to ask him something about snow tires, or plows but it slips my mind as soon as his hands grasp my face and his tongue makes its' way into my mouth. I turn my face and push against his chest with my hands. When he feels my resistance his face backs away from mine, but his body is still pressed against me, pushing me against the cold metal of his truck.</p><p>\"What?\" he smiles. \"I thought you wanted me to kiss you.\"</p><p>\"No, Javi.\" I'm still pushing against him with my hands but he doesn't budge.</p><p>\"Come on,\" he says with a smug grin on his face. \"You didn't leave your keys inside. You want this.\" His mouth encircles mine again and my pulse starts to race against my chest. It's not the same reaction I get when Will makes my pulse race. This time it's more like fight or flight mode. I try to scream at him, but his hands are pulling my face into his so hard that I can't catch a breath. I try to move but he's using his body to pin me against his truck, making it virtually impossible for me to break free.</p> <p>I close my eyes. Think, Layken. Think.</p><p>Just as I'm about to bite down on his lip, Javi pulls away from me. But he keeps going backward. Someone is dragging him away from me. He falls to the ground and Will straddles him, grabs hold of his shirt and sends a blow straight to Javi's jaw. Javi falls back to the ground but turns over and pushes off against it, causing Will to stumble backward.</p><p>\"Stop!\" I scream.</p><p>Will is knocked to the ground when Javi returns the punch. I'm afraid Javi is going to hit him again, so I throw myself between them just as Javi swings a punch intended for Will-straight into my back. I fall forward and land on Will. I try to catch a breath, but I have none. I can't inhale.</p><p>\"Lake,\" Will says as he rolls me onto the ground next to him. His worry is fleeting, however, as rage fills his eyes. He grabs the door handle of the car next to us and starts to pull himself up.</p><p>\"I didn't mean to hit you,\" Javi says as he walks toward me.</p> <p>I'm on the ground so I don't see what happens next, but I hear a smack and I can see Javi's feet are no longer planted on the ground. I look up just as Will leans over Javi and delivers another punch.</p><p>\"Will, get off him!\" Gavin yells. Gavin is pulling Will back and they both fall to the ground.</p><p>Eddie rushes to my side and pulls me upright. \"Layken, what happened?\" She has her arms around me and I'm clutching my chest. I know I was hit in the back, but it feels like my lungs are concrete. I'm gasping for air, but I can't answer her.</p><p>Will rustles out of Gavin's grip and stands up. He walks to me and takes my hand as Eddie scoots out of his way. He pulls me up and puts my arm around his shoulder, wraps his other arm around my waist and starts walking me forward.</p><p>\"I'm taking you home,\" is all he says.</p><p>\"Wait,\" Eddie yells as she circles to the front of us. \"I found your purse.\"</p><p>I reach out and take it from her and attempt to smile. Her hand goes up to her ear in the shape of a phone and she mouths 'call me.'</p><p>Will assists me into his car as I gently lean back against the seat. My lungs have refilled with air, but every breath I take feels like I've got a knife protruding from my back. I close my eyes and focus on inhaling and exhaling through my nose as we drive away.</p> <p>Neither one of us speaks. Me, because I can't. Will because-I don't know why. We drive in silence until we're almost to the Ypsilanti city limits.</p><p>Will jerks the car to the side of the road and throws it in park. He punches the steering wheel before he gets out of the car and slams the door. His figure is illuminated by the headlights of the car as he walks away from the vehicle, sporadically kicking at the ground and cursing obscenities. He finally stops and I watch as he stands loosely with his hands on his hips. His head is leaned back and he's looking at the sky, letting the snow fall on his face. He stands like this for a while until he makes his way back to the car, sits down, and calmly shuts his door. He puts the car into gear and we continue to drive in silence.</p><p>I'm able to walk, my breathing has returned to normal, and the knife in my back feels more like a lump now. Regardless, he still assists me as we walk into his house.</p><p>\"Lay down on the couch, I'll get some ice,\" he says.</p><p>I do as he says. I ease myself stomach first onto the couch and close my eyes, wondering what in the world just happened to tonight.</p><p>I feel his hand on the couch as he kneels down next to me. \"Will!\" I gasp as I open my eyes and actually see his face. \"Your eye.\" There's a trail of blood running down his neck from a gash above his eye.</p><p>\"It's fine. I'll be fine,\" he says as he leans over me. \"Do you mind?\" he asks as his hands grasp the bottom of my shirt.</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>He pulls my shirt up over my back and I feel something cold compress against my skin. He places the ice pack on top of the injury. He stands and opens the front door, shutting it behind him as he leaves.</p><p>He left. He just left without saying a word. I lay there for a few more minutes, expecting him to return right away, but he doesn't.</p><p>I roll onto my side and let the pack of ice fall onto the couch. I ease my shirt back down and prepare myself to stand up just as the door bursts open and my mother runs in.</p><p>\"Lake? Sweetie, are you okay?\" She throws her arms around me. Will walks in behind her.</p><p>\"Mom,\" I say weakly as I return her hug and cry.</p><p>\"It's fine Mom, really,\" I say as she's tucking me into my bed, asking me how my back feels for the one hundredth time in the ten minutes that I've been home.</p><p>She smiles and strokes my hair. That's what I'm going to miss the most about her. The way she strokes my hair as she looks at me with so much love in her eyes.</p><p>\"Will says you got hit in the back. Who hit you?\"</p><p>I wince as I try to push myself up against my pillow.</p><p>\"Javi. He's in my class. He was trying to punch Will but I got in the way.\"</p><p>\"Why was he trying to punch Will?\"</p><p>\"Because Will punched him. Javi walked me to my jeep when I left the club. He thought I wanted him to kiss me. I was trying to push him off of me-I couldn't get him to stop. The next thing I know Will's on top of him, punching him.\"</p><p>\"That's awful, Lake. I'm so sorry,\" she says as she leans forward and kisses my forehead.</p><p>\"It's fine, Mom. I'm fine. I just need some sleep.\"</p><p>She strokes my head again before she stands up and flicks the lights off.</p><p>\"What about Will? What's he going to do?\" she asks before she closes the door.</p><p>\"I don't know,\" I reply. Because at first, I think her question is referring to what he's going to do about Javi. But after she shuts the door, I realize she's asking what he's going to do about his job.</p><p>I lie awake for hours after that, dissecting the situation. We weren't on school grounds. He was defending me. Maybe Javi won't say anything. Will did throw the first punch, though. And the third. And the fourth. And probably would have thrown the fifth if Gavin wouldn't have walked up when he did. I try to recall every small detail of the entire night, in case I'm asked to defend his actions tomorrow.</p><p>The next day, I wake up to find Caulder in my kitchen with Kel eating cereal.</p><p>\"Hey. My brother can't take us today. Says he has something he has to do.\"</p><p>\"What does he have to do?\"</p><p>Caulder shrugs. \"I dunno. He brought your jeep home this morning. Then he left again.\" A spoonful of fruit loops goes into his mouth.</p><p>I can barely sit through my first two classes. Eddie and I spend second period writing notes back and forth. I told her everything that happened last night. Everything except for Will's poem.</p><p>I feel like I'm floating as we walk to third period. Almost like in my dreams when I'm hovering above myself, watching myself walk. I feel like I'm not in control of my actions, I'm just observing them as they are carried out. Eddie opens the door and walks in first. I follow slowly behind her as I make my way through the classroom door. Will isn't here yet. Neither is Javi. I inhale as I take my seat. The bustling of the conversation among the other classmates is briefly interrupted by a crackling over the intercom.</p><p>\"Layken Cohen, please report to administration.\"</p><p>I immediately swing around and look at Eddie. She gives me a half-hearted smile and a thumbs up. She's just as nervous as I am.</p><p>There are several people in the office when I walk in. I recognize the principal, Mr. Murphy, speaking with two men I don't recognize. When he notices me walk in, he nods and motions for me to follow him through the door. When I enter the room, Will is seated with his arms folded at the table. He doesn't look up at me. This doesn't look good.</p><p>\"Mrs. Cohen, please take a seat,\" Mr. Murphy says to me as he seats himself at the other head, opposite Will.</p><p>I choose the chair closest to me.</p><p>\"This is Mr. Chorizo, Javier's father,\" says Mr. Murphy, motioning toward the man I didn't recognize.</p><p>Mr. Chorizo is sitting across from me. He stands slightly and reaches across the table and shakes my hand.</p><p>\"This is Officer Venturelli,\" he says of the other man.</p><p>He follows suit and leans across the table, shaking my hand.</p><p>\"I'm sure you know why you're here. It is our understanding that there was an incident involving Mr. Cooper that occurred off of school grounds,\" he says, pausing in case I need to object. I don't.</p><p>\"We would appreciate it if you could tell us your version of events.\"</p><p>I glance toward Will and he gives me an ever so slight nod, letting me know he wants me to tell the truth. So I do. For fifteen minutes I explain in honest detail everything that happened last night. Everything except for Will's poem.</p><p>When I'm finished with the details and the questions have all been asked, I\u2019m released to return to class. As I get up to leave, Mr. Chorizo calls after me.</p><p>\"Ms. Cohen?\"</p><p>I turn and look at him.</p><p>\"I just want to say I'm sorry. I apologize for my son's behavior.\"</p><p>\"Thank you,\" I say. I turn and make my way back to the classroom.</p><p>A substitute is filling in for Will. She's an older lady who I've seen in the halls before, so she must also be a teacher here. I quietly take my seat. I can't think about anything other than Will, and if I'm about to be the reason he loses his job.</p><p>When the bell rings, the class begins to file out and I turn to Eddie.</p><p>\"What happened?\" she says.</p><p>I tell her what happened, and that I still don't know anything. I linger outside the classroom door for a while, waiting for Will to return but he never does. During fourth period, I realize I'm not in the state of mind to learn anything, so I give myself the rest of the day off.</p><p>When I turn onto our street, Will's car is in his driveway. I pull my jeep up to the curb and don't even bother pulling into the driveway. I throw it in park and quickly run across the street. As soon as I'm about to knock on the door, it swings open and Will is standing there with his satchel slung across his shoulder and his jacket on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"What are you doing here?\" he says with a surprised look on his face.</p><p>\"I saw your car,\" I say. \"What happened?\"</p><p>He doesn't invite me in. Instead, he walks outside and locks the door behind him.</p><p>\"I resigned. They withdrew my contract,\" he says as he walks toward his car.</p> <p>\"But you only have eight weeks left of student teaching. It wasn't your fault, Will. They can't do that!\"</p><p>He shakes his head. \"No, it's not like that. I wasn't fired. We just all thought it was best if I finished my student teaching at a different school, away from Javier. I've got a meeting with my faculty advisor in half an hour, that's where I'm headed.\"</p><p>He opens his door and removes his jacket and satchel, throwing them into the passenger seat.</p><p>\"But what about your job?\" I ask as I hold onto the door, not wanting him to shut it. I have so many questions. \"So you're saying you don't have an income now? What are you going to do?\"</p><p>He smiles at me and emerges back out of the car as he places his hands on my shoulders.</p> <p>\"Layken, calm down. I'll figure it out. But right now, I've got to go.\" He gets back inside, shuts his door, and rolls down his window.</p><p>\"If I'm not home in time, can Caulder stay with you guys after school?\"</p><p>\"Sure,\" I say.</p><p>\"We're leaving pretty early to go to my grandparents tomorrow, can you make sure he doesn't eat any sugar? He needs to get to bed early,\" he says as he slowly backs out of the driveway.</p><p>\"Sure,\" I say.</p><p>\"And Layken? Calm down.\"</p> <p>\"Sure,\" I say again.</p><p>And he's gone. Just like that.</p><p>18.</p><p>\u201cClose the laundry door</p><p>Tiptoe across the floor</p><p>Keep your clothes on</p><p>I got all that I can take</p><p>Teach me how to use</p> <p>The love that people say you made.\u201d</p><p>-The Avett Brothers, Laundry Room</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>I spend the rest of the afternoon helping my mother clean. It keeps my mind occupied. She never once asks why I'm not at school. I guess she's leaving the mundane things up to me now. When it's time to pick Caulder and Kel up, Will still isn't home. I bring both of the boys back to the house and we begin another discussion on Halloween costumes.</p><p>\"I know what I want to be now,\" Kel says to my mother.</p><p>She is folding clothes in the living room. She lays a towel on the back of the couch and looks at Kel, \u201cWhat are you going to be, Sweetie?\u201d</p><p>He smiles at her. \"Your lung cancer,\" he says.</p><p>She is so used to the things that come out of Kel's mouth, she doesn't skip a beat.</p><p>\"Oh yeah? Do they sell those at Wal-Mart?\"</p><p>\"I don\u2019t think so,\" he says as he grabs a drink out of the refrigerator. \"Maybe you could make it. I want to be a lung.\"</p><p>\"Hey,\" Caulder says. \"Can I be the other lung?\"</p><p>My mom laughs as she grabs a pen and paper off the bar and sits down. \"Well, I guess we better figure out how to sew a pair of cancerous lungs.\"</p><p>Kel and Caulder flock to her and start spitting out ideas.</p><p>\"Mom,\" I say flatly. \"You're not.\"</p><p>She looks up from her sketch at me and smiles. \"Lake, if my baby boy wants to be a cancerous lung for Halloween, then I'm going to make sure he's the best cancerous, tumor-ridden lung there is.\"</p><p>I roll my eyes and join them at the bar, writing down a list of the supplies we'll need.</p><p>After we return from the store with the supplies and materials needed for the cancerous lung costumes, Will pulls up in his driveway.</p><p>\"Will!\" Caulder runs across the street and grabs his hand, pulling him toward our house. \"Wait 'till you see this!\"</p><p>Will helps my mother and I grab the supplies out of the trunk and we all head inside.</p><p>\"Guess what we're going to be? For Halloween?\" Caulder is beaming as he stands in the kitchen, pointing at the supplies on the floor.</p><p>\"Uh...\"</p><p>\"Julia's cancer!\" Caulder says, excitedly.</p><p>Will raises his eyebrows and glances at my mother who has just returned from her bedroom with a sewing machine.</p><p>\"You only live once, right?\" She places the sewing machine on the bar.</p><p>\"She's letting us make the tumors for the lungs,\" Kel says. \"You wanna make one? I'll let you make the big one.\"</p><p>\"Uh...\"</p><p>\"Kel,\" I say. \"Will and Caulder can't help, they'll be out of town all weekend.\" I carry two of the sacks to the bar and start unpacking them.</p><p>\"Actually,\" Will replies as he grabs the other sacks off the floor. \"That was before I found out we were making lung cancer. I think we'll have to reschedule our trip.\"</p><p>Caulder runs over to Will and hugs him. \"Thanks, Will. They're gonna need to measure me while they\u2019re making it anyway. I've been growing a lot.\"</p><p>And once again, for the third time this week, we're one big happy family.</p><p>We have most of the hand drawn patterns cut and it's time to get the boys measurements. \"Where's your measuring tape?\" I ask my mother.</p><p>\"I don't know,\" she says. \"I don't know if I have one, actually.\"</p><p>\"Will has one, we can use his,\" I say. \"Will do you mind getting it?\"</p><p>\"I have measuring tape?\" he asks.</p><p>\"Yes, it's in your sewing kit,\" I say.</p><p>\"I have a sewing kit?\"</p><p>\"It's in your laundry room.\"</p><p>I can't believe he doesn't know this. I clean his house once and I can tell him where everything is better than he can? \"It's next to the sewing machine on the shelf behind your mother's patterns. I put them in chronological order according to pattern nu-nevermind,\" I say as I stand up. \"I'll just show you.\"</p><p>\"You put his patterns in chronological order?\" My mother asks, perplexed.</p><p>I turn back to her as we're headed to the door. \"I was having a bad day.\"</p><p>Will and I head across the street and I use the opportunity to ask him about what happened with his internship. I didn't want to ask him in front of Caulder, because I wasn't sure if he had said anything to him.</p><p>\"I got a slap on the wrist,\" he says as we walk inside. \"They told me since I was defending another student, they couldn\u2019t really hold it against me.\"</p><p>\"That's good. What about your internship?\" I say as I walk through the kitchen and into the laundry room where I grab the sewing kit.</p><p>\"Well, it's a little tricky. The only available ones they had are here in Ypsilanti, but they were all primary. My major is secondary, so I've been placed at a school in Detroit.\"</p><p>I pause what I'm doing and look at him.</p><p>\"What's that mean? Are y'all moving?\"</p><p>He sees the worry cross my face and he laughs. \"No, Lake, we're not moving. It's just for eight weeks. I'll be doing a lot of driving, though. I was actually going to talk to you and your mom about it later. I'm not going to be able to take the boys to school, or pick them up either. I'll be gone a lot. I know this isn't a good time to ask for your help-\"</p><p>\"Stop it.\" I grab the tape measure and return the contents into the box. \"You know we'll help.\"</p><p>Will follows me as I walk back to the laundry room and replace the sewing kit next to the sewing machine. My hand brushes against the patterns that are neatly stacked in chronological order as I recall all the cleaning and alphabetizing I did the previous weekend. Is it possible, that maybe I had a momentary lapse of sanity? I shake my head and reach over and flick off the light switch when I run into Will. He's leaning against the doorframe with his head resting against the wall. It's dark now, since I've switched off the light, but his face is slightly illuminated by the glow from the kitchen behind him.</p><p>A warm sensation flows through me as I try not to get my hopes up. He's got that look in his eyes again.</p><p>\"Last night,\" he whispers. \"When I saw Javi kissing you...\" His voice trails off and he is silent for a moment. \"I thought you were kissing him back.\"</p><p>It\u2019s hard when he's in such close proximity, but I do my best to focus and process his confession. If he thought I was allowing it to happen, then why did he pull Javi off of me? Why did he punch him? Then it hits me. Will wasn't defending me last night, he was jealous.</p><p>\"Oh,\" is all I can say.</p><p>\"I didn't know the whole story until this morning, when you told your version,\" he says as he continues to block my way; making me stand in the dark.</p><p>\u201cGod, Lake. I can't tell you how pissed I was. I wanted to hurt him so bad. And now? Now that I know he really was hurting you, I want to kill him.\" He turns away from me and rests his back against the doorframe.</p><p>I think back on last night and the emotions Will must have been experiencing. To be professing his love for me on stage one minute and then thinking I was making out with Javi the next. No wonder he was so pissed on the drive home.</p><p>He's still blocking my way. Not that I plan on running anywhere. My entire body is tense, not knowing what he\u2019s about to say or do. I try to relax as I exhale. My breathing has increased so rapidly in the last minute, my lungs are starting to ache again as the knot in my back reminds me of its presence.</p><p>\"How did you-\" I stutter. \"How'd you know I was there?\"</p><p>He turns and faces me, placing both hands on either side of the doorframe. His height and the way he has me blocked in are intimidating, but in a very good way.</p><p>\"I saw you. When I finished my piece, I saw you leaving.\"</p><p>My knees start to fail me so I place my hand on the dryer behind me for support. He knows I saw him perform. Why is he telling me this? I do my best not to get my hopes up, but maybe since he is no longer my teacher, we can finally be together. Maybe that's what he's trying to tell me.</p><p>\"Will, does this mean-\"</p><p>He takes a step toward me, leaving no space between us. His fingers brush against my cheek as he studies my face with his eyes. I place my hands against his chest as he wraps his arms around me and pulls me to him. I try to take a step away from him so I can finish my question but his body presses me against the dryer.</p><p>Just as I try to ask him again, he brings his lips to mine. I immediately stop resisting and I let him kiss me. My entire body becomes weak as my arms fall to my side and I drop the measuring tape on the floor.</p><p>He grabs my waist as he lifts me up and sets me down on top of the dryer. Our faces are even now. He kisses me like he\u2019s making up for an entire month of stolen kisses. I can't tell where my hands end and his begin as we both frantically pull at each other, our hands exploring each other's bodies. I wrap my legs around his waist and pull his mouth to my neck so I can catch my breath. All the feelings I have for him come rushing back. I try to hold back tears as I realize just how much I really do love him. Oh my god, I love him. I\u2019m in love with Will Cooper.</p><p>I no longer try to control my breathing; it would be pointless.</p><p>\"Will,\" I say as he continues exploring my neck with his lips. \"Does this mean...does it mean we don't have to pretend...anymore?\" I'm breathing so heavily I can barely form a cohesive sentence. \"We can be...together? Since you're not...since you're not my teacher?\"</p><p>His hands soften their hold on by back as his lips slowly close and pull away from my neck. I try to pull him back into me but he resists. He puts his hands on my calves and unlocks my legs from around his waist as he backs up and leans against the wall behind him, avoiding my eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My hands grip the edges of the dryer as I slide off with a jerk. \"Will?\" I say as I take a step toward him.</p><p>The light from the kitchen casts a shadow across his face but I can see his jaw-it's clenched.

Do the rules still apply?\"</p><p>He doesn't have to answer me-I can tell by his reaction that they do.</p> <p>\"Lake,\" he says quietly. \"I had a weak moment, I'm sorry.\"</p><p>I shove my hands into his chest.</p><p>\"A weak moment? That's what you call this? A weak moment?\" I yell. \"What were you gonna do, Will?

I've got more important things to think about now than your little weak moments.\"</p> <p>I cross the living room and open the front door and pause. \"Get me the measuring tape,\" I say calmly.</p><p>\"Wh-what?\" he says.</p><p>\"It's on the damn floor! Get me the measuring tape!\"</p><p>I hear his footsteps fade as he walks to the laundry room. He retrieves the measuring tape and brings it back to me. As he places it in my grasp, he squeezes my hand.</p><p>\"Don't make me the bad guy, Lake. Please.\"</p><p>I pull my hand away from his. \"Well you're certainly not the martyr, anymore.\"</p> <p>I turn and walk out, slamming the door behind me. I cross the street and don't look back to see if he's watching me. I don't care anymore.</p><p>I pause at our entryway and take a deep breath as I wipe my eyes. I open the front door to our home, put a smile across my face, and help my mother make her very last Halloween costumes.</p><p>19.</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t it like most people</p><p>I\u2019m no different</p><p>We love to talk on things</p><p>We don\u2019t know about.\u201d</p><p>-The Avett Brothers, 10,000 words</p> <p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Will and Caulder end up going out of town after all. Mom and I spend most of Saturday and Sunday putting the finishing touches on the costumes. I let my mother know about Will's schedule and how we'll be helping them out more. As pissed as I am, I don't want Caulder and Kel to have to suffer. Sunday night when Will gets home I don't even notice; because I don't even care.</p><p>\"Kel, call Caulder and tell him he can come over and put his costume on,\" I say as I drag Kel out of bed. \"Will has to leave early anyway. He can get ready over here.\"</p><p>It's Halloween, day of the cancerous lungs. Kel runs to the kitchen and grabs the phone.</p><p>I take a shower and finish getting ready, then wake my mother up so she can see the end results. After she gets dressed, under instruction from Caulder and Kel, she closes her eyes. I walk her into the living room and position her in front of the two boys.</p><p>\"Wait!\" Caulder says. \"What about Will? He needs to see us, too.\"</p><p>I usher my mother back into the hallway as I run to the front door, throw on my boots and go outside. He's pulling out of his driveway so I flag him down. I can see by the look on his face that he's hoping I've forgiven him. I immediately cease any false hope.</p><p>\"You're still an asshole, but your brother wants you to see his costume. Come in for a second.\" I return to the house.</p><p>When Will walks in I position him and my mother in front of the boys and tell them to open their eyes.</p><p>Kel is the right lung, Caulder is the left. The stuffed material is shaped so that their arms and head fit through small openings and the bottom is open to their waste and legs. We dyed the material so that it would reflect dead spots here and there. There are larger lumps protruding from the lungs in various places-the tumors. There is a long pause before Will and my mother react.</p><p>\"It's disgusting,\" Will says.</p><p>\"Repulsive,\" my mother adds.</p><p>\"Hideous,\" I say.</p><p>The boys high five. Or, rather, the lungs high five. After we take pictures, I load them up in the jeep and I drop the pair of lungs off at school.</p><p>I'm not even halfway through second period when my phone starts vibrating. I pull it out of my pocket and look at the number. It's Will. Will never calls me. I assume he's trying to apologize so I put the phone back in my jacket. It vibrates again. He's calling again. I turn and look at Eddie.</p><p>\"Will keeps calling me, should I answer?\" I say. I don't know why I'm asking her. Maybe she's got some great advice.</p><p>\"I dunno,\" she says.</p><p>Maybe not.</p><p>On his third attempt, I press the send button and put the phone to my ear. \"Hello?\" I whisper.</p><p>\"Layken, it's me. Look, you've got to get to the elementary. There's been an incident and I can't get through to your mom. I'm in Detroit, I can't go.\"</p><p>\"What? With who?\" I whisper.</p><p>\"Both of them, I guess. They aren't hurt; they just need someone to pick them up. Go! Call me back.\"</p><p>I quietly excuse myself from the classroom. Eddie follows me.</p><p>\"What is it?\" she says as we walk into the hallway.</p><p>\"I don't know. Something with Kel and Caulder,\" I say.</p><p>\"I'm going with you,\" she says.</p><p>When we arrive at the school, I sprint inside. I'm out of breath and on the verge of hysteria when we find the office. Kel and Caulder are both sitting in the lobby.</p><p>My feet won\u2019t move fast enough as I run to them and hug them.</p><p>\"Are y'all okay? What happened?\"</p><p>They both shrug.</p><p>\"We don\u2019t know,\" Kel says. \"They just told us we had to sit here until our parents came.\"</p><p>\"Ms. Cohen?\" someone says from behind me. I turn around and there is a slender woman with red hair looking at me. She's wearing a black pencil skirt and a white dress shirt. She looks more like a librarian than a principal. She gestures her hand toward her office and Eddie and I follow her.</p><p>The woman walks into her office and takes a seat at her desk, nodding to the chairs in front of her. Eddie and I both sit.</p><p>\"I'm Ms. Brill. I'm the principal here at Chapman Elementary. Principal Brill.\"</p><p>The curt way she's speaking to me and her hoity toity posture have immediately turned me off. I already don't like her.</p><p>\"Are Caulder's parents joining us?\" she asks.</p><p>\"Caulder's parents are dead,\" I reply.</p><p>She gasps, then attempts to control her reaction by sitting up even straighter. \"Oh, that's right. I'm sorry,\" she says. \"Is it his brother? He lives with his brother, right?\"</p><p>I nod. \"He's in Detroit, he can't make it. I'm Kel's sister. What's the problem?\"</p><p>She laughs. \"Well, isn't it obvious?\" She gestures out her office window to them.</p><p>I look at the boys. They're playing rock-paper-scissors and laughing. I know she's referring to their costumes, but she's already lost my respect with her attitude, so I continue to act oblivious.</p><p>\"Is rock-paper-scissors against school policy?\" I ask.</p><p>Eddie laughs.</p><p>\"Ms. Cohen,\" Principal Brill says. \"They're dressed as cancerous lungs!\" She shakes her head in disbelief.</p><p>\"I thought they were rotten kidney beans,\" Eddie says.</p><p>We both laugh.</p><p>\"I don't think this is funny,\" Principal Brill says. \"They're causing a distraction amongst the students! Those are very offensive and crude costumes! I don't know who thought it was a good idea, but you need to take them home and change their clothes.\"</p><p>My focus returns to Principal Brill as I slowly turn around and lean forward, placing my arms on her desk.</p><p>\"Principal Brill,\" I say calmly. \"Those costumes were made by my mother. My mother, who has stage four small-cell lung cancer. My mother, who will never watch her little boy celebrate another Halloween again. My mother, who will more than likely experience a year of 'lasts.' Last Christmas. Last birthday. Last Easter. And if God is willing, her last Mother's Day. My mother, who when asked by her nine-year-old son if he could be her cancer for Halloween, had no choice but to make him the best cancerous tumor-ridden lung costume she could. So if you think it's so offensive, I suggest you drive them home yourself and tell my mother to her face. Do you need my address?\"</p><p>Principal Brill's mouth is gaped open as she shakes her head. She can't respond. I stand up and Eddie follows me out the door. I stop short and spin around and walk back into her office.</p><p>\"And one more thing. The costume contest? I hope it's fairly judged.\"</p><p>Eddie laughs as I shut the door behind us.</p><p>\"What's going on?\" Kel asks.</p><p>\"Nothing,\" I say. \"Y'all can go back to class. She just wanted to know where we got the materials for your costume so she can be a hemorrhoid next year.\"</p><p>Eddie and I try to contain our laughter as the boys make their way back to class. We head outside and as soon as we open the doors, we explode. We laugh so hard, we cry.</p><p>When we get back in the jeep, I have six missed calls from my mother and two from Will. I return their calls and assure them the situation has been resolved without sparing any details.</p><p>Later that afternoon when I pick the boys up from school, they sprint to the car.</p><p>\"We won!\" Caulder yells as he climbs in the backseat. \"We both won! Fifty dollars each!\"</p><p>20.</p><p>\u201cWell I've been locking myself up in my house for some time now</p><p>Reading and writing and reading and thinking</p><p>and searching for reasons and missing the seasons</p><p>The Autumn, the Spring, the Summer, the snow</p><p>The record will stop and the record will go</p><p>Latches latched the windows down,</p><p>the dog coming in and the dog going out</p><p>Up with caffeine and down with the shot</p><p>Constantly worried about what I've got</p><p>Distracted by work but I can't make it stop</p><p>and my confidence on and my confidence off</p><p>And I sink to the bottom I rise to the top</p><p>and I think to myself that I do this a lot</p><p>World outside just goes it goes it goes it goes it goes it goes...\u201d</p><p>-The Avett Brothers, Talk on Indolence</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>The next few weeks come and go. Eddie helps out with watching the boys until Will gets home on the days I take my mother to her treatments. Will leaves every morning at six-thirty and doesn't return home until after five-thirty. We don't see each other. I make sure we don't see each other. We've resorted to texting and phone calls when it comes to Kel and Caulder. My mother has been pressing me for information, wanting to know why he doesn't come around anymore. I lie and tell her he's just busy with his new internship.</p><p>He's only been to the house once in the past two months. It was the only time we've really spoken since the incident in the laundry room. He came to tell me he was offered a job at a Junior High that starts in January.</p><p>I'm happy for him, but it's bittersweet. I know how much the job means for him and Caulder, but I know what it means for Will and I, too. Deep down there was a part of me silently counting down the days until his last day of internship. It's finally here, and he's already signed another contract. It solidified things for us, really. Solidified that they're over. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We finally put the house up for sale in Texas. Mom has managed to save almost 180,000 dollars from life insurance dad actually had. The house isn't paid off yet, but after all is said and done we should get another check from the sale. Mom and I spend the majority of November focusing on our finances. We set aside more for our college funds and she opened a savings account for Kel. She payed off all the outstanding credit cards and charge cards that are in her name, and instructed me to never open any in my own name. Said she would haunt me if I did.</p><p>Today is Thursday. It\u2019s the final day of school for all the districts; including Will\u2019s. We have early release today, so I bring Caulder home with us. He usually spends the night on Thursdays while Will goes to the slam.</p><p>I haven't been back to Club N9NE since the night Will read his poem. I understand what Javi meant in class now-about having to relive heartache. That's why I don't go. I've relived it enough for a lifetime.</p><p>I feed the boys and send them to their bedroom and then head to my mother's room for what has become our nightly chat.</p> <p>\"Shut the door, these are Kel's,\" she whispers.</p><p>She's wrapping Christmas gifts. I shut the door behind me and sit on the bed with her and help her wrap.</p><p>\"What are your plans for Christmas break?\" she asks.</p><p>She's lost all of her hair now. She chose not to go with a wig-said it felt like a ferret was taking a nap on her head. She's still beautiful, nonetheless.</p><p>I shrug. \"Whatever yours are, I guess.\"</p> <p>She frowns. \"Are you going to Will's graduation with us tomorrow?\"</p><p>He sent us an invite two weeks ago. I think each graduate gets a certain number of guests and his grandparents are the only other people he invited besides us.</p><p>\"I don't know, I haven't decided yet,\" I say.</p><p>She secures a box with a bow and sets it aside. \"You should go. Whatever happened between the two of you, you should still go. He\u2019s been there for us, Lake.\"</p><p>I don\u2019t want to admit to her that I don't want to go because I don't know how to be around him anymore. That night in his laundry room when I thought for a brief moment that we could finally be together; I had never felt so elated. It was the most amazing feeling I've ever experienced, to finally be free to love him. But it wasn't real. That one minute of pure happiness I felt and the heartache that came moments later is something I never want to experience again. I'm tired of grieving.</p><p>My mother moves the wrapping paper from her lap and reaches out and hugs me. I didn't realize I was wearing my emotions on my sleeve.</p> <p>\"I'm sorry, but I think I may have given you some terrible advice,\" she says.</p><p>I pull away from her and laugh. \"That's impossible, Mom. You don't know how to do terrible.\"</p><p>I take a box from the floor and pull it into my lap as I grab a sheet of already cut paper and begin to wrap it.</p><p>\"I did, though. Your whole life I've been telling you to think with your head, not your heart,\" she says.</p><p>I meticulously fold the edges up and grab the roll of tape. \"That's not good advice, Mom. That's great advice. That same advice is what has gotten me through these past few months.\" I tear a piece of tape and secure the edge of the package.</p><p>My mother grabs the box out of my hand before I'm finished wrapping it and sets it beside her. She takes my hands and turns me toward her.</p><p>\"I'm serious. You've been doing so much thinking with your head that you're ignoring your heart completely. There has to be a balance. The fact that both of you are letting other things consume you is about to ruin any chance you'll ever have at being happy.\"</p><p>I shake my head in confusion. \"Nothing is consuming me, Mom.\"</p> <p>She shakes my hands like I'm not getting it. \"I am, Lake. I'm consuming you. You've got to stop worrying so much about me. Go live your life. I'm not dead yet, you know.\"</p><p>I stare down at our hands as her words soak in. I have been focusing on her a lot. But that's what she needs. It's what we both need. She doesn't have that much time left, and I want to be there for every second of it.</p><p>\"Mom, you need me. You need me more than I need Will. Besides, Will has made his choice.\"</p><p>She darts her eyes away and lets go of my hands. \"No he hasn't, Lake. He made what he thought was the best choice for him, but he's wrong. You're both wrong.\"</p><p>I know she wants to see me happy. I don't have the heart to tell her that it's over between us. He made his choice that night in the laundry room when he let me go. He has his priorities, and right now I'm not one of them.</p><p>She takes the box I was wrapping and returns it in front of her and starts wrapping it again. \"That night I told you I had cancer, and you ran to Will's house?\" Her voice softens. She clears her throat, still avoiding my eyes. \"I need to tell you what he said to me, at the door.\"</p><p>I remember the conversation she's referring to but I couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying.</p><p>\"When he answered the door I told him you needed to come home. That we needed to talk about it. He looked at me with heartache in his eyes. He said, 'Let her stay Julia. She needs me right now.'</p><p>\"Lake, you broke my heart. It broke my heart that you needed him more than you needed me. As soon as the words came out of his mouth, I realized that you were grown up...that I wasn't your whole life anymore. Will could see that. He saw how bad his words hurt me. When I turned away to walk back to the house he followed me into the yard and hugged me. He told me he would never take you from me. He said he was going to let you go...let you focus on me and on the time I had left.\"</p><p>She places the wrapped gift on the bed. She scoots toward me and takes my hands in hers again. \"Lake, he didn't move on. He didn't choose this new job over you...he chose his new job over us. He wanted you to have more time with me.\"</p><p>I take a deep breath as I absorb everything my mother just revealed. Is she right? Does he really love me enough that he would be willing to let me go?</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d My voice is weak. \u201cWhat if you\u2019re wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019m not wrong, Lake? Question everything. What if he wants to choose you? You\u2019ll never know if you don\u2019t tell him how you feel. You\u2019ve completely shut him out. You haven\u2019t given him the chance to pick you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right, I haven\u2019t. I\u2019ve been completely closed off since that night in the laundry room. Maybe he just needs to know it\u2019s okay. I need to let him know that it\u2019s okay for him to love me.</p><p>\"It's seven-thirty, Lake. You know where he is. Go tell him how you feel.\"</p><p>I don't move. My legs feel like jell-o.</p><p>\"Go!\" she laughs.</p><p>I jump off the bed and run to my room. My hands are shaking and my thoughts are all jumbled together while I throw on my pants. I put on the purple shirt that I wore on our first and only date. I go to the bathroom and inspect my reflection.</p><p>There's something missing. I run to my room and reach under my pillow and pull out the purple clip. I snap it open and remove my mother's strands of hair and place them in my jewelry box. I go back to the bathroom and brush my bangs to the side of my head and snap the clip in place.</p><p>21.</p><p>\u201cDon't say it's over</p><p>\u2018Cause that's the worst news I</p><p>could hear I swear that I will</p><p>Do my best to be here</p><p>just the way you like it</p><p>Even though it\u2019s hard to hide</p><p>Push my feelings all aside</p><p>I will rearrange my plans and</p><p>change for you.\u201d</p><p>-The Avett Brothers, If it\u2019s the Beaches</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>When I walk into the club, I don't stop to look for him. I know he's here. I don't give myself time to second guess anything as I walk with false confidence toward the front of the room. The emcee is announcing scores for the previous performer when I walk onto the stage. He's apprehensive as I grab the microphone from him and turn toward the audience. The lights are so bright, I can't see anyone's faces. I can't see Will.</p><p>\"I would like to perform a piece I wrote,\" I say into the microphone. My voice is steady, but my heart is about to jump out of my chest. I can't turn back now. I have to do this. \"I know this isn't standard protocol, but it's an emergency,\" I say.</p><p>Laughter overcomes the audience. The rumble of the crowd is loud, causing me to freeze at the thought of what I'm about to do. I start to have second thoughts and turn around to the emcee but he nudges me back and gives me the go ahead.</p><p>I place the microphone in the stand and position it down to my height. I close my eyes and take a deep breath before I begin.</p><p>\"Three dollars!\" someone yells from the audience.</p><p>I open my eyes and realize I haven't paid my fee yet. I frantically dig my hands in my pockets and pull out a five dollar bill and walk it over to the emcee.</p><p>I return to the microphone and close my eyes.</p><p>\"My piece is called-\"</p><p>Someone's tapping me on the shoulder. I open my eyes and turn around to see the emcee holding two one-dollar bills up.</p><p>\"Your change,\" he says.</p><p>I take the money and put it back in my pocket. He's still standing there.</p><p>\"Go!\" I whisper through clenched teeth.</p><p>He stammers and walks off the stage.</p><p>Once again, I turn toward the microphone and begin to speak. \"My piece is called Schooled,\" I say into the microphone. My voice is shaking, so I take a few deep breaths. I just hope I can remember it, I re-wrote a few lines on the way here. I inhale one last time and begin.</p><p>I got schooled this year.</p><p>By everyone.</p><p>By my little brother...</p><p>by The Avett Brothers...</p><p>by my mother, my best friend, my teacher, my father,</p><p>a boy that I'm seriously, deeply, madly, incredibly, and undeniably in love with...</p><p>I got so schooled this year.</p><p>By a nine-year-old.</p><p>He taught me that it's okay to live life</p><p>a little backwards.</p><p>And how to laugh</p><p>At what you would think</p><p>is un-laughable.</p><p>I got schooled this year</p><p>By a Band!</p><p>They taught me how to find that feeling of feeling again.</p><p>They taught me how to decide what to be</p><p>And go be it.</p><p>I got schooled this year.</p><p>By a cancer patient.</p><p>She taught me so much. She's still teaching me so much.</p><p>She taught me to question.</p><p>To never regret.</p><p>She taught me to push my boundaries,</p><p>Because that's what they're there for.</p><p>She told me to find a balance between head and heart</p><p>And then</p><p>she taught me how...</p><p>I got schooled this year</p><p>By a Foster Kid</p><p>She taught me to respect the hand that I was dealt.</p><p>And to be grateful I was even dealt a hand.</p><p>She taught me that family</p><p>Doesn't have to be blood.</p><p>Sometimes your family</p><p>are your friends.</p><p>I got schooled this year</p><p>By my teacher</p><p>He taught me</p><p>That the points are not the point,</p><p>The point is poetry...</p><p>I got schooled this year</p><p>By my father.</p><p>He taught me that hero's aren't always invincible</p><p>And that the magic</p><p>is within me..</p><p>I got schooled this year</p><p>Boy.</p><p>a boy that I'm seriously, deeply, madly, incredibly, and undeniably in love with.</p><p>And he taught me the most important thing of all...</p><p>To put the emphasis</p><p>On life.</p><p>The feeling that comes over you, when you're in front of an audience? All those people craving for your words, yearning to see a glimpse into your soul...it's exhilarating. I thrust the microphone back into the emcee's hands and run off the stage. I look around but don't see him anywhere. I look at the booth we sat in on our first date, but it's empty. I realize, after standing there, waiting to be swept off of my feet-that he's not even here. I spin around in a circle, scanning the room a second time. A third time. He's not here. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The same fleeting feeling I had on that stage, on his dryer, in the booth in the back of the room-it's gone. I can't do it again. I want to run. I need air. I need to feel the Michigan air against my face.</p><p>I throw open the door and take a step outside when a voice, amplified through the speakers, stops me in my tracks.</p><p>\"That's not a good idea,\" he says into the microphone. I recognize his voice, and that repetitive phrase.</p><p>I slowly turn around and face the stage. Will is standing there, holding the microphone between his hands, looking directly at me.</p> <p>\"You shouldn't leave before you get your scores,\" he says as he motions to the judges table. I follow his gaze to the judges who are all turned around in their seats. All four of them have their eyes locked on me; the fifth seat is empty. I gasp as I realize Will was the fifth judge.</p><p>So he saw me. He watched me do my piece.</p><p>I sense that I'm floating again as I make my way to the center of the room. Everyone is quiet. I look around and all eyes are on me. No one understands what's happening. I'm not so sure I even understand what's happening.</p><p>Will looks at the emcee standing next to him. \"I'd like to perform a piece. It's an emergency,\" he says.</p><p>The emcee backs away and gives Will the go ahead. Will turns back to face me.</p> <p>\"Three dollars,\" someone yells from the crowd.</p><p>Will darts a look at the emcee. \"I don't have any cash,\" he says.</p><p>I immediately pull the two dollars in change out of my pocket and run to the stage, smacking it down in front of the emcees feet. He inspects the money I laid before him.</p><p>\"Still a dollar short,\" the emcee says.</p><p>The silence in the room is interrupted as several chairs slide from under their tables. There is a faint rumble as people walk toward me. I'm surrounded, being pushed and shoved in different directions as the crowd grows thicker. It begins to disperse just as fast and the silence slowly returns as everyone makes their way back to their seats. I return my gaze to the stage, where dozens of dollar bills are haphazardly thrown at the emcees feet. My eyes follow along as a quarter rolls off the edge of the stage and falls onto the floor. It wiggles and spins as it comes to rest at my foot.</p><p>The emcee is focused on the pile of money before him. \"Okay,\" he says. \"I guess that covers it. What's the name of your piece, Will?\"</p> <p>Will brings the microphone to his mouth and finds me in the crowd. \"Better than third,\" he says.</p><p>I met a girl in a U-Haul.</p><p>A beautiful girl</p><p>And I fell for her.</p><p>I fell hard.</p><p>Unfortunately, sometimes life gets in the way.</p><p>Life definitely got in my way.</p><p>It got all up in my damn way,</p> <p>Life blocked the door with a stack of wooden 2x4's nailed together and attached to a fifteen inch concrete wall behind a row of solid steel bars, bolted to a titanium frame that no matter how hard I shoved against it-</p><p>It</p><p>wouldn't</p><p>Sometimes life doesn't budge.</p><p>It just gets all up in your damn way.</p><p>It blocked my plans, my dreams, my desires, my wishes, my wants, my needs.</p><p>It blocked out that beautiful girl</p><p>That I fell so hard for.</p><p>Life tries to tell you what's best for you</p><p>What should be most important to you</p><p>What should come in first</p><p>Or second</p><p>Or third.</p><p>I tried so hard to keep it all organized, alphabetized, stacked in chronological order, everything in its perfect space, its perfect place.</p><p>I thought that's what life wanted me to do.</p><p>This is what life needed for me to do.</p><p>Right?</p><p>Keep it all in sequence?</p><p>Sometimes, life gets in your way.</p><p>It gets all up in your damn way.</p><p>But it doesn't get all up in your damn way because it wants you to just give up and let it take control. Life doesn't get all up in your damn way because it just wants you to hand it all over and be carried along.</p><p>Life wants you to fight it.</p><p>Learn how to make it your own.</p><p>It wants you to grab an axe and hack through the wood.</p><p>It wants you to get a sledgehammer and break through the concrete.</p><p>It wants you to grab a torch and burn through the metal and steel until you can reach through and grab it.</p><p>Life wants you to grab all the organized, the alphabetized, the chronological, the sequenced. It wants you to mix it all together,</p><p>stir it up,</p><p>blend it.</p><p>Life doesn't want you to let it tell you that your little brother should be the only thing that comes first.</p><p>Life doesn't want you to let it tell you that your career and your education should be the only thing that comes in second.</p><p>And life definitely doesn't want me</p><p>To just let it tell me</p><p>that the girl I met,</p><p>The beautiful, strong, amazing, resilient girl</p><p>That I fell so hard for</p><p>Should only come in third.</p><p>Life knows.</p><p>Life is trying to tell me</p><p>That the girl I love,</p><p>The girl I fell</p><p>So hard for?</p><p>There's room for her in first.</p><p>I'm putting her first.</p><p>Will sets the microphone down and jumps off the stage as he walks up to me. I've gone so long teaching myself how to let go of him, to break the hold he has on me. It hasn't worked. It hasn't worked a damn bit.</p><p>He takes my face in his hands and wipes my tears away with his thumbs. \"I love you, Lake,\" he smiles as he presses his forehead against mine. \"You deserve to come first.\"</p><p>Everyone and everything else in the entire room fades; the only sound I hear is the crash of the walls I've built up around me as they crumble to the ground.</p><p>\"I love you, too. I love you so much,\" I say. He brings his lips to mine and I throw my arms around him and kiss him back. Of course I kiss him back.</p><p>The End.</p><p>Epilogue:</p><p>\u201cBut when I think</p><p>I just might get something</p><p>Out of this</p><p>My parents taught me to learn</p><p>When I miss</p><p>Just do your best</p><p>Just do your best.\u201d</p><p>-The Avett Brothers, When I drink</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>I walk around the living room, taking long leaps over mounds of toys as I gather wrapping paper and stuff it into the sack. \"Did y'all like your presents?\" I ask.</p><p>\"Yes!\" Kel and Caulder yell in unison. I gather the last of the wrapping paper and tie the ends of the trash bag together and head outside to throw it away.</p><p>As I'm walking to the curb, Will emerges from his house and jogs toward me.</p><p>\"Let me get that, Babe,\" he says as he takes the bag out of my hands and carries it to the curb. He walks back to where I'm standing and puts his arms around me, nuzzling his face in my neck.</p><p>\"Merry Christmas,\" he says.</p><p>\"Merry Christmas,\" I reply.</p><p>It's our second Christmas together. The first without my mother. She passed away in September this year, almost a year to the day that we moved to Michigan. It was hard. It was extremely hard.</p><p>When someone close to you dies, the memories and recollections of them are painful. It isn't until the fifth stage of grief that the memories of them stop hurting as much; when the recollections become positive. When you stop thinking about the person's death, and remember all of the wonderful things about their life.</p><p>Having Will by my side has made it bearable. After graduation, he applied to get his Master's in Education. He didn't take the job at the Junior High after all. Instead, he lived off of student loans for another semester until I graduated.</p><p>Will takes my hand as we walk back inside the house. The amount of toys that are piled in my living room floor is astonishing.</p><p>\"I'll be back, last load,\" Will says as he takes a stack of Caulder's things and walks back out the front door. This is his third trip across the street, transferring all of Caulder's new toys to their house.</p><p>\"Kel, these can't all be yours,\" I say as I scan the living room. \"Y'all start gathering them up and take them to the spare bedroom. I need to vacuum.\" There are small remnants of gift chaos all over the living room floor.</p><p>After I finish vacuuming, I wrap up the cord and return the vacuum to the hallway closet. Will walks in the front door with two gift sacks in hand.</p><p>\"Uh, oh. How'd we forget those?\" I ask just before I call the boys into the living room.</p><p>\"These aren't for the boys. These are for you and Kel.\" He walks to the couch and motions for Kel and I to take a seat.</p><p>\"Will, you didn't have to do this. You already got me Avett Brothers tickets,\" I say as I settle into the sofa.</p><p>He hands the sacks to us and kisses me on the forehead. \"I didn't. They aren't from me.\"</p><p>He takes Caulder's hand and they quietly slip out the front door. I look at Kel and he just shrugs.</p><p>We simultaneously rip the tissue out of the sacks and pull out envelopes. \"Lake\" is sprawled across the front in my mother's handwriting.</p><p>My hands are weak as I slide the paper out of the envelope. I run my arm across my eyes and wipe away my tears as I unfold my letter.</p><p>To my babies,</p><p>Merry Christmas. I'm sorry if these letters have caught you both by surprise. There is just so much more I have to say. I know you thought I was done giving advice, but I couldn't leave without reiterating a few things in writing. You may not relate to these things now, but someday you will. I wasn't able to be around forever, but I hope that my words can be.</p><p>-Don't stop making basagna. Basagna is good. Wait until a day when there is no bad news, and bake a damn basagna.</p><p>-Find a balance between head and heart. Hopefully you've found that Lake, and you can help Kel sort it out when he gets to that point.</p><p>-Push your boundaries, that's what they're there for.</p><p>-I'm stealing this snippet from your favorite band, Lake. \"Always remember there is nothing worth sharing, like the love that let us share our name.\"</p><p>-Don't take life too seriously. Punch it in the face when it needs a good hit. Laugh at it.</p><p>-And Laugh a lot. Never go a day without laughing at least once.</p><p>-Never judge others. You both know good and well how unexpected events can change who a person is. Always keep that in mind. You never know what someone else is experiencing within their own life.</p><p>-Question everything. Your love, your religion, your passions. If you don't have questions, you'll never find answers.</p><p>-Be accepting. Of everything. People's differences, their similarities, their choices, their personalities. Sometimes it takes a variety to make a good collection. The same goes for people.</p><p>-Choose your battles, but don't choose very many.</p><p>-Keep an open mind; it's the only way new things can get in.</p><p>-And last but not least, not the tiniest bit least. Never regret.</p><p>Thank you both for giving me the best years of my life.</p><p>Especially the last one.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Mom </p> </body></html>"]
