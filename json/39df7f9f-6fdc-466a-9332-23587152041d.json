Because his lifestyle is a bit wild, this novella will contain explicit language and adult content.</p><p>If you like a bad boy, you\u2019ll love Dominic. I\u2019ve always found this to be true: The badder they are, the harder they fall. Dominic will prove this notion in BEFORE WE FALL. He\u2019ll fall hard....eventually.</p> <p>But until then, he\u2019s immersed in his bad boy ways. I hope you enjoy UNTIL WE BURN.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>\u201cHarder,\u201d the girl whispers. Obligingly, I slap her ass again. Hard.</p><p>The stinging sound echoes through the night, rippling through the silence of Mount Lee. A hundred feet below, the giant letters of the Hollywood sign gleam ghostly white in the darkness.</p><p>I smile against the back of the girl\u2019s pale neck and bite it. Hard.</p> <p>My teeth sink into her soft flesh, but she likes it. She moans, twisting around so that she can clutch at my chest, twisting her fingers in my tux jacket.</p><p>\u201cDominic,\u201d she sighs. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m here with you right now. Dominic Kinkaide is slapping my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDominic Kinkaide is doing more than that to your ass,\u201d I point out, remembering how I\u2019d just pulled out of it a minute ago, how I\u2019d rolled off the condom and flicked it away.</p><p>As the coatcheck girl from the black gala event I\u2019d just vacated, she probably had no idea when her evening started that it was going to end like this: with quick, hard anal sex in public....with me.</p><p>Even though it\u2019s two a.m. and it\u2019s unlikely that anyone will be hiking up Hollywood Ridge Trail, the knowledge that they could, the knowledge that strangers might stumble upon us and find us in this intimate situation, turned me on quicker than anything.</p><p>I finished what I set out to do within a few minutes and now, I pull away and adjust my clothes as the girl pulls at her own.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know her name.</p><p>Her name doesn\u2019t matter.</p><p>The girl looks up at me, batting her eyelashes. \u201cThat was nice. If you want to... you know, um, actually sleep with me, call me, okay? I\u2019ll give you my number.\u201d</p><p>I look at her in amusement. \u201cActually sleep with you?\u201d</p><p>She looks embarrassed. \u201cI don\u2019t mean like... sleep in my bed overnight. I mean, real sex. Not just... what we did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnal?\u201d I raise an eyebrow. We\u2019re both adults here. We can call a spade a spade.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she manages to say, her cheeks flushed. \u201cAnal. That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever done that, by the way.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what they all say and I have a hard time believing it. This is the twenty-first century after all. I grin at her though, deciding to humor her.</p> <p>\u201cAnd? What\u2019d you think?\u201d</p><p>She bats her eyelashes again, coy now, laying her hand against my chest. \u201cI think that you can do anything you want with me,\u201d she purrs.</p><p>I fight to not roll my eyes at her sticky-sweet tone now. She\u2019s too compliant, too needy, too willing to do anything at all that I ask of her. Why the fuck are they always like this? Are they so desperate to sleep with someone famous, even one single time, that they\u2019ll do anything for it?</p><p>Nine times out of ten, the answer is yes.</p><p>And nine times out of ten, I capitalize on that. I\u2019d be an idiot if I didn\u2019t.</p><p>But to be honest, the whole thing is getting tiresome. I\u2019m weary of it. I\u2019m weary of the shallow people, I\u2019m weary of people using other people, I\u2019m weary of easy women who constantly throw themselves at me.</p><p>They only want to say \u201cI was with Dominic Kinkaide.\u201d They want to claim a tiny piece of me, no matter how small that piece or moment was.</p><p>In this case, Coatcheck Girl will be able to say that she claimed ten minutes of my time. But from the look on her face, the wonderstruck expression, that ten minutes was enough.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t Amy be mad at you?\u201d she asks curiously as she runs her fingers through her tangled hair in the dark. She doesn\u2019t sound concerned as she mentions the woman that most people assume is my girlfriend.</p><p>I shake my head at thought of Amy Ashby, a woman whose fame is equal to my own, a woman whose jaded outlook on life surpasses even my own. She\u2019s beautiful, successful and savvy.</p><p>She\u2019s also a cold-hearted bitch. It\u2019s one of things I like about her.</p><p>\u201cFor one thing, Amy and I aren\u2019t exclusive,\u201d I answer, turning to walk back toward my car. \u201cAnd for the other, it\u2019s not your business.\u201d</p><p>My voice is cool now. I\u2019m not rude, just matter of fact. It\u2019s just a way of my life. I have to constantly try to keep people at arm\u2019s length, out of reach and out of my business. It\u2019s a full-time job. Actually, it\u2019s several people\u2019s full-time jobs. I employ an entire staff of publicity people for this very reason.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d I ask politely, holding out my elbow to the girl. I\u2019m a gentleman now, something that women adore about me.</p><p>I\u2019m an actor. I can be whatever they want me to be, I morph into whatever role I\u2019m playing, whether I\u2019m on-screen or off. On-screen, I\u2019ve been a serial killer, rapist, romantic, misunderstood, vampire and poet.</p><p>Off-screen, the role I play the best is that of an asshole.</p><p>The girl smiles up at me now and I can see that this one simple gesture took the sting out of me telling her to mind her own business.</p><p>\u201cWill you call me?\u201d she asks hesitantly as I help her into my slate gray Porsche.</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d I answer honestly as I close her door, still the gentleman. Gentlemen are polite. Gentlemen use manners and most importantly, gentlemen are honest. I\u2019m almost always honest.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d she stares at me as drop into the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d I nod. \u201cNot because I won\u2019t want to, but because this isn\u2019t the kind of life that would be good for you. If you were linked to me in any way, the press would hunt you down, stalk you, photograph you, and pretty much drive you insane. Trust me, it\u2019s for your own good. I won\u2019t call you because I want to you protect you from that.\u201d</p><p>Lie.</p><p>Okay, fine. I\u2019m not always honest.</p><p>And I\u2019m not always a gentleman.</p><p>I stare at the road in front of me as I drive down the winding trail. The engine of my 911 revs around each curve as the tires hug the road.</p><p>\u201cOK. That makes sense,\u201d the girl nods, buying every bit of my line of shit. \u201cWell then, can I call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat probably wouldn\u2019t be a good idea either,\u201d I answer bluntly. \u201cBut it was nice being together tonight, wasn\u2019t it? I had fun.\u201d</p><p>From my periphery, I see her shoulders slump as she realizes what I\u2019m saying. But what the fuck did she expect? She handed me my coat and offered herself to me on a platter. Did she expect a long-term relationship?</p><p>\u201cOh well,\u201d she says with forced brightness. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It was fun. Can I at least have an autograph?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I tell her. \u201cIt would be my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, after we glide to a stop outside of the Shangri-La hotel where she works, I scribble my name on a piece of paper and hand it to her.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dominic,\u201d she murmurs, staring me in the eye. \u201cIf you change your mind, you know where to find me.\u201d</p><p>I nod and she gets out. I barely glance in her direction before I drive away, although I know that she\u2019s standing on the sidewalk watching me disappear into traffic. They always do.</p><p>Deep down, I should feel guilty. I should feel bad. And once in a while, every once in a blue moon, I do. But then I stomp the shit out of that emotion and put it out of my mind.</p><p>These girls throw themselves at me, not the other way around.</p><p>I\u2019m only giving them what they want.</p><p>It\u2019s a public service, really.</p><p>But none of them, not one, will ever see the real Dominic Kinkaide. In fact, I\u2019m not even sure that he exists anymore.</p><p>I might\u2019ve been successful in drowning out his existence in a barrage of women, kink and whiskey.</p><p>As I drive toward my home overlooking Hollywood Hills, my phone buzzes in my pocket. Pulling it out, I see Amy Ashby\u2019s name flash on the screen.</p><p>I sigh, debating whether or not to answer it.</p><p>Yes, she understands me... or at least, the part of me that is like her. The part that has to shield itself from the public. And yes, I like that she\u2019s bitchy and tough. I admire it because I always know where she stands. But sometimes, like tonight, I\u2019m just not in the mood for it.</p><p>I answer the call anyway.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave the gala so fast?\u201d Amy complains into the phone, forgoing a greeting. \u201cI wanted to ride home with you. My brother was boring me.\u201d</p><p>Amy\u2019s older brother Sam was the host of the event tonight, in an effort to raise money for autism. He\u2019s as different from Amy as he can be: kind, considerate and normal. Because of those things, he\u2019s not in show business.</p><p>I shake my head, although she can\u2019t even see me. \u201cBecause I was tired of the whole thing,\u201d I answer, not mentioning the coat check girl. \u201cYou could\u2019ve left with me.\u201d</p><p>Lie. Amy\u2019s a freak in the sack, but she wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed being with a coat-check girl. She likes to think she has standards. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sniffs. \u201cWhatever. Come over. I want to see you.\u201d</p><p>I open my garage door. \u201cNope. I just got home and I don\u2019t want to go back out. You can come here, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause while she considers it. Finally she sighs.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. I\u2019ve got an early call tomorrow. I don\u2019t want to be a bitch on-set.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo?\u201d I ask in mock surprise. \u201cAmy Ashby doesn\u2019t want to be a bitch?\u201d She laughs, a husky contrived sound.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve changed my mind. I\u2019m coming over and I\u2019ll be a bitch tonight for you. I know how you like it. Which riding crop should I bring? The leather or the red velvet?\u201d</p><p>A thrill goes through me at the thought... of being tied up and of Amy Ashby whipping the shit out of me right before she goes down on me.</p><p>It\u2019s our favorite thing to do together.</p><p>\u201cThe red velvet,\u201d I answer curtly. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in twenty minutes. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOn my way,\u201d she purrs.</p><p>I enter my lavish house and disarm the alarm, before grabbing a tumbler of whiskey and heading out to the back veranda.</p><p>As I stand looking down on Hollywood, I ponder my life.</p><p>It\u2019s not what it was supposed to be. In high school, this wasn\u2019t what I had in mind when I pictured myself as a grown up. But here I am, at the mature age of twenty-four and I feel like I\u2019ve aged a hundred years. I feel as though everything that could\u2019ve possibly happened to me in life has happened.</p><p>And it\u2019s left its mark. I\u2019ve got so many marks and scars hidden beneath my surface that I can\u2019t even name them all.</p><p>But that\u2019s all right. I don\u2019t need to name them all. I need to shove them away and forget about them, like I always do. I need to mask them in a wild kinky night of S&amp;M with Hollywood\u2019s favorite starlet.</p> <p>In the morning, we\u2019ll go about our lives as normal, both of us pretending to be what we\u2019re not: normal, well-rounded people.</p><p>The pretense is how we survive.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>I duck in the back of my favorite restaurant, Providence, and make my way to my regular table. It\u2019s in the back, in the shadows, and that\u2019s just the way I like it.</p><p>I\u2019m different from most of the people I know who eat here. Most celebrities like to make an entrance through the front because they enjoy how the fans rush up to them, surrounding them with pleas for autographs or pictures.</p><p>Not me.</p><p>That\u2019s never been me.</p><p>I\u2019ve barely slid into my booth before a waitress slinks over to me, her bright green eyes lighting up as she sees me.</p> <p>\u201cDominic,\u201d she exclaims, wrapping an arm around my shoulders and squeezing. I grin up at her, genuinely pleased to see her. Since she\u2019s one of the only women who have ever turned me down, I shouldn\u2019t be so partial to her.</p><p>But that\u2019s not the case. I actually like her.</p><p>\u201cHey Alex.\u201d</p><p>She glances around me. \u201cWhere\u2019s Miss Ashby? Should I watch for her?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, remembering how I spent most of the night tied up in silk cords and getting my ass beat by her. She\u2019d slipped out of my house before nine a.m.</p><p>\u201cNope. She\u2019s at work today. I\u2019m here on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the way I like it,\u201d Alex announces smirking. She sits across the table from me, comfortable now that she knows Amy isn\u2019t coming. \u201cHow are things? I haven\u2019t seen you in a couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy. Just wrapped production, and I have a couple of weeks before the next film starts. I\u2019m thinking about going to my brother\u2019s for a weekend or so. It\u2019d be nice to go home for a few days.\u201d</p><p>Alex shakes her head. \u201cYou know that your family has been blessed by the Gods, right? I mean, you\u2019re gorgeous, sexy as hell and you\u2019ve got the freaking world on a string, Dominic. Your brothers are in the most famous band in the world and so you\u2019ve got a built-in soundtrack to your life if you want it.\u201d</p><p>I have to laugh at that. \u201cOh really? You think that the Devil\u2019s Own will just stop what they\u2019re doing and write some songs for me? Not hardly. I love my brothers, but Sin and Duncan aren\u2019t going to interrupt a tour schedule just for me. But you\u2019re right. I\u2019ve been blessed and I need to remember that.\u201d</p><p>I pick up my menu, even though I know exactly what it says. As I peruse the food offering, Alex stares at me, her brow furrowed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you, dude? You don\u2019t seem like yourself. You seem...off.\u201d</p><p>I laugh again. \u201cI am off. I\u2019ve been off for a long time, but nothing\u2019s wrong. I\u2019m just feeling a bit tired. I think going home to Chicago will be good for me. It\u2019ll recharge my batteries, so to speak.\u201d</p><p>Alex continues to examine me, her head cocked. \u201cOkay. If you say so. But if you want anyone to talk to someone who won\u2019t just tell you what you want to hear, you know you can talk to me. I\u2019m not concerned with sleeping with you, so I\u2019ll always be honest with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got that right,\u201d I tell her wryly. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been concerned with sleeping with me.\u201d</p><p>She taps her wedding ring. \u201cSorry, dude. You\u2019re hot and all, but I\u2019m one of the few out there who believes that marriage is sacred. Well, there are only a few here in LA. I\u2019m sure that there are plenty more like me out in the real world. But we Angelinos are a different breed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue story,\u201d I agree. \u201cI\u2019ll have the fish tacos.\u201d I fold up the menu and hand it to her. \u201cThanks, Alex.\u201d</p><p>And by thanks, I mean for offering to listen to me. I do appreciate it. She\u2019s one of the few decent people I\u2019ve met out here.</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d</p><p>She trots off to the kitchen and I\u2019m left alone once again.</p><p>But only for a few minutes.</p><p>The hostess, a bleached blonde Barbie-type makes her way over to me a short time later, trying to act casual but I feel sure that she\u2019d bee-lined her way to me as soon as she saw that I was here. She always does.</p><p>\u201cDominic,\u201d she purrs, snaking her skinny arm around my shoulders. Unlike when Alex did it, I\u2019m not enjoying this girl\u2019s touch. I shrug out of her grasp.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I answer coolly.</p><p>I\u2019m not trying to be rude, but she\u2019s always annoyed me. She\u2019s an opportunist. She\u2019s trying to make it in the acting world and I know she\u2019d probably take down her own grandmother to get a leg up. Given how poor her acting skills are when she pretends to be casual around me, I don\u2019t think she should quit her day job.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you alone?\u201d she asks bluntly, her lips almost grazing my ear. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve got something important to discuss with you.\u201d</p><p>I arch an eyebrow. \u201cOh, really? And that is?\u201d</p><p>She whispers into my ear. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to discuss this kind of thing here, but I have a question about the industry.\u201d</p><p>And by industry, she of course means the acting world.</p><p>I sigh.</p><p>\u201cOkay, shoot,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cHow can I go about getting your agent?\u201d She asks seriously, her eyes burning into mine with intensity.</p><p>\u201cTally?\u201d I ask in surprise. \u201cHe\u2019s got a waiting list ten miles long. He was a friend of my father\u2019s and that\u2019s the only reason why he took me on a few years back.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me dubiously. \u201cSo there\u2019s no way whatsoever that I could get you to put a good word in for me?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a light in her eyes now, a particular sexual light that I\u2019ve seen in a thousand women\u2019s eyes. I stare back, unfazed.</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing I can do?\u201d she asks again, her hands trailing from my shoulders down my back and wrapping around to my lap, lightly tracing my crotch. \u201cCan I try?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cGo for it.\u201d</p><p>The hostess glances around, sees that no one is near, and immediately drops to her knees and crawls under the table. I\u2019m startled for a mere second, then as her deft hands unfasten my pants and stroke at me, I allow all cognitive thought to leave my mind. When her mouth replaces her hands, logical thought disappears and I close my eyes.</p><p>Her hands are cold as she cups my balls, but her lips are warm.</p><p>Her breath is hot.</p><p>And her tongue teases the tip of my dick.</p><p>I fight back the urge to moan. She\u2019s hidden by the tablecloth, so it would look odd if anyone happened to notice me moaning to myself in the middle of a restaurant.</p><p>Christ. I despise women like this, but at the same time, I can\u2019t dismiss their merit. It\u2019s nice to get blown in the middle of the day, in the middle of Providence.</p><p>Sometimes, it pays to be Dominic Kinkaide.</p><p>\u201cHey, Melanie hasn\u2019t bothered you yet, has she?\u201d Alex demands, appearing out of nowhere. My eyes snap open and I fight to act normal, which is hard since a very key part of me is buried in Melanie\u2019s throat at this very minute.</p><p>Melanie tightens her grasp on my balls, as she\u2019s perfectly able to hear every word that Alex says.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Stupid chick keeps wanting to assault you... get you to help her out. Just ignore her, Dominic. She\u2019s ridiculous. I have better acting skills than she does. And I\u2019m not an actor.\u201d</p><p>Melanie\u2019s claws grip me tighter and I grimace. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t seen her,\u201d I lie to Alex, praying that Alex doesn\u2019t decide to sit down and chat again.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she says in satisfaction. \u201cI told her to leave you alone. I guess she listened to me for once. If she bothers you, let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a bother,\u201d I assure Alex. Because she\u2019s not...right now. Alex nods.</p><p>\u201cYour food will be up in a second,\u201d she tells me before walking away.</p> <p>After she leaves, Melanie finishes sucking me off in record time and climbs back out from under the table, wiping her mouth daintily.</p><p>\u201cThat chick is a bitch,\u201d Melanie growls to me. \u201cShe has no idea what kind of talent I have. But you do. Now. Can you please put in a word with Tally for me?\u201d</p><p>She stares at me, her hard eyes turning soft for just a brief minute, long enough to give me a glimpse into her life. She\u2019s vulnerable and insecure beneath her hard surface. Just another reason why she shouldn\u2019t be in my world.</p><p>Girls like her get eaten up and spit out.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI\u2019ll say something to him.\u201d</p> <p>Lie.</p><p>But Melanie takes me at my word and bends to squeeze my shoulders once again. She walks away and I watch her hips swish as she goes.</p><p>She\u2019s barely out of my sight when Alex returns with my lunch, switching one service (Melanie\u2019s blow job) for another: my lunch.</p><p>It\u2019s how my life works.</p><p>Everything is easy. Everyone strives to please me. Everything is just so fucking smooth. Now. It wasn\u2019t always that way, of course, but the past is the past. I don\u2019t dwell on it. In fact, I do everything I can to forget it.</p><p>For a second, I wrap my fingers around the necklace in my pocket, the one thing I allow myself to have from my previous life. It serves as a constant reminder for me.</p> <p>To never trust anyone again.</p><p>I release the pendant and grip my fork instead, chewing each bite of food efficiently and quickly, returning to the Dominic Kinkaide that the world knows and loves.</p><p>Mysterious, detached, sexy.</p><p>Those are words that have often been used to describe me. But the one word that suits me most of all has never been uttered, never even been hinted at... because no one knows.</p><p>That word is broken.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cNo fucking way, \u201cI mutter to Tally. \u201cI\u2019m not going to London. I only have a month until the new production begins. I want to relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can relax in London while they take your pictures for the promos. I also set up a day of shooting for a Tag Heuer commercial while you\u2019re there. You love their watches.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t even wear a watch,\u201d I grumble into the phone, pouring a cup of coffee with one hand as I stand completely nude in the middle of my kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou will for a million dollars,\u201d Tally says cheerfully. \u201cIt\u2019s an easy day\u2019s work for you. Their VP of marketing is a good friend of mine and I owed him a favor. Just do this for me, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. But you know I hate endorsing shit,\u201d I growl. \u201cUnless Porsche needs a spokesman, no more endorsements. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d Tally replies. \u201cYour plane will be wheels up tonight at seven pm. Amy can\u2019t make the flight with you, but she\u2019ll meet you there. They\u2019re going to work her into the promos at the same time so they can wrap it all up in two days.\u201d</p><p>I glance at the clock. Eleven am. I\u2019ve got to be on a flight in eight hours. Sighing, I gulp at my coffee.</p><p>\u201cSo much for a vacation,\u201d I sigh again in resignation.</p><p>I can practically hear my manager smile through the phone. \u201cYour brothers have a show in Amsterdam. I\u2019m going to arrange for you to swing through there on your way home. You might not catch the show, but you can visit your brothers for a day or two. I know you haven\u2019t seen them in a while.\u201d</p><p>True story. Because of their world tour, I haven\u2019t seen them in months. I had actually been looking forward to their show in Chicago next month just so I can have the chance to see them. We\u2019ve always been close, but our hectic schedules prevent us from getting together as much as we\u2019d like.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I answer. \u201cI\u2019ll be on the plane at seven. Are you coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I can\u2019t trust you to stay out of trouble over there.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s kidding or not.</p><p>\u201cOh, by the way,\u201d he adds. \u201cI sent you a gift. It should be there any minute. I figured your house needs cleaned before you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a housekeeper,\u201d I remind him.</p><p>\u201cNot like this, you don\u2019t,\u201d he answer cryptically, and then hangs up.</p><p>I barely have time to finish my cup of coffee before my doorbell rings.</p><p>I pad over the marble floors to answer it, only bothering to pull on a pair of pants before I do.</p><p>I\u2019m still shirtless when I open the door and find two gorgeous college-aged girls standing in front of me. Blonde, pert, big tits.</p><p>Just the way I like them.</p><p>I grin, a slow grin that the public knows and loves.</p><p>Both girls grin back.</p><p>\u201cAnd you are?\u201d I lift my eyebrow. They both giggle.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re from Naked Maids,\u201d one of them tells me. \u201cWe\u2019re here to clean your house....naked.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but grin again at the mere thought. Tally. Leave it to him to find something like this. He always looks out for me...on every level.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I tell them, ushering them in. \u201cThe only problem is... my house is already clean. Can we find something else for you to do?\u201d</p><p>They look at each other slyly as I lead them through the house to my living room.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to do anything else,\u201d the taller one says. \u201cBut you\u2019re Dominic Kinkaide. We\u2019ll break the rules for you.\u201d</p><p>My grin widens.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfect,\u201c I tell them. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a rule breaker. I have a great idea. Brilliant, really. I\u2019d like for you to clean her,\u201d and I point at the other girl. \u201cWith your tongue.\u201d</p><p>They aren\u2019t even fazed. She nods with a mischievous look in her eye and they move to the center of the room and drop onto the plush rug.</p><p>I situate myself on a sofa, my legs sprawled out as I watch.</p><p>God, I love to watch.</p><p>Hands, lips, tongues and fingers move together, rubbing, stroking, sucking. My dick hardens and I pull it out, stroking it with my fingers.</p><p>The girls look up.</p><p>\u201cWant some help?\u201d the shorter one asks, her lips glistening.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo. I want to watch you. Keep going.\u201d</p><p>They turn back to each other, burying their tongues in each other\u2019s mouth as their hands move everywhere. Their fingers slip in, out, wet. They moan softly as they suckle each other, constantly glancing over their shoulders to see if I like the show.</p><p>I do.</p><p>I finish up within a few minutes and lay sated on my couch as they finish each other off.</p><p>They look up at me as I get to my feet.</p><p>\u201cAnything else you want us to do?\u201d one of them purrs.</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cMaybe clean up the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>Their faces are astonished as I walk away and don\u2019t look back, headed for my shower. I guess they don\u2019t get that request very often.</p><p>As I let the water wash over my face and stream down my body, I think about my life. It\u2019s filled with women, in and out of my days and nights like clouds passing in the sky. None of them mean anything to me. None of them will ever mean anything to me. Nothing does.</p><p>I take a very long shower, breathing in the steam, before I finally step out and get dressed. When I make my way back downstairs, the nude maids are gone. The kitchen has been cleared of my coffee cup, the coffee maker wiped clean. So they actually knew how to clean, after all. I\u2019m mildly surprised.</p><p>I grab a book and head out to the pool, soaking in the sun while I read. I should enjoy it while I can. London is notoriously gray and rainy.</p><p>The afternoon passes quickly and before I know it, I only have an hour before I need to depart for the airport. I put the book away and pack a bag.</p><p>I\u2019m just opening the door to my Porsche when a large black car glides to a stop in front of me.</p><p>A curvy blonde bombshell in a chauffeur\u2019s hat steps out of the driver\u2019s seat, dressed in short boy shorts, high heels and thick stripper\u2019s makeup.</p><p>\u201cYour car, sir,\u201d she tells me, her eyes sweeping me up and down.</p><p>I\u2019m surprised for a minute, but then I grin.</p><p>Tally.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you drive topless?\u201d I ask wryly as I put my bag in the open trunk. She smiles flirtatiously.</p><p>\u201cNo. But Abbi, your flight attendant, can. If you want.\u201d</p><p>I glance over her shoulder to find another girl, a slender brunette in a skimpy flight attendant uniform, already seated in the back of the limo, pouring a glass of champagne. She holds out the drink to me with a smile.</p><p>\u201cAbbi?\u201d I ask, my fingers brushing hers as I take the glass. She nods, then allows her fingers to rest at the top of my thigh when I settle into the seat next to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take good care of you during your flight,\u201d she assures me softly.</p><p>It\u2019s good to be Dominic Kinkaide.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Jet lag is a bitch. A serious, wenchy bitch with a hard-on for revenge.</p><p>I roll over in bed and glare at the alarm. I didn\u2019t sleep much on the plane. In part due to the fact that I never sleep well on them. In another part because of Abbi. The girl aimed to please. Over and over again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tally pretended not to see as Abbi knelt in front of me, not once, not twice but three times during the eleven hour flight. It was nice at the time, of course, but after arriving into Heathrow at 6am without a wink of sleep, I decided to check into my hotel and get a couple hours of shut eye.</p><p>Of course now, three hours later, it\u2019s time to get up and I feel worse than ever. I probably shouldn\u2019t have slept at all.</p><p>I grab my phone and punch in Tally\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cDude, I can\u2019t get up,\u201d I groan. \u201cPostpone the promo shoot, would you? I need to sleep.\u201d</p> <p>Tally sighs. \u201cStop acting like your brother. Sin always does this shit to me. Get your ass out of bed, take a cold shower to wake up and get here. You\u2019re already five minutes late.\u201d</p><p>He hangs up and I throw my phone. It hits the wall and slides to the floor, apparently unbroken. I should have thrown it harder. Fuck this shit.</p><p>As I head into the shower, I grab the room\u2019s phone and dial the front desk.</p><p>\u201cSend up a Blood Mary,\u201d I tell them without preamble. \u201cIn fact, send two.\u201d I don\u2019t wait for a response before I hang up.</p><p>When I step back out of the shower ten minutes later, two icy cold Bloody Marys are waiting for me on the table in my sitting room. I already feel better from the cold water. But the Bloody Marys make me one step closer to human.</p> <p>Not close enough to deal with Amy\u2019s drama this early, however. Her name flashes on the face of my phone and I wonder if she has already arrived. I vaguely remember Tally saying she\u2019d be a day late.</p><p>I let it go to voicemail.</p><p>She calls right back.</p><p>I let it go to voicemail again.</p><p>She\u2019s got to learn that I won\u2019t drop what I\u2019m doing for her. I\u2019ll never do that. I don\u2019t care who she is.</p><p>When I\u2019m in the car riding to the set, I listen to her voicemail. In the first one, she\u2019s snotty.</p> <p>\u201cDom, where the hell are you? I know you\u2019re on set, so I know you have your phone. Answer it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m rolling my eyes as I listen to her second message.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, babe. I was being bitchy. I\u2019m bitchy when I\u2019m tired.\u201d And hungry, anxious, bored, calm, or otherwise, I think. \u201cAnyway, I just wanted you to know that I can\u2019t wait to see you. I\u2019m getting in later tonight. Let\u2019s have a late dinner, OK? Talk to you soon. Kisses.\u201d</p><p>I sigh as I slip my phone back into my jacket pocket.</p><p>She\u2019s starting to get clingy. They always do. And I had really thought that with Amy\u2019s prickly personality, she wouldn\u2019t. But here we go. The same old song and dance. I know how it ends and it won\u2019t be pretty. But it won\u2019t end yet. I\u2019ll get what I can out of it while it lasts.</p><p>I close my eyes for a few minutes, until the car glides to a stop. I glance at the window and sigh. Fans are already lined up. How they know where I\u2019ll be, I don\u2019t know. This is just a promo shoot, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>But I paste a smile on as I step outside of the car, as the fans scream and faint and try to touch me.</p><p>Sign myshirtDominicSignmyboobsDominicCanIkissyouPleaseDominicTakeapicturewithmeDominic!</p> <p>Dominic! Dominic! I love you, Dominic!</p><p>Their voices blend together as security pushes them back and ushers me through the masses, through the sweat and perfume, and into the building. I take a deep breath as we step into the silence and I don\u2019t glance back. I know what I\u2019ll see.</p><p>People scrambling to get another glimpse of me, hoping that I\u2019ll come back outside. They don\u2019t even know me, but they think they do because they\u2019ve seen me on-screen so often.</p><p>My fans are why I am so successful. I know that. And I appreciate them. I do. But I\u2019m an intensely private person and having people tear at my clothing unnerves me in a way I\u2019d never thought possible.</p><p>But in order to avoid looking ungrateful, I grin and pretend it doesn\u2019t bother me. I flash the sexy smile that the world recognizes as mine.</p><p>They don\u2019t have to know that it\u2019s a mask, that it\u2019s all an act.</p><p>I\u2019m an actor. They should expect it.</p><p>\u201cI want to see the Tower of London this time,\u201d Amy demands as she takes a bite of cracker slathered in caviar.</p><p>I stare at her. \u201cAren\u2019t you worried they\u2019ll keep you in it? They\u2019ve confined witches in it before.\u201d</p><p>Amy stops chewing for a moment, her blue eyes astonished. Then she laughs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a dick, Dominic,\u201d she chuckles, leaning over the sofa arm to slide her fingers along my cheek. \u201cBut that\u2019s why I adore you. You say what you want to say to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just call a spade a spade,\u201d I shrug. \u201cYou know you\u2019re a bitch and you don\u2019t care. It\u2019s one of the things I like about you.\u201d</p><p>She eyes me, her expression hardening a bit. \u201cYou like about me? I just said I adore you. And you like me? What the hell, Dom? I\u2019m not feeling the love from you lately.\u201d</p><p>And here we go. I knew this was coming.</p><p>I set my whiskey tumbler down and level a stare at her.</p><p>\u201cAmy, you knew going into this what I\u2019m like.... What I\u2019m after. I\u2019m not after a relationship. At all. I like you. I respect you. I enjoy having you in my bed. But love? That\u2019s not who I am, Amy.\u201d</p><p>She leans back, her eyes narrowing now, but filled with amusement.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you think now,\u201d she tells me knowingly. \u201cJust wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d I raise an eyebrow. \u201cUntil hell freezes over? Because that\u2019s how long you\u2019ll wait if you\u2019re wanting more from me than what we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cWhatever.\u201d She waves one hand, the diamond rings adorning her fingers sparkling in the dimmed light of my sitting room. \u201cI\u2019m going to be jetlagged. So I should take a sleeping pill and go to bed. But first, let\u2019s go to bed.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me, her gaze turning dark and sultry, as she stands up and slowly begins shrugging out of her clothing.</p><p>I lean back in my seat and enjoy the show.</p><p>Half of Amy\u2019s body isn\u2019t real... it\u2019s been enhanced by plastic surgeons. But because of that, it\u2019s perfect. Her tits are large and round, her nipples pointed to the sky. Her stomach is perfectly flat, her hips swelled to perfection. Due to liposuction, there isn\u2019t one trace of fat on her.</p><p>She\u2019s unnaturally perfect. I personally prefer real curves, imperfections and all.</p><p>But I don\u2019t say that. Instead, I just enjoy the show.</p><p>Bending over in front of me, she slides her panties off and tosses them into my lap. I pick up the lace with one finger and hold it to my nose, inhaling it.</p><p>\u201cYou smell good,\u201d I observe.</p><p>She smiles.</p><p>\u201cYou know I do,\u201d she purrs, gliding to my side and dropping onto my lap. Reaching into her nearby purse, she pulls out a pair of padded handcuffs.</p><p>\u201cGet on your bed, Dom,\u201d she commands. \u201cI want to be in charge tonight.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m in the mood for that. Lying back and zoning out... letting the intense feelings of pain and pleasure blend together until I can\u2019t tell one from the other?</p><p>Yes, please.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I smirk, as I get to my feet and head for the bedroom. \u201cBut stay the hell away from my nipples. If you pull that nipple clamp out of your bag, so help me, I\u2019m out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your room,\u201d she points out dryly.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. Then you\u2019ll be out of here. And I won\u2019t give you time to put your clothes on, either.\u201d</p><p>She giggles now, unconcerned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d like that, you freak. Watching me strut down the hallway naked, with everyone watching me? I know you\u2019d love that.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s true. I would. And I\u2019d also like to watch.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blindfold me,\u201d I instruct her as she folds her body against mine and begins to unbutton my shirt with experienced fingers. \u201cI want to watch your tits as I lick you.\u201d</p><p>She sighs into my mouth, her tongue plundering my own. She tastes of vodka and caviar.</p><p>\u201cLick me from back to front and everywhere in between,\u201d she tells me. \u201cAnd then,\u201d she pauses as she reaches one more time into her bag. She pulls out a pierced dildo, ten inches long and pierced through several times, Prince Albert style. \u201cAnd then fuck me with this. After I unlock your handcuffs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it done,\u201d I murmur huskily as she snaps the manacles around my wrists. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a fucking freak, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you like about me,\u201d she whispers as she crawls over me and arches her hips against my lips.</p><p>That\u2019s true. It is.</p><p>Amy grinds into my face and I absorb her taste, her smell. She bends backward and rakes her fingernails into my thighs, hard. I\u2019m sure she drew blood, but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m already at the point where the lines between pain and pleasure have blurred.</p><p>I know that tonight will be spent in just such a place, a place filled with varying shades of gray, where no guilt or worry lingers. Memories from my past will be gone, guilt from my past nonexistent.</p><p>Just for tonight. It can all resume again in the morning, but for tonight, I\u2019m going to enjoy every kinky hour of oblivion.</p><p>There will be no blacks, no whites, and no rights, no wrongs.</p><p>I\u2019ll do what feels good, without regard to what society might think. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Because I\u2019m Dominic Fucking Kinkaide....and that\u2019s what I do.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you fuck me?\u201d Amy asks me, out of the blue.</p><p>I look up in surprise.</p> <p>After Amy slipped out of my hotel room in the middle of the night, we met here on set for breakfast, and have been curled up in my trailer for the past hour. As we wait to be called into makeup, Amy\u2019s got her head buried in a magazine, but she\u2019s staring over the top of it now, her blue eyes accusatory.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I ask stiltedly, although I heard exactly what she said.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you fuck me?\u201d Amy demands again. \u201cEveryone on the planet wants to fuck me, and I offer myself to you on a platter and you won\u2019t do it. Not really. You have no problems fucking me up the ass or letting me suck you off....but you won\u2019t actually fuck me. I want to know why. I know you don\u2019t have a problem getting it up. So what is the problem?\u201d</p><p>Icy pangs shoot through my heart and I try to ignore them, to push them back down to where they belong. I knew this was coming.</p><p>I knew this was coming, I remind myself. A confrontation about what is wrong with me. I knew it.</p> <p>But knowing it never makes it any easier.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem,\u201d I answer icily, staring her down, her blue eyes locking with my own green ones. \u201cJust because I won\u2019t fuck you, you think I have a problem?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs with her slender shoulders. \u201cYou must. Everyone wants to fuck me.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s tense now, poised stiffly on the edge of her seat, prepared for rejection as she waits for me to answer. I know her. I know what she thinks, how she feels. And like most artists, she\u2019s secretly insecure. She\u2019s afraid that there\u2019s something wrong with her and that\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to fuck her.</p><p>I don\u2019t allay that fear. I\u2019m not a good enough person for that. She doesn\u2019t hesitate to cut people down to size simply because she feels like being a bitch. I feel no guilt over not soothing her ego right now.</p><p>\u201cMaybe everyone does,\u201d I tell her as nonchalantly as I can. \u201cBut I don\u2019t. Not right now.\u201d</p> <p>She sits up straighter, her shoulders back and her chin stuck out. \u201cOh, really? And why exactly is that?\u201d</p><p>I stare at her coolly. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t feel like it. Too much drama. You\u2019d only fall in love with me.\u201d</p><p>I play it off like that, like I\u2019m arrogant and cold and like I really believe my own words. Everything\u2019s an act, you see. And this is part of my character. I\u2019m an arrogant asshole.</p><p>Except, of course, I really am. At this point in my life, the act has become my reality.</p><p>But regardless of my words, I\u2019m not afraid she\u2019d fall in love with me. That\u2019s not the reason that I haven\u2019t fucked her... or that I haven\u2019t actually fucked someone in six years. Six. Fucking Years.</p><p>Six years since it happened.</p><p>The mere thought of it, of her, constricts my heart tightly in my chest, like a fucking vise grip has its claws wrapped around it.</p><p>Emma.</p> <p>A vision of her wide blue eyes sparkling at me ripples through my memory and I squeeze my eyes shut to close her out. Reaching into my pocket, I grip the necklace, her necklace, allowing my fingers to trace over the cool aquamarine. It\u2019s the only thing that helps, the only thing that calms me down. It reminds me.</p><p>And makes me forget.</p><p>\u201cDominic?\u201d Amy snaps, bringing me back to the present, and away from Emma\u2019s glistening eyes.</p><p>I open my own.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d she asks curiously, her eyes softening just a bit as she stares at me. I realize that I\u2019m clammy and cold. Anxious. On edge.</p><p>This is what Emma does to me even now.</p><p>I put her out of my mind and turn my attention to the needy woman in front of me.</p><p>I force a grin. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. At all.\u201d</p><p>Amy stares at me. \u201cThen prove it. When we\u2019re done here, let\u2019s go on a date. Take me to the Tower of London, then take me back to your hotel room and make me scream your name tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou scream my name on a regular basis,\u201d I point out wryly. She rolls her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean. I want your penis inside my body while I\u2019m screaming it this time. For real.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, then run one finger over the swell of her fully clothed hip.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. Not tonight. I can take you to the Tower, but then I\u2019m flying out to Amsterdam to see my brothers. I\u2019ll have to take a raincheck.\u201d</p><p>Amy\u2019s interested now. \u201cSin and Duncan? I want to go. You know I love seeing the Devil\u2019s Own. Maybe you can make me scream your name in Amsterdam, instead. In fact, let\u2019s make a bet. I bet you that I can make you want to fuck me before we leave Amsterdam.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s never going to happen.</p><p>But I don\u2019t say that. Instead, I smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you win?\u201d</p><p>She smiles back. \u201cThen you get to fuck me. That\u2019s your prize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I win?\u201d</p><p>Amy scowls now, displeased by the mere thought that I might not want her. \u201cIf you win, your prize will be not having to hear me bitch about this anymore, because we\u2019ll be done. You\u2019ll go your way and I\u2019ll go mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d I reply calmly. \u201cSo basically, if I don\u2019t fuck you by the time we leave Amsterdam tomorrow night, we\u2019re done?\u201d</p><p>She nods, pleased by what she thinks is her ultimatum. What she doesn\u2019t understand is that I don\u2019t give a flying fuck if I ever see her again...at least, in a personal capacity. She thinks she\u2019s got all the power and control in this equation, but she\u2019s wrong.</p><p>I\u2019m going to see exactly what she\u2019s willing to do to get me to fuck her... and then I\u2019ll leave her without looking back.</p><p>I smile. \u201cOkay. Challenge accepted.\u201d</p><p>She smiles back and cups my crotch with her thin fingers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d I answer. Because I know I will, but ultimately, Amy won\u2019t. You don\u2019t try to push me around\u2014or manipulate me.</p><p>It will never end well for you.</p><p>\u201cDude,\u201d my brother Sin shouts into the phone. \u201cWhat the hell? You don\u2019t call for weeks, then you call right before I step onstage?\u201d</p><p>So that explains the loud screaming and noise in the background. Everyone is waiting for my rockstar brother to appear.</p><p>\u201cSorry, bro,\u201d I answer, unconcerned. \u201cJust calling to tell you that I\u2019ll be there later tonight. I can\u2019t make your show, but Tally figured out a way to fit a visit into my schedule at least.\u201d</p><p>That perks up Sin\u2019s attention and he hollers to our other brother Duncan. \u201cHey, little D. Dom\u2019s coming to the party tonight. Order more hookers.\u201d</p><p>He cackles into the phone and I have to laugh....at several things. One, because he called Duncan little. Like Sin and me, Duncan is tall. Really tall. 6\u20194 or so. Broad-shouldered, slim-hipped. Not little in the slightest. And two, that he\u2019s ordering hookers in Amsterdam. The irony of it, because he\u2019s surrounded by groupies all of the time who would do anything he asks... for free.</p><p>\u201cHookers?\u201d I ask dubiously. Sin snorts into the phone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Amsterdam,\u201d he says, by way of explanation. \u201cWe can\u2019t come into Amsterdam and not visit the red light district. That would be sacrilege.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s my turn to snort.</p><p>\u201cThe red light district?\u201d I chuckle. \u201cAnd how exactly are you and baby brother Duncan going to slip into the red light district unseen by paparazzi?\u201d</p><p>I can practically feel Sin shrug through the phone. Because he doesn\u2019t give a flying fuck.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if they see me or not,\u201d he answers flippantly. \u201cI don\u2019t live my life according to what they think is acceptable or not. And speaking of that, I\u2019ve got to go. Are you going to be here for my party or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He hangs up without another word and I glance over at my manager. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long night.\u201d</p><p>Tally grins without even looking up from his smartphone. \u201cYep. You might want to drink a few cans of Red Bull, old man.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cDo you have any?\u201d</p><p>Tally glances up. \u201cI had them stock the plane with it, enough for Amy too. She\u2019ll need it if she\u2019s going to keep up with you.\u201d He pauses, then stares at me. \u201cBe careful how you treat her. The public loves to see you starring together. You\u2019ve got to think of your image, first and foremost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very close to being done with her,\u201d I tell him calmly. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stay with her just to satisfy public perception.\u201d</p><p>Tally continues his stare-down. \u201cAnd I would never suggest that. I\u2019m just telling you to let her down with respect. Don\u2019t treat her like a whore. Break up like a normal person.\u201d</p><p>I pause, considering that. \u201cBut what if she acts like a whore?\u201d</p><p>Tally shakes his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Be a gentleman. The public loves that about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Amy already headed out to the plane?\u201d I ask, grabbing a gulp of Tally\u2019s drink.</p><p>\u201cThe last I heard, yes,\u201d Tally answers, getting to his feet and straightening his jacket. \u201cAlthough, she got into an altercation in the lobby with some fans. Some little girl wanted her autograph and Amy went off on her for invading her personal space. For fuck\u2019s sake, Amy needs some lessons in PR. She\u2019s a nightmare. You ready?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nod and we walk from the hotel to a waiting car.</p><p>The drive to the airport doesn\u2019t take long and within a few more moments, I\u2019m walking up the stairs and entering the plane. I\u2019m immediately struck with the vision of Amy sitting with two young blondes on a leather sofa.</p><p>The two blondes are topless and Amy is in the middle, dressed only in a red leather corset.</p><p>My dick tightens in pants.</p> <p>Tally slams into me from behind, since I\u2019ve stopped dead-still in the aisle and he swivels around me to see what the hold-up is. I hear him suck in his breath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking lucky son-of-a-bitch, Kinkaide,\u201d he mutters. \u201cI\u2019ll just...stay up here.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer. Instead, I take a step, then another.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I ask nonchalantly, staring down at Amy\u2019s upturned face. She reaches out and trails her fingers down my thigh.</p><p>\u201cOh, this?\u201d she asks innocently, glancing at her two friends. \u201cThese are my assistants and I\u2019m going to loan them to you for the evening, as well. Anything you need, just ask. They\u2019ll be happy to oblige. And me? I\u2019m in a rare accommodating mood, too. Whatever you desire, no matter what it is... ask. And it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p> <p>And now I\u2019m amused. Amy Ashby is stooping to this? For what? Just to fuck me? I have a growing suspicion that it\u2019s less the driving need to fuck me and more about saving her wounded ego because I don\u2019t seem to want to. Her ego is the biggest thing about her.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I smile. \u201cThis could be an interesting evening.\u201d</p><p>Amy smiles back and pats the seat next to her. The blonde to her left moves over, giving me space to sit. When I do, they each loop a leg over one of mine, effectively holding me down.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a drink?\u201d the other blonde whispers to me, her full lips mere centimeters from my ear.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answer. \u201cWhiskey. Neat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d she answers. She slips away and while she\u2019s gone, her blonde friend massages my thigh, then slips her fingers around to my lower back, soothing my tired muscles.</p> <p>Within minutes, the other girl comes back with a glass of whiskey on a tray, and a black velvet blindfold.</p><p>\u201cAmy wants you to wear this,\u201d she says softly. \u201cLet me help you with it.\u201d Bending forward, her soft tits envelop my face as she slides the blindfold over my head. I inhale her feminine scent, soft and flowery.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d I ask as I lean back, totally blind.</p><p>\u201cNow, enjoy your flight,\u201d the girl says brightly.</p><p>And I fully intend to.</p><p>But as they softly stroke my back, my thighs, my face, my chest... their soothing touches have the opposite effect on me than they intend. Because I\u2019ve been up and on-set for ten hours today, I\u2019m exhausted.</p><p>Instead of turning me on, their soothing touches put me to sleep.</p><p>When I wake, we\u2019ve landed in Amsterdam and Amy is glaring at me from across the plane.</p> <p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d she demands. \u201cI went out of my way to plan the perfect evening for you. I have everything you could possibly want on board this plane... and you went to sleep? What the hell, Dominic?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but grin at this, just a little. She\u2019s pissed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I tell her as soothingly as I can. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted and jet-lagged. It\u2019s not a reflection on you. Or of your sexy assistants.\u201d I glance at them and find that they\u2019re fully clothed now. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I tell them. \u201cI didn\u2019t meant offend you.\u201d</p><p>They both smile warmly. \u201cNot a problem,\u201d one says. \u201cWe\u2019ll can pick up where we left off later.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Amy and raise an eyebrow. \u201cLater?\u201d</p><p>She nods in satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cI told you... you\u2019ll fuck me by the time this night is over. We\u2019re all going to Sin\u2019s party. And we all know... if something freaky doesn\u2019t happen at one of his parties, then it\u2019s not meant to happen.\u201d</p><p>I have to give her that. My brother\u2019s parties are beyond the normal....so far beyond the norm that they\u2019re off the map.</p><p>I nod, not committing, but not declining, either.</p><p>As we deplane, I have a brief memory, a fleeting vision of one other time, years ago, when I\u2019d been at a party and had gotten the worst phone call of my life. The night that had changed my life forever. The night that had crushed my heart into ash.</p><p>I reach into my pocket, twisting the pendant round and round in my fingers.</p><p>I can\u2019t feel anything, not anymore. So what I have to do is go through the motions. And if that means trying to do crazy, kinky, sexual things just to be able to feel something, I\u2019ll do it.</p><p>Because honestly, I haven\u2019t decided what\u2019s worse: not being able to feel something, or being so stuck in the pain of the past that I\u2019m paralyzed with it. For six years, I\u2019ve held out the hope that I\u2019ll come around. That the pain will stop. That I\u2019ll miraculously become normal.</p><p>But slowly, I\u2019m coming to terms with the fact that it isn\u2019t going to happen.</p><p>I\u2019m not normal.</p><p>There\u2019s no use pretending to be.</p><p>And if I\u2019m going to hell for all the shit that I do, I might as well make the crime fits the punishment.</p><p>Until I burn in hell, I might as well make every single moment worth it.</p><p>Starting tonight.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Sin\u2019s penthouse suite is the entire top floor of a glitzy hotel in the center of the city. Sin never does anything understated. He prefers to be the center of attention at any given time and he always pulls it off with panache.</p><p>Amy, me and her two \u2018assistants\u2019 push through the throngs of people lounging, dancing and chattering throughout these rooms. Scantily clad people, half naked people. Drunk people. High people. All kinds of people.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your brother?\u201d Amy calls over her shoulder to me. I look around. I don\u2019t see him anywhere.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s check his bedroom. He never lets anyone in there...except for certain women.\u201d</p><p>And by certain, I mean whichever women he chose from the crowd at his show. His bouncers would\u2019ve plucked the girls from the throngs, given them backstage passes and then accompanied them to Sin\u2019s after party. It\u2019s just what he does. And he never gets tired of it.</p><p>When we tap on his door and he answers in only his jeans, I can see two naked women in his bed over his shoulder. And I know I\u2019m right.</p><p>\u201cDude,\u201d he mutters. \u201cCould you have worse timing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I interrupt something?\u201d I grin innocently. Sin scowls at me.</p><p>\u201cJesus. First you miss my show, then you cock block me. Nice, bro.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle as Sin throws his door open wide, motioning us inside. \u201cYou might as well come inside,\u201d he mutters. Then he glances behind me at Amy and her two friends, and his manner changes. He instantly becomes Sin Kinkaide, charming chick magnet.</p><p>\u201cHello, ladies,\u201d he drawls. Amy smiles at him, unfazed by his celebrity status and blatant sexual energy. Her friends, however, are not. They blush and become instantly on edge. Sin grins.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a private party goin\u2019 on in here,\u201d he tells them, still grinning. Still shirtless. \u201cIt\u2019s very exclusive. Only the most beautiful women in the city get to attend. Would you like to come in?\u201d</p><p>They\u2019re in awe now, flattered by the invitation, and without a backward glance, they step into his room. As he closes the door, I see the two girls in the bed scoot over to make room for the two new girls.</p><p>I turn to Amy, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cWell, you lost your accomplices.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes and grabs a glass of champagne from the tray of a passing waiter. Running her tongue along the rim, she stares at me over it.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need them. All you need is me, Dom. By tonight, you\u2019ll realize that.\u201d</p><p>Before I can answer or refute that statement, she gazes past me, intent on something across the room.</p><p>\u201cHmmm. There\u2019s Tara Linwood. I\u2019ll be back in a minute. Think about me while I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>As she brushes past me to chat with the up-and-coming actress across the room, she pushes something into my hand. Glancing down, I see that it\u2019s her panties, a tiny piece of silk and lace meant to turn to me on.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t. I prefer my women pantiless... or in red silk. I lay the panties on a nearby table, next to a bowl of mints. They should brighten someone else\u2019s day. Oddly enough, knowing that Amy is pantiless now across the room doesn\u2019t turn me on, either. Which means that it\u2019s probably time to end things.</p><p>It\u2019s just as well that she chose to give me this ultimatum.</p><p>I get bored very easily and apparently, even bitchy A-list actresses don\u2019t hold my attention long.</p><p>As I walk toward the open balcony, a young waitress catches my eye from across the room, her eyes lighting up as she recognizes me. She quickly tries to hide her excitement, to act professional and nonchalant as she offers me a drink from her tray, but it\u2019s too late. I already saw it.</p><p>And I\u2019m filing it away for later.</p><p>I\u2019ll probably be here for several hours. I might get bored later.</p><p>For now, I settle onto a cushioned seat in the corner of the darkened veranda, staring down at the bright lights of the city.</p><p>From this position, I can see everything I want to see. I can observe party guests and their drunken behavior, I can look down upon the city, and I can stay to myself and not interact with anyone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s a win-win situation.</p><p>This is how I stay, winning in my little dark corner, drinking glasses of whiskey, until Tally arrives. He knows just where to hunt for me, his gaze scanning the perimeter of the party as he steps inside the suite.</p><p>He knows he\u2019ll always find me in the shadows.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Amy?\u201d he asks, dropping into the seat across from me and motioning for a waiter to bring him a drink.</p> <p>\u201cSomewhere with Tara Linwood,\u201d I answer. I glance around, but don\u2019t see her.</p><p>Tally shakes his head. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be happy about this. But. The studio doesn\u2019t want you to end things with her. It\u2019s good for the film if people think you\u2019re dating. They want to see an onscreen couple who is actually dating in real life. If you\u2019re still thinking of breaking up with her, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, my hard gaze icy.</p><p>\u201cI do what I want. I don\u2019t let the studio dictate to me who I date and who I don\u2019t. I\u2019ve never been that way and I never will be.\u201d</p><p>Tally sighs. \u201cI knew you were going to say that. You and your brothers are the stubbornest sons-of-bitches I know.\u201d</p> <p>The corner of my mouth tilts up, just a bit.</p><p>\u201cWell good. I\u2019m glad you know where I stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll still have to pretend that you\u2019re together,\u201d Tally tells me firmly, pressing another drink into my hand. \u201cAnd if you can\u2019t stomach that, then you\u2019ll have to figure out a way to make her end things with you. Let her be the one to bring the studio\u2019s wrath down on her head. Not you.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but chuckle a little. \u201cI\u2019m sure I could find a few ways to piss her off.\u201d</p><p>Tally levels a gaze at me. \u201cBut not anything obvious. You can\u2018t be seen as a dickhead, either. Always, always always.... Keep your public persona forefront in your mind. You are mysterious. You are sexy. You are a gentleman. You are private. All of these things are fine. Maintain that image. Do not appear to be a dickhead. Got it?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI can do that. Besides, she already gave me an ultimatum. Sleep with her tonight, or we\u2019re done.\u201d</p> <p>Tally raises an incredulous eyebrow. \u201cYou haven\u2019t slept with her yet? What the fuck? Are you made of stone?\u201d</p><p>Before I answer, we both look up to see Amy and Tara stumbling from the bathroom together. Amy\u2019s nose is red, a sure sign that they were snorting coke. I personally know it\u2019s one of the ways she stays so slim. They\u2019re both stumbling, a sure sign that they\u2019re drunk, as well.</p><p>An idea forms, hard and fast.</p><p>A brilliant idea.</p><p>No one puts Dominic Kinkaide in a corner. No one gives me ultimatums and expects to win.</p><p>I am not controlled.</p><p>Not now, not ever.</p><p>But first things first.</p> <p>I watch Amy and Tara collapse into one big chair together, giggling and chattering as they furtively glance around the room. I know they\u2019re probably cutting down everyone here. Both women are complete catty bitches.</p><p>They bore me.</p><p>So I motion to the young waitress, the girl who was starstruck earlier.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I say to her smoothly, putting my hand on her arm as she passes. She stares down at me, her green eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she stutters.</p><p>\u201cWhere is the bathroom?\u201d I ask politely, although I know perfectly well where it is.</p><p>She points in the direction. \u201cRight there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you possibly show me the way?\u201d I ask, my voice as smooth as honey. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get lost.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widen as she realizes what my intentions probably are and then she smiles broadly. \u201cOf course. I\u2019d be happy to show you.\u201d</p><p>She puts her tray down on the table in front of me, because she knows she won\u2019t be needing it.</p><p>And then I lead her to the bathroom. Amy watches me in amusement from her chair, but she doesn\u2019t get up or react. She knows me. She likes watching me with other women anyway.</p><p>In fact, a few minutes later as the waitress is kneeling in front of me, the doorknob jiggles and I hear Amy\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cDom? I want to come in.\u201d</p><p>Of course she does.</p><p>She wants to watch, because she\u2019s as kinky as I am.</p><p>But instead of unlocking the door, I grasp the willing waitress\u2019 hair, and guide her into deep-throating me, her lips forming a perfect wet vacuum around me.</p><p>\u201cNot now, Amy. I\u2019m a little preoccupied,\u201d I call toward the closed door.</p><p>I can hear her bitching as she walks away.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t matter. At the moment, all that matters is this blow job.</p><p>I\u2019ll deal with Amy later.</p><p>But I will deal with her.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cYou took long enough,\u201d Amy whines when I finally come out of the bathroom and find her. She\u2019s sitting with Tara on the veranda, in the darkened corner that I had recently vacated.</p><p>Tara looks up at me, her eyes glazed over in a drug-induced haze. I sigh, seeing only the talent that she\u2019s getting ready to waste. I\u2019ve seen it a hundred times. Actresses come into the industry, show so much promise and then self-implode on their way to the top. I can see right now Tara Linwood won\u2019t last.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t rush,\u201d I shrug my shoulders. \u201cBut I\u2019m ready to go now.\u201d</p><p>Amy lifts an eyebrow. \u201cOh, really? And where are you ready to go?\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cSomeplace where the lights are red.\u201d</p><p>Amy\u2019s eyes widen as she realizes what I\u2019m talking about. The infamous Red Light district in Amsterdam, where prostitution is legal and kink of any nature can be bought.</p><p>She grins. \u201cYou surprise me, Dom. I wouldn\u2019t think that you\u2019d risk getting seen someplace like that. You know the paparazzi are everywhere.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cWe\u2019ll be careful. Are you in?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cOf course. I\u2019ll bring Tara.\u201d</p><p>I glance at her friend, who is now leaning on Amy\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cCan she walk?\u201d I ask dubiously. Amy scowls at Tara, before pushing her off her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find out.\u201d</p><p>She yanks Tara to her feet and together, they stumble toward the door. I watch for just a second before shaking my head.</p><p>This is going to be too easy.</p><p>For one split moment, I almost feel guilty, but then I tamp that emotion down. Amy deserves no pity. I\u2019ve seen her verbally lash stagehands into tears for such small offenses as not making sure her water was cold enough. Her heart is black and she deserves anything I give her....particularly since she thought she could control me.</p><p>Not gonna happen.</p><p>I follow them to a car and within minutes, we have arrived in the Red Light district of Amsterdam.</p><p>The streets are wet and dark as we walk down them, glancing into the windows that line the street. Women sit in rooms, waiting for customers, as the red lights flicker over their heads.</p><p>I meet the gaze of one woman, a pretty dark haired woman. Her eyes light up as she sees me and she grins, revealing yellowed teeth. I cringe.</p><p>Not gonna happen.</p><p>\u201cGross,\u201d Amy scowls. \u201cIt looks like the city\u2019s leftovers are here. Let\u2019s go someplace else.\u201d</p><p>She starts to turn around, but I catch a glimpse of another window down the street, one that houses two women. I put my hand on Amy\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>We walk a bit closer, then closer still, all the while, Amy is practically holding up Tara.</p><p>The two girls look like sisters, identical shoulder-length blonde hair, large green eyes, slip hips. They\u2019re dressed in identical lingerie and are sitting in the same identical pose, perched atop two tall stools.</p><p>\u201cTwins,\u201d Amy breathes, turning to stare at me, her eyes widened. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I have to grin at the possibilities.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d Tara mumbles, her head rolling around on her neck like a broken bobble-head doll. I raise an eyebrow at Amy.</p><p>She scowls and slaps Tara\u2019s face lightly, then harder. \u201cWake the fuck up, Tara,\u201d she snaps. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to grow up and learn how to handle your liquor better.\u201d</p><p>I gaze at her. \u201cI doubt that the liquor is her problem.\u201d</p><p>Amy ignores my meaning and shakes Tara\u2019s arm as we ring the bell next to the window. One of the girls comes forward and speaks through the speaker.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe want to hire you,\u201d Amy says firmly. \u201cLet us in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPayment first,\u201d the girl answers, just as firmly, holding Amy\u2019s gaze. Amy frowns, but we do as requested, pushing our payment through a little window. After the transaction is complete, we\u2019re buzzed in. I glance around the dingy hallway as we make our way to the door.</p><p>It opens immediately.</p><p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d the blond girl purrs now, motioning for us to come inside. Her sister is on the bed and the shades have been drawn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Anika,\u201d the standing girl says. \u201cAnd that is Anna. We\u2019re here to please you. What would you like?\u201d</p><p>Amy shoves Tara onto the bed and then pulls at me, but I stand fast.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to watch,\u201d I tell Anika. \u201cSo I\u2019d like the four of you to give me something interesting to see.\u201d</p><p>Anika eyes Tara skeptically. \u201cWell, three of us can do that,\u201d she finally answers. But Tara is scowling again.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck, Dom?\u201d she demands. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to watch. You\u2019re here to participate.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stands with her hands on her hips, her eyes shooting sparks. But I\u2019m calm.</p><p>\u201cAmy, do you really want our first time to be here.... In a dingy room with three other people?\u201d</p><p>She pauses, relaxing a tiny bit.</p><p>\u201cMake me horny,\u201d I suggest. \u201cThen we\u2019ll go back to my hotel room and take it from there.\u201d</p> <p>She hesitates, but only for a split second.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She lifts her chin. \u201cWhat would you like to see? What would make you horny, Dominic?\u201d</p><p>I settle onto a tall stool, my feet crossed in front of me.</p><p>\u201cLick her,\u201d I gesture toward Anika. \u201cThen her,\u201d and I point at Anna. \u201cThen they both can lick you. Do you have your pierced toy in your purse?\u201d</p><p>Amy shakes her head, but Anika chimes in. \u201cWe have a whole cabinet of toys.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d I smile. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a toy when the time is right.\u201d</p><p>They nod and words fade away as they pile into the bed. Clothing comes off and sex noises fill the room. Wet noises, moaning, sucking. Whimpers. Sighs.</p><p>I can see that Amy is enjoying herself, just as I can see that Tara has passed out against the wall. It doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m not here for Tara.</p><p>After everyone has been sufficiently licked, I find a toy in the cabinet, a two-headed dildo. A head for the front and one for the back.</p><p>I hand it to Anika. \u201cUse this on her. She likes it up the ass.\u201d</p><p>Amy\u2019s eyes are unfocused as the three women continue. Hands are everywhere, on soft female thighs and plump female lips. It\u2019s enough to lift my dick, but I don\u2019t concentrate on that.</p> <p>Instead, I can\u2019t help but ponder how I got to this point. A twinge of pain pulls at my belly as I think of a pair of blue eyes, innocent eyes. Eyes that loved me. Eyes that decimated me.</p><p>She would horrified if she knew I was here, if she knew how far I\u2019ve fallen into the darkness. I swallow hard and reach into my pocket, fingering her necklace and steeling my heart.</p><p>She\u2019s not here.</p><p>She\u2019ll never be here.</p><p>Bile rises from my stomach as I remember her...as I remember what happened. What I caused. I swallow the ugly taste and swallow again, hard. Forcing the memories from my mind, I turn my attention back to the present and the women debauching themselves in front of me.</p><p>No one controls Dominic Kinkaide. Not anymore. I don\u2019t have a heart left to control.</p><p>Since the women are all distracted with each other, I pull out my phone and snap pictures. And when I\u2019m done with that, I turn on the video camera.</p><p>It only takes a couple of minutes to get what I need.</p> <p>And for Amy to get what she needs. She moans and writhes on the bed as Anika brings her to orgasm, her hands twisting in the sheets beside her. Her face is sweaty, her eye make-up smeared.</p><p>As she comes, she calls out and holds my gaze. She lies still for a moment, and then the twins get up matter-of-factly, straightening their hair and putting their lingerie back on, preparing for the next customers.</p><p>Amy is limp as we walk to the car and I almost have to carry Tara.</p><p>The ride to the hotel is quiet as Amy leans into me, spent from her kinky sex with the prostitutes.</p><p>She puts a hand on my thigh as our driver pulls up to the curb in front of the hotel.</p><p>\u201cCome to my room,\u201d she says throatily, her hands smelling like sex.</p><p>I lift an eyebrow. \u201cFor what? You already came tonight. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re exhausted.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrow and she grips my leg tighter. \u201cDominic, I already told you what would happen if you don\u2019t fuck me tonight. You don\u2019t want to risk that, trust me. Because I meant what I said.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, my eyes hard as I lift her fingers from my thigh and squeeze them firmly in my hand. Not hard enough to hurt, but hard enough to get my point across.</p><p>\u201cAmy, you\u2019re a bitch. And I don\u2019t give a flying fuck if you walk away from me tonight.\u201d</p><p>She snarls, her face twisting into something ugly. \u201cDon\u2019t you know by now? I always get what I want. And trust me, if you walk away from me, I swear to Christ that I\u2019ll make up a fantastic story about being jilted by you for the studio heads. They\u2019ll be so pissed at you that they might fire you. Do you want that?\u201d</p><p>I smile now, amused as I pull out my phone. Quickly, I find the video of her with the prostitutes on my phone. She gasps as she watches Anika fucking her with the dildo.</p><p>\u201cI doubt they would be pissed at me when they hear that I broke up with you because this video leaked online. Obviously, they would understand that I just can\u2019t be linked to something so scandalous. And they wouldn\u2019t want to be linked to you, either. You\u2019d be the one fired, Amy. Not me. So tread lightly.\u201d</p><p>I pause with my fingers poised over the button that would link the video to YouTube.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get out of this car and you\u2019re never going to try and put me into a corner again. I don\u2019t like ultimatums. You\u2019re going to go your way, I\u2019m going to go mine. We\u2019ll work together. I won\u2019t say anything bad about you, and you won\u2019t say anything bad about me. And this video will stay on my phone. But the first time I get a hint that you\u2019re spreading shit about me to the studio heads, this video will be anonymously submitted to every possible gossip site online within minutes. Got it?\u201d</p><p>Amy stares at me with poison in her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking dickhead, Dominic. And you\u2019ve fucked with the wrong woman. Someday, I\u2019ll fuck you back...so hard that your asshole will bleed.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes at that visual as I open the car door and get out.</p><p>\u201cWell, until then,\u201d I say calmly, and I close my door.</p><p>I feel her astonished gaze burning into my shoulder blades as I walk away and leave her in the car with Tara passed out on the seat beside her.</p><p>I don\u2019t feel vindicated. I don\u2019t feel good. I just feel empty, like always. But at least I\u2019ve got Amy off my back and I won\u2019t have to deal with her anymore.</p><p>I make my way to my hotel room and as I do, I find police officers swarming the lobby and in the elevators. I turn to one.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>He looks at me, shaking his head wearily and speaking with a heavy accent.</p><p>\u201cAn American rock band is having a wild party with under-age girls,\u201d he growls. \u201cFecking celebrities. They think they don\u2019t follow the same rules.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, not responding, because I know that we don\u2019t. We don\u2019t follow the same rules. I get off on my floor and as soon as I do, I pick up the phone to call Tally. He answers on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a mess to clean up,\u201d I tell him. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not mine.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Shooting for the promos with Amy is uncomfortable, to say the least. She shoots daggers at me from across the room with her eyes and when we have to kiss for a picture, she bites my lip.</p><p>But I don\u2019t react. I won\u2019t give her the satisfaction.</p><p>Instead, when she is sitting in a lounger by the wall, I engage in phone sex with an old friend, Kira, from back home. Amy glares at me for a moment, then stalks away to her trailer. I grin into the phone.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll be home soon, Kira. No, I can\u2019t fly you here. I won\u2019t be here long enough. I\u2019m coming to Chicago soon. Maybe I\u2019ll even be home next weekend.\u201d</p><p>Kira laughs her familiar laugh. I\u2019ve known her for so long, she\u2019s known me since we were kids. In fact, she was Emma\u2019s best friend. She knows what Emma did to me. And she\u2019s been here to comfort me for years.</p><p>\u201cI heard Sin almost got hauled off to jail last night,\u201d she mentions. \u201cFiona called me this morning complaining about it.\u201d</p><p>I grin, trying to picture how worked up my little sister Fiona probably was. Since she\u2019d taken the job as Sin\u2019s manager, he\u2019s definitely put her through her paces.</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s got to get better about guessing girls\u2019 ages. Or he has to start taking an interest. So far, he doesn\u2019t give a flying fuck.\u201d</p><p>Kira laughs. \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t get into trouble. It\u2019s a good thing the laws there are so much more relaxed about that stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I agree. \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing that kept him out of jail. Has it hit the news there yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on some gossip sites,\u201d Kira answers. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t worry about it too much. It\u2019ll blow over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d I tell her. \u201cSin\u2019s having a party next weekend at his house. Are you coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am if you are,\u201d she purrs. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>We hang up and I head outside, through the halls that lead to the doors. The sunlight pours in through the glass, and I can see the crowds of women flocking outdoors, just waiting to get a glimpse of Amy or me.</p><p>The second I emerge, the women begin screaming and pressing toward me. Security moves me fluidly through the crush of women and within a minute, I\u2019m deposited into a waiting car.</p><p>As the darkness envelopes me, I close my eyes. As we drive away, I can still hear the women calling out my name. Asking for pictures, asking for autographs, asking for kisses and hugs.</p><p>They don\u2019t know me.</p><p>They don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve done, or what I\u2019m capable of.</p><p>They don\u2019t know any of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I close my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be home on Monday,\u201d Tally tells me firmly. \u201cShooting begins. I don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass what happened with Amy. You\u2019ll be on set and you\u2019ll be cordial to her. So have fun with your brother, clear your head and get ready to work.\u201d</p><p>I sigh into the phone. \u201cYou worry too much,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Amy won\u2019t be a problem. Shooting will go off without a hitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt better,\u201d he growls, then hangs up. I roll my eyes and toss my phone down. Tally tries to sound like an ass, but his bark is worse than his bite. At least, it is with my brothers and me.</p> <p>I finish packing and then head to Providence to have lunch before I board my plane for home. I make my way inconspicuously through the restaurant and find my favorite table.</p><p>I by-pass the hostess, but she sees me as she shows someone else their table.</p><p>She pauses at mine.</p><p>\u201cHave you spoken with Tally about me yet?\u201d she asks, her hand on my shoulder.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNot yet. I\u2019m sorry. I haven\u2019t had a chance. But I will soon. And I\u2019ll give him your number.\u201d</p> <p>And maybe I will. Tally can do what he wants with it. Melanie nods in satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cThank you. And if you need anything else from me, let me know.\u201d Her tone is suggestive. I smile.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I will. Is Alex here today?\u201d</p><p>Melanie nods as she starts to walk away. \u201cYeah. She\u2019ll be with you shortly.\u201d</p><p>As I wait, I decide to hit the men\u2019s room. As I pass down the long hall that leads to it, an office door is slightly ajar. I glance inside as I pass and am startled to see Alex sitting on the desk, her legs wrapped tightly around the manager\u2019s waist.</p><p>I freeze in place, staring.</p> <p>Alex has her arms wrapped around his neck, her wedding band glinting in the light. Her tongue is buried in manager\u2019s throat. My heart feels heavy as I remember what she\u2019d said to me before.</p><p>Sorry, dude. You\u2019re hot and all, but I\u2019m one of the few out there who believes that marriage is sacred.</p><p>Not that sacred, apparently.</p><p>She must feel someone staring, because she opens her eyes and sees me. She yanks away from the manager, her eyes wide. I don\u2019t wait. I go to the restroom, wash my hands and then head back to my table.</p><p>Alex is there within seconds.</p><p>\u201cDominic, it wasn\u2019t what you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I raise an eyebrow. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it was exactly what it looked like.\u201d</p><p>She starts to protest, to offer lame explanations about how she needs the money and the manager was going to cut her hours, but I hold up a hand.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my business,\u201d I tell her coldly. \u201cAnd actually, I\u2019ve lost my appetite today.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, I get up and leave, ignoring her protests from behind me.</p><p>As I drive away, I have to examine why I\u2019m so annoyed. Because honestly, I\u2019m pissed. And it shouldn\u2019t be my business.</p><p>What it boils down to, though, is that I thought Alex was a decent person. One of the only decent people I\u2019ve met in LA. And the fact that she\u2019s like everyone else is depressing.</p><p>Everyone wants to use everybody else. They want something, they need something. They are willing to do anything to get what they want. They\u2019ll break marriage vows, cross lines of decency, stretch bounds of propriety.</p><p>Where does it end? And is there anyone out in the world who is a decent person? A person who is good on the inside?</p><p>I\u2019m beginning to think that there\u2019s not. In fact, I\u2019m convinced of it.</p><p>I sigh as I drive to the airport and board my plane.</p><p>Soon, I\u2019ll be home, just for the weekend. I can relax, soak in the wild atmosphere of Sin\u2019s party and disappear into the shadows.</p><p>I can forget that people are greedy, black-hearted users.</p><p>I can forget it all.</p><p>As the plane takes off, I close my eyes. The weariness of the world has gotten to me. The ugly side of life, the guilt that I carry.</p><p>Sometimes, it\u2019s all just too much to bear so I cope in the only way I know how.</p><p>It\u2019s the only thing I can do.</p><p>\u201cMr. Kinkaide, is there anything else I can do for you?\u201d I open my eyes at the polite voice and find a voluptuous blonde flight attendant bent in front of me, her chest straining at the buttons of her uniform.</p><p>I meet her gaze and smile my most charming grin, the one I\u2019m known for.</p><p>\u201cWell, there is one thing.\u201d</p><p>I trail my fingers along the inside of her thigh and she smiles.</p><p>The End </p> </body></html>"]
