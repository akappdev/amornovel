I\u2019m not even sure what to say about it. Pop-Tarts and fruit snacks that don\u2019t even taste like fruit. Beans in a can\u2014gross. And s\u2019mores; they\u2019re nothing but burnt marshmallows, crackers, and messy chocolate that makes me wish I was eating the delicious s\u2019mores cake made by Delina\u2019s Bakery and Simple Cakes that was on the corner of the street I grew up on. The chocolate there was divine.</p><p>There is one thing, though, that I can certainly admit is a plus about being outdoors\u2014and it\u2019s the fourth thing I\u2019ve learned during this trip and the one thing that I\u2019ll miss when we head back to Vegas tomorrow\u2014the beauty of the night sky. Nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before can compare to it. It\u2019s so open and full of stars and the moon is so bluntly bright, way more than in the city, since there\u2019s no city lights to outshine it. It\u2019s simplistically beautiful. Plus Ethan loves looking at the stars and being with him while he lies on the ground and stares up at them makes me love the sight even more... Okay, so maybe I\u2019ve learned five things and have one more thing that I\u2019ll miss: (5) Being with Ethan all the time\u2014as long as Ethan\u2019s with me, I\u2019m fine with being cold, getting covered in pine needles, and eating beans straight from a can. I could do all those things with him forever.</p> <p>I just wish I knew that he felt the same way. But I don\u2019t know what he thinks about our future because he doesn\u2019t like talking about it and it makes me sad and bummed out whenever I think about the unknown that lies before me. About him and I and where we\u2019ll end up.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Ethan asks as he holds a stick with a marshmallow attached to the end of it, heating it just above the fire. It\u2019s his third one and it seems like he\u2019s never going to stop, like he\u2019s never going to get enough of getting his fingers sticky.</p><p>\u201cHow gross melted marshmallows are,\u201d I tell him the partial truth, relaxing back on my hands. I\u2019m sitting on a log and my hair hasn\u2019t been washed in days. There\u2019s a tent behind me, a cooler to the side of me, and campfire in front of me, blowing smoke in my face. And when I rub my thumb across my forearm, a layer of black comes off. Not one of my finest moments, but with the way Ethan\u2019s looking at me\u2014with want and love in his eyes\u2014it makes me feel very attractive, even in a hoodie and dirt-stained jeans.</p><p>Ethan cocks a dark eyebrow at me, his black hair falling into his eyes as he leans down to pick up a piece of wood by his feet and toss it into the fire. \u201cOnly you would be thinking that,\u201d he says over the crackle of the flames as he stretches his legs out and relaxes back against the cooler. He continues to roast the marshmallow in the fire, the outer part turning black and smoking. I don\u2019t say anything about him burning it, because I know that\u2019s how he likes them. Instead I just watch him, feeling myself warm inside like the melted goo on the end of his stick as he chews on his lip and observes the flames.</p><p>He\u2019s so sexy, even when he hasn\u2019t showered in days. The unshaven face, torn jeans, and wrinkled black T-shirt work so well on him. Plus his tattoos... God he\u2019s so gorgeous, all grungy and manly. I could practically have an orgasm just looking at him.</p> <p>Suddenly he smirks at me, totally busting me for checking him out, and I blink my gaze off him and focus back on the conversation.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean only I would think that?\u201d I ask, tucking a strand of my chin-length blond and black hair behind my ear. \u201cLots of people don\u2019t like melted marshmallows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true. A lot of people like them,\u201d he says, rotating the stick in his hand. \u201cYou just have weird taste in food.\u201d A teasing look rises on his face as he grins. \u201cOr maybe I should just say bad taste in food.\u201d</p><p>Scowling, I reach over to the bag of marshmallows between us, pick one up, and throw it at him. It\u2019s dark enough that he has a hard time seeing me and it ends up pegging him in the forehead. I laugh as I dust the dirt off my hands and sit up straight, feeling a little bit better.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to pay for that one,\u201d Ethan warns, and through the glow of the fire, his eyes look as black as the smoldering wood. He removes the stick from the flames as he gets to his feet. After blowing on it a few times, he carefully plucks the marshmallow from the end of the stick and mushes it between his fingers. At first I think he\u2019s going to eat it, but instead he winds around the fire pit between us, heading toward me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it.\u201d I start to get to my feet but by the time I stand up, he\u2019s within arm\u2019s reach. I stumble back, shaking my head. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I plead as he stretches his hand out toward me, the gooey marshmallow all over his fingers inching closer to my face. \u201cPlease, I don\u2019t want to get sticky.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you need to get sticky.\u201d He takes another step toward me and I match his movement, stepping back, my heels bumping against a log on the ground.</p><p>\u201cEthan, I swear to God, please don\u2019t,\u201d I plead with my hands out in front of me. \u201cThey taste so gross and my mouth will feel gross for the rest of the night.\u201d</p><p>He sighs, lowering his hand to his side. \u201cI won\u2019t just as long as you tell me what you were really thinking about earlier,\u201d he says. I open my mouth to lie to him again, but he holds up his hand. \u201cAnd don\u2019t tell me marshmallows, because I know that\u2019s not true. You had that look on your face, the one you get when you\u2019re thinking about something that upsets you.\u201d</p><p>I frown at the fact that he can read me that well and I don\u2019t want to tell him what I was thinking about. How I\u2019m worried about our future because I have no idea what\u2019s going to happen today, tomorrow, whether we\u2019ll be together or whether he even wants to be with me in the future since he refuses to talk about it. I know he loves me and sometimes I think he can\u2019t even help it. Ethan\u2019s never been one for planning much of anything and I think talking about our future means he\u2019d be planning for the future. I also think he might be scared of what we might become if we did commit\u2014what would happen to our relationship.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been so mopey ever since Chicago,\u201d he adds through my silence.</p><p>My frown deepens. He\u2019s right. I have been really mopey ever since we visited Ella and Micha in Chicago. Micha had been there for a few days playing at a concert. Seeing Ella and Micha again made me start really wondering about my future with Ethan.</p><p>It was Ella and Micha\u2019s six-month anniversary as husband and wife and they seemed so happy. It makes me sad, because even though I\u2019m happy with my relationship with Ethan, I want to be his forever, and Ethan has already made it pretty clear how he feels about weddings and marriage and all that \u201cridiculous nonsense\u201d (his words not mine).</p><p>It\u2019s not like I want to get married today or even in a year because I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not ready for that yet, but I want to know that five or ten years down the road we could be standing up in front of a minister, saying our \u201cI dos.\u201d That we could end up having what Ella and Micha have.</p> <p>\u201cJust tell me what\u2019s bothering you,\u201d he interrupts my thoughts with a fake sexy pout. \u201cOr else I\u2019m going to have to stuff this marshmallow in your mouth and then you\u2019re going to be grumpy because you\u2019ll be all sticky.\u201d</p><p>I narrow my eyes with my hands on my hips. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think so?\u201d he questions, elevating his eyebrows.</p><p>I sigh, knowing he would do it in a heartbeat and laugh at me. But it\u2019s part of why I love him, because in the end I\u2019d laugh too. \u201cFine,\u201d I say, searching for a way around this without telling the truth to avoid him getting uncomfortable and weird like he always does whenever anyone starts talking about life and the future. \u201cI\u2019m mopey because we\u2019ve been in the mountains for too long and I need a shower.\u201d</p><p>He studies me intently with his head cocked to the side. I think he\u2019s buying it until suddenly his tattooed arm springs forward and he stuffs melted marshmallow into my mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDammit, Ethan!\u201d I shout, my voice muffled by the goo. I lick my lips and wipe them with the back of my hand, trying to get rid of the stickiness while Ethan grins at me, completely proud of himself.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good look for you,\u201d he says, brushing his fingers along my bottom lip and wiping off some of the goo. He licks his fingers and I pull a face because I really do hate melted marshmallows. \u201cTastes good too,\u201d he mutters, his humor shifting to desire as he eyes my lips. Then suddenly he\u2019s cupping the back of my head and drawing me in for a kiss. The moment his lips crash into mine, I forget what we were talking about or even that we\u2019re in the mountains. I just kiss him back, willingly parting my lips to let his wet tongue slide into my sticky mouth.</p><p>\u201cReally good,\u201d he whispers against my mouth, and then kisses me again, his fingers threading through my hair and pulling gently at the roots, making my skin tingle.</p><p>My fingers wander up his back, my hands trembling with the abundance of emotions I feel for him. Want. Desire. Need. It\u2019s so terrifying. Knowing how bad I want this. Want him. And that one day maybe it could be all gone.</p> <p>In almost a desperate move, I pull him closer to me, clinging on to him, the heat of his body warming up the chilly breeze of the mountains. It also warms up my heart, makes me feel the slightest bit better and content, and reminds me that despite the fact that I might never get married\u2014that I have no idea where we\u2019re headed\u2014having moments like these with Ethan is completely and utterly worth drifting into the unknown.</p><p>I just wish it could be different.</p><p>Ethan</p><p>We\u2019ve been on the road for almost a month now, living off of the money we saved up after five months of working\u2014me in construction and working part-time as a bartender, and Lila waitressing and working at a clothing store on the weekends. We were supposed to go earlier but it took longer to save up than I\u2019d planned. But we busted our asses off, saving everything we could so we could live on the road for a month straight. It\u2019s been amazing\u2014every day is with Lila. The only thing that sucks is that we\u2019re heading back to Vegas tomorrow, back to life and the real world, popping the secluded, quiet bubble we\u2019ve built around us during our road trip.</p><p>Still, I\u2019m trying to make the best of our last night here, especially because she seems sort of down and I hate seeing her down. It worries me a little, since in the past she used pills as a way not to feel her sadness. She was addicted to them for a very long time and I was the one who helped her with the addiction, watched her struggle with it, but conquer it. She\u2019s had such a hard life and I want her to be happy all the time, even though that\u2019s impossible... I wish I could find a way to make it possible.</p> <p>After I push the marshmallow into Lila\u2019s mouth, I feel her mood lighten, which was what I was trying to accomplish. But my playfulness quickly turns to desire as she tries to lick the goo off her lips. I want to taste it\u2014taste her\u2014so I kiss her fiercely while I start to back us toward the tent. My hands travel up the back of her shirt and I savor the softness of her skin as I try to find the zipper to the door of the tent with my other hand. I manage to get the tent unzipped without disconnecting our lips; then I guide her inside and down onto her back onto the sleeping bags before covering her body with mine. I kiss her until she becomes breathless, until she\u2019s clutching my arms so tightly her fingernails are scraping my skin and she begs me to be inside her.</p><p>I nearly lose it right there. She\u2019s too beautiful for her own good and it makes lasting long nearly impossible. \u201cFuck, Lila, you\u2019re going to make this end quickly if you keep saying stuff like that,\u201d I say, pulling away to remove her jacket. She eagerly helps me, slipping her arms out of the sleeves. Then I tug her shirt off and unhook her bra, laughing when she gets the strap tangled up and stuck on her arm. Finally after a lot of laughing, I get it off and toss it aside, then lower my lips back to hers and slip my tongue deep inside her mouth, which tastes like marshmallow.</p><p>\u201cEthan...\u201d She groans, lacing her fingers through my hair as she curves her back, pressing her chest against mine.</p><p>I grip her hip with one hand, pulling her closer to me until there\u2019s no room left between us. Then my fingers slide up her side as I devour the taste of her. When I reach her breast, I graze my finger across her nipple and she gasps in response, her legs fastening around me. Our tongues tangle and our breaths mix as she grinds her hips against mine and rubs up against me. I move with her, listening to her moan and gasp and plead until I can\u2019t take it anymore. I lean back and yank my shirt off, throwing it to the side of the tent. Then I undo the button on her jeans and she impatiently helps me as I slip them down her legs. When I get to her ankles, she kicks off the jeans and strips off her panties. Then she reaches to pull me to her, but I shake my head and hold on to her ankle.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she says, practically panting.</p><p>I don\u2019t respond as I kiss a path up the inside of her leg all the way to her thigh, breathing her in with each touch of my mouth. I pause at the top, looking down at her as she stares up at me, her eyes wide and full of want. It\u2019s dark, but the glow of the moon and the fire outside glimmers in through the screen and open door on the tent. She\u2019s beautiful, flawless skin, full lips, wide, glittering eyes, and her breathing is ravenous, revealing how nervous she is and how much she trusts me to be with her like this, touching her in a way no one else has, because I love her.</p> <p>I trace my fingers across her collarbone and she sighs, her eyelids fluttering shut. \u201cI want you inside me,\u201d she whispers, her back arching against my touch. \u201cPlease, Ethan... I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d</p><p>I smile as I slowly lower my mouth to her breast. \u201cI want to touch you everywhere... God, I want you...,\u201d I breathe against her skin, savoring the moment before taking her nipple into my mouth. She moans, her breath hitching, and her fingers find my hair again as I suck a little bit harder.</p><p>Both of us are sweaty and gasping and finally my mouth leaves her nipple just so I can breathe. I want more, though. Need fucking more. So I make a path of kisses down her stomach, sucking on her skin. When I reach her thighs, I spread them and she grasps on to me as I dip my face between her legs and slide my tongue deep inside her. My eyes slip shut... my fingers tightening around her thighs... God, the taste of her never gets old\u2014never will. None of this will.</p><p>I continue to taste her while her hips writhe against my mouth, until I feel like I\u2019m going to explode; then I pull away and kiss my way up her stomach and chest to her mouth. Her lips part as I slide my tongue in for a kiss that makes both of us groan. I work to get the button of my jeans undone as she grips my arms, holding me to her, kissing me fervently. I only pull away to take my jeans and boxers off. Then I get a condom out of my wallet, put it on, and situate back between her legs.</p><p>With one hard thrust, I\u2019m sliding deep inside her. Our lips connect somewhere in the middle and I grip her thigh, bending one of her legs up to my side as I rock into her. She rhythmically moves with me, our skin dampening with sweat, until we become lost in each other over and over again. Eventually we cry out together as I give one final thrust inside her, then we lose ourselves completely.</p><p>Afterward, I lie still inside her with my head on her chest, feeling her pulse race as she rests against the sleeping bags, running her fingers through my hair. \u201cYou have the softest hair,\u201d she whispers with an exhausted sigh.</p><p>I push up from her and look her in the eyes. \u201cIs that supposed to be a compliment? Because I\u2019m not sure if a guy\u2019s hair should be soft,\u201d I tease.</p><p>She continues to rub her fingers through my hair. \u201cYeah, it should be. And yours is the softest.\u201d</p> <p>I chuckle under my breath and then return my head back onto her chest. It gets really quiet as she continues to run her fingers through my hair. I listen to the fire crackling outside, the sound of an owl in the distance, and the river flowing through the trees.</p><p>\u201cGod, it sucks that we have to head home tomorrow,\u201d I say, letting out a loud breath.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re sad,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sort of sad that we won\u2019t be spending as much time together, but at the same time I\u2019m really, really excited about taking a real shower.\u201d</p><p>I smile, shaking my head. \u201cNot me. If I could, I\u2019d keep doing this forever.\u201d I yawn, feeling exhaustion take me over. \u201cAlthough, I\u2019ll admit. I do sort of get sick of driving. I\u2019d love to take a break from that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou will,\u201d she says. \u201cAs soon as we get home, we can go on a driving strike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that sounds nice, but it\u2019ll have to be after I go back home for my mom\u2019s birthday in August.\u201d</p><p>Her hand stops moving through my hair. \u201cYou\u2019re going back to Star Grove in August?\u201d</p><p>I glance up at her. \u201cYeah... didn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t read her expression, but she seems tense. \u201cNo, you never mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>Shit. I think I might\u2019ve messed up on that one. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say. \u201cI thought I told you about it a while ago.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head, not looking at me but up at the tent roof. \u201cWell, you didn\u2019t.\u201d She pauses, and I can feel that she\u2019s struggling to breathe. \u201cSo you\u2019re going in August?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah...\u201d I\u2019m not sure what to do to make her feel better. I didn\u2019t mean to not tell her. Sometimes I just sort of fuck up, forgetting that I can\u2019t just do things based upon what I want\u2014that I\u2019m in a relationship now. \u201cI\u2019m only going to be gone for a few days. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d It\u2019s all she says, which makes the situation way worse, because she\u2019s obviously bothered by this. But I wonder if it\u2019s just because I didn\u2019t tell her about it or because I\u2019m going alone. Or maybe it\u2019s something else entirely\u2014she\u2019s been upset a lot lately. \u201cLila, I can tell something\u2019s bugging you, so will you please just talk to me?\u201d I skim my finger across her cheekbone, causing her to shudder. \u201cYou seem upset and if you\u2019d just tell me why, maybe I could help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine... I promise.\u201d She closes her eyes and inhales deeply and I think she\u2019s on the verge of crying.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d just talk to me more about stuff,\u201d I say quietly, not just hoping she\u2019ll tell me what\u2019s bothering her now but hoping she\u2019ll finally break and spill what\u2019s been putting her in a downer mood for the last couple of weeks as well. \u201cYou usually do.\u201d</p><p>But she stays silent and I let her play with my hair for a few more moments before I carefully slip out of her and roll onto my back. She follows me, hitching her leg over my stomach; then she traces a circular pattern across my sweaty chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been so cranky,\u201d she whispers in a choked voice. \u201cMy head\u2019s just been in a really weird place. And I don\u2019t care if you go see your mom on her birthday\u2014you should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to be cranky sometimes,\u201d I reply, wrapping my arm around her and pulling her closer to me. \u201cBut you should really just talk to me and let me help make you feel better. No matter what\u2019s bugging you, I\u2019m here for you.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and nuzzles her face against my chest. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it tonight, but maybe tomorrow.\u201d She sounds so sad and it hurts, not knowing what\u2019s causing it. If it\u2019s something because of me.</p> <p>Whatever\u2019s bothering her\u2014and has been bothering her\u2014she doesn\u2019t want to tell me, and even though Lila has opened up to me about a lot of things, I still know from past experience that she can keep a secret like no one else. All those years of popping pills and no one ever knew.</p><p>Minutes later she falls asleep in my arms and I stroke my finger up and down her back, listening to the quiet around us that only being in the mountains can bring, attempting to sort through my thoughts.</p><p>She\u2019s been really up and down since Chicago, ever since we went to visit Ella and Micha a couple of weeks ago. I\u2019m not exactly sure why, but I think it might have to do with the fact that she wants to get married, something that was brought up during Ella and Micha\u2019s wedding last Christmas. Yeah, I knew Lila had certain things she wanted out of life, but I hadn\u2019t really thought she\u2019d need to say \u201cI do\u201d one day, until she started rambling about it while she was helping Ella plan things for the wedding. For a week straight, it\u2019s all I heard about\u2014that and babies, since Ella\u2019s sister-in-law was pregnant. I tried to shrug and nod whenever she brought it up, and it seemed to be working for me, until she flat out asked me for a response.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you see us in five years?\u201d she\u2019d asked while we were tying bows at Micha\u2019s mom\u2019s kitchen table.</p><p>I\u2019d glanced up from the bow I was tying, a little startled by her question. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>Lila peered up at me with her beautiful blue eyes. \u201cYou and I as a couple. Do you think we\u2019ll still be together in five years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure...\u201d I\u2019d squirmed uncomfortably in the chair. \u201cI mean, we\u2019ve only been dating for like a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDating, yeah,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been friends for longer and Ella and Micha were friends first, which makes the fact that they\u2019re getting married so young understandable, at least from my point of view.\u201d</p> <p>I finished tying the bow before I spoke again, deciding just to be honest with her. \u201cHonestly, Lila, I don\u2019t think I can ever see myself getting married... if that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting at.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure it was. She was utterly confusing me.</p><p>She shrugged, reaching for a roll of ribbon. \u201cI wasn\u2019t getting at anything. Just wondering, since you seem so against marriage.\u201d She swallowed hard, looking upset. \u201cGlad to know where you stand.\u201d</p><p>I sighed as she pushed her chair away from the table and got to her feet. \u201cLila, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d held up her hand, silencing me. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting a proposal anytime in the near future, but the fact that you can never see yourself getting married sucks.\u201d Then she\u2019d left the room and I felt like the biggest asshole.</p><p>Still do.</p><p>But I can\u2019t help how I feel. Or how I think I feel. I\u2019m honestly unsure of what I want or how I can figure it out, since I hate figuring heavy stuff out. I don\u2019t like complications and weddings and marriage, and forevers are more than complicated, at least from what I\u2019ve seen. My parents\u2019 marriage was full of fighting and abuse and that\u2019s the last thing I want. Plus, making things really complicated means there\u2019s a chance they could fall apart and then I\u2019d be left dealing with the outcome. I had a girlfriend, London, who I thought I loved\u2014although now that I\u2019m in love with Lila, I\u2019m not so sure I was really in love with London\u2014and then she fell out a window and got amnesia and everything I had with her was lost. It was really hard to get over. If something like that happened with Lila and me... if I lost her in any way... I\u2019m not sure I could ever get over it.</p><p>There are so many reasons why marriage and a future scare the shit out of me and I don\u2019t think can\u2019t picture myself doing it. I really can\u2019t.</p><p>Lila eventually let the marriage thing go, obviously, since she\u2019s here with me seven months later, but I can tell whenever the future comes up that she\u2019s waiting for me to tell her what I want, but I still don\u2019t have an answer to give her. I want her. That much I know. She\u2019s amazing and smart and brave. She\u2019s more beautiful than she realizes and even though I hate to admit it, I love giving in to her and letting her have her way... most of the time anyway.</p><p>But I\u2019ve planned on living my life carefree and doing whatever I want, whenever I feel like it, like I am now without worrying about other stuff. And if five years down the road, I want to get up one day and take off in my truck and just drive off into the unknown by myself, I still want to be able to do it without hurting anyone or worrying about what will happen to those around me\u2014worrying about life. That I might be breaking someone. Or that I won\u2019t be able to because of my own feelings and attachments to certain things. But if I\u2019m married, then that means I\u2019ll have a wife to think about, a steady job, a house, and one day maybe even kids. God... I\u2019m not sure how I feel about that.</p><p>The only thing I am sure about is that I never, ever want to lose Lila. She\u2019s the only girl who\u2019s ever made me feel like a relationship is worth the risk. And she\u2019s not even just my girlfriend. She\u2019s my best friend. The only person I\u2019ve ever felt comfortable enough with to talk openly to. I tell her as much personal stuff as I tell my journal. But if we don\u2019t want the same things, I\u2019m not sure how long I\u2019ll be able to hold on to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 2</p><p>Lila</p><p>It\u2019s our last day here\u2014on the road together\u2014and I\u2019m both sad for it to end and kind of glad to be going back so I can take a real shower and eat food that doesn\u2019t come in a can. I\u2019m trying to keep as upbeat as I can even after my little meltdown last night. I didn\u2019t really mean to almost cry last night in the tent, but then he started talking about how he was going up to Star Grove for his mom\u2019s birthday. He never told me he was, which stung a little. But the worst part is that he didn\u2019t even invite me to go with him. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s doing it on purpose. I just think that he\u2019s not really thinking about the future as an us yet. It painfully reminded me even more that I have no idea where we\u2019re going to end up\u2014if I\u2019ll ever visit his parents\u2019 with him. And what added more heartache to the situation was having him near me, touching me like he does. It sets off how much I want things to always be this way.</p><p>Forever and always. Just him and I.</p> <p>I just wish he felt the same way, but I\u2019m starting to wonder more and more if he doesn\u2019t.</p><p>Still, I pull myself together and manage to make it through breakfast smiling. The only time I let my mood drop is when it\u2019s time to get cleaned up, but that\u2019s for an entirely different reason. No matter what section of the country we\u2019re in, all places share one thing in common. The streams and ponds are freezing. Taking a bath outside and actually staying in long enough to get clean is a challenge. It takes a lot of mental preparation. As I strip off my clothing and stare at the translucent water rolling over the rocks in front of me, I shiver, even though the sun is beating down my bare body.</p><p>It\u2019s an amazing sight, really. The small pond is tucked between rocks and trees, the water a clear blue, and there\u2019s this little waterfall toward the back. But I know from experience that the beauty of it is going to be lost the moment I step in and I start to freeze.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you were sexy as hell before,\u201d Ethan says from behind me. \u201cBut that tattoo makes you look so goddamn gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>I smile to myself, remembering how I\u2019d finally decided to get a tattoo right before we left for this road trip. It took me a while to figure out what I wanted, but then decided on a sparrow when I found out it meant freedom. It seems fitting since I\u2019ve never felt freer in my life. Per Ethan\u2019s suggestion, I got it right between my shoulder blades. It hurt, but it was totally worth it because with each prick of the needle, I felt freer and freer from my dark past and my parents\u2019 control.</p> <p>I am free now.</p><p>\u201cYou know, if you want, you can just stand there all day,\u201d Ethan adds, and I can hear the soft sound of his footsteps inching closer to me. \u201cYou make the view a hell of a lot better.\u201d</p><p>I look over my shoulder at him, giving him a dark, playful look. \u201cWhat if some hikers came up here and saw me naked? Would you still want me to stand here naked?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s standing not too far off behind me near the tree line, wearing a dark green shirt with a faded logo, cargo shorts, and boots that are untied. He\u2019s also got his journal in his hands. \u201cThat depends,\u201d he says, taking a step forward, his intent gaze making me feel like I\u2019m sweltering.</p><p>\u201cOn what?\u201d I\u2019m breathless just from the way he\u2019s looking at me.</p><p>He cocks his head to the side, a grin gradually rising on his face as he leisurely scrolls over my body. \u201cOn if the hikers are guys or women. If it\u2019s a bunch of women, then I\u2019d tell them to go ahead and enjoy the view.\u201d His grin broadens as I roll my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a pervert,\u201d I say, crossing my hands over my chest.</p><p>He reaches me, assessing me, and the desire in his eyes makes me shiver. \u201cYou like that I am\u2014it totally turns you on when I say dirty things to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does not,\u201d I lie, biting back a smile.</p><p>He arches his brow. \u201cIf that\u2019s not true, then why are your nipples all perky?\u201d He reaches out and pinches one of them softly, causing me to shudder, and a small gasp escapes my lips.</p><p>\u201cYou want to get in with me?\u201d I ask as he cups my breast and leans in to suck on my neck. Please, get in with me. Oh my God, please...</p><p>He kisses me until I become breathless and then moves back with a glazed look in his eyes. \u201cMaybe in a bit.\u201d He\u2019s totally enjoying the fact that he\u2019s making me all hot and bothered. \u201cI\u2019m just going to watch you while I write for a while.\u201d</p><p>I frown, a little disappointed as I back toward the water. \u201cYou\u2019re such a tease.\u201d</p><p>Pleased with himself, he heads over to one of the large rocks next to the stream that pools into the pond and climbs up on it. When he gets to the top, he sits down and situates the journal on his lap. Then he takes a pen out of his pocket, bites off the cap, and presses the tip of it to the paper as he watches me with an I\u2019m waiting for you to get into the water so I can watch you wet and naked look.</p> <p>Sighing, I approach the edge of the stream, where the water meets the dirt. Mud oozes through my toes and rocks scrape at my bare feet as I dip my toe into the water. My body instantly jolts from the chill as I take a deep breath and wade in, squealing and sucking in huge lungfuls of air. When I reach the middle, where the water goes up to my waist, I turn around and find Ethan laughing at me.</p><p>\u201cA little cold?\u201d he asks through his laughter.</p><p>I shake my head, then decide the best way to get even is to torture him, so even though it\u2019s not comfortable to do in cold water, I dip my head back into the water, arch my back, and stick my chest up in the air. As the water soaks my hair, it gives me a brain freeze, like I\u2019ve just guzzled down an ICEE, but it\u2019s worth it when I stand back up to see Ethan looks a little flustered.</p><p>I smile to myself and then turn around and plunge under, letting the water wash over my body, so cold not a single bad thought can form in my head. Moments later, I hear a soft thud from behind me. When I turn around, Ethan has hopped off the rock and is peeling off his shirt. Without taking his shorts off, he walks into the water, wincing from the cold as it reaches his waist.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask as he wades toward me. \u201cI thought you were just going to watch and write for a while.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t speak, just shakes his head. His eyes are locked on mine and full of desire as he moves toward me. When he reaches me, he gives no warning, crashing his lips against mine and scooping me up in his arms. The sun hits my skin as I\u2019m picked up out of the water and my legs fasten around his waist. He holds onto me with one hand as he feels my side and skims my breast with his other hand, kissing me until I can\u2019t breathe. I clutch him as his fingers drift from my side, to my hip, to my thigh. Then bracing me in one arm, he slips a finger deep inside me.</p><p>I gasp as I tangle my fingers through his hair and desperately try to grasp on to him. One of my legs slides back down into the water and I stand on my tiptoes, clutching onto his shoulders, with my other leg hitched around his hip. His fingers move inside me, driving me to the edge as he buries his head into the crook of my neck, his warm breath caressing my chilly skin. I groan. I plead. I beg for more and he gives it to me, slipping another finger into me, and I move my hips with his rhythm until he pushes me over the edge. I forget about everything. Nothing exists at this moment except for him and I and the connection we\u2019ve shared since the moment we met over two years ago.</p><p>It\u2019s perfect until he pulls his fingers out of me and leans back a little, letting my other leg slide down back into the water. Then I just feel cold again.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t resist,\u201d he says, tucking a strand of my wet hair behind my ear. \u201cYou looked too tempting not to touch... God, I have such a hard time keeping my hands off you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about you?\u201d I say, putting my hand on his lean chest.</p><p>\u201cYou can pay me back later,\u201d he says with a wink and a grin.</p><p>I smile and then he kisses me before backing away to the shore, his shorts soaking wet and hanging at his hips. Beads of water drip down his chest and tattooed side as he makes his way back to the rocks, smiling at me like he\u2019s so happy. Just like I should be. And I am. But every perfect moment could be our last one together and that makes me sad.</p><p>After he climbs back up on the rocks, I start scrubbing my body down with water, while Ethan starts to write. I finish up quickly, then wade back to the shore and out of the water. The frigid air hits my body like a wall of snow and I scurry for the towel I hung up on a tree branch. I wrap it around me and wring my hair out before heading over to Ethan. He still has his shirt off, his wet shorts drying in the sunlight peeking through the tree branches above him. He\u2019s got his head tipped down, his black hair falling into his eyes as he jots down words, losing touch with reality like he always does whenever he writes. I climb onto the rock beside him and sit down next to him, leaning over my shoulder to get a peek at what he\u2019s writing, even though he never wants me to see. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you writing about today?\u201d I ask, and he jumps, like he didn\u2019t even realize I was up here.</p><p>He hurries to finish what he\u2019s writing and closes the journal. \u201cNothing important,\u201d he says. \u201cI was just thinking about stuff.... About going back home... returning to the city and life...\u201d He gazes out at the pine trees to the side of us, looking really sad and lost. \u201cWe should probably get going if we want to make it back and have a little time to relax before we go back to normal life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to go back?\u201d I ask, leaning back to look him in the eyes. \u201cYou seem so sad about it.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs and when he meets my gaze, I can see his sadness deepen. \u201cWe kind of have to, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnless we want to lose our jobs,\u201d I reply sadly, because even though I can\u2019t wait to get back and take a real shower, I\u2019ll also really miss my time alone with him. \u201cI mean, Denny was understanding and everything, but he\u2019s going to flip if I call him up and ask him for more time off.\u201d I actually lucked out with Denny, my boss at this restaurant where I waitress. When I told him my plans for this road trip, he understood and said something about only being young once. He\u2019s having his niece fill in for me while I\u2019m gone and promised me I\u2019d still have my job when I get back, but I doubt that\u2019d be the case if I stayed away too much longer.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m supposed to start work on that house being built up on Maple Street in a week.\u201d He sighs heavy heartedly. \u201cI guess it\u2019s time to return to the real world.\u201d He pauses, assessing me. \u201cAlthough...\u201d He trails off, cracking the tiniest smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask as he stares at me with this strange look on his face. \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, his smile expanding. \u201cBecause I was thinking about taking another route back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of route?\u201d I ask curiously.</p> <p>He bites on the end of his pen, studying me, his eyes following the beads of water rivering from my hair down my chest. \u201cI was thinking maybe the beach sort of route.\u201d</p><p>My mood perks up and it seems to boost his too. \u201cAre you being serious? You want to stop by the beach on our way home?\u201d</p><p>He nods, his smile breaking all the way through. \u201cYeah... you\u2019ve been saying how much you hate the cold and so I figured we could head down south to South Carolina and spend a day there before we head west... maybe to the beach you said you went to as a kid.\u201d</p><p>I attempt not to smile, but I can\u2019t help it. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you remembered that.\u201d</p><p>He sets his journal aside and scoots closer to me. \u201cHow could I not?\u201d he asks, cupping my cheek. \u201cIt was probably the only pleasant story you\u2019ve ever told me about your childhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I went on the vacation with my friend\u2019s family,\u201d I tell him. \u201cNot my own family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI remember,\u201d he says. \u201cYou said it was your favorite vacation ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was... I actually felt happy for once... and content.\u201d I pause. \u201cAlthough, this one easily tops it.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a questioning look. \u201cI\u2019m kind of surprised you said that.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m baffled. \u201cWhy? I\u2019ve been having fun and I thought you knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did know, but...\u201d He struggles, shifting his weight, and then he places his hands on the tops of my thighs. \u201cYou\u2019ve been so upset since Chicago... and then last night...\u201d He waits for me to explain, but I still don\u2019t feel like I want to tell him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not because of the vacation,\u201d I promise. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not a huge fan of the mountains, I\u2019m still having fun with you... everything is fun with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why does it seem like you\u2019ve been upset lately?\u201d he asks, searching my eyes for something. \u201cEver since we visited Ella and Micha. And you won\u2019t talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan...\u201d I trail off, unsure. \u201cI just don\u2019t think I can talk to you about this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asks, starting to get frustrated. \u201cGoddammit, Lila. I wish you\u2019d just tell me because it\u2019s driving me crazy. You tell me a lot of things and now suddenly you won\u2019t... it makes me think it has something to do with me.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t talk to you about this... I just can\u2019t...\u201d I\u2019m growing worried because I can feel a fight approaching, just like the one we had back in December.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asks, but there\u2019s wariness in his voice and I wonder if he already knows what I\u2019m thinking about.</p><p>\u201cBecause the last time I brought it up we ended up fighting,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to fight.\u201d</p><p>He tenses and I know he\u2019s figured out what\u2019s been bothering me, that it\u2019s about marriage and our future. He lets out a slow breath and I feel like I\u2019m going to cry because I want him to just say it. Lila, I want you for the long run. It doesn\u2019t have to be Lila, will you marry me? I just want to know what\u2019s ahead of us, more than just the next few days.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do to make you feel better?\u201d he asks with sincerity.</p><p>I shake my head, sucking back the tears. \u201cNothing really.\u201d And it\u2019s the blunt truth because even if I made him say it, if he doesn\u2019t mean it, then it\u2019s nothing more than words. \u201cJust let me think through my thoughts and figure stuff out... figure out what I want.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not even sure what I mean, but he looks like I\u2019ve just told him I\u2019m breaking up with him. Frowning, he gets to his feet and picks up his journal. I think he\u2019s going to take off, but then he extends his hand to me and helps me to my feet.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go pack up and hit the road; otherwise we won\u2019t have time for the beach,\u201d he says, avoiding eye contact with me.</p><p>I nod, a lump forming in my throat because I still have no clue where we\u2019re headed. To the beach in a few days. Then what? Home. And what happens when we get home? We don\u2019t talk about it, so I have no idea. No idea what he wants, if he\u2019ll ever want what I want. If maybe we\u2019re just wasting our time.</p><p>Ethan</p><p>Lila needs to figure stuff out. Figure out what she wants. What the fuck does that mean? I\u2019m not even sure what the hell just happened between us. One minute I have my fingers inside her because the need to touch her was so overwhelming it was worth getting wet and cold, and then the next thing I know we\u2019re arguing and it feels like she might be thinking about breaking up with me. Or wanting to take a break. And I don\u2019t want a break. I just want to keep doing what we\u2019re doing. I\u2019m having fun and that\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted out of life. To enjoy it.</p><p>When I was younger, and pictured my road trip, I\u2019d always pictured doing it myself. But then Lila entered my life and things sort of shifted when I fell in love with her. It was one of the things that made me realize I was in love with her\u2014because being alone didn\u2019t seem as appealing as being with her.</p><p>After we pack up the truck, we head down the mountain, barely saying more than two words to each other. As I drive down the road, heading toward the town on the outskirts of the mountains, I can\u2019t help but wonder if in the future, Lila is going to give me an ultimatum. If she\u2019ll demand that I either marry her or she\u2019ll leave me... Fuck, what if she just leaves and never even gives me a choice? What if one day I wake up and she\u2019s gone? Jesus, I never thought I\u2019d turn into this guy, the one who gets upset at the idea of his girlfriend walking out on him. But after what Lila said on the rock... the idea that she could be thinking about ending it... I\u2019ve definitely turned into that guy and I\u2019m about to panic. Still, the idea of fully committing is scaring the shit of me too.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean for it to sound like that,\u201d Lila suddenly blurts out from the passenger seat, finally turning her head toward me. \u201cBack at the rock... what I said... I\u2019m not trying to figure out what I want. I know what I want\u2014you. And I\u2019m sorry if I made you think I was questioning that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry,\u201d I say, gripping the steering wheel as I guide my truck around the corner. \u201cYou were just being honest, right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shakes her head and inches across the seat toward me. \u201cI wasn\u2019t, though... I was just frustrated because I worry... about stuff...\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows furrow as I downshift for a steep hill. \u201cAbout what? Marriage stuff?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs and then looks down at her hands as she picks at her fingernails. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to end up alone. That\u2019s all. I mean, if I don\u2019t have you, then all I really have is my sister, but you know how she is\u2014she barely even has time to talk to me on the phone. And Ella\u2019s got her own life now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t ever be alone,\u201d I promise, reaching over and taking her hand. \u201cYou\u2019ll always have me, no matter what happens.\u201d</p> <p>She presses her lips together and it looks like she\u2019s on the verge of crying. \u201cI just want to make sure that I have you forever... that you and I\u201d\u2014she glances up at me, gesturing her hand between us\u2014\u201cthat this will never change because I don\u2019t want it to change. I love being with you, Ethan. Even when I\u2019m filthy and smell like a garbage can.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s midafternoon and the sunlight reflects in her blue eyes, her blond hair is pulled up in a messy bun on her head, and she\u2019s wearing a tank top with no bra and cutoffs. Her eyes are a little wide and have the slightest bit of fear in them because she\u2019s basically handing me her emotions to do with as I please.</p><p>She\u2019s fucking perfect and hearing her say that she doesn\u2019t want anything to change between us makes me want to pull the car over and fuck her again and again. Whether I\u2019ll admit it aloud or not, I want this\u2014her and I. I want to travel with her. Kiss her. Touch her. Whenever I want. But at the same time I\u2019m terrified. And I hate that I\u2019m so scared of the idea, the idea of wanting someone so much. Yet, I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019ve been through too much\u2014seen too much with my parents\u2014that I get what comes with wanting someone so much. I\u2019d basically be opening myself up to anything, even heartbreak. And Lila too. And the last thing I ever want to do is hurt her. \u201cI want it too,\u201d I admit, and she releases a trapped breath in her chest. \u201cBut I\u2019m also worried... about what we could become. I just don\u2019t want to rush stuff, you know. I don\u2019t want to get so caught up in doing what people think they\u2019re supposed to do, like...\u201d I trail off, getting a little uncomfortable. \u201cLike getting married and settling down... I don\u2019t want to do it too fast and ruin the perfect we have right now.\u201d</p><p>She nods, understanding, because I\u2019ve told her enough about my mom and dad and their shitty relationship that she gets my fear of becoming like them. \u201cI know... I\u2019m worried too.\u201d She sits back in the seat and faces forward. \u201cMy parents weren\u2019t that great and the last thing I want to do is become them.\u201d She pauses and it makes me nervous, wondering what else she\u2019s going to say. \u201cHowever, at the same time, I look at Ella and Micha and they\u2019re so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say, and then frown. \u201cBut how do we know that we\u2019ll be happy instead of angry and sad all the time, like our parents? I just want to make sure that I\u2014that we\u2014don\u2019t turn out like them. Hating each other... yelling at each other... hurting each other... I want to make sure that we\u2019re in the right place where we both want the same things.\u201d And I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m there yet.</p> <p>She swallows hard. \u201cWell, we can\u2019t know for sure\u2014no one can see the future. We just have to be willing to take the risk.\u201d</p><p>She waits for me to agree and I want to tell her right then and there that I\u2019m ready to take that risk. That I want to be with her forever, because I know I do, but images of my mom and dad screaming at each other surface and then I picture Lila and me in the same place, yelling at each other because I want one thing and she wants something else. My lips end up staying sealed, refusing to part and just finally say what I want.</p><p>I stew in my own regrets for the rest of our journey down the mountain while Lila stares out the window, looking sadder the more time goes by. By the time we reach the small town at the foothills, it\u2019s getting late. The sky is bright orange and pink as the sun sets behind us. The few buildings, gas stations, and houses lining the street are shadowed by the mountains and the town is pretty quiet, only a few vehicles driving up and down the street.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to stop at that caf\u00e9 up there?\u201d I ask, pointing at a small neon sign at the entry to Dina\u2019s Caf\u00e9 and Diner. Then I force a smile, even though it hurts. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re getting sick of canned food and Pop-Tarts.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs, finally looking at me for the first time since we stopped talking. I realize she\u2019s had her head turned because she\u2019s been crying. The evidence of it is all over her bloodshot eyes and red, streaked cheeks and it\u2019s all my fault.</p><p>\u201cDinner sounds good, I guess,\u201d she says, her voice strained.</p> <p>I pull the truck into the parking lot and turn off the engine. As she turns to get out of the car, I reach for her arm and stop her. She freezes but doesn\u2019t look at me.</p><p>\u201cBaby, look at me,\u201d I say. Lila is actually the only person I\u2019ve ever called that, but mainly because she\u2019s the only girl I\u2019ve ever genuinely been in love with, at least in a way that using endearing pet names doesn\u2019t seem totally cheesy.</p><p>She wipes her eyes with her free hand and then reluctantly turns to me in the seat. It kills me to see the sadness in her eyes. Any other girl and I\u2019d probably have bailed out by now. Too much pressure and heavy emotions, but with Lila, I don\u2019t want to lose her. Ever.</p><p>I pull her across the seat toward me, not stopping until she\u2019s right beside me. Then I take a deep breath and do the best I can to explain how I feel. \u201cI promise I\u2019m not going anywhere. You and I have lots of road trips and fights and hot steamy sex ahead of us.\u201d I mentally shake my head at myself. If I was writing it down, it would have sounded a hell of a lot better. \u201cYou can even come on the road trip with me to Star Grove if you want. Granted, you\u2019ll have to put up with my mom and dad\u2019s arguing and shit.\u201d</p><p>The corners of her lips quirk into an almost smile. \u201cYou want me to go with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always want you to go with me,\u201d I say. \u201cI just hate taking you up there around all the fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle fighting,\u201d she insists, seeming so much happier. \u201cI just want to make sure that you want me to come with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d I say, tucking a strand of her hair behind her ear. Then I aim a teasing grin at her. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going anywhere. As much as you\u2019re a pain in the ass, I always want you with me.\u201d</p> <p>Her smile breaks through and she cups my face in her hands and pulls my lips to hers. She kisses me until I become breathless, which is the fucking pussiest thing to say, yet it\u2019s fucking happening.</p><p>Then she\u2019s pulling away, blinking her eyes with a small smile on her lips and all I want to do is hold on to her. \u201cAll right, you won me over. I\u2019ll drop the whole marriage and future talk for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just going to drop it like that?\u201d I ask, stunned she\u2019s making it that easy.</p><p>Her shoulders rise and fall as she shrugs. \u201cYeah, I mean, you said we have a lot of road trips ahead of us and that\u2019s all I really wanted to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but...\u201d I drift off, wondering why I\u2019m not letting it go, when she\u2019s dropping it like I wanted... or thought I\u2019d wanted. But she\u2019s got me thinking about stuff and now it seems hard just to stop processing where I see us down the road together. Taking trips. Kissing. Talking. Living in a cabin somewhere in the mountains where I could watch her bathe in a pond all the time. Is that where I see myself? Is that where I see us?</p><p>Dammit, where is my head going?</p><p>She slides over to the passenger door and hops out of the truck with a spring in her walk and her ass shaking in the pair of cutoffs she\u2019s wearing. And I\u2019m left watching her and wondering what the fuck is wrong with my head.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Lila</p><p>I\u2019m feeling a little bit better, despite the fact that I\u2019m starving. I\u2019ve never been a fan of caf\u00e9s but right now I\u2019d settle for anything that didn\u2019t come in a box or a can. After we\u2019re seated in a booth, I search the menu, my belly grumbling as the waitress fills up our waters. We order our drinks and then I run my fingers along the list of appetizers, singing along with the song playing through the speakers, one that I don\u2019t know the name of but have heard a ton of times. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ethan watches me with a curious expression, the sleeves of his plaid shirt pushed up so I can see all his tattoos and the lean muscles in his arms. \u201cSince when do you know \u2018Creep\u2019 by Radiohead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always listening to it,\u201d I point out. \u201cAnd somehow, despite my protest, the lyrics have managed to get themselves stuck inside my head.\u201d</p><p>He gives me this strange look, like he\u2019s realizing something that scares him. Then he fixes his attention on the menu in front of him, his forehead creasing. He reads for a few moments and then lets out a frustrated breath, shutting his menu and turning in the booth toward me. \u201cOkay, was that like some sort of reverse psychology or something?\u201d</p><p>I gape at him, confused. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p> <p>He roughly rakes his fingers through his hair, seeming irritated. \u201cThat stuff back in the truck... about being okay with not knowing now...\u201d He lowers his arm onto the table. \u201cAbout being okay not knowing if we\u2019ll be together five or ten years down the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat I meant was that I felt better because you said we had a lot of stuff ahead of us and that\u2019s all I really wanted\u2014to know we had some sort of future ahead of us.\u201d</p><p>He still looks confused, his lips parting, and I can tell he\u2019s about to say something that\u2019s going to either completely and utterly make me happy for a very long time or break me apart. But then he snaps his jaw shut when the waitress returns to take our orders. I order mozzarella sticks, a chicken sandwich, and piece of chocolate cake, and Ethan orders enough to feed a small village.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have leftovers for the road,\u201d he says after the waitress leaves. \u201cThat way we don\u2019t have to stop a lot.\u201d</p><p>I glare at him. \u201cPlease. Not the no-stopping-unless-we\u2019re-in-dire-need policy. I revoked that after the near-peeing-my-pants accident.\u201d</p> <p>He laughs, recollecting the memory with a thoughtful look on his face. \u201cHey, there was an upside to that,\u201d he says. \u201cI got to watch you pee in a cup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got to see me try peeing in a cup,\u201d I remind him, narrowing my eyes. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it always works for me,\u201d he says, still grinning. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault your girl part can\u2019t aim right.\u201d</p><p>I maliciously reach over and grab his manly part, giving it a good rub to mess with his head. \u201cNeed I remind you what my girl part can do to your boy part?\u201d I take his hand and put it between my legs; then I smile when he starts to touch me between the legs. We\u2019re completely hidden by the table, although the orgasmic look on his face might give us away.</p><p>\u201cNever make fun of my girl part again,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd stop calling it a girl part. It\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to call it?\u201d he asks with a dark grin. \u201cYour wet, dripping\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I slap my hand over his mouth, stifling a laugh. \u201cNot so loud.\u201d</p><p>Ethan has this thing with never getting embarrassed in public. In fact, one time he proceeded to tell me, in a very loud voice, the various positions he was going to fuck me in over the course of the night. He then proceeded to give me a demonstration of what I was going to sound like when I was coming. We were in a McDonald\u2019s and a lot of people weren\u2019t very happy about it. Still, he did make good with his word and tried all the positions on me and I did scream out just like he had predicted.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d he asks, his fingers wandering to my side. They dig inward and he guides me closer to him in the booth until I\u2019m practically on his lap.</p><p>\u201cHow you did me that one night in all those different, crazy positions,\u201d I say, biting on my lip when his grip tightens even more and hot tingles course up and down my inner thighs.</p><p>Hunger consumes his eyes. \u201cYou want to do it again?\u201d he asks. \u201cI\u2019ve got a ton more positions I can show you.\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip harder, so hard, in fact, I taste blood in my mouth, feeling the shift in our mood and wanting it more than anything. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have a hotel room.\u201d</p><p>He glances around the mostly vacant caf\u00e9 like he\u2019s almost forgotten where we were. Then his eyes wander to the window at the front of the diner where it\u2019s dark, a faint stream of light trickling in from the lampposts in the parking lot. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we get a room?\u201d he asks, turning his attention back to me.</p><p>The look in his eyes pushes me nearly over the edge. I swear if he doesn\u2019t tone it down, I\u2019m going to have an orgasm right here at the table, in a restaurant full of people. Granted, it\u2019d be worth it. \u201cI thought we had to hit the road tonight?\u201d</p> <p>He shakes his head, his expression filling with lust and making my body feel like it\u2019s going to combust. \u201cWe can still make it back in time... we\u2019ll just have to make a few less stops...\u201d His gaze flicks to my breasts. I\u2019m not wearing a bra and my nipples have gotten so hard that they\u2019re visible through the thin fabric.</p><p>His fingers find them and trace them in soft circular motions, while he waits for me to respond.</p><p>\u201cWe can do that,\u201d I say, but it comes out a groan and his fingers clamp down on me.</p><p>The next thing I know we\u2019re headed up to the counter, telling the waitress that we\u2019d like our food to go. Then we wait very impatiently, sneaking touches when no one\u2019s looking, and sometimes when people are looking, until our food arrives at the counter in to-go bags. Ethan pays and then we leave, driving across the street to this sketchy-looking motel that has about five rooms total. I don\u2019t care, though. I just want him now. It\u2019s amazing what he can do to me just with the simple promise of being inside me, how far I\u2019ve come because of him. I remember when sex was just numbing. I felt nothing. Felt like I was too worthless to enjoy it. Then Ethan came along and all that changed. He made me feel alive and worth something.</p><p>Almost every moment is perfect with him and hopefully we\u2019ll have a thousand more moments just like this.</p><p>Ethan</p><p>Normally, I would have said we didn\u2019t have enough time to stay for an extra night, not if I want to stop at all the places I want to on the way home. But all of that stops mattering the moment I start thinking about being inside her. Hell, I\u2019ll give up making a stop in Tennessee like I was planning on... see one less mountain as long as I can just touch her a little bit longer.</p><p>My dick\u2019s so hard it fucking hurts. Touching her like that, especially in public, feels so forbidden and it\u2019s such a turn-on, especially when she touches me back. Only Lila can challenge me like that and get me so riled up. I swear to God I was on the verge of peeling her clothes off and slipping inside her right there in the booth. Luckily for the sake of giving everyone in the caf\u00e9 a live porn show, we managed to make it across the street to a crappy-looking motel. It\u2019s definitely not the best place in the world and I\u2019m a little worried that Lila\u2019s going to flip, but as soon as we step into the room, her lips collide with mine and she\u2019s stripping off her shirt eagerly.</p><p>And just like that I get lost in her; all the stuff bouncing around in my head momentarily dissipates as my tongue explores her mouth. Our bodies line perfectly together as she traces her fingers up my back, shivering when I do the same to her. I sketch the lines of the tattoo on her back as I steer us through the dark toward the bed. Moments later, we stumble backward and the mattress collapses beneath us as we land on it together. I brace my weight onto my arms, her head pinned between them, as I keep kissing her. Her legs drift to my hips and she bends her knees and wraps them around my waist, hitching her ankles behind my back. She starts to grind her hips against me, making my cock go rock-hard. I move with her, letting her veer toward the edge while I try to hang on, wanting to be inside of her so goddamn badly my body is pretty much sweating in desperation, but she\u2019s too close to coming and I want to see her lose it before I slip inside her because I enjoy watching her get lost like that, especially when I\u2019m the one doing it to her\u2014making her feel like that. So I keep going, watching, her eyes glazing over. Finally she stops moving with me, her muscles tightening as she cries out. Her head falls back and her eyelids flutter shut as she drifts off, her fingertips delving into my shoulder blades so sharply I feel the skin break. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019ve never been so turned on in my life.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Lila,\u201d I groan, begging my body to hold on just a little bit longer.</p><p>She breathes ravenously, her chest heaving as she blinks lazily. When she looks at me again, she has a content look on her face and a faint smile. \u201cYour turn,\u201d she says, and then she nudges me to move.</p><p>I more than willingly obey, rolling off her and onto my back. She stands up on the mattress and slips her shorts and panties off, then undoes the button on my shorts and removes them, along with my boxers. She takes a condom out of the back pocket of my shorts before tossing them aside. My hand glides up her leg to her waist, pulling her toward my mouth, but she wiggles out of my grip, tears the condom wrapper open, and puts it on me. Before I can even respond to her touch, she\u2019s straddling me and lowering herself onto my cock.</p><p>I grip her waist as her warmth surrounds me and I lift my hips and rock inside her, slowly, savoring every single goddamn aspect of the moment.</p><p>\u201cGod, this feels so good,\u201d she mutters in ecstasy as she lets her head fall back and rocks her hips with me.</p><p>My hold on her waist tightens as I give another slow thrust into her, deeper this time. \u201cYeah, it does...\u201d</p><p>We start to move rhythmically together, having orgasm after orgasm, getting lost over and over again inside each other. I think we break our record for how many times we have sex in one night\u2014it\u2019s five now. Exhausted and sweaty, we finally settle down for the night, holding on to each other as we drift to sleep. She falls asleep first and I end up just watching her breathe softly in my arms, never wanting to move. Never wanting to do anything ever again but this. In fact, I can actually see myself doing this over and over again with her. Every night...</p><p>Shit. I\u2019m thinking about the future and I\u2019m so... Confused... This is such a perfect and beautiful moment and I wish I could just stay like this forever with her. Yeah, we\u2019re starting the long drive home tomorrow, but I want things to say the same when we get back. I have a revelation as I think about heading home. I meant what I said in the truck. I want more road trips like this with her. I want to hold her in my arms in a shitty motel one day again in the future. I don\u2019t want to lose her\u2014I realized that when I thought she was breaking up with me at the rock. I want her and I don\u2019t want to be scared to want her so much.</p><p>I\u2019m suddenly fucking freaking out as I realize something. My biggest fear is right in front of me and I want to get over it, but I\u2019m not sure I can. Making sure she\u2019s still asleep, I get out of bed, go over to my suitcase, and take my journal out. The moment the pen touches the paper, my feelings pour out of me. When I\u2019m done, my hand is shaking, but I have the truth right here in front of me. And I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m terrified, happy, relieved, or what.</p><p>But one thing\u2019s for sure. I need to tell Lila.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Lila</p><p>Last night was amazing to say the least and when morning comes around, I feel like skipping and singing because I feel that happy. But instead we end up going for a hike and I listen to Ethan chat about the wildlife. Sometimes listening to him can be magical, especially when he\u2019s just laid back and not overthinking things. It happens a lot when we\u2019re hiking.</p><p>\u201cI seriously could just live up here and write all day,\u201d he admits as he sits down on the top of the hill we just hiked up, stretching his legs out and staring down at the rolling hills and small town below.</p><p>I sit down with him and crisscross my legs. There\u2019s a gentle breeze blowing through my hair and I have to pluck strands of it out of my mouth. \u201cWhat would you write about? The view?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and shrugs, squinting against the sunlight. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure... something, though.\u201d</p><p>I rest back on my hands and lean my shoulder into his, breathing in his scent of cologne, mixed with campfire and a hint of dirt. \u201cDo you think one day you\u2019d like to become a writer?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs again, glancing at me out of the corner of his eye. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought that far ahead of what I\u2019m going to do for the rest of my life... what I want to be.\u201d He looks down at the ground, seeming confused, and I\u2019m suddenly reminded of the bigger problems ahead of us, ones that I want to shove aside for now.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe one day you should think about what you want to do,\u201d I dare suggest. \u201cIt could be fun, you know. To write for a living. Well, at least for you since you seem to love it so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m good,\u201d he says with a smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you can write like how you talk sometimes, then I\u2019m sure you are.\u201d I pause, considering my next words carefully. \u201cOr you could just let me read some of the stuff you wrote.\u201d I actually heard him last night when he thought I was asleep, scratching away in his journal, and I wish I knew what he was writing about.</p><p>He pauses, biting at his bottom lip, and for a second I think he\u2019s considering it. I start to get a little excited and nervous, because I might finally get a full insight into what goes on in that head of his. What he thinks and feels\u2014what he sees when he looks at me.</p> <p>But then he says, \u201cTrust me. You don\u2019t want to read what goes on in my head.\u201d And my hopefulness crumbles.</p><p>I fake an exaggerated pout. \u201cYes, I do. I promise. Even if it\u2019s bad, I want to know.\u201d</p><p>He stifles a smile as he leans in and grazes my bottom lip with his fingertip. \u201cStop pouting to try and get your way,\u201d he says, and then he kisses me.</p><p>We kiss until we\u2019re panting and then we pull away, breathless and sweaty. We relax for a while and look out at the land below us, enjoying the view and the quiet and I know at that moment that he\u2019s happy because it\u2019s the kind of moment he loves.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d Ethan says, startling me. \u201cI don\u2019t really write stories. Just my thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t that what all stories are?\u201d I ask. \u201cJust someone\u2019s thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but my journal isn\u2019t like a book,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bunch of rambling about how I feel... about stuff... and my feelings... It\u2019s sort of how I discover what I\u2019m really feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout me?\u201d I sound a little nervous.</p><p>He looks even more nervous. \u201cYeah, sometimes I write about you and how I\u2019m feeling about you.\u201d He pauses with his mouth open, like he wants to say more, but then he snaps his jaw shut.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever write anything mean about me?\u201d I hold my breath in anticipation.</p><p>He shakes his head, looking stunned by my question. \u201cI would never write anything bad about you. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why can\u2019t I read just a page or two?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can let you,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cNot sure if I\u2019m ready yet...\u201d He trails off, staring out at the hills in front of us, looking as lost as we probably do out in the middle of thousands of trees. If it wasn\u2019t for him, I\u2019d never be able to find my way back. Thankfully, he has a good sense of direction.</p><p>I want to press him more, because I\u2019m really curious what he\u2019s writing about all the time, but I can tell his mind\u2019s already wandering, so I seal my lips and pretend to be happy. Eventually he starts to get up. I bend my legs to stand up, too, figuring we\u2019re leaving, but he puts a hand onto my shoulder and gently pushes me down to the ground. Then he winds around behind me and sits down, putting a leg on each side of me and winding his arms around my waist. He pulls me against him and buries his face into my neck, kissing it. \u201cThis past month has been amazing,\u201d he whispers, and sucks on my neck, rolling his tongue out, teasing my skin with kisses. \u201cI really wish we could stay this way.\u201d</p><p>I let my head fall to the side to give him more room to tease my neck. \u201cWe can\u2019t just live in a tent forever... as much fun as it\u2019s been, I really can\u2019t wait to have a real roof over my head.\u201d</p><p>He moves his lips up my neck to my earlobe. \u201cWhat if we built a cabin for us to live in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would we do that?\u201d I ask, breathless as his kisses make my skin dot with goose bumps. \u201cOr better yet, how would we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave up.\u201d He makes a path of kisses down my neck as his hand slips underneath the front of my shirt. \u201cBuild one. Move out here. Live. Write. Do whatever the hell we want for the rest of our lives.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My heart hammers inside my chest, wondering if this conversation is headed where I think it\u2019s headed. \u201cForever? Just you and I?\u201d Is he talking about our future?</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he says distractedly, and then he presses his fingertips to the side of my jaw and kisses me deeply, leaving me more confused than ever.</p><p>But like always, his kisses make me forget my confusion.</p><p>Ethan</p> <p>I\u2019m messing this up. Really, really bad. There was a reason why I wanted to take her up here\u2014some things I want to say about us that I discovered last night\u2014but now I\u2019m chickening out and panicking. I suddenly feel like I\u2019m fourteen again and the weight of the world\u2014the pressure\u2014is building up and crushing me. I need to calm down.</p><p>I start kissing her as a way around it, knowing that eventually I\u2019ll have to break the kiss and finally just tell her how I feel. About us. About our future. But I kiss her for as long as possible, until she\u2019s gasping against my mouth and I\u2019m gently pulling at her hair. I can tell we\u2019re only a few more heated moments away from peeling off our clothes and having sex right here on the trail. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time, and yet I carefully pull away, nibbling on her lip before sitting up straight.</p><p>She looks flustered. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Her fingers travel up the front of my chest to the top of my shirt, where she grips at the fabric, trying to guide me back to her. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to relive the Fourth of July incident?\u201d</p><p>I smile as I recollect the Fourth of July. Fireworks exploding over the lake in front of us. Trees surrounding us. Hiding under a blanket, listening to people chatter in the distance as we made love, knowing that at any moment someone could walk up the trail and see us. Neither of us really cared. In fact, it made things more exhilarating.</p><p>\u201cNot just yet,\u201d I say, cupping her cheek. \u201cI actually need to talk to you about something.\u201d</p> <p>Her forehead creases as she sits up, then kneels and turns to face me. \u201cIt\u2019s not bad, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as I can get it out right, it isn\u2019t.\u201d I let out a loud exhale, preparing to do something I never thought I\u2019d do. \u201cThe thing is, you keep talking about marriage and stuff and it really freaks me out,\u201d I tell her, and when she frowns I quickly add, \u201cBut it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t think about where we\u2019re going to be down the road... if we\u2019re going to end up together... be together forever.\u201d I put my hands on her thighs as she watches me with worry. \u201cI actually think about it a lot. More than I actually realized... Something that I sort of discovered after writing last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did writing reveal to you?\u201d she asks, biting on her bottom lip as I smooth my thumb across her cheek.</p><p>\u201cThat you and I will end up together.\u201d I swallow hard, hating that I have to add the last part, but I need to if I\u2019m going to be honest. \u201cHowever, I don\u2019t think we should get married soon.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes, which wasn\u2019t the response I was expecting. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should get married soon either,\u201d she says, inching closer to me. \u201cI just wanted\u2014no needed\u2014to know we\u2019re headed somewhere that could maybe lead to that one day. And that you feel the same way as I do about being together in the long run.\u201d</p><p>I tangle my fingers through her hair \u201cYou know I love you, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says, leaning in for a kiss. \u201cAnd I love you too.\u201d</p><p>I pull her in for a quick kiss and then rest my forehead against hers, shutting my eyes, preparing myself for the next thing I\u2019m going to say. Something that terrifies the shit out of me because it\u2019s so permanent and the even scarier part is that I want it to be. \u201cI want to do something.\u201d</p><p>She catches her breath. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I slip my hand up the back of her shirt and place my palm over her tattoo on her back. \u201cI think... I mean, I want to get another tattoo.\u201d</p><p>I feel her lashes flutter against me as she opens her eyes and slants away. I open my eyes but keep my hand on her back right between her shoulder blades. She\u2019s giving me a baffled look, her eyes wide and searching mine.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d she says. \u201cHow do we go from our future talk to you getting a tattoo? I mean, if you want to get another tattoo, that\u2019s totally okay with me. You look hot with them... but I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Chuckling under my breath, I cover her mouth with my hand. \u201cLila, I meant that we should get tattoos together. Ones to mark this trip. And the beginning of our future... ones that sort of go together.\u201d When she looks like she\u2019s starting to relax, I remove my hand from her mouth. \u201cI knew this couple with really cool matching bands on their fingers and I thought maybe we could get something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to get a matching tattoo with me,\u201d she says, a little shocked. \u201cBut it\u2019s so permanent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s sort of the point.\u201d I pause, wondering why she\u2019s not excited about this. I thought she would be, but maybe I\u2019ve been reading her wrong. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to. I just thought...\u201d I trail off as she gets to her feet and starts to walk toward the trail.</p><p>I quickly get to my feet and hurry after her. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>She glances over her shoulder at me, heading toward the trees at the bottom of the hill. \u201cI want you to show me what you wrote last night.\u201d</p><p>My expression falls. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She turns around, walking backward with a grin on her face. \u201cI want to see how you really feel\u2014I want to make sure that you\u2019re not just doing this for me because I\u2019ve been pressuring you. That you really want this as much as I do. And if it does seem that you want to make that sort of leap with me, then I\u2019ll totally do it, but if not, then...\u201d She turns around as she reaches a steep spot on the hill where the ground gets a little loose.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you don\u2019t think I want this, then what?\u201d I ask, catching up with her and placing my hand on her back to help her down the steep slope.</p><p>\u201cThen we won\u2019t get the tattoos right now,\u201d she says, stumbling a little, and my fingers enfold her waist to catch her from falling.</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you wanted a commitment?\u201d I ask, taking her hand as we reach the flat section at the bottom of the hill.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she says as we duck to enter the trees. \u201cBut I also want to know for sure that you want it. And if you do, then great, and if you\u2019re not ready for it, then you\u2019re not ready for it.\u201d</p><p>I grow a little nervous. \u201cBut what if what I wrote freaks you out?\u201d</p><p>She aims a disbelieving look at me. \u201cAre you kidding me? After all the stuff I put you through, you think that something you wrote in your journal is going to freak me out?\u201d She pauses as we reach the open section of the trail where the trees are sparse. \u201cYou helped me through addiction, family problems, and helped me find myself. I don\u2019t think anything you wrote could be more intense than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far,\u201d I say, unsure if I want her to read anything in my journal. It\u2019s like giving her insight straight into my head.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to, then that\u2019s fine,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to get matching tattoos until I know for sure that you want this and aren\u2019t just saying so because I\u2019ve been weird about commitment lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never say anything but the truth,\u201d I remind her. \u201cEven if it\u2019s harsh.\u201d I pause, tugging my free hand through my hair, thinking about what I want and what I don\u2019t want and which one is more important. But in the end only one thing matters\u2014what she wants. \u201cI\u2019ll let you read it... but just prepare yourself... I always write what I say and sometimes... well, I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019re going to interpret it... whether you\u2019re going to see it as me wanting a future with you.\u201d</p><p>She swallows hard and then lets out a loud exhale, looking nervous. \u201cWell, I guess we\u2019re about to find out.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Lila</p><p>I don\u2019t want to get too happy just yet. I need to make sure that he wants something linked to me branded on his gorgeous body forever. I don\u2019t think that Ethan would ever lie to me, especially with something this big. He\u2019s always been really truthful in the past, but the only way I\u2019ll be able to truly know is if I read his words. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looks nervous as we sit in his truck, the sun glaring in through the windows. He\u2019s flipping through the pages of his journal, searching for the right page, and I try to stay calm in the passenger\u2019s seat, hoping there\u2019s nothing in there that\u2019s going to upset me.</p><p>He finally stops flipping through the pages and takes a deep breath before he looks up at me. \u201cJust make sure you read the whole thing. It starts off kind of\u201d\u2014he struggles for the right words\u2014\u201cunsure in the beginning, but it gets better.\u201d</p><p>I nod and then reach across the seat toward the journal. He glances at it one more time, seeming torn, before he reluctantly hands it over. I take it and put it on my lap, feeling a little uneasy as I read the first word on the page: confusion.</p><p>\u201cJust start right here?\u201d I ask, tapping the top of the page with my finger.</p> <p>He nods and then turns toward the window, staring at the vacant motel parking lot to the side of us. I swallow hard, tell myself to go into this with an open mind, and then with caution, I start to read.</p><p>Confusion. That\u2019s what I feel every time I think about the future. I hate thinking about where I\u2019m going to be in a few years\u2014where I\u2019m supposed to be. If I had my way, I\u2019d take things day by day. Never think about the next day or about the past. I\u2019d live life in the moment. Breathe it. Live freely. It\u2019s so much less stressful than worrying all the time about where I\u2019m going to be down the road or who I\u2019m going to be with. I already lost someone once that I cared for. And the idea of losing Lila is like a hundred times worse than that. I\u2019m not even sure if I could get over her if I tried. And what if I didn\u2019t lose her, but we just ended up despising each other like my parents and her parents do. That would be equally as hard. It seems so much easier just to stay away from that deep of a commitment and avoid all the \u201cwhat ifs.\u201d</p><p>The problem is it\u2019s sort of selfish to think this way about life, especially when I\u2019m not the only one in my life. Lila is such a huge part of me. She\u2019s more than that. Over these last couple of years, she\u2019s become my best friend and not opening up to her completely because of my fears is wrong. She\u2019s the person I love more than anyone else in this world and if I have to open my eyes for a moment, and look forward, all I see is her. God, it\u2019s the truth... She\u2019s all I want. That much I know. I never want anyone else to go through all this shit with me\u2014to go through life with me. And if I have to decide one thing right now about my future, it\u2019s that I want to be with her. I want her with me. Even five or ten years down the road. Even when we\u2019re thirty or forty. Even if it means we could possibly turn out like our parents, I want to try. I want to try to have a future with her. What the hell happens between now and then I\u2019m not so sure. But do I even need to be sure about that yet? Maybe I only need to be sure about one thing. And that\u2019s her and I always being together. Even through the shitty times. I\u2019d never go back and change a damn thing. Every single thing that we\u2019ve been through has gotten us to this moment where she\u2019s lying in the bed beside me and just her being here makes me so content. I breathe easier. I don\u2019t even want to think about being on this trip alone. Yeah, I love the quiet, but it could never compare to all the moments we\u2019ve shared together. Fireworks. Arguments. Ponds. Kisses. Sex... God the sex is great. Every conversation with her, good and bad. Every moment, light and dark. I want to relive it over and over again. I want so many more moments and conversations.</p><p>I want this to be permanent. I want Lila and I to be permanent.</p><p>Forever and Always.</p> <p>I try not to cry. I really do. But I\u2019m an emotional person and this... well, I never ever thought anyone would ever feel this way about me.</p><p>As my tears start to stain his beautiful words, I quickly shut the journal so the ink stays intact. I quickly wipe my tears with my hand, look up at him, and before he can speak, I say, \u201cSo where are we going to get the tattoos?\u201d</p><p>Ethan</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d take what I wrote. Yeah, the ending was good, but the beginning... well it was full of my fears. And then she starts to cry and I\u2019m a little worried she\u2019s maybe misunderstood what I was trying to convey in my journal. I\u2019m about to ask her what\u2019s wrong, but then she says she wants to go get the tattoos. I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m a little scared, but in a terrifyingly good way. I want this. I knew it the moment I wrote the word permanent.</p><p>After we decide to get the tattoos, I drive us over to a tattoo shop on the main section of town between a row of shops. We go inside and start looking through the examples on the wall, but Lila keeps frowning at them.</p><p>\u201cI want something that we come up with,\u201d she says, resting her arms on top of the glass countertop. \u201cSomething that\u2019s just yours and mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA symbol?\u201d I ask. \u201cOr words?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWords,\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cI think you should come up with words that connect us.\u201d</p><p>I point at myself. \u201cWhy does it have to be me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d She walks up to me and hooks her arms around my neck. \u201cYou put words together beautifully. I seriously think you should consider the whole writer thing.\u201d</p><p>I press back a smile, feeling my heart speed up with panic and fear and excitement. \u201cOne future move at a time, please,\u201d I say, and she laughs. I let a slow breath ease past my lips as I try to think of something to put on our fingers. There\u2019s not a lot of room and I know the artist is probably going to tell us that more than one word is too much. I think about the last words I wrote in my journal and how they were so huge because they made me realize that moving forward with Lila was something I wanted.</p><p>\u201cHow about forever and always?\u201d I say, taking her hand in mine and tracing my finger around her ring finger.</p><p>She glances down at her hand, puzzled. \u201cWhat, you take forever and I take always? But then who would take the word and?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cHow about both of us.\u201d</p> <p>She glances up at me with her brows knit. \u201cYou want to split up and? Like you take the a and half the n and then I take the other half and the d?\u201d she asks, and I nod. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that look a little weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it really matter if it looks weird?\u201d I ask. \u201cIt\u2019d mean something to us and that\u2019s all that matters, right?\u201d</p><p>She considers what I said and then a smile breaks through. \u201cI really love that idea.\u201d She pulls me in toward her and we kiss until a very bulky dude with tattoos covering his arms comes into the waiting room to see what we want. When I explain it to him, he looks at me like I\u2019m some sort of punk kid who\u2019s stupidly in love. I don\u2019t really give a shit what he thinks, though, and feel perfectly content with his disgusted look as he draws up the designs.</p><p>When he\u2019s finished, I decide to go first since Lila seems nervous, like she was when she got her first and only tattoo. I take a seat and the guy puts the drawing on me, making sure it\u2019s where I want it. When we get it in the correct place, he gets the needle ready and I shut my eyes, feeling myself change the moment the ink touches my skin. I can feel myself moving forward with each stroke. Feel myself connecting to Lila. Feel that I\u2019m exactly where I want to be. Right in this moment with her.</p><p>Lila</p><p>I get so nervous around needles. It took a lot just to get me in the chair for the first and only tattoo I\u2019ve ever gotten. Then I damn near fainted the first minute into it. But Ethan stood by my side and reminded me why I decided to do it. Because I want to be free and wanted to have something that would forever represent my journey toward freedom.</p><p>But watching Ethan mark his finger with something that would always connect him to me is different. It makes me feel even more free and alive. Excited. Overwhelmed. Loved. It\u2019s the perfect moment that ends too quickly because suddenly he\u2019s finished and it\u2019s my turn.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you want to do this?\u201d he teases, stretching out his fingers as we trade places.</p><p>I eagerly and very anxiously nod as I plop down in the leather chair. The large guy with a lot of colorful tattoos on his arms who did Ethan\u2019s tattoo tells me to put my hand up on the armrest. He seems sort of cranky, but I don\u2019t care. Nothing could ever ruin this moment, not even a cranky guy who smells like he\u2019s in dire need of some deodorant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stay quiet as he positions the drawing on my finger until he gets it in the right place.

The only person I\u2019ve ever trusted. The only person who saw who I really am and the potential of what I could become.

I\u2019ve changed for the better. I\u2019ve had a lot of moving, life-changing moments. But this one is different. This one is epic. I can feel it through the blissful pain that makes me hyperaware of what I\u2019m doing. And when I\u2019m finished, I feel genuinely happy even though my finger aches.</p> <p>\u201cSo?\u201d Ethan says as I get up from the chair. He watches me, like he\u2019s waiting for me to say I regret it.</p><p>I stare down at my ring finger with a big grin on my face. I\u2019ve always pictured myself with a huge diamond on my ring finger, a carat at least, but now... well, this feels so much better. So much more personal and intimate. Nothing could mark our relationship better than this.</p><p>I glance up at him, looking him straight in the eye. \u201cI think it\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>He smiles back at me and then slips his fingers through mine. It makes the area of the tattoo sting a little, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to pull back.

Living in a tent and eating camp food again. Taking baths in the pond.\u201d He grins. \u201cHaving sex on the shore of a lake, hiding under a blanket.\u201d</p><p>I smile, feeling happier than I\u2019ve ever been because I know Ethan will be in my future and that\u2019s all I ever wanted, and as long as I have him, nothing else matters. \u201cSounds perfect.\u201d</p><p>About the Author</p><p>The New York Times and USA Today bestselling author, Jessica Sorensen, lives with her husband and three kids.

My arms are flailing, my pulse fitfully racing as I struggle to get my bearings. I open my eyes, but I can\u2019t place a single thing about the room I\u2019m in other than I\u2019m naked in a bed, sweaty, and super gross. My head feels like it\u2019s stuck in a fishbowl as I try to recollect where I left my pills, but I can\u2019t even remember where I am. There are photos on the walls, none of anyone I recognize, though. The closet is open and it looks like there\u2019s some kind of football uniform in there. Did I sleep with a football player? No, that doesn\u2019t sound familiar. My gaze slides to the opened condom wrapper on the nightstand and I feel relief wash through me. I\u2019m on birth control and everything, but that only protects from pregnancy. God, I really need to stop doing this.</p><p>I\u2019ve become accustomed to these kinds of situations, waking up in unfamiliar places with a headache, panic, and consistent, recognizable shame inside me that I know belongs there, just as much as the air in my lungs and the blood in my heart. I don\u2019t deserve to feel anything better after the decisions and choices that I\u2019ve made. I know what I am on the inside now and I don\u2019t fight it anymore. It\u2019s both liberating and heartbreaking because this is how I have to be\u2014who I am\u2014and it\u2019s sad. But I can smile on the outside, show the world how happy I am, since that\u2019s what\u2019s important, even if I\u2019m dying on the inside.</p><p>The routine is very simple and I know it like I know the back of my hand. I open my eyes, take in my surroundings, try to remember something, and then when all else fails, get the hell out of there. I slowly sit up, trying not to wake the guy lying in the bed next to me. He\u2019s got dark brown hair and a pretty sturdy body, but his back is turned to me and my memories are hazy, so I can\u2019t place what he looks like from the front. Maybe that\u2019s for the best, though. Whatever I was looking for with him\u2014love, happiness, a blissful moment of connection\u2014obviously never happened. And I\u2019m at a point in my life where I doubt if it ever will.</p><p>Holding my breath, I climb out of bed and slip my dress on, covering myself up, along with the scar winding around my waist, reminding me of why I\u2019m here. I attempt to get the back row of buttons done up, but my fingers are numb, like I was doing something weird with them last night, which could be a possibility. I do have tendency to get a little extreme when I\u2019m that drunk. The fingernails sometimes come out, and back in boarding school I got deemed the slutty biter/screamer. Although, sometimes I wonder if I do it out of pleasure or from the fear that seems to surface when I have sex. And that confusion is his fault. I\u2019ll always hate him for that, even if I thought I loved him and would have done anything for him at the time. But how could I really, when I was way too young to feel love? Even now, I still haven\u2019t felt it and I\u2019m twenty years old.</p><p>Leaving my dress unbuttoned, I collect my shoes and tiptoe toward the door. I notice a wad of cash on the nightstand beside the bed and a ring that looks like a football championship ring or something. There\u2019s also a stale sandwich on the dresser and several empty beer glasses.</p><p>\u201cEw, I must have really been drunk,\u201d I mutter, cringing at the food and then double cringing when I catch my untidy appearance in the mirror on the wall.</p><p>Making a repulsed face, I slip out of the room, thinking I\u2019ll be out in the hallway of one of the dorm buildings on campus. But I\u2019m in a large, open living room with columns around the walls and picture windows everywhere, letting light easily flow in. The floor is marble and there\u2019s a large white rug spread out. It has to be a condo or something, with how fancy it is, not a dorm.</p><p>There are a couple of guys and a girl sitting on a leather couch in the middle of the room, watching a flat-screen television mounted on the wall just beside where I stepped out. I can\u2019t remember anything other than shots, a chic club, a sleek black Mercedes, someone\u2019s hands and lips on me, wishing I could black out, and then I must have gotten what I wanted because after that I remember nothing.</p><p>The guys simultaneously look up at me and I notice they\u2019re older, like maybe twenty-four or twenty-five, which makes me feel too young to be here, yet older guys seem to be my thing, at least when I\u2019m drunk.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d One of them nods his scruffy chin at me. \u201cYou look a little lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, I\u2019m totally lost.\u201d I force a smile, even though I\u2019m frowning on the inside, and I hold my head high as I do the walk of shame. They start laughing at me and I find myself wishing I were someone sassier, like Ella, my best friend and old roommate. But I\u2019m not. Sure, I can be sassy when the time calls for it, but right now I feel icky, gross, and disgusted with myself because I just woke up, my makeup\u2019s worn off, my hair\u2019s a mess, and my clothes smell like alcohol. Plus I\u2019m crashing. Badly. And I don\u2019t have anything on me to help balance my mood.</p><p>I rush across the room and throw open the door. As I step out of the condo, I hear one of them laugh and say something about me being easy and slutty, but I close the door and shut out their voices. I walk down the hall and trot down the stairs to the bottom, where I push the door open and step outside into the sunlight and the lukewarm November air. Being outside makes me feel a little better, except I still can\u2019t recognize where I am. It\u2019s a condo complex\u2014that much I get. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCrap,\u201d I mutter, pressing my fingers to the brim of my nose. I have a splitting headache and my hair smells like beer and my pores feel sticky. I hike across the lawn toward the corner of the street so I can read the street sign, knowing it could be worse. I could be in one of the lower-class areas of Las Vegas, but this looks like it\u2019s a nice area, located near some cul-de-sacs and upper-class homes. When I reach the corner of the street, I shield my eyes with my hand and squint up at the street sign. Damn it, I\u2019m way too far away from my apartment to walk. I can either take the bus, which I haven\u2019t been a fan of since I was fourteen, or I can call someone. The only person I really know around here anymore\u2014the only one who I trust seeing me like this\u2014is Ethan Gregory. He\u2019s the one and only bad boy I\u2019ve ever had in my life and the one and only guy who\u2019s never wanted to sleep with me, which makes him seem less bad to me, but to all the other girls he sleeps with, not so much.</p><p>I first met him two summers ago when I went with my best friend Ella back to her hometown. He was the best friend to the guy Ella was in love with, Micha\u2014although she wouldn\u2019t admit it at the time. While those two were working out their problems, I spent a lot of time with Ethan and we hit it off. There was this strange connection between us, like we understood each other, even though we were from totally separate worlds: rich and poor. Even when I went back to school in the fall, we still talked on the phone. And then he moved here and we\u2019ve been hanging out pretty much ever since.</p><p>Cursing under my breath, I find my phone that luckily is still in the side pocket of my dress, and then I punch in Ethan\u2019s number.</p><p>He answers after three rings and his voice is laced with amusement. \u201cWell, hello, lovely Lila. What\u2019d you do this time?\u201d</p> <p>I ignore the ripple through my body that his voice always causes. After knowing him for a year, I\u2019ve pretty much become an expert at discounting the emotions he always brings out inside me, which is a good thing for many different reasons. For one thing we live in two separate worlds: I like nice things and Ethan is very unmaterialistic. He calls me spoiled a lot and I call him a weirdo because I don\u2019t get half the things that he does, like refusing to buy nicer clothes when he has the money for them. He\u2019s so sexy and if he\u2019d wear jeans without holes in them and new shoes and shirts he\u2019d look so much better.</p><p>Plus, even though I hate to admit it, my mother\u2019s words always echo in my head: If you can\u2019t find a man to take care of you then you\u2019ll end up living in a crack house, just like your sister. Find a wealthy man, Lila, and hang on to him no matter what sacrifices you make. Despite the absurdity of it, I can\u2019t seem to get the mental picture out of my head of me curled up in a ball on a ratty old couch, dressed in rags, smoking crack from a pipe, and it scares me.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything... I don\u2019t think anyway. I just need a ride,\u201d I say in a whiny voice because I\u2019m tired and filthy and disgusting.</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d he replies, pretending to be annoyed but I\u2019ve gotten to know him well enough to know he really isn\u2019t. He just likes people to think he is because he likes to seem tough and a badass. But I know he\u2019s not. He\u2019s actually really sweet and talks and listens to me and gives me candy canes. I still have a drawer full of the ones he gave me, unable to eat them or throw them away because then it feels like I\u2019m losing a nice moment in my life with a guy and those kind of moments are very rare, if nonexistent.</p><p>\u201cAre you there?\u201d he says, interrupting my thoughts.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I need a ride again.\u201d I sink down on the curb, attempting not to think of candy canes and red lacy bras. That was a one-time thing. We both agreed that there would be no hooking up. Although, I agreed to it only because he seemed so eager to make it clear it would never happen again. \u201cSo will you or won\u2019t you come pick me up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re snippy today,\u201d he remarks with humor in his tone. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think I want to deal with it today. I\u2019m too fucking tired from the woman I screwed last night. She really wore me out. Plus, I have to be to work later today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an ass.\u201d I scowl, even though he can\u2019t see me. \u201cPlease quit messing around and just come get me. Pretty please.\u201d</p><p>He pauses and then sighs, defeated. \u201cI\u2019ll come get you though, but only if you say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to say it, Ethan. Not today.\u201d I prop my elbow on my knee and rest my chin against my hand. He wants me to tell him that I\u2019ll be his sex slave, something he made me promise to say the last time he picked me up. He doesn\u2019t really want me to be one, though. He just thinks he\u2019s funny.</p><p>\u201cThat was the deal,\u201d he reminds me. \u201cIf I ever had to come pick you up again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I made the deal when I wasn\u2019t this cranky,\u201d I say and grimace. \u201cWhen it seemed like a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He surrenders way too easily and it makes me smile just a little. \u201cBut next time I\u2019m making you... In fact, I might even actually be your sex slave the next time you call me,\u201d he says and I sigh heavily. \u201cI\u2019ll head out in a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I tell him, stretching my legs out onto the road. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry for being so pissy. I\u2019m just hung-over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t go out with that douche from the club, did you?\u201d he asks and I can hear him moving around. \u201cBecause I told you the guy seemed sketchy. Although all the guys you\u2019ve hooked up with seem a little bit sketchy, if you ask me\u2014rich, preppy douche bags.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not douche bags. They\u2019re just different from what you\u2019re used to.\u201d I yawn, extending my arms above my head. \u201cAnd no, I didn\u2019t go home with the guy from the club... I don\u2019t think anyway. I can\u2019t even remember who I went home with.\u201d I cringe as I try to put the pieces together, but I can\u2019t even seem to find one full piece.</p><p>\u201cLila...\u201d he starts, but then decides against it, probably because he sleeps around just as much as I do. \u201cWhere are you exactly?\u201d</p><p>I breathe a sigh of relief, grateful he\u2019s not giving me anymore crap for my sexual mishap. I\u2019m hung-over and having withdraws and I can feel myself verging on a meltdown, something that can never happen, let alone in the open. \u201cI\u2019m on the corner of Vegas Drive and Rainbow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere exactly? In like a store or a house or something?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sitting on the curb.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s quiet for a moment. This isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s had to pick me up under these kinds of circumstances and it probably won\u2019t be the last. It\u2019s kind of our thing; we share our stories and never judge each other, despite how bad and ugly the stories are. He knows things about me that no one does, like how my father treats me, and I know things about him, too, like how his dad used to beat his mother and how he despises him for it. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in, like, fifteen to twenty minutes. Don\u2019t go wandering off anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would I go?\u201d I pull my knees up and lower my forehead onto them. \u201cIt\u2019s too damn hot outside to even breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd try not to get into any trouble,\u201d he adds, disregarding my comment.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I roll my eyes and then squeeze them shut, inhaling the sweltering air. \u201cAnd, Ethan...\u201d</p><p>He pauses. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you again,\u201d I say softly because I really do feel bad for making him do these things for me. He\u2019s always so nice about it, too.</p><p>Another pause and then he gives an overexaggerated sigh. \u201cWhatever. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>We hang up and I feel the slightest bit better. He\u2019s always there for me, even when he doesn\u2019t want to be. He\u2019s the only person I really talk to anymore and I worry what will happen if he decides to leave me.</p><p>I lie down on the sidewalk and twist my platinum ring around on my finger as I stare up at the melting blue sky and the blinding sunlight. For a moment I don\u2019t care about how filthy the ground is or the fact that my dress is undone and my eyes are starting to sting. In fact, for a split second I know I belong there and nowhere better. But as I press my cheek against the scalding concrete, I remember that I was taught not to lie on a filthy ground. I sit up straight and trace the ugly circular scars on each ankle, the mark of my biggest imperfection both inside and out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sun bears down on me as I attempt to remember some details of the previous night. But as usual, I\u2019m drawing a blank. If I keep it up, then I wonder if one day my head will just be as empty as my heart. But on the bright side\u2014my mother\u2019s bright side\u2014at least I\u2019ll still have my beauty and that\u2019s all that really matters.</p><p>Ethan</p><p>You know that point where you\u2019re about to wake up, but you can\u2019t quite seem to get your fucking eyelids to open so you get kind of stuck between being awake and asleep? Well, that\u2019s pretty much where I\u2019ve been for the last four years. I feel stuck. Trapped in the same place, unable to move. In a life I\u2019m not sure I want, yet I can\u2019t seem to figure out how to change it. I\u2019ve felt differently only once and the person who brought the sunnier side out of me is no longer in my life. Although, sometimes Lila gets me close to breaking out of the daze, but in a different way, one based more on anger and sexual frustration than an actual deep emotion.</p><p>I even tried to escape the trapped feeling of my life once. I packed my shit and hit the road with no real destination other than to escape the trapped feelings that had been festering inside me for years. It wasn\u2019t bad being alone on the road with no worries about where I was going, but what I learned quickly was that you can\u2019t escape life, no matter how much you want to.</p> <p>I wake up to \u201cHey Ho\u201d by the Lumineers. It\u2019s the ringtone Lila picked out for herself, even though I told her it wasn\u2019t my kind of music. She insisted that it was the perfect song choice for her, and I meant to change it but I forgot and now I just don\u2019t care. In fact, it\u2019s kind of growing on me, like her.</p><p>I run my hand over my face, rubbing the drowsiness away, and then reach for my phone on the nightstand beside my bed. I answer it and give Lila a hard time because it seems like it\u2019s becoming a tradition. She calls me when she needs help, usually with a guy-related issue and either I listen to her complain about it or go bail her out from whatever situation she\u2019s in.</p><p>It\u2019s the third time she\u2019s called me this month and it\u2019s only halfway into November. She told me once, over way too many shots of Tequila\u2014which always makes her dark alter ego come out\u2014that she\u2019d been like this since she was fourteen, never giving me an exact reason. Honestly, she seems to be going on a rapid downhill decline since Ella left, even taking a semester off of school, but I think that might have to do with money more than anything. But I\u2019m worried she\u2019s lonely or something. A lot of people can\u2019t handle being alone, and I think Lila might be one of those people.</p><p>I remember the first time we had a real talk, back in Star Grove, where we first met. Our best friends had a thing for each other and we kind of met through them. During the first real time we spent together, we drank a bottle of Bacardi while my dad repainted her car that someone had spray-painted, talking about life, our weird views on casual, meaningless sex, and how at one point in our lives our parents treated us like shit, although Lila\u2019s still do.</p><p>I\u2019d been flirting with her the entire night, because that\u2019s what I do and then Lila tried to get me to screw her. I\u2019d declined since we were both trashed out of our minds and I have rules about having sex and being wasted. I have to be sober enough that I can remember the sex\u2014and the girl. Plus, I don\u2019t think of Lila like that. Well, I try not to anyway. I have had a few slip-ups, where I crossed the no-touching rule I made, but I always make sure to play it off as casually as I can, reminding myself that I have rules about relationships for a reason, to keep me out of relationships because I don\u2019t want to end up like my mother and father. My father is always yelling at my mother and I\u2019m always worried I\u2019ll turn out like them\u2014or him really. Getting emotionally involved with someone leads to an unhealthy, disastrous relationship, where someone will get broken. Take my mother and father. She got pregnant while they were dating, they got married, and twenty-five years later they\u2019re still married and hate each other, although they\u2019ll never admit it. Instead, my father yells and tells her how stupid and shitty she is all the time and my mother pretends that everything\u2019s okay. That it\u2019s normal for people to talk to each other like that.</p> <p>The only exception I ever made was with London, and after what happened with her I promised I\u2019d never make an exception again because I never wanted to feel that much loss and guilt over losing someone again. But I really struggle with following the rules when it comes to Lila. I even had to add a no-touching rule that exclusively applied to her after I gave her candy canes last Christmas, about a year ago, when I tried to put my hands on and tongue in places they didn\u2019t belong.</p><p>Sometimes it is hard to keep my hands off her, though, and I slip up. The girl is fucking gorgeous, in a model, Hollywood, way-too-perfect actress kind of way. She\u2019s got flawless skin, perfect curves, her body proportioned just right. But she\u2019s kind of high maintenance. The first time I took her to a pub, she refused to eat the food because she thought eating pub food was too gross and kind of beneath her high food standards, but she\u2019s slowly progressing and I\u2019ve even got her to eat ribs with her hands once, which was hilarious to watch.</p><p>After I get off the phone with Lila, I put away the bracelet London gave me and my journal, filled with pages of haunting memories and thoughts. I took both of them out of my dresser during a bout of depression last night, trying to find something that doesn\u2019t really exist anymore, because I chose to walk away from it. Or maybe it never really did exist, yet I continue to hold on to it and allow it to haunt me, never talking to anyone about it because the idea of talking about London aloud seems impossible and almost like I\u2019d finally be letting go of her and I\u2019m not ready for that.</p><p>I get up and get dressed in jeans and a red T-shirt, then grab a five from my stash of money hidden in a box underneath my dresser. I work part time in construction and since my apartment is dirt cheap and I don\u2019t really need anything else besides food, gas for my truck, and occasionally new clothes, I pretty much save everything I make. Tucking the five in my back pocket, I head out the door. I make a quick stop at the nearest Starbucks and use the five to splurge on getting Lila an iced latte because I know she loves them and it might help her with her hang-over. It\u2019s early in the afternoon, but still warm. That\u2019s Vegas for you, though. Even the fall seems like summer in most areas.</p><p>When I finally reach the corner of Vegas Drive and Rainbow, I park the truck where Lila\u2019s lying down on the sidewalk with her legs stretched out into the road.</p><p>I hop out of the truck and shut the door. \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d I ask, rounding the front of the truck with the iced latte in my hand. \u201cTrying to get run over or something? Jesus, Lila.\u201d</p> <p>She angles her head back and peers up at me. Her blue eyes are bloodshot, her mascara is smeared, and her blonde hair is all tangled. Usually she\u2019s so put together, even when I pick her up the morning after, and it\u2019s a little bit shocking to see her like this. Still, she\u2019s beautiful as hell, but I\u2019ll never admit that to anyone out loud.</p><p>\u201cIs that for me?\u201d Lila eyes the coffee, licking her lips.</p><p>I hand it to her and she guzzles it down, then pulls a face. \u201cDid you have them put nonfat milk in this?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. Sometimes she can be so high maintenance. \u201cNo, I forgot your specific instructions, your highness, but you\u2019re welcome for getting it for you.\u201d</p><p>She glares at me. \u201cThank you,\u201d she says with an attitude and then starts sipping on the drink again and I struggle not to ask questions about the condition she\u2019s in, because I want to know what the hell happened to her and how she ended up here, looking like she does. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything,\u201d she mutters, then gradually straightens her legs. She gets to her feet and brushes the sand off the backs of her legs. \u201cI\u2019ve had a rough morning as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean a rough afternoon,\u201d I correct her and then step back from the curb with my hands up in front of me when she targets me with a death glare. \u201cFine. Jesus, I\u2019ll keep my mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She walks toward the truck door, drinking from the straw and swaying her hips. I notice the back of her dress is unbuttoned all the way, so her smooth skin is exposed to the sunlight. God, if I didn\u2019t have my rules I\u2019d seriously bend her over and have her take it from behind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I check her out for a little bit longer and then back up toward the driver\u2019s side. \u201cWhy\u2019s your dress undone?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs, swinging her shoes in her hand. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get my fingers to work this morning.\u201d</p><p>My lips threaten to turn upward into a full on smirk. \u201cWhy? Were they preoccupied too much last night or something?\u201d I joke, and suddenly way too many images of her flood my head, her fingers sliding up her inner thigh and then slowly entering herself.</p><p>She jerks the door open, narrowing her eyes at me, and I add, \u201cWhat? You\u2019re the one who brought it up. If you don\u2019t want me to tease you, then don\u2019t set up the punch line.\u201d</p> <p>Shaking her head, she presses her lips together and hops into the truck. She\u2019ll be pissed off at me for, like, the next ten minutes, but then she\u2019ll get over it. She always does.</p><p>After I get in the truck, I pull out onto the road and turn up the stereo. We barely speak the entire drive and when I pull into the parking lot of her apartment, I figure she\u2019ll bail and then call me in a few days when she needs me to rescue her again.</p><p>But when she opens the door, she says, \u201cSo are you coming in or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess, if you really want me to.\u201d It\u2019s not like I have anywhere else to be. Micha, my best friend and old roommate, is gone and I don\u2019t work on the weekends anymore. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sleeping with you no matter how much you beg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never beg,\u201d she says and then her face contorts with confusion as she frowns down at the ground. \u201cAt least from what I can remember I don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>I climb out of the truck and meet her around the front, aiming the keys over my shoulder to lock up the truck. We make our way across the parking lot beneath the heat of the sun and I pull my sunglasses down off my head to cover my eyes. I remain slightly behind her, checking out her ass and her lower back peeking out of her still-opened dress. Finally, I have to rip my gaze away and step up beside her, otherwise I\u2019ll end up unable to keep my hands to myself.</p><p>\u201cYou need to stop blacking out when you get drunk,\u201d I say, nudging her playfully with my shoulder. \u201cDrunk is okay, but getting so shit-faced you have no idea what you\u2019re doing is really fucking bad, Lila. Even I\u2019m not that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not bad at all.\u201d She attempts to smooth her hair down with her hand, but it only makes it stick up more. \u201cYou just pretend like you are. But deep down, you\u2019re a really nice guy who likes to write in a journal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I told you that in confidence.\u201d I scowl at her as we make our way up the steps to her second-story apartment. \u201cYou were never supposed to utter that aloud.\u201d</p><p>She pats her pockets for the keys. \u201cWell, then you never should have told me because I kind of have a big mouth.\u201d Her arms fall to her sides and her eyes scan around her feet and then down the steps behind her. \u201cCrap, I think I lost my keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay... so go ask your landlord to unlock it for you. It\u2019s not that complicated,\u201d I say, shaking my head at her.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t ask him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I lean on the railing, squinting against the sunlight as I assess her.</p><p>She lowers her chin, allowing her hair to fall in her face, like she doesn\u2019t want me to see her expression. \u201cBecause... if I do... then he\u2019ll ask me for rent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask. \u201cAre you behind on it or something?\u201d</p><p>She peers up at me through her eyelashes. \u201cI may or may not have paid the last couple of months,\u201d she discloses, her forehead furrowing.</p><p>\u201cWhy? You\u2019re not broke.\u201d I hate to say it, but it\u2019s kind of obvious by the fancy clothes she\u2019s always wearing. Hell, she\u2019s got a platinum ring on her finger, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cBut I am,\u201d she insists, crossing her arms over her chest. \u201cMy dad canceled all my credit cards a while ago and I have only, like, eight hundred bucks left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen pay your rent with it.\u201d I gape at her. \u201cOr pawn that ring on your finger.\u201d</p> <p>Shaking her head, she covers the ring on her hand, looking almost panicked. \u201cNo way. This was a gift from someone I used to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019d rather live on the streets than get rid of your gift?\u201d I cock my eyebrow at her. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really,\u201d she says simply, her arms falling to her sides.</p><p>I tighten my jaw, growing frustrated. \u201cGod damn it. You do this all the time, you know that. You need to start being more responsible...\u201d My eyes widen. Holy fucking Jesus, I sound just like my father. Shit. He\u2019s always lecturing my mom about her flaws. This is the reason why I don\u2019t let myself get into relationships and I\u2019m not in one with Lila, so why am I acting like this?</p><p>She laughs scathingly and jabs her finger against my chest. \u201cOh, and like you are. You get drunk and sleep around and work in construction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I never claim to be responsible.\u201d I lean in, lowering my voice, trying to shake off the feeling that I\u2019m acting just like my dad. No, this is different. You\u2019re trying to help her, not control her. \u201cBut I do work and pay my rent.\u201d</p><p>She huffs, stomping her foot and crossing her arms. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve witnessed her temper tantrums when I don\u2019t give in to her, but it still gets on my nerves as bad as the first time I saw her do it. \u201cEthan, will you please just help me out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the fuck am I supposed to help you out?\u201d I ask. \u201cPay your rent so you can get let in? Because I\u2019m not doing that.\u201d But a voice inside my head laughs at me, telling me I\u2019m full of shit. That I would pay it for her if she asks, that I\u2019d do anything for her if she flat out asked me to.</p><p>She sticks out her bottom lip and makes me soften just a little. \u201cYou can pick the lock,\u201d she suggests, and when I start to frown, she grips the bottom of my shirt and clutches on to it. \u201cPlease, please, please. I\u2019ll owe you big time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already owe me big time, for being a pain in the ass and calling me all the time to come pick you up from random guys\u2019 houses,\u201d I tell her, dragging my hand across my face. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want you to owe me. I just want you to get a job or something so you won\u2019t get kicked out of your apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll work on getting some cash.\u201d She bats her damn eyelashes at me intentionally\u2014I can tell because there\u2019s a smirk forming at her lips.</p><p>Sighing, I stick out my hand. \u201cGive me one of those pins in your hair.\u201d</p><p>She releases my shirt, plucks a pin out of her hair, and hands it to me. Grunting and pretending I\u2019m more annoyed than I really am, I bend down in front of the door and quickly pick the lock. When I shove the door open, she jumps up and down, clapping her hands.</p><p>\u201cThank you! Thank you! Thank you!\u201d She throws her arms around my neck and embraces me tightly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me,\u201d I tell her, uneasy and kind of turned on, something I always feel whenever she hugs me. Lila is off limits. She\u2019s a friend. Just a friend. It\u2019ll never work out. Relationships never work out. Look at the one that you had. \u201cJust pay your damn rent and quit losing your keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, boss.\u201d She rushes into the house eagerly, leaving the door open behind her, and hurries toward the hallway. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a quick shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell am I supposed to do?\u201d I ask, standing in the entryway of her two-bedroom apartment, which is much nicer than mine: painted walls, a crack-free floor, and the carpet isn\u2019t loose. \u201cSit around here and wait for you? Is that what you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend like you\u2019re totally not enjoying the idea.\u201d She pauses at the corner of the hall and grins. \u201cBesides, you could just come join me.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes, suppressing a smile. \u201cI\u2019ve already told you a thousand times that you can\u2019t handle me, baby.\u201d I bite down on my tongue on the baby slipup. I don\u2019t use endearing terms with women. Ever. My dad used to use them on my mom when he was trying to kiss up to her after he beat her and she\u2019d always let him butter her up. It made me hate affectionate terms and affection in general.</p><p>She turns around and puts her hands on her hips, arching her eyebrows. \u201cAnd vice versa.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t doubt it,\u201d I say, because I picture Lila as being extremely bossy and orderly in bed and I like women who get caught up in the moment, who love to do things without thinking about them first and who can completely and utterly let go of everything going on in the world. Who don\u2019t care if they have money or material things. I like women who are like London. The problem is, she seems to be the only one of her kind and she no longer exists.</p><p>Lila laughs and I roll my eyes again, feigning annoyance. Then I chuckle when she sticks out her tongue and I have to bite on my own because the movement draws all my attention to her mouth. Despite the no-touching rule I made, I still can\u2019t help but picture the many things I\u2019d like her to do with her mouth that would require a lot of touching.</p><p>Once she vanishes down the hall, I get comfortable on the sofa and start channel surfing, but I can find only three channels and I wonder if she hasn\u2019t paid her satellite bill either.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Lila,\u201d I mutter and then take my phone out of my pocket. I think about just calling Micha and asking him to ask Ella, Lila\u2019s best friend, to call Lila because she\u2019s obviously gotten in over her head, but then it just seems weird and makes me seem like I\u2019m scared of Ella, so I call her myself.</p> <p>She answers after two rings and I can tell from her tone of voice that she\u2019s trying to figure out why I\u2019m calling her. \u201cEthan?\u201d she asks warily. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cOr maybe... I don\u2019t know... it all kind of depends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn whether you\u2019ve talked to Lila lately or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard from her in, like, a week,\u201d she says. \u201cI texted her the other day, asking her how she was, and she said she was fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I think she was lying to you.\u201d I slump back in the sofa and something pokes me in the back. \u201cMaybe you should call her.\u201d I reach around behind my back and pull out an empty prescription bottle. The label\u2019s ripped off so I can\u2019t tell what it was for. I wouldn\u2019t think anything of it, but I used to keep my drugs in something similar and it gets me wondering. No, there\u2019s no way Lila would be doing drugs. She\u2019s way too fucking preppy. I twist off the cap, glance inside, and then take a sniff. It doesn\u2019t smell like anything I\u2019m familiar with. Shaking my head, I put the lid on and toss it onto the table in front of me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve actually really needed to call her,\u201d Ella replies. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been meaning to tell her... something...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being weird,\u201d I point out, kicking my feet up on the table.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d she admits. \u201cBut I\u2019m being like that for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you have a reason then I guess we\u2019re okay,\u201d I joke sarcastically with a heavy sigh. Ella and I have always had this issue with each other, due to the fact that it always felt like she was interfering in Micha\u2019s and my friendship. We\u2019re not as bad as we used to be, but our clashing personalities will always sort of hinder us from being good friends. \u201cLook, can you just call her and talk to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she there now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but she\u2019s in the shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where are you?\u201d There\u2019s insinuation in her tone.</p><p>\u201cSitting on the couch.\u201d I click the television off with the remote. \u201cWhere else would I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She pauses and I know whatever she\u2019s about to say is going to irritate me. \u201cIn the shower with her or watching her take one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not,\u201d I say dryly, more offended than I probably should be. \u201cLook, just call her, okay? I\u2019m going to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she mutters. \u201cGod, you\u2019re in a bad mood.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure who hangs up first, but we probably do it at the same time. I\u2019m about to put my phone away when I get a text. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s Micha, because I figure Ella went and told him that I was being a jerk, but I\u2019m surprised to find that it\u2019s from London\u2019s mom, Rae. I haven\u2019t talked to her in more than seven or eight months, around the time I decided to give a go at living my lonely wanderer dream, living my life to the fullest, mainly because Rae had called me and reminded me of everything that happened, the stuff I\u2019ve tried to forget\u2014the life I tried to forget, yet I always feel imprisoned by it. But when I hit the road, there was the whole Micha and Ella drama. Micha was boozing it up, going completely fucking crazy because he thought Ella cheated on him. I remember when I got the call from Lila telling me what was up.</p><p>\u201cYou need to go to New York, now,\u201d she\u2019d said.</p> <p>\u201cUm, no thanks,\u201d I\u2019d replied. \u201cI\u2019m trying to escape people, not go to a city packed with way too many of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what you want,\u201d she said, sound like a spoiled brat, which she did a lot. Then she proceeded to tell me how Ella had told her, after multiple shots, that she\u2019d only told Micha she\u2019d cheated on him because she thought it was the only way he\u2019d let her go. That he was too good for her and her insanity and deserved someone better.</p><p>As much as I agreed that Ella was insane, I didn\u2019t think the two of them should split up. They have the kind of love that most people, including myself, will never understand or experience. I don\u2019t think I even had it with London.</p><p>So I\u2019d agreed to go to a city I hated, to help fix the problem and try to make things right between the two of them even though it wasn\u2019t my responsibility. Why do I always try to fix things? I have no fucking clue other than it drives me crazy when other people are acting crazy when clearly they have it really good.</p><p>I slide my finger over my cell phone screen and read the text over.</p><p>Rae: I know we haven\u2019t talked in a while, but I wanted to check up on you and see how you were doing.</p><p>That\u2019s not the real reason why she\u2019s texting and I know it. She wants the same thing she wanted from me seven or eight months ago.</p><p>Me: I\u2019m fine.</p><p>Rae: Have you thought anymore about taking a trip to Virginia?</p><p>Me: Not sure I can.</p><p>Rae: Why not? You know it\u2019d be good for both of you.</p><p>Me: No, it wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Rae: Please, I really need your help... London\u2019s getting worse.</p><p>And there it is. The real reason she\u2019s texting me. She wants hope. She needs to know that she\u2019s doing everything right. And she wants me to give her the resolution. But I can\u2019t because giving her false hope\u2014going there and seeing London\u2014means finally letting go. And I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for that yet, whether I can allow myself to let go and fully accept reality. That what\u2019s done is done and I have to let go and move on.</p><p>Me: You know it\u2019s not going to do any good. It didn\u2019t the last time I tried and from what you told me seven months ago, everything\u2019s still the same with her as it was after the accident.</p><p>Rae: But I want to change that. If you\u2019d just come visit her, you might be able to change it. You were so close to her when it happened.</p><p>No, I can\u2019t. No one can. You know this\u2014everyone does\u2014and I don\u2019t want to see what I lost. My finger hovers of the button as I deliberate what to type back to her.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, I feel so much better,\u201d Lila says, tousling her wet hair with her fingers as she walks out of the hallway wearing only a towel. My jaw nearly hits the floor. It\u2019s a really, really fucking short towel, one that gives me a view of her thighs and if she turned around, I could probably see the bottom of her ass.</p><p>\u201cIs that a hand towel?\u201d I ask, half joking, half serious.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replies simply. She seems more relaxed and laid-back than when I picked her up. \u201cJust a normal towel.\u201d</p><p>I try not to stare as she sinks down on the sofa beside me. She doesn\u2019t even bother trying to keep the towel closed and I get a glimpse of her thighs, which I\u2019ve touched once so I know how soft her skin is. Just seeing them, I have to ball my hands into fists so that I\u2019ll keep them to myself.</p><p>\u201cI really needed to get last night off of me,\u201d she says, shaking her hair out. It falls against her bare shoulders, sending beads of water trickling down her skin. \u201cI felt so gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you were being so bitchy?\u201d I stuff my phone into the pocket of my jeans. I need some time to think and process what she\u2019s asking me to do and if I can finally do it, not to give her hope but to say my good-bye. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shrugs, examining her fingernails. \u201cI guess so,\u201d she says nonchalantly, putting her hand on her lap. \u201cHey, do you want to go out tonight or something?\u201d Lila smiles cheerfully at me as she relaxes back into the sofa, with her hair swept to the side. \u201cDrinks are on me for being a pain in the butt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can,\u201d I say evasively. \u201cDid you get a phone call from Ella by chance?\u201d</p><p>Lila shakes her head and twirls a strand of her damp hair around her finger. \u201cNo, but I left my phone in my room, so maybe I missed a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should call her.\u201d I pat her bare leg, slipping up again on one of my rules that I set with her: no inappropriate touching.</p><p>I\u2019m about to quickly pull away when she shudders under my touch and my muscles ravel as my palm presses against her warm, slightly damp skin. We both freeze and I swear to fucking God I can hear both of our hearts pounding insanely. This isn\u2019t the first time that an awkward, intense moment has happened between us and I\u2019m starting to think it won\u2019t be the last. I know I should pull back, because it\u2019s going to go somewhere beyond the friend zone if I don\u2019t, but her breathing accelerates, her chest rapidly rising and falling, her breasts heaving up and down with her deep, ravenous breaths. My cock goes hard and the idea of touching her is so tempting. Suddenly, like my damn hand has a mind of its own, it\u2019s slipping up her leg. Her skin is as soft as I remember. I knead my fingers into her thigh and she shudders again, her whole body quivering.</p><p>As my hand drifts higher up into the towel, my thoughts wandering to how it would feel if my fingers were inside of her. Fucking good, I\u2019m sure. Way too fucking good. I could find out. I know she\u2019d probably let me, but the fact that she would so easily makes me feel guilty. She lets just about everyone touch her, but not because she\u2019s a slut. I don\u2019t believe for one second that she is. There\u2019s something hidden inside her that she\u2019s trying to cover up with sex. I can see it in her eyes sometimes, when she gets really quiet. Sadness. Self-doubt. Self-torture, even.</p><p>She\u2019s not like that now, though, seeming more content and subdued than anything. My hand lingers on the top of her thigh, my fingers brushing toward the inner section, which is even softer. I can feel warmth radiating off her and wetness. God damn it, she\u2019s getting wet and I can feel it, which only makes me want to feel more. As my fingers make a path inward, just about to brush across her wetness, she grips down on the armrest and moans. Actually arches her neck, tips her head back, and fucking moans. My pulse hammers as my fingertips press down into her skin. Fuck.</p><p>\u201cEthan... God...\u201d Her hair falls back from her shoulders, her chest bowing upward, and I nearly attack her with my lips, lick a path up her leg, slip my tongue inside her, something I\u2019ve wanted to do since the first day I laid eyes on her.</p><p>My fingers dig deeper into her skin, as confliction settles inside me. Pull my hand back. Keep going. Somehow I manage to snap my thoughts away from my cock and swiftly pull my hand away. I can\u2019t believe I screwed up again. I\u2019ve always had my rules about fucking around with girls who I had any sort of feelings for.</p><p>I\u2019m practically sweating as I get to my feet, digging my keys out of my pocket, hoping she doesn\u2019t notice my cock bulging in my shorts. \u201cI got a few things to do, but I\u2019ll check up on you a little bit later.\u201d I wait for her to say something about what just happened, that I almost stuck my fingers inside her, but all she does is frown up at me.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to check up on me.\u201d She adjusts the bottom of the towel over her thighs, crosses her legs, and covers herself up a little. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly okay by myself.\u201d She smiles at me but it looks fake.</p><p>I move for the door. \u201cI\u2019ll check up on you later,\u201d I repeat, then open the door and step out into the sunlight, angry with myself for messing up and extremely angry at the part of me that wanted to mess up and throw my rules right out the window. I set them for a reason. To stop myself and others from getting hurt.</p><p>As I head to my truck, my phone beeps from inside my pocket. I retrieve it and check the screen. Rae again. I think about texting her back and telling her that I won\u2019t go to Virginia. But part of me wants to see London again, even if she\u2019s not the same London I fell in love with. I want to say good-bye, yet I don\u2019t. And part of me wants to run back to Lila because for some reason, being around her makes me feel better. I\u2019m so confused at this point as thoughts of both London and Lila clash in my head. Who do I hold on to? London? The girl who I thought I once loved? The girl I lost and will never get back? The girl I walked away from, just left to shoot up? The girl who I wanted to know more than anything, but I missed my chance? Or should I just let her go? Release my guilt of walking away from her that day, just like that. Go around fucking girls, living life, doing whatever I want? Deep down I know I should have never walked away from her that day and that if I\u2019d stayed instead of thinking solely of myself then things might have been different today. Perhaps I\u2019d still be with her.</p><p>I can\u2019t let her go yet\u2014can\u2019t let go of my guilt. I should just be alone. It\u2019s for the best.</p><p>I end up skipping on sending back a text to Rae, knowing that by doing so I\u2019m allowing myself to continue to hold on to the idea of London and continue to think of Lila sitting up in her apartment in the hand towel at the same time.</p><p>My fucked-up thoughts are giving me a headache. \u201cShit,\u201d I mutter, kicking the tire.</p><p>I really fucking need a drink. </p> </body></html>"]
